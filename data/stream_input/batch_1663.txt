B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked 50<br />Shades of Gray you will love this book.  I could not put it down.  I can connect with the people in this book.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Great movie but poor HD picture quality. It's a waste of money. I'm way better off renting a Blueray disc.
1600242197|5.0|Great book! Marcus has a story that is literally unbelievable. I found myself wanting to drive around a little longer just to hear more. It is a raw story though, wouldn't suggest it for those offended by language or graphic detail of what goes on in an actual war situation.
B0090EKRKU|1.0|Very bad picture and I ordered HD. Even my son notiiced the blurriness of the picture. I'll never go online to watch movies unless it's improved.
B007SGM084|5.0|Don't let people talk you out of this book!!! It's great just keep an open mind and don't be easily put off when the story gets heated with detail!! I would suggest this book for anyone who is into the romance story with a tortured man who needs a strong female roleto bring him happiness.... With a little kinkiness mixed in
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This is probably the best you tube downloaded app for the android platform.  However, that does not mean it is without flaws.<br /><br />For instance, a new iteration my fix or break some of its functionality.  For example, the version previous to 1.05.39 didn't allow me to save anything.  Which is annoying when every time I launched the utility it was asking me to download the failed version.<br /><br />Fortunately, 1.05.39 fixed that.  However, for the time that this app was broken, I was looking for an alternative to Tube Mate, but I just didn't find it.  I found some good back up YouTube Downloaders, but none of them give you the integration with YouTube or the range of save formats that TubeMate does.<br /><br />So try it, but beware of its pitfalls.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of the wildest rides of any book I have ever read! If you have not read any of the Reacher series of books read this one and you will be hooked 100%. I read it on my Kindle and I would not know what to do without my reader . Receive books before they are generally available in the bookstores.<br /><br />I have read all of the Reacher series and find them all to be excellent in the reading and mystery departments. Action on every page, heart racing waiting to see what happens to different characters in the story line and don't want to put the book down. I almost read it all in one night but had to stop because of recent eye problems. Got up early, finished the next morning before breakfast.<br /><br />THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR REACHER FANS AND IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN YOU WILL BE BEFORE YOU FINISH THE BOOK!!!!<br /><br />Ward Kinard
B004FECNIO|4.0|scare tactics to whom? satisfying snuff scenes for bored masses? punish crime of efficiency, and result in reduced production?, the mechs will go into hiding b/c they fear death? or the owners who dumped them firstplace so no worries for repercussions allround, developers would be last type of audience member and hardly a concern for the upgrade, job security!!!  so guess we are just beyond grief when gorgeous Joe goes, and the best scenes to come forever in the imagination, ack... visuals are staggeringly stunning, inspirational and thought provoking beyond need, and enough with the predictable heart strings Stevie!! the hanging Osmets, Stanley would have savored the most... requires multiple viewings to enhance value added content, but stream of consciousness herewith is the spirit so heartily endeared, hence, voila!
0817439390|5.0|This is an absolutely must have book if you don't already know how to use, or are intimidated by manual mode on your camera as well as how to nail the correct exposure everytime. Bryan makes it a point to explain in plain english, without all the technical jargon, exactly what to do and how to do it correctly. I never knew it was so easy until I finished reading this book.
B0000YEEGM|3.0|nothing is more exhilirating than a Vegas run on the table and the penthouse suite comped... for a super sensory autistic? not so much, but heh, who cares bout that inconsistency when we can see Dustin n Tom making woo in the moonlight of the hotel bedroom... interesting deja vu of Tom's disdain for mental disorders and all ya gotta do is ignore symptoms and life improves dramatically, no meds!!! yeah....  very touching tale of lost love, and heart wrenching compassion for a condition not well known even today... Dustins character interpretation is abs olutely flawless and incomparable... i.e. Forest Gump, Sgt. Slade, etc. well perhaps Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot could possibly compare but high recommend just for this metamorphisis and certainly fondest memories of the Vegas strip of yore....
B00377E5SG|5.0|I rarely like a remake ... and I never thought I'd like a remake of anything originally done by  Audrey Hepburn ... but as they say, there's  an exception to every  rule.  This is a stellar remake and I highly recommend it.  Still love the original, but this one is superb.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was expecting more of this book but I feel it didn't deliver.  With more than 80 characters it became confusing and I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  It seemed to drag on for me and I kept expecting something big to happen.  I was disappointed in the book and felt I could have spent my money better elsewhere.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The season starts off really slow. However, as time passes the intensity and the use of fringe science picks up throughout.
0345803485|2.0|The negative reviews of this book are FAR more entertaining than the book itself.  I'm seriously laughing out loud at how true they are.  I've been disabused of the notion that this book gets better.<br /><br />I had to stop reading the book and check out the reviews when I got to a scene where Christian asks Ana if she's on her period, takes out her tampon and continues to have sex with her after her reiterating several times that she's bleeding, and then they take a bath together all the while she's bleeding.  OMG E L James!  WTF?  TMI!!!!  Was that supposed to be sexy?  Can we all agree to pretend that periods and birth control don't exist while writing erotica?  Because any sense of sexiness that might have come across in that scene was murdered when he pulled out her bloody tampon and threw it into the trash can.  Ew.  I'm not sure I can finish this book.  Similarly, there were way too many references to him taking out \\"foil packets\\" and putting on condoms.  And once they moved past that stage of the relationship he still needed to confirm that she was taking the pill.  Come on!  If you're deciding if you want to read this book, think about if you want to read a book where BLOODY TAMPONS are added into a sex scene.  If that doesn't turn you on, pass on this book.<br /><br />My other biggest pet peeve about this book was that it was obviously written by a Brit.  I won't bother tallying up all of the ridiculous things that Ana said that an American NEVER say.  E L James should have made the main character British and called it a day.  Half of the book sounds like a historic romance.  I'm not even sure that modern people in the UK speak the way that Ana and Christian do.<br /><br />And add me to the list of people that want to bite Ana's lip off.  Does anyone really walk around biting their lip, or get turned on when someone else bites their lip?<br /><br />In summary: repetitive, unbelievable, jacked up accents, controlling stalker, foil packets, and BLOODY TAMPONS.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was mad with the first book until chapter 12.  Now I can't put book 2 down.  Can't wait to read book #3
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book sucked me in from the beginning.  It is hard to figure out the line between history and fiction but I did learn alot about WWI
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was my first mystery/hidden object puzzle game and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it! It cost less than a dollar and I was able to play for hours at a time.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun! I would definitely recommend this!  The only problem is that once it lost my high score, and I had to re-do everything. But, I still love it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was discussed so many times that I felt compelled to read it for myself. I wouldn't consider it an excellant journalistic endeavor but it certainly \\"spiced up\\" my otherwise ordinary reading enjoyment. I found myself wondering how the author learned of the techniques displayed in the book. I suppose a lot of background material was necessary. But from whom did she acquire such material? I also found myself wondering whether any of her readers would actually try some of the techniques described in the book. I would recommend this book to take on vacation or during a boring airplane flight. The reader should not take too seriously the content.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Great book enjoyed reading all three books and had to read a second time as it was that good will read again soon as well
B001HC8516|5.0|This was a fantastic read! Cannot reemember the last book that left me laughing out loud as much as this book did. a must have for anyone tackling the dating world...also makes some hard truths more paletable thru humor.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Super! I can use it on the go. It has the keys and buttons I need. I would recommend it 100%!!!
B000W178XO|5.0|If you like Johnny Cash, and who doesn't, you'll like this CD. It has all his hits on it that I'm aware of (I'd categorize myself as a casual fan, not a die hard). It also has some of his later work. His cover of Hurt is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard and he does a wonderful job. Highly recommended.
B00000I5Y6|3.0|I bought this specifically for the Carry on my wayward son song which i luv. There's another song or two that i like as well. I'm not much for this kind of music but Kansas is pretty cool.
B005OP821K|4.0|Was a good series. I watched on my Kindle, both at home and during my lunch at work. It's an interesting series and I've been keeping up with the second year.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|awesome game, I just wish we could buy al the upgrades with the in game funds. people tend to lose interest in a game when you cant go any farther than what is there. could you set it up to be optional?
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|This review is not about the movie but the specific product.  I totally agree with all the other reviews about the digital copy.<br /><br />I just wanted to add that playing the digital copy itself causes problems after it is copied to my laptop.  First off, it \\"only\\" works if I plug my laptop via HDMI to my TV.  It will NOT work if I try to watch it on the laptop display.  Windows Media complains that my hardware display is \\"insecure\\".  That is just BS.  So the advertising of \\"watch anywhere, any time\\" is wrong because it's just not true.  I didn't have problems with X-Men, Thor or previous Marvel movies so this encryption/security is just causing more headaches as a movie fan.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|O.k. so it took me some time to actually break down and read this book after hearing about it from all my friends. I must say I really was not that impressed. This book would be amazing to women who have had boring, uneventful sex lives. <br /><br />The ending was awful. I get cliff hangers, but that was an abrupt stop before the cliff, if you get what I am saying. I might borrow the other two Grey books, but i will not buy them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is a great way to get my pinterest fix whether I'm at work, rocking my baby or just trying to sneak in some &quot; me time&quot;. It's perfect :)
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The book is amazingly well constructed and beautifully written. But, that aside, it is funny. The bit about the last line of the last verse of the last chapter of the last book in the bible is priceless.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic Puzzles is a great game to play when you are bored and just want to waste time. It takes putting puzzles together to a new interactive platform.  The great part about the game is the ability to download different puzzle packaging, so you can never get bored of doing the same puzzle over and over again.  Also, the ability to make the puzzle pieces smaller or larger allows you to chose to your ability the level of difficulty you would like to play on.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I can sleep...I love that the app has multiple combinations that include music.  the auto off is why I downloaded it, and it works great!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love this app on my K.Fire!  Great graphics and definetly challenging. I enjoy trying to beat the clock to achieve all 5 stars.<br />Yes, it does freeze up once in a great while but I'm not entirely sure if that's the app or how many I have running.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series! Very easy to get into and a very quick read. Very violent, kids killing kids but done as well as that could be done.
B007J2TMQ0|3.0|Ok, it is not that I doubt all that the author says in the book, but I lack some footnotes explaining the documentation that some parts come from. For instance, I remember a conversation between Ribbentrop, Hitler and the british ambassador: the source of this must be the personal diary of the ambassador or something like that, a footnote clarifying this (and many other facts in the book) would be very helpful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great series! Very easy to get into and a very quick read. Very violent, kids killing kids but done as well as that could be done.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|DVD was perfect!  Great gift and arrived on time.  I was very pleased. I will order again with you guys for the third season.  Thanks.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good series. Not for the conservative reader. Very exciting and a great deal for all three. I would recommend getting all three at the same time.
0140557741|3.0|I'm not sure, but, this wasn't really all that impressive to me.  I mean... yay... the whole concept is neat, but I read such RAVE reviews that I guess I was expecting something more exciting?<br /><br />I hope this doesn't make me sound like a jerk... I really WAS looking forward to something cool arriving!  I gave it to my nephew and he was kind of bored with it right off the bat - and he's very easily excitable!!  He opened it and paged through and was like \\"meh.\\"  I can't really blame him.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|What an Awesome movie would recommend this for sure. Shipped fast and no damage. Perfect for yourself or for a gift.
B000W1YYSQ|5.0|\\"2112\\" is pretty much about the time Rush really started showing their true talent and what they are capable of. With this album, Rush showed that they could compete with all the mainstream bands out there. This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded and a must-have. Definitely worth the money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series! Very easy to get into and a very quick read. Very violent, kids killing kids but done as well as that could be done.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was looking at for my next read when I stumbled upon Anthony Ryans novel. I was initially hesitant but the synopsis and the sheer number of 5 star reviews convinced me to give it a chance and I was not disappointing in the least. I read the book in 2 days, it's one of those books that you come across which makes you read to 4am on a Wednesday even though you have to get up in 2 hours. Yeah that good. So I highly recommend it to anyone looking for there next great read, there are some grammatical and spelling errors but its a self published ebook so take that with a grain of salt when you read it. Oh and for the guy who gave this amazing story a one star review, your insane. You can't smash a book because you don't like it and then say that you only read half of it. Would you have liked Star Wars if you stopped the movie halfway through and then never saw the ending or plot twists? No, you watch it to the end and then make an opinion so finish reading the book its really quite lovely.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Bill Nighy and Judi Dench are fabulous. It's inspiring for both older and younger people. My seven-year-old daughter loves it, too.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I wasn't a big fan of this band before, especially after catching them live. BUT, this album is more heavy, more rock, and the production on it is super slick! Awesome production - maybe a little over produced. But I enjoy the heck out of it, especially title track \\"Blood\\". Curious how they pull it off live.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book....this series....this writer!!! Great books!!! Its not just a love story its so much more.....its real.....!!! I would reccomend this book to any adult reader!!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I like the game, but EVERY time you hit the button for a new deal its an ad...the video ads you can't skip for several seconds but the regular ads you can at least skip immediately. Not happy, would rather download a different version of this game.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|The book started a bit slow for me, but then drew me in and I very much enjoyed it. The twist and turns in the book are clever. Would recommend.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Seemed a little slow in the beginning since the characters needed to be re-introduce to readers who have not read Zero Day. Once the action started it was non-stop and I did not want to put the book down.  Great job and a solid sequel! I heard there is a third book already in the works - hope we don't have to wait too long for it.
1433203286|5.0|There were some things I really loved about I Am Legend. First, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too. The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending. The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me. I wasn't expecting what happened, at all. It is very much the most important part of the novel. It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe. I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.<br /><br />A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.<br /><br />Yes, this book is Legend.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I'm half way through the book and its amazing I like how he used different stories to explain the habit process.<br />Really recommend this book. Great persuasion tool :)
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|this tame is soooooo boring. Even though it is free it is not a good buy.  :( all u do is fling birds @ buildings.
B005RUV714|5.0|I must comment on this movie.I was looking for a good show with all the episodes of the season.The walking Dead season 2 is it.It has action,drama,and suspense.I like the characters playing their roles.It's like real natural people on the run from these walkers or zombies and everybody has very good acting skills.Even the freaking dreadful zombies have great acting skills.<br />This Walking Dead season 2 makes all the other zombie shows before it look immature.It took me 2 full days to watch the entire season and I enjoyed every second of it.<br />I look forward to season 3 and I really do not think there is a better zombie show out there.Try it and you will believe it's the best ever. Period !
B0098VYCCE|5.0|My kids and I loved this movie and will probably end up buying it now that we have seen it! Highly recommended!
034580404X|5.0|I ordered the trilogy for my wife & she loved them. She couldn't stop reading the books. She read them through twice. Very engaging and steamy. The sex was very explicated but written in a way that helped develop the story and character lines. I would definately recommend these books for anyone that wants a well-written romance and enjoys steamy sex tales. The author wrote the books in a way that make them very easy to read with good flow and well defined characters and story lines.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This is a cute app and my 5 yr old loves it. It's easy to manipulate and fun for on the fly entertainment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app does just what it should. Works on my android phone and kindle fire. Viewing and pinning is easy. Great APP!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend the Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1-5) is probably one of those books destined to end up on Science Fiction reading lists alongside some of the greatest sci-fi novels.<br /><br />With compelling characters, protagonists who are well defined, explained and likeable, Wool does not have any disappointing qualities. It is well written, keeps the flow going quickly and with style and most of all presents a story that draws the reader into its labyrinth with ease.<br /><br />I recently completed a Fantasy-Science Fiction class where we read some of the best out there. This could have easily fit into the curriculum.<br /><br />Great Job!<br /><br />Karen Bryant Doering<br />Parents' Little Black Book<br />MistBlueEeyore@gmail.com
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Bought the movie for my grand-kids. They love it and continue to watch it about once a week. I watched it and it was okay. My grans had read the book (all 3) so they understood the movie much better than me.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am neither a fan of the Harry Potter series or not a fan. I read them at the time my granddaughters and niece were reading the series to keep up with the books that had \\"taken over\\" their young lives. While I didn't find the Potter series to be especially well written, I always kept in mind that it was written for children. The Casual Vacancy is not a children's book and should not be read with the same kind of expectations.<br /><br />Knowing the setting was a small English village I looked forward to reading it. I love cozy's set in small towns, general fiction set in small towns and in fact, I live in a small town and am familiar with how they tend to operate. They are pretty much the same no matter what country you live in, because people are the same around the world. Having said that, this story may have been set in a small town but it reads more like a city.<br /><br />Was it good? No not really. Nor was it especially poor. The author tried a bit too hard to bring too many characters into the story which left character development rather sparing. I felt as if she were trying hard to create an epic novel which fell flat. The beginning was slow, the middle interesting and the ending was manipulative. I didn't find myself either liking or identifying with any of the protagonists which is a necessary feature if you want people to enjoy the story.<br /><br />No, Ms, Rowling, the ending did not make me cry. Instead I felt like I had run a marathon and come in so far behind the sponsors had already taken away the drinks table. Cut out a third and it just might work.<br /><br />Karen Bryant Doering,<br />Parents' Little Black Book<br />MistBlueEeyore@gmail.com
B001FD5KJM|4.0|I love this movie and the series. I will continue to watch movies like this. Minimal language, no sex and lots of action. Family friendly except of course for the mild violence.
0525953728|5.0|Very Interesting.  Well written and proves that this administration leaked much more specific information than the book does. Glad that the author had the nerve to let everyone know what really happened.  God bless our Seals, keep them safe and God bless America.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved the Battle of the Labyrinth! It was a great book. I read it last year and couldn't put it down! It was funny, breath-taking at parts, and ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't wait to read the next book. I especially liked the parts were Jackson was with Calypso! I felt soooooooo sorry for her when Jackson left !!!!!!:( But altogether this book really was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />So my advice? READ THIS BOOK AS SOON AS POSSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /> Lotte LeBlanc
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|This is just an opinion that is based on years of comic book reading. Especially when I was younger. How long ago was that? Late 50's. Thor was a huge man, muscles,big neck etc. Hulk never,or maybe not never, acted as though he was an Ape. He was an intelligent scientist  and to see the belittling of his figure lowered to that of a non thinking human was sad. Captain America was not 5'3. He was a hero in all the sense of the word. The bogus actions that I viewed in and around the car scene was at best disappointing. As for Ironman will nuff said. Hawkeye was well depicted. The CG added to the movie was ok but took away from most of the scenes. Overuse of this alternative reality has turned off the switch in my limited brain capacity. Having said that I believe that the HTLM5 is the only way to go in these adventures. The green screen that the movie companies are  now using does not allow for the actors to assume the identity of there characters.It is a shame, but I suppose  thats the way its going to go, and unfortunately I will have to long for the days of movie making without all the computer effects that dominate some of the new movies. This would also include the Lorax. Just my opinion. The movie itself was as best, average. My nine year old son would rate this movie a 3 star. Just asked him.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|this app is a good one because I like to play with the colors and graphs but other than that ya cant do much with it
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|The game wouldn't download at first. Finally it downloaded but will not install. Reports \\"retrieving from cloud\\" but never pulls up game. Tried several times.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|oh my gosh!  I love this app!  So helpful on my kindle when I need to know how much nattery I have left.  So convenient!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! I ended up buying the 1st of the other books by this author because I enjoyed this book so much. Quick, fun read that made me miss the characters after it was over.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this software is fantastic. i can save so many things and access them from anywhere i want! Totally worth having it in all my devices!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This game is cute and fun. However it would be better if the game went a little faster paced. All and all its cute.
B008VBYN80|4.0|awesome game I really like it but wish you did not have to spend real money.  and it takes way too long for energy to come back
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Why is this game so much fun? Being an actual bagger was not this much fun. I enjoy all the puzzles and challenges.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a classic and just as relevant to today as it was to the problems of the Dust Bowl Depression. The question he posed is how can the economical factors help with the sociological situation. It has got to be more than a 'bottom line' philosophy. There has to be a safety net with the ability to rise out of poverty. While Steinbeck wrote of the thirties, what makes this a classic is that still speaks the truth today.
0441013074|4.0|SPOILERS:<br /><br />In \\"Century Rain\\" Alastair Reynolds takes us forward to a time when the Earth has been devastated by a \\"nanocaust\\" that has made the planet uninhabitable. Verity Auger an archaeologist visiting Paris to gather antiques that might give a glimpse of of past to humanity finds herself facing a tribunal for the accidental death of a boy on her expedition. Her chance for redemption is to visit Earth or rather another Earth where it's 1959, World War II never happened and humanity is intellectually stunted never making the jump into the modern age. While there she has to discover the purpose of this alternate Earth which is enclosed in a structure preventing anyone from getting in or out.<br /><br />Verity must find out who created this alternate Earth which is identical to ours until World War II, why they are keeping scientifically stagnant and what Susan White a competing archaeologist discovered there resulting in her murder. Verity finds herself unexpectantly assisted by Wendell Floyd a private detective who has been hired to find out by someone else to find out who murdered White. Verity and Floyd unravel a horrible plan for the inhabitants of Earth 2 and must figure out how to prevent it.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Alastair Reynolds has demonstrated his terrific talent as a storyteller with [[ASIN:0575083093 Revelation Space]][[ASIN:0441020712 Blue Remembered Earth]] but, as with those books, \\"Century Rain\\" also demonstrates his weaknesses as a writer--Reynolds' characters can sometimes be a bit on the thin side. His other weakness is that he can't convey a love story convincingly as he demonstrates with \\"Century Rain\\".<br /><br />There are references to the classic movie \\"Casablanca\\" and other pop culture stories in his latest book without letting them overwhelm the story. I've noticed that some reviews are bothered by Reynolds' references to classic movies but, quite honestly, it's just another element that gives an additional layer to his storytelling for me.<br /><br />As with many of Reynolds' novels the story carries on for about 100 pages too long and the long chase that takes up the last third of the novel although effective (writing action and chase sequences is one of Reynolds' strengths), it goes on too long dragging out a story that begs to come to a conclusion sooner than it does. Having said that, once Reynolds finds his footing again in the story it seems like he rushes to the conclusion as if realizing he's gone on too long. It's not a major flaw but it is a bit distracting and does reduce some of the power of the last third of the novel.<br /><br />Some readers have asked the question or suggested that, perhaps, this is a \\"trunk\\" novel (i.e., an early novel that wasn't good enough to be published that was dusted off, rewritten and published because of the author's fame. I don't get the sense that \\"Century Rain\\" falls into that category as the storytelling elements that have become a hallmark of ALL of Reynolds' novels (the chapters that alternate subplots eventually merging into a single coherent story, etc.)are strongly presented here. If this is a \\"trunk\\" novel Reynolds has done a fine job of spiffing it up for publication and, in reality, it's better than some of his earlier novels such as the fine [[ASIN:0441010644 Chasm City (Revelation Space)]] which felt, to me, like a true \\"trunk\\" novel retroactively put into the \\"Relevation Space\\" series.<br /><br />Either way fans will enjoy \\"Century Rain\\" despite some shortcomings in characterization, an unconvincing love story that fits into the last third of the novel and a tendancy to meader before rushing to the conclusion. It's a very good novel that suggests that Reynolds is continuing to develop and challenge himself as a writer and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Recommended.r to his storytelling for me.<br /><br />As with many of Reynolds' novels the story carries on for about 100 pages too long and the long chase that takes up the last third of the novel although effective (writing action and chase sequences is one of Reynolds' strengths), it goes on too long dragging out a story that begs to come to a conclusion sooner than it does. Having said that, once Reynolds finds his footing again in the story it seems like he rushes to the conclusion as if realizing he's gone on too long. It's not a major flaw but it is a bit distracting and does reduce some of the power of the last third of the novel.<br /><br />Some readers have asked the question or suggested that, perhaps, this is a \\"trunk\\" novel (i.e., an early novel that wasn't good enough to be published that was dusted off, rewritten and published because of the author's fame. I don't get the sense that \\"Century Rain\\" falls into that category as the storytelling elements that have become a hallmark of ALL of Reynolds' novels (the chapters that alternate subplots eventually merging into a single coherent story, etc.)are strongly presented here.

0525953728|5.0|WOW!  One of the best books I have ever read!  You cannot put this book down! No secrets are written in this book. You will love it!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was so good! The effects, costumes, and scenes were amazing.  I loved the storyline and its variation from the original Snow White. Charlize Theron really took on her role as the queen and was a perfect fit! Chris Hemsworth made the movie that much better to watch, and can't wait for his sequel, the Huntsman.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it is a real good story and an awesome game. the graphicsl are out of this world. cant wait for part 2.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I gave this a try expecting to get bored really fast but here I am not just still playing it but giving it a 5 star review
1451627297|4.0|I think I have read only two Stephen King books, The Stand and Misery.  My memory of Misery is probably more related to the Kathy Bates movie then the book.  I really thought the premise of 11/22/63 was great, what happens when you go back in type and attempt to change history?  Especially a history many of us are familiar with.  Essentially, this is a love story, a love that takes place in the past influenced by the future.  But the past is obdurate.  A word that Mr. King uses, and uses and re-uses in this novel.  In the last chapter I think he used it five times, twice in the same sentence.  The word became infuriating to me, Mr. King couldn't use a thesaurus or his editors couldn't change the word? - stubborn, obstinate, inflexible all come to mind.  But it is lazy writing to use a word over and again.  The word stuck in my head and every time I read it, I simply said, not again.<br /><br />I recommend the book, it is interesting, the story held my attention and I enjoyed the premise.  Just watch out for the obdurate past, it will get to you.
B000VT6FAO|5.0|Today, I listened to Hourglass.  It had been a few years since I last listened to it (around the time it was first released).  Like many of DM's peak albums that proved their true worth years after their release, this album did the same.  In contrast, I feel that many of DM's later albums didn't age well (including Exciter); yet, today I felt that Dave's solo album stood the test of time.  It sounds very modern and soulful.  I can't reasonably comment on the lyrics, but I can tell you that nothing feels forced (a sign of amateur writing).  The music has some great soundscapes and the styles are electic.  Thumbs up because it was ahead of its time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it's nice to Pin on the go.  I don't have too many issues.  I do wish it had a scroll to the top button. though.
B00992CF6W|4.0|a few days ago I stopped playing because whenever I would try to access my world that I worked so much on, it just freezes and then crashes on my kindle fire
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just as described . I love the size of it. I just wanted something to do quick math with. @
B0098VXE50|2.0|The movie starts off well, but clearly begins to lag as Kristen Stewart becomes the focal point.  The scenes with Charlize as the Queen are the most intriguing part of the movie and she clearly steals the film.  In the middle where she is absent for large gaps, the movie drags.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This used to be an amazing app. Now it won't let me listen to music or download it. Some one fix this!!!
B0000009RT|5.0|In 1966 I graduated from a small high school (136 in our class) and was pretty middle class normal.  Within one year I was a left-wing pacifist, opposed to the war, and marching for integration.  So, what happened?  Well...a lot started when I began listening to music from the West Coast by this new band, The Mothers of Invention.  Then, it got even stranger when I listened to The 13th Floor Elevators, out of Austin, but that's another story.<br /><br />Besided the obvious call to question the status quo of our parents, The Mothers did one other change to my life, one that I didn't realize until I purchased this CD a month ago.  It was they who began my love of the classic sounds of the 1950s!  Musically, this album is all over the scene, from jazz to rock, to psychedelic sounds.  But, many of the songs are actually in a 1950s rock sound, and it was this sound that began my enjoyment of that era's music.  It didn't bloom until the 1970s, when I began to collect oldies, and found myself liking music from the 1950s as much as \\"my\\" music, the music of the 1960s.<br /><br />Unlike many of my old albums, which I had replaced with CDs, I had not heard Freak Out since I gave my vinyl albums to a charity in 1990.  I was very happy to hear these songs again, and realize how much I had missed them.  Suzy Creamcheese, buy this CD!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Just finished The Incredible Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, I read it in one day because it was just so beautiful. What an incredible story, fabulous characters and you cant help but just immerse yourself in this book. A new favourite book of mine.
1476712042|1.0|Don't bother.  This book is just plain stupid. There is nothing in this book that a high school freshman could not author.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I would recommend to others...not the best movie I have ever seen but def not the worst...we would probably even watch it a second time
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone girl was a bit of a slow start with a couple who goes through the painful process of a marriage falling apart and a cheating husband. You begin to strongly feel that he did something terrible to his wife. Part 2 is where it really takes off and the book is then hard to put down. You become shocked at how kniving his wife is and sad for him in giving up.
B001JNND9W|5.0|Blu-ray clarity is excellent for this 70's release.  Film is light on story, but still entertains as well, despite it's age.  Years have been kind to this piece and even for non-car nuts, this is a fun movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is amazing.  You will learn a great deal of what it takes to become a Seal and then learn even more about Seal Team 6 candidates.  The entire book was a great read and really informative regarding the process of a mission.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The Jack Reacher character always surprises me.  I can hardly wait for Child's next Reacher novel.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Its a must read, i could not put this book down once i started it.
1589944607|5.0|Bought this because my room mates and I loved the TV series. The board game is quite fun. The game is somewhat complicated at first and took about a full game for us to figure out the little nuances. It's one of those games where each character has its own advantages and disadvantages.<br /><br />Overall construction and materials used in the game were above average in my opinion. The cardboard was thick enough to keep anything from being easily damaged. The only part of the game set I was unimpressed with was the construction of the miniature plastic raiders and vipers. Some of them were bent and bowed, mainly the raiders.
B000063DGC|5.0|Purchased this album for a friend. He absolutely loves it. This was his favorite album and his last one got damaged so he couldn't play it.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|This is an awesome album full of emotions and great story telling. The production is solid and as always P!nk is on point with her vocals. Loved it
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Is this the best movie in existence EVER?  No...BUT it is pretty darned fun.  The movie includes a good amount of action, government conspiracy, technical aspects of sniping, etc.  I've seen this movie admittedly too many times, but that's only testament to its ability to capture your imagination.  I mean come on...a top military war hero is betrayed and must exact revenge.  That just shouts win to me.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This movie contains some action, some myth, some romance. It is a fast moving fairly tale with just the right touch to keep the viewer glued to the screen!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have played this game over and over...it is really fun and challenging and I recommend it to anyone, young and old!
B008K5T5AI|4.0|I've always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with Iain M. Banks's space opera. On the one hand, his aliens are relentlessly English, even the furry ones. On the other hand, he writes really well, and he explores grand ideas in non-trivial ways. Hydrogen Sonata is typical Iain M. Banks in both senses.<br /><br />One of the dustiest tropes in space opera is the extinct galactic supercivilization; a civilization that has done everything that can be done and has then departed, well, somewhere, leaving behind relics of awesome grandeur (not to mention peril) for lesser, newcomer civilizations to discover. Yet very few space operas tackle the obvious question head-on: what actually happens when a civilization has really done it all? What does it mean to the civilization in question, or those left behind?<br /><br />In Banks's Culture universe, the endpoint of civilizations has long been well known: they Sublime. That is, they leave the physical universe we live in - the Real - for some altogether better set of dimensions, known as the Sublime. Banks's galaxy has been littered with the detritus of such civilizations, either in the form of relics or, more rarely, in the form of remnants, sadly declined fragments who for one reason or another failed to Sublime when their peers did.<br /><br />Hydrogen Sonata explores the final days of one such galactic supercivilization. In form it's a typical Iain M. Banks space thriller, with intrigues, aliens, AI's, space battles, and a healthy sprinkling of sex and violence - although thankfully not quite as much violence as in Surface Detail, where it got a bit too thick for my taste. It's also seriously well written and well paced, and answers most of those really thorny questions the genre usually sweeps under the rug in ultimately pretty satisfying ways.<br /><br />While I didn't find Hydrogen Sonata quite as good as Banks at his best - that would be Use of Weapons - it was still very, very good, assuming you're the kind of forever young person who likes spaceships and forcefields and intelligent robots and world-spanning architecture. Plus it's very pleasant to read scifi that isn't utterly bleak and hopeless. A utopia the Gzilt civilization isn't (quite) even if the Sublime is nirvana, but I'd go live there in a heartbeat. I'm looking forward to whatever he has stewing next.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I wish I had a nickel for every time I have played this game! It is challenging and pretty addictive for this old woman!!!! Only trouble I have is, I play it every day and let my housework go! Also, I have to charge my KindleFire every night! Highly recommend this one!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously? How is this even remotely like real life??? I read it because it was receiving so many reviews and  i hesitate ( with reason) to use the word \\"rave\\" reviews but I didn't like it...at all... :P!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a literary masterpiece. It teaches you to not be passive when going through life, but to embrace all the good and bad that life can provide.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Wow! What a story! Waiting a whole year will be torture! More books sooner! Please! I guess I will hvae to wait....
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The book was a real page-turner.  Certainly it was a fun fantasy not to be taken seriously.  It was also a wonderful well-written romance.  There was really no hidden agenda I could detect, although one could make a case for non-discrimination or equality.  All I know is that I really enjoyed it, and it was an easy, fast read.  I'm glad I bought it.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Another great book from Grisham.  Great for teenage readers and not bad for an adult needing a John Grisham fix!
B008JH5HCW|4.0|It was better than the critics said, over all glad I did not pay $12.00 to see it in the movie theater but is worth 5 $ to buy.
B000V6MQV4|4.0|I really enjoy this CD, it has some songs I knew, and some I had never heard.  I'm very pleased that I like them all!
184195392X|4.0|This book would have been even better without the love story (arguably stories). I enjoyed Picoult's narration (as usual) especially given that this novel was divided up differently than her usual style of character-per-chapter. The emotions seem real and raw and the way she ties the past to the present is far-fetched yet completely believable. Most of all, parts of this story stay with you but don't make you afraid to go to sleep at night. It was delicately handled while taking on some hefty subjects. Some of the characters were a little flat and there were too many introductions to them in a row (\\"So and So was such and such. Paragraph. So and so was such and such.\\") Overall, it's still one of her good ones and will spark spirited debate about eugenics and ghosts.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Apart from a few songs sounding just so so quiet, especially in the car, I love this album. Also get the sound we own the sky. You can check out the cool video on youtube.
0439023513|2.0|To me, Mockingjay did not live up to Hunger Games or Catching Fire.<br /><br />One disturbing factor of this series and, in particular, this specific book is the sheer gore that Collins sheds so freely. When comparing the last book of Harry Potter and the last book of The Hunger Games, it becomes abundantly clear to me that there is no need for the imagery and language which Collins uses to describe the terrible scenes of war. It is overkill. Did we not all mourn and feel the full impact of loss and violence in the last Harry Potter without the need of graphic detail? Part of this is that Harry had wizardry and Katniss has arrows and guns, but it truly seems like Collins is determined to give her readers PTSD in this last book. I have problems when books are labeled as \\"young adult\\" novels, yet if they were transcribed exactly into a screenplay the movie would undeniably be given a hefty \\"R\\" rating.<br /><br />This book also feels rushed and shallow compared to the rest of the series. Far too many new characters are introduced without any depth added, and the ending is abrupt and anti-climatic.<br /><br />It is uncharacteristic of Gale to have left Katniss, and for Haymitch to fizzle out of their lives as well. Snow's life is snuffed out so quietly it barely makes sense and enough allusions to Cinna are made during the book to make the audience think he is possibly alive, yet Katniss never grieves him intensely enough for us to realize he's truly dead. Above all, the epilogue of Peeta and Katniss having kids is sadly uncharacteristic of Katniss and completely unnecessary to the end of the series, though the closing line is good.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the plot choices in this third novel, but glad I finished the series (and glad she ended up with Peeta).
1400069289|4.0|Each chapter builds on previous one's insights into how and why habits are created and how we can change negative, destructive habits into positive, enhancing ones.  Also helps understand why habits develop.  Enjoyed learning the \\"habits\\" created by clever marketing.
0743496736|5.0|This is one of the grittiest (if not THE grittiest) books she has written with one of the biggest shock-endings! I couldn't tear myself away even though it has the potential of giving you nightmares or making you paranoid. It's hard to describe this book other than saying you should read it- one of Picoult's absolute best.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|I liked this book, because it had a lot of unexpected twists and turns in it. Even though it's the third book in the series Martin manages to keep it entertaining and I just love how you can completely loose yourself in his imaginary world of the Seven Kingdoms. I also like how well he portraits the \\"badies\\" and how they can change over time, giving good and bad many facets.
0345803485|3.0|E.L. James sets her \\"romance\\" novel in Washington state but has a hard time hiding the fact that she is from London. We don't use \\"holy hell,\\" \\"bloody,\\" or \\"fetch\\" in America, yet her characters apparently do and they are incessantly drinking tea. A few other words are overused which have the slightly off sound of someone who is not American (i.e. \\"envisaged\\" instead of \\"envisioned\\", \\"pinioned\\" instead of \\"pinned\\", and \\"sardonically\\" instead of \\"sarcastically.\\")After finishing all 500-some pages, I never want to hear the words \\"there\\" to refer to a vagina, \\"wow,\\" \\"oh...\\" \\"holy crap\\" or \\"holy shit.\\" Anastasia's high GPA is mentioned several times throughout the story and yet these are the most eloquent of her thoughts? Nearly every single page has one of the above. The same exact description of Christian's smell gets old as do Anastasia's muscles flexing \\"deeply in her belly\\", \\"my sex\\" (also her vagina), hitching breath, and wayward thoughts. These are the new \\"heaving bosoms\\" I suppose. E.L. James accomplishes hot sex scenes while employing word choice that is below some mass paperback romance novels I have read. It's not that any of the aforementioned shouldn't be used, but it should be much more varied so it doesn't seem like you're writing the same paragraph over and over.<br /><br />She also didn't make it realistic enough. Once Christian and Ana switch to not using condoms she doesn't describe the post-coital differences. 27 year old men do not orgasm every 30 minutes, no man does unless he's on some serious drugs or whatnot. Get aroused, yes- orgasm, no. Fewer than 30% of women can orgasm through intercourse and only about 5-10% of women can orgasm solely from nipple/breast manipulation. At 21/22, Anastasia would not be so COMPLETELY virginal- no sex, no oral sex, no masturbation, only 2 kisses, and no dreams even about sex- HIGHLY unlikely. After four years of being roomies and best friends Kate would have opened up about her sex life long ago given her nature and realistic circumstances of their relationship.<br /><br />What James DID get right is the conflict of Anastasia's emotions over wanting more from Christian and exploring his inability to have a normal physical relationship even given his past (doesn't like to be touched, etc.) Often when men are hiding secrets that impact them that deeply and affect their physical relationships they will put up unusual boundaries (specific way to hold hands, not wanting to kiss with tongue or even have vaginal or missionary sex because it all denotes intimacy and love.) It's well summed up on the bottom of p.354-55, \\"What do I say? Because I think I love you, and you just see me as a toy. Because I can't touch you, because I'm too frightened to show you any affection in case you flinch or tell me off...\\"<br /><br />50 Shades of Grey definitely sets women's literature and rights back by years by playing up horrible stereotypes (she's in love because it's her first sexual encounter, she's insecure about her body even though the author defines no faults, she thinks she can change him, oh and she lets him control her in a sub/dom way...that too), but it was a swift read if nothing else. I'd be curious where James takes her characters in the follow up novels- I just hope her diction improves.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When I tired using this app I typed in what I wanted to see and the written words of what I was looking for stayed on the screen. It never went to youtube at all. I played around with it for like 20 mins before giving up and going on the web to youtube that way.
0525478817|5.0|I LOVED this book. As a two-time survivor of leukemia and someone who has many friends with varying illnesses (some of whom have the same diagnosis/medical issues as the two main characters), it was the only book I've read that made me feel as though I was reliving that part of my life. It's combination of humor, disability community, sorrow, and the inclusion of romance, dreaming, etc. was flawless. The ONLY thing I didn't appreciate was that every time the word \\"leukemia\\" was mentioned it was associated with \\"death\\" (there's an 85% survival rate, people). Other than that, Green did an impressive job of capturing 1) the sick, 2) female, 3) teenager. I know I will re-read this book numerous times and feel that everyone should give it a shot!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found it too long and drawn out.  Got very tired of it because of this.  Not my cup of tea.
0439023521|4.0|The rating should actually be 3.5 stars. Hunger Games is one of the few books that I actually enjoyed less than the movie.<br /><br />Collins definitely has her own style of writing which includes clipped sentences, a fast-paced plot, and first person perspective (this surprised me, for some reason I expected third). She does a good job of conveying Katniss's confusion regarding Peeta/Gale, yet I refuse the notion that she finds her love and ability to marry useless simply because she does not want to produce children.<br /><br />Collins incorporates nuggets of information along the way in the book instead of having 1-2 characters give long monologues about the situation and I appreciated this both in the book and the film, which captured Hunger Games so well while making choices that streamline the most important elements of the novel. Collins has created one of the most original and compelling premises I've seen though, so much credit should be given! I look forward to reading books 2 and 3.
0446547646|2.0|I have every Nicholas Sparks book, and I greatly enjoy his writing and characters, but this book didn't appeal to me.  The details at the end are a little too far fetched for me, plus it tied up so \\"neatly\\" that it seemed not to be realistic or conceivable as something that actually could happen in the real world.  I don't mind if he has this blend of books, some that end happily and some that end sadly.  This one DOES end sadly, but it's not for that reason that I'm saying I don't like it.  I've liked other books that have ended sadly that he has written.  The love story between the characters I didn't care for, relate to, or root for (given the circumstances of the female character's life at that point) and honestly neither character really drew me into the story.  I loved The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, The Guardian, The Lucky One, The Rescue, and Safe Haven.  I also greatly enjoyed reading the memoir he wrote with his brother; their family's story is fascinating.  This particular book just lacked a certain spark that his other books have had.  I do love that all his books are set in North Carolina, my home state, and I usually enjoy the plot and the romance between the characters, but this book seemed a bit overly long and also didn't draw me in.  I was surprised by my not liking it since I typically enjoy his writing.
B0098VXCR0|3.0|My wife and I had high hopes for this film, but it sort of fell short (now I'm glad we weren't able to find time to see it in the theaters)<br /><br />The only actor of any caliber is Charlize Theron and it shows.  Kristin Stewart is wooden and Chris Hemsworth, while good in Thor, The Avengers, (and what little we saw him) and StarTrek does not pull it off here - he seems like he doesn't want to be here, like he's contractually obligated to act in the movie.<br /><br />The visuals and audio were great in HD and it wasn't a waste of time - it was entertaining - but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />In hindsight I'm not sure I would pay money to see it, but if it happened to come on cable TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon?  Sure.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|Other reviews have explained the plot in more detail than I will here.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's probably more my problem than the author's, is that I got the characters confused early in the book. Once I figured out who was who and who did what, everything was wonderful.<br /><br />I read this book and I felt like I wanted to go for a visit and see these old friends and sit down and chat with them. I quickly began to enjoy their foibles and quirks and wanted to get to know them more. It is the characters and the setting that make this book what it is, lovely.<br /><br />It is funny at times, sad at times, and overall enjoyable. I particularly liked that the characters showed courage under difficult times and bravery and yet they acted like anyone else.<br /><br />Completely worth the money.<br />Enjoy.

B000002GY9|5.0|This album has been on top of my favorites list since it first came out.  Tom Waits made the perfect album, an incredible mix of songs, from the truly chilling \\"Small Change\\" to the funny and unique \\"Step Right Up\\" and \\"Pasties and a G-String\\" to the sing along songs like \\"The Piano Has Been Drinking\\" and \\"I Can't Wait to Get Off Work\\".  Hey, just the cover photo is worth the purchase, but so is any individual song on the album.  You can't go wrong, it is classic, and if you are just discovering Tom Waits, this is a great place to start.

B0036S4C6G|4.0|It might have been a Tony Gilroy interview in The New Yorker where I first heard the thought that we, as mega consumers of television, books and movies, have seen and heard so many stories we can't find anything new under the sun.  As a result, storytellers have taken to teasing out stories, crafting narratives where crucial bits of the story get parsed out like flakes of gold.  Using this limited field of vision technique, authors refresh the old, making it new.<br /><br />Please bear that in mind as you read this review of \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad.\\"<br /><br />Egan sketches the lives of two central characters, a music industry executive - who is increasingly unhappy with the direction of the music business (aren't we all) and his longtime assistant - as they grow from complicated teens to adults with character flaws and later finally find some comfort in their lives.  Not an overly complicated story arc or even an original one when laid out end to end, but Egan doesn't let the narrative unfold from point A to point B, she starts in the middle skips back nearly a generation and closes a solid generation after the novel's opening line.<br /><br />In that disjointed time phase and the way minor characters slip into the storyline take on major storylines of their own and eventually fade away, \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" reminds me a lot of Quentin Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  It's as if Egan found a box of old photo albums picked a couple at random and craft stories about the people in the pictures.  You know, when you pick up the albums, you don't always do it in chronological order and the people in your life gain and diminish in importance, which can be seen by the frequency of their appearances in the photos.<br /><br />The book isn't for everyone, which can be seen by looking at the reviews and noting how many people loved or hated the book.  For some people, entering a chapter in the middle of the action (a technique common among film writers) and then trying to get your bearings is not just disconcerting, it's not worth the effort.  And frankly there are more than a few chapters where I found myself saying, \\"Okay, now who does this person know and where are they from?\\"  It's like getting to a party late, meeting a bunch of people and trying to figure out how they know the host.  I thought it was the trouble just for the audacity the technique itself.  Well that and I like to work a room during a party.<br /><br />I also appreciated how the stories are told in a series of interconnected thing that's that either illuminate a person's character or propel them to a different state.  If you go back across each of our lives, you can find moments, some big and some subtle, that tip our paths unalterably in a different direction.  Sometimes those moments are made of things that we did or didn't do, and other times we simply bear witness to an event that push us past the point of no return. Not all the moments in our lives are made equal.  Egan nails that.<br /><br />She also understands that we live in a small, small world.  Mentioning the butterfly effect is clichéd, but often the people who have the greatest impact on who we become have histories of their own that are unknown to us but make them who they are.  Egan sketches out those hidden connections.<br /><br />Finally, despite displaying an encyclopedic mind that hints at a past career as a college DJ, Egan never references Elvis Costello, a singer/songwriter famous for his wordplay (but who only late in his career put lyrics on his albums), wrote the song Goon Squad back in the late seventies.  But I digress and date myself.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I am really enjoying this album. The songs put me in a good mood. They kind of remind me of early Killers or if Snow Patrol were peppier. I still love all the songs, after repeated listenings, my favorite songs are probably Demons and On Top of the World and maybe Bleeding Out. It's hard to pick a favorite. They are nothing like Mumford and Sons, but the way I love the whole album is the same way I felt about Mumford's first album.
B007HO392S|5.0|I first heard the song on the radio, then I saw the video, this is by far the best that Carrie Underwood has done.  I love all the songs on the cd.  I've just about<br />worn it out playing it.  Keep it up Carrie, you are great.
B008S80P38|4.0|Deadmau5 returns with a new set of sound, demonstrating his capability to produce great music through creative ways. Because I know most of you won't read lengthy reviews, here are the top tracks:<br /><br />1) FN Pig = It's like Strobe meeting Wolfgang Gartner; combining the most epic build-up with an intense bass line that will dominate your sound system.<br /><br />2) Closer = Are you a frequent traveler to Europe? This song will remind you of all your trips to Europe, or just make you feel proud that he is using the PSA sound from train stations across Europe and turn it into some awesome dance-able tune.<br /><br />3)Maths = If you've never heard this song live, then you really missed out, but here is your opportunity to get a glimpse of Deadmau5's true technical capabilities. Circuit bending couldn't have been more destructive than this track and it makes House super dirty good!<br /><br />4) The Veldt = This is like the \\"I Remember\\" of this album; soft, soothing and makes you wish you can hold your loved one so tightly while the disco ball shines it ray of love all over the room.<br /><br />5) Sleepless = This is Deadmau5 doing Trip-Hop style music. I found this song very beautiful and delicate in the late hours of night. Super song to chill to, and definitely one of the best attempts by Deadmau5<br /><br />6) Superliminal = This is the \\"FML\\" of the album. Straight-up intense House, repetitive and worthwhile to listen to if you are in a long roadtrip to Swaziland.<br /><br />7) There might be Coffee = This is Deadmau5's take on Madeon; the song is very French-Electro (i.e. Funk) and I think it's just an experiment by Deadmau5 to prove that he is capable of anything.<br /><br />8) Professional Griefers = This is like \\"A City in Florida\\", where the instrumental sounds much better than the lyrics. The lyrics reminds me of Big Bird taunting me with alphabets. And this fake British accent sucks massive...In essence, just listen to the instrumental, which is SO much more better than the lyrics version.<br /><br />9) Take care of proper Paperwork = This song is like a build-up. It has an amazing build-up, but hardly any drop. You'll be so disappointed by the fact it has no drop that you'll end up just remixing this song with something else.<br /><br />10) Channel 42 = This is literally Wolfgang Gartner and Deadmau5 doing a collab, but it wasn't that great. I mean, \\"Animal Rights\\" has more flavor and awesomeness to it rather than this. This is more leaning towards Wolfgang's \\"Undertaker\\" sound, where Deadmau5 just adds extra \\"pauses\\" in the song to demonstrate his keyboard playing skill or something.<br /><br />The one with Imogen and Cypress Hill were plain weird, and I don't think they deserve my time for a review.h more better than the lyrics version.<br /><br />9) Take care of proper Paperwork = This song is like a build-up.

0062206281|4.0|The Prisoner of Heaven brings back some of the same characters as in the first (2) books: The Shadow of the Wind and Angel's Game.  Interesting enough -- the second book, The Angel's Game, is actually a prequel to the series, but I digress.<br /><br />Barcelona - 1950s, Daniel Sempre (married with a young child) and his father Senor Semper are both back in this novel running Sempre and Sons bookstore, but business isn't very good.  In this novel the mysterious book in question is an extremely rare and valuable edition of The Count of Monte Cristo.  Fermin Romero de Torres is back as well, but this time secrets from his past have a way of catching up with him, and the reader is transported back to the 1940's to learn more.<br /><br />Dark and atmospheric, this novel is much shorter than the previous two, and although it kept me turning the pages, I didn't think it had the same level of suspense and mystery as the earlier books.<br /><br />Have you read this series? If not and are thinking about it, I would definitely read these in order.  It appears there will still be yet another installment to come.
B00364K6YW|4.0|One of my absolute favourite movies I must have seen this at least 30 times and it never gets old! The lake scene with Mr. Darcy alone is worth checking this version out for!!
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I am a fan of the Longmire Series.  So I've read a couple of the books.  \\"The Cold Dish\\" is an pretty good read, but not what I would term a great read.  Actually I enjoy the TV version more.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful! It is an absolute must-have! It tells me how many hours I have been on my kindle fire to how many things I have done. I love it!!!! &lt;3
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I stumbled on Ken Follett's work after seeing the mini series \\"Pillars of Earth\\" and have been hooked on his writing ever since.  This book has it all...sex, fighting, drama, intrigue, humor, politics...and it has you from the first page.  I recently re-read it before the second book came out, read the second book \\"Winter of the World\\" and now I'm waiting eagerly for the third in the series.  Its a fun, fast read that will leave you wanting more!
B008FSCNTK|2.0|Costello must have thought he'd hit the jackpot with Diane Krall, look at the doors that charlatan has been allowed to open. I loathe his mundane songwriting, his lyrics are truly cringworthy - Fender have even given him an endorsement for their famous Jazzmaster guitar - what the hell does he know about guitars? If Di continues in this direction (under his influence, I suspect)she'll find herself without a record deal and her brilliant band will fly the coup. She's too old to make in the pop biz,take pride in being a jazz musician before you lose all credibility.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved everything about this book. The chapters are short and keep you wanting to turn the page. The book makes you think about the concept of time and taking it for granted. I read the book in 2 days and couldn't put it down. Definitely recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|for the person who revewd almost perfect water mixes with lova to make the thing you need to make a nether portal (look up on youtube how to make)and that sends you to an alternet dimension and the wolf I'm pretty sure there used for fur as for the rest there used for food
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|[[ASIN:0143119680 A Discovery of Witches: A Novel (All Souls Trilogy)]]<br /><br />This is a good read, I have trouble putting it down! It's players are brought to life and it has unexpected twists and turns. I would recommend this read to all fiction readers!The nice thing is,I got it on Amazon so it was priced right!<br /><br />Avid reader
B000V6ACKG|4.0|I remember this album coming out when I was a kid. At the time \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"The Boy's are Back In Town\\" were the only songs I remember getting airplay.  There are quite a few good songs on this album other than the obvious two I already stated.  I highly recommend it.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Lots of info for that unfortunate day if it comes..... interesting read and enjoyed it.  makes you think what would u do in  some of those situations.
B001A3GSFW|4.0|The Ramones are Americas first garage rock band.  They were indie before there was indie.  They were at their peak when I was a kid and I had a couple of their albums.  As I got older I kind of drifted away always planing to tune back into them someday.  When I saw this offer and started playing some of the cuts it brought back alot of memories for me. Now to their music.  This is an important band that needs to be remembered. Their music holds up even more when compared with all of this auto-tuned pop biased drivel prevelent today.
B00992CF6W|4.0|how do I get out of creative mode otherwise its a really good game. help help help help help help
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Great read!..really keeps the reader guessing and on edge! The characters are easy to get into.  I would give this book as a gift!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book is full of surprises. I couldn't put it down, and kept turning each page wondering what was going to happen next!
1400069289|5.0|I thought this book was great! It really broke down why we do what we do--for good or for bad. I learned a lot that I'll use to help me alter some of my bad habits.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire series was one of the best I've read in a while. It's not just for teens or pre-teens. I'm 24 and enjoyed the series very much. Give it a try.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This is a great video if you like British humor.  If so, you'll love it.  I had seen the series on PBS and knew I'd like it.  You'd never guess that Wooster is Dr. House.  The Jeeves character is right out of the PG Wodhouse books.  Highly recommend.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I enjoyed this one as much as any of Lee Child's books. Many twists, many turns. Some repetitive things from other books, but overall, I give it a thumbs up. I can't wait for the next release in the series.
B00913DPW2|4.0|great game but it kinda sucked on my phone because it doesn't zoom in to find the pieces. other than that, all good.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I had seen many Castle episodes in the past. Some how the first season escaped me. Very funny! I enjoyed fhe badder side of castle. In the future episodes he is so in love he is just a big puppy dog.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is just addicting and fun to pass the time. My parents (70s) and my kids (13 and 16) all enjoy playing it.
0525953728|4.0|This book had great stories.  It became slightly difficult to keep up with at times as he bounced between stories, but otherwise a great book!  The Bin Laden raid was told in great detail and was a lot of fun to follow.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Lots of fun, and my two kiddies LOVE LOVE LOVE it. All the fun purchases available makes it especially enjoyable for the children.
B009LZEZSI|5.0|i really enjoyed watching the break up, it very sad and i loved the songs , i was sad for two days it really got to me, darren criss out did himself on teenage dream, you could feel his pain for what he did to kurt.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! Many plot twists...and end of chapter shockers.  I found myself changing who I was rooting for all the way to the end.  I was very disappointed in the ending, I expected a big bang of a finish and did not get one. Even still...loved the story!
B001BR5NH6|5.0|I love this movie..the quality was very good and the download only took a few minutes.<br />I would definitely rent this way again
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This book is great and I think   it is the best book in the series. I recommend this for ages middle schoolers.

B0098VYKSA|3.0|Somewhat clunky but fun fantasy in the theme of snow white.  I had no idea there were so many Snow white stories variations out there
0316228532|4.0|It was never a question of whether or not I would read J.K. Rowling's first novel since the Harry Potter series, and her first book for adults. Obviously I would read it. I've been a huge fan of Rowling's writing and storytelling for well over a decade, reading and re-reading the Harry Potter books more often than I have any other book (let alone series of books). She's been a big part of my reading life for years. Obviously I would read anything she writes. As some reviewers have said, she's \\"review-proof.\\" I, like so many others, would read her work no matter what. The question is, could I write an honest review?<br /><br />Well...<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is not a book you can (or should) compare to Rowling's other work. It has nothing to do with Harry Potter, in subject matter or in tone. If anything, it's sort of a glimpse into the inner life of the Dursleys, but even that's a stretch. It's a book about class struggles and politics in rural England centred around the election of a new member of the Parish Council. I expected it to be funny, even in a dry British kind of way (I'm assuming I don't need to explain what I mean by that). About half-way through I thought maybe it was meant to be more sad or at least poignant and revealing of the human condition. The thing is...<br /><br />Okay, I have to pause here to distance myself from what I'm about to say. I'm having a hard time admitting that I didn't love the book written by the author whose other books I obsessively loved. And it's not even that I didn't love it as much as Harry Potter, or that it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, or that it was different from what I expected. It wasn't just a question of too-high expectations. And it's not like I hated this book. It's just...<br /><br />It was okay.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B005XQ973M|3.0|Chang's text makes an important contribution to the study of the Sino-Japanese conflict of 1937-1945. Whilst this is not the place for analysing (or contributing to) the greater historical, sociocultural or political debates on the topic, I do believe that this is an important text for anyone interested in enhancing their understanding of the conflict, not least as Chang uses the final chapters to open up discussion of the continuing impact of both the war and the relative lack of knowledge that has defined events such as the Nanjing invasion.<br /><br />This was the first time that I opted to purchase an historical text in Kindle format and I was slightly disappointed with the lack of inclusions. I have worked with this text in the past in hard copy and whilst they are extremely unpleasant, the images are, in my opinion, a vital addition. One of my primary motivations for getting a Kindle was to be able to minimise the number of books I need to cart along to university. However, without all features of the hard copy, I was disappointed with Kindle format. Therefore, the rating I give the text is not primarily for the book itself but for the format in which I purchased it.
184195392X|3.0|Are you excited about the upcoming movie version of Life of Pi? I admit that the trailer looks gorgeous (scroll down to watch it) although for some reason I was sure the movie had been made years ago, shortly after the book came out. I guess it goes to show how little I keep up to date with movie releases these days. Nonetheless, I'm pretty excited about this one. I've read the book and listened to the audiobook and I liked them both (liked, but didn't love) but I think the real power of this story could be in the visual representation that a movie allows. To see that tiger, to hear it roar, it's pretty powerful stuff. What do you think? Will you be going to see Ang Lee's interpretation of Yann Martel's novel?<br /><br />My original review:<br /><br />I liked--but did not love--the book. I do feel like the entire story was a maddeningly elaborate set up for the final chapter, kind of like that joke, \\"The Aristocrats.\\" But the pay off was good. The audio book was only okay, though. I really hated the narrator and his unwarranted belief in his own ability to pull of realistic accents.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I recently received a digital galley of this book free from the publisher from NetGalley (probably as a tie-in with the upcoming movie), though I already own the paperback version and have listened to the audiobook. I was not obliged to write a favourable review, or even any review at all. The opinions expressed are strictly my own.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|I needed a light small case to carry my Nikon d5100 in, and this is perfect, it's small, light, has plenty of extra pockets, I'm not sure if you can fit a lens in the side pockets but I have read that it is possible, I haven't tested it yet, I can however fit my backup camera a Samsung PL-120 while in it's own Samsung case in the side pocket, I am also able to fit my Nikon lens pen and remote and sd cards in the pocket in the top flap, so it's very convenient and compact.<br /><br />This case is well made, it feels and looks good, the strap that you get with it does leave something to be desired, it's just a simple adjustable strap, very thin and semi-uncomfortable, but you can replace that easily. There is also a loop on the back of this bag so a belt or strap for hip wear can be looped through it. I am happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend it for a backup bag or even a travel bag.<br /><br />The only CON I see is the little thing strap that comes with it. But for the price this is a great value.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and addicting puzzle game. Is a but easy, but I am currently on the first puzzle set so far...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is really good its not a type of book I usely read.  This book tells about the life of a Navy Seal in Seal Team 6.  It talks about how some missions are carried out and how they train and live what they do.  The person who wrote this book was on the team that kill Osama.  It tells how they train long and hard for this mission and other missions  and why he joined the Navy.  He goes through his account of the attack and what part he took in it.  The author changes all the names and took all materials that he could not talk about out of the book.  Overall this is a really good book. I would recommend this to anyone.  Its an easy book to read, and you will enjoy it when you do.  This book also makes you think what these people go thur who are in the miltary, police, or fire.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I may have been slightly disappointed with the end of Bared to You but Sylvia Day did NOT disappoint in Reflected in You. The tumultuous story of Eva and Gideon picks up right where it left off but we're still no closer to finding out what's behind Gideon's troubled soul...at least not until much later in the book. I was riveted to this book, not being able to really put it down until I had finished.<br /><br />Throughout the book my heart was aching for Eva and what she was going through with Gideon. Eva thought she had found her soul mate but Gideon kept proving her wrong. How could you not feel for a troubled woman who just wanted to find true happiness. Gideon did win me over briefly but that period was short lived until...<br /><br />If there's a continuation to their story, I can't wait to read it. Surely they can only go up from here.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|The Uglies series is a really great series.  This series deals with some body image, friends. and how life would be in a world different than  today.  In the first book, the time is set 200 or 300 years into the future where when a person become 16 they get turn pretty.  They are turn pretty by an operation that changes their body into what it is suppposed to look like by doctors.  Tally Youngblood is the 15 year old girl who all her life wants to become pretty and live in New Pretty Town.  Tally's world changes forever after she turn 16.  She meets a lot of pepple on the way but she finds out she must not become pretty, but she has to so she can help fix what is wrong with her and everybody else.  This is a great book.  This series makes people think just because you may hate something about your body its still beautiful the way it is.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Loved the book, it was hard to put down like all of Lee Child's books. I can't wait for the next one!
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is awesome I really like it I hope everybody get it. in other hand it works perfect with my kindle fire.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|It seems really silly to play, but after playing it for a while, I've gotten really addicted. Plus, I don't feel so bad playing the game because it helps me do my addition, when I haven't really used my own head to do that for a while.
B009KHCLIS|5.0|love this show! i never want them to stop making more seasons this is one of the few shows that actually relates to me. and makes me laugh. i hope they never stop making more episodes!
B008GFI4KY|5.0|As good as Permission to Land was, Hot Cakes is even better. Forget the awful cover picture, it's the music that matters, and on this one the Hawkins Bros. and company deliver. From the party anthem, \\"Everybody have a Good Time\\" to rockers like \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" and \\"Every Inch of You\\", to the ballad \\"Living Each Day Blind\\" or their amazing hard rock cover of Radiohead's \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\", this is a comeback album not to be missed, there is not a single moment of filler on the album. I saw these guys live in Nashville back in May, and they rock harder than ever, catch them on tour when they return to the States next year.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|best game ever ever ever ever. play it every day for hours. five stars for this game for sure. no matter wat
B009CPES4I|5.0|This is a warm, wonderful movie that can be enjoyed by all ages.  It's a treat to see a film so well written and acted - truly a pleasure to watch.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was skeptical when I heard the premise, but when it came up for so many emmy-nominations I decided I needed to get caught up. Both characters are intriguing without the over dramatization that insults the intelligence like so many shows these days.  I watched all of the episodes back to back have to say that there were bittersweet, love him, hate him, love her, blown away moments along the way.  Will have to get a hold of Showtime somehow to keep up this season
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|A young woman with a serious lack of self worth, navigates her way through her coming of age relationships, by pushing those around her further away only to realise that it is not them that deem her not worthy but herself. How does her past, impact her relations in the present and has she damaged them too much to accept and receive love?
B008O9V24W|5.0|I was so excited for this album to come out and I was not disappointed at all. I think it still has a lot of energy and chilling emotions. I think that the band has grown and become more concise and uniform.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i have at one time had 5 different bible Apps on my device aftet carefully exploring each one You Version is the best there is. You offers more versions of the bible and more versions with audio which is the best feature a bible App can have. &quot;You&quot; allows for<br />notes, highlighting, posting on Social networks, it give Badges which for me is great!!  I love reading the Word yet I do admit there are times I want to skip my reading, but the Badges encourage &amp; inspire me to stick with it. You bible also has reminders and several plans that will fit any seekers life style there is something for everyone in this App.
034580404X|5.0|Those books are really good, far away from good. I love the story, the sex explicit combination of pain and pleasure is amazing, is not another porn novel, is much more than that; it's make me realize the fragile line between the pain  and pleasure and explore the limits of the sexuality and that is not such as wrong to explore it.<br /><br />THANK to E L James, thanks Christian Grey!!!
076790592X|2.0|For ALBOM, this was a tragic experience.  But, was<br />it a book???  Well, I don't think so.  Luckily, it only took<br />a couple of hours to read.  I really got zippo from reading<br />it.  Again, the rating system is lacking some leeway.  This<br />book is not a two, but, it is not a one either.  There are no<br />half-stars!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book, the story had a lot of twists in it so it kept you interested and unsure of the ending.
B008M9PHWM|3.0|Very good album. Not Time out of Mind, but way better than Together Through Life.<br /><br />Love to see him work with Lanois again or Rick Rubin.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I have a Samsung Stratosphere and downloaded PicShop on the free app of the day. It is useful and seems to work with very few problems. I really like having a decent photo editor on my phone and not having to worry about getting back to the computer.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I used to like this headset.  Hardware-wise, it was solid. Still is, although the charging port was a little too prone to breaking. But with the most recent software updates, the &#34;eh, it's a bit quirky&#34; aspects have moved entirely into actively refusing to provide the advertised functionality.  Logitech will not be getting another penny from me until this is fixed. Hell, at this point, I might not even bother buying stuff from them AFTER they fix it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very good book, it kept my interest all the way until the end. Highly recommended if you like complex personality and studying human behavior.

B00003CXTG|5.0|We had bought this 2-disc set in Portland before we moved to Denver. To our dismay when we opened and played it in our new home, the second disk was faulty and wouldn't run. We were 1300 miles from the store we bought it -- so we ordered another copy through Amazon. It was competitively priced, new, and quickly delivered. We sat down and watched the second part, thoroughly satisfied!<br />(What's that? Did we check to see that the new set's disk #1 worked? You betcha'! It's perfect.)
B003B02O7I|5.0|great book  love this authors work. I believe i could read all his books, great writer. I would recommend reading.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Everything about this game is fantastic.  You can play forever but if you want to do a different game or advance, prepare to pay real money.
0425166805|5.0|I absolutely loved Chariots of The Gods...every second reading it was interesting. Anyone who wants to open their mind to new and different perspectives HAVE to read this book.

B004WR125O|1.0|This product is totally unreliable--some days I am totally unable to connect to  internet radio; other days I'll make a connection to a streaming station but after awhile the connection is interrupted; only occasionally do I have a trouble free listening connection.<br /><br />I have the Onkyo TX 8050 receiver, and it's a fine receiver but the internet radio feature using UWF-1 is a disaster. I've been complaining to Onkyo ever since I first set it up. Their tech support service has been good in so far as I always get a live person on the phone quickly, but can't solve the problem.  First they sent me a replacement UWF-1, but it didn't help.  Then I spent an hour on the phone with tech support and they walked me through the complete setup and trouble shooting routine, including downloading and installing their July 2012 firmware update, but again no change no performance.  The only thing that seems definite is that the unit keeps dropping its proper IP address.<br /><br />All of my other wireless connections work fine: to a Vizio TV, the Dell PC, an iPad, and a standalone internet radio that I had purchased previously from CC Crane.  All of these work just fine on my wireless (Netgear) setup, including the Crane internet radio.<br /><br />I'm thinking of trying the TP Link unit (that a number of people have reported on in the support formums) in place of the UWF-1; otherwise I think I will operate the CC Crane radio through the TX 8050 receiver (so that it will play through the speakers connected to the TX 8050) as otherwise it's in a different room where I don't use it often.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Its okay definately not the best I've read. Story line is okay not sure about the writing style though. Thats all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this collection.  A human look at how we relate to each other.  The ending of each book had me going \\"I can't believe the author just did that!\\"  I'm reading \\"I Zombie\\" now and waiting for the the next \\"Wool\\".  Great job Mr. Howey.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Effects are very interesting but story development and acting are off.  I just never got the sense that Snow White was a person of character that justified everyone's devotion.
B005FISBTO|3.0|As the previous reviewer stated, I was also able to scan through the previews on this sixth season dvd set but the video quality is substandard and fuzzy.  Ive had problems with the picture locking up, skipping, and I cant get the third disc to play at all!  Its not my player as it works fine with other discs, Im just so frustrated with this set?<br /><br />As for the program, Im also a bit let down with this season.  Seems that with the \\"Nebraska\\" show, the writers were just throwing out material to fill up empty space.  It seems the whole season lacks the quality Ive gotten used to with \\"Dexter\\" up to now.  Im half way finished with it so far, not even sure if I will attempt to finish it with the trouble Im having with the poor quality discs...

0525478817|1.0|This is the first time I have bothered to write a review.  I bought this book based on the very high rating but I could not be more disappointed.  I do admit that I didn't finish the book because I couldn't stand it anymore.  The sarcastic comments by the characters is so annoying.  I only hope some other people like me can bring down the rating from 5 stars.
0307950689|5.0|Good weekend reading, very enjoyable.  It was as if I took a trip to Washington, D. C.  Seeing and finding out about history at the same time as a case is being solved.  The decision making strategies used by the characters required continual thought analysis, some even to the point of reflection, WHY?  But then the author brought the results to a THAT'S WHY conclusion, throughout the book.  When is the movie being released?

B00992CF6W|5.0|if you were too stupid to read the title then READ IT. this game is the best ive known compared to the xbox. all the rest that you may compare to this is nothing ... I played this other game ( I forgot what it was called) and it was fun but it was only a little like minecraft and there were different spawners for different animals which I thought was pretty stupid... but then it would crash all of a sudden. like you would be building your house or fighting a dragon (which I was doing the first time it crashed) and it will close it and crash! but I know you don't want to here me talking about some other game and you want me to tell you about minecraft but it was something to compare anyway... but minecraft is epic. but wat I DONT like about it is that you can go to the nether because you cant make obsidian ( sorry if I slept it wrong) and the only thing you can do with flint and steal is blow up TNT. but this is my opinion so if you didn't like what I had to say then you shouldn't have read this TO BEGIN WITH! PeAcE OuT!<br /> ()  ()<br />( o.o )<br />( )  ( )  BUNNY!

B000F90312|5.0|After Jane Campion's \\"The Piano\\" astonished me with its moving story, which seemed closer to a timeless fable than a corset drama set in 1855, its gorgeous landscape, and its incredible characters, I had to get a copy of Michael Nyman's soundtrack.<br /><br />To start with, I am outraged that the composer never got an Oscar for his work and especially for that movie. Indeed, he managed to create not only an incredible music, but also a second language to Ada, Holly Hunter's character, as she expresses through her piano her emotions and feelings to the other characters and viewers. For as she is mute, Ada's piano becomes her body, soul, and voice. And with the orchestral soundtrack played during the movie, this gives to the story a musical success that people haven't forgotten.<br /><br />According to the leaflet in the album, we get to hear in the soundtrack Michael Nyman play the piano while conducting members of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, and a team of wind-instrument musicians such as John Harle, Andrew Findon and David Roach playing instruments such as Saxophone and Flute. Alongside it, Michael Nyman get to write about his creative intentions, along with a nice theory as to how Ada might have invented her music.<br /><br />Of the tracks that I liked, I adored so much all of them that I have difficulty in finding out which ones are my favorites. But if I were to keep five tracks of them in my soul, it would be \\"To the edge of the Earth\\", \\"Big My Secret\\", \\"The Heart asks Pleasure First\\", \\"The Embrace\\" and \\"All Imperfect Things\\".<br /><br />As a last note to anybody who loved this album, I am glad that Michael Nyman released and made a Concerto out of the Piano soundtrack. It was a good way for him to compile and unite together some of the tracks and create an excellent concerto which he recorded in 1997 with the Ulster Orchestra. Another way for him to immortalize his wonderful soundtrack.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I liked the book when I first started it, then all the journal entries became boring and almost identical.  It picked up at the end and I couldn't put it down.  But most of the book was boring and it took forever for me to will myself to finish it.  If it wasn't so long it would have been a little better but way too repetative.
0385483821|5.0|The journey of Intel's IC progress was a great story. It truly helps me understand how to be an effective leader and also how to identify good strategy for the company. This book also explores Porter's 5 forces further by including one more force in addition to developing strategic inflection point based on this particular concept. I suggested reading \\"What is Strategy\\" by Michael Porter too.

Its a really helpful book with lots of cartoon animation, as you might expect, but if you're just looking to buy it for cartoon drawing then its also a great book as it will help with drawing perspective and general construction of a character. Highly recommended.
B003LXSY60|4.0|I had never heard of The Black Keys before I bought this album but it made me a devoted fan. Great beginner album to ease you into this amazing band. Have recommended this to at least 10 people already. Consider yourself the 11th!

B00846REIS|4.0|People have compared this book to \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" but I do not think they are the same--just a few parallels.  I really enjoyed the characters and this first book is primarily introducing all of the characters and getting to know them.  The follow-up story in Sylvia Day's second book is even better and the story develops more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Now I am excited to read the next two of this awesome trilogy. Now I finally see what all of the buzz was about! WOW
0316228532|4.0|Many people dislike this book but i don't think its because they are judging the book against the Harry Potter phenomena and not this book alone.<br /><br />The book wasn't really marketed so the people who area reading this book are mostly harry potter fans. however this book would not appeal to most harry potter fans.<br /><br />On its own it is a great book. Its very raw and JK Rowling really doesn't hide anything about the real world through a rosy window.<br /><br />the writing is amazing, very descriptive.<br /><br />the characters are brilliant - very real - you hate every character yet you see this sliver of good in them all. You also see a bit of yourself in the characters.<br /><br />So overall a great book. However read it if you like dramas, politics, amazing characterization and less plot focused. Not for a fan of fantasy only.<br /><br />Most definitely not for young children.<br /><br />Definitely an adult/you adult/older (mature) teenager book.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I hate leaving a one-star rating for anything by JK Rowling - especially a book I was so excited about reading, but after, literally, forcing myself to finish this book, I can't give it anything more than one-star.  The book was long, very boring and I spent most of the book waiting for something to really happen.  But, the ending seemed very abrupt and incredibly depressing.  I certainly hope this isn't the kind of book that she'll feel the need to write more of.  How very disappointing !!  Its not very often I feel \\"sorry\\" about reading a book, but this is definitely one of them.
B008XG1X18|1.0|i have a difficult time loading this app. i deleted and reloaded but it continues to not respond and do a force close on my Kindle fire.
B003B02PEU|4.0|This novel was much more character driven than plot driven than other Grisham novels I've read.  I enjoyed the first person narrative and the way the characters became real.  This wasn't the kind of book that so gripped me so that I had to rush to read it in one setting, but instead one that I was able to take more time to savor and enjoy the nuances of some of the southern flavors and smells.  Enjoyable book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love all the ideas for cooking and kids and crafts.. there are endless possibilitys in what you can do. I spend hours pinning and we have party's where we all make a special recipe ...ive even tried the hair styles...I LOVE IT!!!!!

B004EI3ON4|5.0|Really like the music that Daft Punk put together for this movie.  They did a great job and the music really sets the mood right in this album.  Liked this better then the reconfigured version.
B0078XFYDA|3.0|The best part of this book is the different myths and legends (used to explain why things happen in this world) that Dawkin's introduces to the reader.  <br /><br />This book is five star for young readers for it will challenge the way they look at the world.  For someone with a more general education in science and liberal arts the book is too basic but still well written enough to make it worth reading when one is not in the mood to tackle on more complicated concepts and theories like string theory or mitochondrial DNA.<br /><br />The tone is slightly anti-religious so that may be off putting for some readers.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|The songs on this are pretty good but I have to say I like the original by Daft Punk better.  Some of the remixes are good and some are not.  The music in this album is kinda hit and miss.  Wish some of the remixes could have been better because Daft Punk did a really good job with the original soundtrack.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|This book wasn't nearly as well written as the first in the series; it seems to have been thrown together in a hurry by a group of hired writers following Follett's directions. The first half was dull and uninteresting, as the writer(s) built his (their) characters. It only took off about half way through when the historial descriptions began. I learned a lot about the forces at play during WWII, and the misery suffered by everyone, Allies and Germans alike. It is a good \\"street-view\\" of life in Berlin, showing the brutality of the Nazis, the indiscriminate bombing of civilians by the British, and the bestial behavior of the \\"liberating\\" Russians. For me, it emphasized afresh just how painful, stupid, and pointless are humanity's violent struggles in name of one dogma or another. For its historical descriptions, the book deserves praise. It does less well in its hurried writing.
B000002LCB|5.0|This album was used in our school's homecoming court during halftime.  Part of it was played as the nominees and their escorts walked out onto the field.  It went over quite well.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

B007SUW24W|5.0|I had heard \\"The A-Team\\" on the radio a few times and this was one of those matches - you hear a song and just KNOW you're going to like this artist. It's how I first fell in love with the music of Jason Mraz, Sara Bareilles, Ben Folds, etc. Ed Sheeran joins their ranks.<br /><br />This is a great CD from start to finish. The songs seem subtle, but they are far more complex with each lesson. Sheeran is a great lyricist and you can really feel the emotions from within. And he almost raps on some of them, in a Mraz-like wordplay that is easy to appreciate, if a bit hard to sing along to (though the CD insert contains lyrics - a nice plus!).<br /><br />Highlights:<br />\\"Drunk\\" is a fun little song that is a catchy tune to sing along to.<br /><br />\\"U.N.I.\\" is awesome, showcasing his quick tongue and genius lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Small Bump\\" - What to say here. I didn't appreciate this until really listening. It's a poignantly beautiful song about a baby... it's gorgeous.<br /><br />\\"Lego House\\" and \\"This City\\" are gorgeous. \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\\" is a cool song for an ex.<br /><br />All in all: I bought this album days after buying \\"Babel\\" by Mumford & Sons. I put \\"+\\" in the car CD player... and \\"Babel\\" has been sitting in the passenger seat ever since.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|It's odd reviewing this now, as I have already reviewed the next two in the trilogy.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and read through it in a couple of days. The writing is straightforward without being overly simplistic and the characters are generally quite engaging.<br /><br />At times it takes on a a documentary feel, as if the main character is explaining things a little too much- info dumping? -but apart from that my only other issue would be the failure to create empathy.  I didn't care when a lot of people were killed, maybe that has something to do with the 'changes' the enlisted go through when they join. It just seemed as though the writing lacked, not for want of trying, emotion.<br /><br />Overall a good read.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Snow White and the Huntsman, while entertaining the acting was sub par. If it wasn't for the special effects this movie would have been a total bomb. The actress that played snow white does not carry the character very well. IN contrast the actress that plays the Queen does a very good job of making her character come to life. The Huntsman was well played and the supporting roles weren't bad. This movie is one to watch if you have nothing better else to do.

1451627289|3.0|My first complete read through with a Stephen King novel, and as they say in Spain: mas o menos. I do give high marks to King's flourishing prose, however, that was stellar in the laborious duty of hauling around a historically complex, philosophically profound, and (unfortunately) hackneyed plot.<br />Time travel is to sci-fi what puppy-love romances are to fairy tales; King should steer clear of both. His shtick is horror; he practically invented the genre, for God sake.<br />But from King's middle-age, bordering on elderly, stage in his life, no one, I suppose, can blame him for veering into ruminations of historical \\"what ifs\\" and nostalgic \\"blasts from the pasts.\\"<br />Technically I'll give King credit for his page-turning ability at prodding a reader through 842 pages. Once I started Jake Epping's/George Amberson's journey, I couldn't put the book down and that was even trudging through the saggy-bottom middle, which is common for most novels.<br />But King's faux pos in this lengthy endeavor to save JFK's life was how he subjected me and others---according to several reviews I've read---through a sludge of recycled rear window scenes as Mr. Amberson's voyeurism got the best of him and punished us with an ad nauseum of page after page of Oswald, Marina, and De Mohrenshildt narrative and dialogue.<br />And the ending...ahh (shrugs). In my opinion the Yellow, Blue, Black, and Green Card Men should have remained inexplicable sentries of the portal of time. The whole explanation of differing strings of time...I don't know, became a little too technical and wonkish. The portal should have remained inside his initial plot line as time as a mysterious point of entropy screaming out with literary nascence that the mysteries of the universe are unanswerable questions and should remain that way.<br />All in all, I'll rate SK a 6 on his effort, or as they say in Spain: mas o menos.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My Grandson Loves this app, it is awesome and FREE I have had no problems with this at all. I reccommend it to anyone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day should be a must read for every thinking person.  I'm glad Matt Bissonnette took the time to record his account of what actually happened and to set the record straight, and didn't back down to the threats of the politicians about divulging classified information.  Bissonnette clearly loves our country and honors his commitments to our government and his fellow soldiers.  The book is extremely well written and readable.  Some of the general media, journalists, and all of the current administration in Wash, DC have certainly taken liberties, attempting to take personal credit for what our brave and dedicated Military and CIA actually accomplished.  After more than 10 years of hard work and intense training for a mission that included genuine high risk, justice was done.  Thank you to our US Military in general and to the SEALS and their support crews everywhere.  The politicians shown huddling around the monitor with our current President in all the US media coverage of the Bin Laden raid were more concerned about their own jobs and political future, while the people on the ground actually did the work and ran the life and death risk of getting the job done.  Read the book.  It's important!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|In my opinion, Ken Follet is an excellent story teller. \\"Winter of the World\\", as well as \\"Fall of Giants\\", keeps you entertained, following different story lines and connecting the dots between them.  It´s a great book!

Worth reading for sure.
B000001FLI|5.0|Since hearing \\"Sweet Dreams\\" during the closing credits of \\"The Departed\\", I was determined to find this guitar player. I don't play myself, but I enjoy Clapton and Robert Cray. It is so satisfying to hear this artist fill a room with guitar. Truthfully the solos open my heart in such a way that I can sense God's Holy Spirit in a real way. Short album but I would call it conscise. No waste, no fill, all good.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could not finish this and only got it because so many people were singing its praises.  This is easily the most poorly written book I've read in the past ten years.  I'm not sure how many times the author can say that \\"Christian smells delicious\\" or that Anastasia is once again \\"biting her lower lip\\".<br /><br />Seriously, if you want or need a little sexual thrill in your life, there's got to be something better than reading a really crappy book.
0783229372|4.0|This film is a mostly nice attempt to summarize the events that lead up to the Hindenburg's distruction on may sixth, 1937, as it was completing the first voyage of its second season of service.  Because this ship completed its first flight season without a single passenger mishap, it was thought to be safe.  The film begins nicely with a grainy but historically accurate black and white seen describing the history of airship travel, but as the film progresses, some accuracies become apparent to those who have previously read on the Hindenburg disaster.  If historical inaccuracies drive you nuts, then I would stay away from this film, but it's still a good one to watch.  What I was most disappointed with is the fact that the actors meant to play the German crew of the airship weren't themselves German, and spoke with no accent, as is apparent in Hogan's heroes.  The model of the Hindenburg that was used in the movie is on display at the Aeronautics and Space Museum in Washington. D.C.  If you're willing to overlook its flaws, it is truely a piece worth watching!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I don't know how Lee Childs comes up with the different plots.  But Jack Reacher is the best character in fiction.  He is a stone cold mystery solving machine.  Championing good and right over evil and wrong.  This is a great mystery right from the beginning and the ending is just what I wanted.  This is a great read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am usually not into fictional books, but because of all the hype surrounding I decided to give it a go. I really enjoyed the book and ended up buying part two.

I recommend the book for someone who wants to understand one person perspective on BDSM. It is definitely a page turner.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|This 2.5 hour long movie achieves the rarest of feats- it manages to not feel like it's 2.5 hours long. The pacing and storytelling of \\"The Avengers\\" is incredible, and I was entertained throughout. It surely goes without saying at this point, but the special effects are top notch, and the transfer to Blu-ray gives your hi-def TV the workout it was built to handle. Best of all, this movie is laugh-out-loud funny, giving viewers (especially Marvel fans) a real treat.<br /><br />Most surprising of all is the great chemistry that exists between the huge cast of characters, none of whom are wholeheartedly interested in the idea of a team of superheroes. Robert Downey is his usual, witty self, and has so much charisma that his arrogance is endearing, rather than off-putting. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans each do a serviceable job in their roles, although Hemsworth never quite gets the same momentum that he achieved in \\"Thor\\" (probably because we don't get to see his earlier, fun loving side). My favorite performance was that of Mark Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner. The Hulk is my favorite comic character, and I thought that Norton and Bana each did a great job portraying Bruce Banner in the previous movies. But Ruffalo was a great choice, and his mannerisms and delivery of lines seem just right for the precarious life of Banner.<br /><br />With such a loaded cast of heroes on screen, Marvel and Disney do not disappoint. They seem to have been fully aware that fans would want all-out brawls, not just a united battle against some vague enemy. As such, we get to see wonderful battles between the lot of them, with the prize going to a showdown between powerhouses Thor and Hulk aboard a flying aircraft carrier. Anybody who had even a passing interest in comic books when they grew up will take great pleasure in watching this destructive rumble between titans.<br /><br />There are a couple of hiccups in the cast, unfortunately. Loki still looks like an extra from the Slitherin House of a Harry Potter movie, and I have no idea why, in a movie of this colossal budget, they would wardrobe him in a cheap costume that looks like it was purchased on a budget at iParty. He never comes through as a convincing villain, and his acting is best described as \\"angry, melodramatic teenager\\". But I thoroughly enjoyed his \\"battle\\" with the Hulk... that was great.<br /><br />The Black Widow and Hawkeye do a decent job holding their own, although it's kind of silly to see two regular humans trying to keep up with Thor and the Hulk... characters who are essentially demi-gods, and all but invincible. You would think they would at least invest in a helmet, or something. Hopefully they will have a smaller role in the inevitable sequel, leaving more screen time for the heavy hitters.<br /><br />Despite these small hiccups, \\"The Avengers\\" is a fantastic action movie, with strong influences pulled from \\"The Ultimates\\" (an alternate universe Marvel take from about ten years ago). It's hardly deep, and it doesn't answer enough questions (leaving room for the sequel), but it does what it's supposed to do: it entertains, and on an epic scale.f a Harry Potter movie, and I have no idea why, in a movie of this colossal budget, they would wardrobe him in a cheap costume that looks like it was purchased on a budget at iParty.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book, I could not wait to get the 2nd and it did not disappoint.  What a great trilogy of books!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Hard to believe an album this perfect could get any 1 or 2 star ratings.  Relative to rest of the foo catalog, this album is second only to Colour and Shape. The writing, performance, and production are all top notch.  No filler.  All quality tracks. Album is not as hard as colour and shape but quality is just as good. Dave and crew have somehow found the perfect middle ground that should appeal to just about everyone.  Foo Fighters have rebounded from a couple lackluster previous releases (relatively speaking) with a phenomenal album!  If you liked 'colour and shape', 'skin and bones', and 'in your honor', you'll love this album.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show was recommended to me by a friend.  Based on what little I knew about the show, I wasn't sure I would like it.  But what a surprise, it is amazing work!
B0099LDUFI|5.0|Pink is wonderful!!  The lyrics are amazingly true and also many times quite playful!!  If you are a Pink fan you will love this CD.  As a recent convert I truly love it!!!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The plot made it interesting. Special effects was great. Never seen charlize theron so ugly! Very good makeup. But its a fantasy movie.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Over the past several years my daughter and I have enjoyed watching this movie time and time again.  There is a 30 year age difference between us but we both thoroughly enjoy it.  I am purchasing another copy because we seem to have misplaced our original and we both miss it dearly!  I can't wait to have Mr. Thornton back in my life!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Ok for the younger generation(especially females).My daughter enjoy it more. Can't see why a 2nd part would be needed but I guess to complete the book series.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|With each page I get more drawn in.  Half way through and already dreading finishing.  It is so wonderful to have something to look forward to at the end of the day.  TV and Movies are just brief encounters with not many layers due to time constraints.  With a great book, you can savor over many nights or hours, learning more details with each visit.  Loving that it's a trilogy.  Good Job Ms. Harkness!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed the first of the trilogy - \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\", but thought it lacked much of a story - lots of sex.  The second book even less, and the third very little.  More plot and story and less sex - like any good thing to excess is boring.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozed plays just like the penny arcade classic. Being a cheapskate, I don't buy coins, but they generate even when you are not playing.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The effects were good, but overall not impressed with Stewart.  Plays the same character every time.  A fan of Hemsworth and Theron in this one.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first book in this trilogy.  Enjoyed the second.  But this book (Mockingjay) missed the mark.  Characters seem forced and the story is all over the place.  On the positive side, it was a good and somewhat easy read (just like the first two) but there is too much stuff and it is too technical.  Just my $.02
B0041VP1FI|4.0|Splice certainly has its issues, but it should still be a treat for hardcore sci fi fans. Don't watch it if you're looking for a traditional \\"scary movie.\\" Watch it if you're looking for something smart, disturbing, and beautifully animated,  and be ready for a few plot holes and some seriously scary sex.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A whimsical yet surprisingly spiritual walk through the world, filled with unique characters and observations.  An invitation to reflect on the unlikely pilgrimages of our own lives.
B0099114WO|4.0|When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's [[ASIN:B0018RC7QE Falling in Love]] (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel ([[ASIN:B000MKD9P6 The Devil Wears Prada]]) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.<br /><br />An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.<br /><br />At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.le.

0452289963|1.0|This book is one long w..k. It tells you to get rid of your ego, intellect, personality, emotions, and opinions, and just let your \\"spirit\\" shine, through your beiged out physical presentation. For all people who want to be as dull and boring as Tolle, take this book's advice. That is, if you can make any sense out of it. Oh, that's right, you just have to read the words and let his \\"Presence\\" flow through you without rational comprehension...... (rolls eyes)<br />Save your money, and listen to Skyhooks' \\"Ego is not a dirty word\\" (1975) for a cheezy corrective to this Oprah-recommended drivel.

B0087HT36U|5.0|love the game,; easy, fast, and fun to play. the whole family likes the challenging but achievable play and the game has been glitches free so far on three devices.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  Can't stop playing. I loved it when I was young. Its even better when I play it only kindle.
B003SI5NX0|5.0|The family watched this for the first time and really enjoyed it. This is the Disney release that just predated the Disney renascence which came with the Little Mermaid. After all these years I wish we had viewed the film before. The film is a bit dated in terms of presentation (has a real 80's feel) but the story was charming and little Oliver (a young Joseph (Joey) Lawrence whoa!) was cute.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good story but you could get that from the movie. written poorly on a local level although that might be to be expected.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|It is made apparent throughout this book that the author has done considerable research and has gone through the trial and error process long enough to be able to deliver a combined workout and nutrition program that is both understandable and achievable.  \\"Bigger Leaner Stronger\\" is the one book that made me realize that I was done with the research (for now) and ready for the gym.<br /><br />Fitness and nutrition are complex sciences that can be studied over a lifetime.  \\"Bigger Leaner Stronger\\" delivers the knowledge needed to begin immediately while thoughtfully directing the reader away from many myths and marketing tricks of the fitness industry.<br /><br />Thanks to the author for going through the effort of sharing his knowledge and wisdom.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is about a totally dysfunctional couple; Travis and Abby.  I don't know why I liked them so much, but I did!!  Maybe because this brought back memories of my college days...bad relationships, bad decisions, and so much fun!!

1419702203|5.0|This lovely homage tells George Harrison's life story through (mostly his own) photos and quotes.  Through his early friendship with McCartney and Lennon and the band's first years, then the difficulties of fame and subsequent life as an ex-Beatle, to spiritual searching and parenthood, the entries shed light on the not-so-public man, putting into perspective his philosophy as he lived it.  A rewarding read for anyone with an interest in the Beatles, spirituality, or both.
0525953728|5.0|An excellent presentation. Contrary to the opinion of our Government there is nothing in this book that places our country in harms way and no secrets given that would have an impact on our country. Mark Ownen deserves much credit as well as all our young men and women servinf in our armed forces today. As a retired U.S. Navy Chief HospitalCorpsmani salute Mark and everyone.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Great cd from Maroon 5.  Even though it has a different sound from previous CDs, I enjoy every song on it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I am so torn about this book. As other's have noted, this book is like crack - or maybe a bad car accident. There are so many horrible things going on but you just cannot help but keep watching - or reading - and despite ridiculous actions on the part of the main characters I just could not help but go back for more. I found myself totally and completely enthralled by Abby and Travis.<br /><br />Abby is trying to escape her past and Travis is attempting to fill a void by sleeping with anything that moves. They meet and Travis is immediately drawn to Abby because she is the one girl who doesn't take his crap and doesn't want to sleep with him.<br /><br />Except that she DOES take his crap! Over and over again! And he takes her crap - BEGS her for it, in fact. This relationship is the epitome of dysfunction. Travis has real problems with anger and jealousy and obsessive tendencies and if Abby were my daughter I would tell her to run in the other direction. Abby, on the other hand, while attempting to stay strong only ends up stringing him along.<br /><br />Despite the dysfunction, I found myself cheering for the couple and wanted the obligatory Happily Ever After. I knew these bad things were going to happen and rip them apart and I knew that they would get back together. I knew it - yet I still wanted all the details. Ms. McGuire's writing is very good, pulls you into the story and doesn't let go. Once you start you have to keep going.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to fans of contemporary romance who don't mind some mildly disturbing scenes (anger and obsession - nothing physical). I would not recommend this to young teenagers. I am shocked that this book is shelved so often as Young Adult. The characters may be young (they are in college) but the themes and situations here are not appropriate for many teens. This book includes lots of underage drinking, use of fake ID's, underground fight clubs, gambling, unprotected sex and other mature themes. Mature older teens who can tell the difference between reality and fiction may enjoy this but the themes here are not appropriate for many.<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions are 100% my own.r teens who can tell the difference between reality and fiction may enjoy this but the themes here are not appropriate for many.<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a Russian spy by a Russian spy named Orlov.  Salt denies being a Russian spy, but her counter intelligence colleagues are divided about whether or not this is true.  She makes a break for it, escaping from her colleagues.  The movie follows Salt as she uncovers the truth behind Orlov's accusation, all while dodging pursuit from numerous, heavily armed U. S. agents.  The action is intense, and plentiful.  I think all aspects of Jolie's portrayal of Salt are believable, and well done.  The film does fail in some points.<br /><br />Part of the plot near the end of the theatrical release is sketchy.  A witness is left alive, one whose testimony would be fatal to their attacker.  This is addressed in the director's cut.  U. S. agents shooting at Salt in situations crowded with civilians, and in traffic, stretches credibility for me.  Next, there are too many happy (for Salt) coincidences during Salt's escape from the U. S. agents.  Four different vehicles -- perfect for her needs -- just happen by, at just the right time, for Salt to use.  The result is an incredible action sequence that's tainted by too many unbelievable coincidences.  Salt so effectively evades those searching for her, I don't think she could have done a better job of avoiding detection if she wore a cloak of invisibility.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with the film is that Salt seems to have suprahuman healing abilities.  She takes on some physical damage that would result in a mere mortal having an extended hospital stay, if they even survived.  Yet, Salt walks away from such events, usually with only a bit of a limp, a grimace, and a sideways glance.  At times, Salt comes across like the X-Men's Wolverine, due to her amazing recuperative powers.<br /><br />The story does a nice job handling the truth about whether or not Salt is a Russian spy.  Jolie is the standout, as her portrayal shows Salt as being complex.  From being vulnerable and gentle towards those Salt cares about, to being chillingly efficient when attacking an adversary.<br /><br />Overall, I think the movie is a worth viewing.From being vulnerable and gentle towards those Salt cares about, to being chillingly efficient when attacking an adversary.<br /><br />Overall, I think the movie is a worth viewing.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|A new Reacher novel is usually a sure thing. He'll do amazing things physically while psyching out his opponents. This latest book was disappointing. The plot has some major flaws, why did 3 in the car continue undercover for the sake of one person who was going to be killed anyway?<br />Lee Child added some word games to add a bit of suspense to a story that didn't hang together too well. Maybe Reacher was tired, hitchhiking around with his broken nose, or maybe Child just called this one in.<br />It won't stop me from reading the next book he writes, but I hope it's a better one.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Good graphics and good game play equals good time! The whole family enjoys this game. Great for quick fixes while waiting or just sitting town and going at it.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett surprises us again with a wonderfully written book! The interlink between the first book and the second is very well done, keeping all in place (both history and characters)! When I finish this 2nd book, am I sure I will be looking forward to the 3rd! Excellent book!

0670022705|5.0|Okay so i needed this book for my History class, and it was super expensive in Barnes n nobles so i decided to buy it from Amazon. It arrived just in time before my next assignment. It came in great condition & smelled so good (like a new book). Anyways, the book itself is interesting and informative. I recommend !
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book will make you forget about the Hunger Games. Although Percy has to share spotlight with equally heroic people, you won't put the book down.
B006UN3K4O|4.0|Great book makes you think before you answer your partner so things run smoothly.<br />I found reading a man perpective on how women think and feel very interesting and<br />in some cases rather funny, he must of done alot of study.
B002ZG98LO|3.0|Predators is a nice return to form in many aspects. It brings the Predator franchise back to it's roots rather than continuing the rather lackluster performance of the past Alien vs. Predator sequels. While this film is nowhere near as good as the first predator film it is still a nice, fun, romp into the predator universe. None of the characters are terribly deep or all that complex and could even be accused of being rather two-dimensional, but for a fun action/horror film like this I'd argue they really don't need to be. As long as you don't go into Predators expecting a terribly deep film you'll end up enjoying it for what it is: A decent return to what is at the heart of the predator franchise.
B000001F29|4.0|Good songs, especially the title track, but the sound quality could be better. No matter which stereo I use, I have to turn the volume way up (compared to any other CD) in order to hear the music.

B0041H18MM|4.0|Arvo Part is an Estonian composer whose music is some of the most extraordinary work of the 20th -- and now 21st -- century.  Ethereal, abstract, moving, yet powerfully real, immediate, and impactful.  While there are numerous CDs with a great deal of his individual compositions, this album does contain many of his celebrated pieces.  Thus, it is worth the purchase and definitely worth listening to closely.  Part's music is unusual, and can transport the listener to another sphere of experience.  Beautiful, spiritual, and complex, it resonates in a way few other composers can accomplish.  This CD is a good introduction -- next, begin listening to his other CDs and you will hear an even more transcendent sound.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Emma Donoghue's Room, and my novel, Out of Breath, have been on the same Amazon Kindle Top 100 chart (Psychological Thriller) for a number of months. Consequently, I've been eager to read it through the lense of an author, and as a former therapist specializing in trauma. I was NOT disappointed. Wow! I read Room as I cooked, waited for appointments, and even (woops) in place of my writing time! Emma Donoghue's ability to capture the voice of a five year old who is struggling to make sense of \\"room\\", then later (spoiler alert), the world of freedom, is truly a gift. I'm anxious to read her previous works and look forward to her next project. Emma, if you read your reviews, I'd love to have you on my blog,[...] for an interview!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this solitaire game. Would have given five star rating if it weren't for the adds. Love MobilityWare apps.<br />Always great games.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is a fun way to while away some spare time.  The graphics are good and the sound effects are cute.  The only reason I give it just 4 stars is because it takes so long to generate the free coins.  You can buy coins, if you want, but I almost never do.  But, I would play a much longer time and more often if the coins were available.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Once again Mr. Follett does a masterful job of explaining accurate historical details while blending his characters into the mix.  Because of this I got a great reminder (along with learning many additional details) of what and why history occurred the way it did, as well as getting a taste of how those involved might have felt; something lacking in most history courses.  Together you can't help but get a deeper appreciation for the highs and lows of the times, which really makes this (and all of his books) page turners.  As long as he keeps writing this type of novel, I will continue to read them.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I read this book because my daughter had to read it for school. The first three chapters were hard due to the new language the author uses. (recommendation: get the dictionary from the web and print it so you can look up the new words). After a while you can read with no trouble. At the beginning I was astound by the violence and couldn't understand how this book got good reviews. But as I got to the middle part it changed pace and the depth a in which the author goes to show us how society deals with violence or differences was mind blowing. I just hope my daughter can understand what was able to appreciate at her age. It is written well. The violent parts are really strong you feel like you are there. The other sections really make you think about life, society, laws and our behavior. I really recommend the book
0525953728|5.0|A good read.  Interesting background on Seals which I didn't know.  I believe the Pentagon overrated the intelligence value of this book, however.  Author is very careful not to reveal identities of participants.  If there are secrets here and I don't believe there are, they are well hidden. The views of the compound are on Google maps.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Season four was absolutely exciting.  I just can't get enough of this show.  I can't wait to see season Five.  Every episode leads to more shocking and excitement.  When it's over, I want more.
B0078JOU0W|5.0|Loved it so much!  Can't wait for Season 3!!!! Season 1 was very good too!  Love Daisy, Anna, and all of the characters.  Wonder if the marriage will actually take place?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the last book of the trilogy, even though I wanted to read it so much, it was sad to finish it.  I wish there was another book. It left me wanting more. But since I have it on my Kindle I will read all three again. Yes it was that good. I know some people are thrown off by the begining of the first book, but getting to know Christian and Anastasia and how there relationship grows is wonderful. It is a great escape from everyday world.

B007VYDFMS|5.0|I really, really, really (did I mention REALLY) enjoyed this documentary on Bob Marley. There were so many different things I had no knowledge about but learned from watching this documentary. Most people seemed to want all the meat and potatoes regarding the assassination attempt, the bands conflict(s) (if present) to the separation of two of the members which was not addressed in detail. I felt the overall tone of this documentary was to provide a positive outlook on the man, the music n the legend not to divulge on the negative. The above situations most people were hoping to get greater in depth insight on (Bunny Wailer & Peter Tosh splitting off from the Wailers, etc.) were alluded to or mentioned briefly but never went into great lengths which can be deemed positive or negative by many; especially big Marley fans. I myself wished the director did decide to go there but  can see why he went the course he did. I mean there are many books out there on Bob and the Wailers for those wishing to get the who/why and what. The movie has wetted my appetite to know more (which I think was their goal to do so its been accomplished). I plan on buying this DVD (as I streamed it from Amazon as a Prime Member) and also a book or two to find out more on his formative years with the Wailers and thereafter. I would and have suggested for any Marley lover to watch this film.<br /><br />I do have one gripe though, I'm an islander...I know the patois. I wished I could've been able to turn off the damn subtitle as I couldn't focus on what was being said because my eyes were being constantly drawn to the subtitle. I don't know if there's an option on the DVD to do so but I hope so.<br /><br />Oh and those who are griping about lack of concert video footage there are other videos out there for purchase on his concerts. This is not a concert video documentary showing nothing but. However, if you want to know what motivated Nesta Robert Marley, about his life growing up in Jamaica, hisfamilies (mother and father's) influence, the faith Bob embraced; Rastafari & promoted, what motivated Bob, his life and work ethics then this is the film to watch. And even if you've read and seen everything there is already on Bob, I'd say watch this too.<br /><br />In laymans terms...this movie is about the man, the music & the legend; Bob Marley. It is not about not going to school, smoking ganja and having a bunch of kids. Its about the choices one man made in his struggle to come to terms with his life, his religion and his love of music. Nesta Robert Marly has spread Reggae and the Rastafari movement ALL around the world. There isn't a nation who does not know who Bob Marley is, his music crosses boundaries and cultures.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is great. It's kind of like being in a mystery novel. I could not put it down. Buy it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I'm a 74 year old used-to-be ex trail runner who hasn't run trails for nearly 25 years because of problems with my feet. A friend of mine who just completed traveling the entire length of the Continental Divide Trail told me about this book and the subject it covered.  He also told me he switched from conventional trail shoes to the minimalist \\"Barefoot\\" shoe with outstanding positive results<br /><br />After reading less than 100 pages, I went out and bought a pair of \\"Barefoot\\" type trail shoes the book seemed to endorse.  After I tried them out on a treadmill for about 10 days, finishing the book, and conducting additional research on the subject over the internet, I field tested them on a steep stretch of trail on Mt. Wanda, a recreation area in Martinez, CA.  I was able to power walk and slow jog up about 1 1/2 miles of the trail (in about 4o minutes) and jog at a medium pace down (in about 18 minutes) with total foot comfort and stability..<br /><br />Two day after this feat, my feet feel great.  Persistent numbness in areas of both feet have disappeared, as has heal pain, and, more importantly, my balance is steadily improving.  I haven't worn any of my 2 dozen pairs of conventional athletic or casual shoes for about 2 weeks now, opting instead to wear \\"Barefoot shoes\\" (I purchased a second pair of the same trail shoe and a casual shoe of the same design and structure) or go naturally barefoot (something I have avoided doing my entire life).<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest that others will have the same results from reading the book and subscribing to the \\"Barefoot\\" phenomena, I am not a person who is fad prone or is unduly influenced by slick product advertising propaganda, but I am sold on this book's value and grateful for the opportunity it delivered to improve my health and attitude.<br /><br />Beside the technical subject matter related to running and foot gear, it is a damn good story very well told.<br /><br />Alex Cortlund
0817439390|5.0|Anyone attempting photography struggles with exposure, it can be difficult and frustrating to say the least.  I found this book to be very helpful and provided the information I need through clear examples, understandable language, and fun projects.  I recommend this book to all beginners.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is a great, budget automatic watch. It's a little on the smaller side, but if that's what you're looking for, then it's for you. The color in the picture is the actual color on the watch. The lume is adequate, but not spectacular. It won't last you all night, but for the money you can't complain. The low-profile crown being at 4 o'clock is super comfortable. The strap is pretty good. This is an all around great buy.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Hard  to follow at times. Do not care for this type of book. Stared out good but just did not like
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I love this movie.  I saw it thrice in the theaters - and paid full price each time.  Some acting and bad-guy-scene issues aside, the pacing was great, the characters were fantastic, the visuals were outstanding, and the sound effects were thrilling.<br /><br />So it's not the movies itself that is the problem.  And I am not going to write a full review on the plot, etc; there are plenty of reviews that cover it in great detail.  Nor am I going to gripe about the iOS exclusivity of the digital content - that was sort of a given, and I bought this package at $20 (which was subsequently lowered even further) anyway.<br /><br />I would like to address the sound quality.  What a JOKE!  There are two options on the BD: stereo and 7.1.  I have a 5.1 setup, so that 7.1 doesn't work out so well for me.<br /><br />Now, you may say, \\"Hey, that's just a technical listing, and your system should be able to figure it out to give you the best sound.\\"<br /><br />Nope.  You would be wrong.  There were a full two channels missing in the audio, which was most obvious during the Iron Man clips, where you hear a sort of canned close echo when he speaks - except, not on a 5.1 system.  Those nuances disappear with the lack of those side speakers.<br /><br />Now, I was able to MacGyver a pseudo-solution to make it sound presentable, but it still is not the thrill-ride movie experience that I was fully expecting.<br /><br />Haven't tried it yet, but I'm willing to bet that the DVD has the 5.1 sound options.  That would be great: Buy a BD special pack, and choose between decent audio and quality picture.<br /><br />All in all, an extraordinarily disappointing product, one of the few times I wish I'd have stuck with Netflix.

B009CPES4I|4.0|A stellar cast has been given plenty to do in order to show off their best acting, and comedic skills. Well-written with plenty of heart, this film is one to sit back and enjoy from start to finish. With all the atmosphere and wonderful aroma of India to many interconnected stories that all ring true, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is far better than most would imagine and well-worth watching. The exotic location is an additional character that fills every scene with interest as a stellar cast of characters show us life as it really is for all of them-the good, the bad, the sad and glorious. It's all there served up in an enticing script that makes one feel good all over. Watch it and take an absolutely fascinating trip to India. You'll make lots of new friends as you laugh and cry at the wonder of life with its many twists and turns...and through it all the stunning beauty of India. We learn just a little more about all that it means to be alive and fully engaged, though some of the hotel's guests are less evolved than others. However, it is their loss, not ours as this movie has an abundance of heart! What a wonderful journey to a far off land with a bunch of misfits who do their best...to fit. Their journey is even better than the destination!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The whole family really enjoyed this one! Lots of fun, indeed. If you've been following the other Marvel movies leading up to this, you'll most likely enjoy this one too. The minor issue... so, after watching the  movie, I figured I'd do the digital download stuff and get that out of the way... looked at the insert, and the code box was completely blank! Amazon took care of getting a replacement out to me in short order and everything is good!
1400052181|5.0|I originally read this book because I was required to for a class. I ended up loving the book so much that I was thankful it was a required read. I learned so much and I questioned so much. I am thankful for Henrietta and believe her story is one that needed to be told. She deserves it!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, will spend hours with it. Moves along well, graphics are good, and character levels up quickly. My only gripe is that unless you want to use real money to get the gear upgrades, you have to repeat levels to gain the in game money to upgrade. The multi-player mode is a lot fun too.
0307592731|5.0|An incredible book that I finished in about 24 hours because I couldn't put it down. Cheryl's journey is one that anyone can relate to. This book made me laugh and cry.

I hope it can inspire others the way it inspired me.
B003WGM40S|5.0|I was disappointed with the novel, though I should have predicted it would be like that, being written before the age of movies, being heavy on description and light on dialogue. I was hoping I would find more dialogue than was in the movie but there really isn't, at least of any interest, unless you want to hear about cows and farming instead of the character's thoughts.<br />Anyway, back to what I mentioned in the title of this review, this version gives Tess more dignity and credit for intelligence, and also brings out the real source for her downfall, pride.

B0080XN3C6|5.0|I first saw Kimbra perform on the Jimmie Kimmel show. Something about her music, her voice and her stage presence was memorable, perhaps even unique. I bought \\"Vows\\", her first work, and have listened to most or all of it every day for the past two months. I cannot believe this woman is only 22 years old. She has such command of her varying musical themes. Her music is thoughtful and beautiful, intimate and celebratory. I've searched her on YouTube to find a wide variety of live versions of her songs which show her to be even more versatile and imaginative. Kimbra's music sounds almost chameleonesque in that sometimes I hear hints of Kate Bush or Bjork (two of my all-time favorites); other times I'm swept along by her urgent percussion accompaniment; still other times I'll just gather bookmarks from YouTube and listen to her perform 3-4 remarkably different versions of one wonderful song (try this with Two Way Street for a real treat). Kimbra's music seems genuine, she is vastly musically skilled and somehow her music seems lushly organic but at the same time pointed and precise. So affected have I been by Kimbra's music that I, a creaky 60 year old man, am dragging my wife to a dance club in Boston in two weeks to hear Kimbra perform live. Yes, yes, she was \\"the girl\\" in Somebody That I Used To Know. I didn't even find that out until I was already familiar with Vows. If that connection helps her find a wider audience we are all the better for it.  I wish I had more than five stars.

B008220DGE|3.0|The Master, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, Boogie Nights), is one of those films that tend leave viewers in one of three distinct camps: enraptured, annoyed or baffled. The camp you will fall into depends largely on whether you're a fan of the director. In my case, I find myself in the baffled camp. On the plus side, The Master is beautifully shot, with meticulous attention to detail, and has truly outstanding performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix. On the minus side, the further you get into the movie, the more you begin to wonder what the point is.<br /><br />The film begins at the end of WWII where we meet Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a Navy man stationed somewhere in the Pacific. Quell is a walking mess, seriously alcoholic and subject to crude sexual impulses.  He is also apparently dysfunctionally stressed as he ends up in some kind of mental treatment program prior to his discharge. After the war, he gets a job as a department store photographer, but this soon goes sour due to his worsening alcoholism, aggressive impulses and inability to control himself. After getting into a fight with a customer, he falls further down the spiral, ending up in a migrant farm worker camp in California where his home-made hooch ends up poisoning one of his fellow workers and he end up fleeing for his life. His flight takes him onto a moored yacht where he passes out, only awakening the next day when the ship is at sea. He is woken by a young woman named Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers) who takes him to meet her father, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman).<br /><br />At first, Freddie doesn't know what to make of Dodd or of his situation. Expecting to be thrown off the ship, Freddie is puzzled to find that he's been taken under Dodd's wing and treated like a guest. What Dodd's status is is unclear. He's apparently a guest himself on the yacht, but everyone defers to him as if he in fact owned it and everyone on it. Gradually Freddie learns that Dodd is the head of a philosophical movement called The Cause which uses a technique Dodd has created called Processing to help people deal with remembering traumas so that they can deal with them, traumas from not only this life but from previous lives as well. Dodd has taken an interest in Freddie, partly because, as he confesses, he likes Freddie's home-made hooch, but also because he sees Freddie as the severely dysfunctional person he is, an ideal subject for his Processing technique which he starts on Freddie while they're on the yacht.<br /><br />In short order, Freddie ends up in Dodd's inner circle of The Cause, somewhat to the puzzlement and annoyance of those closest to Dodd: his wife Peggy (Amy Adams), his daughter Elizabeth, and his new son-in-law Clark (Rami Malek). When they travel to the east coast, Freddie sees Dodd at work, visiting his rather well-to-do followers who, Freddie discovers, tend to address Dodd as \\"Master\\". As Freddie's involvement in The Cause deepens and his relationship with Dodd grows more involved, he finds himself growing more protective of Dodd, to the point of physically assaulting anyone whom he sees as a threat to Dodd.  Even Dodd's teenaged son from a previous marriage ,Val (Jesse Plemmons), is subjected to Freddie's violently defensive impulses when he carelessly tells Freddie that Dodd is \\"just making it all up as he goes along.\\"<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are both outstanding in their roles. Phoenix in particular uses facial expression and sheer physicality to radiate just how damaged a man Freddie is, moving about at times like a nervous, disjointed scarecrow, barely able to hold his limbs together. You cringe just watching Phoenix's Freddie move about the screen, not really wanting to watch a man that messed up yet unable to look away because Pheonix's performance is so riveting.  Hoffman's Dodd is, on the surface, Freddie's polar opposite - smoother, charmingly personable, more than a little charismatic, and deftly manipulative.  But Hoffman gradually reveals Dodd to be in many ways as off-kilter internally as Freddie is, subject to similar impulses of anger, self-indulgence, and resentment of any authority but his own.  He's just better at keeping it concealed and functioning with it.  Hoffman manages to make his Dodd both affably winning even as he's clearly being manipulative, walking a line so fine that you're never quite sure of the extent to which Dodd really believes what he's saying to people.  If Dodd's feet are indeed made of clay, he himself seems blissfully unwilling to concede even the possibility of it, no matter how contradictory some of his actions are to the things he says.  It's impossible to have a cult if the leader of that cult has not conned himself into being his own first follower.<br /><br />In addition, as I noted at the beginning, the cinematography in The Master is superb, giving an almost palpable textured feel to each scene, whether it's a beach in the Pacific war zone, a late-40's department store, a luxury yacht, or an up-scale suburban bungalow, immersing you in Americana as it existed in the period.  Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr., who also did the cinematography on Francis Ford Coppola's Youth Without Youth and Tetro, did an exquisite job here and deserves a nomination come Academy Award time.<br /><br />But as masterful as Phoenix and Hoffman's performances are and as good as the film looks on the screen, the further the film goes on, the more the script and editing let them down. Instead of things becoming clearer, they become more muddled, with character's attitudes and behavior seeming to change abruptly for no apparent reason. Plot threads seem to veer off into nowhere and we're never sure if they were supposed to lead anywhere or not. One thread that is brought up in a couple of scenes is a strange not-quite-relationship that Freddie almost had with the younger sister of a navy buddy, a teenage high school sophomore named Doris (Madisen Beaty). The scenes suggest this is relevant somehow but just how is never made clear.  Masturbation as both a lack of control (Freddie) and a means of control (Peggy on Dodd) shows up in a couple of scenes, but also never seems to go anywhere.<br /><br />Other scenes were confusing for different reasons. At one point Dodd is at a party singing the sea chanty \\"Go No More A Roving\\" to enthralled guests. In mid-scene, suddenly all of the women in the room - young and old - are naked even as Dodd keeps right on singing.  Is this real, or just Freddie having a sexual fantasy?  Given how few people in the film ever seem to react to strange behavior, it's hard to tell.  The waters are further muddied when later that night Peggy chastises Dodd in private for what sounds like his having dalliances with other women, but there's never been any hint of this in any of the rest of the film.  Other scenes just seem disjointed, like Dodd taking Freddie out into the desert to dig up what is apparently his manuscript for his second book.  Why is it there?  No explanation.  When it's published, one of Dodd's followers, Helen (Laura Dern), is upset to find that Dodd is apparently changing some aspects of his Processing teachings.  From a manuscript buried in the desert?  Why?  No explanation.  At one point Freddie impulsively takes off, leaving Dodd and The Cause for no apparent reason.  Then months later suddenly returns after apparently having a vision of receiving a phone call from Dodd while sleeping in a movie theater.<br /><br />Another part of the problem is that it felt like most of the other characters were not all that well thought out, not the fault of the actors but of the script. Amy Adams' Peggy in particular I found more than a little confusing. In a number of scenes, she comes across as something of a ruthless manipulator herself, somewhere between a Lady MacBeth and Angela Lansbury's Mrs. Iselin from TheManchurian Candidate. You wonder if she is in fact the force/power behind Dodd, but the hints are never explored and never lead anywhere. They're just there. Dodd's newlywed daughter is sexually suggestive towards Freddie in a couple of scenes, then suspicious of and hostile towards him in others, but nothing is made of either. Clark is openly hostile to Freddie, possibly because he sees Freddie as a rival, not only for Elizabeth but for the position of being Dodd's spiritual \\"son\\". But the reasons are never explored and Clark and Elizabeth essentially just vanish before the end of the film.<br /><br />The further along things went, the more I found myself wondering what the point of it all was, and at the end of the film, I found that that I really had no idea. Was Freddie changed by his encounter with Dodd, for better or for worse?  Was Dodd changed by his encounter with Freddie?  Was anyone changed by anything that happened?  It was never made clear.  The strong performances had kept me engaged throughout so that in spite of being frequently confused I was never bored, but in the end I just couldn't get a handle on what I'd seen.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Paul Thomas Anderson, for Hoffman and Phoenix's performances, and for anyone interested in a somewhat disjointed look at leader-follower relationships and cultish manipulation, but with the caution that it may in the end leave you at best scratching your head or at worst feeling more than a little annoyed.navy buddy, a teenage high school sophomore named Doris (Madisen Beaty).

1250010489|5.0|Coauthoring four technical books with Mark, I always knew he had what it took to create a compelling novel.  His first, Zero Day, left me wanting to hear more of the life of cyber-hunters Jeff and Daryl. Trojan Horse, the sequel, is a globe spanning thriller that kept me engaged from start to finish. Both are scary real - and technically accurrate - must reads for anyone who wants to get an inside view of the potential damage that can be inflicted in the world of cyberterrorism while enjoying a wild ride of a story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finally, the \\"Real Story\\" on the termination of Osama Bin Laden. This book is a well written narrative of what went down and how the mission was approached, without all of the media and political spin on who gets credit. The author deserves a sincere \\"thank you\\" from the American people for the dedication and courage in doing his job, as well as standing up and taking responsibility to tell the real story! If you want to know what really transpired, then this is the best source out there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Wasn't thrilled with the format but definitly got more interesting further into the book. I kind of predicted the ending.
1423140605|5.0|I loved this book. Our little heroes are growing up! It's nice to see them starting to understand that it's not all about them (as individuals). A little humility can go a long way. (I love, love, love that Percy and Jason NEED help to accomplish their goals.) The only thing I am displeased about, where this series is concerned, is the fact that I must wait until FALL 2013 for BOOK FOUR! I can't wait!
B008BM9L72|5.0|Fifty shades trilogy is a fantastic book and I can't wait for the movie to come out. There has to be a movie. This book has brought my husband and I closer together and we have rekindled a lot in our relationship. Thank you to the author for a book well worth the money spent and can't wait for her next book to hit the shelves. You just keep them coming and I'll keep on buying.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was annoyed that I was not able to walk away from this miserable story. Neither of the protagonists is in the least bit likeable  nor sympathetic.

0385344333|2.0|This is a marginal book at best.  The fact that it is a \\"Lee Child\\" book makes it worse, but since he's kind of sold out his fans already, I dont know why I was surprised. The entire premise of Reacher's involvement is weaker than ever.  I realize that it is probably getting hard for him to just fall into trouble, but surely this was beyond most reader's implausibility threshold. The writing is superficial, the story is implausible, the entire scenario (or two) just defied logic and believability.  I know these books are escapism and that we often just need to follow Reacher, and watch what happens, but this one...I just dont know how else to say it. Poorly contrived, weak, implausible, ...it felt like Child was just churning one out to meet a quota or something. The whole fake nuke waste as currency, govt holding pen/ motel, the waitress/contact that no one knew about...seriously? I kept waiting for Reacher's unknown twin to show up or aliens or Bigfoot...it was just that bad.<br />Yes, I realize that I am probably more disappointed than I would be if it was an unknown author or a new series, but this was junk. The original set up...him in the car...STUPID.

B008XFAT7S|4.0|Pure martial arts pleasure. Short on complex dialog but long on choreographed fight scenes. This foreign movie is acceptably shot and nicely directed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Every American should read this book!  If for no other reason but to learn the dedication it takes to be in our Special Forces!  Well written--I certainly found no \\"secrets\\" that would put our Country in peril, as was reported in the media when the book was released.
0525953728|5.0|I thought the discussion regarding the Green Team selection process was interesting, and I am glad he picked up here rather than describing his experience with BUDS training.<br /><br />I am surprised he is sitting in the hot seat regarding this book.  It seems very standard as far as the narrative and amount of information given when compared to other Navy Seal/Sniper books I have read.<br /><br />Good read.  I would recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|I loved the trilogy, would read more if they are written. When I got done with the third and last one I realized I had just read a fairy tale not a fiction, I do not believe anyone has sex that many times and still wants more, but then again I have never been wealthy and had time on my hands. But the story even with all the sex was good. I would read them again and I would recommend this to anyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I wad late getting on the pinterest bandwagon,  but am I so glad I did!  My boyfriends mom got me started and I have enjoyed every moment since!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Great movie adaptation of the classic Grinch. Jim Carrey and others made it fun and enjoyable to watch. One of the better Holiday movies.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|What a great movie.  The cd worked very well with no problems.  One of the best movies around.  I hope you enjoy.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|Not the best in the Resident Evil series, but still a great movie and great cast. Milla as Alice kicking infected ass again.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|Truly laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.  Well worth watching over and over.  Such a fan of \\"Bridge\\"
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I had always wished for a couple more Spaceballs movies. Mel Brooks made some great films but this might have been my favorite. Nice having an updated version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love Pinterest..It  has led me to more creative ideas than I ever had before.I am HOOKED!! Thank you, Kbfini
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Great movie with outstanding memorable lines. Used this for inspiration for a man's life celebration. Also learned a lot about the game of baseball I didn't know before.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good read. Thought provoking ending though somewhat disturbing, a page turner for sure. I'm left wondering why Jacob's mom did what she did in light of the fact that she thought the confession/ suicide was for real?
0345803485|3.0|I got pulled in with the hype of the book and listening to a few others who'd also started reading the book. What happened along the way was a journey into disappointment. Starting with Ana's insistance on persuing Christian after he told her he was not the man for her but she was so infatuated with him that nothing could change her mind. Even after this 'gorgeous man' explains the facts of his lifestyle to her and submits a contract to her to sign listing his expectations she still doesn't stop. Okaaay...Sexy? Yes, at the start of the relationship but after awhile the dialogue gets to be annoying. Ana has an inner goddess who's a bit of a gymnast with an attitude and eyeglasses and she reacts to many of Ana's insecurities and is explicit when she's aroused (she's the fun one in this story)which is often. What I don't get is when exactly was the writer going to let Ana grow up? She pouts all through the story. She's a college grad who lives with a friend who is sexually active yet Ana's clueless which is something 'best friends' do talk about. At any rate when Christian gives Ana gifts he practically has to force it on her, a new cell, a car, a laptop because she doesn't want to feel like a prostitute by trading sex for 'things'. Geeez this girl is just that,a girl. After getting the laptop the two started sending emails to the point of it being annoying. He probably shouldn't have given her the laptop after all. The writer could have expanded on her characters and their relationship or anything else. Instead, they bicker, send emails, Ana chews her lip and they send emails for several more pages of every chapter and Ana chews her lip and the bicker, send emails and na chews her lip. When they're alone she has an orgasm just looking at 'Christian the beautiful'. Eventually the story gets kind of repetative and nearly stalls until the next sexcapade. the whole thing could have been written in an adult way and made more interesting but as it stands it is almost juvenile in the way the characters interact. She's so insecure all she thinks about is why does this beautiful man want her? Well, she's exactly the type abusers look for. And technically he is an abuser. But that's another story. This book may be a reason why I don't read romance novels. But romantic erotica is supposed to be adult material and this is not. Get rid of some overused stuff like 'Ana's lip biting' and 'oh my' or 'murmured' or the many shades of crimson this girl turns every single time 50 shades even thinks of glancing her way. Ana needs to put on her big girl panties and realize she's not in Wonder Land anymore. Hope that happens in her next adventure. Don't be discouraged E.L. the next one will only get better!<br />And for heaven's sakes, please stop emailing and add in more interesting stuff to keep the readers happy and interested. This book could have been a monster...meant in a good way!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|All first season episodes of a great show. Negative is you have to fast forward through all the introductions and advertisements.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|I must admit that when I read reviews that said the book was \\"suitable for all ages\\" I was sceptical. However, it truly is! Even though it is not overly sophisticated, it is enjoyable, interesting and beautifully written (as all of Dawkins' work is). I couldn't put it down!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have never had a problem with this app. I like it better on my kindle then I do on my laptop.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book really deserves 5 stars, holding your attention until 3/4ths of the way through. The end was hard to hang on to. Thanks for writing this book.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|The author asks a great question, and then methodically takes you through the steps toward the answer; with many other questions and answers between.  Simplistic and logical conclusions supported by research.  Well-written and easy to read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the only flaw would be the coin regeneration time. you lose them way faster than you gain them. other than that it's absolutely perfect.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|Steven Wilson is a genius in his own right.The man is constantly working.With his own bands,to mixing,producing etc...The man has saved Rock and Roll for me.I own just about everything he creates,or is a part of.I listened to E.L.P.,King Crimson and many prog.band over the years.For Steven to come along,and not only make great music of his own with Porcupine Tree,Blackfield,No-Man,and his solo work throughout the last 20 years.He takes music that I love,and makes it better.If that's possible you say.Yes it certainly is.Don't think twice about this one.I have the original version,the gold Ultradisc version,of course Vinyl,Cassette,and 8 Track.This is the cream of the crop.Tarkus,and Pictures at an Exhibition for me are their best.I love ELP 1,and Trilogy,as well as Brain Salad Surgery.Tarkus is E.L.P.'s masterpiece for sure,and Mr.Wilson just made it a grand masterpiece.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love Reacher!  I keep waiting for a dud but all Lee Child's Reacher books are on my must have list!  They explode with action and I am never,ever disappointed!<br /><br />We buy all our books for our Kindle Readers at Amazon.com
B009329ZF2|5.0|This item is probably not ever going to have critical acclaim, but I found it to be fun, entertaining, and, when it was over, I had a smile on my face.
0316228532|4.0|Great book! I preordered it. Not Harry Potter but still great storytelling by a genius!<br /><br />thanks we have been waiting for something else!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this version.  I play several games to relax before going to bed.  Not only is it fun, but truly holds your interest. If I were asked to give it up my answer is \\"NEVER\\".
B005UBNKWO|4.0|This processor performs well and overclocks easily and never gets overly warm. No problems, worked fine. For gaming I prefer the FX4170.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|And add 5 extra stars to my rating.<br />The second part of Follet's great Trilogy follows existing characters plus new ones from Post Great War years until the early 1950's.<br />In Germany we watch Hitler's rise to absolute power and the subsequent horrors. Stalin consolidates his power in Soviet Russia,<br />Roosevelt starts his New Deal. Back in Europe Mosley's Fascists gain many members and attempt a march on London's East End.<br />Nazi Germany grows its armed forces while Chamberlain and Daladier prevaricate and we join Welsh miners when they fight in the Spanish Civil War and encounter Russian treachery.<br />Thus is the stage set for WW2 and The Cold War and we follow both to conclusion.<br />Here we have yet another great epic from Ken Follett which I cannot praise highly enough! I eagerly await the third novel in this Trilogy.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I haven't used some of the abilities, but it works good for keeping things on hand, no matter where I am, or what computer I use.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I must admit, this book kept my interest AND kept me guessing because I didn't expect it to go in the direction it did.  I could've done without all the technical mumbo jumbo about why the town was what it was, but the premise was actually quite creepy to consider.  I loved Ethan and was rooting for him the whole way, but I can't decide if I was disappointed in the decision he ultimately made. And what an awesome price for a full length book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a fun site, lots of recipes, crafts, lots of ideas from other people.  You can set up your own area to pin the items you want.
B001IF252M|1.0|I bought this one. It works fine to connect my laptop (running win7) to monitors. But it doesn't work with the projectors. It seems it is slightly different from the  general adapter. If you are using apple's products, I recommend this one, but if you want to connect PC to projectors, don't buy it.

Wonderful show...movie quality...new faces...talented...original new spin. The teenparts are mature...not over done val girl. I say go for it ...any age.
0307959856|4.0|Just finished the utterly charming \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" by P.D. James. I don't know how it has happened that I've never read any of James's novels, and this, a departure from her Brit mysteries, is my first. My excuse is in the category of too-many-books-too-little-time.  I'll be reading more.<br /><br />I was surprised to see some negative reviews because I found the book so enjoyable. Perhaps others are comparing it to others written \\"in the tradition of\\", and since I've read no others in this niche, I bow to their expertise. But I came to the book based on the title, the carriage on the cover, the well known author, and the book blurb, with few expectations except that the book would be well written--as it is. But it is also a lot of fun. There are witticisms that could have come from Jane's pen. I enjoyed going back to visit Elizabeth and Darcy. James channels Austen's voice and the plot is fun - Wickham and Lydia are the troublemakers Mr. Bennet predicted. The characters have grown and changed, but they are still our old friends.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who was sad when \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" ended and cried over \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".
143911000X|5.0|This book is a good for getting in a few laughs and I've actually found myself quoting a few things out of it. It is a very good price for what you get.
B0079IEPHA|4.0|This show is fantastic and I'd give it a 4 except that the video quality is horrible. They need a Blu ray version of this.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I recieved the movie (The Hunger Games) in a very timely manner.The DVD was however defective ( Not their fault)and they did send a return mailer right out. But the wait I had encountered for my refund was longer than should be,again they did try to make up for that.
0316228532|1.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  When I bought this book I did it with the understanding that it would be nothing like Harry Potter.  If I had known about the overabundance of swearing I never would have picked it up. For example, Chapter 2 is less than 4 pages long and contains the F word five times.  A little swearing is acceptable for effect, but it was obvious that it would only get worse.  Needless to say I put the book down. If I could I would return it for a refund. Too bad that she alienated her audience with unneccessary language this way.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A gripping first hand account of a Navy Seal. The training they undergo, their sheer endurance and the selfless sacrifices they make is unbelievable.A worthy read I would say.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|I enjoyed this book.. it provided a great escape back to a simpler time when the world was not in such a hurry. I enjoyed all the ancient nautical terminology. The world was a bigger place in this time period. you will find yourself transported tot he deck of the HMS Sophie as she hunts prize after prize across the oceans of the world. Lucky Jack Aubrey is an action hero by any definition, and in any age. You will also enjoy the parallels to modern times as Jack deals with Bureaucracy and must manipulate and work the system to get the equipment and supplies he needs to remain at sea.<br /><br />This novel although lengthy, paints a very accurate picture of the time and place, as well as the attitudes of both Lucky Jack and his crew, I enjoyed seeing through the eyes of Dr.Maturin, also truly uninitiated into this seafaring world, and learning with him the names of all of the parts of the ship, different types of ships as well as all the Naval jargon of the time.<br /><br />If you saw the movie \\"Master and Commander the far side of the world\\" then you WILL enjoy this novel. The price is fair as the novel is quite long.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I have watched season 1 several times.  It is very well written and the acting is great.  I love this modern take on Sherlock.  Fantastic!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love the dozer games at the fair .. this works just like that .. it generates coins so I never spend my own money to play
B00170MYIS|1.0|I've had this battery for over a month and it has repeatedly died after very limited use. When it's freshly charged and I power up the camera will report something like 118 minutes of life. Then, it will start rapidly dropping in large increments until suddenly it dies. Seems to be worse when using video. Sometimes the camera doesn't register that the battery is even there - not sure if that's a battery or camera issue.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love this book.  Defiantly takes me from my couch, to a far off world. Can't wait to read them all.
B008XNPO20|4.0|The music here is great. If you liked Innerspeaker, you'll like this, and vice versa. I think it's one of the best albums of 2012.<br /><br />I ordered the vinyl version and was disappointed in the quality. My second record is warped and it has a lot of surface noise that I doubt I'll be able to get rid of. Unlike most new music coming out on vinyl, this does not come with free mp3 downloads, so I either have to buy the music twice, rip the vinyl to mp3 with all of its frustrating imperfections, or obtain the mp3s through other means. I really wish I would have just saved my money and purchased the mp3 version from the start.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent game. Has the perfect combination of fun and challenge.  Not too hard and not too easy. I highly recommend this game. Cannot wait for more!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesomeness this book is for an  older audience but it is intense graphic and generally a good story line and writing style
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Having read all Reacher novels to-date this was the slowest read yet, could not wait to finish and move on to a different novel....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun I love this so much its like little games in one set!!!!!!!! love love love love love love this games soooooooooooo much
B006Z4LOPK|4.0|The first season was the best yet and I didn't care for the second season as much as the first but hope when it comes back we will see more of the kin of seens in the first season.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the trilogy! I absolutely hated for the last book to end. I understood that these were for young adults. I am 64yrs. young and loved them.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|aVia Media Player worked great on mp4, avi's and mkv so far, let's hope it keeps working with no problems on my Toshiba Thrive android based tablet.
B009HSVHV2|2.0|I have listen to this album with the upmost open mind and not one track has stuck in my head. I have heard this type of generic \\"KISS\\" rock during their more unpopular years in the 80'S and 90'S. To regain that classic \\"KISS\\" music you have to regain that classic \\"KISS\\" sound and it's just not here. I was a die hard fan in the 70'S and to me \\"SONIC BOOM\\" was much much closer to that classic \\"KISS\\" sound than \\"MONSTER\\" is. Very disapointed after all the hype!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all three books. At times I couldn't put it down.  A little repetitive in spots however following the love story between Anastasia and Christian was exciting.  I wish it didn't have to end and hope E.L. James can bring them back to us in the near future as I certainly think with all his ex-subs there would be plenty of story line.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Fall of Giants is a fascinating look at history through the eyes of the people who lived it.  Mr Follett writes the novel after obviously intensive research to be sure historical facts are accurate, then puts a face on the consequences of the results of war by including people who lived it, giving insight into the different cultures involved from the English, German, and Communist point of view.  I highly recommend this compelling read.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Like Pillars of the Earth, this book is so rich with historical information interwoven with a beautiful story. Follett has paid a lot of attention to getting the history right and that raises the storylines of the characters to a great level.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Now that i have the entire album i know play some nights every single day this album is awesome and every s.ingle song on here should of been a hit.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game it is so fun. The only complaint I have is it is hard to get answers to your questions about the game.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is one of the most charming, albeit a bit clumsy heroes I've run across in many years of reading thriller/action novels. Lee Child has a way of presenting Reacher to the readers so we see inside him. As always he's fleeing unknown adversaries in this story that goes into the past to show us a younger Reacher. We can't help but like this man who sometimes appears not to know what he's doing, but he gets his job done anyway.[[ASIN:B00738WMSU Wolf Song]]
B003O86FMW|5.0|I lived this becoming because it kept you interested. i kept wanting to read so i could find out what happened next! it was amazing!

B007ZD17XO|4.0|Very entertaining, although I admit being slow to catch on to what's going on . I will keep at it. Try it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I knew someone would go missing from the title but never expected this!  Edge of your seat-who?who?who?  Good story line, good background info on characters.  Definitely recommend.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a great movie to have in your collection.  In a hurry to have series 3 to come on PBS.  Anyone who watched the series would want this copy.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved the movie almost as much as the book ! I read the book earlier this year and had a pretty specific image of the characters in my head.  To my delight, the actors and actresses were cast perfectly. I actually remember thinking Judi Dench would have played a perfect Evelyn.  Don't miss this delightful film !
0345803493|1.0|I just can't, in good conscience, not add my one-star to the pool of reviews. Here's hoping the one-stars will take over here as they are for the first book. Writing this bad must be addressed.<br /><br />It's time to stop the hype.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The best office suite for Android. It is a full function office suite that works great on my Droid 2 Global and on my Arnova 10b G3.
0345803485|1.0|Seriously... How? Why? I just don't understand. I really don't. How can anyone like this book? No plot, sophomoric (more like juvenile) writing, unlikeable/unrealistic characters, boring, boring, boring... what am I missing?<br /><br />To be honest, I am only writing a review to add to the one-star count. The balance is still off, more five-star (!!!) than one. We need to tip the scales so the overall rating will go down and no more unsuspecting bibliophiles will get suckered out of $10.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book. It was interesting to see how people so twisted and ruined by the system can try to make love work. It just shows that things that happen to young adults or kids really do hinder them in most decisions they make later in life. Even though it's fiction, we know things happen in real life.
0345803507|1.0|If you're reading these reviews after experiencing profound sadness that not one but three (!!!) books of this absolute garbage have been published and lauded then please leave a one-star review. We need to shift the balance before the overall score (4 stars!) swindles more of our fellow book-lovers out of their hard-earned money.
B0042P5KNQ|5.0|This book came and was just lovely. It was advertized accurately and I already am enjoying its wonderful message! I was concerned that it was not a hardback copy but the cover it lovely!
B004QL7K6Q|4.0|Wanderlust was a surprisingly hilarious movie.  I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I felt it was a decent movie...if anything.  The difference with this movie(as is with several others...) is the more you watch it....THE FUNNIER IT GETS.<br />I noticed a lot of movies lately become cult favorites...BECAUSE people watch it again and again.  Paul Rudd is CLASSIC in this movie and Jen Anniston...though not as great as HORRIBLE BOSSES...still puts in a good performance.  I purchased this movie only because I can't stop watching it! I recommend this movie to anyone who likes hilarious dialogue and crazy situations that the characters are forced into.
B001O3SSWY|5.0|Oh my God what a good movie! I was doing research on Amon Goeth, when I ran across this term while reading \\"As he is also depicted in Schindler's List\\". And All can say is Holy S@#T!<br />The performance of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes is just marvelous. And not to mention A fantastic score(soundtrack)as well.
0385344333|2.0|Love Lee Child, love the Jack Reacher character.  Didn't love this book.  I read it to the end, and enjoyed being in the Jack Reacher universe for a while, but I wished the story had moved along a bit more.  I didn't get the bad guys.  And I really didn't get the travel dimensions.  Back and forth and back and forth, finally I just didn't care where they were, just finish the story!  Not the best, but better than nothing.
B002EXI5L2|5.0|This is a funny, wonderful movie in the classic Doris Day style.  She is outstanding and Rock Hudson is superb.  Pop some popcorn, pour a glass of wine, and curl up for some great Doris Day comedy.
044024630X|4.0|This was fun to catch up on Reacher's past.  I loved the explanations of all the weird quicks his character has.  But the story had a problem in that Devereaux's reactions to the EXTREME violence in her little town was so understated.  Didn't seem right.  You would think that she would freak out just a bit, even being the Sheriff, just a smidge of a freak-out.  That's basically my only criticism of this book.  Oh, maybe could have used just a bit more conversation with Garber and Nealey, because we love them from past books.  Good story, just marches along.
B000000XB9|5.0|I bought this one before and i lost it I&#34;m sure glad that i could find it again.I love this cd.Thank you for being really prompt,
B001LM1456|5.0|I think this movie was nicely done. Our whole family enjoyed it. In fact, some of the family have watched it several times since it arrived.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|really awesome for when you have nothing else in the world to do. especially at three in the morning. on a Tuesday.
0525953728|5.0|It was very interesting to know more about our Seals.<br />I have a grandson who served on the Carl Vinson<br />Air craft carrier during the Kwait incident and I<br />fully respect and support all of our Military.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I enjoyed this book almost as much as the first book, looking forward to book 3 next. i would recommend.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I can't give a 3.5 rating, so after some serious thought, I'm giving this a 3.<br /><br />BEWARE POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br /><br />I first heard of this book a few years back, but didn't bother reading it. Then, last month, I saw the trailer for the Ang Lee movie, and thought it really beautiful (at least for the scenery!). That coupled with some friends highly recommending the book, I bought it and I read it.<br /><br />I did not like it.<br /><br />It started out quite well. The story itself was good too, I'll give it that. But, I didn't like how it ended in such an abrupt way.<br /><br />So the way the story goes, is this author wanted to write a book and someone had told him to look for someone else because he had a story that would make you 'believe in god'. OK. Fine. So with that whole story out there - and after, the ending was just a report on how the shik sunk. That's the great wrap up? The book name IS the LIFE of Pi, not A STORY of Pi...<br /><br />Maybe I'm like Pi himself, who needs a grand and symbolic ending, so I really disliked the ending of the book. Or I'm just stubborn.<br /><br />A few things to note (more spoilers)<br />- I will have to agree that the \\"first story\\" is a lot better than the \\"second story\\" without the animals.<br />- I got very confused, very, very confused indeed when Pi went blind and was either hallucinating or whatever that it was...<br />- however improbable, I liked the idea of that meerkat island
B009CPEOC4|4.0|I was very surprised by this movie, I have a new respect for the pop star. Good for a documentary.
0385344333|5.0|I haven't finished the novel yet, but I am so caught up in the suspense I'm cheating, stealing time to read, but I am confused by all the negative reviews.  This is the best Reacher book yet and shows off Child's skills as a writer of economical, yet evokative prose and as a story teller of great thrillers.  Reacher is wandering through a post-modern landscape of a forgotten middle America as he winds his way to Virginia, encountering violence, deceit, sex, and characters with yearnings of greatness, both good and bad.  Yes, the books are formulaic.  Jack will encounter and strong woman, law enforcement officer ususally, who will share the case and his bed.  He will engage in direct combat, leaving damaged bodies.  He will rescue  some weaker elements of the community, a good guy like Sheriff Goodman will be injuried in the process.  The characters are also stock characters.  The eyewitness, a flawed drunk, similar to the doctor in the previous novel.  Reacher's anoying predilection for facts.  The area codes for Kansas city, the populations of towns.  But the context of the stories, the bleak and flawed American landscapes of despair and desperation and the plots redemn the flaws.  Each character has his own ticks that make them different from a previous one.  The strong woman cop is always slightly different in physical appearance and motivation than her predecessor.  The seduction scene is different.  No trains this time.  And reacher buys the same underwear and blue shirts and jeans in the same convenience stores for ever.  But it works and I am amazed at how competently Child's has mastered his material in constructing a complex plot  and the dual chapters with which he begins paralleling Sorenson's uncovering of the case with Reacher's real time involvement with the culprits, that I haven't been able to solve yet and control his scenes with that marvelous flat economical and yet descriptive prose.

B005LAIHHC|1.0|I watch just about everything. This is one of the worst movies I have come across in a couple of years. It just didn't comparing to the previous movie. Was hoping to like this on some level. Turned it of 35 minutes in.

1609611543|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I learned so much about why our society is obese. I also learned why I can't quite get rid of this flab that came out of nowhere and landed around my own middle.  I will definitely take Dr. Davis' advice to not only cut out the wheat that is so prevalent in my diet, but also all of the surgary, processed snacks.  Of course, in the back of our collective minds we know that kind of stuff isn't good for us.  But, when you have it all laid out for you, celiac disease, digestive problems, diabetes, arthritis, dementia, obesity.................I personally would rather be armed with the knowledge to prevent all of those things from settling in on me than to contract them and then try to figure out how to get out of them.  Thanks, Dr. Davis!!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Most knives you see in any shop or on the internet are pale imitations of what a real knife should be...then there are the other 1%...a blade meant to be worked...hard. A blade so thick and so well built it makes you feel like whacking a piece of rebar in half is possible...i wouldn't, but it doesn't frighten me, not with this knife.<br />It's not a show piece...the finish won't dazzle you...it doesn't have a hollow handle to store crap in, it doesn't have a plastic 5cent compass, it is however the one knife i want on my belt if ever i were in trouble.<br />It feels like a full foot of steel cut from a trucks leaf spring. If your house burned to the ground you could sift through the rubble, wipe the soot off, and re-sheath it...it's just that good. (i know the heat would make it brittle...just sayin)<br />This kind of knife is one that becomes legendary, 20 years from now people will hear about this or actually hold one and word will spread...tales will be told...<br />It doesn't have the edge of a scalpel, but out of the box it's sharp. Put whatever edge you want on it, but you'll need a diamond surface to cut it, once it has an edge i can't imagine what would dull it...this is tough, thick steel.<br />The first 30 minutes after opening the box were filled with admiration and curse words to describe how hardcore this thing is. In the description i used; Brutish, Medieval, and Hardcore...and i meant just that. I would carry this thing through any jungle, any mountain side, any hostile environment in the world without a second thought.<br />I would have paid three times the 36 dollars i paid for it and still felt i got a great deal on a great blade.<br /><br />Update 1;<br />Today was a minor test of the knife. The weight of the blade led me first to chopping wood, in 30 seconds and without effort i cut through an untreated 2x4. Next was a low hanging branch on a live oak that has needed trimming for some time. I chopped my way through a 4\\" branch in moments, except for the awkward reach for the branch the knife went through it like a sharp axe...again, with very little effort. The success of these tests i atribute to the heft/weight of the blade, not the edge so much.<br />The butt of the knife made quick work of the hollow section of a cinder block, clearing a 3\\" hole in just two minutes.<br />By the end of my efforts to gauge the heartiness of this knife it cleaned up without any permanent marks or visible damage, as i suspected. The blade won't need sharpening as a result of the work it did.for the awkward reach for the branch the knife went through it like a sharp axe...again, with very little effort.

B0031RSBS2|5.0|I cannot say that i have had even a minutes disappointment since reading the first of the Lee child's Jack Reacher books. I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one up to the current number 13 that I am reading now. I know these books are coming on the big screen but in my mind as I am reading about Reacher I see Aussie Chris Hemsworth as the perfect man to be Reacher

0525952616|3.0|I was looking for a good techno-thriller and bought this book after reading its review in one of the magazines. On the positive side, it does describe the current status of drone warfare and projects where it could be taken.  It is also a page turner. However, on the negative side, I found that there were many loose ends that were not tied properly. Also, toward the end, the plot line moved from being far fetched, but possible, to impossible.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I didn't watch Homeland Season 1 when it aired on Showtime.  I bought the DVD set when it came out.  I had heard a lot about the show and wanted to check it out.  I was hooked after the first episode, and it kept getting better and better! The acting is phenomenal; Claire Danes is so good in this!  I was a fan of 24, but Homeland is way beyond it!  I am now a faithful viewer of Season 2 on Showtime.
0545310601|4.0|I have read critiques and heard comments from friends and family that this is the weakest of the three books in the Hunger Games series.  Personally, I had to force myself not to skip to the end to find out what happened.  I was so caught up in this exciting tale that the suspense was almost unbearable.  I will admit I found some of the reading tedious, maybe because of so much repetition, or maybe it was just because I wanted to reach the climax.  There were questions I wanted answered:  Will the rebels of the districts attacking the capital be able to overthrown the oppressive President Snow?  Will Katniss get her promised prize of assassinating the President?  Who will Katniss chose, Gale or Peeta?  What will their future be?  As a side note, I have heard many comment on whether these books are a look into our own country's future.  Author Collins probably heard that speculation to, so she  gives us a section to ponder when she writes, \\"Frankly, our ancestors don't seem much to brag about.  I mean, look at the state they left us in, with the wars and the broken planet.  Clearly, they didn't care about what would happen to the people who came after them.\\"  Is that an admonishing warning or what?  Anyway, at the conclusion, all questions are answered and the future laid out for us.  I have to say this is the best trilogy I have ever read.  I can't wait until my granddaughters are old enough to read it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful followup to season 1. Eagerly await the next season. Tempted to buy the entire seasons as this feels very much a re-watchable series. Excellent writing and cast selection. Just Perfect for a 'period piece.
0439023491|4.0|At the end of the thoroughly enjoyable first book in the Hunger Game series, everything was tied up in a neat bow.  All the questions were answered, all the personal conflicts resolved.  The motivation to read the second book, \\"Catching Fire,\\" was the desire to learn more about the characters as their lives continue.  The heroine: Katniss; the men, actually boys, in her life: Gale and Peeta; Katniss' family.  And beyond that, what might be the fate of the country Panem, formerly the United States of America.  The country now consists of 12 districts and the Capital, which is strategically located in the Rocky Mountains to prevent attack from the other districts, the population of which is totally subjugated to the whims of President Snow.  The victory tour from the most recent Hunger Games is over, and Katniss, the dual victor along with Peeta, finds herself raised to the status of national hero, and apparently an inspiration to the 12 Districts to revolt.  To counter that, Snow sets up another round of Hunger Games, this time involving all former winners.  So, back into the area to face more diabolical challenges go Katniss, Peeta, and many others.  There is a profusion of characters, but so well drawn that it is not difficult to keep them clear.  Why only four stars?  This book does not end like the first.  It kind of just stops with lots of unanswered questions and Katniss and Peeta in limbo.  Of course, now it becomes necessary to read the third installment.  This is an engrossing literary journey.
B009FOBZL0|3.0|The current music landscape has seen a number of compelling new albums from the likes of Dave Matthews Band, The Killers, and Muse.  Unfortunately, The Wallflowers were not able to join this group.  While Glad All Over is not a bad album, there isn't much that vies for attention.  I don't know if it was the decision to work with Mick Jones of the Clash or something bigger, but this just doesn't seem like The Wallflowers to me.  I thought the best two songs on the album were the urgent \\"It's A Dream\\" and the rather subdued \\"Love Is A Country\\".  However neither of these really stands up to previous albums by The Wallflowers or even Jakob Dylan's solo work either.  You may or may not agree.  However, if you are still on the fence about this album, I'll put it to you in simple terms.  If you like the first single \\"Reboot The Mission\\" or \\"Misfits And Lovers\\", you'll probably like Glad All Over.  If you don't, you'll probably want to pass.  It's not that the music is bad per se, but it does little to grab my attention and fight to keep it.<br /><br />Download this:  It's A Dream
B0098VXBIA|2.0|I wasn't expecting Academy Award level entertainment or anything, but this one was a disappointment. Just not really funny or even cute enough to call it a good rom com. And it seemed long - maybe due to lack of many laughs. The Dad's group was the cutest part. Wanted to like it more, but just didn't.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|A well-written and interesting Reacher, but without the usual suspense and sexual situations.  there was not as much action and many paragraphs of description of highway and flat, endless geography.  In my opinion, not the best Reacher but still a good read.
B009329ZF2|2.0|This movie may well become a cult classic.  I watched- no endured it, and then found myself talking about it for the next week.<br />The first 15 minutes were genuinely funny, I completely enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but as it continued, I was amazed at just how bad it got.<br />The acting was so bad, that they should give Oscar's to the actors for their impersonation of actors.<br />The scene where the disabled vet asks the girlfriend, \\"How good are your driving skills?\\" made me laugh out loud for days, but I don't think it was meant to be funny.<br />And, Rhianna just wasn't credible as a military weapons specialist...<br /><br />But having said all of that, I am now thinking I should watch it again... and I will say that the SFX were definitely impressive, but as a previous reviewer said, you can't allow yourself to think when watching this movie, or it will most definitely ruin any possibilty for enjoyment.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I may be dense but it took me awhile before I realized that what I was looking at were the 7 dwarfs. But I have to say that the movie was good  and kept your attention.

Note: the bonus track sound like it will be one of the best of the record i am planing on buying in itunes.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Ok, this is not a perfect book, but I don't care.  It was clever and smart.  I did indeed find it unputdownable, and for a summer read, that's all I need. But I don't want to trivialize the book, it was better than that.  The author showed some pretty psychologically astute thinking about childhood and marriage and the plot twists kept me going.  Realistic?  Of course not.  A great read?  You betcha.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I'm pretty irritated that in order to get all the supplemental materials available I was forced to pay the extra money for this 3D collector's edition.  I do not own, nor do I plan to purchase a 3D capable player or television.  I was forced to buy something I would not be able to use so that I could get bonus materials that should have been included in the non-3D blu-ray release.  I guess this is the business model of the future, being - not quite FORCED but definitely ENCOURAGED to upgrade to the latest and greatest.  I really feel bad for anyone who hasn't made the upgrade to blu-ray yet, boy, did you poor DVD only folks get screwed on this release - big time.  Shame on you 20th century fox, shame.  I don't know if anyone out there would be interested in purchasing the 3D movie-only disk portion of this set by itself, but as soon as I am able to list it for sale I'm going to see if I get any bites.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoyed this game in the beginning. I can even deal with the gradual slower pace of game. But,  what I can 't tolerate are the glitches.

B008JFC6F0|4.0|As far as debut albums go, they don't tend to come much stronger than Tame Impala's \\"Innerspeaker\\". That LP's hypnotic grooves and translucent melodies were as addictive to listen to as the drugs that probably inspired there creation and frontman/creative hub Kevin Parker channelled the ghost of John Lennon on their first full length better than anybody since ... I dunno Liam Gallagher on Definitely Maybe? Anyway, two years on from the remarkably psychedelic \\"Innerspeaker\\" and we have their eagerly awaited follow up \\"Lonerism\\" to feast over. The differences between \\"Lonerism\\" and \\"Innerspeaker\\" aren't as numerous as their similarities, the fat snare pulses, fuzzy lo-fi guitar, smooth bass and dreamy vocals that were the predominant components of their first album, are featured heavily on this one and the style they sport here is still very reminscent of late 60's psych rock. However; the extra reliance on synthesizsers, increased studio experimentation and the handful of songs on \\"Lonerism\\" with a nonlinear song structure, certainly distinguish this album from it's predecessor and come to think of it, pretty much anything else thats being made right now under the rock idiom.<br /><br />Opener \\"Be above it\\" brings a whole new meaning to the word space rock, with its alien overdubs and stomping drums sounding like the bands namesake marching through the expanses of mars, whilst blowing a flurry of liquid bubbles. Introductions to what's essentially a pop record, are rarely this audacious and it's this mixture of experimentation and joyful meldiousness that come to define the whole album. \\"Endors Toi\\" takes inspiration from the weightlessness of Boards of Canada's \\"dayvan cowboy\\". It's glistening keyboards, instrumental interplay, and washes of electronica all sublimely coalesce here, before a raucous guitar riff ratchets up the intensity. Aptly tiitled \\"Apocolypse Dreams\\" features scintillatingly sustained piano and some ominous Pink Floyd-y breakdrowns all coated ina mass of phil spector-esque reverbarations. The euphoria driven stoner rock of \\"Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control\\" feels like an utterly transformative, truly out of this world experience. with Avalanches style conversations, ecstatic drumming, bright synths and Kevin Parkers echoed vocals all coming together to create a blissful wall of effervescent sound.<br /><br />Kevin Parkers theme of loneliness (hence the title) doesn't really come accross in any overt way on this album, except maybe in some of the song titles and the lyrics which the latter are difficult to decipher with the ever present maelstrom of sound seemingly drowning them out. However the elegiac closer \\"Suns Coming Up\\" shines a momentary spotlight on Parker's feelings of isolation and despondacy, with lyrics alluding to a failed relationship and a terminally ill father. I'm sure you've heard more than a handful of people claiming \\"Lonerism\\" as the de facto rock album of 2012 and in truth i'm edging closer to such an endorsement with every listen. Suffice to say Tame Impala have definitely produced something special here, by magically ressurecting the ecstasy of 60's psychedelia and infusing it with panaromic digital effects that add to it's appeal instead of detracting from it. Fans of Caribou, Of Montreal and Django Django should find listening to this something a kin to entering into a state of nirvana, everybodyelse should also have a pretty amazing time too;)
030758836X|3.0|I actually checked this book out on my kindle from my local library instead of buying it, and I am glad that I did.  The book was riveting nearly all the way through, but then toward the end just started to flop.  It became utterly uninteresting, and the final pages were so boring that it felt like the end of a term paper that just needed to be finished so that the author could go to sleep.  This could've been a knock-out, an unbelievable and memorable novel, but the last bit just made it feel like a waste of time.
B007UR1OHO|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that \\"The Vow\\" is not a prime example of cinematic genius or anything, but I think most viewers who choose to watch it will get out of it what they want- an inspiring love story with two good-looking actors and some very romantic and sad scenes.<br /><br />The story follows Leo (played by Channing Tatum) who has a whirlwind romance with Paige (Rachel McAdams). In a freak winter accident, Paige flies through the windshield of a car and wakes from a coma with the past five years of her life completely forgotten due to amnesia. She has no idea how her life has changed so dramatically from the time that she remembers, and she has no recollection of her love for Leo. Though discouraged by Paige's family and friends, Leo is determined to remind his wife how and why she fell in love with him.<br /><br />I thought the chemistry between the two central characters was great. Channing Tatum has come a long way from his Step Up years. While the concept was interesting, the true story of the couple the movie is based on- Kim and Krickitt Carpenter- is quite amazing and I recommend reading about them after watching this movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Fifty Shades was a view of Sadism/Masochism and after the first several sexual discriptions that pretty much was the story, ad infinitem.  Became boring and very poorly written, but we the public made this author wealthy.
1564029654|5.0|We don't own this book yet but my almost 4 years old daughter loves it. Her preschool teacher read this book on a first day of school. The concept: kids stay in school for a while without parents, but parents will always come back to pick them up (hint for parents: don't be late, your child will be waiting anxiously, especially if she will see other kids being picked up by their parents). While I thought like some other adults that this book might be scary all 20 children in her class seem to love it. And someone complained that \\"Story is kind of annoying with<br /><br />\\"...\\", said Percy<br /><br />\\"...\\", said Sarah<br /><br />\\"...\\", said Bill.\\"<br />That is repeated in the book few times. Well, repetition is very, very important for preschoolers. So they get the concept of the book and remember what it was about. My daughter \\"reads\\" books that she knows by herself. After we're done reading she sits with the book and says what she sees on the pictures and whatever she remembers from the story.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I found this book after reading 50 shades., and if you loved 50 shades then you know it's a hard book to get over.  I instantly fell in love with the characters and Loved this book!  Can't wait for the next one to come out, might even read it again while I wait.<br /><br />After I finished this book I read the providence trilogy by the same author..by far the best book I ever read!!!! Jamie is an amazing writer.  Worst part now is finding another series to fill the shoes of these books!

B0053O89Z6|4.0|I think all shows go through a stage where the original ideas are spent, and so many different story arcs have been tried and it either you wrap it up or try out new ideas that may or may not work.  I don't know why but as soon as Marshall's dad died the show dropped down a few levels in the funny department for me.  I still enjoyed the episodes but I felt some of its magic seemed absent from the party.  So this season I was hopping they could refill the glass as they worked towards the end of the show.  And they somewhat did, with Lily being pregnant it allowed for a new set of challenges for the cast to play off of.  Some of these moments were memorable, some didn't feel like the characters at all.  Depending on the episode I enjoyed the Barney and Quinn story.  I think what hurt the season the most was how many major story arcs were going on at once.  In the past even when Ted and Robin break up the focus is on Lily's wedding.  Kinda like a relay race of sorts in the past, were anything dominating in the story happened one at a time.  This season there is so much character evolution all around the story arcs went back in forth in ways that seemed unfocused and rushed.  I don't think the show was poorly written, but the diversity of characters which has been such a strength in the past has become an impossible task for the writers.  Since viewers love all the characters so much it must be hard as a writer managing all of them at this point of the series.  The first season you mainly had Ted, and every one around him with minor story lines.  The amount of original cometic situations in that formula was amazing.  If they wanted to they really could take a break from the story line and just have really funny and original story lines.  But now all jokes need to fit in between this mad dash to finish everyone off.  I personal couldn't write better episodes myself.  I, like the writers would want to give the viewers closure with every character before ending the show.  Thats what they are doing, and I'm fine with that.  I watched every episode gladly, and will of the next season.  Although not my favorite it was in no ways a disappointment.  If your a fan of the show you must watch this season or you will miss out of many great developments of the show.  Chris Elliott and Martin Short bring there own style to the performances.Thats what they are doing, and I'm fine with that.  I watched every episode gladly, and will of the next season.

B008G8SFGO|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I love Kiss; I have enjoyed and supported their music through all of the band's line ups and have respected all of the musicians that have been a part of the Kiss family. So this is not a review that is biased based on who is or is not in the band. Let me also state that Sonic Boom was a fantastic album that impressed the hell out of me and has become one of my favorite Kiss albums to date; but now on to Monster:<br /><br />  The first thing I noticed is that the album lacked the \\"Destroyer\\" type album cover that Paul Stanley said it would have. Instead, the album cover looks like something you would find in a discount CD rack in a record store. The cover truly looks like a cheap greatest hits or B-sides album; but hey, we're not going to be that shallow as to judge a book by it's cover here are we? I mean, the music will speak for its self, and that's what really matters most.<br /><br />  The music of Monster unfortunately keeps pace with it's B-sides album cover. It seems the band tried to go for a more watered down version of their Animalize/Asylum days and does so in a very uneventful way. Many of the songs feel forced, lack energy and sound like throw away songs that have been revamped in order to fill an album. There are a few decent tunes here, but for the most part, it feels like the band really ran out of steam on this one and couldn't quite get themselves to write a truly memorable song. And I really hate to say this; but Paul stanley's voice sounds a bit tired and strained on the trackes that he sings on. I am wondering if something was not working right and that is why Gene's songs seem to outnumber Paul's on this album. And all of Paul's songs sound like he didn't put much effort into them. Where is the Modern day delilah, Say yeah or Detroit rock city? It almost seems like Paul was absent on this album and Gene reverted back to the uninspired song writing of his Hollywood/ non-makeup days. I might also add that Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer had great tunes on Sonic Boom... and here they delivered a couple of uneventful fillers that had no heart whatsoever. The Tommy Thayer song is especially horrible and sounds like he is doing a bad Gene Simmons impression while singing.<br /><br />  I am not sure if this album should be a two and half star rating or three; and I can only hope that it will grow on me over time. As said above, there are a few decent tunes in the mix; but nothing really blew my hat off like Sonic Boom did on its very first listen. I am very sad to say this; but if this is the best Kiss can come up with these days; maybe it is time to start thinking about hanging up the spandex. I am greatly curious to see what other Kiss fans will say about this album. Sorry for the bad review Kiss family, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't hype this album into something it is not. I wish the band well and hope that if they make another album, it will tower over this one by miles. Monster was not at all what I expected.
B005LAJ1H2|1.0|The product could not be played on my dvd. I think the problem was due to regional codes. When a customer from Norway orders a dvd, i thought it was your duty to chek if the dvd could be played on dvd players in that country. I will not use Amazone again.<br /><br />Petter Meyer

006113127X|3.0|I finished this with a friend last night.  I think Bukowski needs to be read out loud to be fully enjoyed and this was an enjoyable read.  The main character reminds me so much of one of my brothers that I felt at home with him right away.<br /><br />Bukowski certainly falls down on a lot of fronts, but for raw stories of real life (if life on the margins), I think he gets it right.  This is only my second Bukowski book, having read \\"women\\" 20 years ago, but it was fun and I will probably be picking up more.
0385344333|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and found it to be very engaging - anytime Reacher is in a situation where he is hunting/being hunted is going to be good.  Looking forward to when he arrives in Virginia.
B00008J2PG|5.0|What a wonderful surprise this movie was.  Based on the true story of a catholic priest from Irleand named Father O'Flaherty.  He was a monsignor in the Vatican when the Nazi's invaded and occupied Rome.  He was responsible for the saving of thousands of lives at risk of his own life.  The story is a must see and has an incedible ending.  Any christian of any faith will want to see this movie, it is a courageous story.  Also Gregory Peck's BEST PERFORMANCE as this catholic priest.<br /><br />It is now number one on my movie list.<br /><br />Marlene
B005C9YZIM|5.0|I ordered this for my boyfriends birthday. I am a last minute shopper at times and I was in a  bind to get the gift on time. I ordered this DVD and got it the next day!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Great story, don't know why it took me 10 years to pick it up.  I finished it in 3 days and enjoyed the main idea of how we are all destined to accomplish something and that the universe will help us if we find the courage to pursue it (not to be mixed with the hype of \\"the Secret\\", the thought structure is much deeper than just, want it and you will get it :P)
B0013ND30M|3.0|Arrived fast bvt case was broken and the discs were a little scratched bvt other than that I'm pleased with the order
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I have used this case continually for about 8 months with almost no problems at all. It's thin and light, but very durable offering a good amount of protection for your kindle with a minimal amount of additional bulk. the elastic is still as strong as the day I got it and the stand makes it very convenient when watching TV while doing the dishes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Kindle app works seamlessly with online version, I am very pleased. I would not change anything in the app. Responsive and intuitive. recommended download! Thanks -VCL
B00338QENI|5.0|Our book club enjoyed the book, it was a source of very good conversation on many topics.  We watched an online interview by the author prior to discussing the book.  We enjoyed hearing her describe the method she used to structure the story; using the format from a current movie and a book of fiction as a guide on how she braided the story together.
030758836X|5.0|I just finished reading Dark Places and Gone Girls back-to-back.  It is readily apparent to me that Gillian Flynn is a crafty, dark, twisted monster in an absolutely wonderful and insightful way as well as a deftly writer.  She is a master story teller and has an uncanny abiility to guide readers through multiple layers of emotions and depth, weaving her story artfully and thoughtfully.  Readers have no need to suspend reality/beliefs to buy into her characters and their stories.  Simply put, her characters are real.<br /><br />With specific regards to Gone Girl, I found myself not only enthralled by the story and the characters, but also evaluating my life and my characteristics through the lens she provides.  Who hasn't been on the emotional roller coaster she conjures (at least to some degree).  Any of us could potentially be Nick or Amy Dunne, and that has a tinge of excitement and dread mixed up in it.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a MUST READ book.  It is dark, twisted, intriguing, deliciously fascinating, gripping, funny, surprising, unpredictable, intoxicating, brilliant; it is a realistic story about life.  Now I'm anxious to read Sharp Objects and then will have to suffer while waiting for the next book from Gillian's pen.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I first heard \\"Little Lion Man\\" a couple  years ago and was hooked. The entire album is worthwhile. I have no problem listening to it from beginning to end. It's great to hear folk-style in mainstream music. This was also my first purchase with Amazon Cloud Player and couldn't have been more pleased.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this is a great game and its really addicting. I wish I could change the tiles and I also would like if I didn't have to rush just to get one star but overall great game
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I thought this version of the movie was loads better than the original. The original was alittle too campy and borderline stupid. Yet this new addition to it kept alittle bit of the original campy tone to the movie yet wasn't so over the top that it was stupid. And for one moment we got away from the good vampire and saw what a vampire is meant to be. It was fun and a overall good horror movie. I don't get why people think that the original was so great. It was sort of stupid. I love campy horror movies as much as the next person but I don't like stupid. I really enjoyed this and it was really fun considering that movies today are overly dramatic and take themselves way to serious. I'll definitely be adding this one to my collection.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was disappointed with the conclusion, but it was very real.  So wish Martin would pick up the remaining threads and write some more on the series as he is an excellent story teller. However, it does stand as it is, and he is probably sick of it.
B009FREK3W|3.0|Mr. Blue Sky - The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra should have been titled The Best of E.L.O. as performed by Jeff Lynne since he's just about the only musician on this album (with the exception of strings, he does it all). No Bev Bevan. No Richard Tandy. No Mick Kaminski. This is NOT E.L.O. It's, for all intents and purposes, a Jeff Lynne solo album. They do sound nearly identical to the original songs but if you want the genuine article, buy All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra which are the 2006 re-mastered original recordings with 20 tracks instead of just 12.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|A must see! Chris Hemsworth is totally HOT, once again. Theron does a great job acting as the psycho queen. I really liked it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|good game good graphics works great on my fire :) great value for the price lots of puzzles and hidden object play
B00979OL5A|2.0|I can't say how excited I was to see this old game get some new life on a new platform...  and how disappointed I was with the end result.  Playing this game on the original Kindle fire was a unique experience and it looked great, and those are about the only positive things I have to say about it.<br /><br />The movement was jerky and often unpredictable, and I died often because of interface glitches. It took me a fair number of tries to figure out the characters movements and I never got to play enough to really get that smooth free wheeling feeling that the Prince of Persia games have become famous for because I was unwilling to pay for additional content.<br /><br />The pay to play/win format has never won me over.  I miss the days when games were a complete package and you could just decide if you wanted to pony-up up front for the whole lot.  I just don't get paying by the turn, buying infinite lives and potions or even the ability to save the game and start someplace other than a checkpoint.  For me it's just a distraction and it doesn't even seem fair.  When I play games I like to lose myself in the experience and I was never able to do that with this game.<br /><br />If you're in it just to kill some time, and you don't mind being bled dry for content, or that extra potion when you get stuck, the re-skin of the game is beautiful though, and my concerns about the controls might have subsided in time as I got used to the platform.  I just don't know.  If you see it for free the first few levels are worth a shot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SPOILERS POSSIBLE<br /><br />OK, the prelude to this is that I read all 3 books in a 3-day weekend after my nieces talked them up to me at Thanksgiving.  I think plenty of people have reviewed the first 2 books of the trilogy amply and well.  That said, this review is to mostly counter the numerous comments I have read about this installment being too depressing, no HEA, having a rushed ending, etc.<br /><br />How anyone could expect that teenagers, even if they grew up in horrid conditions and knowing they might have to participate in the games, are going to have some type of Disney-esque HEA is beyond me.  These kids went through the games TWICE, which is bad enough.  They then ended up in a WAR where they were used AGAIN.  Poor Peeta and the brainwashing he endured, Katniss being used & abused at every turn- plus what happens to her sister- this isn't the type of life people live without fallout.<br /><br />PTSD is very real.  People survive as best they can.  I honestly think that Collins handled the closure of the series in the best possible way.  This was written as YA material in the 1st place.  Sorry if it wasn't prettied up for those who need everything with a bow wrapped 'round it.  Realitistic endings keep the reader in the world, and our kids today shouldn't have everything softened for them.
B005LAII3U|5.0|This take on the Philip K. Dick short story \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\" is a much more faithful adaptation of the tale than the Arnold version. It's clear the director was also a fan of Blade Runner, another film based off of Dick's work, because it has the same gloomy atmosphere about it. This depiction of the future is dark and the film heads into noir territory, a complete turn from the lighthearted action film Arnold made in the 90's.<br /><br />Colin Farrell has been having dreams of visiting Mars, and he feels an urge to experience these dreams. But he's not a rich guy, just a regular worker, so a vacation to Mars is too expensive for him. Enter Total Recall, a company that specializes in implanting false meories inside a client's head to make him/her have memories of a trip they did in actuality not make.<br /><br />Farrell goes to the business, gets strapped in a chair and decides he wants to go to Mars as a double agent. After he's injected, things go very wrong.<br /><br />This is a great take on Dick's short story and is filled with a gritty, seedy atmosphere. It has nice action, the acting is good, and the film is way underrated, no doubt due to fans of Arnold's Total Recall.<br /><br />A huge letdown for the original Total Recall fans is the fact that Douglas Quaid (Farrell) doesn't go to Mars in the 2012 remake.<br /><br />Don't expect a remake of the Arnold Schwarzenegger version, and you should really enjoy this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I devoured the entire omnibus in about 2 days (with breaks for SEC football of course!).  I then immediately bought & downloaded the next in line, First Shift, [[ASIN:B007UAUPZS First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) (Wool)]].<br /><br />Well written PA fiction can be hard to find for a number of reasons, the least of which is some authors make humans out to be inherently bad- others are hopelessly naive about what makes people tick, and why.  Howey manages to straddle both perspectives and see things either way.  And wow, was he able to set up a shocker! How people in the silo saw things and how they incorporated their thoughts around how much information they had, and the results for each person.  As I hate it when spoilers abound in reviews, I won't let any drop here.  If you like thought-provoking reading material, try it out.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie went beyond what I expected. It was filled with action, romance and suspense. A terrific movie that I would highly recommend!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Loved all three films. They had a perfect story, perfect acting, the Joker was by far the best thing of this trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises was better then most people give it credit for. I just wished they would have mentioned the joker like they did in TDKR novel form. Already preordered.
B00457WZEI|4.0|This book was definitely a fast read.  There aren't a lot of names to remember and the story line is relatively simple.  I like how the book is written from the horse's point of view.  If you cry easily you will want to keep a tissue box close by.  The end was good but a little vague.
B004G6TD3O|4.0|... this is a pretty fine album by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. I especially like the fact that I get the distinct feeling I'm listening to a TRULY live album rather than, say, \\"Eagles Live,\\" the 1980 disc rumored to have been subjected to so many studio overdubs during postproduction that it isn't really \\"live\\" at all.<br /><br />You can hear, for example, a few slurry notes -- and even a couple of outright mistakes -- from keyboardist Keith Emerson on the opening track \\"Hoedown.\\" You can hear, on \\"Take A Pebble,\\" vocalist/bassist sliding up to a note on one phrase where it sounds like he was on the verge of going flat. And Carl Palmer -- surely one of the greatest drummers of his generation -- actually rushes the beat a little on one section of \\"Toccata.\\"<br /><br />These are the things, actually, that help make live performances memorable. It isn't that these guys, virtuosos one and all, are screwing up badly; it's just that they're dealing with the stage environment, where nerves, fatigue, distraction and other elements sometimes come into play.<br /><br />Overall, the performances are just brilliant. I've always been impressed by Emerson's ability to handle multiple keyboard parts; here, he routinely holds down an organ part while playing a Moog synthesizer solo, or vice versa -- and sometimes does this while covering the bass line with his feet, if Lake happened to be playing guitar instead of bass at that moment. As for Lake, he's somewhat underrated as a bassist. People like Chris Squire of Yes and the late John Entwistle of the Who got more attention over the years, but Lake is a fine player in his own right; the Who, in fact, called upon Lake to provide the bass part for a song called \\"Old Red Wine\\" after Entwistle's death. And Lake's tone is excellent, mixing in low rumbling and mid-range growl. Palmer is just a joy to listen to, as he blends jazz phrasing and classical flourishes with a heavier rock touch.<br /><br />Standouts on this disc: A complete performance of \\"Tarkus,\\" the sidelong composition from the band's second album; an excellent arrangement of Lake's \\"Take A Pebble\\" that incorporates \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"Still ... You Turn Me On\\"; and, best of all, a complete (even a little extended) performance of \\"Karn Evil 9,\\" the band's masterful epic that appeared on \\"Brain Salad Surgery.\\"<br /><br />Live albums succeed or fail based not only on the musical performances but also on the mood the band establishes or fails to establish. On this disc, ELP clearly are having a good time, and so is the audience. I recommend it.ance of \\"Tarkus,\\" the sidelong composition from the band's second album; an excellent arrangement of Lake's \\"Take A Pebble\\" that incorporates \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"Still ...

B006H5120E|4.0|Of course, the movie is great. But, seeing it in 3D takes it to an even higher level. If you have a 3D TV this is a must see!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great alternative to Angry Birds. I'd go so far as to say it easily exceeds Angry Birds. I loved it a lot.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book wasn't as good as i had hoped.  I really wanted to like it since I was told that it was better than 50 Shades (which I loved even though the writing wasn't the best).  The main characters had a COMPLETELY unbelievable amount of sex!  I mean, he couldn't be that hard all the time even on Viagra!  Plus, the main character is so much stronger than most, yet she lets him get away with so much crap!  Also, how is this guy, who is so self contained and has all this inner strength, completely accepting of how much he needs her?  Not really believable to me... But maybe thats just my experience.
B007QVLKI2|4.0|I bought the MP3 \\"album\\" on the strength of the Little Talks video, which was included. I like the other songs, too. though they do tend to sound all alike, the lyrics are sometimes moving, sometimes amusing, and always evokative of some needed mood.

B0053O8ARI|5.0|I love this show, I can't stop laughing. If you haven't seen it, please do. Because missing out on something as funny as this, should be criminal. Sure the show is a tad dirty, and it pushes it sometimes. But that is what makes it the best show ever

B006O2QNOU|5.0|Cascading talents of Zachary Quinto, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Spacey, Simon Baker, and Jeremy Irons sieve the emotions out of an about-to-fall-apart Wall Street firm the night before the market opens. They don't talk about technical details, only the emotions acted out in the actors' faces and dialogue as one might imagine on real executives' faces when the \\"big one\\" comes.<br /><br />Most recent jaw-dropping Wall Street debacle I kept thinking of, as I was watching this movie, was what happened to Knight Capital Group (KCG). This financial firm lost about $400 Million in about 20 minutes due to a software glitch that spent several billion dollars meant to be spread over several months in less than half an hour. Its share value collapsed. It still hasn't recovered as of writing this review.<br /><br />What might have gone through the faces of people in KCG? This movie gives a glimpse of what might have happened: Nothing to those at the highest level, played by Irons, who asks a younger analyst to tell him what is going on as if he was \\"a child or a dog\\". Irons plays a character of hard cold emotions oblivious to what happens to many, but in need of the loyalty and even affection of the few--suggesting a marginal glow of emotion.<br /><br />Just below him is a colder and utterly emotionless positional leader played by Baker, who is best known as the Mentalist. His character is meant to eclipse whatever emotion the higher up might have. And below him the leader of the smart worker bees. This role, the most demanding, is played by Spacey masterfully: displaying the dichotomy of being emotional and not. The push and pull of wanting something and not. The resistance creates an internal hurricane not many actors can pull off, and make it look like he's not acting.<br /><br />At the lowest level are those whose emotions are not yet in check, controlled, or eliminated altogether. What-if scenarios swirl in their minds into desperation and tears. But not for the character played by Quinto, who became famous in the TV show Heroes and the better made Star Trek movie. To say that he gets a promotion later would not give up anything about this story. The character is a prime candidate capable of ridding of all emotions like a Vulcan.<br /><br />The story makes a point of a distorted reality: money as an end. Yet we have learned from the best known distortionist of reality, Steve Jobs, that money should never be an end, but a means to create great products that people will want to buy. He proved that human resources of Apple can trump over the natural resources of Exxon. That last comment was in defense of capitalism. Either way, while emotions must be controlled, they are, ultimately, called for to be human.by Quinto, who became famous in the TV show Heroes and the better made Star Trek movie.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|A novel that keeps you not wanting to lay the Kendle down until you have finished the story.<br />Reacher, novels always keeps your attention and always,keeps you in suspense. The western states is a very good plot area for this kind of story.
1609611543|3.0|This is a very comprehensive and technical book that provides a great deal of information about wheat and how it affects  our bodies. If you are someone who wants a quick fix to your weight issues;this is not the book for you. Dr. Davis proscribes a very regimented and life changing approach to losing the weight and obtaining better health. I have found the research on how wheat is not the same wheat that people ate thousands of years ago very interesting.<br />The book is worth reading. I am not sure that I would be able to change my diet completely as he suggests.

B009IKPOUO|5.0|Yes, I constantly wonder, how Barbra is going to wow me, yet again?  And she has!  I was about 12 years old when my father brought home her first album and I have been a fan ever since.  It is hard to imagine that these beautiful songs have been locked away for almost three decades.  The major bonus to Streisand aficionados is that every song sounds like it was recorded in state-of-the-art digital.  No doubt digitally remastered, every song sounds like it comes from the same recording session, crisp and clear with Streisand's voice at the very peak of her five decade long career.  Amazing that with hundreds of albums to choose from, 90% of the time I am listening to Barbara while working at the computer.  As I type this, 'With One More Look At You' is playing, a version I have never heard, from the hit Streisand movie 'A Star Is Born' from 1976.  So that puts this collection at well over thirty years, but you will never know it.  Best of all, the songs compliment each other in ways that can only be appreciated by the listener.  Play the samples from the Amazon page, buy the album and fall in love with the enchanting Barbra Streisand all over again.  This album begs the question, what else is locked away for future release?  I'll bet that Jay Landers of Sony Music could tell us off the top of his head.<br /><br />Update 10/15/2012 - Now I've had a week to totally absorb and fall totally in love with all the songs, I question if I did the album the justice it is due in my first review.  First, this compilation is totally unique for Barbra in a very good way. There are some titles which I have become my new favorites.  \\"Willow Weep For Me' is simply outstanding in its unique phrasing, including the outstanding way it displays the dynamic range of Ms. Streisand's voice.  \\"Didn't We\\" is bound to appeal to the lost loves in your life.  \\"With One More Look At You\\" speaks to me in ways that have affected me throughout my life.  When I saw Barbra perform the song in \\"A StarIs Born\\" I had just lost a childhood friend who died tragically in auto accident.  I totally lost it in the theater.  This song will be forever linked to that event.  So my message is that these songs are so profound and that Barbra sings them in a way that penetrates each of our soul's differently.  Most listeners around bound to reminisce and relate to these incredible masterpieces that will be unique to their life experience.  I wish you the same awakening of memories throughout your life.  Some will hurt, most will bring joy, but you will feel more alive for having experienced this incredible album.

B0024Y7H10|5.0|I started watching this the same time walking dead season two came out. This show puts walking dead to shame. I never had a problem falling asleep watching this show and enjoyed it for the most part.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I loved this book.  I rarely read fiction unless it has some literary, historical basis.  This book was based on the actual events of Afghanistan in the 70's, 80's, 90's and 00's.  It was beautifully illustrated through the experiences of two women, 15 years difference in age.  I loved it and can not recommend it highly enough.  Please do not hesitate to read this book.
0307341550|2.0|This dark novel is filled with very disturbed, sadistic female characters.  We get in depth descriptions of vicious acts, including poisonings, the gouging out of an eye, and the biting off and probable eating of an ear lobe.  The narrator engages in self-mutilation.  Despite the gore, the narration is slowed down by excessive repetition.  I'm glad I read Gone Girl, which I thoroughly enjoyed, before this book.  If I'd read Sharp Objects first I would never have read another book by Flynn.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|Okay, some people like the Depp/Burton formula, and some don't.  Personally, I liked this movie for what it was.  But that is not the intention of my review.  I am concerned about the quality of the bluray.  Does anyone else's bluray jerk in places?  I'm not talking about panning shots, but I mean in just normal scenes, the film will jump a little. My bluray is up-to-date on its firmware and other discs do not have a problem.  I'm wondering if its just the disc itself, or if there is something I can do to make it play better??
B000JLPMPS|3.0|What has not been said here that I can say? Not a whole hell of a lot. From the art direction to the acting to the script to damn near everything.... This is basically a perfect film besides maybe a couple things other westerns do better. I think I am going to leave it at that. The Bluray by Warner could definitely have a higher bitrate and more filmic quality. It also has lossy audio which is never good. I friggin' love this western. Eastwood's best film hands down. I bet they will release an anniversary so it is advisable to wait for another edition.<br /><br />15Mbps transfer and 640kbps audio. Not cool. I will wait for the 4K release. I do have this in Eastwood's boxset but I won't be coming back to it anytime soon. The film deserves better.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Downton Abbey, Season 2 is just as entertaining as Season 1. One gets lost in all the extravagance; the set decoration, the costumes, the house and the wonderful acting. So much attention to detail is appreciated by this viewer and I long for more from this amazing ensemble cast. Maggie Smith should get an Oscar for this one....just love her.
B00IDZLLA2|5.0|When Eastwood knew subtlety he could do no wrong. The 90s were by far Eastwood's best decade and boy were they damn good. This is one of the better romances I have seen come out of Hollywood. A smashing ending that will have you in tears more than likely or just wistful and sad in any case. I think they played this one absolutely perfectly. The locations are beautiful, the acting is real, and the script is one of the best I have seen Eastwood direct. It is a bit slow but it's very rewarding for those who like the cinema. Five stars for an unforgettable film.<br /><br />The bluray is beautiful and seems very faithful to the film. A huge upgrade from the DVD. Highly recommended.

B015S4DS1K|3.0|This film is overly cliche and a little ridiculous in context. I am sorry but I would have given this 4 stars if this hadn't one of the most predictable endings in movie history. All I can think is Clint was on meds or people around him were saying it was great. I almost shut it off before the credits.<br /><br />Why would you end a film with such a horrible climax that goes against pretty much what you were trying, or so I thought, to build up the entire film. Sure there was going to be a confrontation. But a whole house of people? Come on man. This is just beyond reality. I was immediately taken out of the film by the end but some of the wooden as hell acting and script surely did not help up to that point. If this is five stars than near anything with a good message is five stars.<br /><br />The gangs are portrayed as a bit too mindless and Clint himself is too gruff and disembodied to suddenly change ways and start loving and caring for these people. THERE IS NO SUBTLY in this film but with a couple of the better scenes.<br /><br />I will say the dinner between Clint and the neighbors was a great scene and made the enormous gap in their relationship seem worth the jump. I like scenes like these in films. But this film has far too few of them. I can't give this any more than 2 stars because quite simply it's not that great even besides the ending. I really thought I was in for a masterpiece here and came away quite disappointed. Clint's output has been quite up and down lately in my mind. Films like Mystic River are much better imo, albeit they have the same tendency to annoy with the ending, and ones like these are mediocre because they do not build properly for one and another because of the quality of the acting and script.<br /><br />Mystic River had a lot of things going for it that this one simply does not. I for one saw the ending in that film to be much more subtle. I wasn't sure of Bacon's plans for Penn's character and to me it was more ambiguous than not. This one is just outright crude. This man has made films as great as The Bridges of Madison County, A Perfect World, and Unforgiven and he has also made entirely overrated stuff like Million Dollar Baby and tripe like Space Cowboys. You never know what you are in for but it seems in his old age he likes those shocking endings. This one is not as bad as Baby but I can't say I enjoyed it that much. That's how she goes.ot.

B00192IV9U|5.0|While there have been many, many, many people and comments about this album.  From some of the songs not being Michael at all-all the way to Michael would not have approved this.<br /><br />Here is my lonely thoughts on this CD...<br /><br />As a MJ fan since the age of 2(I was born in November of 1980) I have to say that my true oppinion is this is without a doubt in my mind 100000% MICHAEL'S REAL VOICE on every single track. I can definately see where some may think otherwise, but remember these are demo's and unfinished by MJ songs, so the quality may not be there for a true Michael enthisist.<br /><br />Now as to if MJ would ever want this released like this?  I say no, but I also must point out that he himself when still alive released numerous demo's and unfinished works for his fans.  In particular on the Special Edition's of Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad.  So I am sure he would not be spinning in his grave over this release.<br /><br />All the producers and musicians worked on this album in order to give these rare gems an clean sound, and make them as close to Michael's vision as one could, and I for one love that they put their heart and soul into this, for MJ and MJ's fans.<br /><br />Each song is great, and I can and have listened to the album over and over.  Granted I personally like some songs over others, but I never skip one, so for those still in doubt of buying this album, I say buy it give it a chance, and you will not be dissapointed.<br /><br />Michael is the best and this album helps to show us that there is still much more to look foreward to in the future with previously unreleased MJ tracks.
0618871713|5.0|While \\"Are You My Mother?\\" is about the author's distant, aloof mother who nevertheless shared bookish interests with her daughter, this book is about her father, who lived in the closet his entire life.<br /><br />Alison Bechdel, who draws the famous comic strip about lesbian characters, grew up as a child in a beautiful Victorian mansion that her father himself had lovingly renvoted and filled with prized antique furnishing, which his unfortunate children found very stifling. Being an obsessive perfectionist, the father had forced his family into an idealized 1950s image to cover up who he really was: an abusive, narrasstic thug who preyed on young boys. Yet the author continued to ache for his fatherly love and approval, especially when she found herself in the same closet, too.<br /><br />If that isn't all, the author spent her unhappy childhood in a world where parents exposed young children to naked, half-dissected bodies in the family-operated morgue, violently mistreated the mother within a child's earshot at bedtime, and went ballistic when a kid very nearly broke one of his favorite objects (it should be HIM who gets to break it, of course), where kids were taken to rather sleazy gay hangouts and friend's house where pornographic paintings of the mother figure hung in plain view, and where the father's groomed young male victims served as nursemaids and helping hands with his dream projects.<br /><br />And the final tragedy strikes when the father's life is cut short by an oncoming bakery truck, which the author suspects is a deliberate suicide.<br /><br />The worst irony of all is that if the father was actually \\"allowed\\" to be who he truly was in a rigidly conversative 1950s-1960s society, there would be no Alison Bechdel to discover who she really is, of course.<br /><br />Skilly drawn with delicate blue watercolor shading and peppered by visual symbols, notes indicating something specific with a cartoonish Dick Tracyesque arrow, and references to classic books, the author spins a very bittersweet (and sometimes, TMI) autobiography where she both comes of age and comes out, too.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love Jack Reacher.  How can you not love a man who has no cell phone,no car, buys throw away clothes every few days, saves the world from disaster in every book.  A tall man who can take it and give even more of it to the bad guys.  Lee Child is a wonderful author.  The problem with creating a superman is I expect even greater efforts with each book.  Kind of like movies with special effects...once I see how spectacular they can be...I want more.<br /><br />I am delighted to hear that Jack Reacher is going become a movie hero but Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher is beyond my ability to understand.  To create Reacher's height comparison, the rest of the cast must be five feet tall or under.<br /><br />I will keep buying all of the books that Lee Child writes...his heroic character is pure red, white, and blue.<br /><br />Dr. Tommy Neuman

B0025UHKNS|3.0|I'm not impressed with the gps of this Garmin at all. I'd like to think with a name like Garmin it'd be slightly more accurate. If I run say 3.5 miles out and back instead of coming up with 7 often times it'll say I only ran 3 miles back.. How'd I cut a half mile off my run when I literally turned around and ran the exact same way back? It's frustrating!<br /><br />Another frustration is the lack of battery power.. I used this charged at 100% for one 7 mile run, went to use it for a simple 3 miles the next day, completely dead.. It needs to live on the charger! I'm starting to see some polar watches that are definitely in competition and I'll be upgrading again. I got this watch when it first came out because I was using the old bulky forerunner but honestly, I think the old one was far superior to this watch.
B009B50QOU|4.0|The easiest way to describe this album for a prospective buyers is \\"fun\\". It lacks almost all the political motivation and storyline of the previous two albums, along with a more straight forward musical style.<br /><br />On my first listen, I will say that this album ranked around 3 stars for me. I already felt that the \\"Oh Love\\" single was mediocre. The album musical style feels fragmented from song to song. Many of the tracks sound like they were crafted for other albums but didn't fit in with the themes and tucked away, similar to the Shenanigans b-sides album. Each song should be enjoyed individually, ignoring the musical style and time period of the previous song. And just like Shenanigans, despite there being inconsistencies from song to song, there is a lot of great material here that needed to be released.<br /><br />Any Green Day fans dating back to the 90s will probably find a favorite track in \\"Let Yourself Go\\". As a fan of the Clash, \\"Kill The DJ\\" has been a personal favorite of mine as it seems to be Green Day's \\"Magnificent Seven\\" or \\"This Is Radio Clash\\".<br /><br />And speaking of the Clash, I will echo what other reviewers said about elements of garage rock being present on the album. Many of the tracks have guitar solos reminiscent of songs off \\"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\". History is what ties all these songs together, the album is a bit like you dropped all Green Day albums up to Warning into a blender. I encourage listeners to listen to each track and try to place which album the song may have felt at home on.<br /><br />A few minor complaints about the album. Despite the album's 12 tracks and 42 minute length, it feels shorter than other Green Day albums (even \\"Warning\\" which was almost identical). I believe this is due to how often portions of songs are repeated. \\"Oh Love\\" is the biggest offender, clocking in at 5 minutes when it seems like a better song could have been crafted from the material in 3-4 minutes.<br /><br />Green Day alsosteals from their previous albums again, the most obvious example being \\"Scattered\\" from Nimrod in \\"Rusty James\\".<br /><br />There are a few suspect lyric choices made on the album, I am forgiving because large projects like this sometimes stretch creativity a bit thin across albums (such as the Magnetic Fields - \\"69 Love Songs\\").<br /><br />I felt like this was a pretty solid release for Green day, and 4 stars is a fair rating for the work presented on this album. I doubt that this album will do well on the radio, but I can see it maintaining a fairly high level of praise moving into the future, not too dissimilar to \\"Warning\\" 12 years ago.
B007L96VCY|5.0|As Paul McCartney once half-jokingly commented, his new career after his years with The Beatles sort of meant that he would have to prove himself again.  So, in his words, The Beatles were «a tough act to follow...».  Well, RAM showed us all that Sir Paul was up to the challenge.  Nice vocals such as those on «Dear Boy», a bit of pleasant country-style on «Heart Of The Country», which is a bit reminiscent of «Mother Nature's Son» on The Beatles (the unamed white double album), and the snappy «Too Many People» of course (that John Lennon didn't enjoy, feeling Paul was somewhat critizing him and Yoko with the line «Too many people preaching practices...»).  Also, it is to be noted that his wife Linda co-wrote many of the songs with Paul, as well as take the cover photo and others, while Paul created the original art work of the album.[[ASIN:B007L96VCY RAM [Special Edition]]

B001HBYHFA|4.0|I watched this movie several years ago having never seen its progenitor, the Firefly series. At the time I probably would have rated it a 3. The movie was decent enough, but I could tell I was missing a lot of backstory and therefore I found it hard to become involved. It was clear that I was supposed to care deeply about characters that the movie alone hadn't really made me care about. To be honest, it didn't hold my attention much.<br /><br />A couple months back I found that the series was on Amazon Prime. I watched it and then rewatched the movie, and whaddaya know, with the character backstories in place the movie was gripping and emotionally charged. I'm not the first reviewer to say this, but if you're going to watch Serenity you are really doing yourself a disservice by not watching the Firefly series first.<br /><br />I rate the movie lower than five because I really don't think it stands on its own very well, but greater than three because it is an excellent capstone to the saga.
B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|This is a really great movie. My three almost four year old grandson loved it in the theater when he and his mom saw it, so I bought it.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|Being a fan of the original Dark Shadows television show is wonderful<br />and it was a unique, special time and place.<br /><br />This new movie is certainly not perfect but the folks who made it --<br />Tim Burton, Johnny Depp,Michelle Pfeiffer -- are also fans of the<br />original series. Even though this film shifts tone from humor to<br />horror to heart, it is still done with affection.<br /><br />The original DS actors who<br />apppeared in brief cameos have stated that they respect the<br />new vision and it certainly does not diminish the unique aspects<br />of the original.<br /><br />The film has brought renewed attention to the<br />original show and helped expand it to new audiences. It might<br />have been nice if the Depp-Burton film were more traditional<br />in its approach but they chose a different direction and instead<br />of just doing a straight remake, which already happened with<br />the 1991 primetime TV remake, it is a loving mash-up.

B00005JSGK|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  He is doing everything in this movie.  You would expect him to be on a horse out West, well he is in Africa, not on safari but gathering up animals, with a lot of good actors and bringing you to the chair to sit and watch all the fun and danger in gathering them up for the zoos.  The little elephants and the one young girl in the movie makes it, as she is smart and also got her eye on John right off of the bat.  The elephants love her and she ends up with three elephants, and fun in trying to keep them fed, going out with the crew to capture others and not learning until the first trip that she should ride inside.  She even is good at dancing and playing the piano, but best of all, is teaching John how to kiss.  A darned good movie and I would never be without it in my DVD collection.  Thanks Amazon.com for having it on hand.  I purchased it and began watching it and have lent it out to others and they feel the same way.  Loving John Wayne in a whole new character.<br />He seems younger in this one, had to be to help corale these animals, especially the little monkeys that Red Buttons has a gimmick to capture and earn them alot of money.

B004G5ZY7E|3.0|I must have enjoyed this book as I stayed up late reading and finished in two nights. There were definitely some interesting diversions woven in to the plot but I was able to figure out who did it before I was half way through - Thought maybe it would be someone else but alas, I was right. Still - enjoyable read and couldn't beat the price as it was a public library book borrowed via kindle and Amazon!<br /><br />Also worth watching The Headhunters (which, as a prime member, I was able to watch at no additional cost).
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I think it's safe to say that even though they've truly upset and angered some fans (to the point of leaving the KISS army) Paul and Gene still command a vast KISS army around the world. With Sonic Boom, KISS was back and it was a nice return after 11 years of complete studio silence and lack of a new album. SB was mostly well received as a return to form and a great KISS album. Then there are fans who didn't buy the album because it's not KISS and it's disrespectful to Ace and Peter who were the originals to have Tommy and Eric wear their makeup. I understand both sides completely and agree with both, but I liked Sonic Boom for what it was and three years later it's follow up (and 20th studio!) album, Monster is I have to say, better. While I was glad that there was a new KISS album and I enjoyed it, SB sounded a little too 80's rooted at times. However, Monster is heavier, doesn't feel like 80's KISS and its edgy and aggressive and did I say heavy? The guitars are turned up LOUD and the drum is almighty, the sound that comes from it is massive, anthemic and fist pumping Hard Rock formula pushing far into Metal territory and as a fan, that's good. It helps that there are no ballads either. At this point it shouldn't be about \\"Fake KISS\\" and so on like there was a lot of talk on the Sonic Boom Amazon page, the music should stand on its own. Buying the new KISS album was always like an event, an obligation in some way whether it was Love Gun or Dynasty or Crazy Nights and now, Monster.<br /><br />Opening track and first single \\"Hell or Halleluiah\\" is in your face heavy,  and I was surprised at how fast it sounded. To me it sounds like something from Love Gun in '77 like \\"I Stole Your Love\\" meets the speed of \\"Gimme More\\" from Lick It Up or perhaps another fast 80's KISS tune. It works really well, it's anthemic, it's pure KISS and Paul sings it like he's on fire and the backing vocals just get it done. \\"Wall of Sound\\" is Gene being the real demon Gene Simmons again. He's menacing and attitude comes throughout, it's one of the best songs on Monster.  \\"Freak\\" is a track that I love if not just for the lyrics, they're representative of KISS in a way and Paul does nicely here, it's catchy and hits it home. \\"Back To The Stone Age\\", now this is what I'm talking about! The sound is massive, heavy and Gene's voice, he's got that angry demon voice we all love. The lyrics are cool and very Gene, there's even a neat little breakdown and it's one of the best songs here absolutely. \\"Shout Mercy\\" is undeniably catchy and has that classic, quintessential chorus that made their classic songs memorable and radio staples, and the \\"whoohoos\\" back vocals add to the catchiness, you'll see.\\"All For The Love Of Rock And Roll\\" is one that I quite like, it's slower paced and less aggressive and Eric Singer does a wonderful job on the vocals (\\"All For The Glory\\" was one of my favorite songs on SB). On an album where pretty much the songs are heavy it's nice to have something to balance it out, and while not a ballad this song does just that. I could almost see it as a single on radio. \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" starts out with just the band singing and nothing else, those harmonies sound great and you know it's going to be a cool track. It kicks in and doesn't let you down, another strong one. \\"Outta This World\\" is sung by Tommy Thayer and it fits the Spaceman persona nicely, I much prefer this one to the song he had on Sonic Boom, it's a good rockin' track I was impressed by Tommy. \\"Take Me Down Below\\" has obviously sexual innuendo and the reason this one is special is because Gene and Paul share lead. Gene has his story that's reminiscent of \\"She's So European\\" from the 1980 Unmasked album (talks about a lady, standing there, champing, perfume, now she's standing next to me, very Simmons) and Paul comes up with something and then the chorus and it works nicely I wish they did this more often. The only song that didn't really do it for me was \\"Last Chance\\" but while it's not awful I think the album might have ended stronger without it. I haven't gone through every song or every little detail but I think you get the idea of my appreciation.<br /><br />I was initially worried about the album being delayed as usually that's never a good sign, but the album is excellent and those fears were unfounded it turns out. They've been at it for 40 years now (almost) and it doesn't show, they have that drive and that passion in the sound. I think it shows more of their influences too, in one song I detected a really Zeppelin-ish part and so on which I think was great. Gene really surprised me on Monster with his lyrics, voice and attitude he really contributed amazing stuff time around that exceeds what he did on the previous album, I think his songs may just be the best ones here.  It's not a retro album, its KISS being KISS and kicking it up a notch and sounding tighter and heavier and it works extremely well. Sonic Boom grew on me, Monster I loved immediately (SB had that extra re-recorded KISS Klassics CD and live DVD but Monster stands proudly on its 12 songs people).<br /><br />To me Sonic Boom wasn't a five stars KISS album, while very good it didn't take it to the next level which is exactly what Monster does. Is it the perfect KISS record? Look at this point it's better than I could have anticipated, exceeds the last one which was really good and it stands on its own, plus they're heavier this time around and it's the record they needed to follow up SB with. To me it's full marks on this one, Monster really is a Monster and it impressed me! Nicely done and I don't say just because I'm a die-hard fan with everything they've made. Initally the band talked about having another painting as the album cover much like Destroyer or Love Gun and that didn't happen, a slight let down. Now I'd just love to see KISS play a big chunk of this album in a LIVE setting, they sound made for the stage and I can only imagine how well it would work. 5/5.ut while it's not awful I think the album might have ended stronger without it. I haven't gone through every song or every little detail but I think you get the idea of my appreciation.<br /><br />I was initially worried about the album being delayed as usually that's never a good sign, but the album is excellent and those fears were unfounded it turns out.

It's not a retro album, its KISS being KISS and kicking it up a notch and sounding tighter and heavier and it works extremely well. Sonic Boom grew on me, Monster I loved immediately (SB had that extra re-recorded KISS Klassics CD and live DVD but Monster stands proudly on its 12 songs people).<br /><br />To me Sonic Boom wasn't a five stars KISS album, while very good it didn't take it to the next level which is exactly what Monster does. Is it the perfect KISS record? Look at this point it's better than I could have anticipated, exceeds the last one which was really good and it stands on its own, plus they're heavier this time around and it's the record they needed to follow up SB with. To me it's full marks on this one, Monster really is a Monster and it impressed me! Nicely done and I don't say just because I'm a die-hard fan with everything they've made. Initally the band talked about having another painting as the album cover much like Destroyer or Love Gun and that didn't happen, a slight let down. Now I'd just love to see KISS play a big chunk of this album in a LIVE setting, they sound made for the stage and I can only imagine how well it wouldwork. 5/5.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I went and seen this movie in theaters, and like most were still left with unanswered questions. Like how does the alien get put back in the chair after dying in the escape pod to link Prometheus to Alien. Or how after the alien bursts from the chest cavity looking like the Alien we know and love, but is different in ways that makes zero sense. The way Prometheus ended basically sets it up for another type of alien saga movie, but then It completely contradicts the other Alien movies that already have been made. I do like the movie do not get me wrong, i love sci-fi movies which Is why im still buying it. It has great visual effects, and should not be taken lightly.

0525953728|4.0|According to the other reviews, some in the Special Forces community have expressed outrage and disappointment in the author for allegedly exposing secrets that could be used by enemies of the US against us.  I don't see it.  Al Qaeda isn't going to learn any more from No Easy Day then they would by watching [[ASIN:B001F12J0C The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)]], [[ASIN:B002G1WPHM The Unit: The Complete Series]], or reading Marcinko's Rouge Warrior series of books.  Author Mark Owen manages to walk the thin line of embedding the reader in the team while still remaining vague enough about tactics and strategies.  So fear not citizens, No Easy Day is not a handbook for defeating SEALS or other SF units.  The cynic in me thinks all that hoopla about the government not approving and delaying the book's release was just a clever marketing ploy to sell more copies.  Surely if the government thought classified material was going to be released that would jeopardize national security they would have brought the project to a screeching halt long before its release and Mr. Owen would be in jail as I pen this review.<br /><br />Owen's story begins with his chopper about to crash land in the Bin Laden compound before flashing back to his origins in Alaska.  He's captivated by a copy of [[ASIN:1250036224 Men in Green Faces: A Novel of U.S. Navy SEALs]] by Gene Wentz and decides that's what he wants to do when he grows up.  He graduates high school and his father convinces him to graduate college before embarking on his dream of becoming a SEAL.  He survives BUD/s and a few combat deployments before being assigned to Green Team, the selection process for the elite SEAL Team Six.  Once on Six, he describes being deployed with Delta to Iraq on missions to capture/eliminate insurgent leaders and former regime loyalists.  He also describes his involvement in the Easter Sunday 2009 rescue of Maersk Alabama Captain, Richard Phillips.<br /><br />Then it's on to the big show.  Owen gives a blow by blow description of the mission to take out Osama from the month of planning and practicing every contingency to the post-mission intel analysis.  All of the sweat and planning on the practice field would pay off.  Owen's chopper would crash land in the compound and his team would be forced to attack from the ground instead of from the roof as was originally planned.  Another issue was that no one knew for sure what the inside of the compound looked like.  They would have to rely on their training, dedication, and skill to keep the mission on track.<br /><br />Time was also a factor.  The teams were disappointed that they could not gather all of the available files and computers in the compound.  There was simply too much stuff and too little time to retrieve it all.  They had to exfiltrate or face an unwanted showdown with the Pakistani Military.<br /><br />I was surprised to read what a coward Osama Bin Laden was.  He did not defend himself when the SEALs breached his room.  In fact, he hid behind his wife like a big wussy.  He had to know they were there to get him and he had plenty of time to arm himself.  An AK-47 and a pistol were found in his room.  Owen states that this is typically the case.  The higher up you went in the terror organization, the less likely the leaders were willing to fight.  These punks send their underlings to blow themselves up and do their evil bidding for them.<br /><br />I have the utmost respect and gratitude to those who serve in my country's armed services.  They sacrifice themselves, putting family and personal lives on the back burner so we can live the<br />American dream.  No civilian can ever really understand what it's like to be an elite Special Forces operator.  No Easy Day provides a glimpse at the real story; not the media or Hollywood's grandiose dramatization of what happened.  This is modern history told by an operator that was in the room when Bin Laden got his.  Every patriotic American should read this book.ot his.  Every patriotic American should read this book.

0553807919|5.0|As a father of three sons and a daughter and one of the grandfathers of their ten children, I can certainly understand what Daniel Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson have in mind while discussing moments of extreme stress for parents when their children become infuriating and intolerable. That is why I was intrigued by their explanation of the power of the \\"whole-brain approach\\" during all manner of touchpoints in parent-child relationships. That power is especially helpful in \\"the moments you are just trying to survive\\" because it creates \\"opportunities to help your child to thrive.\\" In fact, the 12 strategies that Siegal and Bryson recommend can be effective for almost [begin italics] anyone [end italics] who has direct and frequent contact with children, including teachers, coaches, and clergy as well as parents and other relatives.<br /><br />In fact, with only minor modification, I think they can be beneficial to interactive relationships between and among adults, especially to those within a workplace.<br /><br />\\"What's great about this survive-and-thrive approach is that you don't have to try to carve out special time to help your children thrive. You can use [begin italics] all [end italics] of the interactions you share - the stressful, angry ones as well as the miraculous, adorable ones - as opportunities to help them become the responsible, caring, capable people you want them to be. That's what this book is about: using those everyday moments with your kids to help them reach their true potential.\\"<br /><br />These are among the passages that caught my eye:<br /><br />o Integration of Various Mental Domains (Pages 6-10)<br />o Get in the Flow: Navigating the Waters Between Chaos and Rigidity (10-13)<br />o Left Brain, Right Brain: An Introduction (15-16)<br />o Two Halves Make a Whole: Combining the Left and the Right (18-22)<br />o The Mental Staircase: Integrating the Upstairs and Downstairs Brain (38-41)<br />o Integrating Ourselves: Using Our Own Mental Staircase (64-65)<br />o Integrating Implicit and Explicit: Assembling the Puzzle Pieces of the Mind (76-86)<br />o Mindsight and the Wheel of Awareness (93-97)<br />o Integrating Ourselves: Looking at Our Own Wheel of Awareness (117-118)<br />o Laying the Groundwork for Connection: Creating Positive Mental Models (125-127)<br />o Cultivating a \\"Yes\\" State of Mind: Helping Kids Be Receptive to Relationships (129-133)<br />o Integrating Ourselves: Making Sense of Our Own Story (143-144)<br /><br />Note: I urge you to check out another of Siegal's books, Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation, in which Mindsight and the Wheel of Awareness are among the subjects discussed.<br /><br />Readers will appreciate Siegal and Bryson's skillful use of \\"What You Can Do\\" sections throughout their narrative that serve several purposes, notably focusing on key points while suggesting specific initiatives to apply what has been learned from the given material. For example, \\"What You Can Do: Helping Your Child Work from Both Sides of the Brain\\" (Pages 22-33). Dozens of eminently appropriate illustrations were created by Tuesday Mourning.<br /><br />However, no brief commentary such as mine could possibly do full justice to the scope and depth of what Siegal and Bryson cover, with eloquence as well as rigor. I have elected not to list the twelve (12) strategies because I think they are best revealed in context, within the narrative. I do presume to suggest that those who are about to read this book begin and then frequently review later the \\"Whole-Brain Ages and Stages\\" material (on Pages 154-168) because it creates a wide and deep context, a frame of reference, for the abundance of information, insights, and recommendations in the six preceding chapters and Conclusion, \\"Bringing It All Together. \\"<br /><br />This book need not be read straight through (although I prefer that approach) but it should certainly be consulted frequently, hence the importance of \\"Whole-BrainAges and Stages\\" and the Index as well as (I hope) passages of special importance that have been highlighted.<br /><br />I also presume to suggest that Daniel Siegal and Tina Payne Bryson's brilliant book will be most valuable to whole-brain readers. In it, they provide what they characterize in the Introduction as \\"an antidote to parenting and academic approaches that overemphasize achievement and perfection at any cost.\\" It is imperative that everyone involved directly (and even indirectly) with the development if children \\"understand some basics about the young brain that [they] are helping to grow and develop.\\"Ages and Stages\\" and the Index as well as (I hope) passages of special importance that have been highlighted.<br /><br />I also presume to suggest that Daniel Siegal and Tina Payne Bryson's brilliant book will be most valuable to whole-brain readers.

B009FREK3W|4.0|Jeff Lynne, the driving force behind ELO, has two albums out this month. The first is his Long Wave album, released under his own name, and this album, branded as an ELO album. The honest truth is that he re-did these songs, probably to garner some royalties from them when used in commercials and movies. Is Jeff Lynne ELO? Some disagree, and it's true that Bev Bevan's drumming was a part of their unique sound, as was Kelly Groucutt's guitar and vocal work, Richard Tandy's keyboards, and Louis Clark's string arrangements.<br /><br />Some fans consider this is misrepresentation on Lynne's part, others feel that Jeff WAS and IS ELO. I'll leave it to the reader to make their own decision.<br /><br />Many of these tracks are as good, or better than the originals. I was disappointed in Don't Bring Me Down, which sounds like it was done in a closet. It lacks the \\"size\\" of the original. Turn to Stone has a bit of that sound, too, but not as bad. The rest of the tracks are interesting as covers of the originals. It's cool to see how Jeff's sound has matured over the years. For many fans, the track \\"Point of No Return\\" is what will drive them to buy the album. That, and curiosity.<br /><br />If you're a casual fan, you'll probably be happier to buy another collection.  For the die-hard fan, it's worth a listen.

B004RUF9DC|3.0|This movie went away from what the bible actually says about Mary Magdelene.  This movie showed Mary Magdelene as the adulterous whom the Jews wanted to throw stones for her act.  Mary Magdelene was possessed by seven devils of which Jesus exercised and was not the adulterous depicted in the bible..  If you want the story of Jesus that sticks mostly to what the bible says, then Jesus of Nazareth is your best bet.

B00908DDZM|5.0|Transcends what? Age, race, socioeconomic class, you pick. It doesn't get much better than this... incredibly solid flow, amazing production and a strange kind of synergy that's hard to explain. It really feels like these two are going to end up being one of *those* partnerships where something magic happens when they work together; RL's production is innovative, and full of risks that pay off over and over, and most importantly, it feels like M's voice and flow were specially engineered to fit these beats. There's a line (a great line) in one of the songs that laments how Otherside (a previously released, amazing song) wasn't written by M it was \\"written by God.\\" He may not be able to see it yet, but I have a feeling that in five years from now some of these songs are going to seem that same way to him..
B0087YYHZU|5.0|The Blu-Ray restoration is amazing, you can really tell the difference when you watch the special features that show clips of the original version.  This is an amazing movie, showing dance at its best.  The special feature highlighting modern day choreographers saying that this film is the standard for dance as it incorporates many genres of dance in one film that has a great story.  Gene Kelly makes the most difficult dance routines look effortless. Debbie Reynolds says that doing Singing in the Rain was the hardest thing in her life as was giving birth.  The chemistry worked with all the staff that produced a great classic movie.  The special features make this Blu-Ray disc even better.  If you like musicals and dance, then you will love this movie.
0525953728|3.0|I reviewed the book for the site :[...] the site on the United-States most read by the French: my opinion was that the raid against Ben Laden was a \\"kill operation\\" without any intention to bring Ben Laden alive back to the States. The fact that a lawyer was present and gave advise to the Seals before going had the intention of covering the soldiers and the US government in case of the death of Ben Laden: he died while fighting which is not the case according to the book. Even when seriously wounded on the floor and no harm possibly done to the seals he was coldly executed and they made sure he was dead. This was to avoid an annoying trial in the States.  The book reveals a truth contrary to the official version of Ben Laden death.

0525953728|5.0|I picked this book up more over the curiosity of what training, missions and what their actual lifestyles are like. Of course we all can speculate that to some extent.  Hearing a first hand account has given me a new appreciation for these fine individuals that pretty much give up their own lives for our Country.  I cannot give them enough praise for their devotion.  They are all top notch people in their own right.  Thanks goes out to not only them but to their families for supporting them and most likely not even knowing what dangers they are in out in the field.  I cannot even imagine the stress their families experience while they are on an actual mission.  God Bless them and theirs.  It is a shame they never got that beer promised at the White House. If I was the Commander in Chief I would of thrown them and their families a party like none other.  I cannot thank them enough for getting OBL.  There is a lot of controvery about this book, but I do not see any evidence of \\"secrets\\" given out that would cause any future missions or Seal teams any problems.  I'm personally glad he wrote this book.  This isn't the type of book I normally would read but I have to say it was a page turner and fascinating.  Thank you for the ride!
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful classic novel. It is the captivating story of two people almost losing the opportunity of finding happiness together by being proud and making incorrect assumptions about each other through the influences of others. The era is one of a leisurely life spent in rambling homes, going to balls and seeking romance. He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well. Throughout the book, the author is so clever in getting the reader to understand the good and bad tension that exists between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett.  It's the kind of book you can't put down when you're reading it and the kind that can be read over and over again.

Now he needs to get the imagination juices going to dream up some plots like this one. I particularly like the comment about \\"you-know-who\\" taking all the credit. Need to tie his hands and feet behind him and see if he can do 50 meters under water. Might improve our lot!

The two are 10 years apart.<br /><br />Born Jonathan Lee Miller 15 November 1972 (age 40) - first acting jobs in 1983.<br /><br />Born Romola Sadie Garai 6 August 1982 (age 30)  - first acting jobs in 2000.<br /><br />Now I can understand the confusion because Johnny has such a yummy baby face.  But he is 10 years older.

Colin Firth (who rightfully received the Academy Award) plays Albert \\"Bertie\\" George who becomes King George VI.<br /><br />The acting was really good. It was well casted, directed, etc. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush were well casted together. Their friendship was genuine.  Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce both did a good job on their performances.<br /><br />I liked this movie the most compared to any other British royalty or political movie I've seen. \\"King's Speech\\" had warmth and depth to it. When I feel in the mood to watch a Brit royal theme, then this is the movie.
B008G12ERC|2.0|I am a huge fan of Muse, I have been since the very beginning. Initially it was the emotion of Bellamy's voice that drew me to the band, I could feel the emotion of every song. Most of their albums, there were very few songs I disliked. I guess I had super high expectations for \\"The 2nd Law\\", but unfortunately I find myself highly disappointed. I enjoy when bands dabble with new sounds and progress and grow but I also feel that fans have a core reason or two why they love the band, and a band needs to keep that to keep a fan. I didn't feel the emotion of the album, I wasn't overcome with any feeling except disgust when listening to it. It entirely seems as though the band just felt like throwing a idea together and used their vastly eclectic musical influences and saturated the songs with those influences, to the point of hearing the actual artist over their own sound. I think the band spent more time stretching and searching for who they could be, rather than cherishing and enhancing who they were. It is a failed attempt in my eyes at progressing their sound.<br /><br />Supremacy - The chorus reminded me exactly of Led Zeppelin, the influence was so prominent as far as sound, but certainly not lyrically. The lyrics were in regards to conquering and overcoming something but I felt the absence of any emotion. It was vapid.<br /><br />Madness - I love the electronica sound that Muse is experimenting with but the lyrics were so corny and the \\"Ma Ma Ma Madness\\" was annoying and overall it felt reminiscent of a George Micheal sound.<br /><br />Panic Station - Okay, honestly...I cracked up. The lyrics sing \\"You've arrived at the Panic Station\\".... no no, it should be - \\"You've arrived at the CORNY Station\\". I mean I know they worked with some artists or producers from Stevie Wonder, but Stevie Wonder has a defined niche in the industry that shouldn't be tapped by other artists, especially not British, electro-rockers, lol. Funk is just not their thing.<br /><br />Prelude/Survival - I wanted to like this song, I really did... but I was so distracted through out the song by the annoying back up waling of both the female and male singers. I just wanted to shut them up, turn them off and listen to Bellamy sing. I wish they hadn't added them in, it ruined the song for me.<br /><br />Follow Me - Despite it's lyrical downfall, I essentially enjoyed this song. The electronica complements the song, doesn't drown it out. It's simplistic not entirely impressive but at least listenable.<br /><br />Animals - Not horrible but flavorless, dry, boring bland. Once again, I am searching for my emotional connection..I want to hear Bellamy take me somewhere but he just leaves me standing there.<br /><br />Explorers - I'm on the fence. I like it but then again..I felt something amiss. I certainly can confirm my interest in the song may only be because I love Freddie Mercury and this song reminded me so much of him, but certainly - that is not a reason for me to love a song by Muse. Muse isn't Freddie Mercury or Queen.<br /><br />Big Freeze - Dude, U2 -regurgitated U2 ambiance.<br /><br />Save Me and Liquid State - All I gotta say is, there is a reason Bellamy sings and writes the songs. Stick to your bass man.<br /><br />Unsustainable - I love the sound of the song, but not from Muse. This is just not what Muse does. It isn't what I listen to Muse for. If I want to listen to a song like this, I will listen to Skrillex. Understand, Bellamy - just cause Sonny Moore did From First to Last and then solo crossed over to dubstep, doesn't mean you can. He just bailed and went solo, you're still in Muse, so do what Muse does best. Geez<br /><br />Isolated System - Musically gorgeous, wish you sang...if you had...I might have loved it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a grade D at best. I don't find myself hungry to listen to the album again. Muse still has songs or albums you can't stop playing... like Origin, Absolution, Black Holes, Resistance.... but you'll justhave to keep listening to those until they recover from \\"The 2nd Law\\". \\"2nd Law\\" is musically indulgent, lyrically slumbering, emotionally vapid, confusing and all out disappointing.have to keep listening to those until they recover from \\"The 2nd Law\\". \\"2nd Law\\" is musically indulgent, lyrically slumbering, emotionally vapid, confusing and all out disappointing.

0553801473|2.0|This was a real disappointment. Although I enjoyed the 1st couple of books, it was a real effort for me to get through this one. This book series has gone from a well-written tale with suspense in almost every chapter to a long-winded soap opera where each installment contains less real substance.<br /><br />In this book, the same 3 storylines persist: Impending threat from beyond the Wall; warring for control of the Seven Kingdoms; Daenerys and her dragons in the east (Will she EVER come to Westeros?) Instead of bringing the story to a climax/denouement, Martin continues to drag it out. There is too much repetition and seemingly unnecessary characters or chapters. Some examples include the chapters about Quentyn Martell or Victarion Greyjoy. What real value do they have to the main story? This same question can be asked about the chapter with Daenerys walking alone in the Dothraki sea of grass. Most of this chapter is a review of events covered in earlier books (since who could remember it all after 5000 pages). The only really interesting point in this chapter was who she meets - described in the last paragraph. Why didn't the author just scrap the rest and start with that scene?? Redundancies were also noted in the 1st half of the book which was filled with descriptions of burned out villages, razed castles and mutilated bodies - very dark and disturbing. How many times does the author want to describe carnage?<br /><br />A good story has to deliver its climax/point; otherwise the audience loses interest. Maybe some criticism should go to the editor, who should have encouraged the author to delete such repetitions and extraneous pages.  Why keep 1000 verbose pages, if the story could have been better told in half that space?<br /><br />One oddity was that 3/4 of the way through, Martin scraps using character names for the titles and instead tries things like \\"The Queen's Hand\\" or \\"The Discarded Knight\\". Using the character names tied the book together. This arbitrary change seems to suggest that Martin has indeed lost his focus in this series...much as Dany loses her purpose in Meereen. Tyrion's escapades and wit were the book's one saving grace.<br /><br />Reviews have described Martin as the next Tolkien. I initially agreed with that. Now, after over 5000 pages and no end to the story in sight, that comparison no longer holds true. Tolkien gave his story closure (which is what made that series phenomenal) ...we're still waiting on Martin (and getting bored).<br /><br />As suggested by another reviewer, one wonders if rather than creating a good tale, he is now writing for future royalties or TV series??

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an easy and extremely entertaining read! The storyline is super depressing but sucks you in. Do not pick up this series if you have important things to do because you will just want to keep reading!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|when i first saw alien, the idea of a group of hapless miners being woken from sleep to go investigate what may be a distress call or else not get paid only to discover TWO alien races, one who got their butts handed to them by the other they unfortunately happened upon was SO intriguing! we never get to find out about the big aliens and who they are or where they came from! that made the whole universe seem big! that was awesome!<br /><br />but NOW... let me see if i got this right... the first group created us, followed our comings and goings enough to decide we're 'evil' and worthy of extermination, FORGOT where they put us, so they create the black goo so that when we eventually find them it will take care of the problem by creating creatures that kill us because they sense evil, is that it? when the scientists discover the evidence of the engineers running for their lives trying to hide from some unseen force, was that... the goo they created? but aren't they the creators of all life? why are they scared of anything? what are they running from?<br /><br />when they realize there's only one way to stop them going to earth and killing everyone, the pilot and a few other guys volunteer to die in a completely UNBELIEVABLE guesture of selflessness? there's NO sense of nervousness, no real thought of 'maybe there's some other way'... instead, 'sure! i'm ready to die today!'<br /><br />the movie LOOKS amazing. visually stunning... but the highbrow attempt at depth really didn't land for me...
B003B02O7I|4.0|Another legal thriller.  This is John Grisham in his signature style.  (as opposed to the Innocent Man, which I didn't care for)  I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option.  It was hard to put it down and kept me interested all the way to the end.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Having read many Amazon reviews on this feature, I decided not to be hasty and rent it on iTunes before purchasing it. I shoulda known just to buy the thing. What a waste of 4 dollars on a rental. It's great. The animation was fantastic, the colors looks vibrant, I felt a real tension during it. I suppose it wasn't as hyper-violent as people have come to expect, but lots of movie and television violence is so over the top that it's almost humiliating that we believe it's possible for people to survive it. I thought the balance of violence, injuries, realistic fighting motions, and above all, restraint by the production team kept this movie fast paced, fun, and leaving the viewer dying for more.<br /><br />I almost wish I hadn't watched it. I wanna see Part II really bad.<br /><br />NOTE: This is a animated movie of the classic comic The Dark Knight Returns, one of Batman's best stories. If you loved this movie, and you're looking for something to tide you over until Part II, check out the graphic novel, it's going for $7.49 used. That's a great price for a great Batman story.
B008602KQI|5.0|This film is an amazing achievement. Everything about it is so well-done. I have watched it many times and am still noticing details I never saw before. Gary Ross did an outstanding job.
1568363931|5.0|After reading all the great 5-star review of this book, I just had to buy this book to see what the rave was about.<br /><br />I have lived in Japan for more than 10 years and attended a few Japanese Culinary Schools, I agree that this book is worthy of it's many 5-star reviews.<br /><br />I liked the short intro-paragraph at the at the beginning of some of the recipes that gives the reader some background of the dish as eaten or prepared in Japan and the reasons for preparing  or cooking it in the \\"Japanese way\\".  Instructions are easy to follow and not intimidating even for the beginner Japanese Bento maker.  And remember Practice makes Perfect especially for making Tamagoyaki (pg 19)<br /><br />Overall the recipes are easy to follow and quick to prepare as illustrated by the timeline guides. The ingredients she uses are easily found at Asian Grocery Stores. This shows the author has given much thought to the availability of Japanese ingredients used in her recipes and made this book practical for those residing outside Japan.<br /><br />But if you are looking for a book with fancy beautiful pictures for each recipe, this is not the book for you. There are only 25 full-page photos and a measly 4 step-by-step photos for this 127-page book. This is not a step-by-step kind of cookbook and some of the cooking instructions are somewhat vague eg \\"saute till onions are translucent, till meat is browned, massage till vegetable are limp, de-seed cucumber, cut out tough vein of cabbage leave\\" that left my non-cooking American friend scratching her head.<br /><br />Some reviewers liked the \\"Variation Recipes\\" section at the end of each bento menu eg Pan-fried Chicken Nuggets & Ground Chicken Nuggets. I would have preferred \\"new\\" recipes as I rather have 150 totally \\"different\\" recipes than \\"repeats\\" of same dish.<br /><br />The author's blog site is also good - you can find many bento recipes there as well.<br /><br />But at only 7 cents a recipe, this 150-recipe book is good value for money. It's a keeper!
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I hear a lot of people raving about this series, so I tried it. But personally, it is not my kind of story. For those who like the genre it would be fine. But I am having a hard time finishing it.
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|The beginning  is very slow and hard to get into, but once u get to the middle it is a very fun, lighthearted piece.  I will say I don‘t think there is a clear point to the story other then <br />Life never turns out exactly as you plan.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Read the first and thought it o.k, but knew I had to read the second one just to find out what happens, as is the case with a cliff hanger. I read the third book 'cause I had all that time invested in the first two.  I knew by the end of the second book I had enough but once again had to see how it ends. The third book is not as good as the first and second.  It's almost as if the the writer is rambling, without a real story line. After a while even the sex parts of the book (which is the hook) gets old hat.  I was almost tempted to just go to the last chapter and see what happens and be done with it. I hope not to see a fourth book:)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is an excellent book and a must read for both teens and adults.  The characters are believable and you are rooting for Charlie the entire book.  I read this book in 3 days and then immediately went to see the movie.  Now I want to read the book again!
B0089IGUP4|4.0|For quite a few years I've waited for this album to be released, as I - like many fans - firmly believe the Gaslight Anthem are one of the few bands out there now who carry the torch of honest, raw rock n' roll from the heart.... and now that it's been out a few months, I think I can finally give a fair assessment. I have to admit, at first I was disappointed. Perhaps I had too great of expectations (see what I did there), but on my first listen, \\"Handwritten\\" as a whole sounded too much like a straightforward extension of 2010's \\"American Slang,\\" which I have never been able to more than moderately enjoy. \\"American Slang\\" substituted the blistering tempos and youthful energy of \\"The 59 Sound\\" with slicker, slower, and ultimately less satisfying mid-tempo numbers.<br /><br />So as mid-tempo songs like \\"Here Comes My Man,\\" \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" and \\"Keepsake\\" played in sequence during my first listen, my heart sank. It was two years ago all over again.<br /><br />But I kept listening. I put it into one of the CD slots in my car, and I'd listen on long drives. Slowly, very slowly, the songs began to work their way under my skin - not quite into my heart the way almost every song on \\"59\\" did, but I began really feeling them nonetheless. \\"Keepsake\\" outgrew its Tom Petty-esque riff and became a heartfelt tale of family struggle with an aching chorus. \\"Howl\\" went from a basic 2-minute rock blast with generic sing along \\"yeah yeah yeahs\\" into a \\"59\\"-like reflection on leaving the youthful stage of life and moving forward despite your fear, with a final lyric that sticks with you (\\"bless your words... bless your doubts\\"). \\"Biloxi Parish\\" is filled with hooks and great lyrics about dedication in love. And \\"Desire\\" follows, keeping the momentum high and, with its yearning lyrics, keeping the listener engaged on an emotional level as well.<br /><br />But, for as great as those songs may be, the album still isn't rock solid from front to back. \\"Here Comes My Man\\" and \\"MulhollandDrive\\" aren't bad, but in the context of the rest of the album they're clunkers. \\"Here Comes My Man\\" emulates Pearl Jam's emulation of a female perspective (in \\"Daughter\\"), but with no added dimension or observations to benefit the song and give it a deeper meaning as \\"Daughter\\" once did. Brian Fallon puts a lot of muscle into the vocals of \\"Too Much Blood\\", but the song doesn't have enough depth to warrant repeated listens. \\"The National Anthem\\" is pretty, but seems to be missing something.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are largely great as well - it was a crime to keep \\"Blue Dahlia\\" and its hooks off of the regular album, and Fallon's vocals in the cover of Nirvana's \\"Sliver\\" is almost indistinguishable from Cobain's original. I'm not blown off my feet by the Petty cover, but it's decent.<br /><br />Is \\"Handwritten\\" great? Yes, and no. Its heights are slightly lower in the atmosphere than \\"The 59 Sound,\\" but in the same atmosphere nonetheless. Its lows are still on par or slightly better than most of American Slang. It's not an adventurous album, and it doesn't feel as earnest as \\"59\\" still does, but it's admittedly difficult to replicate one of my favorite albums of all time - and I'm not sure I'd want the Gaslight Anthem to do that, anyway.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Fresh yet revisted, these songs remind me of something I have heard before, but yet I haven't...  Fantastic album.  Gave me goose bumps the first listen through.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am a college student, and being tight for money I do not buy anything I don't need. With that said, I pre-ordered this CD in early September and have been waiting for it since. It is the first physical CD I have bought in my life, and I am proud of that fact. Macklemore (real name Ben Haggerty) has continually evolved, but kept true to his poetic roots such as \\"The End\\" from the Language of My World Album. He is making huge gains not only in the hip hop/rap world, but by allowing strong social commentary to be passed to our younger generations (such as college students)that wouldn't otherwise reach us. I have been following him since 2010 when I was first introduced to him, and I have seen him go from \\"Macklemore? Who is that? to \\"Oh yea, I recognize him\\" to \\"THRIFT SHOP LOVE THIS SONG BRO!\\" He is gaining popularity by the second. His music continues to be deep, making commentary about materialism (wings), appearance and stereotypes, freedom of choice (including gay marriage obviously with same love, and many other current day issues that should be addressed in music. His music is catchy enough for people to want to listen to, and advanced and complex enough to keep people listening rather than just being a party jam. The album itself is absolutely spectacular, and you can see the effort Ben and Ryan put into the album, as well as the effort they put into their personal lives with songs such as Thin Line. This inspiring story of rising up in the hip hop world contrasts his earlier albums where he talks about a lot of drug problems (otherside)and obstacles that he had to overcome to pursue his dream. The music has catchy songs such as Can't Hold Us, Thrift Shop, slower simpler songs like Same Love and Neon Cathedral, and takes oldschool music influences and creates a newschool sound.<br /><br />I'm proud to be a supporter of Mr. Haggerty and Mr. Lewis. They are taking hip hop back to its roots, telling stories with their music, as well as developing it by inputtingstrong direct social commentary that makes people think. With our current generation being bombarded by half naked women in music videos, loud electronic beats, and alcohol as the forerunners powering the music industry it is reassuring for me to hear people blasting thrift shop, even if they aren't fully aware of the meaning behind it in regards to our spending habits. In order for my generation to stay grounded we need to put some thought into our lives, where pop culture is driving us, and if we really need all the technology that is continually coming out. I'm just a normal guy, not some social activist, not a frat bro, not a gaming nerd. Macklemore's album has made me realize that the statement I just made is false. I have friends from each of those \\"groups\\" and at heart they are all just normal people. We need to do something to get rid of stereotypes, and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have risked years of work on this album, straying from the typical popular rap path, in order to do something about the problems in this world like stereotyping. If you would like to see rap change, if you would like to listen to thought provoking and moving music, if you would like to hear what it sounds like when drums, trumpets, chimes, guitar, and passion comes together, then I suggest you buy this album and support Macklemore. They care about their music and their fans and will not disappoint, just as this album has not.<br /><br />p.s. if you are looking for more music similar to this check out Common Market and Blue Scholars let YouTube guide you from there.
B0031RS7EK|4.0|Great book similar to most of the authors other titles but different enough to keep you interested throughout. Prefer a finished tail end then to be left wondering
0345803493|4.0|Fifty Shades Darker is the second book of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. At the end of the first book Anastasia Steele leaves Christian after he beats her in \\"The Red Room of Pain\\" which is what she calls it. Now in the second one she realizes that she is madly in love with him and wants him back but she doesn't know if she can fulfill all his wants and needs. This book still has many sex scenes and kinky things happening in it but they are starting to make more and more connections in their love life and it's not all just about the sex. Can Anastasia please Christian with having a \\"vanilla\\" relationship or is she going to have to step out of her comfort zone again to please Christian? This book is really interesting and hard to put down. If you are looking just for a love story I would probably choose something else. This story can get pretty graphic and \\"dirty.\\" If you don't like reading about kinky sex games and scenes I would not recommend this book. There's a mix between sex and love in this book and if you can handle that then you will really enjoy reading this book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I like reading romance and mystery books. This book contained both of these elements. I couldn't put it down.
0316228532|1.0|I had enjoyed HP and was looking forward to reading \\"The Casual Vacancy\\". After 15 minutes I tossed it in the trash can, where it belongs. The constant swearing and blasphemy was too much for me.
0525953728|4.0|A good view of what a Navy Seal experiences in combat. I will never know exactly the emotions felt, much less the effort, training,etc. these men went through because I wasn't there! Bless them! Yes, I recommend this book!
1402270275|5.0|This is a story with likable passionate characters living in a steampunk London society. What an exciting novel! Honoria Todd and her siblings are in hiding in the slums of Whitechapel. They are being sought by an evil that wishes to destroy them. Blade is the notorious rogue and devil of Whitechapel who will be their protector. Honoria and Blade are meant for each other despite her strong will and his need to control. Together they will defeat their common enemy or die trying. If you love adventure, the paranormal and romance, this novel has it all plus more. I look forward to the next book in this new series.[[ASIN:1402270275 Kiss of Steel]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Mr. Grey and his fifty shades were amazing. You have to read the entire series, its a page turner. can't wait until the fourth installment.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Slow to begin with, but picks up as you continue to read usual Reacher novel- a little thin on the plot.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Finally entered the Kindle tablet world, and of course had to get Angry Birds. It's a great game with many variations, and I mainly use it during commercial times on TV, late at night........ Super time killer!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read Gone Girl: A Novel this past weekend, and I really couldn't put it down.  A lot of twists and turns, some interesting insights to love and marriage, suspenseful, and even thought provoking. I didn't particularly *like either of the two protaganists, but they were interesting, albeit just a bit shocking (and I don't shock very easily). An interesting contemplation of marriage. I liked it, I liked it alot.<br /><br />It was very well written, and complex. Somewhat reminiscent of a Hitchcock movie, a tiny bit noir.<br /><br />The author has written two books before this, and I suspect I will be visiting them soon.
B005HSL626|5.0|Another great free game to while away the evening hours, or just while waiting for something else getting ready to happen.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|We love the DVD and my grandkids keep asking to watch it! I recommend it to anyone who likes music and dance.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The storyline of this Defending Jacob is excellent. But too much law lingo made it confusing to understand. I constantly found myself scanning over the parts that got into too much detail regarding the law. I did however, feel a pull towards Jacob...wanting to defend and protect him. As a mom, I felt bad for what he was going through. Because of that pull, I didn't want to put the book down. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the education in law.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is fun you would get it you try to get as many coins you can get and go to the next level Get it get it!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|My review of vevo is this - 1 good point and one bad point:<br /><br />The good point is that it is a great way of watching music videos new and old.<br /><br />The bad point is with the promotions/advertising - when I want to listen to and watch a classic music video from 80s/90s I don't want to see pictures of artists like Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, 1 direction, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj and others that children and early teens like.  Please keep those artists limited to videos from that generation and if you do want to advertise other artists make them relevant to the music video thats being watched.  Either that or don't promote artists that are completely irrelevant to the music video being watched and have no promotional art/pictures at all.<br /><br />That way you won't receive any negative comments from viewers/listeners who are fans of the video.<br /><br />But otherwise keep up the good work and with that suggestion I believe more people will enjoy vevo.  Have a nice day!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app for my Kindle Fire! At first I couldn't figure out how to navigate to the different categories but finally noticed when you  swipe from left to right it pulls the category screen from the left. Aside from the occasional crashing, though not that much, 2-3 times, I love it!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I liked the movie. The story line is based off of the game by the same name. As far a science fiction goes it has an entertaining story to it.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Colleen Hoover is obliviously a huge Avett Brothers fans.  I love how she used quotes from their songs to start off each chapter.  I fell very hard for both of the characters in this book and wanted to just see them happy and together.  I read this book very quickly and couldn't put it down.  I was very pleased to see there was also a sequel to it.  Anyone with children in high school or young adults should also read this book.  It sends a great message on responsibiltly and taking care of your family.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Super cute chick flick, even my husband enjoyed this one! Great cast, very funny and heartfelt. There is even some manly humor to this one.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|The show itself is great, but it is very frustrating to watch it on Amazon.  It takes forever to load, and then when it does, it often stops and has to load again.  Can this be fixed?
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Another extraordinary performance by Johnny Depp! Very original and interesting twist on the vampire genre. We will be buying this one for our collection.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is such a great DVD!  Fun to have it playing with guests over. We all enjoy remembering the songs.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Wonderful special effects, awesome story line, great performances from all actors! This movie is definately not your average Snow White. Will watch again and again!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a fun highly addictive game. You will love every minute of it. The pinpoint accuracy is amazing. Try it you'll thank me later!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Ok, we all know that the story line was simple and that there was zero chemistry between \\"Mike\\" and his love interest. But what we do know is that this movie is fun! It is about time that a movie came out for the women! This movie has so much eye candy and makes you want to get up off your bum. Don't expect to watch something with a complicated plot, it isn't here. But do expect to have a blast watching this movie! And by the way, my husband said it wasn't a half bad movie. So enjoy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book anxious to start the next one hoping it will be as good. the movie will be my next quest
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love hidden object games and the murderer mystery twist makes it more than your average hidden object game. it awesome. definitely would recommend.
0316228532|3.0|I never touched Rowling before, so I cannot and will not be comparing her potter work to this. I will not be holding her in any godlike regard. I have read The Casueal Vacancy with clear eyes. I understand the risk an author takes to offer something new to their public, and so I commend Rowling for that.<br /> I listened to the book and it didn't get really interesting until hour 8 (there were 18).  I feel that with an aggressive editor, Rowling could have easily cut a major percentage of this book without extensive loss.  She just explained everything and everyone in much detail.  Perhaps a little too much.<br />The story featured in The Casual Vacancy is pretty basic, what happens to a town when one of the most important people on the council dies?  What happens when people feel their way of life is threatened and will stop at nothing to keep everything the same?  Basic story - strange, irksome,  and at times compelling characters.<br />As I listened, the first thing I thought was - wow the men in this book are severely flawed idiots that I wouldn't like to meet....<br />Then as time went on I thought - wow, the women in the book are severely flawed idiots that I wouldn't like to meet.<br />I've seen complaints about Rowling's character development, but I honestly don't think she has a problem there; I think her character development is fine,fantastic even but I think we are quite uncomfortable with the characters she has developed.  The thing you come to ask yourself is - are we are as a people really like this?  And I think the sad truth is - yes, we are quite pathetic.  This can be a quite humbling realization to grasp.  I actually wouldnt mind knowing what happens to Andrew and Gaia and the others.  I found that I thought of the Crystals of the world way after the book was done.  I would definitely read Rowling again.  No Doubt.<br />For the record - Gavin is the most deplorable character  I have ever read, and if I ever meet anyone like him in real life I will waste no time flinging him far away from me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love, love Pinterest!!!  So nice to be able to go to one place and find things and be able to go back to them so easy!  No more bookmarking a thousand websites or not being able to find something again!
B001CD6FKI|4.0|This one was marketed as a summer blockbuster.  It's no better or worse than typical summer fare.  It's certainly better than those cynical \\"Transformers\\" movies.  Why did it fail to gain an audience on initial release?  I can surmise that its audience were probably forty-somethings like myself who didn't go to the movies as much.  Flaws in the movie are overlength(2 hours, 15 minutes) and possible preachiness.  The movie espouses an anti-corporate bias.  Strange because it was distributed by Warner Communications.  The Wachowski Brothers don't just deliver the message they bludgeon it.  Regardless, if you can overlook the preachiness \\"Speed Racer\\" is a lot of fun.  The effects are jaw-dropping and they don't overwhelm the story or performances which are generally good.  It's not often that you can call a movie that was probably budgeted over $100,000,000 as a sleeper but this one is worth checking out.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I pretty much despised this book-did not have empathy for any of the characters  except Go. Like watching a train wreck, but a slow-motion boring one
B00471TLZS|5.0|I received the DVD in great condition.The package was also in good condition. Also the product was on time as promised. The DVD has great picture and sound quality since the movie is many years old. I recommend everyone to purchase the movie and enjoy the show.
B007SGM084|3.0|I haven't finished the 2nd book yet, but I found the first one to be somewhat boring and the 2nd is only a little bit better.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Some tiles are hard to recognize, seasons, directions, etc.. I wish they had a selection of music to listen to while playing.
B004I744AS|4.0|This app is exactly what I expected, and exactly as advertised - even does the translations if you have wi-fi.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It took me some time to get through book one, very well written but I wasn't sure if I'd like this 'dark' world. Then I got into the flow, finished book one, then book two and immediately ordered book three... these stories are full of wonder, but no 1, the characters are real... so, highly recommended...
B008XG1X18|3.0|I've enjoyed using this app, but it crashes &amp; freezes quite often when I try to repin things. When it's working,  it's  great!
B00005J9PB|5.0|I like the movie alot, but when i want to watch it on a DVD player on the TV i have to set the region to 2 ( german setting) but it does play in English but it only does that on the PC not DVD. bet its good enough since i got a custom tower with many video players and out puts.
B006YW6KX4|5.0|I have always loved this film. The great performances by so many great actors and actresses.  Rosalind Russel in what I consider one of her best performances. (next to Auntie Mame).  Arthur Oconnel as a shlub five and dime owner. Kim Novak as all beauty and Susan Strasbourg as her all brains sister. And of course ne'er do well William Holden. Braggadocio personified.  But the highlight of the film, set to music, is when Hal and Madge begin the most erotic scene in a movie I have ever seen, where everyone still has thier clothes on.  The dance, set to Moonglow, on the pier, is just AWESOME. It gives me goose bumps just to think about it.  The movement, the touch, the way you can see thier souls connect all of a sudden when he pulls her close and intertwines his hand with hers. What a moment. And the music, perfectly timed violins merge with the jazz riff.  They do not make movies like that anymore.  At least none that I have seen.  Wow!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this free Bible app!  I greatly enjoy their &quot;plans&quot; for devotionals, Bible read, etc.  You need to download it.  GLORY TO G-d.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book is amazing in the fact that she could even climb the PCT alone. I'm about the same age as her when she started this trip and I would never even consider it. This part of the book left me amazed. However, I find her extremely frustrating. Who starts using heroin because her one night stand needs a fix? Or gives up on their marriage because her mother dies? I would recommend this book to anyone because there are a lot of great lessons to be learned here.
B008OJ291W|1.0|I have been a devout ELO fan for over 30 years now. I have every American album, almost every British album. I bought most of the CDs from England and then bought them again when they were remastered. I have the extra tracks from the obscure B-sides. I have CDs from the ELO offshoot Violinski, and the vinyl to the Tandy/Morgan album. I saw Xanadu eight times in the theater because I was 15, had the time, and wanted it to beat out Star Wars as the movie I saw most in a theater.<br />I saw them live 3 times. Once for their Time tour in the US. I saw them at Birmingham Heartbeat, and then there was their final live show at Wembley Stadium horrifyingly enough OPENING for Rod Stewart.<br />So yeah, I'm a big fan. But something happened on the way to 2012. First it was the whole ELO Part II debacle. Bev and Jeff fighting... it was like watching the divorce of two friends. Then there was Zoom, the 2000 \\"ELO\\" album that included a whole whopping one member of the band, Jeff (with Richard in for some keyboards). Then there was the re-recording of Xanadu to kick out the only singer who helped ELO get a UK #1, Olivia Newton-John. Next, hearing \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" on the US TV commercials and realizing that they were not the originals (very close) but were in fact Jeff's re-recordings of them.<br />And now there's this. A full \\"ELO\\" album covering ELO. It's useless, senseless, and all under the guise of better technology and production ability. In reality, I would bet it's a further way to crowd the other members who did the original recordings out of royalties.<br />Jeff forgot on the way to production nirvana that the original recordings can be perfect in their imperfection. The off-key improv at the end of \\"Showdown,\\" the rushed singing in \\"Do Ya,\\" Kelly's background vocals in half of the original titles here, Bev's drumming (he can bash them like no one else can), the list goes on.<br />It makes me feel like Jeff has reduced his illustrious past with one of my all time favorite bands to a one-hit wonder who has to keep re-recording the songs to continue to get the royalties.

B000V0ON52|5.0|Katherine Woods' simple and beautiful translation is the only one that does justice to The Little Prince. (See notes.) The five stars rating is for hers. Published by Harcourt in 1943 and again in 1971, Katherine Woods' translation is \\"the essential\\" --- the translation loved and quoted by English-speaking people around the world, even by members of English- and French-speaking Canadian Parliament! It's also quoted throughout English literature from its debut in 1943 to date (2012), and just this October by speakers in a world conference. But the Katherine Woods translation is currently OUT OF PRINT, so snatch up used copies while you may!<br /><br />WARNING: there is a \\"new translation\\" out by Richard Howard, and I accidentally got one. Ouch! His \\"New\\" translation purges meaning, and is not worth the money. It gives a falseness to one of the most sincere stories ever written.<br /><br />Howard's lacks beauty, and is at times unintelligible: It simply does not make sense. Since Howard has no apparent understanding of the truths expressed in The Little Prince, it is not to be wondered at. One important example says it all: The fox's \\"secret\\" told to the little prince in parting ---<br /><br />Woods' translation reads: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" She uses the beautiful rhetorical mode: \\"What is essential...\\" Compare, if you know French, Antoine de Saint Exupéry's original French text: \\"...on ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invsible pour les yeux.\\" (The French yeux means eyes, but in English we often speak of the eye, a poetic, symbolic replacement for eyes.) \\"L'essentiel\\" is in the same mode as is \\"Les Misérables\\" -- neither translate exactly into English because in English they are adjectives, not nouns. \\"Les Misérables\\" may be translated as \\"The Miserable Ones,\\" with less poetic effect. Likewise, \\"L'essentiel\\" might be rendered literally \\"The essential things\\" or put in the rhetorical form \\"What is essential...\\"<br /><br />If Richard Howard wanted to make the statement \\"clearer\\", his translation would have to have read: \\"That which is essential is invisible to the eye\\" -- wordy, and prosy, but it keeps the meaning. But Howard doesn't do that. His \\"new\\" translation of the same line reads: \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" Huh? \\"Anything essential is invisible to the eyes\\"? Far from expressing Antoine de Saint Exupéry's meaning, this generalization means, in effect, nothing. Better to have translated the line in absolutely 2nd-grade-French-student style as: \\"One only sees well with the heart. The 'essential' is invisible for the eyes\\" which is nearer the original, literally speaking, though lacking a syntactic understanding of French, a lack Howard shares.<br /><br />Katherine Woods' exquisite translation captures the essence of this line in French for the English reader. \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" Quintessential, no line in the book is more important. It epitomizes her entire translation and Antoine de Saint Exupéry's message. It is ironic that, in translating The Little Prince, Richard Howard should lose \\"that which is essential,\\" and that he should be unable to \\"see with his heart.\\"<br /><br />You can tell the difference between the two translations by the covers. Woods' shows the little prince on a white background; Howard's is on midnight blue. But check the ISBNs!<br /><br />One of Amazon.com's Editorial Reviews on Howard's translation says that \\"Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect.\\" To be true, this would have been better written thus:<br /><br />\\"Katherine Woods uses poetic devices and a didactic accent to wonderful effect, capturing the essence and meaning of Antoine de Saint Exupéry's classic in a timeless translation. Unhappily and unfortunately, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified in a words-only translation, and he wanders off the mark, obscuring what were otherwise truths both simple and profound, giving the text a slightly wooden effect.\\"<br /><br />To get the Katherine Woods' translation, make sure you are buying ISBN: 0-15-246507-3 (for example). As for Howard's translation, \\"NEW\\" is not better; it's just \\"new.\\" Woods' translation is the one I read, and helped me to understand why I grieved so when my great grandmother died. We'd spent so much time with her. And, as the fox says to the little prince in explaining why HIS rose is so important to him, \\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\" It also helps me keep in mind what I'm doing with my time, and why. If I watch T.V. the most, then T.V. becomes the most important. If I pass time with my family, they become the most important.<br /><br />Another always-to-be-remembered example of a passage from Woods' translation dealing with the interaction of the little prince and the fox. When the little prince has to say goodbye to the fox, the fox says, \\"Ah, I shall cry.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's your own fault,\\" said the little prince. \\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.<br /><br />\\"But now you are going to cry!\\" said the little prince.<br /><br />\\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.<br /><br />\\"Then it has done you no good at all!\\"<br /><br />\\"It has done me good,\\" said the fox, \\"because of the color of the wheat fields.\\"<br /><br />Before the little prince tamed the fox, the wheat field had \\"nothing to say to\\" the fox. \\"But,\\" he had said to the little prince, \\"you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to thewind in the wheat...\\"<br /><br />I used to dislike giant sunflowers. Then I discovered that someone I love likes them very much. So we planted some and cared for them together. Now, when I see giant sunflowers, I remember him and my heart is happy. I understand. Because I read, and re-read, Woods' translation of The Little Prince from the time I was a child and a teen, when it meant even more to me because I grasped the deeper meaning. I still read it, a staple. It is as beautiful today as it was 40 years ago.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />SOURCES:<br /><br />Katherine Woods' superior translation: NY: Harvest/HBJ Book, Harcourt, 1971, pp. 83, 86, 87.

Unfortunately, the pictures are in grayscale, not color, and the paper is similar to newsprint. The differences in translation, what few there are, are not necessarily better, just in nuance.<br /><br />There is are also two audio editions, both translated by Richard Hamlet and read by Humphrey Bower [[ASIN:B0023AP7T4 The Little Prince]] and [[ASIN:1742851363 The Little Prince]]. Richarch Hamlet's translation is also inferior, with much lost in translation. Compare the Katherine Woods' translation, if you have it, to the sample recording at [[ASIN:B0023AP7T4 The Little Prince]]<br />The audio CD's are performed by the same reader so I assume the same translator, Richard Hamlet.<br /><br />The Kindle edition [[ASIN:B008QYT7DI The Little Prince]] is unfortunately the Richard Howard translation.<br /><br />-------------
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down, if the battery hadn't quit, I wouldn't have either. Starts easy and progresses upward in difficultly. Great app.
B0090XJJTQ|4.0|I liked this movie a lot, it had a lot of action and Sherlock and Watson were played well by the stars of this movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book would not be for everyone but I liked it. I started with 50 Shades of Grey, and my curiosity propelled me on to 50 Shades Darker. I liked this book much better than the first, because it's happier and the heroin stays true to herself and grows in all kinds of ways. It's probably very unrealistic, and not what I'd usually read, but it's written well despite what everyone feigns to the contrary. For a break away from reality, intellectualism, and a walk on the wilder (and sexy) side, give this one a try.
0345803485|2.0|Like many others, I bought into the hype. \\"oh my.\\" first off, Mr Grey is only 27. In modern times, I find it improbable to believe he is that accomplished in either the bed or boardroom. Unless he's a vampire .... And I already read that series. Being 27, he is neither mysterious or deviant, just 27. And a brat. Who does need to be spanked. The characters are repugnant and the writing juvenile. The book may bette intriguing if the characters were a decade older and more defined. Also, it should take place in England were the writer is clearly from. I mean seriously, a 27 year old who doesn't want a serious girlfriend but instead wants to play (safe) sex games? Hello!!!!!! Almost every 27 educated urban 27 year old in America. I feel myself getting dumber with every page I read.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|One of the Greatest Movies of all time is made even better on Blu Ray. This movie is packed with extras. I spent a whole day just watching all the extra footage on the 2nd Blu Ray disc. The HD really shines on this Blu Ray version of James Cameron's epic love story on the ill fated Titanic and the sound is fantastic on a surround sound system. Even if you already own this on DVD you will definitely want to pick this up on Blu Ray!
B0013O123Q|2.0|i decided to give the movie a chance and watched it..don't like the fact its presented backwards..i couldn't stand the spinning camera view..at one point i'm asking myself what the hell is happening..those graphic scenes were really well made and a bit realistic witch grabbed my attention..the rape scene did go on a bit to long but i could feel the desperation and terror she must of felt..so the death scene,the rape scene,and the beautiful Monica Bellucci naked are the only strong points in the movie..so all in all for me it was not a bad movie but also not a well made movie..did i mention the spinning camera? yeah that was horrible
B005G02RIC|5.0|Beautiful production. The singing is wonderful. Sound is excellent, despite being recorded outdoors in a huge arena. Being outside, however, allowed for some huge sets (including cannons), which were accompanied by some gorgeous costumes. In addition, a great value. What more can you ask for?

B0093URN4E|5.0|I have to preface this review by stating that Converge is my favorite band. I listen to them much more often than is likely healthy. I've bought all the albums. Heck, they've been the inspiration behind multiple tattoos. Yeah, I like Converge and this review is going to reflect that. Still reading? Awesome; let's get into this thing.<br /><br />All We Love We Leave Behind is the best album of the year. I'm not going to tiptoe around it. Converge has yet to release a poor album; everything in their catalogue is nothing short of brilliant. From the earlier madness of When Forever Comes Crashing to fan favorite Jane Doe, all the way to the aural madness that is Axe To Fall, every release has had unique characteristics that drive it to greatness while never sacrificing that trademarked, undeniable Converge sound. Heavy. Angry. Emotional. Relentless. On All We Love We Leave Behind, Converge make the next logical step and release quite possibly their best work yet and one of the finest pieces of art I've ever experienced.<br /><br />AWLWLB begins with lead single \\"Aimless Arrow,\\" an infectious and emotional tune that sets the tone for the rest of the album. Upon initial hearing, I was given the impression that the new album would be similar in style to You Fail Me. Then \\"Trespasses\\" played. I kid you not when I call it the heaviest thing they've recorded. Immediately, it's made clear that Converge is not messing around. Never once do they let up; every track is gripping and left me breathless. Even slower songs, such as \\"Coral Blue,\\" don't really give you a chance to catch your breath. The tone throughout is incredible; listen to the title track for proof that Converge do it better than anyone. It's not as simply bleak as You Fail Me; it's bleak, gripping, urgent, and dark. I'm not sure what inspired the feel of this disc, but I can say right now that it wasn't fun.<br /><br />Onwards to Kurt Ballou. On past releases, he has proven to be one of the best riff writers whileslowly gaining ground as one of the more technically proficient players in rock/metal. On Axe To Fall, he showed off some incredible chops. As with every other aspect, he turns it up to a whole new level. His riffs are the heaviest yet and when he plays a solo or a lick, it's faster, more impressive, and leaves you in the dust. Then we have Nate Newton on bass. He's always stood as the driving background force, giving Converge their sheer power. Yep, that's been stepped up too. Newton is one of the hidden gems of hardcore; without him, I guarantee Converge wouldn't sound this heavy or powerful. And of course, who can forget Ben Koller? He's stood as my favorite drummer for quite some time now, thanks to his work primarily on Axe To Fall and Jane Doe, and his work here is drastically improved. His more liberal use of double bass adds an extra layer of strength without being gimmicky in the slightest.<br /><br />And then there's Jacob Bannon. What more can be said about the hardest working man in music? In virtually every way has he stepped up his game on AWLWLB. His cleans are great and he still has the most ferocious scream in music. Arguably his most impressive feat is how natural he sounds. Everything sounds like a live take, giving the album a raw feel that is often attempted, but rarely is successful. His lyrics are just as impressive as everything else he has done, which comes as absolutely no surprise to this reviewer. And the artwork he designed? He really is one of the most impressive and talented artists out there; it's impossible to not fall in love with everything he creates.<br /><br />I can't get over how good All We Love We Leave Behind is. It's the best band in hardcore at the top of their game. Every moment is breathtaking and never once does anything feel remotely stale. Every member has drastically improved, and considering how good they have been for a couple of decades now, it's incredible how far they have come. One of the defining characteristics of Converge is how cohesive the members are. They simply wouldn't be the same band if anyone was replaced. This time around, that couldn't be clearer, as every member plays an absolutely vital role and is the perfect compliment to the other three guys on the disc. All We Love We Leave Behind is one of those rare gems that practically never comes along. It's heavy, emotionally powerful, brilliantly composed, and never once falls short of perfection. My standards and expectations were unbelievably high, and here I am, completely blown away. Converge have done it again. Expect this one to replace Jane Doe as the fan favorite.
B008NR91DO|5.0|If you're into great rock guitar work then it's highly likely that you're also into the work of Jimi Hendrix and Gary Moore.  I know they've both been a part of my regular listening for many years now.  Imagine my very pleasant surprise when I received a review copies of Gary Moore Blues for Jimi concert CD and DVD just released by Eagle Rock Entertainment.<br /><br />This release captures a unique concert featuring Moore playing Jimi Hendrix tracks, including such classics as Purple Haze, Foxy Lady, The Wind Cries Mary, Hey Joe, Voodoo Child (Slight Return) and many more. Filmed at the London Hippodrome on October 25, 2007, it was part of the launch for the Jimi Hendrix Live At Monterey program.<br /><br />At the end of the night, Gary was joined by Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox of the Jimi Hendrix Experience for three tracks. The full line-up for this show was Gary Moore (guitar, vocals); Dave Bronze (bass); Darrin Mooney (drums) with Billy Cox (bass on Red House, Stone Free, and Hey Joe, as well as vocals on House  and Stone) and Mitch Mitchell on drums on the same tunes.<br /><br />Both Gary Moore and Mitch Mitchell have passed away since this concert took place, which makes the recording of this incredible night so special. Gary Moore was one of the finest British guitarists of all time and is one of the few players who could pay homage to Jimi Hendrix's groundbreaking and truly distinctive guitar style. This is a stunning tribute from one master guitarist to another.<br /><br />While one can never choose a favorite Hendrix tune, Boomerocity would like to highlight three randomly chosen performances from this CD/DVD concert.<br /><br />First, is Moore's faithful treatment of The Wind Cries Mary. Played and sung as only Moore could, this has got to be on a very short list of covers of the tune that Hendrix would have no doubt approved of.<br /><br />Angel is another beautifully executed cover -especially the incredible solo lead-in to the song.<br /><br />The third randomly chosen favorite is Red House with Moore's signature blues licks and smokin' white hot solo in the middle is worth the money of the CD and DVD to listen to repeatedly.  Billy Cox's bass and vocals added a different vibe and flavor as compared to Hendrix's version but it stands incredibly well on its own.<br /><br />Gary Moore: Blues For Jimi is more than well worth the price of both the CD and DVD to have in your listening and viewing library.

0525952926|5.0|I really wasn't thrilled with the first book in the series, but decided to read this one anyway.  I'm glad I did.  While some of the folks are somewhat boring, such as the Brits, other aspects of the book are fascinating and should be required reading for today's students.<br />With a growing support of Socialism occuring in this country today, people have forgotten how horrible life in Socialist countries really was.  In one scene, a Russian couple look at a Sears Roebuck catalog and are astounded by the things available to average people in the capitalist West.  The wife of a Russian agent is imprisoned in order to make sure he returns from a mission to America.<br />The most poignant scenes were from the family in Nazi Germany.  As Social Democrats, they were persecuted under the Nazi regime.  They were the voice of reason in a time of insanity.  A great example was a businessman who voted the Nazis into power because he thought the change would be good for business.  After surviving the Nazi regime and after the Communist occupation, he was out there in a mob screaming for the Communists to totally take over and solve the country's problems.  It was like supporting \\"Change\\" without asking what change actually means.  As I say, this is a very relevant book.
B003H4RDZQ|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books, despite the fact that it is a seasonal book. The way David Sedaris observes the world is no doubt a bit dark, but utterly hysterical. If you are not looking forward to the holidays, or even if you love the holidays but have a somewhat dark sense of humor, this book will leave you in tears from laughing so hard.

B00846REIS|4.0|Even though this novel seems to be a direct take on 50 Shades of Grey, I still liked it. Since I'm a fan of characterization and the relationships among characters, I would say this novel fulfills that interest very well. in many ways, I like it better than 50 Shades of Grey because I like the psychology behind the characters in this novel even more than that in 50 shades - which I also liked very much. I actually didn't expect to like this book or 50 Shades and was pleasantly surprised by them.

Watching and reading stories in the news this morning about thieves stealing farmer's electrical wire to their pumps while look-outs sit in cars with cell phones -- probably donated to them by the government -- and comparing them to these men, it seems like we live on two different planets.  May God bless these fine men and women as well as all of the supporting staff and families that give them the ability to bring justice to those who would destroy us.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|Kiss has been at it for nearly 40 years and even after that amount of time, the guys have again delivered a kick-butt album that builds off their last effort, 2009's Sonic Boom.<br /><br />I was really taken aback when I first heard this album in its entirety. There are catchy riffs, stellar drumming (and singing) by Eric Singer, some scorching solos from Tommy Thayer, a snarly, beefy bass sound from Gene Simmons and just a good all-around effort from Paul Stanley, also the album's producer.<br /><br />Sure, Stanley's voice is a tad weathered on this album, but it's a cool, true sound and nothing that's been soaked in auto tune.<br /><br />The band is much more tighter and the sound is more direct and in your face when compared to Sonic Boom. It also features some influences from Kiss' music heros - Led Zeppelin, Stones, Humble Pie, etc.<br /><br />This album is very much worth picking up.

B0090X4GJE|5.0|The main thing to remember about this new album is that it is not Lights. It's a totally new album. One cannot expect the same thing when the artist has grown and matured, and why would they write the same album over again? The overall tone of Halcyon is much more moody and sad. But I also feel like this is much more personal than Lights. Sure, Ellie wrote all of the songs on Lights mostly from personal experience. But none of them got into the raw emotion and personal feelings that Halcyon does. I feel like this has its own identity, just like Lights did. I don't compare the two. I love them both. My favorite tracks are Only You, My Blood (the lyrics are SO incredibly deep and personal), I Need Your Love, Ritual (deluxe track) and Dead in the Water.
B00846REIS|5.0|this is one hot and steamy book can relate ! i rate it 5 stars. exceptionally entertaining and splendidly sexy.\\" cant wait for the end!!! purchase at amazon
0765315246|5.0|This book gets talked about a lot. Partly it's that it had an unusual road to print, starting off as a free posting on the web. Part of it is also that the author, John Scalzi, is a well-known and prolific blogger. He's also the current president of SFWA. But there were also plenty of folks raving about just how amazing the book is.<br /><br />In short, it's been put up on the pedestal alongside the sliced bread of SF. It had a lot to live up to. So I find myself in an odd position. I really did enjoy it. It was a fun story, and I would recommend it to friends. But it simply wasn't the amazing genre-changer some folks had made it out to be.<br /><br />So, the hype wasn't really fair to it. It was good, just not that good.<br /><br />Now, with that opening compliment twisted into an insult, let me repeat that it was a good book. I really enjoyed it. It was one of those books that I found myself saying to my wife, \\"I'm really enjoying this book.\\" I suppose that's the very literal definition of a remarkably good book.<br /><br />Now, if you haven't heard anything about it, it's the story of an old man who goes off to war. Normally, you'd think that 75-year-old's are a bad fit for infantry, especially when going up against some of the most vicious monsters you can imagine. But in this particular case, these geezers are a perfect fit. How can that be? Well, the answer to that question is just one of the things that made this such a good book.<br /><br />So check it out.<br /><br />Just don't buy into the hype.
B0088TG252|5.0|This Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet arrived promptly and in excellent condition. It was exactly as advertised and met with my complete satisfaction.  I would recommend this purchase most highly to other consumers.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I love this album.  I bought it because Bergman was part of Two Steps from Hell, the group that did Invincible, and I was not disappointed.  The music is EPIC, keeps me moving, and sounds like a compilation of the best soundtracks in the last decade.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Time just melts away while I silve puzzle after puzzle.  From easy to extremely hard, this game is simple, yet complex.  I hope I can get more levels since I have almost exhausted the 600+ levels included.  Even my 6 yo grandsoon loves to play.  Really keeps the mind sharp.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I confess I went in with low expectations. I'd seen lots of people raving about it but with very little detail. About all I knew was \\"teenage gladiatorial combat\\", and that didn't really thrill me. I thought perhaps this was some odd dystopian tale of the perfect society that every now and then tossed some of its children into the meat grinder for fun, perhaps a bit like The Lottery but more cruel.<br /><br />Well, yes and no. I'll put in a mini-spoiler here that is revealed quite early in the book, and that's the fact that this is far from a perfect society, and the tossing of kids into the ring is an intentional act of cruelty by an oppressing victor over its vanquished foes. Once that became clear, these games took on an entirely different feel to me.<br /><br />And then... Wow!<br /><br />The protagonist is imperfect but very likeable, responsible but frail, and angry while still compassionate. Yeah, lots of contradictions wrapped up in one amazing character. I found her very compelling.<br /><br />And the story kept me guessing. One of the drawbacks to writing stories is that you get a good understanding of how stories work, how they flow, the build and release of tension and all that literary crap. It also means that I don't get surprised all that often anymore. And while our protagonist's dilemma is presented fairly early, my guess of the resolution kept changing the further I got in. Oh, betrayal! No, it's going to be sacrificial! No, wait, it's something else! Where is Spartacus??<br /><br />So, I say definitely check it out. It's got action, tragedy, ingenuity, more tragedy, and some bittersweet victory. The real villains, of course, are those who run the games, and with two books to go in the Hunger Games trilogy, I have some hope that those villains will get fitted for a nice spit.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|I have owned every box set by this band and was lucky enough to find a totally unplayed set on Craigslist for $40.00! Wow,can you say great sound and fantastic remastering? The sound just jumps out at you and the music is not overcompressed. I have heard some recent offerings by other bands of this era that were overcompressed to death-this in not the case here. My favorites, believe it or not, are all the early albums, especially Obscured by Clouds and Ummagumma. You will hear bass that will shock your woofers, you may need to turn it down in your car if you have a decent system.<br /><br />The biggest difference is in the guitar tones of David Gilmour and the bass of Roger Waters and/or David Gilmour.<br /><br />Ten stars all the way!
B000FBJG04|5.0|This is the book that HBO based their \\"Band of Brothers\\" mini-series on, and it was excellent. I had already seen the mini-series, which was also excellent, so I was in a position similar to times when you see the movie and then go read the book.<br /><br />If you never saw it or have no idea what I'm talking about, this is the story of the men of Easy company, a group of 150 soldiers from the 101st Airborne division in World War II. It follows them from their training in the US through D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge and their defense of Bastogne, on into Germany, and their victory lap at Hitler's very own Eagle's Nest. For the most part, they were not career military men. They were merely citizens who went off to war.<br /><br />As an aside, books get turned into movies all the time, and if you read the book first, you then decry how much they cut to squeeze it all into the 2-hour movie. If you see the movie first, the book is then filled with all this extra stuff like backstory, extra plot-lines, and character depth. But a book and a mini-series are a good fit.<br /><br />HBO gave it ten hour-long episodes and managed to cover most of the book, so while I wasn't coming across tons and tons of new material, there were still plenty of newfound gems. More than anything, it was like reading the director's commentary of the DVD, except of course, it wasn't the director. In many cases, it was direct quotes from many of the soldiers who had fought through the war. It also had a bit of surreal sense in that I felt like I already knew these people and had clear pictures of them in my mind. All in all, seeing the series before-hand made reading the book that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />One section that was in the book that the mini-series only glossed over was what these remarkable soldiers did with their lives after the war. A large number of them went into teaching, and another big bunch of them went into construction. That was a nice turn, seeing them go from a worldof destruction and violence to a life of building the future.<br /><br />I'm going to quote one little bit from those later years that really made an impression on me. Private Ralph Stafford wrote, \\"In 1950, I went bird hunting with some guys from the fire department. I shot a bird and was remorseful as I looked down at it. The bird had done me no harm and couldn't have. I went to the truck and stayed until the others returned, never to hunt again.\\" He had had enough of killing.<br /><br />It looks like a number of these soldiers went on to write and publish their own memoirs of the war, but this is the place to start.<br /><br />My only negative comment about the book was that the Kindle edition (which is what I read) was a terrible e-book conversion. There were some glitches that looked like lost words, bad text conversions like 2nd to 2d, and the index was a worthless list of topics not linked back to any location in the book. Bad Publisher - No Donut! So if you want to read this, get it in a dead-tree edition.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I've not been this hooked on an app since Plants vs. Zombies.  The game is unbelievably simple, but a great deal of fun.  Objectives keep the game fresh, even after the first 15 levels are beat.  Once you beat the first 15 levels, the game then gives you a medal for beating the game, starts over with new objectives while you keep your coins and other bought items.  So you always have the opportunity to save for that desired jetpack or gadget.  The objectives give the player something to work toward and keep the game highly playable long after the game has been beaten.<br /><br />Really, I cannot believe this game is free, I would've gladly paid for it.  It has provided hours of entertainment and I'll definitely get many hours more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Since there are so many 5-star reviews already, I'll keep this simple:<br /><br />I actually can't remember who told me about Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1-5), but I'm grateful to this forgotten person because Wool and its protagonists are unforgettable.<br /><br />Wool is easily the best of all the Kindle Daily Deals that I've purchased, and Hugh Howey is a better writer than the majority of the previously-unknown-by-me authors (and even many of the well-known authors) that I've read, and I read over 150 books a year. Wool Omnibus is in my top 10 for this year.<br /><br />Now stop reading this review and start reading Wool.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a must read for those with interest in the military, Special Forces and current events. It's written quite well, so you can visualize what the men and women involved in this event had to face before, during and after.  Not without contraversey, the author has taken great pains to tell almost everything involved while still protecting certain topics.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A book that I truly enjoyed, I have no words expect that you really should read it. Great book indeed
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The Maze Runner, the Scorch Trials and the Death Cure are fanominal books! I just loved the plot, it was great how you have no idea what will happen next. Also you should rea The Kill Order after you read the trilogy. Words cannot describe how awesome these books are!!

B002BE7JE8|5.0|I am back with my horror movie reviews for October & right now I'm going to look at The Childs Play franchise. Starting off with the 1st movie what can be said that hasn't already been said about Childs Play. Made on a budget of $9 million made $44 million. Directed by Tom Holland he directed Fright Night the original not that God awful remake. As well he directed Thinner. The original script was called Blood Buddies as well as Batteries Not Included. The idea they had in mind is that if you play too rough with the doll it would bleed. The boy was suppose to cut his hand & become a blood brother. The mother was going to be behind marketing the doll. I'm glad that it was changed to what we got normal likeable characters. Movie stars Chris Sarandon as Detective Mike Norris, Catherine Hicks as Karen Barclay, Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay & Brad Dourif as Charles Lee Ray. They story is The Cops in Chicago are after a serial killer Charles Lee Ray The Lakeshore Strangler. 1 night you have Detective Mike Norris chasing Charles Lee Ray in an alley where he manages to shoot him. His accomplic in the van drives away. Then he goes into a toy store Detective Norris manages to shoot him in the chest & the dying Charles Lee Ray swears revenge. He comes across a Good Guy Doll. He uses voodoo & transfers his soul to the doll. Then the next morning you're introduced to Andy Barclay it is his Birth Day & he really wants a Good Guy Doll. His Mom can't afford it. At the department store where she works there is this peddler outside who is selling 1 of the dolls. The dolls is the same 1 that Charles Lee Ray transfered his soul to. Karen has to work overtime her friend Maggie tells her that she will take care of Andy that night Maggie is trying to get Andy to bed. Andy tells Andy that Chucky the doll wants to watch the news. While Andy is in bed the doll starts messing around & while Maggie is cleaning a mess up on the floor Chucky takes a hammer hits her in the head & she falls out thewindow to her death. So Karen comes home the cops are investigating Andy tells his Mom that it was Chucky. He tells her that Chucky said \\"That Aunt Maggie was a real b  i  t  c h & got what she deserved!\\" The next day Chucky has Andy take him to this house where his accomplic that drove away is hiding at. Chucky sets a trap turns the gas on the stove you have that evil Brad Dourif laugh that guy grabs his gun he fires his gun where he shot the stove & the house explodes. Karen is called to The Police Department Andy keeps telling that Chucky killed that accomplic. Andy is put in the hospital. Karen takes the dolls home where she looks over the box the batteries fall out. She starts up the fire place threatens to throw him in. Chucky bites her arm she tosses the doll across the room. She tells Detective Norris that the doll is alive he doesn't believe her. She goes to the bad part of town to find that peddler he tries to assualt her. Detective Norris followed her & saves her he tells them where he got the doll at. Which causes Detective Norris to pull a file on Charles Lee Ray. In his car Chucky is waiting & he tries to strangle Detective Norris he takes the car lighter & burns Chucky. Chucky takes a knife tries to stab Norris through the seats he keeps dodging the knife the car flips over. Chucky stars runnig around messing with Norris. Detective Norris manages to get a shot in on Chucky. The next day Chucky goes to the man who taught him The Voodoo he is told that he is becoming human & that he will be trapped in the doll. He refuses to tell him how to transfer his soul out of the doll cause abused that power. Chucky takes a doll of that guy & breaks that man's arms & legs. He tells Chucky that you can only transfer your soul  to the person you 1st told who you really are. Chucky goes to the hospital that Andy is at. Detective Norris & Karen find out about this Voodoo Teacher of course their too late & near death the man tells them to save the boy. Chucky is goingafter Andy & is chased into a room this Doctor tries to calm Andy down tries to give him a shot Chucky stabs him in the back of the leg puts this elector shock head gear thing on The Doctor where he is shocked to death which is a pretty violent kill. My favorite of the movie & 1 of the best in the franchise. Chucky runs back home  barracdes the place Chucky sneaks in through the fire place takes a baseball bat knocks Andy out. He is going to do the soul transfer Detective Norris & Karen save Andy Norris is stabbed in the back of the leg he gives Karne a spare gun he has. You have somke well done scenes where Karen battles Chucky & she throws him in the fire place she yells for Andy to toss the match in Chcuky says hey I thought we were friends to the end. Andy responds by saying \\"This is the end my friend!\\" They think it's the end of Chucky. When Andy is getting the 1st aid kit he sees that Chucky's burnt body is gone. Chucky comes back & Karen starts shooting his arm then his leg off then she soots his head off. Detective Norris Partner comes in & he wonders  what's went on he is told not touch anything. He starts messing with the head of the doll where what's left of Chucky tries to choke him he throws the doll to the ground Karne takes a clear shot for the chest. They know that nobody will believe them then you have that final shot of Andy looking at what is left of Chucky & that great score by Joe Renzetti. I hope that I did a good enough job explaining the plot in this retrospective. Childs Play you have likeable characters an idea done right humor handled well it doesn't become silly like the later sequels. The effects by Kevin Yahger are great. I'd say the only problem was the part with the voodoo dolls if he had 1 for that guy why doesn't he just make some for Andy & Karen & get it over with. Tom Holland did a great job directing. Chris Sarandon did a really good job. Catherine Hicks was good. Alex Vincent did a very good job. Brad Dourif was great. The BluRay looks fined it's not a huge set up from the DVD but it looks beautiful. It still has all the features. Anyway I'll continue with Childs Play 2.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher story! Characters and locations are all very real. The suspense causes you to to just keep reading.
B008MEM24S|5.0|way better than where's my water. hilarious and entertaining. very easy to do and fun! :) you should buy it!
B0058YPL66|5.0|Purchased the D.V.D., Once Upon A Time for my mom and she loves it. She loves the show on television and she is now glad she has the first series and can watch it as many times as she want to. Product was shipped on time and received it perfect condition. Thanks Again. My mom enjoyed this so much, she can't wait until more series are released to this set.Will definitely order again through Amazon.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Its a good game but if you are looking for something similar to the second installment, there will be disappointment waiting.  The puzzle games seems to be forced on you, and with a forced time limit, there seems to be more of a rush to get through the levels.  Its ok, but I do like the second one better.
1423165691|5.0|Like other reviewers, I've had this book on pre-order for several years and it arrived today - it was worth the wait.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book. The drawing are gorgeous and printed on heavy matte paper.  Drawings come from Disney's hand drawn features (ranging from \\"Snow White\\" to \\"Princess and the Frog\\") with drawings from a few of the shorts mixed in.  The drawings are presented in chronological order.<br /><br />The format is different from the Archive Series but complements it well.  I don't have my Archive Series books handy so I can't see if there are duplicates, but if you like the Archive Series, you'll like this book.  The book actually feels like the Sketchbook series of books that are out of print and hard to find.<br /><br />My only complaint is that most of the drawings are unattributed.  The only flaw in an otherwise perfect book.<br /><br />I hope to see more in this series.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is an awesome series... I love it! Its exciting, and will leave you wanting more. I look forward to the third season. This is absolutely an amazingly thought out series
1119962846|5.0|I had not done any programming for at least 15 years.  I had a project that needed programming.  The R language was recommended to me.  I had no experience with R so I bought this book.  I found it an excellent way to learn the basics and the nuances of R.  I recommend it highly.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|While the sex in this trilogy feeds the appetite, I found that this one lost the story line and became just sex and it a bit boring.  Plus, the use of the \\"F\\" word was way over used in this third novel.  It is an ugly and angry word that really needs to be eliminated from daily vocabulary and really spoiled the read for me.
B008CIUS72|1.0|Did not work as expected at all...<br />Did not live up to expectations.  Too confusing to run, too difficult to open
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This is the best concert that Adele has given to the public, because it meant so much to her to do. She gives it her all, even though it was close to the time she lost her voice. She does the incredible and takes her audience the top and gives them her best!!!
B004KKX80A|4.0|Kids these days. My 5 year old loves the show, and we told him if he was good in school for 2 weeks we'd order him one. He chose Pegasus, apparently the show's protagonist, and he loved getting the package from UPS.<br /><br />Product: Its a sturdy top that feels like steel. It definitely seems like it could take a beating. My only gripe would be that the instructions are largely in Japanese, so you'll have to figure out how to put it together, and it was a really tight fit.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My whole family plays this game. It is fun but the dictionary is limited. I have the paid version on my phone and it is still limited. I like it though
B008COD5OO|4.0|For those who've written bad reviews stating this film had no redeeming value or in no way left you feeling educated or as if you had learned something...well, you're absolutely right; however, there is one problem with that notion...IT WASN'T MEANT TO!  The trailers and advertisements for this film stated it was about a high school party that turned epic, then got out of control.  This movie delivered on every level what it promised.  I didn't walk away feeling I had learned how to cope with life better or osmotically learned a new level of responsibility.  Instead, I remembered (and felt!) exactly what it was like oh-so-many years ago in high school...especially senior year.<br /><br />This movie was an extended metaphor of my life senior year.  I WAS the main character.  I could not believe the similarities!  I, too, was an invisible kid until that Friday night when a few of my friends made me throw a party after my parents had gone out of town for the weekend.  I, too, wanted only 10 or 15 people.  I didn't end up with 1500, but I think about 60-70 seems about right.  In a respected neighborhood with nose-over-the-fences neighbors, I had people puking in the front and back yards.  Christmas ornaments and cups of Screwdrivers being sucked up by a nozzled-vacuum cleaner.  Potted plants being thrown inside my house.  My dog was stoned and ate half the dish of peanut butter balls we had given up on.  PJ cups strewn all over the place (as well as people - and clothes - for that matter).  Strip Pool, strip poker, Beer Pong, Naked Jell-O Twister (I copy-writed that...don't steal it Mattel or whomever), and Insane Rules Mortal Kombat.  I also hooked up with a girl I previously had been too shy and worthless to try for.  I was even run over by a car (somehow was not injured)!<br /><br />But God it was seemingly the greatest (or most fun) night of my life back then.  I had people coming up to me I didn't know and had never seen saying how great a time they had, and peopleshouting \\"Killer party dude!\\"  Luckily, though, I had a couple days to clean and some true friends to help me do so and somehow we pulled it off masterfully.  But the point is this:  this film allowed me to go back and recapture all of that.  It helped me forget about my present obstacles for the time being.  I don't feel there is anything wrong with that when, of course, taken into perspective.  If anyone were to say, \\"Well this movie's going to make teenage Johnny go and try to throw the same party...\\" wrong...he was already planning it.  In fact, this may have helped him avoid a few mistakes, broken laws, and injuries, even.  So maybe it did have some \\"redeeming value.\\"  But if not, it had qualitative value in that it took spending only a few bucks and giving up an hour or so of my time to let me feel that night again...and I thank this movie very much for that!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son is 9 years old, he loves this thing. He would use it all day if he were allowed. He builds and explores all kinds of stuff. Great for the imagination
B008NW67E0|1.0|I loved their first CD, every song.  I was so anxious for their new one, but after listening to it several times, I didn't like any of their songs.  I loved the first, very disappointed in the second CD.
1587613379|2.0|What a waste of time.<br />Amateurs.<br />Most of the content is focused on dealing with the drama/aftermath of a polyamorous lifestyle (, complete with elementary-school exercises that barely paint a veneer of security over the depths of a psychology neither of the authors, clearly, understand).<br />If you're having to deal with that much drama, it's blatantly evident, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.<br />But it doesn't surprise me that this book is a lousy beginners' guide to something that requires a certain prerequisite expertise... I mean, how objective can you possibly be, when you have no clue what it's like to master being the gender you aren't, and have no clue what kind of harmony that can lead to with the opposite gender...<br />Nope, no surprise here: It was written by two females (, with limited, and very beta, male references). And the content indicates that at least one of them is past their shelf-life.<br />(Which shouldn't be an issue..., yet it is. Go figure.)<br /><br />(The extra star is for effort, just like elementary school.)
B008J34466|1.0|I bought the Target cd which has 17 songs.  I only like 2 of the 17 songs. I won't be buying anymore cd's by Pink.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The video quality and sound was excellent! This movie was awesome, I recommed that you watch it, it seems like this will be a series. Can't wait for the next one.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I picked this book up as a easy read for entertainment.  It was amusing for awhile but then kept going on and on following the same theme.  If you get through the middle, the end is a good read.  Overall, it was a three.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|this is NOT a great book.<br />It fails , in the action and plot.Finally it gets confusing and boring.<br />Toobad I really like most of the Reacher books.
0671027344|1.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a great book! It was short but still a great read. I bought the book for my book club and I received it when we had already moved on to are next book. I bought the book from this seller especially because of the fast shipping reviews and info on the seller. But I finally got the book almost a month after I ordered it. Overall the book was not worth it, I did not even need it since it came so late.

B008OGJXJ6|5.0|i cant remember ever hearing so much about a Dylan record before i got to hear it. is it because no one else is making records anymore? am i missing something? many people are writing that this is Dylan,s best record since (pick one): 1. Blood on the Tracks 2. Oh Mercy 3. Time Out of Mind. i,m not sure why they feel the need to go to such hypebolic lengths. that said, it,s pretty good. i especially like the first five tracks (side one?) & i,ve been playing the daylights out of Paid in Blood. do they still make singles? Paid in Blood would be a wicked single - very mid-seventies Stonesy groove & a perfect showcase for Dylan,s voice. i like the old testament growl that he uses these days - suits the material, all that blood & thunderation. i am partial to these late period Chicago-blues-band-playing-Tex-Mex-swing records. one thing that,s a little weird, my wife pointed out, Tempest sounds so much like the Christmas record Bob did that she cant help but hear it as a Christmas record too. that may be weird, but not completely off-base. The two songs that seem to attract the most attention are the Titanic song & Roll On John. they,re good enough songs, but listen to them closely. i would suggest that the Titanic song is not about the Titanic, but about the watchman's dream & that the Leo with the sketchbook is not Leo diCaprio, but Leo daVinci. just thinking out loud here. some people didnt like Dylan using fragments of Beatles songs in Roll On John, but he uses all sorts of other fragments in there, notably William Blake, so you have to figure that there are wheels within wheels here. some of the other people writing about this record were lamenting the absence of guitar solos, especially with Charlie Sexton on board, but i,m hearing all sorts of tasty fills between verses & beyond that i dont see whats wrong the bluesy grooves that dominate most of these songs: it is ensemble playing & the groove aspect is what makes the longer tracks move along without getting stale.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Second in the three-part series and not quite as good as the first book,cannot wait for the third edition. Only concern is since there are so many moving parts to this trilogy the time in between the book releases requires a very good memory. Overall it is up there with some of the Herman wouk classics of yesteryear
B0098VYCCE|4.0|It's great being able to streamline videos from Amazon! The movie was great! I will definitely rent more movies in the future.
0307720950|3.0|I dislike this book because Anderson contradicts himself. He writes that his grandfather was the inventor of a time-controlled sprinkler, but couldn't be a millionaire because he wasn't a businessman. As far as I can see, Anderson has the same problem with writing this book; he writes from the perspective of a technology buff, not a businessman.<br /><br />Anderson goes on and on about how any idiot can use CAD software to design three-dimensional doodads and build them in seconds with a three-dimensional printer. Okay, that part is true, but who's going to buy them? He says that his daughter used Sims to redesign a dollhouse, but couldn't get the right kind of dollhouse furniture for it. So he gets the idea of using 3D software to design it, a 3D printer to print it, and then sell it. Hooray, now he's a millionaire!<br /><br />But hang on...<br /><br />Just because you can make some funky new dingus doesn't mean it'll sell. Are there that many girls in the world who want customized dollhouse furniture? Even if a million 6 year olds do in fact want it, you still have to get their parents to spend the cash! On the other hand, if you own a successful toy store, then this could work. You already have customers coming in, so you can add something to what you already sell. This is a great plan for an established business, but not for a startup.<br /><br />Chinese factories can make plastic toys by the vollume of 100 per minute, much more than a 3D printer! Worse, a good 3D printer isn't cheap; it'll cost you $40,000, and you'll be competing with a $1,000,000 machine. The industrial plastic-injector can churn out a better quality product much quicker than a 3D printer, and cheaper too.<br /><br />Architecture firms are using 3D printers to make models; it saves them time and eliminates the fee to the model maker. I know of jewelry companies that use computer-controlled laser cutters to cut shapes out of plastic, metal, and wood, for custom jobs. But these are companies that already have the customers; they just use the machines to build on what they have. In THE LEAN STARTUP, the author writes that the most successful companies had the customers long before the product was even made. Now how does that compare to someone with million dollar machines, a store full of products, and nobody to buy them?<br /><br />I wager he wouldn't last long.
B004KKX814|3.0|Usually these things go for $6 or less at ToysrUs, and with shipping and handling this tiny toy can get pretty expensive.  I purchesed three from this company and with delivery fees I ended up paying over $70.  I could have bought a couple of nice bayblade battle games with a few beyblades for that amount.  Now that I look back I am realizing that Amazon isn't the best place to shop or at least some of the vendors.  I just hope that this thing is as good as the reviews I have read or I will seriously doubt my online purchaing abilities.<br /><br />Update, my grandson loves the green one (I bought three).  It is his new favorite as he collects them.  These are quite hard to assemble (they do not come already together).  The instructions are legible at best.  I had to go on youtube to see how they were put together.  They are a little more sturdier than the others he has but still not worth the money.  Plus the packaging is in Chinese so I did not know which one was which.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I rented it on Zune marketplace because i happen to have a microsoft Xbox 360 and they stream full 1080 vids with no interruptions (way better than any other streaming method). I'm a fan of Idris Elba from alot of british shows and Charlize Theron is almost always good in her roles. I don't see alot of mesmerizing performances in sci-fi movies simply because too much is usually going on story-wise to get deep into characters. That is true in this film unfortunately, i say that not because the characters weren't explored early on and introduced through story (they were) but since i didn't feel emotionally attached to them like in some of the more memorable films i've seen. It's very hard to create that sense of feeling for a character in a few hours as opposed to tv where when an actor dies it's enveloping after watching for an entire season(walking dead, sons of anarchy, etc.) Overall, i was entertained and would say that this movie is to this franchise (alien) what terminator salvation was to it's franchise, just another installment. I've rarely seen preqeuls or sequels that are better than the original and this lives up to that stereotyping. I have to admit my #1 reason for renting was i crave sci-fi films which are few and far between unless you like the cheesy network b-movie variety and #2 was I'm a fan of Charlize Theron. This movie didn't dissapoint on either of my two reasons (good overall entertainment/charlize was steady), but the overall experience feels like it's been done before.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I really wanted to like this book.  Unfortunately, the characters were all one-dimensional and flat.  The lack of character development led to a lack of plot interest.  Characters are resident in the book, serving very little purpose, until they perform the one act they are there to initiate to move the plot forward.  Unfortunately, the plot is obvious.  The only tension is will they or won't they get together. Subplots are boring to non-existent, the competition a big let-down, and the romance reeks of Harlequin.  There are questions that remain unanswered at the end of the book--If the book were better written, I might have found this disturbing.  But, as it is, I didn't really care.  The book never engaged my imagination.<br /><br />Why did I give it three stars?  The author is adept at describing setting.  Her descriptions of the circus colors, smells, tent gimmicks, costuming, etc. are captivating, warranting this an average read.

It wasn't just about Osama either. It told about the journey to become the kind of soldier it takes to be part of such an elite force. I am grateful to the author and hope only the best in life for him and others like him. He (and his teammates) put their life on the line for freedom. The cost is extremely high.

B002FGU3X6|5.0|This is the rare sandal that runs true to size.  I wear a size 7 1/2 4E shoe, and sandals are virtually impossible to find. Those that are wide enough are too long, and those that are the appropriate length aren't wide enough. Birkenstocks fit, too, but they are delicate and cannot be gotten wet. These sandals are perfect.  They fit, and are extremely durable and comfortable as well.  There is not much arch support, so they are not really suitable for long hikes, but they are fine for weekend use in the city and suburbs and at the beach.  The quality and durability is really first rate, Tevas are always reliable.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Is awesomer a word?  Its not I know, but I LOVED this entire trilogy!  Everyone knows about the descriptive, squirm in your seat, erotica, but what surprised me was the burgeoning love story between Christian and Ana.  I hated him in the beginning for his degradation and total debasement of women, but by the end of the book, I was totally sympathetic and by the end of Book Three, he was my hero!  I couldn't put it down and finished reading the whole trilogy in five days!  You may as well order the trilogy upfront because you wont be able to stop reading after the first one.  I can't wait for the movie!

And I dare you to find one place in the film where anyone says \\"Play it again, Sam.\\"!  Seriously, this is a great film and they just don't make them like this anymore. Get this one into your library of classics. You won't regret it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have the highest respect for Cut the Rope. It doesn't sell out like Angry Birds and Om Nom is soooo adorable. It's my favorite mainstream app.
B000I3PERS|5.0|This is a great movie with Mel Gibson. Regardless of what you think of him as a person (some people find him quirky or thoroughly dislike him) you have to admit he is a great actor. This film deals with the Scottish rebellion of the Highlanders against the tyranny of the English. When you watch this you will understand why the Scots still have a huge disliking of the English. The ending will make you cry and possibly get angry. It's OK, I did the same. Very epic in the filming with grand scenes of battle. But also shows the beauty of the land. Loved the costuming and it was all authentic. Kind of light on the history lesson but gives the gist of what was going on at the time. Bonnie Prince Charlie and all that kind of stuff is portrayed but not gone into in great detail. If you liked \\"The Patriot\\", you will love this one. Give it a try.

B003UESJHO|4.0|Thematically, \\"The Fighter\\" brings nothing much new. America, as the boxing-obsessed nation, has produced many films on this subject - in Hollywood or elsewhere. But \\"The Fighter\\" (2010) is delightfully less saccharine than, let's say, \\"Cinderella Man\\", and at the same time more accessible than the acclaimed \\"Raging Bull\\". Still, just as both of the two, it is an artistic expression of a true story.<br /><br />The two talented boxers - but first and foremost two brothers - are played by Oscar winner Christian Bale (in a stunning performance which speaks volumes without the character actually saying anything) and Mark Wahlberg, who cements his reputation with this flick for good. Their female counterparts are no less wonderful - Amy Adams is a joy to watch as Wahlberg's tough yet vulnerable girlfriend and the dependable Melissa Leo (\\"Frozen River\\") hands in a strikingly believable performance of a pretty unbelievable character - a mother of nine and boxing manager rolled into one.<br /><br />\\"The Fighter\\" is predominantly a film about family (although not a family film), showing much compassion and understanding to its flawed characters, also offering a glimpse into sensation-seeking work of journalists (HBO this time).<br /><br />Rent it or view it first, but most of you will probably want to own the film afterwards anyway.
0893860468|4.0|\\"I AM That\\" is a very well written but somewhat repetitive book on Sri Nisargadatta\\"s non dual philosophy.  Out of the few books that I have read concerning non-dualism, Sri Nisargadatta's explanation and description of his practice far surpass other books; however, this is still a very difficult concept to comprehend.  Probably the most perplexing idea is the contention that we are the eternal source.  Sri Nisargadatta does not differentiate between \\"God\\" as the \\"Supreme Source\\" and ourselves.  Sri Nisargadatta maintains that there is one reality and the person does not exist.  This is an extremely difficult concept for the western mind to accept.  The conundrum is explaining how we can maintain our personal identity and share the one \\"reality\\" or \\"consciousness\\" at the same time. However, as Sri Nisargadatta states, one can never understand this solely in intellectual terms and one would, indeed, have to have this \\"super conscious experience to know this reality. Although extremely difficult, I would still highly recommend this book.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Charlize Theron was the only really strong performance in this movie. Chris Hemsworth was disappointing--not believable. Stewart was not very believable, either.

0525953728|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed No Easy Day. An easy read with the right amount of detail and personal insight on what he was experiencing throughout. In my opinion a book that should have been written whether or not the authors are refuted by subsequent writings or history. I was extremely impressed by Owen's professional approach and lack of \\"SEAL bravado\\" but at the same time enjoyed his sharing the smack talk and pranks among his teammates. I really felt it is an honest telling of the life of a contemporary elite warrior who was good enough and lucky enough to participate in one of world history's biggest special operations missions. Simply put, if you maintain an interest even remotely in the subject matter, you need to read this account. I am no expert, but I did not find any instance where the authors related anything that would be classified or harmful. I feel they did an admirable job in avoiding such conflicts in their text. If nothing else it is a fine memoir of a very recent counterterrorism commando who indeed did take part in the elimination of the world's leading terrorist figure.
1401216676|1.0|I was looking for a good Batman graphic novel to read after reading most of vol. 1 of Chronicles (wanted something more recent and darker). Everywhere I heard this book was one of the best however after reading the story online and peoples interpretations it didn't seem that great. But I decided to give it a shot anyway. I found it in the book store and decided to read a bit of it before I bought it. Before I knew it I was finished and the whole depressing thing was over. Why is this one of the best Batman stories ever? I put it back and didn't spend my money on it. Yes the Art was fantastic but everything else was not very good.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />For starters the entire story is basically Gordon and his daughter get tortured to try and make them go crazy (Not really that great of a plan) the other half is a flashback of Joker which was just not very interesting. I'm sorry I've grown used to the Joker who has no origin. Even Joker in Batman #1 was more interesting. He just showed up, now we got chemicals that made him crazy? It's just not very convincing. The Joker was drawn strangely too, a few plates are awesome but he usually looks scared or surprised or like a little British boy.<br /><br />2nd where is Batman? Batman has almost nothing to do the entire story except show up at the end to save the day. And laughing at the end? I just didn't buy it. This man just crippled your old partner and friend and tortured her father and your going to laugh now? The who fact that he even let him tell a joke was out of place. I get that people are trying to say Joker and batman are like '2 sides of a coin' but in real life I don't think anyone would sympathize with someone who has just done what Joker did.<br /><br />3erd whats with all the nakedness? Weird naked midget things, Gordon's naked(guess to make him crazier) Barbra is naked (for no reason). The whole thing was just weird.<br /><br />4th it was depressing and no closure. Basically people are tortured, crippled and Batman Laughs! That's all folks. The only positive thing is Gordon doesn't go mad (which we are suppose to believe because he tells batman to catch Joker and not kill him). But would saying kill him in the state Gordon was in really make him crazy anyway? And how are we suppose to judge how he is crazy? What if he just acted mad so joker would let him go. How do you measure craziness? The long term effects of what happened are still to be seen.<br /><br />basically the whole story was filled with torture, weird bondage things and little resolve. It was just too depressing and weird for me.rippled and Batman Laughs! That's all folks.

B006L4MWVE|1.0|Battle Royale. This movie was a huge let down. The effects were not adequate. The actors were not believable and the story line was lacking in detail and substance. Great idea, however it was not portrayed well and I just didn't understand why everything had to evolve around love? It was a bit silly. Some scenes were either too exaggerated or long and dull. This movie lacked in direction. There were simply too many flaws in the plot. Example, if one was to be forced into a death game depicted in Battle Royale they would resist and try to escape. One would not automatically, without questioning, abide by the rules of the savage game and kill their friends.<br />The movie does not flow. One fraction of the students found a loophole and a way to eliminate the true enemy, however \\"coincidently\\" happened you die straight after.<br />Also I understand the director was attempting to portray the theme of \\"desperate times call for desperate measures,\\" and that even friends would turn on each other, but it was not executed well. The idea could have made this movie a masterpiece, but the soundtrack, the actors, the camera shots and effects dragged the picture down to the bottom of the ocean.
0553386697|5.0|Daniel Siegel & Tina Payne Bryson have created a wonderful resource for parents, teachers, and anyone who works with people.  I have passed this book to many preschool parents and they all have found it easy to read, digest, and use.

Adults can be much more compassionate towards children when they understand that the children are doing their best but are simply working with incomplete brains!

B005EI86JU|5.0|I stumbled upon this book on the Nikonians website, and downloaded the Kindle version.  I found Darrell Young's writing clear and concise.  He lays out the book logically and goes into detail that is understandable.  His recommendations after each section are helpful as well.  You certainly don't have to agree with every one of Darrell's recommendations, but it is good food for thought.  I have owned my D7000 for about a year and a half, and I still have to learn about all the features of this amazing camera, and Darrell definitely helps with this outstanding book.  It certainly has helped with my enjoyment of photographing with the D7000.<br /><br />As an aside, I also liked how you can jump around from chapter to chapter in the Kindle version.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Well this month, October 2012 marks the 50th anniversary of the first James Bond movie, [[ASIN:B008YKV2FU Dr. No]] which starred Sean Connery in the quintessential role of James Bond Agent 007 working for Her Majesty's Government under MI-6, which is Britain's international spy agency similar to the American CIA. This also gives the creators of the series the opportunity to release the [[ASIN:B006U1J5ZY Bond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection]] on Blu-ray. This also is the year in which the 23rd film in the James Bond series is being released starring Daniel Craig as he reprises his role as James Bond in the soon to be released Skyfall, after putting in a stunning first performance as Bond in 2007 with [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]] and then following that up with an equally impressive performance again in 2009 with [[ASIN:B0020MR8ZG Quantum of Solace]]. This third outing as James Bond is just as impressive as the first two and arguably the best of all three.<br /><br />Now there is no arguing that Sean Connery is THE Bond to which all others are compared to and there are quite a few in that list starting with; Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, George Lazenby, Pierce Brosnan, and even Sir David Niven in an earlier spoof of the Bond films in the first [[ASIN:B0055OG2BC Casino Royale]] which was released in 1967. Everyone has their favorite but it is an undeniable fact that Sean Connery set the mark and no other actor even came close to it. Well that is until Daniel Craig was selected for the role. Craig's performance in [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]] was nothing short of remarkable and firmly placed him in contention as the heir apparent to the Sean Connery/ Bond legacy. His place as the heir apparent was then solidified with his performance in [[ASIN:B0020MR8ZG Quantum of Solace]], although I must agree with several of the critics that the movie itself could have been better especially since it was cut down to a little more than 90 minutes instead of the 120 plus minutes that it should have been. However, Craig's performance as James Bond was flawless.<br /><br />Now we fast forward to 2012 and the release of the 23rd film in the Bond series with Skyfall. I was fortunate enough to attend a special showing of this film and let me tell you that after watching it the mantle has now been firmly and permanently passed from Sean Connery to Daniel Craig as THE James Bond Agent 007. Craig has in my opinion surpassed Connery as the quintessential James Bond and I don't foresee that changing anytime soon as reports are out that Craig has signed on to reprise the role an additional four more times, which by Hollywood standards should give us another ten years of wonderfully exciting Bond adventures.<br /><br />I am definitely going to be very careful on what I type in the next few paragraphs as I don't want to give away any spoilers. So with that in mind, here we go....<br /><br />James Bond (Daniel Craig) is currently on an assignment when, through a series of unfortunate events, he is believed to have been killed while in the service of MI-6. He is fact not dead, however his true fate does not immediately become known and everyone is led to believe that he has in fact died. Meanwhile, \\"M\\" who is played by Judi Dench, gets a troubling reminder about an old nemesis from her past, Raoul Silva, a truly delightful Bond villain played with complete and total believability by Javier Bardem, whom you might recall as the main character in the Coen Brother's movie, [[ASIN:B0011BE3K0 No Country for Old Men]] where he played an unstoppable psychopathic hitman. Murder and mayhem ensue as MI-6 is shaken to its very core by the vengeful minded Raoul Silva (Bardem) and his insane quest to see MI-6 and especially \\"M\\" destroyed. Just when things are looking very bleak for \\"M\\" and MI-6, Bond reappears and prepares to stand between \\"M\\" and the villainous Silva.<br /><br />This installment in the series is going to reintroduce you to a verylovable and truly missed character from the original films and that is \\"Q\\" who was played by the late Desmond Llewelyn in several of the older Bond films. The role of \\"Q\\" is now being played by Ben Whishaw, which may seem a bit of a stretch until you see the film. Whishaw does an outstanding job in his portrayal of \\"Q\\" and I am quite sure you will agree with me after seeing this film. Now one thing you won't see is any real reference to or involvement with Quantum in this film. As you may recall from the previous two films, Quantum is the shadowy organization run by many of the richest and most powerful people throughout the world.<br /><br />And of course, let us not forget the delectably delicious Bond girls, which began with the stunningly beautiful Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, and continuing in this film with Naomie Harris as Eve and Berenice Marlohe as Severin. And speaking of beautiful women, the very lovely and talented Adele sings the title song from the movie and, like all of her songs, is simply powerful and beautiful. A song that is surely destined to be a classic.<br /><br />I have now purchased my tickets in advance for the \\"official\\" midnight showing of this film on Thursday, November 8th/Friday, November 9th at Midnight to watch it a second time. And like the two previous films I will more than likely see it a few more times than that before it leaves the theaters and joins my other Bond films on Blu-ray in my personal library.<br /><br />UPDATED SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />DO NOT continue reading this review if you don't want any spoilers given to ruin your movie experience. You have been warned!<br /><br />Okay, now that the movie has been officially released here in the United States, I can go ahead and expand a bit upon my initial review. Below is a more detailed synopsis of the plot of the movie.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Bond and a fellow (as of yet unnamed female M-I6 agent) chasing down a suspected terrorist who has a stolen computer disc that contains the identities of numerous undercover agents throughout the world who are working undercover in various terrorist organizations. The action is literally non-stop throughout the entire opening sequence which has Bond in quite a wild pursuit on foot, in vehicles, and even on top of a train. Very entertaining and quite thrilling up until the moment where Bond is actually shot by his fellow (as of yet unnamed) MI-6 agent, whom you will later find out that he has a very entertaining verbal sparring match with, which if you are a true Bond fan will give you a clue to her identity, which you do find out at the very end of the film. Which brings us into the opening credits with the title song being sung by Adele. My first impression was that Maurice Binder must be absolutely thrilled with this title sequence as it brought back fond memories of the earlier Binder sequences.<br /><br />Bond is presumed dead which leaves a visually shaken M to mourn and ultimately write his obituary. Suddenly an attack happens at MI-6 with implications to an old enemy from M's past, although at the time we don't have any idea who it is or why the attack took place. Meanwhile, Bond is living his life with the new found freedom of having almost died and miraculously surviving by drinking and sleeping with a beautiful woman in a beach front location. I was particularly fond of the introduction of a scorpion in the bar scene. While recovering from the previous nights bout of drinking, Bond watches a new broadcast of the attack of MI-6 in London and decides to resurrect himself from the dead and go back to London.<br /><br />Bond returns amid controversy and suspicion and gets put back out into the field after a series of entertaining physical and psychological tests that he somehow passes. And this sets everything else up and puts it all into play for the rest of the movie. Now I am not going to give you an entire play-by-play review of the entire movie, but I will highlight a couple of interesting points I took away from the film.<br /><br />POINT ONE: The witty banter that is displayed between Bond and Silva during their initial meeting was really quite brilliant and there were quite a few funny lines delivered between the two of them.<br /><br />POINT TWO: The fight scene involving Bond and several villains in the Chinese gambling parlor was pretty good until the introduction of a very large reptile which made it GREAT!<br /><br />POINT THREE: You actually learn a bit of Bond's earlier history as a child and where he comes from.<br /><br />POINT FOUR: You get to see the return of should I say reinventing of two lovable and cherished characters from the earlier films, Q and ? (Guess Who)<br /><br />POINT FIVE: The demise of and replacement of ......<br /><br />POINT SIX: The return of the Bond gadgets. Sorely missed in the last two films and horribly done in several of the previous ones.<br /><br />POINT SEVEN: The return of a classic Bond character who or should I say \\"object\\" that most fans will remember from the third Bond film, [[ASIN:B001PO6FJ0 Goldfinger]].<br /><br />POINT EIGHT: The witty references throughout this film to many things from the originals. Here is a fun thing to do when you go see the movie for a second time, try and count how many references there are to things in the original films.<br /><br />And the rest you will just have to go and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed!

While recovering from the previous nights bout of drinking, Bond watches a new broadcast of the attack of MI-6 in London and decides to resurrect himself from the dead and go back to London.<br /><br />Bond returns amid controversy and suspicion and gets put back out into the field after a series of entertaining physical and psychological tests that he somehow passes. And this sets everything else up and puts it all into play for the rest of the movie. Now I am not going to give you an entire play-by-play review of the entire movie, but I will highlight a couple of interesting points I took away from the film.<br /><br />POINT ONE: The witty banter that is displayed between Bond and Silva during their initial meeting was really quite brilliant and there were quite a few funny lines delivered between the two of them.<br /><br />POINT TWO: The fight scene involving Bond and several villains in the Chinese gambling parlor was pretty good until the introduction of a very large reptile which made it GREAT!<br /><br />POINT THREE: You actually learn a bit of Bond's earlier history as a child and where he comes from.<br /><br />POINT FOUR: You get to see the return of should I say reinventing of two lovable and cherished characters from the earlier films, Q and ? (Guess Who)<br /><br />POINT FIVE: The demise of and replacement of ......<br /><br />POINT SIX: The return of the Bond gadgets. Sorely missed in the last two films and horribly done in several of the previous ones.<br /><br />POINT SEVEN: The return of a classic Bond character who or should I say \\"object\\" that most fans will remember from the third Bond film, [[ASIN:B001PO6FJ0 Goldfinger]].<br /><br />POINT EIGHT: The witty references throughout this film to many things from the originals. Here is a fun thing to do when you go see the movie for a second time, try and count how many references there are to things in the original films.<br /><br />And the rest you will just have to go and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed! I haven't been and I have seen it three times now.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

In hindsight some of the decisions made by the characters in the movie really don't make much sense. A few of those decisions are extremely stupid. Yeah, petting the thing that looks like a pissed off snake is probably a bad idea. There are some pretty hilarious reviews out there pointing out all the dumb decisions that were made throughout the movie.<br /><br />Where I disagree with some of the other reviews is regarding David and the crew. I saw David as a emotionless robot that was given a specific agenda by his \\"creator\\". Sometimes he seemed almost evil, but he was making decisions like a computer would and not based on actual emotional connections. As for the crew, the movie takes place more than 75 years in the future, but we are watching it and seeing it through the eyes of the world we live in today. The movie doesn't at all discuss the state of the planet, its technology, or space exploration, but quite a bit can be inferred from what we do see. Space travel is most likely very normal with jobs in space being common so who makes up the crew didn't really seem strange to me, especially considering it was a private company paying for the mission and not the government.<br /><br />The cast did a good job, though I was disappointed to see Charlize Theron so under-utilized when she is capable of so much more.

0345803485|1.0|I'd been hearing from so many women who were enthralled with this book - and seeing it on all the best-seller lists - that I thought I'd try it, especially because the E-book was available at a pretty good discount.  I even met some women who've read all 3 of the books (one has read them twice) and say they were addicting.<br /><br />But the idea of a book I can't put down didn't match reality.  This is a book I could easily put down, and if I hadn't paid for it I wouldn't have bothered to even finish it.  And speaking of finishing it - it just ends, no startling finish or anything, it just ends on page 391.  All that reading and......no surprise ending.<br /><br />I gave this 1 star because it's easy to read and moves quickly, but it's a book without a real plot, just a lot of repetitive 'experiences.'  I really would like to give this a negative rating, though.<br /><br />If you want to read this, get it from the library, or at a library book sale.  But if you like books with plots, get something else.

034552554X|5.0|I read The Language of Flowers in just a few days - I couldn't put it down. I learned so much about communicating with flowers, and about what it could mean for someone to grow up without being loved, and yet learn to love eventually. I have had some experience with a teenager in the foster system, and Victoria rang true for me. I wanted to reach out and hug her, and assure her that if she just trusted, everything would be better. Towards the end of the book, I had tears streaming down my face, and found myself praying for and rooting for Victoria. My book club is reading the book now, and I look forward to the discussion. My thanks goes to Vanessa Diffenbaugh for taking the time to reach into her soul and write this book. It will always be a favorite to recommend.

Initially, I was shocked at the cavalier way in which Steve Jobs treated people and thought that he was narcissistic, ambitious to the point of callousness and  emotionally immature. However, persevering with the narrative I found a grudging respect for his single mindedness and perfectionism. He has made a huge difference in technological advancement this century. The story of Steve Jobs is  well written, the author has pulled no punches and without putting a glossy spin on the character, has succeeded in writing a gripping biography about a man who has  left an indelible footprint.

Good thing she didnt have to do much, because she's really not much of an actress.

0670022950|5.0|One of these days I'm going to sit down and make a list of the Top 100 nonfiction books that everyone absolutely must read if they really want to understand the world we live in.  And, when I do, this book by the noted experimental psychologist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker will definitely make the Top Ten.  In fact, I'm even tempted to say that this might very well be the most important book of the 21st century thus far.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit that I might be just a little bit biased in this assessment, because this book deals, in large part, with my two main areas of study as a political scientist: international relations, with a focus on war and international security, and comparative politics, with a focus on political development and modernization.  In fact, this book bridges these two topics by showing how modernization has helped make the world more peaceful.  (And if you don't believe that the world is a lot more peaceful today than it was at any time in the past, you really do need to read this book.)  When I was in grad school (where I studied under John A. Vasquez and James Lee Ray, two of the world's leading experts on war and peace, both of whom are cited in Pinker's book) my main focus was on the scientific study of international militarized conflict, using quantitative methods such as statistical analysis and game theory in order to better understand why nations go to war and what it takes to maintain the peace.  This particular subfield of international relations (which is sometimes referred to as \\"peace science\\") aims to identify historical patterns and trends in international conflict, to find variables that correlate well with war (or with peace), to assess the probability that an international crisis will escalate to the use of military force, and to evaluate foreign policy alternatives to see which are more likely to provoke war and which are more likely to promote peace.  Although peace science is usually viewed as a subfield of international relations (which is itself a subfield of political science), it is really an interdisciplinary field that draws on a number of different academic disciplines, from political science, to sociology, to psychology, to econometrics, to mathematics, to systems engineering and beyond (in fact, the generally recognized \\"founder\\" of the field, Lewis Fry Richardson, was a physicist, mathematician, meteorologist, and psychologist).  And peace scientists no longer limit themselves to studying international conflict alone, but are now applying their methods to the study of civil wars, ethnic conflict, terrorism, and other forms of politically-motivated or \\"group-on-group\\" violence.  Over the past few decades, peace science has discovered a number of things about what leads to war and what keeps the peace.  Unfortunately, the general public is largely unaware of these discoveries because they haven't been well publicized -- at least not until now.  In this book, Steven Pinker tries to bring some of the key findings of peace science research to the public's attention.<br /><br />Although a number of excellent scholarly works have been written by researchers in the field of peace science, most of these are aimed specifically at an academic audience that is accustomed to reading and interpreting quantitative research.  These texts tend to be highly technical and rather dry; and most of them presume that the reader already has a strong background in the fundamentals of the subject.  So they are unlikely to be of much interest to lay readers.  And even the few books on the subject that are written so as to be reasonably accessible to non-specialists still tend to be written in the academic style of the scholar, rather than the more relaxed style of the popular writer; so they're unlikely to find their way to the top of any bestseller list.  But this book is different.  It was written specifically for a general audience rather than for professors and grad students; so it tries to keep the tone light and informal, avoiding the arcane language of statistics in favor of simple descriptions and visual illustrations.  You don't need to know what a \\"chi-square\\" or a \\"Pearson's r\\" is in order to understand the research findings summarized in this book.  All you need is university-level English literacy and the ability to follow a trend line on a graph.  That's one reason why, if I had to recommend just one book for anyone interested in finding out the most important lessons we've learned from the scientific study of war and peace, this is the book I'd have to recommend -- not because it's the best, or the most comprehensive, or the most in-depth; but because it's the most accessible.  (Of course, I intend this as no slight to any of my colleagues and former professors who have written their own books on the subject -- in particular my dissertation advisor, John A. Vasquez, whose seminal work, \\"The War Puzzle\\", which has recently been revised and updated as \\"The War Puzzle Revisited\\", is one of the best books ever written on the causes of war, and is worth reading even if you have no background in international relations.  Yet, I still feel that Pinker's book is more accessible to lay readers.)<br /><br />You might find it a bit strange that I would recommend a book by Steven Pinker as your introduction to peace science.  After all, Pinker is not generally recognized as a \\"peace scientist\\" in the strictest sense of the term -- i.e. he has not devoted his career to studying the causes of war.  Rather, he is a world-famous experimental psychologist and cognitive scientist who is best known for his work on how the mind works and, especially, how it processes language.  His previous books (which are well worth reading, by the way) have all focused on these subjects.  This new book is Pinker's first foray into the field of peace science.  But he does an excellent job of summarizing what peace science has discovered about war and peace in language that is clear and easy to understand; and he manages to put the findings of peace science into a larger context of what is known about violence in general -- a topic that is perhaps best explored by a psychologist such as Pinker.  Perhaps more importantly, Pinker is an excellent writer who is able to present scientific findings to a general audience in a way that makes sense, but without in any way \\"dumbing down\\" the material.  Unlike many other academic writers, Pinker's writing style is engaging and entertaining -- his tone is conversational rather than professorial -- and yet he is careful to give proper citations for every substantive point he makes (he includes 41 pages of end notes, and 33 pages of bibliography).  I should also note that Pinker is very thorough in his analysis.  This is a very lengthy tome, running for nearly 700 pages (not counting the front matter, end notes, bibliography, etc.).  It may take you a while to read; but it's worth every minute; and, if you're anything like me, you'll actually enjoy it.<br /><br />Since my background is in peace science, my review has thus far focused on what Pinker has to say about war.  But that's just one part of what this book is about.  This is really a book about violence -- all types of violence, both large scale and small -- and war is just organized violence on an extremely large scale.  War is arguably the most important form of violence; but it's not the only form.  As it is usually understood, \\"violence\\" can include anything from full-scale war, to limited military action, to genocide, to ethnic conflict, to government oppression and human rights abuses, to religious persecution, to slavery, to terrorism, to lynching and other hate crimes, to murder, to capital punishment, to torture, to rape, to spousal and child abuse, to assault, to dueling, to bullying, to animal cruelty, to the spanking of naughty children.  Scholars who study international conflict tend to focus on the unique geopolitical factors that lead nations to send soldiers into battle -- factors that are not relevant to our understanding of violence committed on smaller scales.  But might it be possible that the root causes of large scale violence are to be found in the very same pathologies of human nature and human culture that give rise to honor killings, witch hunts, blood sports, hazing rituals, and even bar fights?  Pinker believes that it is; and he marshals a considerable body of evidence to support that view.<br /><br />He argues that all acts of violence, regardless of their scale, begin with decisions made by individuals; and, like all decisions, the decision to use violence is the product of cognitive processes that take place in our brains.  And understanding how these cognitive processes work is Steven Pinker's particular area of expertise.  Based on this understanding, Pinker is able to show how our brains make the decision of whether or not to use violence, and what factors influence this decision.  There are a number of factors that work to push us towards using violence, and a number of other factors that work to restrain us from using violence.  Some of these factors are internal (or internalized), such as our natural instincts for self-preservation, our moral values, and our capacity for empathy, self-control, and rational thought.  Other factors are external, such as the norms of the society we live in, the constraints imposed on our behavior by various social institutions, and the specific demands of the situation we happen to find ourselves in at any given time.  A violent act is the end result of a complex cognitive process -- most of which takes place below the level of our conscious awareness -- which takes all of these internal and external factors into account.  That's why violence is not a constant.  Sometimes people are violent; sometimes they're not.  An individual might use violence under certain circumstances but not under others.  Some people are more prone to violence than are others.  Some places experience more violence than do others.  And some historical periods have been more violent than have others.  Violence is variable.  It waxes and wanes in response to various influences.  Understanding these influences is the key to understanding violence of all kinds, and how to bring it under control.<br /><br />Violence will always be a part of the human experience; but it need not be its defining feature.  We'll never completely eliminate violence from our world -- there will always be occasional muggings, rapes, murders, human rights violations, acts of terrorism, and even wars -- but we can reduce these things to the point where people need not live in constant fear for their safety.  And we've already made a lot of progress in this direction.  Using a wealth of statistical evidence, Pinker shows that we are living in what is perhaps the least violent period in the history of the human race.  All forms of violence -- everything from war, to genocide, to religious persecution, to murder, to rape, to capital punishment, to torture, to animal cruelty, to the spanking of children -- are at historically low levels; and most of them have been in a state of nearly constant decline for centuries (with a few temporary setbacks in the 20th century).  This may be hard for many people to believe, since our popular culture and the 24-hour news media are constantly bombarding us with images of violence, and since most people have a rather poor grasp of history; but if you take an objective look at the level of violence we see in the world today compared to the level of violence our ancestors lived with in centuries past, it becomes quite clear that we are now living in a golden age of relative peace and security that our great great great great great grandparents could never have imagined.<br /><br />What is the cause of this decline in violence?  This is the main question that Pinker tries to answer in this book.  I won't attempt to summarize his findings here -- it's better if you read Pinker's argument, and the evidence he presents in support of it, for yourself.  But I will say that it has a lot to do with my second field of study: political development and modernization.  The world is becoming less violent as it modernizes and becomes more politically developed.  This also helps to explain why some parts of the world are much more violent than others, even today, since political development has not been uniform around the globe.  The least developed countries tend to be the most violent, and the most developed tend to be the least violent.  You might suspect that this is simply a matter of economics -- i.e. that violence is a byproduct of poverty, so richer countries would tend to be less violent than poorer countries -- but it's actually a lot more complicated than that.  (After all, the United States is a very rich country; but it's a lot more violent than Canada, Western Europe, and other parts of the First World.)  So the real explanation has more to do with politics and culture than with economics.  I'm not going to try to summarize in a few sentences what Pinker spent nearly 700 pages trying to explain -- you really do need to read the book for yourself -- but I will note that Pinker's theory is consistent with what we know about political development and modernization, and is certainly consistent with my own personal views on the subject.  I think that Pinker's explanation for why violence has declined over time is essentially correct, and needs to be taken seriously.<br /><br />If you want to understand the historical decline of violence you really must read Pinker's book.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.  However, I ought to point out that there are things in this book that some people may find disturbing or offensive.  For one thing, in order to fully convince the reader that the world is much less violent today than at any time in the past, Pinker catalogues, in gruesome detail, forms of brutality that were quite commonplace at one time, but that are simply unimaginable today.  He describes sadistic methods of torture and public execution that were once deemed perfectly just and proper, but that utterly shock the conscience of the modern reader.  He discusses military tactics that were considered perfectly normal centuries ago, but that would be condemned as war crimes or acts of genocide today.  He even talks about various acts of animal cruelty that our ancestors would have viewed as entirely unremarkable, such as the common pastime of torturing cats to death, which was a popular form of public entertainment in Medieval Europe.  The book also includes very frank discussions of rape, domestic violence, and abuse, which may not be suitable for some readers, who may find some of this material disturbing, or perhaps even triggering.  Some readers may even be offended by some of the things that Pinker has to say.  He is not a fan of \\"political correctness\\", and refuses to censor himself or to sweep inconvenient truths under the rug simply to appease those who might not like what he has to say.  He is willing to challenge the conventional wisdom if it is not supported by adequate evidence; and he even has the temerity to debunk some of the popular myths about violence that routinely get cited as \\"facts\\" in the media, in public discussions about violence, and even (sadly) in academic literature.  Pinker's objective in this book is to set the facts straight, even if he has to ruffle a few feathers in the process.  He has some harsh words for religion, which are bound to offend some believers.  While he does not condemn religion wholesale in the manner of the so-called \\"New Atheists\\" like Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens, he does strongly criticize the ancient moral codes that many of the world's major religions are built on.  Pinker draws our attention to the many barbaric passages in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) that,for example, command God's \\"chosen people\\" to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the cities they conquer; that prescribe death by stoning as the appropriate punishment for all manner of petty offenses and unconventional sexual proclivities; and that even permit men to own slaves and to obtain wives and concubines by abducting and raping foreign women.  Pinker is careful to point out that most modern Jews and Christians ignore these troublesome passages, and utterly reject them as guides to moral behavior in the modern world.  He insists that his purpose in highlighting the flaws in the biblical conception of morality is not to cast aspersions on modern-day believers, but simply to illustrate how far we've come in our understanding of right and wrong -- particularly when it comes to the use of violence and how we treat other human beings -- since the Hebrew Bible was written.  But he does call our attention to the dangers of trying to base one's morality on these ancient texts, which reflect pre-modern values that most people today -- including most contemporary Christians and Jews -- would find not only abhorrent, but ungodly.  So, some believers will likely take offense at Pinker's comments, especially if they're not accustomed to viewing their faith traditions and their scriptures with a critical eye.  But you can't please everyone; so it's better just to speak the truth as you see it, and not worry about who might take offense.  That's what Pinker does; and I have to admire him for it.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the best books I've read in years.  I highly recommend it.olence than are others.  Some places experience more violence than do others.  And some historical periods have been more violent than have others.  Violence is variable.

All forms of violence -- everything from war, to genocide, to religious persecution, to murder, to rape, to capital punishment, to torture, to animal cruelty, to the spanking of children -- are at historically low levels; and most of them have been in a state of nearly constant decline for centuries (with a few temporary setbacks in the 20th century).  This may be hard for many people to believe, since our popular culture and the 24-hour news media are constantly bombarding us with images of violence, and since most people have a rather poor grasp of history; but if you take an objective look at the level of violence we see in the world today compared to the level of violence our ancestors lived with in centuries past, it becomes quite clear that we are now living in a golden age of relative peace and security that our great great great great great grandparents could never have imagined.<br /><br />What is the cause of this decline in violence?  This is the main question that Pinker tries to answer in this book.  I won't attempt to summarize his findings here -- it's better if you read Pinker's argument, and the evidence he presents in support of it, for yourself.  But I will say that it has a lot to do with my second field of study: political development and modernization.  The world is becoming less violent as it modernizes and becomes more politically developed.  This also helps to explain why some parts of the world are much more violent than others, even today, since political development has not been uniform around the globe.  The least developed countries tend to be the most violent, and the most developed tend to be the least violent.  You might suspect that this is simply a matter of economics -- i.e. that violence is a byproduct of poverty, so richer countries would tend to be less violent than poorer countries -- but it's actually a lot more complicated than that.  (After all, the United States is a very rich country; but it's a lot more violent than Canada, Western Europe, and other parts of the First World.)  So the real explanation has more to do with politics and culture than with economics.  I'm not going to try to summarize in a few sentences what Pinker spent nearly 700 pages trying to explain -- you really do need to read the book for yourself -- but I will note that Pinker's theory is consistent with what we know about political development and modernization, and is certainly consistent with my own personal views on the subject.  I think that Pinker's explanation for why violence has declined over time is essentially correct, and needs to be taken seriously.<br /><br />If you want to understand the historical decline of violence you really must read Pinker's book.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.  However, I ought to point out that there are things in this book that some people may find disturbing or offensive.  For one thing, in order to fully convince the reader that the world is much less violent today than at any time in the past, Pinker catalogues, in gruesome detail, forms of brutality that were quite commonplace at one time, but that are simply unimaginable today.  He describes sadistic methods of torture and public execution that were once deemed perfectly just and proper, but that utterly shock the conscience of the modern reader.  He discusses military tactics that were considered perfectly normal centuries ago, but that would be condemned as war crimes or acts of genocide today.  He even talks about various acts of animal cruelty that our ancestors would have viewed as entirely unremarkable, such as the common pastime of torturing cats to death, which was a popular form of public entertainment in Medieval Europe.  The book also includes very frank discussions of rape, domestic violence, and abuse, which may not be suitable for some readers, who may find some of this material disturbing, or perhaps even triggering.  Some readers may even be offended by some of the things that Pinker has to say.  He is not a fan of \\"political correctness\\", and refuses to censor himself or to sweep inconvenient truths under the rug simply to appease those who might not like what he has to say.  He is willing to challenge the conventional wisdom if it is not supported by adequate evidence; and he even has the temerity to debunk some of the popular myths about violence that routinely get cited as \\"facts\\" in the media, in public discussions about violence, and even (sadly) in academic literature.  Pinker's objective in this book is to set the facts straight, even if he has to ruffle a few feathers in the process.  He has some harsh words for religion, which are bound to offend some believers.  While he does not condemn religion wholesale in the manner of the so-called \\"New Atheists\\" like Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens, he does strongly criticize the ancient moral codes that many of the world's major religions are built on.  Pinker draws our attention to the many barbaric passages in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) that,for example, command God's \\"chosen people\\" to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the cities they conquer; that prescribe death by stoning as the appropriate punishment for all manner of petty offenses and unconventional sexual proclivities; and that even permit men to own slaves and to obtain wives and concubines by abducting and raping foreign women.  Pinker is careful to point out that most modern Jews and Christians ignore these troublesome passages, and utterly reject them as guides to moral behavior in the modern world.  He insists that his purpose in highlighting the flaws in the biblical conception of morality is not to cast aspersions on modern-day believers, but simply to illustrate how far we've come in our understanding of right and wrong -- particularly when it comes to the use of violence and how we treat other human beings -- since the Hebrew Bible was written.  But he does call our attention to the dangers of trying to base one's morality on these ancient texts, which reflect pre-modern values that most people today -- including most contemporary Christians and Jews -- would find not only abhorrent, but ungodly.  So, some believers will likely take offense at Pinker's comments, especially if they're not accustomed to viewing their faith traditions and their scriptures with a critical eye.  But you can't please everyone; so it's better just to speak the truth as you see it, and not worry about who might take offense.  That's what Pinker does; and I have to admire him for it.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the best books I've read in years.  I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book starts off slow at first but once you get passed chapter 6. You will not be able to put it down.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|First of all, let me say that I have been a Ken Follett fan for several years, and I consider some of his books among my favorites.  I liked Fall of Giants enough that I was looking forward to Winter of the World.  I thought I would enjoy it even more because so much of the story took place during my lifetime.  However, this was not the case. At times it didn't feel like a Follett book. I was so disappointed that I now regret spending $20 for the e-book and will never do that again. On my budget, it's too much to risk.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love love loved being able to purchase the entire fourth season! I watched the first three seasons on Netflix and could Not wait for the fourth season to be added to the playlist! Purchase was super easy--as usual-- with On Demand, picture quality & connectivity were also superb!<br /> I love being able to watch what I want when I want without having to store dvds (already have too many). SOA is totally worth the purchase price! A fun & addictive show ;)

B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a brilliant movie.  But it is not a feel good movie, and anything but a \\"love conquers all\\" movie.  These people are deeply flawed and even tragic.  They also have talents.  They don't rise above their circumstances or afflictions (the scene on the bus should take care of that notion).  They concede.  Even to call it a Rom-Com is to grossly miss the point.  More like \\"Cuckoo's nest\\" with nicer people.  They are good people who find a way of adapting (precariously) to their reality.

B005LAIHPY|2.0|I did not have very high hopes when I rented this film from the local Major Movie Rental Chain Store. What was I expecting, this is a movie \\"inspired\\" by a board game that I played when I was a kid back in 1978. My primary mode of transportation back in those days was a Schwinn Stingray. I really tried to like this movie. The action sequences were very well done and the special effects are FLAWLESS. Especially the scenes where the CGI Battleship U.S.S. Missouri fires on the alien Mothership. However, the cliched hero, the hopeless dialogue and the typical stock characters just made this a bad Transformers rip off.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|Been a fan since 1978 and a huge one too, have had the pleasure of meeting the guys (back when you didn't have to pay 1k for it) and they were amazing and very kind.<br />I can find something to appreciate in almost every album including (Music From) The Elder and Peter Criss' seriously underrated 1978 solo album, however Monster leaves me cold, at least what I heard of it.<br />That's right, I could only get through some of it, I found it dull, bland and uninspired as well as very derivative of previous efforts.<br />'All For The Love Of Rock and Roll' sounds like an Eric Singer update of Mr.Speed from the infinitely superior Rock and Roll Over album. The guitar solo for 'Long Way Down' pretty much put me to sleep and I had to turn it off, so strange since Tommy Thayer is a great guitarist as evidenced by his work in Black N Blue and his many shining moments on their previous effort Sonic Boom. The lead-off track and first single Hell Or Hallelujah sounds a lot like I Stole Your Love mixed with All American Man, though the lyrics are nowhere near as memorable nor are the vocals.<br />A Monster mini-golf? A Monster book with a price tag exceeding 4k? and a lackluster album with performances that seem phoned in and semi-comatose combined with album cover art that looks like an old Metal Edge magazine outtake. I really don't know what's up with KISS these days, but they bare little resemblance to the band that released such fiery efforts as Hotter Than Hell or Destroyer.<br />Hell, I'll even take Animalize and Asylum over this any day. Alongside, Crazy Nights, Hot In The Shade, and Carnival of Souls this is a twilight zone moment in the band's career. Dull and lethargic in execution and production, the mighty have fallen though it pains me to say it.

B008KYOCA2|5.0|I wasn't sure I could believe the glowing reviews about this free calendar but they were all true. This is the calendar I'd searched for. Very customizable with many built-in features that make it more than convenient, they make it a highly valued tool. Lots of well thought out nicities, like the reveal of the detailed day's activities with a single press of a specific calendar date. It's actually fun to use. This is a gift from the developers. Thank you!
B007SSDDWE|3.0|Not really much to say outside of this being an interesting concept but very poor execution.  The movie is way too short...entertaining to waste a bit of time but nothing that will leave a mark on one's memory that lasts a long time.

B005LAII9Y|4.0|This certainly has been the year for supernaturally-themed animated features. First we had \\"Paranorman,\\" which I enjoyed very much. Then came \\"Hotel Transylvania,\\" which has been doing HUGE box-office (but which I never got around to seeing yet, due in part to the fact that I heartily dislike some of the key vocal performers). And now there is \\"Frankenweenie,\\" which I saw today.<br /><br />I should state at the outset that I absolutely LOVED the 30-minute black-and-white short \\"Frankenweenie,\\" which was made nearly thirty years ago. It's just about perfect, and if you haven't seen it yet----by all means check it out at once!<br /><br />So,I was curious as to how this longer version would compare. I did enjoy it very much, but wasn't quite as thrilled with it as I had hoped to be. In the end, I think that the short version really is the superior film. I think the problem with the remake is that it doesn't really provide any additional character development or depth to the story; the extended length seems mostly to be filler for me. The only sequences added to the new version that I thought added substantially to the story at all, were the scenes with Victor's science teacher. (Though make no mistake, those scenes are marvelous---visually the teacher is a caricature of Vincent Price, and he is voiced by Martin Landau---who of course played Bela Lugosi in Burton's fantastic film \\"Ed Wood.\\")<br /><br />This film really is like old home week as far as the vocal casting is concerned; just about everyone in it has had something to do with previous Burton efforts. The voices are perfect, and the animation very nicely done with a retro look that is perfectly appropriate to the source material. (It doesn't really compare to the fantastic \\"Paranorman,\\" but then it isn't supposed to.)<br /><br />So, despite some reservations, I do recommend this as a great way to introduce kids to classic cinema monster mythology. It is PERFECT viewing for the month of October, with Halloween just around the corner. I'm sorry to say that the box office returns have been modest (to put it politely); like \\"Paranorman,\\" I think this is a film that is likely to appeal to a specialised and limited audience. Though---as this is a black-and-white film that is a homage to the old 1930's Universal horror pictures, it's no surprise that the audience is even more limited than was that of \\"Paranorman\\"'s.<br /><br />(I'll add that I got a kick out of the fact that the character design of the dog is based on the lead in another old animated short, \\"The Family Dog,\\" which was shown on the series \\"Amazing Stories\\" back in the eighties.)ust around the corner.

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Great story about the pitfalls and triumphs of the human race.  The ending could have greatly been improved by a paragraph or two about Wade's next great adventure with Samantha.  The ending line should have then read 'READY PLAYER ONE.'
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Having read Fall of Giants, the first in this trilogy, last year I had been looking forward to the release of this book and I wasn't disappointed.  Ken Follet's characters feel so real and give you a real insight into what it was like to live through the events of the period upto, during and after the Second World War.  Although I think you could read and enjoy this book as a stand alone I would highly recommend reading [[ASIN:0451232852 Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy]] first.  If you are the sort of reader who likes to lose yourself in the lives of the characters in the book you are reading this is for you.  I plan on getting my teenagers to read it to make sure the lessons learnt in Europe in this period are not forgotten

0385344333|3.0|This Reacher novel is simply not up to the fans expectations. In A Wanted Man, our hero doesn't even get into a good fight !  There seems to be little emotion in the characters, even when a main character and FBI agent gets killed in the end.<br /><br />The only part worth reading is Reacher's explanation of \\"how to talk for a minute or more and never use the letter \\"A\\"'.<br /><br />Come on Mr. Child, you can do better than this ! Your credibility is sorely in question once you allowed diminutive Tom Cruise to portray Jack Reacher. What were you thinking ?<br /><br />The next Reacher novel better be ten times better than the last two !

B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard a lot about this book so I was really interested in reading it. It hooked me quickly and kept my attention. The plot twists were nice though somewhat predictable. I would of gave this book a better review had it not of been for the ending. I feel like the writer was not sure how to end it so she just did. I felt let down, I got this great twisty story and then BLAH. DONE. I am usualy not one for changing books when they make them into movies but I really hope this one does.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|First off let me start this review by saying that until this CD Green Day was my favorite band.  But after the so-so nature of 21st Century Breakdown, they really needed a great CD.<br /><br />This isn't it.  Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible.  It has a couple of good songs on there.  But most you can only stand to listen to maybe once or twice.  It's hard to imagine that the same lyrical genius behind American Idiot wrote the Disney-like lyrics on this one.  Just completely uninspired.<br /><br />So they aren't a terrible band now, but your favorite band has to be great.  And although it breaks my heart to say so, but sadly they are not great anymore...
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Let me start off by saying this review is to balance out the one star ratings/low ratings this album will get from all the would be cry babies out there in Kiss Land. To everyone who will try to tell you you the album is this or that but in reality it is no more than a cry for help because Ace and Peter are not there. Of course if Gene and Paul left it up to these two guys there would be no Kiss. Can we all count the amount of Kiss albums there would not be if Gene and Paul let Ace and Peter control this band? There will be those who say it does not sound like this or it does not sound like that, well guess what not to many Kiss albums sound like each other. If that is what you want go listen to an ACDC or Iron Maiden album. I know they can help you out. I love them but they are not Kiss. Tonight I will go with my eight year old son to buy his first Kiss album. I know it will be as special as when I bought Love Gun from Barkers in 77. Kiss continues on, come along for the ride or get out of the way, 1975 is a long time ago.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was very well written and interesting. I am grateful to Mark Owen for taking the time to set the record straight on a lot of things. Everyone should read this book to get a better understanding of the supreme sacrafices that are made every day to protect our freedom.

To Mark Owen \\"Thank you and may God forever keep you safe.\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this as the Kindle Daily Deal after reading a sample. This book made it so I check out every daily deal so I do not miss out on another good read.  Just amazing.  Does not slow down for a second.  The characters are defined enough to get to know them without getting too far into them to take away from the big picture of the story.  I have been turned on to a new author and I am beyond excited.  I just bought First Shift-Legacy and I cannot wait to get in to it.  Great job Mr. Howey.  I am officially a fan and up until now I would only say that about Stephen King.
0525953728|4.0|Far to many 'axe to grind' people have made there opinions known about the book without actually commenting (or reading according to a number of them) upon the book itself. It is unfortunate that it was used as a 'political football' rather than being judged on it's own merit.<br />It is a great story about a small group of hard working heros who tackle whatever job is sent their way, even the ones that could likely be their last. It is not 'great literature' (whatever that really is - I don't read 'Shakespeare' for enjoyment so what do I know), it also doesn't give away any secrets that put our country or those who defend it at risk, there is far more 'secret' information available on the Discovery Channel. Mark Owen (I guess his true identity HAS been released on TV) and his fellow SEALS have been criticised for 'coming off' as arrogant and overly agressive, that may be true but as counter point, who else would ever train that hard, learn all that they do and then take on missions likely to result in death or injury to themselves and their best friends? I for one don't want passive SEALS, Special Forces or Firefighters for that matter. I really enjoyed the book, I will no doubt read it again. I am not bothered that SEALs are human, have likes and dislikes that may differ from my own or that they occasionally resort to 'foul' language (although there is none included in the book that I hadn't heard from students, many years ago when I worked in a school of 3rd graders) while under stress. If those things bother you, this might not be the book for you to read. If you want an inside look at some of what our bravest warriors do, I think that you will be pleased.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pretty good app, a few hiccups here and there, but I can look past them. I haven't had any major issues, just the occasional non loading when I open...makes me force close.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I read this entire book wanting for the excellence that everyone had been talking about.  I have read some books and thought that I had wasted my time or that other readers must have read more into the book than I did, but this book (to me) is a YA fantasy about what the first year of college would be if you did not need to have a job, had money coming from somewhere, met the tattooed man of your dreams, and ran off to live happily ever after!  This book was so UNREALISTIC that I just can not recommend it for anyone looking for even a crazy \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" romance type read.  This one should stay on the shelf!
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Great compilation of songs sung by hall of fame musicians.  Worth having in your collection.  Combination of country music and rock.  Foot tapping and sing-a-long songs.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Having read all the previous books, I found this one not up to par.  The first segment of the book,where the story is told through different lives, and eventually all connect, was brilliant, typical Lee Child structure at it's very best, but the remainder seemed slow and ponderous.
B007FH22VQ|5.0|Fantastic release by Meshuggah. Swarm is my particular favorite. This is one of their darkest and most complex works to date. Should put to rest any ill-conceived notions that metal is not a serious genre of music.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|This album is excellent. Glad to see Ellie not just doing the same old thing but still growing and changing as an artist. I hope she keeps it up, and tours Portland and Seattle soon.
B007THA4FI|5.0|YES, this book was written by the author of the immensely popular Harry Potter series. NO, this book is NOT Harry Potter.<br /><br />It's gritty, it's real, it's emotional. It has characters that sometimes have no redeeming qualities, but yet you come to feel for them, with them and hope that in some way they can find some sort of peace.<br /><br />This book is a journey, and as in all journey's the beginning is new. The scene has to be set, the characters have to have life breathed into them. We are along for the journey of Pagford and it's surrounding environs. JK Rowling has a way of making her characters real. Perhaps like people you may know or be related to. Most of them you will dislike, and almost none you will love.<br /><br />In the end it punches you in the gut. And if you have come to have any emotional feelings for the characters whether it be hate, pity, scorn, you will feel the rawness of that punch.<br /><br />This book has cemented my belief in J K Rowling as an author and storyteller, crossing over from YA to Adult in one fluid sweep.

0307887448|5.0|This is a great book, you don't need to be a fan of science fiction, the 80's or video games to enjoy, but if you are then you're in for a special treat. The author writes fluidly and is very entertaining. With a lot of science fiction/fantasy I sometimes have a difficult time imagining the picture that the author is trying to paint (cities/scenery etc etc), this author writes in such a way that most settings/surroundings are easily imagined.<br /><br />It all starts with a really great story about a down and out high school kid in a futuristic society in which there is an all out treasure hunt (via an online videogame-sounds lame but it's really awesome) for a recently deceased super billionaires real fortune (think Gates + Jobs)  with good characters and a good plot that is constantly moving forward with a good dash of suspense. .<br /><br />Plain and simple, this book should be nominated for a Hugo.
B005PK56TA|5.0|A great and wildly inventive series that slowly builds up over time. This is a definite break over most recent horror entries. Can't wait for season 2.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm hooked!!!!! I love this app and being able to make multiple boards. Cant wait to start making some dishes
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I wasn't completely sold on this series based on how the first book ended, but I decided to give it a try. There were moments in this book that I just wanted to put it down and not finish. The relationship with Eva and Gideon is so insecure that it brings out the worst in each of them. A couple of sex scenes came across as almost violent and aggressive, not as a reflection of their love for each other, which made it difficult for me to relate to... and left me feeling disturbed. There just seemed to be too many struggles written in to the story that it became unenjoyable to read. I'm hoping the next book will produce stronger and healthier characters, rather than overly needy and tortured. Everything in this book screamed unhealthy to me.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read each of the Reacher Novels by Lee Child and eagerly await each one.  A Wanted Man is an excellent read but as usual, it ends all too soon.
B0018RA6DK|5.0|it's good to watch any eddie murphy movie uncut and commercial free! would like to have his whole collection, great actor
B00846REIS|5.0|I ordered this after reading the Fifty Shades trilogy. There are some similarities. It's a good, fast read. I recommend it if you're a Fifty Shades fan!
B00932A2MC|5.0|good movie. sci-fi combo's from others. rihanna never lost her \\"cover\\". great overall action and homage to vets. I teared up on that. ex navy. they traveled thru space, hit a satellite and tore up one of their ships. hmm!! what's next?
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is easy, fun and soothing. You can select the number of pieces to the puzzle as well as there are many different puzzles.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|This product was OK as far as carrying the Kindle and keeping it safe, but I think it would be more convenient to have a carrier that allowed you to read the kindle while keeping it in the case
B00881VLCE|2.0|free or not, this is just boring. 1/2 the time rotate doesn't work anyway. no challenge to it except for trying to make it work. Prob good for kids
B009A3NGF4|3.0|I am pretty new to Mumford & Sons but I took a chance to sample their Sigh No More album and I agree with the low raters that it all sounds the same. Babel and I Will Wait are amazing songs but I just could not buy the whole album and listen to it in entirety, I will stick to youtubing the other songs I like as I have the two mentioned above on my ipod. . .kudos to them though .. .great sound.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Keyboard suggests words and makes typing easy.<br />So far I have enjoyed the app.  I tried the free trail and decided to buy the app.  Hope you like it.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|If you have even a modicum of affection or respect for the original TV series from 1966-71, you will not buy this movie, you will not rent it, you will not watch clips of it. You will run, not walk, in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Tim Burton and Johnny Depp clearly don't understand the meaning of \\"homage.\\" Homage flatters and honors. This movie ridiculed. In the late and wonderful Jonathan Frid's hands, the character of Barnabas Collins was poignant, nuanced, and at times, quite scary. Johnny Depp turned the character into a candy-colored clown.<br /><br />Even if you are a Burton/Depp fan (and I used to be), you'll see this film for what it is: a complete mishmash that has no clue what it wants to be. Subplots are thrown in, characters reduced to a single note, lots of flash but no substance.<br /><br />I was, and still am, a huge fan of the series. When I saw this movie in the theater, I left in tears. If it were possible to give it negative stars, I would do so.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Even my wife, who usually does not read mysteries could not put this one down.  In fact, she read it first and was constantly surprised by the twists and turns that the book throws at you.  I bought it and blitzed thru it, unable to put it down for long.  I highly recommend this book.  Go get it, find a comfortable chair, and enjoy.
0714864803|5.0|This is a beautiful cook book. A good mix of dishes in the classic Middle Eastern tradition (with that little extra touch) and imaginative takes on the traditional kitchen. The 500 recipes cover everything from fish/meat to deserts/jams. Can highly recommend for any body interested in Lebanese food. And if you're not interested yet, this will definitely get you hooked!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I'm a big fan of all of Gregory's Cousin's War books and this newest one doesn't disappoint. It was great to read about this time in history from a different perspective than the white and red queen.  I blew through this book very quickly and hated having to put it down. The story is so engrossing it's hard to imagine at times that her books are based on true points in history.  If you like Gregory's other books then you'll love this one as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is far better. The authors crafting of her characters far exceeds 50 Shades. The careful revealing of their secrets keeps you interested and turning the pages.
B009CPES4I|5.0|For those who understand my review title, this is for you. Hilarious situations yet believable actors. Judi Dench can play any roll so very well but she excels in this one.
B009GCF3Q4|1.0|Not impressed with this short story book.  Connelly has decided to go for a quick buck rather than continue to write the great novels he is known for.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many wonderful ideas!! I love to look around pinterest during late night nursing sessions with my son! I have made many dinners with recipes I have found on pinterest.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is very fun but as you progress in levels it will take longer and longer to do anything. it gets to the point where you check in and play only a minute or two a day. unless you want to spend real money. that being said it is one of the better Sim games out there.
0375507256|5.0|I am not finished with Cloud Atlas yet, because I am savoring every page.  This is a clever, funny and totally absorbing novel.  I also look forward to the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|its a great app!! If you have kids at home or you yourself need a quick calculator this is the app you want!!
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed the book a lot  nice to hear a first hand account with no political lies.  I appreciate what the Seals do for our country.  Good feeling to know they are there to protect us.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Loving classical music, this album is a mix of old and some new(for me) exciting music.  I now look forward to a Fifty Shades of Grey album with other songs mentioned in the book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Exceptional book! Purchasing the trilogy is a must!! Happy I decided to read it. Looking forward to a fourth book.
B000053VAZ|2.0|Very average movie, Jonny Debbie as wonderful as ever. If you want to see it then rent it, not a keeper
B00992CF6W|5.0|no more words its still the best of the best of the best I mean this game is going to an outbreak in world history.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This app was very fun to play and I like how it makes you think. About how to get as many guys in as little moves as possible
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read some interesting stories and don't get easily freaked out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I personally love these books! I bought them for my kindle and so glad I did. I would not have wanted to wait to get the second one when I finished the first one. I have not read a better book for a long time!
0385344333|1.0|Is Lee Child out of all ideas? The worst book he has written. Many redundant words with the only purpose - to fill empty pages.
B0002XV2WK|5.0|Awesome live album.  Just had the privilege of seeing America play in Australia.  They just get better with age. I always feel very nostalgic when listening to some of their hits, memories of a great time.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a compact flash that makes a big impact.  Have used it several times within the past month and it makes a significant difference in picture quality.  Highly recommended!
B001HN697M|5.0|If you have never seen the Underworld franchise, here is the order you should watch the films. First, watch this one. It is technically number three, but it should be number 0 because it happens before the first one. Then, watch the first one, since that was okay. Then, skip the other two, because they suck and don't bring much to the table, although if you REALLY insist you can watch the second one because she does get nekkid in that one. You can probably fast forward to the part though and ignore the rest of the movie. But don't watch the fourth one at all, it's boring and doesn't make sense and the lycans are sort of lame and scientisty and main vampire boobies chick has a kid (what) who looks like she's like 8 but she's probably 200 because, you know, vampire.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I do not normally listen to classical music but this collection has made me rethink what I listen to. This is my go to album now!
B002R1Q8RO|3.0|The book by Carl Hiassen was awesome - a page turner!  After reading the book, I wanted to watch this old movie that I had<br />seen when it first came out years ago.  I couldn't even remember the movie so that says something about it.  The King could<br />hardly stay awake until the end.  But I was more interested in seeing how the story was transformed into the movie.<br /><br />The movie makers followed the plot and characters pretty closely which was good, until the end, where they seem to have either a)<br />run out of the alloted 'movie theatre time limit\\" or b) ran out of money to finish it properly.  The end in the book was WAY better<br />and would have saved this movie had they played it out.<br /><br />Oh, and Demi Moore's dancing ... well it's about the dorkiest thing I've ever seen - ha ha!  And, anybody who's EVER seen a strip<br />joint and seen real dancers would agree, this is SO far from the mark.  VERY HOKEY.  But I suppose if you're a Demi Moore fan, you might get excited to see her big 'reveal' - they tease you with that until the end.  She does have an awesome body, but she's not very sexy...just sayin'.
B0086HGW42|4.0|I am now in love with Ed Sheeran. He has the type of voice that really let's the emotion of a song come through. His lyrics are beautiful and deep too. It feels like they are pulled from his own life experiences. The music was more diverse than I thought it would be. The songs had a pop/rap/soul feel to them. Some more pop & others more acoustic.This album is in my frequently played list.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Even tho the game isn't really challenging I find myself wanting to play it daily and I've even caught myself yelling at my kindle when coins fall off the side!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Because the book doesn't explain  it like the movie I like the movie better then the book I saw the movie and it was good except for the other stuff but it was good I saw it
0525953728|5.0|Excellent, highly recommend purchasing.  Fast, great read~  Taken into the book with a better understanding of how the SEALS risk their lives, while the government tap dances and takes credit.  The credit belongs to those who commit years to keeping our country safe from terrorists, who put themselves on the line, and makes last second desicions.  Vote Romney!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this was an amazing read. Before I was even half way through I found myself gushing about it to my friends. I couldn't put down after the initial intro and it had me thinking the entire time. I just wish the ending was a little more solid vs what actually happens. This book had me going though! It was Criminal Minds (but not as scary) meets CSI meets suspense. It is a must read!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|My all-time favorite television series is HBO's Carnivale. I used to sit on the edge of my seat each week watching it, and then spend the rest of the week talking with friends about what we thought, and trying to guess where the show was headed. When the show got cancelled I was so upset, and I wondered if another show would ever come along that I would get as excited about. Well, that show has arrived. American Horror Story is the perfect combination of horror, suspense, history and drama. Every week unveils a little more, and adds more questions. And they all get answered...but in a much better way than you could ever imagine. I am going back and watching it again now, and it is even better the second time through. I cannot wait to watch it with the commentary. And the new season is only a week away. Can't wait!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Oh Good Lord!  My emotions are raw!  Loved it, but wish the ending did not seem so rushed and that some of our questions remained unanswered.......good time for a break!  Looking forward to December!
B008Y5OWMK|3.0|This is a character movie, not an action filled western.  It is less about the cattle war and more about the people involved and how the events impacted the people. The movie is too long especially the first half. The editing and sound could be better and the movie expects you to fill in some of the blanks such as how the beginning Harvard graduation and dance connect with the ending boat chapter and what it all means. Overall it is a good movie.  With better ediiting and an hour shorter it could have been great.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The most flawless app that I have installed on my Motorola ATRIX to date. Amazingly detailed analysis of you device battery usage and charging state with remaining life available down to the second for every conceivable form of media. Informs you of individual app usage in standby and active modes as well as supplying app management options such as force stop. An excellent sharp graphics design and data layout with easy to read text. Nothing is held back on the free version, there is just a marginal banner ad, nothing to distract from the experience. Updated regularly and completely worth your time to take for a spin. I recommend supporting this developer, I'd like to see them still putting out great products for future devices. Deepest thanks to them for this awesome app.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|too bad that this Bible app requires so many permissions to run. it even gets access to your account like Google ..... Live.com..... Hotmail..... yahoomail... etc. And besides that. it runs all the time even if you stop it. uninstalling .... and find a new app.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Not only meet my expectations. I would say it exceed it enormously.<br /><br />I think one of the best musical experiences in my life.<br /><br />Paramount of blues, music and understanding among artist.<br />I'm delighted<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0085KGHI6 Muddy Waters & The Rolling Stones Live At The Checkerboard Lounge, Chicago 1981 DVD/CD]]
B0091V6TF4|5.0|This is the 50th Anniversary of the cinematic James Bond film series and it would have been nice to have integrated familiar cuts and snippets of the melodies associated with the hallmark James Bond sound and theme interpolated throughout and still musically represent each film from DR. NO up to and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE. Given that this is a collection from 22 films, that could have been a daunting task, but far from impossible. My issues with this CD are with Disc 2 and what it really tried to capture.<br /><br />DR. NO, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE are well represented, considering the constraints, and it was very good to have the vocal version of Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang included on Disc 2. It would have been nice if actual instrumental cuts of John Barry's On HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS scores had been included on Disc 2 as well.<br /><br />I thought it was a shame that no instrumental cuts were included for Bill Conti's FOR YOUR EYES ONLY score, Eric Serra's GOLDENEYE score and David Arnold's scores for TOMORROW NEVER DIES, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and DIE ANOTHER DAY. In fact, there are no cuts for LICENCE TO KILL and DIE ANOTHER DAY on Disc 2. I find this to be very curious.<br /><br />For the James Bond enthusiast spirit in many of us I suppose it is still better than nothing at all for the 50th Anniversary. &quot;The Laser Beam&quot; from GOLDFINGER, &quot;Switching The Body&quot; from THUNDERBALL, &quot;Snow Job&quot; from A VIEW TO A KILL and &quot;Vesper&quot; from CASINO ROYALE are excellent cuts. However, this collection remains a curiosity piece and perfunctory at best.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Disappointing doesn't begin to describe.  Characters are pathetic.  It's a good thing that this is not her first writing attempt
B004T6IBNY|5.0|Just like it was years ago ... very good graphics and action!  Would recommend this to anyone with a passion for pinball !
0007466064|1.0|I cannot do a review on this product as it was ordered and shipped to another person as a gift.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I just bought the new Kiss cd called Monster and it's an ok cd. Not there best work. Not many hit songs on this cd.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I didn't want to stop reading. I was hooked from the first paragraph until the last. One thing just flowed into another and the book never ceased to keep my attention. Although it doesn't seem possible, everything comes together in the end.
B008CIUS72|5.0|read the title help it will not let me get this app i need it for my reading help please
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is so fun and addictive. I love playing it. It is fun to waste time.My kids ask me to play it everyday. I play it when I am bored or
B00499K9E0|5.0|This show captures the writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in a brilliant modern setting. As a fan of Doyle I do not like many of the Holmes knock-offs. The characters are well cast. I recommend the show to any Holmes fan as well as those who have never read the books.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was interesting to read some of what everybody is commenting on television especially the talk shows. It is a good book to read on a rainly day.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Have enjoyed all of Ken Follett's books over the years including Winter of the World and Fall of Giants.  Interesting to read about the different families in different parts of the world and the characters are cleverly intertwined into the story together with historical facts about the second world war.  Will be interesting to read the third in the series and am assuming it will cover current day politics, corruption, terrorism and the ever widening gap between the rich and the poor.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love it!  I gave it three stars because I can only pin from within.  I have this on my Kindle Fire and hope this gets fixed.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Thanks to a 3 minute advertisement that could not be skipped on each of the four discs, I knew the ending to the season before I saw the first episode of Season 6. Thanks a lot Showtime. More interested in promoting your other garbage programs than preserving the entertainment of the only program worth watching on your network.<br /><br />I'm taking this back for a full refund. I will, as of now, break with my tradition of purchasing every single Dexter season and will not be purchasing Season 7. Anger does not begin to describe it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love Flow Free. I'm a puzzle game person and this one really hits the spot. I be sure to get stars on every level. Thanks Big Duck!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This app works great on my US Cellular HTC Hero S. It provided many levels as well as online playing capabilities. It is very addicting.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I was so sad at the end of this story, I cried like a baby.  I lost a daughter back in 1984 and it brought back many sad memories.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a great sci-fi western series.  The episodes are so well done and engaging that you are literally shocked when the 45 minute episode ends because you could have sworn you had only been watching it for 15 minutes.  It amazes me that this program only lasted 1 season; what were the \\"powers-that-be\\" thinking when they canceled this series.  Luckily, the big screen movie continued the saga, because Firefly should have never been grounded.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The story of an abused girl who has been abused from childhood to adult by the government and is a genius and her life to freedom, the people that her life touches on make for a read unparalleled by any other story. A book that has a cult of followers including me. Read and enjoy.
