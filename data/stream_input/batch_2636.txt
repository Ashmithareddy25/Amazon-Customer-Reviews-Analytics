034580404X|5.0|I am not a person to read books but when I started to read the first book I got hooked...I read all 3 books in 2 weeks...I really recommend every woman to read it. It will spark something deep inside...you will know what i'm talking about when you read the book. Can't wait for the movie!!!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|My granddaughter and I went to see this together.  I liked it and so did she.  I finally got my husband to watch the video with me when it arrived.  It's a good movie and I can't wait for the second one to come out.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Love the &#34; popular boy likes a not so popular girls, but doesn't want anyone to know&#34; plot. Had some laugh out loud scenes and some memorable moments. Has humor only suitable for mature teenagers.
0345803485|4.0|I bought this for my mother.  I personally haven't read them, but she asked me to get them for her.  She thought they were very good.  Don't know anymore than that.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|One of the first shooters I played on the kindle.<br /> This is a fun game but you need to have fast fingers. You can progress without paying but the expensive weapons make the game easier so make your choice.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I liked Jack in the movies and I liked it when we watched it at home.  It's a good movie.  It didn't end quite the way I wanted it too, but it ended well.  I would have liked to have seen the giants returning home, but then one can't have everything.
1781162646|5.0|While not as in depth as King's other books, this was a thoroughly enjoyable story about relationships and then an interesting crime!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|It was an alright movie.  I liked it.  I bought it for my granddaughter though.  She saw it in the theater and really liked it.  My husband and I watched it and it was okay.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun puzzle game.  Me and my 11 year old son played it and had a blast.  The levels get more difficult as you go
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|We saw the movie in the theater and I knew I had to have it.  I have all the Die Hard movies and this one was a good ending to a long career in the Die Hard series.  I was pleased.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a Bruce Willis or Die Hard fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very addictive!  keep making more rooms!  its challenging but not too frustrating so you want to keep playing again and again.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great graphics and interesting theories. I hope the creators can keep up the dialogs &amp; new dinosaurs: Dimetredon, Trilobites, Icthyosaurs.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Ending too abrupt.....also she jumped from one love scene to tons  of e mails all dated weeks later to a whole another time in their lives.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|SO much fun to play this addictive game.  Fun for the whole family.  A must buy..This game will test you in so many ways..
B00008G7UJ|1.0|Good movie. Too bad the disc skipped every couple of seconds so I couldnt even watch it. Thanks. This dvd is useless to me. glad I wasted my money.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After reading the first book in the series, I had high hopes for the other two.  The second one was alright, but this one just was outright bad.  While the first two took me a week to read, this one took me over a month due to total lack of interest.  The main characters from the other two books seemed to disappear in this one.  I also did not like the way Katniss seemed to change constantly from one moment to the next.  Just didn't like it...
B00000G3PA|5.0|very good<br />dvd thank you<br />I want one in blue ray thank you<br />you wont be sorry you got this
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book; not as exciting as the first one, but far better than the third. The story is good but the ending sets the third book in the series up to be very different than the first two.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I have always loved the real card game and always wanted to play this on the pc /console since I tried the amazing but short demo for 6th edition on pc.  The developers are very inexperienced and the game crashes on Xbox and kindle fire HD. So very disappointed as a die hard fan. Also, the little I did play - there is no real deck building to be had. Lame.    I don't know why I have given every one of the Magic games a try. I really did want one of them to be worth my money.  I must be insane - but so are the developers.  Do something different, ie. something that works.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Hi I like pie and gold this is fun I hate rats screw scythe Kronos get this phantom Orion  b:d
B00DJW0OBQ|1.0|This is an excellent book.  However, the Amazon Kindle version has so many typos and spacing issues that it is basically impossible to read.  I submitted a complaint that was ignored.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Although this novel is shorter than other Ken Follett books I've read, it still did not disappoint.  Excellent pace of introducing characters and suspense.  The details never get lost or overlooked but are woven into the story with skill.  Historical novels are my favorite genre and Follett never lets me down.  He is a master of his craft.  I would highly recommend &#34;Eye of the Needle&#34; to anyone who enjoys historical novels or suspense.
B004VFK5LO|4.0|A taught crime drama that delves into the psychological territory of serial killers and the profilers who must try to understand their twisted minds in order to catch them.  This film has fine performances and plenty of suspense to keep you on the edge of you seat until the end.  Very well done.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a fun, addictive game with great graphics. I love the look of it on my kindle fire hd and it runs smoothly! Reminds me of Subway Surfer.
0307951154|1.0|A very uninteresting book; although I will admit that perhaps that may be in part because of the translation. While the story is uninteresting, the characters are obnoxious: mostly \\"druggies\\" in Oslo.
B00003CXRM|5.0|MADE US LAUGH AND WE WERE TRULY ENTERTAINED BY ALL THE WONDERFUL ACTORS.<br />CHARLES DURNING WAS MY FAVORITE ESPECIALLY SINCE I ALWAYS ADMIRED HIM.  ALSO ALL OTHERS DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB, GEORGE CLOONEY SURPRISED ME BY BEING A COMEDIAN. MY FRIENDS ARE ALSO ENJOYING THE MOVIE.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I hated the ending, and speed read through a good portion of the book.  Characters were very strange and to me not very sympathetic or compelling in any way.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Perfect trilogy set. I bought this for my boyfriend and he was thrilled. This will be in our collection forever, or at least as long as DVD's are still relevant! Attractive box, inlets & booklets. A truly great trilogy box set for a very reasonable price.
0385340567|5.0|This is the first Jack Reacher book I read and the first book by Lee Child that I have read and I was hooked. I read it a couple more times since and it's still just as good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's my favourite game it's so fun once you get subway surfers you can't stop playing with the game [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B008XKSW7M|5.0|a laugh  minute. It was funny, factional, and really engrossing, it brought back some memories of my pregnancies. I would recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Perfect when traveling.  Love it ..also tells me temperature.  Like it more than my cell phone alarm.  Would recommend to anyone..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing details, the hunger games series is the best I don't regret staying up all night reading it. I love it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|In this novel August Pullman arrives at Beecher Prep undoubtedly to find that the year would turn awesome. But August not only has a good year personally but his friends welcome him in like any other person would. This story revolves around August, His sister Oliva \\"Via\\" Pullman her non-punctuated violinist boyfriend, Justin, August 's friends Miranda, Summer and Jack.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it! Some of the clues, are way out there and you really have to look in random places, but great game!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I want to try this!!!!  Instructions aren't clear.......No idea what to do! Better directions would be helpful. Who can explain it ?
141694737X|5.0|Very simple book, but the little flaps reveal a little animal underneath.  My baby (4 mos) loves this!  Definitely a keeper and regular book we read to her.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|It's just like the free version. Plus, they ask you to but more stuff. And I paid 3.99 for almost nothing new. What a shame
0765365278|5.0|As with most of Sanderson's books his world building abilities are amazing.  The character development is top notch.  I really cared about all of the characters and would continue to read long after I should have been sleeping ;).  This is a hefty book, over 1000 pages but I didn't feel like there was a lot of stupid filler (like too many descriptions of whats for dinner etc). This is definitely not light reading.  Anxiously awaiting book 2.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|I Have To Say This May Be The Worst Album I've Ever Heard. I'm Ashamed Of Ozzy. The Last Album He Had Was Amazing Then He Got Together With Black Sabbath Again (Which I Thought It Was Cool) But Then They Released This Big Turd. I Wouldn't Even Get If A Full 1 Star. Maybe Half. Don't Waste Your Money Like I Wasted Mine. Stay Away From This And Stick With The Classics.
B007SGM084|2.0|This is a soft to moderate porn book which I put down after several hundred pages.  It keeps repeating the same things and is really not interesting.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The ending of this story makes the heart sing!  Well written and easy to follow(once you catch on to the dialect)this Irish tale of love lost and found is worth the time.  It is a great summer read!
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|The initial set I received had a defect on Disc One/Episode 5.  The seller promptly sent a new set; unfortunately, this set also seems to have the same defect.  I am trying to see if any of the other episodes have problems.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really fun its not to hard and not easy at the same time.its a great way to spend time.get it!
B0040GURF8|4.0|The majority of the CD is expectation. What distracts from being outstanding is Meyer's inability to acknowledge  that just because its a live recording people don't want to hear the talking and the crowd sing alongs that occur at concerts.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I read Infernal Devices trilogy first, and Clare's writing in that series is much more vibrant and compelling. This book is good, but it doesn't really reach the depth of the other series in terms of characters and emotional connection. Still worth reading the rest of the series.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|West trys so hard to be NEW and fresh that he actual sounds common and used. Perhaps lot less West and a lot more music will help greatly.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Great video of the most amazing guitarist , A remarkable show worth viewing over and over and sharing with my friends
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Thought was ok...what you see in the 1 room is basically what all the rooms look like with a slight variation such as an additional room and different objects/puzzles to work through before the door opens.<br /><br />I guess I just prefer the more interactive games with moving graphics &amp; a story so this was a little boring for me personally but I can see why others may like it.
B00CM9JL4S|5.0|I think this album is getting a lot of flack because of a role reversal: All Is One  is more of a Middle Eastern/ Yeminite rock album than a Metal\prog album with middle eastern influences. i think its exceptional. Yemenite themes ooze throughout this album. My only complaint: where's the Yeminite vocalist?? I've barely heard her throughout this album.<br /><br />every single track is unique and wonderful. never outlasting their length like ORwarriOr or the unnecessary overproduction (like Sapari's random phone disconnect and other outofplace sound effects).. No where near as epic as Mabool, and nothing like their first two albums. I love Orphaned Land's work before OrWarrior, but I also dont want Mabool part deux. Im not sure they could ever recreate the sheer epicness of Mabool, like Opeth's Blackwater Park or Isis Panopticon or Porcupine Tree's Blackest Eyes or Led Zeppelin's Physical Grafitti or the countless examples of bands hitting their peak. It's their magnum opus and can probably never be replicated. Best not to try and instead keep experimenting and head to new material.
B00BR476TG|4.0|I watched the full length movie as a rental and also on a plane ride to Vegas and still really enjoyed it very much.
B000U1ZV8K|2.0|i ordered this new was super stoked when it arrived and decided to go ahead and watch them all with a couple friends, part 1 great. part 2 DIDNT WORK AT ALL! I tried playing it in a dvd player, an xbox 360, and a playstation 3, the disc was acting like there was no data on it at all. part 3 great part 4 had some scratches on it on even though it was brand new and sometimes dvd player skips at some scenes, i mean 3 movies was still a good deal but i was pretty heated that day and now i have to order lethal weapon 2 separetly :(
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I was waiting for this day to come, the humanized MLP characters, and I am going to say this, I'm from the generation of Firefly, Twilight (Pink and silver), original Apple Jack, and so forth. I'm pretty much still the old school MLP fan. Still am too and pretty proud of it.<br /><br />If you're a mother you need to take your daughters to it, if you're an old school MLP fan, you need to see it! This is actually a great movie and has that old school feel. The music is catchy and you can get some fun out of it. The characters are endearing and I would if I have kids show this to them.<br /><br />The plot was actually surprising, the characters live up to what to expect. This is good writing and I would say, I hope that Hasbro brings more to the screen. I haven't had this much fun in years, and I loved the music!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Matthew Quick's portrayal of emotionally ill people was cartoonish. Very little of this book is even worth the effort. I'm sorry I wasted the time.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|This film is a classic zombie adventure. It is not up to Romero's masterpieces but it certainly is entertaining and the effects are good. The zombies run instead of walk (NO!) but it was much better than I was expecting.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Queensryche are back! Great chemistry going on with this lineup... no more strangehold, or \\"do what your told\\".... and they rise to the top once again!
B00CL0J99K|3.0|'How do you rate this item?' That's the first question asked by amazon's 'create your review' page.When I tried to make this post I received a message:'Please rate this item'...Item(so in order for me to post I gave \\"the move\\"3 stars). How or maybe a better question why are all you...let's be kind and call you 'premature evaluater's', can write a 'review of a product' that you have never seen,held,or played on your dvd/blu-ray players Sure I know you've seen the movie... so have I. But I'm not about to evaluate a product I know very little if anything about. If you want to write a review about 'Iron Man 3/3d' movie go to Imdb or rotten tomatoes or alternate site of your choosing. This 'is not' the forum people.
B000002UJQ|3.0|This group is what I would say is in the AAA league not in the Majors.  The music is good, but not that good.  I'm sure that I have upset their hard core fans, but that's my opinion.  Sorry.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Dumb ending. Katniss is so stupid. Not enough explanation for secretive plot happenings that don't make sense. Done skins oaks hey
B00064MW6K|1.0|This movie just wasn't worth watching. It was ridiculous and not even in a good way. It's a shame that a decent Catwoman story wasn't told.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|This really works great!  I can finally convert all my tapes to MP3 and listen to them whenever I want!
0316227706|5.0|amazing pictures of swimming dogs, You can't go wrong with buying this book.  The dogs look so great, good book to have out on the table when company comes over!
B000JLPMPS|5.0|You can always count on Clint Eastwood for a good movie.  They are all very entertaining.  I never mind seeing them over and over again.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Great stuff Good story line I found this very enjoyable, I would recommend this movie for  a great present for anyone.
1476715904|5.0|Loved the story, characters, and poetry. A book that will have you laughing out loud one minute and crying the next. I want to say it's one of my favorites I have read this year, but that would be only half true. It is one of my all time favorites.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I like this good colors. Good story line I found this very enjoyable, I would recommend this movie for. a great present for anyone.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|i went blank trough a whole night i just couldn't put it down. even when i became all emotional about it
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Good shoot em up movie...Good story line I found this very enjoyable, I would recommend this movie for family viewing. a great present for anyone.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|This is well done just as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy but it brings nothing new. It tells the story in a long drwan out fashion in order to make additional movies,  If it was told in the tight fast moving style of Lord of the Rings, the fact that nothing new in terms of movie elements, technology and special effects would be over looked. It was poor story telling just to make more movies. Yes, it was well done and while i lliked it, I was very disappointed.
B00BEYYEE4|4.0|Very good attention getter. Good story line I found this very enjoyable, I would recommend this movie . a great present for anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|amazing!! very few tablet games this good.<br />addictive kind of clue esque type game once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down!!
B0072OFM28|5.0|Good stuff here. Good story line I found this very enjoyable, I would recommend this movie for a great present for anyone.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Enjoyed the series very much. Ive always thought the writers did excellant work with these stories, even good for the kids
B00406UK7S|5.0|Good story line I found this very enjoyable, I would recommend this movie for family viewing. a great present for anyone.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|I am plodding through this and it's mostly because of the stilted language after reading so many American English books.  It's a classic though and I will finish it one day.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|hard to figure out what is going on. When it going colors though. A treat for kids  I would not pay to see
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game! Challenging but not overly difficult. fun to play and has kept my attention.  glad I found this game!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game that does not require you to pay real money to play.  Very entertaining on a rainy day.
B009APMNB0|5.0|This a great if you are looking solely for a quick and easy way to calibrate your monitor.  It creates the profile and loads it for immediate use.<br />It would help if the documentation gave you the path to find where the profile name is located.<br />The price is very reasonable,
B000W93CHC|5.0|Following on Fall of Giants this is a great continuation of the characters.  It is amazing how Follett weaves the lives of this diverse groups from very different social and national backgrounds.  Can't wait for volume 3!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played I highly recommend this game for people with imagination you can do anything to top it off it gets better and better because it's updates are awesome in other words best game ever!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Lots of fun.  Challenges your mind and reflexes.  Spent many hours being challenged.  Great for ages.  I know if you try it you will like it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|No plot in the 3rd novel....kept waiting for the moment.  Of course I will read the 4th one, but very weak.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is like having my own horse it is great I love this game my horses name.o  babe I couldn't decide between babe and whirlpool so i chose.babe
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best because it pushes u 2 ur limit and I 4 once think its awesome and whoever owns 1 should no how it feels .....AWESOME!!!!!!!<br /><br />I recommend u should own 1!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game&hellip;is amazing!!!! It's not my favorite game but one of the best games I have ever played. I am a big pocket edition player and I wanted to tell u how great this game is&hellip; and I love butter!!!
B009X01C64|5.0|This is a nice quality leather case.  It allows the Kindle Fire to rotate in a complete circle.  It has horizontal and vertical settings.  The Kindle goes off automatically when you close the case.  There's a strap to insert your hand to hold up the Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Everything a sequel should be and SO much more...Breath taking at every corner. I can't wait to see the movie. Although the book is always 5 times more edgy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've been using this to sleep, and it seems to be working well. I haven't tried any of the &quot;noise&quot; options, but have liked the storm type sounds so far.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Reminiscent of the old Sam Peckinpah shoot-em-ups with a fair amount of flying blood.  Not for the squeamish, but a great story that's well-crafted and has just the right amount of kitsch.  Loved it!
B001KX50BK|5.0|Even men will like this one.  A modern day Cinderella type story.  Great cast.  The BluRay version is very clear and crisp in terms of video and audio
B00CH87HF4|4.0|UPDATE: I've placed for several days and even bit the bullet and payed $10 to see if it was worth it.<br />CONCLUSION: the pay option screws up game balance. I understand the need to have a viable business model in today world and all those cool graphics don't get done for free. BUT unless you are autistic, there is just no way replaying the same level 400+ times is going to be fun. They need to add some way to earn healing potions and gems inside the game. AND after speaking to several friends the healing icons are damn rare! On the plus side the multi-player maps have a lot of re-playability.<br /><br />oh, and it crashes about 1 ever hour or two of continuous play so even if you replay the level you hit a limit, sigh.......<br /><br />TWO WORDS to the game designer: GAME BALANCE!!!!<br /><br />original review:<br />I agree with the other reviewers that although a beautiful game, the payment for gems (both cost and utility) negatively affects the balance of the game play. They should either make the gems cheaper or better yet, make them more earn able within the game.
B000002KOO|4.0|Before the glitz and glamour of Buckingham/Nicks, this was a blues-based band.  The one thing I wish was one this CD was a separate version of &#34;Oh Wekk&#34; -- with only Part 1.  Such is life
1781162646|4.0|I admire King's storytelling and writing style - his characters are vivid and compelling and the syntax of his capturing 1973 is \\"right on!\\" Other than the cringeworthy, foreshadowed and derivative \\"Summer of '42\\" sex scene and rather abrupt ending, I liked this book a great deal.
B00081912E|5.0|came as promised we watch it all of the TIME.....FUNNY MOVIE AND MY GRANDBABY LOVES IT .ONE OF OUR FAVORITES MOVIES
B00CCEHR80|5.0|This set from August 5, 1990, at the Greek Theatre, Berkeley features an excellent, energetic performance from the JGB.  Sound quality is likewise excellent-crisp and clear, especially with headphones (this is based on listening to the CDs, not mp3s).  There is something special about this show.  One thing that struck me is that even some of the \\"standards\\" that often appear in JGB setlists and on releases are stand-outs here.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found it to be a challenge.  It really gets your brain working. Sometimes driving me a little crazy. I would definitely. reccomind this game to any one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome you should get it why are you reading when you should be playing so come on get this app
B000004286|5.0|London Symphony Orchestra.  Sweeping gorgeous music.  I work to it sleep to it.  Play it when I am jangled or down.  Highly recommend.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this. app is awsome you should get it so. what are you waiting for go get it why are you reading when you should be playing
B00785P2QC|4.0|A fun game. Great game too pass time with. realistic. I recommend. game to any body and every body. like it a lot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic, addictive game with no hints. Finished the game in one sitting and can't wait for more levels. Loved it!
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Didn't get to go, so got the next best thing.  Trying to get my family involved in viewing it, not much luck there, but the dogs love it when we have a dancing party in the living room!!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I've been stuck on level 99 for quite a while now dispite tipping my neighbors and many others in the community and buying a lot of items with gems and money. I am getting very frustrated with this game ... VERY !!
B008PNBU30|4.0|I bought this for 2 songs but the whole CD is great. Just as good if not better than previous CDs
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is one of the best games we have played in a long time! We enjoy getting to evolve and make friends as we go...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The first few levels are easy but kept me entertained.  One level stumped me for a little while. It's fun tapping around the rooms,  figuring out the clues and finding the keys to the elevator. I am glad I found this game and I look forward to more levels.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|So I bought this and put it in my computer with a Corsair h80 liquid coolant system and it's running fine. Not much of a tech expert but I'm assuming that's all you can really ask for with a processor. You can look up technical details anywhere else, so I won't go into that.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This sequel does a great job with character development but I still have the same issues as the first book.  It is much longer than it needs to be and could use a good editor.  Also, unlike the first book which could stand on its own - this one leaves you hanging on to see what happens in book 3.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have to agree with other readers. Although I love Yve story of Gideon and Eva, I feel that it is time to end the story.. All they do is have sex!! There was no plot to this story whatsoever.. I don't think I will be buying the next one either!!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|This book didn't feel as developed as the first 2 in the series.  It is still worth a read but I don't think I would have read another book in this series as had been planned.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|It was a good story with lots of unexpected turns. I'm not really a romance movie fan, but I really enjoyed this movie and would  highly recommend it to everyone
0375842209|1.0|I really wanted to love this book because I value the importance of reading.  However, I read more than half this book and just couldn't bring myself to finish it.  The pace of the story was slow and there are definitely much better books that give you a glimpse of the Nazi era.  I just finished Erik Larson's In The Garden of Beasts which I'd highly recommend if you want a good informative read about the period leading up to World War II.  I have to agree with the young adult classification of this book.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Not exactly what I expected, however it was  a good movie. I liked how the Oz character was portrayed. On a 1-10 scale I would rate it as an 8
B0015DROBO|4.0|I found this to be a good book overall but I think it was much longer than it needed to be - there were so many details that had nothing to do with the story.  This could have easily been a shorter and better book.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|Lots of action, quirky romance, and humor with a stellar cast of characters.  There are even lovable villains.  I'm really looking forward to the sequel!
0439023521|5.0|For a young adult book, I found this book to be a surprising page turner.  I read this book before seeing the movie (which I found disappointing).  Quick read and a refreshingly new story concept.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so much more than just building a zoo. You can go on quests to find and rescue sick or wounded animals in the wild, help them heal at your zoo, then release them back into the wild. I love that you can explore different biomes and even go back in time to rescue dinosaurs!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was fascinating yet heart-breaking at the same time.  It presents a fair view of the ethics raised by the many issues around cell research.  What an amazing gift Henrietta Lacks and her family contributed to the world.  This book was both educational and a page turner.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love anything having to do with creepy carnivals or amusement parks.  The graphics were great and game play was perfect...not too hard,  not too easy.  I have only played the free version but will probably buy it to play the rest.
0545586178|4.0|This was a surprisingly good follow-up to the first book.  The second hunger games was a great twist.  This book does a good job of developing the characters further.  This is a quick easy read.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I bought this album as well as Saturdays = Youth and am not sure which one I like more. While this album is 2-discs with more songs, Saturdays = Youth has &#34;We Own the Sky&#34; (in my top 2 songs for M83), &#34;Up!&#34;, and &#34;Coleurs&#34;. The albums are very different, so they're hard to compare. Can't go wrong with either.
0439023513|3.0|While still a good book, I found this book's concept to be less developed.  As another reader said, the ending seemed rushed but somewhat predictable.
B00151HZME|5.0|If you haven't listened to them before GO HAVE A LISTEN. This band has become one of my favorites. I'm always in the mood to listen to their unique sound. If you like any of their songs, buy this cd!
0316017922|5.0|This book is AWESOME.  I read it over one day, immediately connected to the material.  It matches many of things I think about
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Big Kanye fan, but this is clearly his most disappointing piece of work to date...by far.  Yeezus, seriously?!  The album seems more about Kanye than about the music.
0316172324|5.0|This book is AWESOME.  I read it over two days, immediately connected to the material.  It matches many of things I think about
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Did not know what to expect.....and truly enjoyed it!  All the actors did an outstanding job. Highly recommend to watch.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters and loved it even tho it was a little strange but overall I loved it and it's worth the money
B0026IWNZ4|4.0|There are still some parts that are inappropriate for young children.  Stupid, butt head, idiot...are just a few words they could have left out.  And did they REALLY need to end Maude's life that way?  It's suppose to be rated G.
B003U4UNUU|2.0|I finally watched \\"Lost\\" on amazon prime three years after the series ended. Thank you for small favors. I watched it in four weeks - If I would have watched this series over a period of six years for that joke of an ending......WHAT! Big let down guys!  Although up to season four - I was completely hypnotized. Sawyer & Kate were the best love story. Juliet really. I think not! LOL. Do better next time.
055358894X|5.0|This book takes a little while to establish itself.  It is a bit heavy on the exposition, but once it gets going, it hooks onto you and doesn't let go!  I am a huge fan of The Name of the Wind, and this book is the next best thing!  It's intelligent,original, well written, funny in a smart assed Aaron Sorkin way, and full of twists.  I can't wait for the rest of the series!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|This game is so much fun. Once i started playing it. It was hard to stop. Samurai vs zombies has cool graphics. A good amount of upgrades. And hours  of fun for people of all ages.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The author's writing style and pace keep those pages turning with well developed characters you really care about and a twisting, turning plot.  It has a satisfying ending,  but leaving you wanting more from this author.  My only disappointment being that this is her only book and I must wait until November 2013 for another one.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of this work is the WhiperSync for voice companion audio.  The two narrators really bring the book to life with their beautiful yet easy to understand accents.  This is my favorite feature on the new Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I would very highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mysteries.
159463176X|5.0|My friend, If YOU liked the \\"KITE RUNNER \\" .YOU WILL LOVE AND THE MOUTAINS ECHOED.I DON'T KNOW HOW THE BRAIN OF THIS MAN WORKS. IS HE REALLY EXPERIENCING WHAT HE WRITES ABOUT?
074401493X|4.0|This guide is great and the keychain that comes with it seems to be very sturdy and well made. The maps at the beginning of each chapter are nicely detailed and relatively easy to determine where on the map your character is. All of the information about hidden collectables/parts/supplements is easy to find in the guide. The collectable info has its own section at the end of the guide that you can easily flip to if you're playing through and just want to make sure that you grab everything as you go. The collectable info is also shown in their respective sections in the guide and, usually, they're easy to make sure you grab as you follow along.<br /><br />Notice that I said \\"usually.\\" Because of the way the guide is organized, instead of saying \\"walk through the door on the left, grab some parts from the office and Artifact #15 from the desk,\\" the guide says \\"walk through the door on the left and grab some parts from the office\\" and then an inset says \\"Artifact #15: Roland's Fence Plan\\" with details on where to find it. For the most part, this is fine, the artifact's inset catches your eye and you don't miss it. But, I have had more than one occasion where I will be following along with the guide and the guide says \\"go through the door and listen to the conversation.\\" I go through the door, the door closes behind me, the characters talk, I turn the page in the guide and see \\"Artifact 32: Something About Survival: 'before you go through the door, make sure you grab this artifact from underneath the table.'\\" At this point, I need to go back to whenever I manually saved the game last (because, of course, it autosaved when I walked through that door) and work my way through in order to get one piece of paper.<br /><br />So, as I said, the guide is very detailed and a great resource, but if you're trying to collect every single thing on your play through, make sure you either save very often , under multiple save files, or read a whole page ahead in the guide before you go through any door.
030758836X|5.0|I don't know what whent trough the mind of this woman . Just to keep a man that doesn't even love her. Lied to her parents, commit murder in the name of what? just to be call the perfect spouse? It's mind blowing,the more you read the more you want to keep on reading just to find out what happened. It's a thriller mind blower,. No wonder it has been on the top best sellers for so many weeks.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait for the 4th book now! By far my favorite series!!  A hot and steamy love story like no other! I've read it 3 times in 2 weeks!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I enjoy trying to find all the pieces needed to help me escape. I do wish there were more levels to complete before it tells me I mastered it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|killer effects and cast madee a great movie. perfeect pick for the cast and hats off for the digital team
0345529057|5.0|Can't put the books down. Finished them in record time. Awaiting book 5 in the mail. The 4 book set id a great value.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lots of options and even has an audio version! Easy to use and personalize for your own convenience. Great for Bible studies.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|It's fun, but simplistic and narrow. Don't confuse Duels of the Planeswalker with real magic. But as a cheap alternative to MtgO, it works.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Not usre why I am even writing this review because anything that needs to be said has already been done. I was an instructor in video and movie making at one time. This movie is an outstanding example of the craft at its best. Much room for discussion on many levels.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|awesome game totally worth buying and I like the idea of feeding two on noms if you haven't gotten this yet GET IT!!!!!!!!
030759565X|5.0|My step daughter shared this cookbook with me. I enjoyed it so much i bought one for myself and one for my own daughter. I especially like the side notes and the step by step pictures. This will become my new bridal shower gift for friends and family.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Really fun game and entertaining. Really easy to follow instructions. Which it would give you a little more time or give you different challenges.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Perhaps the most difficult and at times the most tedious book I have ever read but nevertheless absolutely worth every minute! At heart a comment on the human condition which is still entirely relevant today. Hugo shows that after 250 years we are still struggling with the same basic societal challenges and have honestly made little progress towards adequate solutions.
B008LXZFH6|2.0|I am sure the new one will be full of vulgarity and sexual talk... Will certainly not see it, won't waste my time....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Gorgeous graphics. Fun mini games. I started playing this to build up some coins for my daughter and found myself addicted! She &amp; I both LOVE it!
B001K3EXTA|3.0|Not sure why didn't, just got tied up with other stuff and could not keep my attention at all.  So just middle of the road.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Best show ever in my opinion. I cannot wait till season 3 comes out! Every episode pulls you in with a new twist and exciting addition to the show.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have always had trouble waking up to all of my alarm clocks, this alarm has different snooze options such as, shaking the Kindle for a set number of seconds or solving math problems. I think this app is genius. I have had no problems with it not going off either.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish there were more instructions. Fun and different for me but I am not a big game junkie.  Prefer mind games.
1480521086|1.0|This author has become greedy for money and doesn't understand the word trilogy. Readers have Waited months for a conclusion to this series and instead were given a book to read once again with no ending. This book has the same sex scene over and over again with no depth and No answers to Gideon's past. She did give a brief two sentences trying to explain it and than had him cry with Eva's finger in his butt during sex with no answers as to why. She simply published this book to make money, truly a disgrace. I am happy to say she will not make anymore money off of me.

B005LAIIKI|2.0|Note:  My original review is below, but I re-rated my opinion to two stars from four as this was such an irresponsible movie that denies the truth Sergio Leone found in the Old West and the Civil War and totally is unbelievable from a standpoint on the truth of history.  It is NOT the Best Original Screenplay.  It is another Quentin Tarantino \\"pastiche\\" to other people's works as it makes Peter Bogdanovich's \\"pastiches\\" look like the real thing.  To allow people to think for one minute that blacks were treated as such during slavery is to deny their true triumph over the injustices of racism.  Who needs someone spending millions of dollars to turn out irresponsible unbelievable self-indulgences (like the acting in this film)?<br /><br />Review:  Quentin Tarantino's latest epic \\"Django Unchained,\\" called a \\"revisionist Western about slavery\\" suffers from the same delusions as his \\"revisionist World War II film about the Nazis\\" that offered Brad Pitt's least capable performance (I am sure his AAN for BSActor for \\"12 Monkeys\\" was because there was a shortage of good performances that year and his penance for playing someone mentally challenged so simply is he should watch Robert DeNiro in \\"Aawkenings\\" 20 times).  \\"Django Unchained\\" and \\"Inglorious Basterds\\"\\" have nothing to do with history.  It's all a rip-off.  \\"Django Unchained\\" rips off the title character from a spaghetti western and where Sergio Leone used caution in depicting the ravages of the Civil War in \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\\" Tarantino, when presented the Old South and slavery before the War, presents a spectacle that those poor impoverished creatures, including the plantation owners, would never see.  Costumes, fabrics, set pieces, and many other natural historical inaccuracies are given the modern day sensibilities that are strictly for fantasists and anyone curious about slavery ought to see \\"Mandingo\\" more so as it was on planet earth.  Christopher Waltz takes away acting honors from both films (\\"Django Unchained\\"\\" and \\"Inglorious Basterds\\") which is a measure of how good he is as an actor, not that these were anything but \\"characters\\" in largely entertaining movies, whose faults at anything serious, should send Tarantino back to his blueprint for the wildly successful, but more sensibly set \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"(\\"Django Unchained\\"\\" and \\"Inglorious Basterds\\") which is a measure of how good he is as an actor, not that these were anything but \\"characters\\" in largely entertaining movies, whose faults at anything serious, should send Tarantino back to his blueprint for the wildly successful, but more sensibly set \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"
0449808696|4.0|If you eat processed foods of any kind you need to read this book or at the very least do your own research into these &#34;food giant&#34; companies which manufacture so much of what America is putting in their mouths. Michael Moss does a great job of culling vast amounts of industry research and breaking it all down into a useful and informative format. The bottom line is this, food manufacturer's number one concern is their bottom line. As time goes on, and driven by the insatiable demands of Wall Street (with perhaps the exception of privately owned giant, Cargill), they need to sell more and more of their product. This is bad news for our health and well being. Through three separate sections entitled salt, sugar, and fat, Moss attempts to educate us in taking the responsibility for our own well being and that of our children. The book offers an exhaustive background and history into the manufacturing of convenience &#34;foods&#34; and the insidious marketing ploys used to sell these products. Interviews with past industry insiders round out a bleak look as to what goes on behind the scenes at some of these most iconic American companies. Well rounded, thorough, and insightful if not at times a bit scattered with the interspersing of company history with today's relevant facts, Moss's rallying cry for Americans is to take responsibilty for their own health, learn to read and decipher food lables and shop mindfully.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|Im taking word from my friend.  She says it is not challenging and you basically don't  do anything. I should know because I play it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers so much and I swear I am addicted to it but its ok I love you subway suffers stay awesome!!!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Very good action movie and I think that even though he is obviously shorter than the fictional loner, he did a fine job and was very believable.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Although Arnie is showing his age, he still has presence and this movie hung together well.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes action films.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Just as expected, Dexter Season 7 was awesome!  I'm going to really miss him after the current season which will be his last.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game so much I can't put the game down. My kids had to get it on their devices they love it too.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Front line Commando D day is an awesome game. I feel like I am playing medal of honor or band of brothers on tablet format. You have clean streaming graphics. HD look. And a realistic view on the wars history and weapons we used. Worth trying I hope this helps. Enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best games ever the world tour is awesome when the world tour is over it should be a part two.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Beast fun game I can't stop playing so play or don't it is the best<br />In the world play right now download it give five stars
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Easy learning curve, fun way depicting the story of Moses and the flood. My 6 year old granddaughter loved it as well.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|After all these years, still a great spectacle, great acting, and a gripping story about the folly and futility of war.
B00CSSRPGY|5.0|Eliane is just a joy to listen to. A hint if Astrud Gilberto in her voice, but also so much more in her talent. I still love Astrud but she had to move over slightly for Eliane......
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This may be Grisham's worst book. At the end he even confesses to having done almost no background work on it. The characters are weak and there is little dialog. His main character is African American for no reason related to the plot, and the plot is disorganized.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved the game which it were cheaper though. After I paid I wished it would have lasted. Always enjoy their games.
B005PK57NU|5.0|very clever writing.  great way to view the human experience.  moving, challenging - probably would be termed equivelent to a 'chick flick' by outward appearances, but much deeper significance and definitely a product of and for our times.  nps  ps / and having the first 4 seasons offered by amazon prime is truly amazoning!
B009AMANBA|4.0|An awfully good movie distinguished by exceptionally good acting led by Daniel Day Lewis' justly praised performance as Lincoln.  Several other performances are compelling, notably Sally Field as Mary Lincoln, David Staitharn as the shrewd and urbane William Seward, and Tommy Lee Jones, whose tendency to chew scenery is used to very good effect in his depiction of the admirable Thaddeus Stevens.  More than anything else, this is a movie about Washington politics.  Day Lewis portrays Lincoln as an accomplished practical politician pursuing transcendent moral ends, willing to do anything short of outright bribery to secure passage of the 13th Amendment.  In addition to the high level of acting, this movie is distinguished by considerable attention to historical detail and a number of superb scences featuring Spielberg's considerable talents as a director.  The movie climaxes with the roll call vote for the 13th Amendment; a powerful and suspenseful setpiece capped by a chorus of the great Unionist song, Battle Cry of Freedom.<br /><br />While this movie certainly shows the tremendous racism of the period, it doesn't give a good sense of why even the conservative wing of the Republican party, and by extension, a significant majority of voters in the Northern states, were willing to abolish, as opposed to contain, slavery.  The latter was the pre-war default position of the Republicans.  These men were quite conscious of the USA's status as a republican-democratic experiment in a world dominated by monarchies and autocracies.  Over the course of the Civil War, many in the North concluded that only the extirpation of slavery would safeguard the Republic and were willing to tolerate a world with many, many free African-Americans.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I read this one years ago, for the first time. I bought it again to re-read on my kindle. Between the first read and the second read, I must have changed... because I remember the first time, being underwhelmed... but this time? I absolutely loved it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Overall the bag is great and it fits everything I need it to. I started to collect far too much equipment for the small bag that I had already so I needed something a bit larger and this is just what I needed. As soon as I got the bag I waterproofed it before using it and it has held up pretty good so far. The only issue that I have with it is that it is beginning to fray already around the corners but so far its just minor fraying most likely caused by my unusually active use of the bag itself, I use it every day.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hoover writes for young adults,  I'm 57 (not young) but her characters are well developed, the story line is good, Full of the adolescent &#34;Drama Rama&#34; young people's lives are full of :D  I find her Novels interesting because She writes from the girls perspective in one book, and from the guys character in the next.  ( I pre -ordered &#34;Loosing Hope&#34; ,it's from the guys point of view). Her first 2 books:  &#34;Slammed&#34; and &#34;Point of Retreat&#34;.  were written in the same female/male perspective.  While each novel can stand alone,  I recommend getting both for a fuller understanding of her characters!
B000NY12LO|4.0|Very realistic and scary.  Subject matter provided incite into our children today.  Life is very tough and this book portrayed the this very well.
B007SGM084|1.0|A friend recommended it, I bought it, I want my friend to get counceling!  After about 30 pages all I want to know is HOW TO GET IT OFF MY MIND AND MY KINDLE.  If you're into S and M or just want to know about it read this
1118488768|5.0|The whole idea inside this book is summed up nicely by Robert Scoble inside the book...<br /><br />\\"You're not supposed to be able to do what David says you're going to inside this book.\\"<br /><br />What I like most about, and have always liked most about this book is David points to actual, documented examples of companies and their results with \\"new media.\\"  Some good, some bad.<br /><br />Not only do you get the benefit of learning from these examples, but they back up David's points well.  In addition, David \\"walks the walk\\" in media himself... for his own business as a trainer, speaker, and writer online.  He produces video using a $250 video recorder, and writes solid content on his own blog, helping him to build a solid practice.<br /><br />So, with this \\"tome\\" (closing in on 400 pages), you'll get it all... and I highly recommend this book if you're just starting out with social media, or if you're an executive of a Fortune 500 company.<br /><br />Actually, ESPECIALLY if you're an example of a Fortune 500, we need more bigger companies adhering to the practices within this book, so David can quit pulling examples of how \\"NOT\\" to do things from your ranks. ;)
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game rocks.It's like a portable version of battle field.you've got a tank a jeep and a frigging helicopter!!plus all the great experiences when playing this awesome fps.Excellent graphics and and a great weapons selection.The art style is really similar to team fortress 2,and what's better is its free!!<br />_
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Perfect game for a short wait! Can easily complete a few levels in one sitting.. Challenging but not impossible to win..
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Despite the size, these headphones aren't too heavy and are comfortable to wear. Good quality sound and it continues to last years after buying.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Most enjoyable read.  Good characters and plot.  There are quite a few characters to keep track of, which makes it a bit of a challenge.
076535618X|2.0|John Scalzi's Old Man's War remains the best in the series. The Ghost Brigades sequel wasn't as compelling but it at least showed you another perspective of a supporting character of the first book. This book doesn't really grow the characters at all nor advance the world's plot further despite being a true sequel.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|good way to keep in touch with friends and relatives across the country!  Some people put too much personal  on their posts!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini does it again for the third time.  His books shine a light on the Afghan culture while engaging the reader with such well-developed and interesting characters.  Loved it!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|this game was complicated ... there was no instructions on how to play... i do not recommend this game at all
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Latest didn't disappoint.  A subtle and brilliant commentary on the way bureaucracies work.  Looking forward to the next Le Carre book.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Disappointed in the story here. Acting seemed very cheesy. Was painful to finish. Too bad I was looking forward to it.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|i read the first book and was hooked! i want on kindle e-books asap! I want to see what happens to Richard and Kahlan!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|The game is crashing every time I open it and log in. I can't even report it to the creators so I have to write it in a review. I'm not saying the game is bad, it's just the crashes. I'm not going to be like the others and put 4 stars but I just wanted to let someone know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a fun game. I wish in the next update there was villager spawn eggs so I wouldn't be lonely in creative. I wish it was more like Pc version
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|This book and topic are an interesting quick skim-read.  It is interesting because of some of the author's non mainstream business building.  It is somewhat shallow, self serving, and lacking applicable content.  It is populated with numerous life examples from the author's whiplash ups and downs.  Lots of us wait too long in life to &#34;do what we really want to do&#34;.  It's better to learn this lesson early, which point the author makes excellently.
B004QX07G4|5.0|she make me laugh all the way  ,it is so true nobody will think to make this sound so funny
B00722Y1EK|1.0|I didn't even get a pro or a registered just supporting dev but got absolutely nothing. Still sends me to the buy it page. Maybe I should buy it again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story was compelling and made it difficult to put the book down and go to bed at night.  I really felt like I was reading a story written by the father.
0739316478|5.0|I have listened to this CD so many times I've lost count.  I think the storyteller is awesome.  I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app was so much fun. very intertaining and entergetic. I would give this app a high five. and good for kids too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show.  I am amazed at the scenery and clothing.  I love that it is free for Prime members.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game. I dont typically reveiw but i felt tjis game was worth my time. Takes time to get good at it- yet remains challenging.  I look forward to playing at the end of the day as a way to wind down.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This si every bit as good as their self-titled and is right in line with Black Gives way...so if your wondering if it doesnt sound or FEEL like AIC,well never fear.Cantrell has got this handled.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|My third purchase of these 'phones over the years, my favorite all around headphones and great for travel. Excellent sound quality  - deep, solid bass (not boomy), good mids and sweet highs. I have more expensive 'phones that do some things better, but for the $ these are outstanding. Like most Sony 'phones, these will outlive their pads but they can be replaced. Light weight and comfortable, performance close to higher end products.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love it and I want to watch it again and again. Beautiful scene, amazing story, great act, if you didn't watch it, just play it now ;)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is really a cool game to play<br />I want to tell you that you should play the game
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I read book first. The movie wasn't attractive compare with the book. I was disappointed when I watched the movie.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|My title says it all. There's nothing I can add that the other reviews haven't covered. The Good Wife is good to watch on a rainy day, although predictable at times it held my interest. Characters like Eli Gold, Kalinda and Carey are what set this show above similar fare on television.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|Well, I thought I had already reviewed and posted on this item.  But, anyhow, here again are my comments.  I have this program installed and use it for my Kindle Fire HD and it seems to be working OK.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Lately, it’s become fashionable among book reviewers to dismiss Le Carre’s recent novels with terms like “second-rate,”  “heavy-handed”, and “the work of a once-good writer who has lost his touch.” Don’t believe any of this nonsense! Le Carre is more than a good writer of spy thrillers: he remains a major novelist who knows how to draw wonderful, fully-dimensional characters while telling a suspenseful story, and most important, while asking probing questions about the state of Western culture. “A Delicate Truth” is a novel very much worth reading. I’ll grant that this new book might rank a step or two below Le Carre’s superb George Smiley trilogy or his “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,” but it remains within that honorable tradition of novels which offer critical examinations of our civilization—books by writers among whom I’d include Conrad, Orwell, Huxley, and most recently, Cormack McCarthy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I need more rooms to complete it was very entertaining and problem solving. My daughter also wants to play more rooms please update asap
B005PK57IK|5.0|I never knew what I was missing.  Well written and the characters are multi-layered and interesting.  I highly recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it can't wait for the next one,hopefully we will not have to wait for the next book as long as we did this one
B0039OC64M|1.0|Boring uninteresting just did hold my attention I just would no recommend this movie. No story line yea you get the point big brother is watching but that's it but you know this when before you watch it that is what the movie is about
B0081336FO|5.0|We can't wait for season 3!  My husband and I are completely addicted to this series.  Thank you Amazon for adding it to your Prime list.

B004TMPJP6|5.0|I've been using it for a couple of years, and I don't think I would have SURVIVED that time period without it.

They include TODAY--for things I must accomplish before the day is over, to THIS WEEK, the purpose of which is obvious.<br /><br />They also include RESEARCH TO DO, and this is where I paste all the links that I don't have time to visit now, but don't want to miss altogether.  It also includes things that pop into my mind, like a song from the 60's, that I can't stop and listen to right now, but will when I have a little &#34;play time.&#34;<br /><br />There are two lists for WRITING:  One specific to a book I am planning, and the other just for ideas of thing I MIGHT like to write about someday.<br /><br />There is a list of great QUOTATIONS I hear and don't want to &#34;lose,&#34; and a list of HOUSEHOLD TIPS I may actually get off my behind and try some day,<br /><br />There is a WISHLIST (which is kind of a bucket list) and a HOUSE WISHLIST that contains all the things that I would like to do to improve my house if I ever have &#34;two nickles to rub together.&#34;<br /><br />There is a list of PROJECTS I hope to find the money and energy to attempt eventually.<br /><br />I could go on and on--and HAVE, obviously, but I don't think Wunderlist can be beat.  I have tried various computer to do list programs--one I even PAID for--and I haven't found anything that comes close.<br /><br />It is easy to use--setting up a new list takes about 30 seconds, if that.  Moving items from one list to another is effortless.<br /><br />To put it succinctly, WUNDERLIST is perfect!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Almost the best so far. I have not figured out how to delete a location yet as it saint the correct place in my state. I love that the loop is on a 25 minute run as it stays  more current then other weather apps I use too. But it is pretty complete and awesome for being a free app. So no major complaints at all. I would love to see it ring load like a weather radio though. I thought I set it to do that but it never has. But to be fair I have not completely checked everything out yet. I would highly recommend getting this in conjunction with any other app you use. It is worth it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is not like the 100 doors game in that you don't have puzzles to solve etc. But this was fun! You have to think outside the box and be creative which I really liked. If you want a game that makes you really use your thinking skills but isn't ridiculously difficult then you'll like this one! I just wish it had more levels...
B00C6B8TB8|5.0|This movie was one of the first in the phase one of the Marvel universe.  It's a sorta reboot from the rather disappointing Ang Lee Hulk movie and this time it stars Ed norton and Liv Tyler.  It's such a good comic book movie and it stays true to form of the marvel movies.<br /><br />This edition is the steelbook edition that is a metal case that included the blu-ray, dvd and UltraViolet Digital Copy.  It's a part of Universals Reels Heroes line and they're excellent.  This is a movie to pick up for sure.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Hubby and I are addicted. Found this show online and are loving it. It's funny and addicting as well as frustrating at the same time!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I'm a huge comic book collectors and I have a slew of graphic novels.  I own the print version of Watchmen and had to get it on the kindle.  It's excellent to keep a copy on hand whenever you need something to read.  This is written by comic book legend Alan Moore who takes comic book characters and really sets them into reality.  They're not your typical batman or spiderman but characters created in an alternate version of the 80s.  The kindle edition is very nice and the coloring looks great.  I highly reccomend getting this for your kindle if you're a fan of comic books in general.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I have loved the other 2 books and this 1 was good but not as good.I feel as if its been dragged out ,I will get the next book but won't be dying to read it
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is serial TV at its best w/o all the special effects and as I remember it growing up in the sixties
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend so was expecting a lot but I was wrong.I read it in 2 days could not leave it out my hand a really unusual story but just brilliant
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A fun and addictive game. Good for all ages. I love it as well as my grand children ages 3 and 5. Even if they are not able to get all 3 stars, if they get one they are happy. I usually go over the puzzle they have done and get all 3 stars for them. Lovely game.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This was a great movie.  It had it all, humor, love, sadness, family dynamics, etc.  You will be glad you watched it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not a huge fan of Kindle apps but this one is a winner.<br />Fun brain teaser and it makes you feel like MacGyver!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found the game to be challenging. I can't wait to continue playing the games more levels.<br />I only wish there could have  been more levels before it asked me to rate.
B00004R99J|5.0|Our favorite; wonderful way to  portray history through animation and storytelling.  It's a wonderful way to get your little ones interested in history.
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|I enjoy their music.  What can I write.  Either one appreciates their type of music or one doesn't.  I happen to be one of those who appreciate their style.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love big bang. So glad I could find this season. A little expensive. Could have bought CD cheaper but loved watching on kindle.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a bit predictable but this was a beautiful love story and an easy read. Never disappointed by Sparks' novels.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is a great game totally worth the money. It is like the others but with time travel. I highly recommend it.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|So, this is going to be a tricky review to write. I was really caught in between really liking this movie and feeling indifferent towards it. There were a few moments where, if I didn't already know the ending, I would have been genuinely surprised by what happened. Even with that spoiled for me, I still enjoyed the movie and I still really disliked it. So let's break it down into two categories here.<br /><br />Liked it:<br />- The effects were amazing.<br />- It was very stylish (I expected no less.)<br />- Jackie Earle Haley was a great Rorschach.<br />- Night Owl had his charm and Dr. Manhattan was interesting.<br />- The overall plot, being based on the book, I felt was well done for a film adapations.<br /><br />Hated it:<br />- Silk Spectre was more of a sex object than an actual heroine. Malin Akerman's sex scene just devalued the character for me as a whole, because she doesn't really do anything else. She's very one note and feels very helpless.<br />- There is surprisingly little action. More time is spent investigating the Comedian's death rather than focusing on any fight scenes. I didn't feel that this was balanced well in terms of action and plot.<br />- The film was just too gory in a way that made it feel unnecessary. Now I don't dislike gore, after all I loved the new Dredd movie. But in this movie, I just didn't see the purpose in watching arms being broken with fountains of blood gushing out.<br />- The Ozymandias casting choice didn't work for me, or maybe it was the costume. Whatever it was, I didn't enjoy watching him on screen nor did I think the actor did a particular good job for it.<br />- The movie was long, but unlike Lord of the Rings I could -feel- that the movie was long.<br /><br />Overall, as someone who has not read the comic books. It's definitely a movie that will keep you interested, but it's not exactly a film that you're going to come out and say I LOVED THIS MOVIE. It's tepid at its worst and entertaining at its best, but the weak characterization of Silk Spectre and the general lack of super heroics makes it difficult to recommend watching this movie. If you find yourself bored one day, feel free to give this a shot, it will certainly pass the time.weak characterization of Silk Spectre and the general lack of super heroics makes it difficult to recommend watching this movie.

B00005OLY5|5.0|You know Hollywood always focuses on the beautiful and the handsome, so Val Kilmer gets the top bill in this fantasy akin to C.S. Lewis type books. But the real star,who carries the show, is Warrick Davis, who is Willow. He is a very senstive caring man from the midget race of people---a true family man, who is called into a seemingly impossible adventure. He always wanted to be a magician, or sorcerer, as it may be, andin thismovie heis given his chance. There are many special effects, and twists and turns, until the final scene of willow versus the evilsorceress queen,who gets her power from darkness. There is a lotof love and loyalty in this movie, but Willow (Davis) steals the show.It is interesting that in real life Warrick Davis and his family are simple and very nice people.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Says you need to be signed into amazon... Hard to do in A/P mode... That's all I have too say
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is a great game for the kindle, its entertaining enough that I keep playing it over and over. But the game can be just a little laggy sometimes, and the steering controls are a little hard to get used to at first. Also the voice acting isn't the best, but are entertaining at times. over all if you enjoy games like GTA and saints row, this game is for you.
1400052181|5.0|Interesting book.. Allowed me to picture the life of African-Americans in a completely different way. Recommend to all, get it!
0811875040|5.0|I purchase this book because the price was right and I wanted to try some of their recipes.  Turns out the recipes are great and cant wait to go visit the the shop in SF.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is really overrated! it is way too expensive! It is not as great as people say! don't buy this!
B000P0O52E|5.0|This is the second part of a two book cook book set.  I was so excited when I found it.  The delivery was rather quick and the seller even included a handwritten thank you note.  That is what I call customer service!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The first couple chapters were difficult to read but once you get into the book it teaches you a lot. I appreciate him being unbiased and leaving the ending to your own imagination.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|I love this film. It's a great take on a classic story, and I could watch it over and over.
B008Y5FNL4|1.0|This was a terrible movie. It was dark and depressing and had no real point. I kept waiting for it to take off and it never did, it just kept getting worse and worse until the end. The end was so long and boring and disgusting. Why is it that Marlon Brando is considered a good actor? He is always hard to understand and seems dull and boring kind of like this movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the irregular shapes and adjustable sizes. I also like the picture options. It's a lot of fun and the only puzzle game I use.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Great mix of hits by Kelly! Can't wait to see her in Private concert for Scentsy consultants at our convention in 9 days in Indy
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|the sound it make when you bruch the hair WOULD NOT STOP going even after I closed the app don't waste your time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed was a fascinating story that was beautifully written.  Learned so much about another culture.  I highly recommend this book.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have read the book that inspired this movie and i was very impressed. Daniel Day-Lewis had me thinking he went back in time and copied Lincoln's ways.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I had never seen this before I started watching cooking shows and it worked just as easy as they show - crumple up newspaper, then add your brickettes and light the newspaper from the bottom.  When the  coals turn gray (in just a short time) spread them on your grill bottom and start cooking.  No need to use that awful, chemical charcoal lighter liquid or charcoal that has been soaked in lighter fluid.....just use plain old charcoal and it works fine!  VERY pleased!  :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|was very happy for this movie to be made now awaiting parts 2-3 and the extended cut of this film
B0094K1IPI|5.0|I was pleased to find Gladiator streaming HD on Amazon. This is magnificent storytelling via film, from international cast & crew, through landscape, score, film & editing techniques.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|the x-men are back and united against enemy william stryker who seeks to destroy all mutants, will they stop him in time? watch and find out but highly recommended if you never saw first movie see that first
B001EC2IV2|5.0|Arnold in one of his best turns as a different type of terminator.  James Caan plays a great, bad man.  Vanessa Williams, well, she is Vanessa.  Hang in there until the end.
B005LAII12|5.0|This comedy movie is the funniest movie i have seen in a long time, definitely not the teddy bear you are use to as a kid so if you want not an average teddy bear watch this and prepare to laugh
B0006GAOJA|5.0|This was a great movie that was very low priced! I love it. I've been wanting to watch it since I am a fan of classics, and Amazon allowed me to do so inexpensively!
B005PK57IK|5.0|This story shows a very strong, smart, ethical woman, mother, and lawyer trying to deal with betrayal and dishonesty and to always do what is best for her children and her clients.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|awesome... not only is it entertaining, the legal aspects are accurate enough to provide working examples that help me with law school
B00005OWIU|4.0|CD arrived as promised.  John Williams is an amazing composer and you can't help but get tingles down your spine when you hear the opening theme.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|awesome... not only is it entertaining, the legal aspects are accurate enough to provide working examples that help me with law school
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Dark and elegant.. absolutely gorgeous! The photography, there score, the dialogue .. poetically visceral. I never thought I would accept anyone other than sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter .....until now. It's a MUST SEE
B00CW665VI|5.0|Reading the story was like sitting in a room (or at the bar) with the guy who just needs someone to talk to.  Drew and Kate 's journey to each other is funny, emotional and satisfying.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like this style of game, it makes you think, which is a good thing. The first these I've tried and I love it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I feel used.  I expected a trilogy and I got a teaser.  This series can only get less interesting as the author/publisher  drags it out.  I can see myself waiting a year or 2 to MAYBE buy another in the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book, not just a silly romance. This book actually was interesting from a human behavior perspective. Throw in some hot kinky sex and a few twists and this story kept me interested until the very end, when I rewarded myself with Book 2 of the series!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has some good I candy and works well for the input provided by a mobile phone.  I keep coming back for more but really wander if I'll ever beat the game
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Before purcashing, I'd catch it every time it was on MaxHD. Music is a big part...gotta love my Thunderstruck.  It had everythng..great looking guys, a badass chick and aliens.  Plus, I use to beat my brother playing &#34;BATTLESHIP&#34;...
B00004YRQA|5.0|I got this memory card for my husband's play station 2. He loves it.
B002GHHHP6|1.0|The DVDs don't work, when put in the players, it says &#34;load disc load disc&#34; when the disc is in the player. They must of formatted the disc wrong
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Always had me turning the pages.!!! Funny and worth the buy!! Would recommend it most definitely! I love the ending!!
B0036TGSIK|1.0|I ordered the DVD in high def, but instead I got the bluesy disc in the mail. Probably just an pops but still now I have to send it back again
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is easy to use.  Easy to see. Yet very challenging to play. So many different levels to play<br />Fun
B005GSZZ1A|1.0|So very sad that this young boy had to live through all of this hell!!  Hard to believe  people in North Korea behave in this manner. Despicable !
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|....it's a decent watch. A well-done production will often save a weak script in this type of far-fetched premise. This is an example.
B000OVLINI|5.0|It's been a whole since I was drawn into the world of the story. The author masterfully weaves a tale that gets deeper and more complex as it progresses, developing characters and stories with expertise. A very enjoyable experience.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|I don't play a whole lot of games on my phone.  It's a nice distraction when waiting for who I'm shopping with, doc office, etc. I got Helidroid, and my favorite levels were the ones with missles.  I jumped at the chance to try this one, and have not been disappointed.  It's fun and challenging, and didn't take long to get the basics.  I don't want a game that has so many options to make it realistic that learning it becomes a full-time job.  This is a great balance.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|The first half of the album contains lots of great songs, both popular and not, but it loses some of the energy after Funhouse.  I would've liked to have a more memorable song to finish out the album, but overall it is a worthwhile purchase.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Does n ot fit into my car's charger as advertised. A complete waste of my money.  Very dissatisfiedwith this product!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is relaxing and challenging at the same time and it will give you hints if you can't find that small last piece.... :)
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|((This release..))<br />Is What the last \\"at least\\", 4- TateRyche Releases Have NOT been..<br />And Yes..  ((That's a GOOD THING..))<br />The Last few \\"direc-TATE-ed\\"... releases Have Been so far Off course, and self indulgent. And Really Left me, and I'm sure \\"MANY OTHER\\" long time Queensryche fans, Disappointed and even cheated..<br />This Release brings back the triumphant return of QUEENSRYCHE to all its former glory.<br />The reason I only gave this a 4 star..<br />Is for the 2- cheat \\"intro type\\" tracks.. instead of actual songs.<br />Welcome back, and we are looking forward to the next offering.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is great to pass time by and is a little boring at times not fun waiting to receive more energy...
B005K17RU0|1.0|I gave AccuWeather a poor rating because it didn't update for some time.<br />I did like the constant notification of the temp and weather, but this to was usually behind the time by about 10 hours.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very addicting.<br />Although there is one flaw that I think should be better and that is the graphics. It would be cool if everything didn't cost money.but anyway its a pretty cool game.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|although I enjoyed the movie and the issues it dealt with on properly raised children. It left me a sense that I was watching a Man flick. From the middle of the film till the last thirty minutes of the movie, the theater was empty. There was endless battle that neither side can win. First half was all about him searching for his roots and having lots of flash back to the good old days when he was a kid.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was hooked within minutes. Easy to play, I suggest keeping a pen and paper to help with some of the clues.
B00455IVHU|5.0|Great acting.  Lauren Bacall was a great choice for the mother.  Very funny and touching.  I've seen it at least twice, but still love the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|An amazing game to connect with friends and make buildings and mining and also fighting mobs. Great updates. Functions great.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|Works great and keeps my passwords and other private information synchronized with my desktop computer.  The product was easy to use and update.
B004TRKH9O|5.0|All I will say is this...<br /><br />To fully appreciate Zeit, you must first listen to Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music in its entirety.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's definitely not a quick summer read but I really enjoyed this book.  It is a hard subject to read about, but very well done. Highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Superb acting, excellent writing, twists and turns make for an excellent show. I can't wait to see each episode! I watch very little TV but this is a must see.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book, enjoyed from beginning to end. Can't wait to read the next one. Hungar game books are the best
B001NFRA90|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be able to see these guys at a place called the Coach House in Southern Ca. It was an amazing show and is a great CD. I was able to stand off to the side of the stage when the show was over and was able to shake everyones hand as they went to their dressing room EXCEPT. . . . . Keith &#34;I'm too bitchin' to acknowledge a fan&#34; Emerson. What a prima donna, he just looked down at my extended hand and looked up at me as if I was some bum on the street. I'll never forget that. So if you ever read this Mr. Emerson, thanks for the memories.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Love playing this game with my son. Which pretty much is for him to play. I may play this game sometimes.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|IT was fun that were some levels of &#34;meaning&#34; in this flick. IT was not just silly humor and a predictable story line. Nice job, writers...
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Love playing UNO!! This is my favorite game to play. Grew up playing this game. I wouldn't trade this game for no other game!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very easy to figure out but you will have to help the younger kids with the missions so they can advance.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Great album. Maybe not quite as good as the first. Fits great into my collection of folk rock and irish rock.
0670022705|5.0|This book makes a great gift for your curious friends and family!!  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves history!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtown Abbey has depth and color; I cannot recall being more interested in a show in quite some time.  The acting is superb and the storyline gives historical context while delivering a dramatic masterpiece.  A great show to watch with your teens.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is one of my re-reads... Just completed the &#34;Hit&#34; and want to go back to refresh the history... Excellent re-read...<br />Looking for more about Will Robie...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app at my work computer, my phone, kindle, and personal cell phone.  Notes are available anytime I need.  Perfect for recording meetings at work, notes for store, or just helpful items for later. Love it :)
0440423228|2.0|Glad I was able to peek before buying. The Art is certainly Quality ,but the Characters and General Design is SO Generic looking I decided not buy. Loved the idea of this when I saw it talked about. Upon examination - disappointed....Sorry, but no matter how much I love something ,not buying just Anything just to have MORE.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|So yeah they said it was an alright movie at least good for a rent. If your a huge Marky Mark fan than you'll probably get a thrill out of this film(or so I'm told).
B00AM0C6YG|2.0|This is the most disappointing album I have heard in recent memory. From the 1st song to the last , I was kept waiting for something profound to happen from Ms. Mvula. According to her press , she the new Nina Simone, I don't think so. Brit singers like Connie Rae Bailey , Rhonda Dakar and Sade have more emotion. Its a shame but now this cd goes in to my least listened to stack. I don't recommend this cd.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Well never cared for any Oz related stuff ever in my life ,and I'm sure actual fans of the franchise are not to happy with this installment(as is usually the case) I however found it to be just Meh. Now I treated it as just a movie ,and disassociated it from any prior material related to the franchise(kind of had to considering I barely remember the original movie ,and that is as far as I went when it comes to the story). I will never watch it again ,but as a rent just to say I've seen it that worked for me. As for anyone else I really can't say though it never hurts to just rent it ,and make up your own mind.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|I've seen it four times already, and it still holds up. It's a keeper...at least once a year for me.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|Yeah story was a D+ ,but I didn't go in looking for A+ story. I went in looking for action ,and it was about a B-. you should at least give this a rent it never hurts to form your own opinion about stuff.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your reading nook!!!! Symbols secrets and twists will lead you down a path of confusion and then the light will be shown to you.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|I read this on the edge of my seat. Having seen the film, and been scared out of my wits, I picked this up with an idea of the story. The book (as always!) tells the fuller story. Scary. Edgy. Fabulous.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a wonderful book with a perfect mix full of scientific facts and a wonderful local family.  I live in Glen Burnie, a city just outside of Baltimore and I loved reading about all local history that was entwined in this book. I recommend this book to everyone I cross paths with.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written. I was a little surprised and disappointed in the ending.  I will probably read more of us books now.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|When I choose Serbian keyboard... letters become so small because everything is showed... The better way would be to have english keyboard but with pop up letters with long-pressing the letter... For now, I will change my keyboard to stock :/ until the changes are made... Because it's annoying to delete letters every second while typing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Book recommendation by my sister in law who is a 5 th grade teacher to my 10 year old son.  He and I both read it.  It was a life changing book.  Incredible life lesson:  \\"be kinder than necessary\\"  5 stars!
B00022LRXA|5.0|Before and After Science is an aura progression from Eno's glamourpuss phase and the ambient tones of Another Green World and takes the listener into one of electronic music's best musical experiences.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|other reviews say it's easy to a point. not so. even my teenage granddaughter had problems getting through it. a waste of time.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I simply could not put this book down! It was great! Loved how both main characters had so much in common. Loved the ending too!
B008QTV3X0|3.0|While the story line seems interesting and I will continue to watch more,  the HD streaming to my PC was quite choppy.  I will try the standard version next time to compare.  It will also be cheaper.  I had all required updates on my computer and I do not have the same problem with other providers.  I will also try playing from the download and also directly to my TV without the Pc to see if it is better.  Look for updates after I watch the next episode.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Nice writing...but did not enjoy this nearly as much as the first two books...jumped around any too much for me...
B007V693YK|5.0|The app works fine for me, the tabs and the music are SLIGHTLY off at times, but if you are at least semi-decent at whatever you play, THEN THIS SHOULDN'T BE A problem. This app is by far the best tab finder and reader on the app store. 5 stars two thumbs up!
B000QEIORG|5.0|I still buy CDs and my old cd had gotten scratched so it was time to replace it.  Happy happy happy
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Had some very heartwarming and funny moments. William Macy was great as were Helen Hunt and John Hawkes. John did a fantastic job of portraying Mark O'Brien. What an inspiring man he was.
0385535147|3.0|I have read all of John Grisham's novels since 1993.Sad to say,this is probably another disappointment just like The Associate,The Appeal and The Broker.Too bad that Mr.Grisham have used the same formulas of his past great novels like The Pelican Brief(a dead judge),The Innocent Man(a man being jailed despite being innocent) and The Firm(working with the FBI) in this formulaic and mediocre novel.Too bad that the character was simply unreliable and the reader would not feel any care nor sympathy towards him.In the end,it is far from being a legal thriller.Also,one must consider that the novel was in a first-person narration.Realize that Malcomn/Max is an UNRELIABLE NARRATOR to fully appreciate the story.His narrative should be taken with a grain of salt so as not to get confused on the sudden plot turns and somewhat \\"twisted facts\\" when reading it.In the end,it is better for the reader who expects a great novel from the popular author to either just wait for the paperback edition or better yet just borrow it from the library for free just like I did.I hope the his next novel,The Sycamore Row,a sequel to A Time To Kill,and another story about the Jack Brigace will be a better one as compared to the Max Baldwin/Malcomn Bannister in The Racketeer.
B005544V6A|5.0|Brilliant writing!  The characters are amazing and we are hooked!  We hope there are many more seasons to come because we plan to watch every episode!!!!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I don't care what age you are this is a great movie. The whole family enjoys it. You sure won't regret buying this.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Good cast, good lines, and the good Guy wins.<br />Marisa Tomei is always good to see, and McConaughey and her to hit it off well.
0446604844|5.0|I'm returning to Baldacci's older books having read the 4 newest and liking them all.  Yes, this one was perhaps overlong, but interesting all the way if one hangs in there.  Sidney is smart as is Sawyer.  Those are the main characters.  But I found all characters quite well done.  I had a clue somewhere in there and figured where it was all going, but had not a clue as to how it would all happen.  I did care about our main characters and the tension they were all involved in along the way.  And the ending I found quite touching.  As I said, the main characters were very well done especially.  Just stay with it.  It's a great story.
B007R0WHMK|3.0|Intriguing story, but not sure if I got the point of the director.  Gross depictions of child birth, funny at times.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a really great show, a lot like Psych but a little more dramatic at times. Donna is epically awesome.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|Here's another showcase of Woody Allen's ability to portray a protagonist in an existential crisis - a bleak subject - and coat the whole situation in wonderful humor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was dramatic but so sweet and filled with love I got my moneys worth no doubt about it at all
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a while, I highly recommend to anyone who is searching for something new to read!
1452115567|5.0|I follow maddie on instagram and facebook. I love having the book! Maddie reminds me of my doggie Rosco. Love
1427229201|5.0|Can't wait for the next book in the series.  Each book ends with a cliff-hanger.  We listen to books on cd when we travel
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book. We got the chance to see more of Gideon. We saw the unconditional love they have for each other.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|I've given this record at least 20 listens to date. I'll get the \\"bad\\" out of the way first. It loses a star because of the mastering. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch, but this thing is just too \\"loud\\". It's not as bad as Death Magnetic, for example, but it's noticeable and annoying. I can't give 5 stars in good conscience with this defect.<br /><br />Onto the music. Ignore the two instrumentals. They don't add much to the product. The rest of the tracks? I'm hearing nods to the \\"classic\\" QR all over this thing, and I love it.<br /><br />\\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\" starts with a definite Rage For Order vibe. When Todd sings his first line...\\"So here we are again, as we plead upon our knees\\" it is clear: they got the right man for the job.<br /><br />\\"Spore\\" continues the RFO vibe in my mind. A mid tempo \\"fist pumper\\" similar to \\"The Whisper\\"<br /><br />\\"In This Light\\" has \\"radio hit\\" written all over it (if rock radio were actually still alive). This one could have easily fit on Empire or Promised Land.<br /><br />\\"Redemption\\" was the first track QR released to the public. A nice introduction to the LaTorre era.<br /><br />\\"Vindication\\" is honestly the one track I find myself skipping. It's not bad, but it doesn't stand out to me.<br /><br />\\"A World Without\\" is the best track on the record, IMO (maybe that's why I keep skipping \\"Vindication\\"). A haunting ballad about the loss of a loved one. The line \\"A mother, my lover, my best friend...my best friend\\" = goosebumps.<br /><br />\\"Don't Look Back\\" speeds things back up. Probably the heaviest track on the record. Sounds more like European power metal than QR to me. I could see this track on the next Mystic Prophecy record, for example. Great stuff that showcases Todd's range. He crushes the high notes on this one.<br /><br />\\"Fallen\\" is another radio friendly track. Short, sweet and to the point.<br /><br />\\"The Open Road\\" is a strong power ballad to close out the record.<br /><br />I've heard complaints about the length of the record. Get over it. No one complains that \\"Reign in Blood\\" is only 29 minutes long! This record leaves me craving more, a rare occurrence these days.<br /><br />Some bands play new songs live and everyone runs for the bathroom or another beer. I don't see that happening here. Bottom line - this one holds it's own vs. the \\"classic\\" QR catalog. Buy it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This was for my granddaughter she needed it for her ipod.so I let her download it since it is the in thing for teens
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|While the Calculator Plus Free is not especially innovative it is extremely convenient, at you fingertips, so to speak, letting you turn from reading, browsing, etc. to calculating without changing devices.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|all time favorites. I enjoyed re-watching this every bit as much the 2nd time as I did the first. End
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game a lot. I play it with my friends and my family. We all have a great time trying to beat eachother.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really like the cover on/off automatic feature.It is a great cover. It really is an improvement over covers I have on my other KINDLES.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|A history that every american should know. This book should be required reading in every school in the country. Well written. It vividly describes the unjust and unfair way our Native Americans have been treated. Shameful and brutal.
0393338398|5.0|I saw the movie, good movie. I heard of Moneyball a lot and recently I read Trading Bases by Joe Peta that talks about baseball and gambiing and Wall Street. It whetted my apetite to read Moneyball and even though the book was written 2003, it still resonates today. I was not disappointed. It was easy to read and being a sport fan, I recognize players of years ago but what like about the book is that you were like a fly in the wall with strong narrative skills explaining what Billy Beane was doing in a easy and simple way that you sort of understand this fascination with numbers.<br /><br />The plot is simple, Billy Beane was a baseball player that had superstar written all over him. He over thinks about being a ball player and pretty much is out as a player. He comes back and re-invents himself as a General Manager of the Oakland A's and piggybacking from Bill JamesWho is the father of saber metrics), Sandy Alderson,  the GM before him who believe in putting numbers to player on efficiency. The mantra was on base percentage. Even if the guy was blind, if he had great OBP, Beane will try to get him. Oakland with no money and in the low rent district had to compete with the likes of the Yankees( who one player made more then the whole Oakland time worth around 120 million). But compete they did, Beane made it a science, his assistant Paul Deposta from Harvard- gleaned the most of players no body wanted. No team was calculating or running the numbers, the way the Oakland did( now each team has several number analyst running the numbers).<br /><br />It a great book. See the movie first then read the book- if you do it reverse you will be disappointed. The book explains it so that most people could understand this phenomena.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like a good book I couldn't put it down!  I want more!  Keeps the brain sharp if it doesn't drive crazy.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am late getting into this show.  After seeing the end of Damages, another great legal drama I was looking for something of that caliber.  The Good Wife is excellent, with great acting and story lines.  I am intrigued by Alicia's character and appreciate the depth and complexities the writing and her acting adds to her character. I'm hooked and already almost done watching season 2 on my Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've played minecraft for years now and pocket edition is ancient minecraft I have computer and xbox<br />but like I said this is alpha its ancient
B000HL09MG|4.0|I was surprised at the nudity. But I'm glad I watched it. It's hard to believe that it was released as long ago as 1999.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Excellent program to watch.  This is weird that you have to enter a bunch of comments just to give it stars...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I honestly haven't read a book this intense in a long long time. If. Ever. And I read a lot. This book is by far my favourite yet. So incredibly intense and so very good. I read it in five sit downs. Holding onto every word. She does an amazing job keeping the book flowing fast and perfect. Once you think you can put it down for a breather, something else happens and you are sucked right back in. Incredible just incredible.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Excellent program to watch.  This is weird that you have to enter a bunch of comments just to give it stars...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Hated the way it ended, but that is what the author wanted!  Ms Flynn sucked me into the story and then spit me out!
B0091REZMW|4.0|the begining of this game is alittle annoying with all the pop ups. i havent played much yet but so far its fairly entertaining
B00CO6QGCE|1.0|I could never get it to shut off, and it drained the battery. Had to uninstall it. I loved using it, but the app runs constantly. Please fix!
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|The only bad thing about this season is we watched it immediately & now we have to wait a year or more for the next season.<br />Come on season 3!!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is a very good game to test your eye to ball expertise.  Lots of fun to play.  One of the best.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|excellent coverage about the dangers of any fundamentalist religious dogma...  fell quite  short in the promise of &#34;proof&#34; in chapter four however.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like that in this second book is explained where the perversion comes from and more background stories from the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Usually these games bore me half way through the first level. Not this one. It's a free game and it's entertaining...it doesn't get much better than this.
B0053TMP24|4.0|This is a really good book. It had me turning pages until the end. I recommend this book ,it was great.
B00821OX98|3.0|Falling skies has a weak start, but it begins to pick up near the end. The problem here is it BEGINS to pick up near the end... My opinion may be slightly biased after already catching up with Defiance which is a great show. One thing I believe this show has going for its ratings is that everyone is expendable besides the Masons. You'll see when you watch it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very easy to read and apply! Makes you feel wonderful so the manifestation starts!!!! Enjoy it! Thank you Pam Grout! 4
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|High quality animation, good story line and interesting character development. Humorous and ntertaining for the whole family. Two thumbs up.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I use mine on most of our kitchen knives and it works great. Fast, simple, small. Would be good to take or have with camping gear. I've given 3 of these as gifts and they all liked them.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My daughters LOVE all the Dr Panda apps. They are all wondeeful and interactive. The Veggie Garden app is so much fun for my girls. I have the free app installed on my phone and my kindle fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is still the best series I have seen in a very long time.  Won't miss it for anything. Great actors
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I like dragonvale. it is a fun game but this game took up all my app space. I only had 2 other games. I COULDN'T go on the Internet ether. It had to sadly go. :(
1450400957|5.0|This book is great! The illustrations are fascinating and beautiful, as well as being extremely informative and useful. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in health, exercise, and anatomy. The book has more than illustrations however. It goes through a vast number of exercises, depicting what muscles the exercise works, how to properly do each exercise, and ways to modify it. The book also goes through a very intensive section in the beginning about scheduling exercise, tracking it, what certain terms means, how to arrange your schedule and how you exercise in order to achieve the results you wish (getting lean or bulking up, etc).<br /><br />Overall this book is ridiculously informative and interestind. A definite 5 out of 5 stars from me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool!! You get to take care of your very own horse and you do everything you do in real life to take care of him. You feed him, groom him, clean his stables, train him for competitions, compete in competitions, and more!!!! You also have to keep him happy and healthy. I would recommend this game to everyone!!!! 5 stars!!!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is ridiculously entertaining. I love it. It is so amusing and the continuous miscommunications are hilarious to me. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who enjoys comedy. This is not a movie to take seriously in any way, lighten up!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I gave it one star because I cant give it no stars the game is fun however it is so overrun with people useing cheat codes that it isn't worth playing anymore
B0019CSXAM|5.0|This show definitely isn't for everyone, but I love it and so do most of my friends. It is very amusing.<br /><br />This season was sent to me in a timely manner and it was received in a neat package and blemish-free. So no complaints in those departments.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I liked it very much. It had excitement and a love story. It was a little violent so wouldn't be good for young children.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a must have app. If you ever find yourself bored then this is the app to play!  The levels get very challenging and will leave you pulling your hair!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|really good special effects kept the language down to a minimum only a few f words a good twist on the original story
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great little game good for kids. I love the movies and this game is totally awesome and fun for everyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was convinced I knew the way the story was going. Don't get ahead of yourself , this book twists and turns. The end well....enjoy the ride!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|it is wonderful to see the classics again and to compare with the new version of star trek. It is really cool!!!
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Althought the story and graphics are pretty cool and the plot does keep you from sticking to the game, some parts are not easy to play for they are not logical to follow within the game's course. Like i said fairly entertaining
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Great blu ray. The enhanced effects are great. Had TOS on regular DVD but never got past the 3rd disc. These blu rays are great. Highly recommend. Already finished 1st season. Thanks, Brian
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Its a good book. The author has covered each aspect of the story in detail. The author made me feel everything as if It was me going through it.
1118273052|4.0|I have always had a preconceived notion of who and what these high rolling traders were.  They have gained my respect not only for the skill they have as traders but more so for what they do with the money.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love real steel the movie and I had some coins so I searched for some fun games and found this one and thought oh that looks cool and bought it t is a amazing game it has a new character if u pay a little money u can get ZEUS!!!! I love the new character u can ripe enemies head off after beating the crap out of them
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very quick read. I could not put it down. Great writer, very descriptive. I would recommend it to any female..initially there maybe a turn off to this \\"type\\" of book, but it really is not what it seems.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book hits home every teen should read this book to understand that people are out there and are willing to help if u ever feel that depressed
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it. You have to be patient and think through the clues that are presented. Some are obvious and some take a little more imagination.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Wresting look at Broadway.  I enjoyed this series's. great music and an interesting story. Loved the drama between Anjelica Huston and her husband.
B00AALX5SI|5.0|I really didn't think this movie was going to be good, but I love Katy Perry and gave it a shot. I wasn't disappointed.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|More great acting, sets, writing and costumes from this wonderful series.  I'm looking forward to watching season 3 and 4, and 5, and...
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great fun with excellent graphics on my asus transformer with nvidia tegra 3 quad core processor.  Very exciting game that is well worth downloading!  Many levels and armor unlocks available make this a great game!  Highly recommend!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all of this authors books. I am I awe with how he writes. I am always drawn into the world he creates and deeply attached to the characters. This book was no different.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|game is so fun! I love playing ball with pinkie and collecting apples with applejack. I would definitely spend real money on this game!
B002EMESSM|2.0|Way too much emphasis On the special effects The scene where they slow mo look at the new enterprise that lasts about 15 minutes is So long it's hilarious.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This movie took me straight back to my chilhood. Its a great, imaginative film that is entertaining to children and parents alike.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|all my grand kids and me love this game it is so much fun for everyone thank you.. thank you
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller is very good, was necessary to play with other player.<br /><br />Is comfortable, easy and resistant.<br /><br />We hope have long live.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I thought this movie was actually pretty entertaining. The puns scattered about where rather funny as well and for me, coming to a movie to be entertained, I appreciated it. It looked very good too and I thought they did a good job with the giants. Acting was not the best, hence the 4 star rating but overall I enjoyed this film.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|A great movie with a great message! I have watched it many times and look forward to watching it again in the future. My 20 yr old daughter watched with me and enjoyed it also. Highly recommended!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|the diamonds don't move as fast as I think they should because I am ready and trying to make my next move and it is still at a stand still, but it will definitely do in a pinch. I do like it enough to keep it!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I read the whole series of these books and I like them very much. it is recommended for the people who like Fantasy
B009G41CG2|1.0|Very hard to see the tiles because of the lack of good contrast. Also s help feature would be a welcome addition.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|Great concepts, great writing and worth a read if you're into scifi. It's part detective, part blade runner and part Burning Chrome.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Very good movie that keeps you guessing till the end. Would recommend this to any Tom Hanks can. Halle Berry was pretty good also
1439156816|5.0|A fantastic book for aspiring writers. In interweaves lessons he's learned on writing, guidelines and just plain old stories about his life. By the end of it I really felt like I had been struck my the lightning muse of writing. Better than any other book I've read on the craft. This is not a book for those looking for instructions on nouns or a how to write ABC.
B001NA6096|1.0|talk, talk, talk.  Maybe we were in the mood for something with a bit more action, or a comedy, or whatever, but we only watched half of it and gave up.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I generally liked this book but don't feel it is worthy of the Pulitzer Prize.  I found the structure in the second half of the book overly \\"clever\\" and convoluted.  Still the story was compelling and seems to describe well the spirit of the Korean regime
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game which has you thinking.  The solutions are not easy yet every room can be escaped.  Had a great time with this one.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|It's a good little photo editor if you just want to do basic touch ups. If you're looking for a more substantial editor, this isn't it. But it gets the job done.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is fine. It does make you use your brain. Its a good time killing game :)<br />I like it a lot. A few levels I got stuck on.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|Love this whole album, lots of rock and blues combination! Fantastic guitarist!! Reminds me of Hendricks, and Stevie Ray Vaughn, put together.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|The sounds on this album are all classically Daft Punk.  But the genius here is that they used session musicians for much of the sounds, instead of synthesizer, giving the whole album a warmer, richer sound.  The album ties together thematically with most of the songs giving a nod to 70s disco.  Overall, Daft Punk knocked it out of the park with this one.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I've been a Sudoku fan since junior high when my math teacher passed out sheets of it for us to play whenever we got bored. So, what do you think I did as soon as I got my Kindle? Buy this?<br /><br />Nope. I went and got Sudoku Free. And it was pretty good, but nonetheless it got boring after a while, so I ended up deleting it.<br /><br />Trying to decide what to do, I saw this as the FAOTD. After checking out all the reviews, I downloaded it. And I'm happy to say that this one's a keeper!<br /><br />Not only does it have 8 different difficulty levels, but it also has many different styles of Sudoku, most of which I've not played. This includes classic, of course, which is a good relief after playing all those other styles (some more tedious than others, especially on Nightmare mode).<br /><br />I also really enjoy the hints system for this version. The algorithms that it uses are great for helping me get out of a jam when I fall into the habit of just placing numbers randomly instead of using the pencil markings (which, by the way, are also very useful and I can't believe I've gone all these years trying to do this stuff in my head!). The logic behind the algorithms is a little confusing at first, but after examining the board enough, it makes more sense to me.<br /><br />And there's the thing that I enjoy most of all: it's unlimited gameplay! Now that, in my opinion, is much better than having to go buy a new book every time you run out of puzzles...<br /><br />So, in short, I definitely recommend this game. It's loads of fun and a must-have for Sudoku fans.<br /><br />- Sam
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This one didn't take as long to get into as the first one for me!  I felt this one was an easier read.  Looking forward to the next one.  I will recommend these to my sisters and mom!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I really enjoy this application. I haven't even used my Kindle's built-in PDF reader because this one is too good! Not only can you read PDF documents with, but you can do all sorts of annotations with it. In addition, this application also allows you to create empty PDF documents for drawing or taking notes. For that level of functionality, I'd recommend getting a stylus. It could all be done by fingers, but a stylus makes it much easier.<br /><br />My only complaint, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars, is the reoccurring glitches with the zoom and scrolling functions. Often when I'm scrolling while zoomed in, it'll zoom out on me and I'll have to zoom back in. Other times I'll scroll to the very end of a document and it'll go back to the beginning of the document. Unfortunately it happens with almost every document I open, and it gets annoying at times.<br /><br />In my opinion, however, the benefits outweigh the costs for this app. I'm very pleased with this product and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has patience to deal with the glitches. It's worth it.<br /><br />- Sam
1781162646|5.0|Part coming-of-age story, part amateur sleuth murder-mystery, the protagonist narrator takes us on a nostalgic journey forty years in the past to the summer of 1973 when a job at an amusement park called Joyland forever changed his life.<br /><br />Joyland has a ghost and a terrifying tale of murder to go with it, but this isn't a typical Stephen King horror story. In fact, it's not really a horror story at all.<br /><br />It's sharp and observant when it comes to the things that are important to us in our youth, and there are quite a few passages worth highlighting for the sage wisdom that King espouses through his characters - i.e. \\"The last good time always comes, and when you see the darkness creeping toward you, you hold on to what was bright and good. You hold on for dear life.\\"<br /><br />In the end, however, it's about relationships: with parents, our first love, our friends, and the strange yet wonderful people who enter our lives for such a short period of time, yet who have a profound influence over who we become.<br /><br />My opinion: it's a great story and well worth reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You get to take care of your own horse and enter it in competition. Great for me because I don't have a horse.
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|I have watched this several times. I think we are in this hourglass situation until You get it right. What does the individual get from a release from terrestrial and physical earth? I don't know. But it must be better, or at least it must be an absence of what we deal with here, on earth. I guess the moral of the story is be good. Demons are all the objects we value as important in life. This is an excellent film....that no one will ever see. I love it when I do something good for someone and no one sees it and I forget about it in a week.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is highly addictive!!! It may seem slow at first but it's worth the money!!! I can't wait until season 2!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|As the game progresses snap-to feature stops working.  When there are two columns left and toy press one to add to the other it will go to an empty column.  Otherwise it is just like &#34;spider&#34; from other producers.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book was great up until the ending. It just felt out of place. If it ended with what I imagined it would have be amazing!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|East read. Coud not put books down.  Looking forward to the next installment of the book.  Thank you for a good read.
B000I9YLWG|5.0|why do you only get to wahch it on amazan. why cant you get it on dvd after you wach it on amazan. because i wanted it on dvd<br /><br />and thats my review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its very addictive! I would play this game all day if I could. I love to jump on the trains and collect coins its really fun!
B000000OF6|5.0|A greatest hits collection will hardly please everyone.  There will always be a song that you like that will not make it into the collection.  This Queen collection has great songs in it.  If one of your songs is missing then buy the album that has it - simple.<br /><br />The audio quality is outstanding.  Enjoy.
B00BXI26XC|5.0|Have you ever looked up in the sky and wondered where a plane was going?  Now you can find out.  This is a fun app that will show you all the planes in the area (wow).  Amazing to see how many flights are in the air at once, no wonder those flight controllers are busy!  This will tell you where the plane started and where it's going to land and the type of plane, flight height and air speed plus more.  It's possible to track a flight that someone is on to see where they are and when they will arrive.<br />You'll enjoy this app!
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Honest admission.... I'd watch Maggie Smith eat cereal.  However this movie way under-utilizes her talent and the story seems very contrived.  In fact, all the actors are top notch!  Such a fantastic cast, but their roles demote them to caricatures.  All I could think of at one point is that poor Dumbledore (actor Michael Gambon who plays Cedric Livingston) has become the cranky head-master of a retirement community and is having trouble keeping Professor McGonagall from casting confundus charms on the unsuspecting Muggle, Cissy Robson (Pauline Collins).  The comic moments seemed to vacillate between sweet and uncomfortable, but mostly centering on ho hum. Overall, this movie just fell flat when it should not have at all with that cast!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is so much fun I like to drive the cars and kill the rich guys! Have fun playing this hilarious game and play it all the time :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what it is supposed to do--calculates.  Has a few enhancements that are also appreciated.  Definitely worth the price I paid.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The beginning was a little struggle to get through for me but then the flow of the story was just great. Anyone who loves dogs will appreciate this story as it speaks the way we believe and feel our canines think.  Good writing,, good flow and the end ties to the beginning.  Loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the finest drama series ever. The script, the acting, the directing is without equal--if you like British dramas.<br />It grabs you into submission immediately and keeps you watching. My wife and I began watching Ep 1 Season 1 and then watched all 3 seasons over a period of two weeks.<br />We anxiously are waiting for season 4.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I've seen this movie about 8 times now... I never get tired of watching my favorite super hero's take on the world! RDJ is AWESOME as Iron Man and I LOVE Chris Hemsworth as Thor! They are both perfect for their roles! It has some slow moving parts but it all leads up to the fast action pace of the bad guys coming from outer space and everyone's favorite hero's saving the day! You do need to watch past the credits to catch a glimpse of the next villain and the very end when you see all the hero's at a food joint that RDJ suggests after a long battle.... Either way you look at it... I'd watch any of the Avenger Movies because I like the actors and the funny moments throughout the movie.... This movie really is perfect for anyone at any age....
B00C4XYEBW|3.0|I don't like Black Sabbath without Bill Ward, and I don't like Judas Priest without KK Downing!  Now that the band is down to only 3 original members, it seems a little bland.  Maybe all the fast edits were an attempt to make the show seem more exciting than it actually was (video editing is REALLY terrible).  Faulkner is very, very good... but it just shows you how much greater KK Downing is.  Playing is SO much more than technique, and the secret glue is just not there... You can just feel that things are not quite right.  Judas Priest needs all 4 original members to be complete.  It seems just as foolish as replacing Halford way back when... ­Nostradamus is a far better sampling of the modern Priest.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game that is challenging enough to keep you puzzling but solvable enough to keep you interested. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys solving puzzles.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Keeps you guessing where it's going and then a surprise ending! Has some slow moments but well worth sticking with it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great game. Well worth buying the full version. Even better then it's predecessors. I have enjoyed all of the magic the gathering games. Now if they would only come out with a new shandalaar adventure game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It's easier to play on the kindle than the actual cards, especially when I play out on my deck. It's kind of addictive
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|A wonderful movie for all to view. This story has a great moral<br />to it. which gives one something to have each day of our lives.
0399165274|3.0|The Jason Bourne film trilogy is a set of very good films. But a Frederick Forsyth fan reading the original source material may find it a frantic hysterical mess. After a few pages, all the exclamation points get very tiring. The hyper-kinetic cartoon action makes James Bond look like a narcoleptic sloth. After two chapters of a Forsyth book, anyone who loves Ludlum will be asleep in their beach chair .<br /><br />Forsyth has always been a much quieter read. Exclamation points are rare. He's a master of his craft, who possibly has his books edited by his CPA because they are meticulously plotted, almost to boredom, with very little dialog.<br /><br />Forsyth is definitely not to everyone's taste. His last few books were weakly written and not up to his earlier books. \\"Kill List\\" is a better book than \\"The Cobra\\" and much better than \\"The Afghan\\". It is not equal to the classic \\"The Jackal\\" or \\"Dogs of War\\" but it is an honest effort. I was happy to find it in my hands.<br /><br />If you're looking for snappy dialog ala Elmore Leonard, look elsewhere. If you want odd characters involved in screwball nuttiness ala Carl Hiassen, you have definitely come to the wrong book. There's not a lot emotional involvement, but it is interesting to follow along.<br /><br />I suspect an uncredited ghostwriter lent a hand in writing \\"The Kill List\\". Mr. Forsyth is 74 now, not that old, but he has been a published author for nearly 45 years, since \\"the Biafra story\\".
0345803507|1.0|English is my second language and even I couldn't bear how horrible both the writing and the story was. I was about half way through and then realized I just can't keep punishing myself and just read the ending. Oh, and that was horrible too! I am not going to go into the details, but just read all 1 star reviews and I agree with all of them for all the same reasons. I am going to remember the name of the author so that I never ever buy her books.<br />Ps - I never write reviews on anything, but this was so bad I just needed to do this. I wish I never bought any of \\"Fifty...\\" books
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a very cute game. It is geared towards kids (I am a kid at heart). I like the quality of graphic design. The fish are cute and so are various plants.<br />Parents will definitely want to block the in app purchasing.  Many of the &quot;homework&quot; assignments really can't be done on time without using pearls( these require real money mostly). You can earn them, but its slow going, and most children probably won't have the patience to wait.<br />I am playing it on my Kindle Fire HD. It runs smooth for the most part. I am playing the free part of the game. I doubt  I'll buy  this game when the free trial is over. I can't complete the goals on time, as I won't pay over and over to get the pearls.<br />So parents be sure to block in app purchasing, or else you will not be happy with the credit card bill!<br />This would be better if developer made it easier to purchase the pearls with sand dollars the player earn as they grow plants. If this were the case, I would purchase this game in a heart beat.
B008RKKUZ0|5.0|What a joy to see the movies that I loved as kid become one of my daughters favorites! Great movie!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am a Forever Fan of Downton Abbey and this is one of My Most Favorite Series! I chose this rating because this type of drama series is set in a time I am more than partial to. I love every aspect about the double dramatic, and romantic turns in the lives of both the upstairs household Downton Abbey family members and the downstairs household staff members of Downton Abbey. This series continues to surprise, and keep your interest from one episode to the next. I would recommend this product to any dramatic series enthusiast because it will surely not disappoint. The only thing that may be a little disappointing is the once you fall in love with the actors, they prosper on to more acting roles in other genres and are killed off the show; but the show in itself is EXCELLENT. I am anxiously awaiting the next installment Season (4) as Downton Abbey progresses into the ROARING 20s!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love season 3 the best -so many twists and extra  adventures that had me on the edge of my seat!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play it all the time its soooooo fun its one of the best games ever I am always on this game
B0012GMZ4U|5.0|Je m'appelle Barbra (1966) is the eighth studio album released by Barbra Streisand. She sings much of the album in French and she speaks French like a true native it's unbelievable. There two types of recordings one in English and the other in French there where so many songs recorded they couldn't put it all in one album. So if you love french this is an album for you.
B00005JO9J|2.0|Watch one episode and you have seen them all.  Boring and predictable.  Everyone will sleep with everyone.  Such a waste of life.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a really great book I loved it! I would highly recommend this book and it's totally worth the money!!! I really enjoyed this book and if you  buy it I hope you do to!!!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Loved this book, very real despite how unlikely it might seem. All human nature, the good, the bad and the downright ugly is contained in this gem of a book. 'Harold - you rock!'
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's very intertaining and addictive too!  I love to play the different facetsof it. Same game in different versions ,love it!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The movie was a very good adaptation of the book and it had excellent computer animation. Quite an enjoyable movie
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Even though it's not a classic for my generation, it should be. Not just another teen drama. The characters are wonderfully written and acted. I adore this movie. &#60;3
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The lighthearted banjo music makes an eerie feeling of being trapped like a lab rat an enjoyable caper. Your kidnapper must be a kindly grandmother type, eager to be understood, since the high-tech security system she employs to keep you confined is easily hackable from environmental clues. Fun for your inner escapee!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Both puzzling and fun!! It's great!!! Very challenging at some points but that's the point! A great mind game to keep any one entertained
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I was recently turned on to Beth from my daughter. This is very enjoyable. Joe Bonamassa's sound is incredible. My fave is I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Its a dictionary, just a dictionary. What else should I say? Ummm its a, nice dictionary? And, it uhhh helpful?
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Even after all these seasons, Dexter never fails to send chills down my back.  The writers are inventive and dark, the villains menacing, and the emotional turmoil tormenting for both Dexter and Deb Morgan. These characters are complex and constantly evolving. Great TV viewing, no doubt about it.
0425263924|5.0|I absolutely loved it! The ending was kinda crazy but knowing there will be a fourth book makes it all worth it!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I was a little lost when season two started without two of the main characters but otherwise a good story line
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The story was fair and accurate as an account of what happened by the people who actually carried out the mission.  It was not a glamorous mission but a job that had to be done.
B0091R30MS|5.0|Outstanding history of Chinese discovery which has altered my view of conventional history. Thoroughly researched and a beautifully written book on this little known period.
B001EBWING|5.0|Classic that never fails to deliver fun, romance, and entertainment on multiple levels. Impossible to remake as the best possible writers were lost during the last writers strike.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is awesome. I would definitely tell all my friends about it!!! Thx all lot for reading
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love the Fringe series  I wish it was still on. I love the actors in it. Power full stuff. The story line is great.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|There were multiple issues in getting Kindle for Android installed on my device.  The Amazon store's instructions were unhelpful and failed to point out that the order in which registering the Android device, downloading the app, configuring the device with my Amazon account settings and (hopefully) receiving the content I paid for were to be performed.  This took more than an hour and two calls to tech support, the second of which had to be escalated internally.  Kindle device names, against all logic and convention, must start with a capital letter even though the web site will allow non-cap first letters.  My Android insisted that it was my third Android when I had clearly registered it as my base unit on the web site.  This was all complicated by Amazon's unfortunate habit of defaulting purchases to the wrong payment method, despite multiple attempts to update the account on the web site.  I finally had to delete and re-add my payment methods.<br /><br />Now lets talk about the reader.  Kindle app is full of suggestions but not full of features.  There is no way to configure tap zones to allow allow one handed page advance.  The volume control can be used, but the reach up and back to the volume control for every page is uncomfortable and unnecessary.  Other apps can do this, why not Kindle?  There appear to be no Settings options to configure font type, brightness (controlled only by device if on \\"auto\\"), automatic scrolling or other commonly available features.  I am unwilling to use the font the publisher elects if I can avoid it, especially if it is Times Roman or most other common serif fonts.<br /><br />Kindle and Android - not a good fit or good experience.  Android is about choice, Kindle is about \\"have it our way, not yours\\".  As soon as I finish with the manual I purchased, I will likely never use the app on any platform again.  Amazon bought out a rival e-book reader app, Stanza, and effectively killed or crippled it on iOS.  Kindle app would have been really useful if Stanza reading and use features had been engineered into its kernel.n really useful if Stanza reading and use features had been engineered into its kernel.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|The most outstanding movie I have ever seen. The action is real, the acting is real and it took a man who can ride a thousand miles on a high performance dirt bike through the Baja desert and survive intact to have the courage and character to make a move about courage and character. The Navy trained them but god made them special. I would recommend this movie to any patriot. Thank you Mouse McCoy and all the Navy Seals.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Imwas looking forward to wrapping up the Sookie Stackhouse saga with a happy ending. This book was a joke. It was if the author gave up and just pretended to care about the characters we have come to know and love. Don't waste your money. You'll be as mad as I was when I was done.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great free game must have time waster the kids will love this one to. Starts off east then gets progressively harder the more you make it into the game.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Great sequel, a very worthy successor, well written, excellent direction, fantastic special effects. Great family movie. I hope they continue on.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few years. Don't worry about the speed... Embrace the power and immortality of your boat!<br /><br />It's always been a challenge to drive. In time, you get used to it. I purchased this game from play a few years ago when they were selling groups of apps priced at $.10. This was one.<br /><br />Definitely polished and worth $.99 for sure! Gameplay is fast, sounds and storyline are great. Kills time and you can pick up where you left off.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This kept my son busy for hours during a rainy evening. Great app! I hope to see many more levels!
B00D7NRHX0|5.0|I loved this movie! The photography was amazing and the story was a unique twist on &#34;star&#34;-crossed love. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys love stories and sci-fi.
B00881VLCE|5.0|As an avid jigsaw fanatic I was not expecting a digital puzzle that would hold My attention. Of course it's not the 1000-2500 piece l'm use to, but then again I don't have to hog a table, pick pieces off the floor or threaten everyone (joke) in the house when it gets tipped with three pieces to go.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Nice season...started slow, built to a nice finish.  Can't wait to see how they can build it up for season 4
B003O86FMW|5.0|The title says it all... Suzanne Collins is amazing and so are her books &#62;_&#60; Also finally some Gale/Katniss moments + an unexpected twist for those who haven't read it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book!!!  I couldn't put it down.  It's ironic, because I didn't really like the movie that much.  There was just too much hype.  Now I'm going to have to watch the movie again.  The author's ideas were really easy to follow.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I like the fact I can see how much battery power I have left. With 4 people using my Kindle it really helps.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|Not saying that every movie a star puts out there is going to be a piece of gold but for awhile there it seemed like Nicolas Cage could add a fart in a movie and bump the review up a point. Then things started to slide, the weird-er roles started popping up and had personally lost hope that his bad-assdom would fade. Drive Angry brings his gritty, &#34;I could give a s***&#34; attitude back to the silver screen. Awesome action, corny but not over the top action storyline, hot co-actress in Amber Heard, and last but not least, Nick Cage. Enjoy fellow movie lovers...
B005MLOKXA|4.0|This series keeps you interested.  Good casting of characters.  Look forward to the repeat special guests, especially Michael J. Fox.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really enjoy the show and finding it on Amazon Prime!  Drama and depth of characters keeps me coming back for more.

B000I9VOO4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies (and books) of all time. Unlike a lot of folks, I didn't read this book in high school, but later in life in a period when I was reading many of the \\"classics\\". The book was excellent and the movie is true to the book in both story and nuance. The story is so well told from Scout's eyes. Gregory Peck, in the role of Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is outstanding -- in fact, I can't think of anything I would change about this movie.  Even the minimal (essentially non-speaking) portrayal of Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley by a young Robert Duvall is special. What brings me to to tears in this movie is the amazing love that Scout and Gem share ... if you've ever grown up with an older brother or sister you will feel the same. Thank you Harper Lee -- and the director, producer and actors in this film -- for a truly inspiring, poignant story.
140123769X|5.0|I have been a fan of Willingham since his days with Comico writing the Elements. In my opinion Fables are his best work. The man has created new worlds for us to explore. Buy this book and his other Fables books. They are all great reads.

0062255657|5.0|Niel Gaiman is modern fantasy. You can't get away from that. He is as important to fantasy as J.R.R. Tolkien was in the beginning. American Gods was one of the most innovative fantasy books to come along in a long time, beaten only recently by The Drowning Girl, and of course now, by The Ocean at the End of the Lane.<br /><br />What's this book about? In a word, childhood. In a few more words, it's a semiautobiographical tale of growing up in England oppressed by parental figures and life in general. There are hints of Alice in Wonderland, and, bizarrely for Gaiman, hints of a Miyazaki film, Spirited Away especially came to mind when I read it. The novel is wondrous and well-contained and has a wallop of an ending, which you'll have to read to find out.<br /><br />A warning about this book: It's short. It's basically a novella. Not even 200 pages long. Now, that's not a bad thing. American Gods if anything was too long and winding. This book is much tighter, much more exquisite. Gaiman retains his voice while peeling away the excess.<br /><br />But its shortness and its subject make this a new kind of fantasy. We are seeing the field move away from Game of Thrones length work, and from epic fantasy settings. The field is becoming more interesting, and more welcoming than ever before.<br /><br />And that's the best thing about this book, and why it may be Gaiman's best yet. It's a great place to get into fantasy if you've never read any. And it's a great place to get into the rest of Gaiman's work, which is significant and worth reading.

1589795474|4.0|We bought this book for our 14 year old grandson.  He is a math geek and this book has lots of surveys, tables, charts and graphs.  It differentiates between accumulating wealth and squandering money.  Since most teenagers think millionaires are rock stars or athletes it shows a different perspective of a millionaire lifestyle.  It is filled with surprising facts.  I enjoyed reading it first and hope that he gets lots out of it.

B00C061I3K|4.0|A lot of people were giving this album a bad rap before I received my copy from Amazon. I like it because it has a very '80's sound to it that is distinctly different to their previous offering &#34;Human After All&#34; which I listened to in the car the other day for the first time in a while to make a comparison.<br /><br />I think it's a closer sound to the Discovery album which also had a very commercial sound to it and I absolutely loved that one.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Sure, the title of this review's a bit dramatic, but can anybody remember a band so forgotten, so left for dead (Justifiably so.), so completely irrelevant, that has returned with the impact of Queensryche with this new album, earning universally rave reviews and flying off store and online shelves? By now I'm sure we all know the backstory of the drama and incredibly messy split this band had with it's now former singer Geoff Tate, who's currently fronting a band of hired guns using the name Queensryche, sparking a debate of which side deserves the name, which he'll now have to surrender at a court date in November. That debate is now officially over with the release of this album. Mr. Tate, you are guilty as charged. (Oh, Mr. Tate, your comment about the very sparse sales of your fake Queensryche album, that \\"Nobody buys CD's anymore.\\", apparently it's just YOUR CD nobody's buying.) As a longtime fan, I really missed all the things that made me love this band from the beginning, the same things I think most of us fans had given up on considering the drivel they've put out over the past 15 years. With this release it's crystal clear that the now former singer is indeed guilty of all the tyrancy, Machiavellian manipulation, and eliminating the creativity and input of the other 4 members he's been accused of. Just the fact that founding members Michael Wilton (Guitar), Eddie Jackson (Bass), and Scott Rockenfield (Drums), along with relatively recent addition Parker Lundgren (Guitar) could perservere through all of Tate's garbage, then all the drama surrounding the split, to do so with class and integrity, and then put out an album so strong, so brilliant, is nothing short of miraculous.<br /><br />  Obviously the big story of this album is new singer Todd La Torre. Tate in his prime was one of the greatest vocalists in music, so the shoes La Torre had to fill were indeed enormous. Fill them he does, and then some! He cites Tate as an influence, so at times he does have a bit of Tate's phrasing and nuances. Also, he needs to have some similarities to Tate to make the classic material sound good live. However, make no mistake La Torre is far more than the Tate clone he's been referred to. He has a delivery all his own, and his range is better than Tate's, as he's much better and with better clarity when singing in the lower registers of his voice. He is truly the story of this album, because the vocals are a highlight on every single song. But besides just his incredible voice and his songwriting, he's brought (Along with Lundgren, in a lesser role.) the new energy that reinvigorated a band that was all but forgotten. The album opens in once-typical Queensryche fashion with the brooding instrumental 'X2', which leads seamlessly into the first song 'Where dreams go to die'. One of the songs released prior to the album, 'WDGTD' is the first Queensryche song to actually sound like Queensryche in 15 years. Before La Torre even opens his mouth the twin guitar harmonies that were such a staple of this band immediately grab you and don't let go for the remainder of the album. La Torre enters with an understated but stellar performance, but it's Jackson and Rockenfield that stand out, staking their claim that the signature Queensryche sound was certainly not the voice of the former singer. It was well publicized that Tate stated in an interview that he really didn't know what the signature Queensryche sound was, well it's clear that Lundgren, the youngest and second newest member of the band certainly does. 'WDGTD', a classic Queensryche song that would fit on any of their classic albums, was written by Lundgren. 'Spore' is a great melodic heavy song that sees La Torre unleashing his voice a bit more than on the opener and sounds relevant in today's music scene but is still instantly recognizable as Queensryche. 'In this light' is up next, and it is one of the finest songs Queensryche has ever done. A beautiful melody, a brilliant vocalby La Torre that Tate only wishes he could sing, heavy enough guitars to resemble European symphonic metal, and a driving groove by Jackson and Rockenfield. For me, 'In this light' is the real rebirth of this band and one of the highlights of an already timeless album. Should be a huge single, but won't be except on satellite radio. 'Redemption' and 'Vindication' are, again, classic heavy Queensryche songs full of guitar harmonies and soaring vocals by La Torre. Rockenfield is on fire on these 2 songs, as he is on the entire album. His playing on this album is the perfect example of the band's rebirth. After a very dark instrumental lead-in, 'A World Without' takes you on an emotional, dark, brooding tale of loss. All 4 band members turn in absolutely perfect performances that portray the song's sad, dark tone. La Torre is again absolutely BRILLIANT! His performance perfectly conveys the desperate, angry, confused, lost mood of the lyrics. It's a vocal performance Tate even in his prime never delivered. 'Don't look back' sees Rockenfield and Jackson unleash a groove that never lets up, while 'Fallout' sees Wilton and Lundgren trading riffs that would be at home on the band's masterpiece \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\". It also has the biggest chorus of the album. 'Fallout' is the other song that should be a hit, and hopefully will get a ton of airplay on satellite radio. The album closes PREFECTLY with 'Open Road', an introspective heavy ballad that really showcases the songwriting and musical virtuosity of all 5 bandmembers and finds La Torre turning in his best singing of the album. Hard for me to decide whether 'In this light' or 'Open road' is my favourite song on the album, but both are absolute classics, and it's a nice change from the recent Queensryche releases where the question always seemed to be 'OK, which song sucks the least?'<br /><br />  It's somewhat hard to believe that every single question about this album before it's release was answered so resoundingly. La Torre makes it hard to believe there was ever another singer in this band. The songwriting by all 5 members, which Tate claims was 81% his work during his tenure, is so strong and consistant through the entire album. Lundgren, who was invited by Tate to follow him upon his firing but decided to stay with the REAL Queensryche, works in sync so well with Wilton he makes you forget Chris DeGarmo. Jackson's Bass rumbles perfectly on every song and he's as good as ever. Scott Rockenfield reminds us he was a HUGE part of what Queensryche was, reaffirming his spot among Hard Rock/Metal's best drummers. THIS IS QUEENSRYCHE. This is the Queensryche of the early/glory days, yet it's what Queensryche should sound like in in 2013. After all these 5 guys have been through, it was really hard to not root for them. They've been very active on social media sites, PERSONALLY responding to and answering any and all questions, despite what I'm sure was a very hectic schedule leading up to the album release. La Torre's character is well documented at this point, and if you're not happy for him you may not have a Heart. Besides all that, this album is great because of the music. There's not a single song on here you want to skip and certainly nothing that can be called filler. One of the complaints about this album is it's just over 35 minute length. I honestly have no problem with that. In today's world we all have jobs and lives, so listening to complete albums start to finish is rare. Rush's \\"Clockwork Angels\\" was one of 2012's best albums, it clocks in at around 70 minutes, and as such it's hard to listen to from start to finish. This album is all quality, which makes it's smaller quantity all that much more enjoyable. The deluxe version includes 3 live tracks of classic Queensryche songs. La Torre just KILLS on these, and the tracks are such a far cry from the embarrassing remakes Tate offers on his fake Queensryche album that nothing more needs said. Also, I understand it's mastered a bit loud, but all the instruments can still be heard clearly, and La Torre's voice is Golden on every track. Honestly, did any of us really expect this? This is the best Queensryche album since \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\". Yes I said it, it's better than \\"Empire\\". It's heavier, the songs are a lot more interesting, and La Torre brings a completely different vibe, that of the rebirth of a band long left for dead. Lundgren also deserves credit for that vibe, as he was a big fan, like La Torre, before joining the band. If you were ever a Queensryche fan (Before the Tate takeover) buy this album. It will remind you why you loved this band. If you are a fan of Hard Rock/Metal, buy this album. It's a statement of how good the genre can be when everything works. If you've never heard of Queensryche, like my Son who is now completely in love with this album, buy this album. It's great songwriting, great musicianship, it's just plain great music. This is a Desert Island album, an album that will always make you remember how you felt the first time you heard it.

B00004CZPF|4.0|Being that Mike Oldfield concerts are a rarity in Australia, I'm glad that I can get a chance to see two of my favourite albums played &#34;live&#34;' right in the comfort of my home. I only have one other 2 sided DVD in my collection so it's a bit odd to think this is still done.
B00C55EW7K|5.0|Great group, stellar vocals, amazing songs and completely worth the extra money for the delux edition. Big fan of this group!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|At times, God will use a movie such as this to remind of us who we are in Christ.  He did so here.  The spouse and kids need to watch this and build from it.  I know we did.
B003UBTX7C|2.0|it felt like things were added to the book just to make the book longer. Did not enjoy it very much!
B008KE3960|5.0|It is a good game. You can buy airplanes. They shoot bullets at the tanks. The airplanes look awesome. The levels look awesome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is my favorite out of the series, in gOblet of Fire kind of way. It has so much action, the plot line is accelerating at a constant rate, and we get a chance to know the characters in a much deeper way. Wonderfully exciting read.
B00004RYZT|2.0|Rammstein is arguably the greatest live concert experience on the planet.  The band's performances here are awesome indeed...but having said that:<br /><br />Regarding this video release (recorded over two nights in Berlin), the split-second cutting between the cameras is INTENSELY irritating, to the point of being unwatchable.<br /><br />C'mon, folks....let us SEE the performance without sending us into an epileptic fit! Is it really THAT terrible to linger 6 or 8 seconds on a single﻿ camera shot?!?<br /><br />A CLASSIC example of why I actually prefer audience-recorded videos posted on YouTube to the official releases. The audio of the audience recordings is often poor, but at least I can watch the performance without going into seizures!<br /><br />I have the same complaint with most of the official concert video releases of many of my favorite artists....Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones included.  The \\"strobe-light\\" effect of the camera changes is IMMENSELY disconcerting.  Get your act together, people!!

B004EPYZUS|5.0|Nery.....<br />I had seen it in theatres, but still worth watching it again, and again on dvd. I totally recommend it, excellent.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It rules the boys in my class play it all the time and i have downlaoded ot three times cause i<br />beat it
B006LSZECO|2.0|I know its a best seller, but I was put off by the back and forth style between the husband and missing wife.
1439156816|5.0|The author's frankness and down-to-earth applications make this book a refreshing must-read for anyone bitten by the writing bug.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase and engaging read.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I enjoyed what I got to see of it. It stopped in the middle and I couldn't figure out how to make it continue. This has happened before.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again, this time weaving a middle-eastern tale told by a father to his children into the masterful unfolding of the plot line.  Be prepared to go back and re-read periodically, because the story is complex and is told through the eyes of the various characters.  Yet each re-reading is well worth the investment.  The richness of the story, with its exploration of the motivations and heartbreaking decisions of the characters, deepens the reader's understanding of human nature, relationship, and the effect of culture on one's world view.  Khaled has done much to promote understanding of Afghan culture, as well as explore the passions and heartaches that resonate with people all over the world.  His characters and situations are unique, yet universal.  Unforgettable.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I fully intended to order the Blu-ray edition.  This was a rare DVD/Blu-ray who's description in terms of online packaging that was terrible, call it confusing or misleading.  Unfortunately, it got opened before I saw that it wasn't Blu-ray or I would have returned it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The Boy is a fan of GoT and made me watch some of season 1.  Lo and behold, I was hooked in two episodes, devoured season 1 over a single weekend and bought this Blu-Ray for him.  :)  For both of us ;).
B007EECSFA|3.0|Too wordy, but a good plot. Mediocre Kate Morton, an author I like alot. Lots of interesting characters, but the whole plot took too long to unwind. Great ending though.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Music - amazing!<br />Dancing - awesome!<br />Characters - hilarious and fabulous!<br />Plot - eh...<br />Conflict - a little high schoolish...<br />Overall - MUST REWATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.<br /><br />The wit and humor in Pitch Perfect is wonderful and to die for.  I love it to death.  I could not stop cracking up the first time I watched it and I'm pretty sure anyone looking over at me saw a grin on my face through the ENTIRE movie!!!!  I went with a feminist girl-friend, my boyfriend (who was somewhat reluctant) and all 3 of us LOVED the movie.  Yes, even the boy, who was pretty reluctant.  To sum up, he told his best friend, &#34;It's not a movie i would've chosen but it was really good.&#34;  :)  I actually saw it again in theatres a second time with another friend, who I needed to convert to the Pitch Perfect cult.  :D<br /><br />I bought this as soon as it came out because I needed to rewatch it ASAP.
B003E8P9G0|3.0|It's definitely a young adult book, but has some interesting mythological information.  The most annoying part for me was how the two protagonists would snipe at each other in their &#34;recordings.&#34;
B004G600A4|4.0|I like movies that show stronger sheroes/heroines so I got this for my elementary-school age cousin as a Christmas present.  I'm not sure how she enjoyed it as we don't keep in touch much.  I know my 12-year old cousin did enjoy Tangled a lot.  I personally thought the music was great and catchy (I ended up buying the soundtrack for myself on itunes).  The ending kind of bugged me, but only a little.  Otherwise, I love that the protagonist is feisty, strong, and brave, despite the fact she has no social experience outside of the interaction with her pet and her &#34;mother&#34;.
B000002L68|4.0|Relax, I'm not going to diss Prince, except to say that mostly I have no use for him and his decidedly self-contained universe. But a great song and performance is still a great song and performance, and with the title track from PURPLE RAIN Prince knocks it out of the park. Everything about this song holds ones' attention for the 9+ minutes it's on, from the artist's most emotional soul-to-soul singing to date, to the gospel feel of the chorus, to some of the best solo guitar spotlighting this side of Jimmy Page's solo in \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" Whole thing is a knockout and holds up even 29 years after its release.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, I know....what about \\"When Doves Cry,\\" what about \\"Let's Go Crazy,\\" what about the rest of this album/movie soundtrack? \\"What about it\\" is that if it floats yer boat, yer welcome to it. Me, when I want as sublime a song as any by artists I'm more committed to, \\"Purple Rain\\" fills AND surpasses the bill...and if Prince hasn't quite equalled it in the 29 years since it was first heard, it doesn't really matter. It's rightly considered a classic.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I liked the characterization and development in this film, but I liked this film least of the 3 in the trilogy.
B008ROG1QI|5.0|I love this movie! one of the greatest war movies ever. Really a great movie with tons of surprising stars in it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers is wonderful, with the characters really being rounded out and richly developed thanks to Joss Whedon's delicate (or witty) touch.  The cast is lovely and I love each and every one of the characters thanks to the way the actors portrayed them.<br /><br />There are humorous parts that were comedically pulled off with great timing.  The subtle wit and sarcasm Whedon builds in are very classic Whedon so that was nice and comforting to see.  They also help make the movie extra great.  I saw this twice in the theaters and bought the dvd as soon as it came out.  :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great little game and am sorry it's over.  Am anxiously awaiting for more levels.  Level 10 was a bit difficult but I finally got it.  :)

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't understand why the book had to become great toward the end. It's not great like the first book. But no book is great like the first one. I can't wait for the next book. I was dying for something to happen to Eva like it did for Ana in 50 Shades of Grey. But I guess it's not going to happen yet. Although the book was good, it wasn't worth the wait. It sucked that towards the end, everything wanted to get juicy with Cary possibly becoming a dad, Eva's sex tape, Gideon ex showing up to the picture and much more. The highlight of this book is when Eva found out her parents had sex. I hope I am not waiting a year for the next book to come out.
B00005B1W7|5.0|I watched this when it aired years ago and own the videotape - and now the dvd. I think it is well done and doesn't whitewash the hero who is a Jew in denial. He brings a lot of sorrow to his family and to himself - but at the same time brings out the shame and awfulness of the Nazi regime and one of their doctors who in the present day refuses to admit how corrupt and evil he was and therefore, still is.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie was amazing I absolutely loved it and so did the kids. Disney is simply the best at recreating this enchanted fairytale.

B009O2XY12|2.0|At first this seemed like a fun game. But as I attempted to go to higher levels, I started to have problems. I reached a level that I had to give up on. I was unable to determine what the goal of that level was. How can you achieve a goal when you have no idea what it's supposed to be? So I had to uninstall and give up. Too bad, it started out as so much fun.

B00C3MKCIS|5.0|For me there have been a small number of debut albums that qualified as &#34;must-buys&#34;.  Toto and Boston are the first that come to mind.  Bruce Hornsby & The Range is another.  Sound Of Contact's debut entry definitely ranks up there.  From the opening notes of &#34;Sound Of Contact&#34; through &#34;M&ouml;bius Slip&#34;, we are taken on an incredible journey.  Yes, Simon Collins is Phil's son, and yes, you can hear Phil's &#34;sound&#34; in Simon's drumming and vocals, but this is about much much more than that.  I invite you all to listen in and enjoy Dimensionaut as much as I do.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This was more interactive than others we tried. She said there was more to do with their hair than the other app with the princesses.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Nice to see a smartly written show featuring actual grownups (even the kids seem to have good heads on their shoulders), and in particular a highly capable and very human female lead who's a pro but not a barracuda. It's one of the few network TV offerings I make it a point to watch because it's believable, interesting, relevant, and not sickeningly violent and sadistic (like Game of Thrones - do millions of people really like watching prolonged scenes of physical torture and listening to agonized screams? If so, why? Are they demented? I don't get it).
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I've been playing this game for like a month already and it's really fun. When you first started its difficult and kinda boring. Other then that the is awesome

B000FCK65W|5.0|Well written story. This is a very visual book.  The main character holds your interest as you see her life and environment unfold.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It's a very good movie, the only problem I found is that it contains too many death and some of them are really illogical!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This album is very good.  It is probably AIC's most complete album since 'Dirt.' Every song on the album is good. Some of the songs are great. The rest fall somewhere in between. It is that good.<br /><br />I agree with what I've seen many others mention, that this album is a grower. The more you listen to it the more you appreciate it.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|Deafheaven and Explosions in the sky made love and had a baby. that's truly the only way i can describe it. i am in love with this album, i bought the physically copy and i only do that once in a great while and this album deserved it. Black metal? check. Atmosphereic rock? Check. Shoe gaze? Check. and wa la you have Deafheaven. i know most people will consider this hipster black metal, or that it's ruining the black metal scene but as another reviewer posted who cares it's about the music and good tunes are good tunes. Do yourself a favor, quit reading these reviews and buy it already. you can thank all the reviewers later.

B00CHRB9RM|3.0|Boy, I purchased this deluxe CD set with great anticipation.  Already well-discussed elsewhere - the re-mixing of the original album (CD 1) is not the best at all - to me really lacks warmth.  The original album I bought on vinyl in 1973 and remember playing it for a group of fellow geology field camp students who took a weekend to escape Saltville, Virginia to visit Blacksburg and camped out in my apartment living room floor - i played that album and everyone just loved it.  That album (CD 1) is only 43 minutes long (more or less) - and should have been filled out with at least 30 minutes more from the sessions.  For example, in the booklet the song Jelly Jelly is described as including an instrumental jam out which was cut off for lack of room on the vinyl album - well put it back as an intact recording on CD 1.  The unreleased tracks (CD 2) are interesting and I personally liked this CD - but it is not essential (no earth shattering revelations).  The live show (CD's 3 and 4) from the Winterland in September, 1973 is very good and enjoyable.  Because to me, the price for this 4-CD set is very reasonable - and despite the problems - is well worth purchasing. Would be nice if CD 1 could be re-released with some nice filler material.  I hope that somehow in the future - Idlewild South is revisited and treated in this same manner - i.e. unreleased tracks and outtakes from the sessions - plus add on an unreleased show from 1971.  Gregg Allman's first solo album Laid Back also deserves deluxe box attention as does Richard Betts Highway Call.  I sure hope these come to fruition in the next year or two as well I'm getting old (as like all those original fans from those fabulous days gone by).
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book changed my life in so many ways:) The author has great insight. Awesome read,I'd recommend it to everyone.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|Typical Pink!! She never disappoints. This album is a combination of love, life and fun .. My favorite song is Try.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy this look back at how people lived and interacted with their servants.  My husband was into watching too.
B00BSO2U1Y|3.0|This is a very thought provoking recording with some very serious flaws.  This is a demanding recording that is a challenge to review and assimulate.  First off I must say I love the opera Norma and consider it a masterpiece.  I have sung in the chorus of it with Pittsburgh Opera and have truly studied it. I also have more than 20 recordings and DVDs of it from Callas to Cigna, Cerquetti, Milanov, Verrett and even Elinor Ross and Gwyneth Jones.  It is one my favorite operas and I truly looked forward to this performance.  I am a bit disappointed; but not totally.  As for the review here goes:<br />1) I truly love parts of it and strongly dislike other parts of it. WHY?????<br />2) I DO NOT LIKE THE TEMPI AND CONDUCTING most of the time.  I feel the conductor sees this score \\"in extremis.\\"  All accents are massive; almost like early Rene Jacobs in his earliest Handel recordings.  He, Jacobs, got so much better with some experience in the Theater.  Dynamics are also in the extreme.  In fact, they would not work on the old LPS.  TOO LOUD AND ALSO TOO SOFT! Boy oh boy did that needle jump that groove.  Tempi are also \\"in extremis\\" most times just way too fast.  Much of the military march music becomes banal at these speeds.  In fact, the wonderful overture just \\"rump puh pums\\" along and sounds like the \\"William Tell Overture\\" not Bellini.  In truth these tempi are more in line with Rossini singing than Bellini.  Where are some of the long arches of Bellinian melody.  In this conductor's hands these great melodies often just speed by as in a race; also, great accompaniments often are destroyed by his excessive speeds.  There are times I felt I had fallen into the wrong opera - IL TROVATORE, and sometimes the \\"Anvil Chorus.\\"  Downbeats are also at times distorted by constant massive accents.<br />3) No matter how you try to justify it in the treatise presented in the accompaning booklet; there seems to be an air of wanting to justify some real problems in casting and interpretive decisions. It seems to be a PR product because they knew they had a problem performance on their hands.  I can see in my mind's eye the PR department, Bartoli and the Conductor Antonini getting together and writing this justification of all the weaknesses of this ensemble, interpretation and recording.  The question being: \\"how do we save this expensive project?\\"<br />4) John Osborn is a mistake in casting.  His lyric moments are nice; however, he pushes his lyric instrument to the extreme in music like \\"Me protegge, me difende.\\"  He tries to be Corelli or Del Monaco and fails abysmally.<br />5) Michele Pertusi is not in best voice and is overparted by Oroveso's high notes.<br />6) Sumi Jo is an excellent Soprano and young sounding Adalgisa.<br />7) I am a Bartoli fan especially in Rossini; however. not in Bellini.  The entire notes to this production seem no more to me than a poor justification for her vocal limitations in this role than a true piece of scholarship.  Her voice and interpretation just seem too bottled up most of the time.  The mike seems most of the time way too close; almost down her throat!  I expected great things and am somewhat disappointed!  I believe her forays into Soprano repertoire have changed the center of her voice and not for the better.  I also \\"feel\\" this has also resulted in a limiting of her dynamic range and possibities.  This is just a feeling and I could be very wrong.  Her best days may be coming to an end???  I will give her credit though for some very lovely lyric moments.  The big dramatic moments are just not there.<br />8) The chosen ornamentation of Bartoli and Osborn doesn't always work and sometimes sound like mistakes or out of tune singing.  He is very bad in this in his First Act aria and cabaletta.<br />9) I don't like the period orchestra in this opera; especially the long flute soli introductions.  Also , I don't feel that the \\"Baroque\\" straight string tone works in Bellini.  Why do the singers use vibrato then???<br />10) In general a bold experiment that doesn't seem to be a sucess.  I don't think this is how Bellini first heard it. I do not believe the orchestra of his day could have played at some of these tempi.  Todays orchestral musicians are virtuosi!<br />11) I tend to dislike the First Act very much and enjoy the Second Act more except for the Finale.<br />12) I will listen to this again; just not too often or too soon.
B0094K1K42|1.0|I'm not sure what this movie was supposed to be?  A dark comedy?  There was nothing redeeming about it.  The thing I hated the most about it was the fact the main character didn't take care of her dog.  I almost expected her to walk into her hotel room at some point and find the little dog dead.  There is no way she could drink alcohol like a fish and eat all that fast food and look like, well, Charlize Theron.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is really an enjoyable read.  Couldn't put it down.  Enjoyed all that the book offered.  I would recommend it highly.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|So exciting n full of thrilling adventures, great way to challenge u n friends can not put it down!!!!!! Keep playing!!
B007JNWJMI|4.0|Overall I love this app! It is easy to use and has many options in adjusting the looks of your photos. There is only one aspect I wish this app the option to add text to photos. Thankfully I have another photo editing app that I use to add text. I just wish this one had it. If it did I would give it 5 stars. Only other issue is on my kindle fire some if the buttons are hard to hit because they are so close to the main menu button on the Kindle. Sometimes it takes several times to get it to register. The outer buttons are easy to hit just my the middle ones.
0812993845|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because I love the Shopaholic books so much, and I thoroughly enjoyed Kinsella's last two hardcovers.  And I'm okay with the fact that most of the heroines are a little bit dumb.  But this book went beyond annoying with the ongoing \\"how are we going to get out of this mess\\" ridiculousness.  It wasn't a fun read.  Really disappointed.  I would have MUCH preferred it if the author had spent some time on the rumored \\"Shopaholic Takes Hollywood\\" book that everyone is talking about.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This app is cute I like the look of the dragons and the ability to breed dragons so that you do not have to incursions with coins. May main dislike if the game is that hi are not given much space to begin with and expanding is REALLY expensive just to make room will take me a week or so to open up a small square, let alone the cost if the buildings on top if that.
B004UID2LC|1.0|No search feature, locked up frequently.  It was not easily navigable, either.  I deleted it pretty quickly and downloaded another app, which wasn't much better.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I can't wait to read the next book. I got. Hooked on the Game of Thrones HBO series. I had to read the books because I can't wait to know what happens to the characters
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It played continuously and I have no idea how to shut it off.  I wish I knew of another way to play youtube and search.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Took me a little time to get started but once I did, love it! Makes you look for clues and tools and figure out when to use them. Ready for more!
098478280X|5.0|This is a very good resource for an experience software developer who has been out of schools for years. It has plenty of practice problems with solutions and explanations. I would highly recommended to anyone interviewing with Microsoft or Google.
B00BESM14U|4.0|There are so many &#34;typical&#34; teen &#34;I'm not part of the crowd - watch how I deal with it&#34; films from the last 30 years but this one did set itself apart in many ways.  I truly enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I waited a few days after seeing this movie to write this review.I was a little apprehensive in seeing it even though it had rave reviews due to some content and issues brought up in the film but, I set that aside and took the plunge . I must say this movie, for me, was nothing short of a masterpiece. There is one scene where PI had to bludgeoned a fish to death and apologizing to the fish in tears for it, and that got me. The are just so many incredible moments that don't want to take away from any person who had not read any reviews  some of the unforgettable and moving moments of the film. The only adjustment I would liked to have made was perhaps to move along the beginning just a bit but other than that. I saw it in 3-D but in 3-D or 2-D It is multidimensional, incredible visuals and a moving experience.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app:) it is tricky but awesome:) it is great for the family :) good promblem solving :) get the app today :) you will not regret your decision:) it is free:)
B001EBYMB2|5.0|I've seen it MANY times and always enjoy. Probably the best rave boot camp scenes in a film. Overall one of the finest military movies that's right up there with platoons.
0385366752|1.0|This book confused me from the first paragraph. I could not follow anything and I would say that it might be a book for most women and a few men.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|His first album is very interesting, for the most part beautiful, and shows a level of professionalism that I am sure will continue with his obvious love of his art.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Hard to put down. Keeps the brain sharp with a visual challenge. My husband took game away from me so he could play.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|the only problem was the movie kept freezing up<br />otherwise it was great<br />was a fast dowload<br />would order another movie this way
193700788X|3.0|NO SPOILER REVIEW: I have read the whole 'Sookie Stackhouse' Series. I have to say: The ending wasn't HORRIBLE. But, it wasn't as epic as this had the potential to be. In the final book of this series I really feel she went back to her roots in the first book and made a decent mystery novel. Also, the murder mystery was pretty interesting and a little exciting. But, overall as a final book in a very popular series it lacked a lot. She tried to incorporate elements in this book that just didn't flow smoothly at all and there wasn't enough build up to support what she wanted to do in the end to make this the epic series finale it should be. Honestly, it felt like when she started this series she had NO idea how she wanted it to end so the end felt lack luster and just so underwhelming. But, it was just OKAY if you go into this open-minded. True Blood has better writers and I'm glad it ventured off the path of her books.  WARNING... SPOILERS IN REVIEW:  First of all, anyone who has read this series might know how I feel. But, she has made Bill and Eric such a big part of Sookie's life and wrote Sam in most (not all) of the books as a best friend type person. That was the feel I got. In the end it seemed like she tried to wrap the Eric situation up in a nice little bow and said, &#34;Well that's the end of that y'all&#34; and give her another guy in the end... The transition was NOT SMOOTH at all. There should have been more of a build up of Sam romantically throughout ALL the books because to me it felt like he was totally pushed so much nearer to the friend zone than all her other supes. She should have built it up their relationship more and not just relied on the fact that we knew he was the first supe in her life. AND... I feel that the fairy battle in one of her previous book felt like more of an epic ending than this. Bringing all the bad guys from before... the way she wrote it just still didn't feel epic enough. Copley was practically handed to her without a fight. HANDED to her. Her epic love story with Eric felt like... WTF was all that for? She didn't even end up with Bill. Forced transition to Sam (who I do like and he is a good guy, but damn... Forced much?). And that part where Bill brought the &#34;writer&#34; to Sookie's house? What was the point of that? There was no point at all to that part of the story. It could have even been edited out. It would have been the epic series it should have been and seemed like it was going to be if Sookie and that Vamp Queen battled it out with all her friends and her and Eric fought for their love which in a MAJORITY of the Sookie books it did.  Charlaine is a good writer. We've seen that in several (not all) of the Sookie Stackhouse books. But, seriously she needs to take notes from J. K. Rowling on how to write and FINISH an epic book series. She needs to learn how to have everything tied together throughout all the books (SMOOTHLY without sudden HORRIBLE transitions) and make the final book satisfy not just herself, but the fans.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|why do I have to write in this box?....anyways this movie is hilarious! it may be funnier than Borat. These other people writing reviews have no sense of humor.
B00821PCJS|5.0|What a wonderful find I wish I saw this one before. This series is like the Walking dead meets Firefly, always a good watch.
B004VFK5LO|3.0|Couldn't hear it but no options for CC - did not get through the movie. (Hear are the 5 more words required!)
0307346617|5.0|Great read so much better then the movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. It kind of shows you some responsibility of a pet. I got it today and I am already addicted to it.
B00008G9JN|4.0|Another good CD from Jethro Tull.  It always reminds me of college days, since that's when I first heard this album.  Very nice!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great and challenges your detective mentality. Looking forward to more levels of excitement. I recommend this to all adults.
B002UBRFDC|4.0|A very good book so far.  I had considered buying it in hardcover version, but it's much more portable in the Kindle version!
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|i can't watch this movie. I have 5 video programs including real player, Microsoft, quicktime, vlc player, and divx. yet I can't watch this movie without purchasing a kindle or nook whatever amazon is pushing.
B008N1LL42|3.0|Plot: To rehash every other reviewer... Humanity stupidly send out a message to space that essentially says \\"Here we are. Please invade us.\\"  The aliens say \\"Sounds fun\\".  So the aliens leap in their uber-fast, technologically awesome starships that can successfully cross the vast voids of space to find a tiny planet but which, alas, are incapable of avoiding satellites or even landing safely. Go figure. Maybe the alien engineers put all their efforts into the propulsion units and forgot about the brakes and steering. Luckily for Earth only one alien starship had a communications module that could phone home and that was the one that hit the satellite.  So the aliens must use Hawaii's radio telescopes (or whatever) for that purpose. Hawaii is then surrounded by an alien force field and the aliens send in some traffic control bots to manage the crowded local highways. Luckily three navy destroyers are inside the forcefield and one of these has a senior officer who is an arrogant screw-up with the common sense of a deranged chicken burrito thief. Watch out aliens!<br /><br />To be honest, the premise of this film excited me and even the synopsis sounded fun. The graphics were certainly magnificient. Alas this film just felt like someone in the scriptwriting department had said \\"Hey, why don't we remake both 'Top Gun' and 'War of the Worlds' in one big movie, use ships instead of planes, replace Tom Cruise with his clone, and then include some real ex-military personnel.\\" Actually, I'm glad they did include some ex-military personnel, especially the double amputee, because their acting I actually enjoyed. (NOTE: a big thumbs up to Gregory Gadson whom it is difficult not to admire).<br /><br />I give the film three stars because I did actually enjoy several parts of it, but the screenwriting just really was appalling. Watch it if you have nothing better to do with your day.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I was so looking forward to the final book, only to find that it wasn't a final book but there is another sequel to follow. I was disappointed, as it ended so abruptly. It feels to me that it is just being drawn out to make the reader buy more books. Can the authour please tie up all the loose ends in the next one.
B00371XIJE|1.0|This is one of those movies that is mislabeled as a family film. There is nothing \\"sweet\\" about it. All it does is get worse and worse. Just because it is a true story doesn't mean it is good to make a movie out of it and call it inspiring when it is not.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|funny and addictive.I love this game.once you play it you won't want to stop! its even free which makes it even better.
B000IZAHB4|1.0|The storyline was very weak. The decisions made by the main characters from the very beginning and throughout the movie made no sense at all.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I look like it was going to be dome . but it was action an really fast adventure magic ,, nice nice
0345525558|5.0|I won't go into detail retelling the story of &#34;The Language of Flowers.&#34;. There are many others who have done a fine job of that.<br />I will say that this book surprised me. I became acquainted with it because it was the selection of a book club I was considering attending.  My first thought was &#34;Is this the best they can do?&#34;. As I started to read the book however, I became intrigued by the story. As the book came to a close, I was sorry to see it end. I wanted to know more of the story.<br />In this book you will meet several interesting characters.  They are well developed and I became friends with all of them.  The author has done a good job of making the characters relatable. The story is well developed and the ending, predictable as it is, left me smiling and a little sad that it was over.  Learning about the language of flowers, their meaning and beauty, was an added bonus. I will be more careful about the flowers I choose to give someone.<br />Although I was unable to attend the book club meeting where this novel was discussed, I am grateful to the leader of the group for picking this book. Had it not been chosen, I would have missed out on this excellent novel and a great read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Tore thru this book so fast I had to read it again! Loved this book so much, can't wait to read it again
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Really user friendly and easy to navigate. Like this app better than all the rest. I recommend this app over all the other ones

B007SOQBCM|1.0|I can't watch the live streams that I'm following. It needs a sign in option and a search bar to look for streams.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing!! I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire HD and the<br />Graphics are absolutely amazing.This is a must buy app.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Interesting show... we enjoyed it a lot. First started out as a serialcomic and got slightly more serious. But really good show.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Loved it, can't wait to dive into the next one!!!<br />Wish I knew of these books sooner!<br />I need three more more words for this review.......get em
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is a lot of fun, more levels please, it is Challenging and fun, thank you!! No more words!
B00479SVBU|1.0|The device never worked with my ipod or phone.  What a waste of money. Should have sent it back, but waited too long, not I'm stuck with this crapy device that did not work as advertised
B00BSW6F26|3.0|What I love about hidden object games is that they're hard, but is there such a thing as too hard? It's always a little tricky trying to find objects under beds, in drawers, or among other items, but the creators of this game made it nearly impossible by using poor lighting and very small graphics. The result is that you will stand in a room wildly clicking everywhere hoping to get lucky and find that map piece. There's a hidden panel that took me ages to find because it's in the dark, so how are you suppose to know where to start looking or what inventory item to use on it? After a while the whole thing just got frustrating.<br /><br />A good mystery gives you all the facts and expects you to make sense of them. A poor mystery leave out key pieces of information. This mystery often relies on the player stumbling onto information out of desperation.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|I was looking forward to this show but was really disappointed.  The art direction was great and even the acting was decent.  The concept was interesting...I kept asking my husband during the show, why it was so boring and bad.  He said it is just a bad script/ bad directing.  He couldn't keep watching it.  i finished it but was just bummed.  I am really surprised that there are any good reviews of this.  Maybe a lot of teeny-boppers, or people who will like zombie movies no matter what.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I did not want to read this as I think the &#34;dog eat dog&#34; mentality of this world is ungodly.  I was surprised by other people who liked it so I gave it a shot.  The storyline snaps you up immediately.  The remnant of good in an otherwise evil society reminds me that hope springs eternal.  I think it is ok for young readers.  Maybe it will help some of them cling to what is good.  What remains in the two following books may change my mind.  We'll see.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Better than what I had, however they really could take a lesson from apple cuz it is still not as easy to deal with as it is with my apple products.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank you amazon for replacing my faulty kindle fire charger.  My kindle fire stopped charging after the warranty just expired.  I called amazon, and said they don't make the old charger, but they would replace it with the new one free of charge.  It works great.  They went above and beyond to get it to me quickly.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I was pleasently surprised. When I saw the previews this spring I wrote it off as a wait for video flick. After viewing it on amazon instant video I realized that I should have saw it at the movie theatre. Watch this movie!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It only works with Wifi, and they do not tell you to do much with this app its going to cost money.  My kid wan't really interested in it, so I deleted it.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|A very interesting and exciting story. There was mystery and action in every part of the book. I liked the way the people solved the problems they encountered during the quest. They used their past experiences to make sense of the problems they had encountered. They worked together for a common goal.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed all the levels except I had difficulty solving the math problem. Waiting for more levels, maybe has a section for hints.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|What do I have to say it's epic all so I have a old m1 Grande so that was fun
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Of course,  if you read the first three books, this is a must read. And it too is full of surprises.  But it is not a breezy reads and the prolifiration software characters make it tough to keep track.
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|Very good storyline and acting. It is my escape from long work days.  I am very hooked and interested it what happens next.
B001676320|3.0|Good blu ray of these two bands. It shows how the band members are now  but still singing their favorite hits.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|While the childhood depicted in the book is not mine, so many things evoke memories of similar things (the wanderings and secret paths of children). My ocean was a nearby lake...a place to escape to, to fish, to test homemade boats and submarines and to keep a watchful eye out for the alligator said to inhabit the place. Read this book -- now -- because your childhood awaits buried under those mundane adult memories.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's writing has changed, improved so much throughout his three books. This third book, is so much different than the first and the second. I personally think it's a masterpiece.  I can imagine and understand that some people who loved the first book may find this one disappointing, because this novel is in a whole other voice and actually a different style.<br /><br />This is a big book that is really worth reading the second time. As I said, his writing has changed so much in a very good way. This one, is more prone to reality, I think. It tells about life, real life. So many drama that I saw in the Kite Runner has gone, replaced by a sense of life carried by a gust of wind, that lingers onto your heart. Well, in life, there's not so much black and white, right or wrong, they say. I can see it in this new novel. Every character gets to speak their own voice, has their perspectives. There aren't stereotypes. And I love how the book comes together. I enjoyed it reading altogether, but when I looked at the individual life, I'm surprised at how they lived, too. Mr. Hosseini has brought the characters vividly onto the page. I love this author. I anticipate more great storytellings, or life-tellings from him in the future.<br /><br />BTW, I have the honor of meeting him during his book tour. What a nice person he is!<br /><br />Five stars, no doubt.
B0017XD3OY|2.0|You have to really like Will Smith to watch this movie, since he's basically the only actor in it except for maybe 10 minutes where other actors are allowed to appear and speak a line or two. There are a bunch of evil mutants, but they don't count as actors because they're all computer generated. Unfortunately the animation is so laughably bad that instead of being scary they're just lame. I gave it two stars instead of one though because the mannequins in it are really good.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Learned a lot about him and how to use motivation. Always think big and push yourself harder than you think you can.
B005VMSATA|4.0|The movie was great. The picture and sound were awesome. The plot was good and the action in the movie was great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This minecraft app is awesome. I love playing on it on my kindle fire but for some reason or other the other people cannot see my servers. I'm on the right WiFi and all but it doesn't show up on other devices. This has become a major annoyance. Please Help!!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The problem is that Ms. Day obviously decided after such favorable reviews for books 1 & 2 to rip apart book 3 and make 3 books out of it.  When a publisher puts the date out 6 months after an original publication date that means there was either a delay or significant re-work.  The way it ended left it obvious what happened.  This was an unimaginative way to do it.  The pace was way off and the scenes just dragged on and on unlike the first two novels.  The pace was way off.  I can tell when I'm forcing myself to finish a book.  I pre-ordered the third book after reading the 1st two books in what seemed to be a well written trilogy.  What I got was a badly written third novel that left me wondering what happened.  I kept thinking when is the writer going to start tying up loose ends only to have more plot points left hanging.  Then the ending of \\"Yes dear reader you're right this can't possibly be the end...\\"  I found this rather condescending.  I went back to Amazon after finishing the book and found out the author extended the series.<br /><br />Don't expect me to buy the other 2 books.  Don't get me wrong I loved the 1st 2 books but like Karen Marie Moning I don't buy her books any more for the same reason; she also took a trilogy and has dragged it out into 5 books with no end in sight and continually keeps adding plot points without any resolution.  There are plenty of ways to do spin off books with other characters rather than drag a book out and leave it incomplete with a trite ending phrase by the author at the end of the last chapter.  The way it was ended by the author burned me up more than anything.  If I could I would ask for my money back but I bought this on my kindle.  Had I known I could ask for my money back within 7 days, I would have.  This is a disturbing trend in novels lately and I guess I'll check the reviews before ordering and stop pre-ordering.<br /><br />If you don't believe anyone about the trilogy to whatever number it is now, do an Amazon search on Crossfire.  As of today it still comes up as a trilogy.  I bought the book ahead of time so I had no idea that the author agreed to change.  Ms. Day's assurances that she always intended to have more than 3 books rings untrue and I despise being lied to.  That is why I will not buy another Sylvia Day book or any other pseudonym she comes up with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good in fun and entertainment. I got very mad when my brother beat my high<br />Score (he's five I'm ten) it's fun to try to get high scores and I like the part<br />When you got the shoes and the rainbow flying thingy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|read the book in one day.  gives a new perspective on life.  the author  is very credible, and worthy of belief
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It worked fine at first then it just stopped playing and I've tried every thing its a great app but it doesn't work
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|Very slow and un-interesting characters. Awl erg tries to save a sinking ship but he should have read the script first before agreeing to do the picture.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was a great book that I've read over and over but this is book 4 of 4 so if you think of buying this first, you might want to reconsider. The movie goes along well and I don't see why<br />People hate on the twilight series. It is a wonderful love story with some though challenges and twists and you should defiantly read this story.
B005DJREJS|5.0|At first when I saw this show I wasn't to sure if I would enjoy this or wanna watch it ,but I decided to watch the show and ended up watching the first three seasons on the show that's available free to watch with a prime membership.This show is funny meets drama meets teen angst .It's totally awesome, the main character reminds me of Ellen Page's Juno meets My so called life's Angela chase wrapped up all in one:).I highly recommend this series.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|First of all this is not Black Sabbath.  Black Sabbath was a band.  This is album.  A couple of guys getting together to record a cd over the weekend to make some money and finding a cheap replacement for Bill Ward.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Good storyline,  refreshing movie of great quality and no special effects.  Now days thats an accomplishment.<br />Twist and turn plot
B004H4XL7E|5.0|If you sell, you need to read this book. Well explained, solid underlying theory and real examples. I've recommended to many others who have liked it equally much.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I hadn't actually heard of this Brown novel until after I'd completed his latest novel Inferno.  Full of wit, adventure, and educational fun. I am only sorry I didn't read this fabulous book earlier.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|I'm not a huge Black Sabbath expert but I like what's going on here, they got the Sabbath sound and Ozzy sounds better than I've heard in a while, keeping him in the range he can hit really paid off.  I wouldn't say there's a good punchy hit here but there are some good songs and phrases that I think will grow on me with repeated listenings.  I'm pleasantly surprised and would rate this as one of the better &#34;new music by classic rock artist&#34; albums that I've heard in a while.
B005NK69ZC|3.0|Ellen is all hilarious and this book was a very entertaining read.  I enjoyed it a lot and it makes you want to  be a better person.
B00BLDD3A4|3.0|I would definitely recommend any rock fan see the documentary which is excellent though a bit too long.  It will even give you new or more respect for Rick Springfield.<br /><br />This album, though, is more of a mixed bag.  It is not as has probably been noted elsewhere this is not a &#34;best of&#34; compilation of material that was recorded at Sound City (though that would seem to be a great, marketable idea) but new music produced once the main sound board was relocated to Dave Grohl's studio.  And the board holds up well and the music sounds great but it also takes great songs and singing to make a great album and there are probably just a handful of those here.
B004WKI204|4.0|I liked Tina Fey before and now after reading this book I LOVE HER.  It was a very funny and interesting read.
B001QJUX24|5.0|\\"The Searchers\\" was just named one of the 100 All-Time Greatest movies in the July 5/12, 2013 Entertainment Weekly magazine. And well deserved that honor is! I'd seen this movie many times but watched it again and enjoyed it just as much this time around.<br /><br />John Wayne is spectacular in some say his greatest role (I love this movie but consider Rooster Cogburn his greatest role but that's just me). Magical cinematography (I especially liked the scenes in Monument Valley), wonderful co-stars including Jeffrey Hunter, Natalie Wood, Vera Miles and Ward Bond.<br /><br />This movie came out in 1956 and is still a masterpiece after 57 years.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|It's really a great game for kids and adults. It is more fun although if you play with friends, not by yourself.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I find the kindle app for my pc and android tablet very handy.  I can read the books that I buy and find others easily and it is especially nice to be able to have it for the tablet.  I also like the fact that kindle books are usually more affordable.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Works great and its entertaining!  I have a lot of fun playing it and even got my hubby to download it
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This film goes a little far being that Ole Abe was a vampire hunter, but with it being a movie anything is possible these days. The film is cool for fans of the vamp genre or fans in need of a really tricked out scary film storyline.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|1st series was good, but this one is excellent....great job guys, please can we have more.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this series

B0094K1MH2|3.0|I didn't know what to expect as I had only heard of the movie but knew nothing of who Tintin was. It was at the least an amusing story but would definitely appeal to the younger children.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Felt kind of lost in the beginning, but the whole movie came me &#34;food&#34; for thought the I hope this behavior will never come to fruition. I enjoyed the characters and the story line.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Very fun game from the first moment you play. This game will keep you hooked love the graphics and the game play is easy.
B000FBJFSC|1.0|I enjoyed every bit of this book.  You feel the bad times and I kept hoping things would get better.  It is both sad and funny.  I  want to read this author's other books now
B004LROUW2|3.0|The title is what caught my attention. I wanted to see what this 1984 paralleled book was about. A very engrossing journey
B004KPX4W2|5.0|The characters have chemistry and work well together. Enjoyed the plot and pacing of the action. Great movie - and with Red 2 coming to theaters soon now is the time to watch the original.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really good book worth the money. It a very descriptive book. I hate reading but for this book I could just not stop
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|I thought I would like it because I am a cosmetologist, I did not, but my 3 year old & 4 year old like it.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Although it really isn't an accurate depiction of high school (characters are just a little too clever) it's a funny show.  It keeps me entertained and I like how it's run serially so it's a continuous story line.  Unfortunately these types of shows are rarely around for long because of the nature of the story lines.  But I will enjoy watching while it lasts!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great production values and fast paced multiplot narrative--acting is prime, ESP Peter Dinklage--I am hooked for certain! Still reading books--no problem.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book kept me reading wanting to know what happens next. all my friends that have read this series says that they love so it is a good book for many people with different type of gunrres that you like to read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My wife plays this game all the time. It's quite easy to end up playing this when you've got nothing to do.<br /><br />My only issue is that there are no walls on the side so your coins will fall off.  Other than that, I was surprised I play this game so much.  It's simple but quite addicting.
B000WDROYK|5.0|In the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II, a Jewish singer infiltrates the regional Gestapo headquarters for the Dutch resistance and small, courageous band of mean and women fight to the finish the Nazi atrocities. A suprise ending was unexpected<br />but instrumental in telling a beautiful love story.<br /><br />I enjoy period dramas about the World War II and how many different people it touched at depth.<br /><br />Highly recommended !
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Take a peak into early 20 Century England'  You will view lives of upstairs lords or ladies and the downstairs men and women in service.  Also, get a look at changing social and economic conditions.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I was looking for a action movie and this movie didn't let me down, I would recommend this for the action which is good and Mr. Willis, it is a typical action movie though and maybe not his best.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I was fortunate enough to attend one of the 50th Anniversary Concerts. In NYC.  I bought the Concert DVD that was later issued and it is very good but only contains less than half of the songs that were played that night. .<br /><br />This 2 CD set is over 40 songs in length and has everything we heard that night  plus songs that we're played at  shows other than the one show we attended<br /><br />The band performance and vocals are excellent , So even for a casual fan this is a great compilation of the Beach Boys songs spanning their entire career.
B000OJFV4C|3.0|Rhys Meyers doesn't make any sense as King Henry. It feels forced and uncomfortable. Most of the other actors are great and the show is pretty entertaining. However since the casting of the main character is completely wrong, it's hard to get past that...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Isn't incrediably stupid that I can't just give my stars and leave it at that?? What can of moron makes one have to write about something? Is this lower intelligence that had taken control of the machine? Oris simply a really, really group of people that sat in a board room trying to come with ways to justified their highly inflated saleries? Living in this new world of the Internet and reviews, what good are they, really, someone dribbles on and on about how this show or that song has changed their life?? I don't think so. . . . Think of it this way, the punks have taken control and we suffer! If anyone feels the same start written stumped and insane reviews like I have -- rebell against the machine!! That some like a good name for a band. . . BTW, I really like the show, which should have clear by my 5 stars!!
0307463745|5.0|This book captured many of the best suggestions, tips, and hard-learned lessons I've collected over the last few years.  Well done!
B0088NPFPQ|4.0|The films were outstanding, as I expected. The plastic pack, however, was complex and fragile. It arrived broken and has gotten worse with use.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and have been recommending it to many friends.  I could hardly  put it down. The ending, however, was a let down.  Lost a star on that basis
B005HF0GKC|5.0|This is was one of my favorite shows.  It is hard to believe with all of the reruns on cable that this is not one of them.  As a matter of fact, this is one of the great perks for me with Amazon Prime.  I  love the fact that I can stream the content to my television or simply watch on my Kindle Fire with no commercials.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show.<br />Really addicted to watching it. Good acting all around. Politics, drama, humor, some romance, this show has the gamut.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I downloaded this upon seeing the very positive reviews it was receiving on Amazon. I feel it deserves many of these reviews, but it also needs some fixes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Fun to play<br />* Smooth graphics, no slowdown<br />* Simple and effective control scheme<br />* Despite IAP being present, I found it was totally unnecessary to progress in the game (kudos to the dev for this)<br />* Good difficulty ramp-up that requires you to take advantage of vehicle upgrades<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Battery sucker - This is the single biggest problem with the game. I can play it for about 10 minutes and lose 10% of my battery. It even drains while on the charger if I am playing. This needs to be sorted out.<br />* Small number of vehicles and not enough detail is given to set each one apart from its fellows<br />* Although upgrades make an obvious difference, more detail is needed about what each one does (e.g. both 4x4 and tire upgrades claim to increase traction... why have 2 upgrades then? Explain why they are different)<br />* Maps are static creations and do not dynamically change from play to play, making the play a little repetitive<br />* Not as important, but I would like the option to remove upgrades... I found that after fully upgrading my Monster Truck, it became less effective on certain maps (maxing out suspension took me from ~250k coins per play on Moon to ~150k)<br /><br />I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game and commend the developers for making a simple and fun time-waster. None of the above cons is a dealbreaker, nor are they a dealbreaker all together, but I do have to deduct two stars for the battery usage, which is a significant problem. Aside from that, I expect to get more enjoyment out of it yet.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book, keeps you reading, I didn't want to put it down. Wanted more when it ended.  Can't wait to start the next one!  Want more of Eva and Gideon.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I often have to make quick notes and end up with bunches of little pieces of paper and post notes everywhere. This app clear all the clutter!
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Bob Marley's songs are timeless. This album is a great grouping of some of Bob's best songs. If you don't love then you need to rethink you're life.
B00D1DBO1C|2.0|Can't understand how it works.  Don't like it at all I have used Works and Aol and gmail calendars for years.  This one is not user friendly for me
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|There have been quite a few \\"Fairytale Films\\" going around lately (Jack the Giant Slayer, Snow White, etc). Some are clever. Some are charming. Still others are action adventures. This film is pure dreck with a chuckle or two thrown in.<br /><br />Is there room for dreck on the big screen? Sure! I grew up in the 50's when Sci-Fi B Movies were are the rage. Dreck can be fun.<br /><br />Here we have a hip, modern day pair of bad ass assassins for hire. It turns out that there are HUNDREDS of witches in the forrest. H & G make a good living exterminating them. It's sort of like \\"Ghost Busters on Broomsticks\\".<br /><br />The talented cast does its best with the awful script. Just hearing the sanguine siblings call each other Hansel or Gretel (\\"Hey Gretel--get ready to kick some ass\\") is silly enough to make you grimace. Now, if this whole thing had been played for laughs, it might have been halfway decent. Unfortunately, this film takes itself seriously-and that's where the Gingerbread cookie crumbles.<br /><br />This is not recommended for the little ones. The witches are First-Class scary. The oven? Forget about it!  A guaranteed nightmare for kids under 5. Wholesome family entertainment this is NOT. It is rated R.<br /><br />If you are in the mood to see a ridiculously bad popcorn flick, you will not be disappointed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game...fun to play...wish it could be played directly on Facebook using my big computer screen...easy to play and fun to play...graphics are great and believable and dinosaurs are amazing
B0054SMIH6|5.0|When the movie first began I just thought, OK another lawyer gets the bad guy off of his charges movie. Not at all!! I can usually figure out where a movie is going right away but this one had me guessing right up to the end! It is a must see!!
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Great ensemble acting!  Excellent soundtrack!  If you came of age during the late sixties or early seventies this movie is for you.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I hated the style of this book. I know a lot of people liked it, but it drove me crazy. Not a big fan, and if you are a walking dead fan, this book is nothing like the tv show.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked it but there was an awful lot of running back and forth it was close to becoming boring. Some parts were very hard while others were very easy
0307719774|5.0|I give these books as gifts and everyone loves them. I've had mine 2 yrs now and it's interesting to see how your answers either change or don't from year to year
B007JWKLMO|5.0|huge george harrison fan and this doc was worth every penny. yeah, they could have spent less time with &#34;beatle&#34; george and more on just george. you could do a 4hr doc on just that, but this was very good!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I thought with this cast this movie would rock! Although the end was touching getting there was confusing. Skip it
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|sounds great!!! i would recommend this to anyone who likes zz top!!!.... they got the mix like it should be.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I'm in true awe of John and his continued mastery of his music genre! He got the idea for this album from his wife! Pure genius with each recording and the individuals and groups he performs with! For me one highlite is the duet with Bob Seger (including Seger's keyboardist Craig Frost) PURE BLISS! John keeps on rocking! This is a CAN'T MISS ALBUM!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very nicely developed.  Challenging to capture attention of player, yet fun to figure puzzle out.  I like the way the player is challenged by nicely placed clues.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|If you set your expectations appropriately you will enjoy this movie...has enough creep to entrigue...but not enough to move it to the top of my must watch list
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, a funny light hearted love story was just what I was after and this book delivered. The main character is very likable and there's plenty of funny moments. Well written book, would definitely recommend it :)
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game really needs more levels! Its challenging but easy at the same time, definetly a game that kills time.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Abby is in college trying to escape her past, however, that seems harder to do than she realized when Travis walks into her life. Their relationship takes a dynamic turn and everything Abby thought she wanted doesn't seem to be her dream anymore.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect when I first started reading this book. Contemporary things aren't really my thing but I did enjoy the storyline. I thought the relationship between Abby and Travis was completely ridiculous though. Everything switched at a moment's notice and tempers flared at the drop of a hat. Even though I liked the concept of the story I just wasn't in love with any of the characters.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I devoured this book in two days. I love Sylvia Day. I cannot wait for the 4th installment of this series!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Good quality entertainment. Enjoyed the acting and the way they depicted Sherlock & Watson  I did wish the season was longer
1401938906|5.0|Disclaimer:  I received a free copy of the book from Hay House Inc. in exchange for my honest opinions.  All opinions remain my own.<br /><br />  So the subtitle of this book is what really caught my attention.  \\"Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality\\"...who can resist the temptation to see if this really works?!?!<br /><br />  We've all heard tales of people who dreamt of winning lottery numbers, folks who just seem to luck into everything that they could ever want, and the folks who can never seem to get a break.  Well this book explains how our thoughts, our own inner energy, can determine what will happen in our everyday lives.  And how we can have control over it.<br /><br />  We've all experienced coincidences.  This book will tell you why a coincidence isn't what it seems but more like a connection of energies between people.  Here are a couple of examples:  Mommy in GA and Mommy in PA regularly realize we had the same thing for dinner even when we never mention anything about it or even what we bought at the store.  And there are always the times, very frequently, that one of us will call the other one and they say \\"I was just going to call you\\".<br /><br />  The book has a series of 9 experiments, which if given the right amount of time per experiment, will take you approximately three weeks to complete.  I myself did most of the experiments and had about a fifty percent success rate.<br /><br />  E-Squared basically teaches you about using your own inner force to make positive outcomes in your life.  It also explains why some people have trouble succeeding because they don't believe they can.  Basically the second that you start doubting yourself you are already slowing if not completely halting your positive progress.  If you don't believe in yourself...who will?<br /><br />  I really like this book and plan on returning to it often to remind myself about the positive thinking, which by the way, has become my new favorite saying.
B004P12SSW|5.0|We liked the music. We enjoyed Christina Aguliera.  The plot was good.  I would prefer to rent it rather than buy it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I heard &#34;Crystallize&#34; on a face book link and had to find more of her music and I'm so happy I did. Her stuff is very different, sort of classical with an edge....
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this as a gift and he loved it.  The video packaging was good and the price was right!  Glad I ordered it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games in the amazon net work please get it lets see your high score<br /> Bet you wont beat mine
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I have to watch this again and again - at least every five years.  The story is solid as are the performances and the special fx still hold up.  But this movie is not effects driven and I prefer that.  I want a good story and a good time. Independence Day gives me that.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok, I love this series, but seriously, why can't these two adults just be honest with each other and tell each other the truth.  If my boyfriend refused to tell me things or he kept things from me, I wouldn't just let it go like she does in the book.  There are other things about the book that are not realistic but I can live with reading about the fantasy sex scenes. They're fun.  My husband and I get a kick out of it, I read the juicy parts to him.  We roll our eyes at each other as we're tearing each other clothes off, (kidding)
B00846REIS|4.0|Although Eva can work my nerves sometimes at her risking losing Gideon, I still like her.  She's strong and has had to and still deals with a painful, damaging past.  I think she is just right for Gideon and he is right for her.  Moving on to the continuation....
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|the seveal reviews rant and rave about calculator plus free. i downloaded to my Kindle Fire HD 7. quick. no settings can purchase. the free one has ads top of. calculator. full size. nice layout. did remove because of the ads.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is the first novel I've read for ages. I could not put it down and it was a very enjoyable read.
B000000WFZ|5.0|wonderful haunting meoldies.  I don't remember being so moved by the music when watching the movie, but then I recognized it immediately.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Quite interesting in how it progresses.  Interesting to see how they 'play' politics across the pond.  Will watch more to see how it progresses.
B000066C1N|4.0|I ordered this a few years ago for my daughter, and she really liked it, the music is original and she listened to it all summer!Good packaging and arrived on time!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I watched all the original showings of The Good Wife and I enjoyed them as much the second time around.
0439023521|5.0|This was on my daughter's summer reading list a few years ago, and her friends told her it was great! When we ordered it we had no idea how popular it was, but she really liked it so we ordered the other two books as well. It arrived in okay packaging and took a while to arrive, but other than that, a good product!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am new to this kind of gaming so struggled a fair amount. A hint button would be nice. Other than that it was fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Heck yeah! This app is entertaining and challenging. Play it with your kids! Or with your neighbors.  Get it now, supplies are limited.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I feel that this book really never went anywhere.  Also, I found the main character to be irritating.  I planned to read the book and then see the movie.  At this point, I have no desire to see the movie.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I enjoyed this touching love story. There was no sordid gratuitous nudity not much violence. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery.
1442346949|5.0|A superbly written biography of an amazing leader. Great insights and a highly entertaining story; but not many lessons for us ordinary people.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse was my first real gaming mouse. When the mouse showed up, it came on time and the packaging looked very clean. The box had a window on the front that let me see the mouse before opening. After opening the package, I noticed that there was no CD for driver installation (the reason i removed a star). After going to Anker's website, I was able to find the drivers and could customize the macros. The Anker logo's color can be changed, but the scroll wheel and the dpi indicators do not change color, they remain blue. This does not annoy me because I planned on keeping the blue-black color scheme throughout my computer build. It's something to think about if you want a cohesive color scheme throughout your build.<br />On the right side of the mouse is a plastic that can get slightly annoying because it can be slippery. Other than that, the mouse feels great and performs exactly like I wanted it to. Anker did not disappoint with this mouse.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|I always love anything by Michael Buble. He has a great voice, the arrangements are fresh, and the band has a great sound.
B0085TJUGI|3.0|The author was pretty vague about what she saw on the other side.  Not as revealing about an afterlife as I thought it would be.
014241543X|4.0|I've had If I Stay by Gayle Forman on my to read list for several months now. Fans love this book. After I read it, I understood some of the hype-- it definitely tugs the heart strings. I rate this book 3.5 stars.<br /><br />If I Stay is about Mia, a girl who has gotten into a terrible car accident with the rest of her family. She has to choose for herself if it's worth it to stay and live. We see a mirage of past memories intermingled in what is going on with her broken body in the hospital and who comes to see her and why. It's very much a book about family, first love, and best friends.<br /><br />Mia's an interesting character. I loved that she was a cellist and into classical music (I'm a bit of a classical nerd as well), and I probably identified with her character than most. The most heart-wrenching moment for me was when she was talking about her little brother. My favorite character was likely her wonderful best friend, Kim, and the story of how they became friends in the first place. I also loved how her parents weren't typical.<br /><br />That said, I think I have this problem with Forman's writing in general. I feel that once the story is just about to take off, it ends. I think I kind of knew what Mia was going to decide in the end, so that wasn't a twist. I need a bit more to stay engaged. I felt I was drifting in a sea of memories with nothing to propel me forward. I appreciated how much Forman researched classical music and medical jargon, but as these are both things I have a ton of experience in, I could kind of tell she was reporting from the outside. But I don't think most readers will have an issue with this as her details are accurate.<br /><br />Overall, a beautiful and many times overwhelmingly sad novel. That said, I am more of a plot driven reader that needs a bit more in that area along with the wonderful details of Mia's life.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|In this season it picks off with the last episode and from there takes you on new adventures with SG-1.  I think this is very important season because it really opens up to the rest of the seasons and things yet to come. Enjoy everyone!!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|If there were was a higher rating, I would score the the maximum number of stars.  I saw Pitch Perfect the first time when my friends' kids brought their DVD for a sleepover here. I could not stop laughing!!!! The next morning they wanted to watch it again. I laughed harder  the second time because I caught many lines that I missed the time before.  Celebrating college graduation for my two kids, we watched Pitch Perfect as a family. We sang along and laughed at each other laughing at the movie! Oh my...I have more movie night stories; so, suffice it to say, I give this movie four thumbs up!
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|I can handle depressing books.  I actually steer away from anything too frothy.  This one, I am afraid, would depress a circus clown after his best stage performance.  Dark. Sad. No uplifting moments.  I finished it, hoping it would have some redemption at the end. Wrong. Went from depressing to clinically depressing.
B005MLOOJA|1.0|Season 1 was great! Season 2 was disappointing. The morals and values were lost this season. Bisexual relationships and adultry were the common thdme of the season. I can't watch this show anymore in good moral conscience. Too bad, because we really loved this series before it went that direction.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|First of all, this CPU is being used in the first PC build I've ever done, so I'm a bit of a rookie when it comes to technical stuff. I was aiming for a budget build and I think I got it with this little monster. Overall, I'm very pleased with it. The processing rate is great, none of my programs/games/etc. lag in anyway, and the little guy stays cool at normal operating uses. It normally idles at 32 degrees Celsius and goes up to 41 degrees on load so it's never hot.<br /><br />As for the integrated graphics, again, very satisfied with the results, though it's not for hardcore gamers. You need a dedicated GPU to get good performance. Videos and movies play without a hitch, and I can play most games on low-mid settings at around 1366x768 resolution and get decent FPS. I haven't used it for much else, so I can't comment on anymore than that, but regardless, Intel have one satisfied costumer.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />I'm not sure if it's cause of the Hyperthreading (don't really know what that means), but Windows shows me 4 cores instead of 2, I think it's great.<br /><br />My PC for reference:<br />Antec 900 Black Steel Mid-Tower Case<br />ASUS P8Z77-V LX Motherboard<br />Intel i3-3225 Dual Core 3.30 Ghz CPU with Intel 4000 iGPU<br />Corsair Builder Series CX 600 watt PSU<br />Corsair Vengance 8 GB RAM @ 1600 Mhz<br />Western Digital Blue 1TB HDD<br />Gigabyte Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost OC 2GB (which hasn't been installed yet)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am a major fan of Sylvia Day. I loved the other Crossfire books but was very disappointed in how Entwined with You ended. At first I thought the book hadn't downloaded completely on my kindle. So loved the book hated the ending..... 3 stars
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I have watched this show from season 1 and read the books. I love it...one of the best characters I have ever seen.
B000002KDG|5.0|If you're reading this, then I assume you're not familiar with this album. It's not Live. If you want Live, get \\"Live Rust\\". That said, take it from a guy who's idolized Neil Young since he was 10. I thank my older brother and sister to this day for taking me to see CSN&Y in '73 for my 11th birthday, and have been privileged to attend five other shows with Neil on stage since, including one with the phenomenal Crazy Horse. Young emphasizes that Crazy Horse is a lot more than just back-up musicians for him, and given the caliber of musicians that make up Crazy Horse it's easy to see why he feels he's among equals in the band. It'd be almost like looking at CSN&Y as primarily Neil's group, though I'm unaware of any lyrics penned by Crazy Horse members rather than NY. So what? Thing is, any respectable collection of blues/rock music will include the primary Neil Young and Crazy Horse albums: Everybody Knows This is Nowhere and this. If you haven't listened to this before, I almost envy you. You're in for getting blown away by some of the best music ever released. Leave this out of your collection, and it's like not having the Stones' Some Girls or Jackson Browne's The Pretender. You'll live without them. But, why would you want to?
6305144176|4.0|i remember vietnam news when i was young and as a teenager,so to me it remindes me of my childhood,thats how it was and we realy didnt know the truth of vietnam.when it first came out i realy enjoyed.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Simply awesome conclusion to the series.  Sanderson did an excellent job of bringing together all of the various emotional elements, introduced by Jordan, in an action packed backdrop of cataclysm and victory.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|All ages can use.Strategy but easy for older person.Told everyone about this game to download. Can't put down.  Love it time flies
1592403913|4.0|This book is great for those of us who are annoyed by incorrect punctuation. The writing is witty, and there are several &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments.<br />The only negatives are that the font seems a bit small, and the illustrations don't really add that much to the book's impact.  Perhaps the original edition would have been a better choice.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I'm on it all the time. U can find the coolest things on there. Everybody should get this app and get a pinterest!!!!
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|This was simply not my style of movie.  It was well done, the plot line seemed accurate and interesting.  I would recommend it to a person that liked this sort of movie.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not all my games are available through Amazon, other than that seems to work well. So far I am enjoying browsing through various titles.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The reason I liked this movie so much was because the family could enjoy it together.  It had an excellent story line, with enough suspense to hold your attention.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|im not a religion man but this games is really good. is challenger.... addicted i play for hours. four stars!!
B00BESNKB8|4.0|This is one of the better movies this year.  It was quite engaging.  Alot of unsuspected twists.  The characters become unlikely partners.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I get so many of these a day from some people and they are trash.  I also get some good ones from people that are really good.<br /><br />What I don't like is I keep getting these notifications that I cannot ask anyone to be my friend and I am not requesting people to be my friend, and have started rejecting from people.<br /><br />Also no place I can find to talk to anyone about the above, they have rules that are unknown and I don't understand their software and they way to operate it that well and really prefer emails.  I don't want everything I think out their for the entire world of facebook or anyone else to know about.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I am a super-hero freak.  I loved the plot and the way the characters were pulled together.  It was a little difficult to believe as far as The Hulk controlling his anger, but great anyway
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I am constantly amazed that Nalini Singh manages to keep this series so fresh. The much-anticipated story of Councillor Kaleb Krychek won't disappoint.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|This is one of Ethan Hawke's best performances to date. The story line is very original. Due to the dark nature of the film I would only recommend watching once.
B0064BWDRW|2.0|The Harry Hole series ends here with overdriven portraying of squalor and violence in the drug-linked milieu in Oslo.  The ending is far from “good”.  This is not the kind of book I wish to read in my leisure hours.  “Crime” is one thing, degradation quite another!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Wonderfully done. The best prequel to come along in a long time. James Franco takes his acting to a new level.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|I used this book to tweak my technique after 30 years of running. I  am  really pleased with the advice and results.  I was surprised by the effectiveness of the concepts, especially pelvic rotation.  That really clicked for me.
1481130331|4.0|This book is the first in the series, The Three Nations Trilogy. I have already read the second book, Sebastian, (yes, i read them out of order) however the stories aren't set one after the other like a traditional series, each book is set in a similar era and are just each from a different perspective of a family living in a different Central European country. I think it is quite a unique and clever way of writing a series.<br /><br />The story follows the life of Greta, the eldest daughter of Jonah Weissensteiner through before and during WWII. Through consequences of passion, Greta is whisked away to live with her new husband, Wilhelm Winkelmeier on the family farm. However with the political situations occurring in Germany, Greta's Jewish ancestry becomes a burden to the Winkelmeiers. Through the strength and the luck of the Weissensteiners, Greta and her family face the challenges before them, persevering to make it out the other side.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading The Luck of the Weissensteiners. I found it well written and interesting. It was informative and gave insight to what it was like for the people living in Slovakia before and during WWII. I think it was also close to my heart because i am of Czechoslovakian ancestry.<br /><br />Even though this was a work of fiction (based on historical events), i found that it was almost like a written documentary. It was written very factually, which i found i actually quite liked. It did prevent me from fully connecting with all of the characters though because even though there were emotional situations occurring, the tone of the book wasn't very emotional, it was very rational.<br /><br />I also really appreciated the epilogue. It was well detailed and really tied up all the loose ends. I definitely feel that a lot of books have a rushed ending, and sometimes they try to make it up with an epilogue (which is completely fine, however most of the epilogues are pretty much, \\"and they lived happily every after. The end.\\"). I was really impressed with this epilogue and how without spoiling anything, it wasn't all \\"happily ever after\\" but it was explained well and very realistic. I think that's what also made it seem like a written documentary.<br /><br />I must admit there were some parts towards the end of the story that were a little bit unrealistic. Again, without spoiling anything, i found some of the characters and situations a bit too lighthearted and carefree for the situations they were in and also the era.<br /><br />The map at the beginning of the book was also really helpful in understanding who was controlling the different parts of Czechoslovakia. It was a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall it was an insightful read and i would definitely recommend it to those who like historical fiction. I would probably also recommend it those who aren't really fans of fiction either because of the way it was written.<br /><br />This review is based on a digital copy provided by the author.nd.\\").

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very fun and addictive game. it is good because you actually get to do stuff unlike other games
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Against all odds square enix has remastered another final fantasy game in order to let the series and it's fans live on. The game runs great for the kindle fire and I would recommend this title for any RPG lover!
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun fun fun when I don't know what to do I go to this game and just hang out try it you will enjoy
B003V4AK8E|3.0|The controller feels nice, a little rougher than I was used to on the grips, but comfortable overall. For the first few hours I had the controller it worked without a flaw and held its battery easily. However, on the second day of having it it started losing its connection. This delay would only last a second or 2 but it started happening more and more often. I recommend keeping it plugged in if you are using any games that require constant movement to succeed in. Otherwise a good controller.
B00321MGPG|5.0|The other reviews are true!  This series is fantastic!  The videography is breathtaking. There's a lot of variety to each episode.  It doesn't focus on only animals or only landscape, but captures the amazing, scary, or mesmerizing aspects of it all.<br />We were watching it with our kids and our 8 year old was initially very disturbed by the killing of animals by other animals.  In the first episode, a wolf kills a baby caribou who was separated from his mother.  That was pretty upsetting to him.  But once he knew what to expect he was less upset by it.  Last night we watched the episode where a crocodile ate a wildebeest by grabbing its leg.  It took an hour for it to drown it and my son was sad that it suffered for an hour, but got over it.  Anyway, if you have sensitive children, be prepared that this series shows nature as it is, which at times is quite brutal.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I am 12 years old and LOVE reading. The plot of this story is simple. Two completely different people fall in love... Read this, you won't regret it!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game that makes you think.  Looking forward to more levels and challenges.  I have to admit there were a few times I got stuck and had to google for help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a game that I really extensively extremely positively love more than any other game in the entire world.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've always enjoyed bingo games, and this is by far one of my favorites. They have lobby's of all sorts with different challenges.
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|Bottom line: This is a good movie. Highly entertaining and I enjoyed watching it. This movie is an adventure story, albeit a very slow moving one with no explosions, and a story about lost potential. How the viewer defines that lost potential is more about the viewer then the story itself, but that is part of the appeal of this movie.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is a movie.  Not a documentary. Not a biography. If you want facts, then you should do what I have so far failed to do and get the book that the movie is loosely based on.<br /><br />However, if you want truth, the kind of truth based on human emotion, then this Sean Penn directed movie might be your cup of tea.<br />\\"Into the Wild\\" is especially moving because pretty much every able bodied boy has entertained, if only for a few seconds, the fantasy leaving the world and living in the wild. Of course, normally, family ties, the desire for material goods, and other interests, such as girls, keep this from being more than a passing fantasy.<br /><br />This is not to say that Chris McCandless, AKA Alexander Supertramp, is the perfect hero in this story. The way he turned his back on his family - especially his sister, the lack of adequate resources for his adventure in Alaska, and his inability to build long term relationships with others are very disconcerting.<br /><br />Also, to be completely honest, the way Chris McCandless lived was the life of a free loader. He isn't rejecting the modern world to live off the bounty of nature; he uses gas station bathrooms for water, churches and homeless shelters when necessary, and accepts the generosity of strangers. Culturally, this makes him a freeloader, as defined by anthropologists, not Webster's dictionary, in that he consistently uses more of society's resources then he generates. Given the state of most free land, abandoned military bases, Bureau of Land Management land, and National Forests/Parks, it probably isn't possible to live off the land in thisday and age the way we think of Daniel Boone doing. Unless of course you are willing to occasionally trespass and/or use common resources that are really intended for paying customers and/or taxpayers. Even while in Alaska, Mr McCandless survives for as long as he did by hunting out of season.  Harmless, if one person does it (free loader), but if every hunter did it, hunting quickly becomes unsustainable and destroys whole species.<br /><br />On a side note, there is a whole subculture of folks that live full time on BLM campsites and places like Slab City. This movie does give the viewer a very brief - and probably idealized - look at this subculture. That subculture is not the focus of this movie, but is one of the more interesting parts.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the sound track is quite good. In this reviewer's opinion, the sound track contributes quite a bit to the powerful emotions that this movie creates.<br /><br />This movie is way too long. Sean Penn obviously liked the subject matter and there was no one with the authority to edit it down to a more reasonable length.<br /><br />Many viewers, especially the ones that live and work in Alaska or around the edge of modern America's wilderness areas, are especially critical of Mr McCandless and this movie.  They may be correct in their criticisms, but miss the point that this movie is about the spiritual and emotional journey of one young man and how that journey is cut short just when he is on the cusp of transformation.<br /><br />Moreover, there are controversies about this movie. Did Mr McCandless poison himself on purpose or accidently? Did he simply starve?<br /><br />In any event, as much as I liked this movie, I don't think that I could watch it another time. At least, not any time soon, the movie is just too long and ends on in such a sad way.
1885167776|5.0|Gary,<br /><br />Again you've hit the nail on the head. That is \\"the One Nail\\". Your ability to see simplicity in our complex world is uncanny.  You not only say it you act on it. Starting with the way you framed this book; 3 chapters, The Lies, The Truth, The Results.<br /><br />The One Thing I got from you and this book is the knowledge that I have dedicated the last 8 years to 'one thing' and then I allowed my Catholic Guilt to interfere as a accepted to goals of other. Seemly unaware of placating them as I felt 'they' were more important. One of the myths of attempting to be ok in eyes of others. \\"Stop It\\" it's one thing first to put you and Stephen Covey together.<br /><br />Thanks for all the solid, factual, believable, doable, lesson of \\"The One Thing\\".<br /><br />Keep Smiling<br />Rossi<br />[...]
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|She has written another great book in a great series.  Ready for more!!  Can't put the book down!!  Rates high just like the first 2 books in the series.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This season was my introduction to Dr. Who.  I liked the actors, the stories weren't bad, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Please see my review of Part 1 for a brief synopsis of the plot.<br />This disc finishes the story and it provides a nice mythic end to the whole Batman legend.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, it shows how Bruce Wayne after decades of fighting crime as the Batman realizes that to have any lasting effect and meaningful change on society he has to look beyond just Gotham City and try to work at fixing society at a fundamental level. A terrific translation of the great Frank Miller comic.<br /><br />This is an animated cartoon - not a live action film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! All the drama and scandle. I think the characters are well developed and I couldn't stop watching it
B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed watching this show on tv. I am now catching up on it and I am really enjoying it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm intrigued and left wanting more. I'm glad the story of Eva & Gideon isn't over  I wish the next was available now
B00AM0C6YG|1.0|Interesting album, but rather pedestrian. The lyrics of the songs, nice. Laura's voice is more talking than singing, very one dimensional.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was just that, okay.  It had some good parts in it,but it seemed to be another &#34;spinoff&#34; of Fifty Shades.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of my favorite books of the past several years. Gorgeously told. Elegantly paced and beautifully Imagined. Ill read it again soon.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love this app I fell on love with it.. honestly it works a lot better with my kindle fire. The other YouTube app I have wasn't working right.. I enjoy this app so much!!! :)
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Please remind me not to live in North Korea.  This novel is unbearable in its depiction, but I was not able to put it down.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Review by Joey. I beleted everything from my kindle fire, because it said the internal storage was way too low to download this app. Seriously just got rid of every app that I could get rid of, and it still will not download! I am going to try to shut my kindle down, and see what happens, but as far as this goes, it looks awsome, but needs an upgrade to let you download it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada is a dynamic, well-researched story of intrigue and action.  Stevenson masterfully weaves a story that will draw you in from the beginning.  Set against the backdrop of World War II, this entertaining and engaging book follows the trials and tribulations of British Naval agent, Ian Fleming.  Stevenson's book provides great insight into the history and the experiences of man who created James Bond.  A must read not just for Bond enthusiasts, but for everyone.  I highly recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Color isn't the greatest could be much better. Otherwise is is very good and you want to continue watching to see what happens.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Everything was fine. This is an excellent book that everyone needs to read! I have already given it out to a lot of people.
B002Q6OHAK|5.0|this album is a classic since '95 Ol' Dirty Bastard is a legend and also my husbands first cousin, so cop the album to support his family and his music, and to keep his music alive for all the Wu Tang fans....Wu Tang forever!!!

B00AKL1XPU|3.0|worked at first now it won't load up.  very disappointed even tried uninstalling and re install works for a short period .
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|As a kid, I was glued to the television every time that Star Trek: The Next Generation would be airing on &#34;The New TNN.&#34; I became a Trekkie (er) very quickly, and I was obsessed with TNG in every aspect. I also became a huge fan of Voyager, The Original Series, and the films. However, I watched Deep Space Nine with great excitement and anticipation, only to find my liking was not as strong to the series. I did watch a few episodes, but could never grab hold of the show's character and style.<br /><br />I completely understand now why that was so. It was a Star Trek series designed for adult behavior and level of thinking, not to that of a child. I started watching the series a few days ago to give it another chance, and I am now addicted to it beyond what I could have imagined. This series has unbelievable depth, rapid development, and clever humor. I encourage you to watch this excellent first season, and then keep going, because it only gets MUCH better!<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for allowing Prime members to watch for free. I never would've thought about watching had the company not posted the episodes. Thank you very much.
B008602KQI|1.0|I put off watching this movie because I knew the general story line.  I am running out of prime TV and Movies that are not cartoons or so I thought I'd give this one a try.  It simply is not believable; an alternative reality.  The characters are Sci Fi Cartoons in human bodies.  The people in this movie are not human.  They may as well be two classes of zombies.<br /><br />Simply awful unless you're a teenager, or adult with adolescent taste and sensibilities.
B005VPXNV2|5.0|Classic movie that will never die. The original super fan goes crazy and obsession to the death!  This movie will make you cringe as the plot twists and turns
B005DJREJS|1.0|I don't see how this could be very interesting if you are actually a thinking adult.  Total waste of time.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follet  is a master of the narrative. Amazing character and setting development. Intriguing, well documented, highly recommend. Loved it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the best game of all! It was so fun I couldn't stop! I got in trouble so many times because I didn't stop!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the book but felt uncomfortable reading it. The many curves that were thrown had me feeling that my thoughts were becoming unsettled. It made me think a lot about how I would feel if my child was on trial and how difficult it would be to have to be in the courtroom every day. The ending was not at all what I expected it to be.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Its a must buy if you like Rock, Metal, Alternative!!<br />My body, Dead but rising, The Hangmans body count are my favorites!!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked &#34;The Kiterunners&#34; much better.  The latter was better written, had a strong theme that resonated and held my attention for longer periods of time.  &#34;Kiterunners&#34; is unforgettable, while &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; is a book that will fade quickly from my memory.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Waiting for this book was making me think that I might be hyping it up in my mind and that it would really let me down - but it so didn't, I started reading and like all her books that I have read (and re-read) gave me her wonderful charaters.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Started slow but came together amazingly at the end. Nice follow up to the Harry potter series. Can't wait until her next book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is a great movie, it follows the book. I collect all different Jane Eyer movies I can find and so far this is the best one. My sister we have watched it over and over. Great buy and great price.
0399159347|5.0|I can't decide if I want to call this the perfect beach read or too heavy for a beach vacation. I'm going with it's an any time book that has a light storyline with some super serious notes. Every single one of the characters in The Husband's Secret was interesting to me and the book held the perfect amount of suspense and \\"twists\\" without venturing off into a realistic land. It's the kind of book that really makes you wonder \\"what would I do?\\" and I admit that I ended the book still not really knowing. But I've been thinking about it non-stop since I finished!<br /><br />I did read What Alice Forgot from Liane Moriarty and loved it, too. The Husband's Secret is told in the same sort of voice, but is a completely different book. Read it on the beac, read it on the train, or read it in bed; no matter where you read it, I'm pretty sure you won't be able to put it down!
B0030KKLNS|5.0|Okay...I get it. I really get it now. All the hoopla over World War Z leading up to the release of the movie seemed like a lot of over-the-top hype. That is...until I read the book. After the first few interviews (scenes), I had to flip through the rest just to see if that was really what the whole book was going to be. My initial disappointment was quickly turned around as the flashbacks from individual characters all over the world became more and more interesting. By the time the story got to the family in Troy, Montana, I was hooked. Colonel Christina Eliopolis's story was heart-thumping, and Kondo and Tomonaga in Japan were sympathetic characters that an entire book could have been written around. Then...there's a submarine scene that'll absolutely make your skin crawl. The amount of technical detail and research Brooks put into this epic story is mind-boggling. Techno-geeks and artillery-happy readers will be well-fed as well as anyone that can appreciate that we are all human and any type of global apocalypse would be very personal to each and every one of us, no matter what part of the world we live in. A very interesting read.
B0078QYI1G|5.0|first heard them on  the &#34;Give Me the Banjo&#34; documentary. They were filmed playing &#34;No Man's Mama,&#34; which is one of the strongest and most fun tracks on this album. I just think they are one of the genuinely coolest bands around due to their talent, nod to American music roots, and did I mention their talent already? Because that comes in plentiful.
030758836X|5.0|This book was so striking, it's no wonder everyone I knew was talking about it. Without giving away too much, I will simply say that the author was a master of deception, because not only does she have characters who deceive each other, but we, the readers, were deceived as well (I mean this in a positive way). I found myself switching sides because of this, with strong feelings about the behaviors of each character. While many people I know had issues about the ending, I have to say that in a lot of ways there was a certain reality to it, with possible potential for a sequel. It's the kind of book you think about for a long time after you read it. You'll find yourself losing sleep over it, and wanting to talk about it with friends. This would be a great choice for a book club to read.
0439813786|5.0|This is an incredible book.  The story is wonderful, but even better, is the way the pictures help to tell the story.  The detail in the pictures will amaze you.
0316078913|5.0|I absolutely love this book. In fact, I recently made a gift of it to my very dear friend. Sedaris is just so funny and tells his stories well.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The writing is beautiful and well researched.  I love the way his characters are interwoven and developed.  I am going to read more by this author!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I was hesitant to read this and it had a slow beginning but then I found that I couldn't put it down.  Great book.  A modern day Lord of the Flies.
B005EGXTEE|2.0|I got this because I heard it was good and a movie was made from it (which I haven't seen).  Very disappointing.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works very good was having trouble with u tube  and v tube and could not see my videos.  This app solved the problem.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|Update: My original review was for version 1.0.5, which was the most stable version of the game I have played. When I updated to version 1.3.3, the game became unplayable due to constant freezing and crashing. Version 1.4 is playable but it is still not as stable as version 1.0.5 was. Also, while the original version was challenging, this one is just unfair. The main thing that bugs me now is that some obstacles and attacks are literally unavoidable, whereas in the original game you could avoid them with a little bit of skill. I'm specifically referring to the blimps and attacks from Super Synthoids. My last run was ended by a blimp that I did not even touch, yet I still took damage from it. This did not happen in version 1.0.5. Even if I am all the way on the side of the screen, I still take damage from the blimps. Super Synthoid attacks are the same way. In the past, I could avoid them by flying to the opposite side of the screen, but now they hit me no matter where I am. Totally unfair.<br /><br />On a smaller note, while the file size is smaller, it only takes up about 10 MB less on my tablet than version 1.3.3 (it's still larger than 1.0.5) and I think the way they did that was by removing the voice clips. Other than cutscenes (which you can only see once), all other voice clips, with the exception of Rhodey's clip when you use War Machine for the first time, are removed, and even Rhodey's clip only plays once.<br /><br />While there are plenty of genuine additions and improvements to this game, the bugs and increased file size hurt the experience. I wanted to switch back to version 1.0.5 but it is not possible. I hope the next update does not add any new content but rather fixes the bugs in the game. This game already has plenty of content and will keep anyone busy for a long time.<br /><br />They should also say how large the game is when fully downloaded. The product page says 15 MB, but once I downloaded the whole game, it took up 1.04 GB on my tablet<br /><br />Original review: The basic gameplay/structure could best be described as a cross between Temple Run and Extreme Road Trip (another favorite of mine), in that it has similar gameplay to Temple Run (you keep flying until you run out of HP) but a mission and currency structure similar to Extreme Road Trip 2 (with ISO-8 crystals replacing Bucks and Stark Credits replacing Coins). Of course, this being an Iron Man game, you also have to shoot enemies.<br /><br />The game, as of version 1.0.5, comes with 20 suits to collect. However, you start the game with only 2 and are not allowed to have more than three until you buy more storage (one slot at a time) or dismantle one of your existing suits (the Mark III can not be dismantled, however). In order to buy more storage slots, you need to spend ISO-8, which brings me to how this game monetizes itself: by selling ISO-8.<br /><br />The game uses ISO-8 for just about everything. It is used for reviving, upgrading power-ups, and buying storage. It can also be used to buy armor and speed up construction and upgrades. You can earn ISO-8 in-game by leveling up and completing certain missions (especially the Daily Missions) but it is very difficult to collect ISO-8 in this fashion. Instead, the developers want you to purchase ISO-8 in-game. Because of that, I recommend saving ISO-8 for revival and storage. Suits can be unlocked with XP (which has no other use, otherwise). If an armor is taking a long time to build or upgrade, just use one of the other armors or turn off the game and come back later. The construction/upgrade will continue even if you are not using the app.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that even if you unlock a suit using XP or ISO-8, you still need Stark Credits to build it (which you collect during runs and by completing missions). This may seem a little strange at first, but it allows you to unlock suits without having to build each one of them in order (since you need to unlock the weaker suits before being allowed to build the more powerful ones).
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really like this book. The characters are interesting, the world is well-constructed, and the series is set up to be really cool. Really looking forward to future books by the author.
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|I deleted the movie as soon as it was over. If I was watching it alone I would have not finished it. I genuinely laughed twice. Eventually I became bored waiting for it to get good. All of the long, over-extended jokes that most don't like or don't understand from Family Guy coupled with the poor jokes about vague celebrities fill this movie.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Once started it is hard to find a place to stop. You continue to play one level after the other without being aware of time. Has been such a great game during a time of illness!
B007SSEZNA|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow seems quite comfortable in this type of role ~ it is an all time favorite, one that can be watched over and over again!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The author has a talent for drawing the characters, including herself, as real people, sympathetic, but not stereotypical or sentimentalized.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to use. I like all of my mail in the same place, but this is ok. Notifications are a plus
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Grandaughter loved it! She is 7 and enjoyed the story and it kept her interested all the way throught the movie.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a wonderful book about life, trust in the system, reality, history, ethics, and a writer who found a passion sitting in biology class. Loved it
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I waited for what felt like a lifetime for book 3 in the crossfire series. Sylvia did not disappoint. Just when you think you can't fall anymore in love with not only Gideon but the romance between him and Eva you do. This is an amazing series for any lover of romance, erotica and intrigue. Forget 50 shades people believe me this is 1000 shades!!!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This book is an exciting and mind boggling story. It kept me interested from the beginning to the very end. It is a real page turner and I didn't want to put it down. It is a very good read.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Maybe this album has value if you like a bloddy rear. Otherwise its utter crap, junk,  and a waste of 30+ mins of your life.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I would say because of our special effects and graphics today; it is ten times better than &#34;Star Wars&#34;; but that's my opinion.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|My remarks for Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels remain the same.  See previous remarks.  I read so much, I can't remember the storyline to comment on.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Never had any major glitches. When I first bought a game from them I had issues with DirectX10 but that wasn't there fault; it was the computer I had which was outdated. After which, I shortly updated and everything was crystal clear. Perfect! Love the gameplay and graphics are amazing.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Me and my friends are 9 & 10 years old.  This is our favorite game. I would recommend this to anyone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game. whoever invented this game is smart. This game is great for little kids to show them about responsibility.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully Written, Wonderfully Acted And Highly Entertaining! What Else Could I Say? I Only Wish We Had Something Like This Playing Regularly In The States!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy this series and the acting is outstanding.  I became hooked when I watched the first two seasons.
0739366408|3.0|Was not what I expected. Some parts were good, but there were many slow part that was very boring.  Just an ok book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Tesla was a true genius, always more concerned with science than profit. His battles with and for Edison, JP Morgan and Westinghouse were fascinating. A quick and enjoyable read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved watching this Series. Outstanding program, the family, and their household help do an amazing job of bringing history to life.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love this DVD!!!  These guys are so very talented.<br />I can sit and listen to this music a never tire of it...
B007N8RULO|1.0|cannot go beyond the opening screen which is pretty frustrating, no answers in help. paid for something I did not get
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|We are very happy with this DVD.....The piano guys are very talented guys:-)<br />Never get tired of listening to this music....very relaxing!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Great!!!!!! Great series. Very interesting bits of history.  Mary gets old occasionally, all that  whining . Historical narrative. It is wonderful especially Branson. &#60;3
B00D2K40WY|5.0|4 year old has a blast with it. She gets to dress up dolls and doesn't have go make a mess!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|this is a good time consuming game it is hard and fun at  the same time . makes your brain work
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The story was good.. But the colors and effects are awesome in HD. I would definetly recommend watching the HD version.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|easy to read ,did'nt wont to put it down , kept me company on my day off , this one is a must for the shopping cart
B00785P2QC|4.0|just started and its not too shabby...ive played other city Sim games and this one seems helpful when starting out.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Mashup from the original movie, some period pieces from 19th c, 1930's and the present.  badly put together, OK visuals.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Cheaper than trying to get it locally, especially if pre-ordered.  Would definitely recommend for those needing this set for a good price.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Not your typical superhero. Like other DC comic heroes, there's a dark side to this character. Interesting to see what more they can do for the next season.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Love Tom in any movie.  Great plot and easy to sit back and enjoy.  Would recommend to anyone to watch.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Great. I got addicted in spite of being predictable and very cliche. And they are a little to open minded for the era.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good quick read with a great price. Love that things ended up working out with this whirlwind romance and these two characters.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|As I understand it, this movie is based off 5 pages of a book that was written years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I like seeing historical movies that are as accurate as can possibly be knowing there will be some Hollywood embellishment involved at some point in the making of the movie.
B001QD5OSS|4.0|I like Johnny Depp a lot and this movie is very nice. It's interesting to see a movie he made when he was a bit younger.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|I loved reading the book and I loved watching the movie on dvd. Only wished there were more special features on the dvds...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've been binge watching seasons 1-3 of this superb drama. Not only is this one of the most talented ensemble casts on television, but it also features some of the best guest star storylines since Will & Grace. (If you're a Broadway fan, you'll love seeing the Broadway stars that pop up left and right.) I definitely recommend taking some time to enjoy The Good Wife.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the movie! My ONLY complaint is that there are not more special features about the movie itself. They seem to focus more on giving 3-4 different ways to watch the movie, but not necessarily giving us &#34;behind the scenes&#34; footage which I happily pay the extra $$$ to see!
B007FTZDN8|3.0|This is a nice scan of the fantastic TED approach with good clips of speakers. However, I was expecting to see full TED talks rather just a floods of short clips. First DVD feels more like an infomercial. In know the full talks are available online but I was hoping for more in the DVDs - especially for the price.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|better than candy crush. gives your brain a challenge. I gave up on candy crush and with this I don't miss it anymore.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|This is possibly the best action movie ever made, it jumps from one scene of tense action, right to the next, while still having lots of fun. The movie looks Great on Blu Ray, and has some sweet features, like 2 commentaries 1 from the writer and director, and another from the f/x guy. I saw this movie when I was a kid and it hasn't lost any of it's glory in the past 20 years. If you already enjoy the movie, and are trying to decide if it is worth getting the Blu Ray, I would say it is, and if you have never seen this epic of joy and mayhem, then buy a copy, take your shoes off, and come out to the coast, we'll have a few laughs, get together!
B001C18KGC|4.0|This is a great recording although the quality of the recording isn't quite what I thought it would be given it's an import.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very well made show.  The characters really draw you in to their stories.  I love Downton Abbey
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Great flick  I love all of the Fast and Furious movies and this did not disappoint.<br />I just love all Vin Diesel movies
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie.  It is not &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; or &#34;Taxi Driver&#34; but it is a great movie for older (almost tween) kids.  She loves scary stuff - and this has the right amount of scare, awesome acting (Especially Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson)  a little bit of romance....She has seen it about 8 times now.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|If you love Vin and his fast paced movies you will love this first installment in the Fast and Furious genre
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The graphics and color are good.  Kids love the game and will keep them busy for hours and parents also like the game.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Great acting ,very interesting story with lot of depth.<br />Couldn't find any flaws in the movie at all.<br />I cant think if any movie i could compare it to.<br />Its like Law & Order SVU + teen movie.<br />Each on of these teens are suffering in some way.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very well directed and produced. This film was extremely informative and has had a major impact on how my family and I eat in the future.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've played many games like these but this one is one of a kind. It's challenging but fun and exciting at the same time.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Crossfire Series & have loved Gideon & Eva's story. I was let down by this book because there just wasn't much there. It could have been a good half of a whole book.(if that makes sense) I would still suggest the series but let everyone know to be prepared for a let down when you reach the third book. I will read the rest of the series.
0316548189|2.0|The book received was not the book (I thought) I ordered.  Very disappointed.  I ordered &#34;The Long Road to Freedom&#34; and it has a VERY close-up facial photo of Nelson Mandela with a giant smile.  Can anything be done if I mail the wrong book, which you sent me, back to Amazon.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|love the added episodes of Om Nom's travels! And of course the adorable graphics and fun game play we've come to expect!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I am not sure what all the hype is about, but I really did not enjoy this. I had to struggle to finish this book.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Read them all as a child growing up. Bought them as a grown up and read them all again. I have the audio boxs but the read is still the best
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Not bad, not good either.  I thought there would be more on the French Riviera but was disappointed.  No too exciting.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Read them all as a child growing up. Bought them as a grown up and read them all again. I have the audio boxs but the read is still the best.
B0082Z447U|4.0|This was recommended to me.  A classic which actually made it harder for me to read, just as I expected.  But no regrets.  I liked it.
B002361MLA|5.0|Just perfect book for people with anxiety. .. we tend to forget to be in the present moment,  and Ekhart Tolle just help us to understand how to do it...AMAZING
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I didn't expect much from this movie but was surprised by how entertaining it was.  Very good special effects also.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I saw the Lincoln Lawyer movie, then tried this book.  Was not really a mystery reader before but I am now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is absolutely wonderful fun and its free. I thought that it was going to be a rip off of the game temple run just like brave but minion rush is its own fun game similar to surfur run
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am so addi Tex to this game. However I have used up all my storage and can not plays anymore:-(
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|The game is a little lame compared to all the other ones. When and why did they ad all those damnable commercials after each play?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game I play it everyday. This game is the best your can even try to beat your friend's high score from Facebook!If you're ever bored and you want to play a game I recommend subway surfers. Get subway surfers I'm sure you'll be addicted too!
B008602KQI|5.0|I've lost count of how many times I have watched this movie because it is THAT good!  A friend told me it was better than the Twilight Saga and I said, &#34;no way!&#34; But it is!  There is a great amount of action and suspense.  The plot and sub plots are entertaining to follow.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have runned my device till it was completely dead just in time to get it to the charger and to get
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This was horrible.  Great special effects and scenic design coupled with terrible acting and writing.  You know you're in trouble when the porcelain doll and a flying monkey are better actors than the &#34;live&#34; actors.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is s fun and good game fore Sylvester stallone fans and hoes and if your reading this your wasting your time
B00CLD65X0|5.0|An engaging glimpse into the social life of an upper class English family and their serants.  Individual personalities are well portrayed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|More twists than Chubby Checker; a page-turner that kept me up way past my bedtime.  Chilling and utterly plausible...a great read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this app much more than Temple run.  The characters cost less, you can earn gems to save yourself.  There are also good daily and weekly challenges to keep it interesting.  I would highly recommend it for hours of free addictive fun.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I was so pleased to see that (thankfully) this movie DID NOT CONTAIN ANY \\"F\\" words!  It was a fun and exciting movie, particularly for those who are into the action/zombie flicks.  For the most part, I am not uneasy with this type of film, but I have to admit to at least a couple of jumps. That was the fun part!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I must say that I really like this game. It's addictive...and the around the world tour is nice. Great game for kids.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I'm a big Streisand fan and was so excited to read she was making this film with Rogen (whom I also enjoy).<br />Unfortunately I never got to see this in the theater (as it left so quickly in my area) and I had to watch the DVD instead. It was such a cute movie and exactly what I wanted it to be! Streisand & Rogen were perfect together as mother & son! Such a fun movie I ended up watching it several times the weekend the DVD came!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This app is awesome! Very fun game with big challenges. Some levels will make you chuckle.<br />An addicting game. Great to share with everyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty fun game. The puzzles are decently challenging and take more than just random clicking. Can't wait for more levels.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very interesting to see an inside view of what I witnessed unfold as a kid. So on and so forth.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed learning more about the Afghan culture and trials of living.  Really held my interest throughout.  Can't wait for his next book.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I've watched this at least 6 times now! Never gets old.<br /><br />The humor is similar to Bridesmaids, the music is very recent Top 40.  I can't wait for a sequel to come out!  I can watch it over and over again and I recommend it to all my friends and family!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is so easy to become captivated by this show and the characters. The writing and character development are simply brilliant. If I didn't have an 11 month old son, I'm sure I could've watched the entire season in one sitting! It's like a book you can't put down. I'm anxious to watch the last three episodes!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books I have EVER read.  Have told everyone I work w/about this book.  Can't wait to read another by her.
B007EDYN36|4.0|I have always loved KISS. It is interesting to know how many trials and tribulations they had as a band. It is also interesting to read the same stories from different points of view.
B0062QRTKA|1.0|this is not that exciting. very limited game play. lacks in any type of gamer experience. Don't bother downloading it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is so much fun you just have to wait on your energy to restore alot of fun to play would recommend this game for anyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this series of books.  My kids suggested I read them.  There are a few typos on the Kindle Edition, but overall it is very good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. The level of difficulty is great. Making it fun for everyone. Thanks for a great way to pass the time.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|At first, this was a great waiting room game, but after so many levels, you never run out of coins and the challenge is gone.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever watched. The writing is excellent and the actors are perfect. One of very few shows that gets better with each season.
B00407PNWO|5.0|You can't go wrong with this classic!  I bought it for a daughter's school project and have watched it several times myself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Quite a challenge at times but definitely one of the best escape games out there! And was a free game! 5 stars! Can`t wait for more of this one to release more!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There are a few typos on the Kindle Edition, but not many.  Overall, I love this book series, and am very happy.
B009E2U7L2|5.0|Loving her songs and attitude. Hope she can keep it up.<br />Looking forward to the next one.<br />Go Cher! New fan.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The liners and special DVDs aren't in this set, but the movie disc set itself is compact and includes all the movies.  Perfect for long trips and movie marathon days.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Combined great artistic and interesting photography with a terrific storyline and the actor who plays the crazed detective is superb.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There are a few typos on the Kindle Edition, but I love having the books easily at my fingertips.  Great series.
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Does not work either that or its not compatible with wd2go..... this app has issues playing files on network drives. I don't like it because it freezes my device as well. Looks like its gonna have a bad review and I'm deleting it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series, this one was pretty tough in comparison to the rest. I couldn't put it down. Collins is an evil genius, this whole series was brilliant.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Something you can love  Something great!!! Plays videos from my wd network drive also great look. Never fails on my 7&quot; fire, plays video faster then the stock video player and mobo player
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This movie was so amazing sweet and had a great twist. Def a classic and I highly recommend it to everyone
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I looked at this game and downloaded it out of curiosity.  It does require a bit of thought which I believe is the point of the game.
B003DS9ECQ|5.0|my roommate and I have been on a bit of a nostalgia binge recently. Nintendo 64 is still awesome but Power Rangers is now one of the weirdest, worst edited and acted I've ever laid my adult eyes on (although the theme song is still rad as hell) so I got scared when Space Jam was requested.<br /><br />This movie was a good percentage of my childhood. I was already well aware of the fact that both Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes were the alpha predators in their respective genres but it blew my 7 year old mind when they came together.<br /><br />Coming back as a 24 year old with a good taste in movies (I will not watch any film whom Michael Bay had a hand in creating) I was not disappointed. The animation is some of the best in American cartoons (not as good as Roger Rabbit, but that's not a kid's movie), and MJ actually has on-screen chemistry with these actors who don't exist. Also, there are jokes that sailed 30 feet over my head when I was a kid such as the woman at the Knick's game saying \\"This guy its doing something weird in his raincoat,\\"  the Elmer Fudd/Yosemite Sam Pulp Fiction reference, when the psychiatrist asks Patrick Ewing if there are any other areas where he can't \\"perform,\\" and Bill F-ing Murray's reason for getting into Looney Tune Land was because he \\"knew the producer.\\"<br /><br />Also, the soundtrack is probably the greatest in the history of cinema in terms of everyday listenability.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I liked the book and readily recommend it.<br />This not  a book review ,just my opinion.<br />I now have read all of the reacher books.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Loved this one. One of my most favority DVD.  It had the best of 4 or 5 different shows.  Blended so well together to make one beautiful show.
B008ROB9H4|5.0|the theme and story line were great. the acting was above average.  held interest<br />Couldn't wait to enjoy next episode
B0091LS0BU|5.0|loved this DVD.  Easy to the ears...black and white which is perfect for this setting.<br />Great Job by all in the band.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have been holding out on watching the HBO series so that I can read the books.  The level of detail and character development is pretty amazing.  My only disappointment with this book is that Martin decided to only focus on a few of the characters and use book 5 for the remaining characters.  There also was not as much plot twist in this book compared to some of his other books making it a tad bit more predictable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the most captivating show I've seen in a while! I just hate the next season is ready yet!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy and time consuming it is awesome but marveless great challenging i will tell my friends stupendous outrageously fantastic wow
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Well written but a bit long on the family involvement, which was often redundant.  Also, many readers will find his compulsion to write clinically a bit off putting, but, as a nurse, I skipped those parts. I doubt the reader wants a lesson in pathophysiology and anatomy laced in among the authors NDE experiences.
B00103584Y|5.0|Awesome movie with a great take on &#34;time travel&#34; and &#34;what ifs&#34;. Run Lola Run is a great movie by the director of Cloud Atlas
B004X75RK4|5.0|Great movie, loved it, this is the second time I have watched it and laughed just as hard! Highly Recommend
B00DC6YEE2|5.0|I have a whole bunch of 3D movies in my collection and I have to say \\"TNBC\\" is my favorite.  Dare I say I enjoy it more than \\"Titanic\\", \\"Avatar\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Polar Express\\" and the spectacular \\"Toy Story 3\\" (to name a few)?  Yes, these are all rightfully considered classics I have watched at least 10 times and look amazing in 3D.  \\"TNBC\\" is the only movie other than \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" that I know I have seen over a hundred times.  I bought it on VHS, laserdisc and it was the very first DVD I owned.  Not to mention all the merchandise!  The 3D edition I now own is gold to me.  Why would I buy another edition?  Why not wait a year or so for a 4K edition?  Is it an overall better transfer with better 3D?  Does it include a lengthy never-before-seen documentary?  Does it come with a book?  Is it limited and worthy as a collectable?  Let me know.  I love this movie so much, I might buy it.  There is nothing I have every seen that looks better to me in 3D.  It was so great it didn't even need it.  I wish they would re-issue \\"Corpse Bride\\" in 3D. There are not many musicals in 3D.  Only three I can think of which include \\"TNBC\\", \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" and \\"The Lion King\\".  I hope eventually a new live action 3D movie will be made before the genre completely dies again.  I'm hoping to hear more on this.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Title: The Ocean at the End of the Lane<br />Author: Neil Gaiman<br />Rating: 5 Stars<br />My Review<br /><br />My first thought as I dove into this story was that I was excited to finally acquaint myself with Gaiman's work. It was wonderful getting to know someone so beloved directly through his words. I had no preconceived notions (beyond one broken-up viewing of Coraline, the movie).<br /><br />And what did I think?<br /><br />I loved \\"Ocean\\".<br /><br />It was a fast and fun read and the story was never so convoluted that it felt like work following its thread. Gaiman said he wrote it intending to craft a short story and ending up with a novel instead. That seems accurate given that the arc of the story is rapid and fairly clean. It feels a lot like a great short story.<br /><br />My second impression as the story unfolded was that of a familiar ripple...a sense of dark déjà vous. I was transported back to my days as a young woman swimming about in Latino literature, desperate to understand its unique magnetic pull on my heart. Today, someone would explain that tug to me as \\"magical realism\\", a dull term for a provocative style. Provocative to me at least. The aplomb with which post-colonial Latino authors wove fantasy into reality was as beautiful and foreign to me as the aurora. Adrift in the stream of their tales I often tried to grip the vision and force it to take form, only to have it slip away, dancing more at the edges of my mind (like a hunger bird) than at its center. It was some of the most challenging storytelling I'd ever encountered.<br /><br />\\"Ocean\\" struck me as a beautiful bit of magical realism. I know that magical realism is not a genre, but in some ways I feel like it should be. To call Ocean simply \\"fantasy\\" overlooks all of the other elements that make it great...and for those seeking dragons and warlocks, it will be a miss. To call it \\"ya\\" overlooks the fact that it is, in fact, the story of an adult. I feel that magical realism is themost accurate description that I can give.<br /><br />And in the tradition of the greats in this style (Allende, Marquez, Llosa, Oki), this story is dark. Though it is told mostly from the point of view of a young child and features fantastical things both good and evil, it's fairy-tale like elements are in the old-school style of ACTUAL danger and strife. Consider the difference between the original LITTLE MERMAID and the Disney version, for example. I love both, but when you get into magical realism, there's is always an opacity or complexity to the hybrid world. It makes me squint as if the entire thing were filmed in darkness, a la Pan's Labyrinth. There is no rescuing glitter or sparkle. Though there are \\"good\\" guys in whom you, like the narrator, place all your faith, you still sense that the evils are darker and stronger because they are INSIDE him<br /><br />********Small Spoiler Alert - Some Details Included*******************<br /><br />I love the way that this type of story allows you to feel the \\"lessons\\" often inherent in fairy-tales, but as in the style of an adept fairy-tale, the lessons are just part of the overall weave. For me, the critical moment for this character is when the hunger birds send the hallucination of his father and he finally says what he'd wanted to say in real life...that his father is abusive and his vitriol is damaging him. I also appreciated later how Gaiman reconciles this tension some through the lens of adulthood: the child understanding, finally, that he wasn't the son his father had really wanted or understood. Gaiman doesn't try to make it all better and tra-la-la, it's more of a factual assessment than a lead-up to teary reconciliations.<br /><br />The primary villain, the \\"flea\\" Ursula (Why do Ursula's get such a bad rap?) is an excellent portrayal, shown through a child's eyes. It's important in this type of story that the villain be as she is, with the \\"monstrous\\" part of her nature being more human than otherworldly- her encouragement of adultery and child abuse, her focus on self and material or personal gratifications, her drawing joy from rendering others powerless. When you see her \\"other\\" nature behind the facade, it's suitably horrifying, but it also serves as the reminder that utterly human villains are the most frightening, in the end. What lies beneath, if you will...<br /><br />And the importance of the \\"Ocean\\", in the end. It is the brass ring of human consciousness, in my opinion, and yet, as Lettie tells us, we cannot withstand it. Without giving a spoiler that ruins things, the \\"Ocean\\" represents that critical dichotomy between what we believe we want and what we actually want...or perhaps, can survive.<br /><br />Sundry Additional Thoughts<br /><br />I think Gaiman's handling of the seven-year-old protagonist is excellent. His fears, his feelings, his impressions, and his dialogue all ring true. He even captured the very literal nature of this age group.<br /><br />The epigraph with Sendak is, of course, absolutely perfect, as Gaiman himself expressed in his acknowledgement. Sendak HAS to come to mind with this story, there's just no getting around it.<br /><br />The storytelling is incredibly well done. Surprise, right? The foreshadowing and references are subtle enough that though the \\"reveal\\" doesn't come as a total surprise, you haven't been beat to death with it the moment it happens. That's nailing it, IMHO.<br /><br />I also love the cover. It's perfect and haunting. I see the entire story through this lens.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />I recommend this book very highly to anyone who enjoys a great story. It is suitable for any age, though you may want to read or discuss this with elementary-aged children as there are a couple scenes that could be scary for children the same age as the protagonist. It is fantastical and lovely. I'm very glad I stepped off my usual sci-fi and dystopian superhighway to read this excellent book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This has to be the most fun running game ever. It is fun for all ages and it is for free. It may take a bit to download, but it is definitely worth it. Me and brother play all the time.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really enjoyed this download. It especially like how you can mix & match different sounds to match your current feelings and mood. You can't go wrong with having this on your kindle.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is an incredible story of life in a North Korean prison camp, a daring escape, and adjustment to life in the free world.  I especially appreciated that Blaine Harden included a lot of information about conditions in North Korea which gave some much needed context for the story.  I found the very end of the book most interesting when the author wrote about he apathy of the South Koreans and the economic realities that prevent them from being more active in helping those from the north.  Overall, a very good read.  It's an amazing stroy, well-written, and informative.
B00C061I3K|3.0|Being a huge fan of Alive 2007 (the best electronic mix of 2007 period) I had high hopes for Daft Punks latest. Sadly it came up well short of expectations. You have to just accept it for what it is: a way too disco-ish compilation that leaves EDM fans thinking, \\"why did I buy this again?\\" There are a few quality tracks spread out over the length, but they are few and far between. I've been putting this in my bedroom CD player when I go to sleep, so basically it sounds much better there than it does on my powerful living room stereo system. Try it out if your a fan of the retro sounds. Just don't come into it with high hopes like I did.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great App for my phone.  Easy to move through it.  Easy to download items.  Easy to read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first I thought this game was like 100 floors I was wrong.  You can explore the rooms more.  I like this game better than 100 floors. I can't wait for more floors to open up.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I'm really starting to get into it. If you do not like it after a couple of episodes, give it a few more. It kinda grows on you!
B008CPZNL6|3.0|You'll 5 whole stars if you fix the crashing, which happens whenever I try to add new content.  Also being forced to make a new account blows.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|My brother had me to buy this for him.  He says it was a great movie.  It sounded like something I will have to borrow and watch.
B003RNXIBK|3.0|I would have to say that this may be the least of my favorite albums of his although it's wonderful that he is in recovery from drug addiction. I'm sure it's probably a lot tougher trying to learn how to do everything without drugs, especially being in the public eye. But I felt this album was more cold and cruel than his last albums, but I guess that's what happens when you have to get to know the world again without the cushion of mind altering substances. I really liked So Bad, Space Bound, Talking To Myself. The rest I felt were kind of a cushion to protect himself from the depth of Space Bound? It's probably pretty hard putting out sweet, heartfelt lyrics to the public after going through so many public breakups.. But Space Bound was such a beautiful song- unfortunately the rest of the album is really harsh for me, and is shown through his portrayal of all these different brunette beauties in videos. The real question is, who is he really angry with?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very entertaining read. Interesting story and characters you believe.  The story keeps your attention and interest from beginning to end.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I heard rave reviews from a lot of friends about this movie and finally got the chance to watch it.  I'd say it's just okay.  Jennifer Lawrence was great.  Oscar-worthy?  Eh...  The movie seemed like it was improv a lot of the time.  But I guess that shows the true talent of these actors.  But overall, it was just ok.  Overall, forgettable.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I felt like this book was rushed and many details were left out. It was not what I was expecting. The ending was disappointing. Not because of who Sookie ended up with, but because I feel that there was no closure. I wasn't satisfied after reading the last book in an entire series. That's not a good thing. I'd rather that the author made an effort to bring her fans some closure as to the world of Sookie.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|I love Stephen King novels as a rule.  A big fan.  The thing is, King writes in American.  Not English, American.  No problem with that, except, as someone who has a degree in foreign language, it is my guess that Amazon has Engrish speakers doing the editing of the Kindle editions (on this and other Kindle books).  It's like someone sneaking up and grabbing your hair and yanking it out of the book, to be reading something in American/English and to have a sudden Engrish-ism jar you.<br /><br />Are you sure that you wanted a review, Amazon?
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|[[ASIN:B00B7FOQCK [Ultra Mini & Cord-Free Power] Anker® Uspeed USB 3.0 4-Port Compact Hub - 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.4 inches (L x W x H) - Backward Compatible with USB 2.0 / 1.1]]I got this a few weeks ago but just hooked it up this past Friday.  Worked like a charm, easy to install.  I would buy another one if I needed it.  It is small and does not take up a lot of space, but does the job you need it to do.  This is great, and the price was very reasonable.  I would recommend this if you just need a few more ports.
B005DC68NI|5.0|So much to say about this book! I have pages of notes, but the TOC makes finding information very easy (as do the bookmarks on the Kindle) and the appendix. The author provides the reader with lots of information supported by his personal experiences and the anecdotes of 33 successful indie publishers (I love the idea of being an indie publishing). Who knew? The links take me directly to the author's recommended site/page and take me back to the text thereafter. What's not to like? This book is filled with history, information on the current state of the publishing industry, lots of insight into the &#34;real world of traditional publishing&#34; with a thorough explanation of why there is no better time than NOW to self-publish. This book is mesmerizing, fascinating, and very well put together. David Gaughran covers everything you can think of (writing, editing, formatting, marketing) and things you might not have thought of (how best to use social media, what price should you set your book/short stories, how reliable are agents who turned to publishing, and more). I also love that he promotes short stories - I love to read and write those as well! An absolutely invaluable book!!
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Great new album by Simon and his band. There is pop infused with enough prog to satisfy this progger. The comparisons to Genesis will be made and with good reason. This band is one to watch in the future if they continue along this musical path. Recommended.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I was not really interested in watching this movie until a friend from work recommended it. Taking his advice, I rented it on amazon streaming and we had family movie night. It was great. I only wish I had a large HD flat screen to really take advantage of this visually stunning movie.  James Franco and cast deliver good performances as well. 5 stars in the family movie category!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is another view of life in Afghanistan from the viewpoint of families. He started with a boy in &#34;The Kite Runner', with women in &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and now this. Beautiful, touching and enthralling. I loved every page of this book.
B008133MDK|5.0|loved the actors and the story lines. I hope you can find more seasons.  i want to see what happens next.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love this album. First to last song.  I know it was overplayed, but it's because it's got great anthem songs.
B00499QUK2|4.0|i watched the second season first. had to go back and see what started the relationships of all the players.
B00BZBPRBA|5.0|This is a very clever and entertaining family movie.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry---entertainment at it's best.  Don't pass this one up and it's good for everyone in the family.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This movie is all that a movie should be.  A terrific story line,  beautiful settings, perfect casting, beautiful people and<br />clothes.  This movie does not insult the intellegence of the viewer.
1932735410|5.0|In preparation for taking the PMP exam, I enrolled in an exam prep course. This book was the required text. I can state with confidence that this book absolutely helped me be successful on the exam, which I took yesterday. I read the book, thoroughly, twice.  I also completed the exercises and took each practice exam twice.  The course I enrolled in emphasized the key areas to focus on, but again, this book was the point of reference for all of the course materials.  There were very few questions on the exam that were totally unfamiliar to me (perhaps 3, not bad out of 200 questions!).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amwesome very amusing I cant really express how I feel about this lol its amusing it gets me mad that I cant make it that far so it makes me try and try again lol wow its cool
B00DI75SWM|3.0|the product info section says this is a free app. But it says it costs .99¢.  99 cents isn't that much I just wonder why it's 99¢ if it says free?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Omg this app is awesome for a free app I mean it's awesome for a free app I wish it came with more levels but you have to rate it to do that
B001ANYDAO|3.0|After reading few chapters it felt like I knew the whole book. All the chapters were long, dry, and unnecessarily redundant
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I didn't like how it ended. they should have let everyone know they were married.also what about carys baby.waiting for next book.
1595828753|4.0|The feel of the book was great and it had good print and everything but it was way to short . I think that all three books had to be longer.
B009YMYGWI|5.0|BEST DONE VIA STORY AND CGI'S. MADE MY DAY. BETTER AND FASTER THAN FAST AND FURIOUS. HARD TO BELIEVE 3RD ONE IS BEST ONE.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Very well done for a 'stockade' type action flim, Arnold pulls it off, but not one of his best by a long shot. Cars, guns and waiting for the bad guys, it delivers all of this.  Predicable, but enjoyable for some of the stunts, action and gun play.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It brings you up and down<br />Makes you think do you really you know someone...and if you did do you want to!?!?
030758836X|1.0|This could have been a great book, but the language is so vulgar it made me feel disgusted!  Very dissapointed.
B000001K2V|3.0|very flat...laking quality, disappointed I taught it could be powerful, it turn out<br />boring, good to fall a sleep. Usually Mozart has more depth.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Somewhat unrealistic but excellent performances by many. The story lines are fun and fast moving. Sit down and enjoy and do not wonder why nobody knows he did not graduate from Harvard.
B000004166|5.0|It is wonderful ...the violin concertos are well done, good tone<br />I will recommend to my friends with no worries of disappoint.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I just could not get into this book - it was my book club's pick - several that are Jane Austin fans enjoyed it.  I couldn't get past the wordiness - too many words and not enough story.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|The points can be broken down into a couple of pages but the point is to drum these habitual inclinations into your head. This book does a wonderful of that with its elaborate and sometimes tedious examinations but its all very worthwhile. I highly recommend this financial guide to shifting your views on hyper consumption. This should be everybody's first financial guide book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun and simple to play!  My seven year old son loves t ok play this game.  He says it reminds if mario bros games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!  Was a little disappointed with the &#34;campy&#34; ending of the finale - so many other options were available such as a hunting accident.  Any way - looking forward to Season 4
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is a great read for an even better bargain. I was looking to read something intriguing and I found it here. I can't wait until D.S. comes out with the sequel. I'm sure I wont be disappointed.
B009XWD02G|1.0|Seriously? What a prank. Good job whoever made  this. It's just ridiculous and you want to peddle ads and not actually do what it is named for. Just WOW.
B008PU8SR4|2.0|I can understand why high school kids have trouble staying with this book. Story was predictable. The main character goes of into his own world on random things. I only read it because it was a part of my book club reads.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|You should download toca Boca it so much better than this one it's so fun but it's 2.99but it's worth it
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Black Sabbath's first new album in years. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler are three of the original band.They used Brad Wilk for drums and percussion on this album. Bill Ward the original drummer was not able to come to an agreement with the other members to make the album with them. It's always about the money some people say. Sad, It would have been great to hear his drumming style in this album.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A lot of fun and great sound effects. Most of the levels are crazy fun and sometimes frustrating at the same time.
B000002KE2|5.0|For $5.00 what a great way to get one of my favorite albums and support the band that made the heavy metal sound that all other bands have emulated ever since. Now if they would just come to Kansas City on Tour in 2013. I would go to see them. Even if I had to use a wheel chair. Buy music! Don't steel from your favorite bands. They don't steel from you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this books was a very good. It had a great plot and romance. There was sex and lots of twists and turns.  It defilenty deserved a 5 star rating.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I'm going back through all of my Amazon purchases beginning in 2001 and writing reviews for the notable products I've purchased over the years. By notable, I mean products that I am very happy with as well the ones that I now regret purchasing.<br /><br />In the case of this movie, I bought it in 2010 and it easily fits into the Outstanding category - I've had it for 3 years and it I still plug it and watch it on a regular basis. What's not to love, it cinematographicly captures the true beauty of Greece, big name stars and the best music from ABBA.  I would definitely buy it again and highly recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it.
0062255657|3.0|Seeing how many people have given this stellar reviews, and given that i waited in line an hour to buy it opening day, i'm feeling insecure in saying this but this just isn't a a \\"novel\\" worth 10-20 dollars.<br /><br />Prologue - An old man visits his home town for a funeral. His house is gone but he sees the old farm nearby is still there.<br />Chapter 1 - Flashback to being 7. Nothing happens.<br />Chapter 2 - Still 7. Still nothing happens.<br />Chapter 3 - Not much happens, but beginning to suspect something might.<br />Chapers 4-25 - They meet a magic woman. The woman causes trouble. They send her away.<br />Epilogue - Old man again<br /><br />He writes that this started as a short story but grew. It obviously did not grow much. It's 175 pages, which is half or a third of the size of normal novels these days, and it is roughly as complex as a short story. There's no background or character development as in The Graveyard Book. There are no twists or turns as in American Gods. There's no life lesson like the one you might infer from Anansi Boys. As in so many Gaiman stories, there are three women of different ages and they have Gaimanesque powers but what they don't have is a back story of any kind, nor do they appear to be related to the traditional three. There is no conspiracy of Jacks or substories about cars on icy lakes, it really is just a story of a 7 year old who takes a single, short walk in the woods and then has to deal with a well-meaning but odd woman. In a way, it's like Coraline, only with less depth and no supporting characters such as the cat. And Coraline was clearly advertised as a short story and priced accordingly.<br /><br />This is not a bad book. It's not nearly as complex, atmospheric or fleshed out as the short story where Shadow fights a monster in Scotland but it's better than the disaster that was 1602 and that awful teen novel Interworld. If he had thrown out the first few and last few chapters (the old man part seemed completely irrelevant), made an attempt at explaining the Hempstocks and included it in a collection of other short stories, it would have been fine. Alternately, if he had taken the time to have more than the 5 characters (the 7 year old, the 3 ladies and the magic woman), added one or two subplots (as he did in every other novel he's written), explained the rules for this universe (beyond \\"you kids get off my lawn\\", which appears to be the Hempstock ladies primary power), it could have been a good novel. But as it is, its a remarkably simple story for Neil stretched out to just enough pages to justify selling on its own.<br /><br />i read a review of this book written by Neil's wife talking about how personal this story was, how it was motivated by their separation and the problems they had. So maybe it wasn't intended to be a complex, interesting, thought-provoking story. But if there was something personal here, i'll be honest, i didn't get it. Even the theme i was told, \\"you can't go back again\\", seems shallow and silly here (yes, he can't go home, it was torn down, which is fine because he didn't like his home and has no desire to go back).<br /><br />i really wanted to like this book but when it comes to Neil's novels, his marvelous, unblemished record of great novels, i think i'm going to forget that he wrote this one.rrelevant), made an attempt at explaining the Hempstocks and included it in a collection of other short stories, it would have been fine.

B0002TJGQS|5.0|Surprisingly for the price, these are good batteries. They tested great on my voltmeter. So if you're looking to buy these specific 2032 size batteries, I would recommend buying them from MYBATTERYSUPPLIER (that was the seller I chose). However, on that note, I do have other comments... if you'll care to listen.<br /><br />Amazon.com is the #1 retailer in the world for a reason... Awesome customer satisfaction, excellent business plan, great products, amazing prices, etc... As we all know, Amazon has expanded their business to allow 3rd parties to sell their products on Amazon's website for some time now. With this expansion, they allow 3rd party businesses to either 1) use Amazon as a storefront but the seller keeps/ships their own stock or 2) they use Amazon as a storefront AND Amazon holds the business' product in an AMAZON warehouse.<br /><br />As a consumer, you have to be cautious when businesses opt to use option #1 simply because of the fact that how they obtain their product can vary. This especially matters when you deal with products that have expiration dates. Ever been to a flea market? For those of you that have, many of you know that various merchants at flea markets can obtain their stock through closeouts, business closings, clearance, etc. And much of that stock, especially when dealing with consumables, have expiration dates that are either upcoming or already expired. In the case of batteries, we all know they have expiration dates and it's a glaring concern that when you buy things like batteries, you have to be concerned about how fresh they are and if they aren't, how much longer they will last.<br /><br />As a final note, Amazon allows you to rate a 3rd party seller, which is a good method to help keep us consumers informed, but still it doesn't completely protect you from a specific product, as that seller's rating could come from some widgets that he/she sold in the past.<br /><br />So if you're looking for consumable items, such as batteries...<br />#1 - Try & use Amazon or a reputable seller. MYBATTERYSUPPLIER has a 98% positive rating in the last 12 months with over 113,000 posted ratings.<br />#2 - If you have to go 3rd party, try & find something that is fulfilled by Amazon (trust me, it helps you 100% more because you're dealing with Amazon support and not someone from someone's basement... especially for returns). If you can't find a good one, then go for one that has a very high positive rating.<br />#3 - Although price may be the #1 factor, don't go so low where you question the quality of the product.<br />#4 - Write a review of the product and mention where you bought it from so that other Amazon customers know where to go for a better experience.es...<br />#1 - Try & use Amazon or a reputable seller.

B000FBJF7I|5.0|If you have been to Africa, you will probably find this enticing book evokes the sights, sound, and smells of this amazing continent. The characters portrayed represent the many strong, kind, courageous, intelligent, intuitive, respectful, and generous people I have met there. I felt a return to Africa as I immersed myself in the story of strong African women solving personal problems of others in the #1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana. I found this book to be insightful as well as an entertaining summer read.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Could not stop watching the series in one go. Ragnar Lothbrok is the new hero with a strong shade of Grey
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a game that could use a little more info on what to do, it took a little while to figure out, but once i did I really enjoyed the the game.
B002KYGLVQ|4.0|Creative Orwellian drama with a powerful message. Natalie Portman shines. The unthinkable becomes believable. Excellent photography and plot. Highly recommended 16+ age group. More of a political film than one would imagine, not just another action movie.
B00AHG9KYE|3.0|Clarke is always entertaining and thought provoking. I just wanted a little more for the end of this series. Good but not great
B00498YZFK|5.0|If one would like to visit a rural poverty stricken area of the USA, just watch this movie and get out the map. This is a riveting drama with a twist or two and shocking Lord of the Flies human behavior. A must watch for those in the Jennifer Lawrence fan club.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to watch a movie about anything \\"slavery\\" or with the \\"N word\\" I don't like it.  But, Django was one of the better movies I've seen in awhile. Jamie Foxx delivers in his performance. I can't see anyone else playing Django. If you are looking for a good movie to watch.  I suggest you watch Django. It'snot a movie I'd allow a child to watch or a teen. However, I'm of age and I don't care too much for violence.  This movie does have some violence. If Quinton made a movie it's got to have a certain level of violence.
1936608898|4.0|Easy to read and most importantly makes you think. I'm going to buy a few more and give them as gifts.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|I chose 5 stars for this book. It is very exciting. I was in suspense in some areas. My heart was aching in others. I'm hopeful that in the next book that America will mature up and take responsibility for things that she needs to own up to. I am on team Maxon all the way! Easy choice since Aspen dumped her in the first book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Two of the grandsons love Temple Run.  They were waiting g for Temple Run 2.  The day I downloaded Temple Run 2 they play for 3 hours.  Their mothers finally demanded they share the Kindle with the other kids.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Very engaging book. Drew me right in and held my interest throughout. A very multifaceted and unique personality. Before reading this book I had had a very two-dimensional, stereotyped image of Keith Richards that was based on media stories and myth. What impressed me the most was his honesty and courage - he was not afraid to show himself, warts and all......the good, the bad and the ugly, like the saying goes. His love of music comes through loud and clear throughout the book. My biggest surprise? Finding out that he is such a avid reader, especially about history. My biggest compliment about the book? I felt sad when I finished it....I wanted to hear more stories about his life. One of the best autobiographies that I ever read !!
0061124958|5.0|Excellent book, which is full of excitement. It's wonderful to see how such a little girl cared so much about her pet pig.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We are hooked. Also likes Alias and other similar sci fi Secret Agency type shows. This is right in line. Sometimes the creatures are a little weak on special effects, but for the most part, it 'looks' pretty real.

B000SFD21Q|5.0|This book is imperative to all who may have even a little emotional issues, depression or lack of self confidence.  All women should read this book and especially those that are 50+ years.
