B00005K3NY|5.0|SCANNERS is another excellent entry in David Cronenberg's long line of body horror themed films, this time centering on a telepathic spy (referred to as a scanner) that has been recruited by a secretive pharmaceuticals corporation in order to infiltrate and destroy a terrorist group of like-powered telepaths. Ironically, though there is very little gore, the film is best known for the blood splattered results of its few scanner battles. Rather than introducing computer imaging or visual FX for these sequences, Cronenberg uses a brilliant combination of drilling sound effects and bursting arteries to convey the sheer mental strength of his characters in the minds of his audience. This effect couldn't have been achieved without the slow and methodical scripting used to reinforce the raw power and fear generated by the characters' mutant anomalies. Overall, the film is very good, but there are two things that cripple it more than anything else. Stephen Lack's performance is dry and unnatural, making it difficult to identify with him as the lead. As with most other Cronenberg conceptions, SCANNERS is also a very cerebral film that focuses intently on its strong social commentary, which can make the plotting difficult to follow on the initial watch through and slows the pace down dramatically. Though the theme bears a striking resemblance to FIRESTARTER, this is likely just a coincidence as the two films are dissimilar in many ways. These two minor grievances are vastly outweighed by its sharp scripting and clear direction, and Cronenberg strikes another major success here. His obvious statements against designer drugs and man manipulating nature are much easier to decipher than in many of his other films. Michael Ironside also provides one of his strongest roles as the vengeful Darryl Revok, which remains to be his most memorable performance for many fans. While it isn't Cronenberg's strongest work, it is certainly one of his most recognizable, and it goes without saying that this is essential Horror viewing for all fans.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesg that this is essential Horror viewing for all fans.    -Carl Manes  I Like Horror Movies

B000067FP8|5.0|Those mischievous little monsters are back in GREMLINS 2, and in a BIG way! Billy Peltzer has set off to New York City along with girlfriend Kate to become a designer for building mogul Daniel Clamp in his new state-of-the-art high-rise Clamp Towers, when he discovers his lovable pet Gizmo being experimented upon by local geneticists. Billy manages a quick rescue, but before he has the chance to get him home, Gizmo is hit by water and spawns another batch of evil offspring that transform into the gremlins and take over the tower! Joe Dante returns to direct this full-blown horror comedy after the smashing success of the first film, bringing even more slapstick and zany cartoon violence with him. GREMLINS 2 is bigger and badder than the original in many ways, although the timeless, small town vibe of the original is greatly missed. Instead, Dante lampoons big city industrialists like Donald Trump and pokes fun at the genetic revolution of the early 90's. Rick Baker takes over in the special effects department with an incredible improvement in the articulation and design of the new creatures. Gizmo and the gremlins have never looked better, and are given a wide range of new movement and abilities that make them even more realistic than ever thanks to the strict reliance on practical effects. Clamp Towers serves as the perfect setting for the mischievous imps to get their claws dirty, giving them plenty of room to tamper with the elevators, phones, and even their own genetics as they mutate into a variety of strange new creatures! Like in the first, GREMLINS 2 also offers a ton of hilarious cameos, including John Astin and the legendary Christopher Lee in small but brilliant roles. While many of the gags are downright goofy, they are never stupid and always funny. This is a sequel done right, expanding on the original story without repeating it, and introducing tons of great new characters alongside many fan favorites.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

Borrowing from project management practices and aviation safety procedures, he sketches out an outline of how anyone (you too) can start building checklists into your everyday practice. This is a very empowering book. I defy you to read it and not give a copy to someone in your hospital. You really should read this one.
B00004RJ74|5.0|The Geko brothers kidnap a small family and their RV as they escape to Mexico after a bank heist. Once they are all safely across the border, a quick stop at a local strip joint turns into a night of terror when the bar becomes a haven for vampires after dark! FROM DUSK TIL DAWN has two distinct personalities, the first being a brilliantly scripted crime drama with signature Tarentino exchanges and a shrewd dark humor, while the other becomes a gratuitous and mindless actioner. Most of the comments below are in regards to the first half, which is easily the strongest part of the film. Each of the cast members deliver memorable roles, with Tarentino, Clooney, and Keitel offering some of the best performances of their careers. The Geko brothers are perfectly written and played in direct juxtaposition of one another, and they are far more interesting than the one-sided vampires that replace them as the central villains in the second half. DAWN also boasts excellent cameos from Horror icons like Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Greg Nicotero, and others. KNB is sure to deliver more gooey gore FX, however their make-up for the serpentine vampires range from unique to downright goofy. Rodriguez brings the same frenetic energy to the high-powered gunfights in the end as he had in DESPERADO or EL MARIACHI, but once the action starts rolling there is an immediate shift in tone that feels quite uneven. The crossover into Mexico marks a dividing line where the plot becomes all boobs, blood, and bad CG. Despite the dramatic change the film undergoes, the lightning pace never lets up and fills every moment with laughs and blood even if it is entirely without scares. This match-up between Tarentino and Rodriguez was a sure-fire hit with most fans, and the film remains a staple 90s Horror entry that is clearly above average.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B00005YJMX|4.0|NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE serves as a direct remake to F.W. Murnau's original, and retains much of the same German Expressionist stylism while offering a new twist on the Stoker legend. Nosferatu serves as a physical embodiment of the plague, and his arrival in Wismar marks the beginning of the end for the small town. The Count bears a close resemblance to the rats that he carries with him, with Klaus Kinski's portrayal displaying the same haunting visage and mannerisms that Max Schreck had created fifty years earlier. Unlike Schreck, Kinski offers a morose and pitiful creature that has been forced to endure countless centuries alone, which is told through his sullen expressions and deep set eyes. In this rendition, we find an unlikely hero in the reluctant Lucy, who finds the world crumbling around her as the city succumbs to the plague and her betrothed Jonathan returns from Transylvania having forgotten all that he loved. Isabelle Adjani is stunningly beautiful with flawless features, and the stark contrasts of her make-up design placed within the dreary settings make her almost as ghost-like and surreal as Nosferatu himself. There are numerous haunting scenes of empty streets, dilapidated castles, and punch drunk plague victims that all contribute to the dreamy atmosphere and mood of the entire film. In the end, the film feels like a unique bridge between the Expressionism of the original and the depressing realism Jean Rollin brought to the genre in France. It is a dark and depressing Dracula entry that serves as a solid watch!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie not only looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray, but this flick is funny as $@#*!!!!!<br />No spoilers, but there's a guest that really amps up the laughs and the over the top performances are spot on, never going too far into camp. My family was laughing out loud through most of the movie. Zombies for laughs like Shaun of the Dead, Revenge of the Living Dead and the Evil Dead movies. BUT..... this is the new generation, funnier and more extreme. LOVED IT!!!!!!
B00005V1WO|3.0|Ken Russell delivers another case of style over substance in this opium-induced hallucination. Mary Shelley and others gather at Lord Byron's country estate, where they indulge in sexual fantasies, drugs, and ghastly storytelling. Their fun and games turn into lurid nightmares when they are overcome by visual manifestations of their twisted tales. GOTHIC is strictly over the top from start to finish, with outrageous characters and dialog that are stretched far beyond their limit. It is a circus act of sexual debauchery and dark Gothic imagery trapped in a lavish mansion setting. Russell carries over many of the strange and twisted visuals that he popularized in ALTERED STATES and would carry into LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM the following year, but it is impossible to derive much more meaning out of the overt psycho-sexual metaphors than the obvious in this overstated film. Still, it is a visually stimulating and visceral viewing experience, and many fans will revel in the flamboyant performances of its frilly characters. If you can find a decent copy, GOTHIC is definitely worth checking out, but avoid the inaudible and worn public domain copies that make it nearly impossible to watch.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B001S86J0I|4.0|I recently re-watched GALAXY QUEST after a roughly decade long hiatus.  I think it may have gotten even better with time.  If you wanted to make a movie spoofing the original STAR TREK series and the cultural phenomenon it has become...you simply couldn't do better than this film.  It pokes fun of the genre, the cast, the fans, the cheesiness and the conventions.  Often, rather pointed jabs.  But it's infused with real affection, and it even tells a pretty exciting and moving story of its own.    \\"Galaxy Quest\\" was the name of a `60s TV series that looks an awful lot like STAR TREK, the original series.  You've got the handsome, womanizing captain whose shirt is often ripped off to expose a glistening bare torso (Tim Allen), you've got the token woman working on the bridge, whose only job is to repeat the things the computer is saying outloud already (Sigourney Weaver), the alien with the serious demeanor and no sense of humor (Alan Rickman), and even the guy without a name who always beams down to the planet and gets killed in the opening few minutes (Sam Rockwell).  And while Engineer Scotty isn't directly spoofed, you've got Tony Shaloub as the blissed-out, mellow actor who once filled that role.    Twenty years later, these actors have little to do but make paid appearances at conventions, in costume.  Some absolutely hate it (Rickman), others tolerate it and for Allen, it's the highlight of his life...although at home, he's a hopeless lush.  These old cast members can barely stand each other, and lord knows they are pretty sick of never getting to do anything else.    Turns out, though, that the broadcasts of their shows have traveled through space and been intercepted by an alien race on a distant planet.  These aliens, however, think the broadcasts are \\"historical documents\\" and they create the science needed to perfectly replicate what they see on the show.  And now these gentle aliens are in trouble and so travel to earth to enlist the help of their old heroes...the cast of \\"Galaxy Quest.\\"    I won't say much about the plot, except to note that it plays out much like a Star Trek episode...it's a legitimate adventure story, coupled with a great spoof.  Will our weary cast members rise to the challenge?  Will they find redemption?  Can you guess the answer?  And because you can guess...your enjoyment should actually be enhanced, because the film finds delightful ways to surprise you throughout.    The script is very good.  The jokes aren't exactly Oscar quality...but neither are they cheap.  The film takes the time to develop real characters...and is careful to make the aliens quite unique themselves.  These aren't just cookie-cutter aliens designed to fill the needs of the plot.  We can actually see how these actors might actually take a liking to these aliens.      And if the script is good, the cast is GREAT.  This is a modest film, overall (even though the special effect still look pretty good even today)...but these actors are clearly fully engaged in what they're doing.  Weaver is hilarious, really spoofing both Star Trek and Ellen Ripley.  Often, I find Weaver to be a bit tight as an actress...very good, but lacking a breezy quality.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's relaxed and having great fun.  Shaloub is a delight, stealing most of the scenes he's in.  Sam Rockwell takes his manic energy and puts it to perfect use...he's convinced that he's destined to be \\"that guy who dies on that planet.\\"  Rickman is droll and understated.  At first, his character is seething with resentment at having to wear that awful makeup and say those stupid lines.  Watching his gradual growth is a subtle pleasure of the film.  And Tim Allen (outside of his great voicework in the TOY STORY films) may actually give his most credible film performance here.  He's not a great actor, nor even a particularly adept comic...but this role is almost custom-fitted to him.  He only has to be \\"serious\\" a little bit, and he can handle it.  He is called on tobe glib and self-mocking...and is able to muster than quite readily.    GALAXY QUEST was a real treat to revisit, and I heartily recommend it for either a repeat viewing or a first time adventure...particularly if you're familiar with what it is spoofing!
B002WY65VU|2.0|When I saw the previews for this movie online and on TV, I was really looking forward to it and pegged it as a theater-worthy viewing. I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and I got lucky.<br /><br />Now, this isn't a bad movie per se, but there isn't a lot that it has going for it either. It was billed as a zombie comedy along the lines of Shaun of the Dead, but it's not funny. Woody Harrelson brandishes plenty of weapons, but it's not an action movie and for all the zombies, it's definitely not a horror movie.<br /><br />There are just too many things that brought this film down from a point where I really wanted to see it and then when I saw it I kind of wished I hadn't wasted my time:<br /><br />-- Jesse Eisenberg is extremely annoying in this movie. I know he's supposed to be, but it's not the kind of annoying where you're like, 'He's doing a good job of being annoying.' It's more like, 'Dammit, he's so frickin' annoying!' It's one of the reasons why the movie has so little payoff. If you hate the main character, then why would his love interest and the other characters around him not feel the same way?<br /><br />-- If everyone is a zombie and there is no human flesh to feed on save the four people in a Hummer, then how exactly do the zombies survive? Don't they die of starvation? I know they're the undead, but surely the undead eat too?<br /><br />-- Why exactly do they need to go to Pacific Playland? To ride rollercoasters? To find some form of the innocence and carefree attitude they had before the epidemic? The one thing that supposedly drives the movie forward is this paradise of Pacific Playland, but there's no straightforward reason why that should be such a big deal. I mean, why risk your whole strategy of survival so you can ride the Giant Drop?<br /><br />-- The music is pretty lame. I like Metallica and I love Doves and Black Keys, but their music doesn't fit in here, especially in the scenes where the music is used.<br /><br />Not the worst movie I've ever seen (that would be Max Payne or The Avenging Disco Godfather), but most certainly not the best.co Godfather), but most certainly not the best.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|There are some corny anime cliches here, but for the most part, it's a worthy addition to the Halo Universe.  The best segments are \\"Origins 1\\" and \\"Origins 2\\", where you get a vision of the Forerunners.  In the game they are supposed to be linked to humans, and here, although it's ambiguous what they looked like under their suits, you can still see that they may have been humanoid.  Prototype had some corny parts, but the action scenes were incredible.    I agree with another reviewer that an overplayed theme was the \\"scacrifice mission\\".  Irritated how some Spartans die stupid deaths.  While some Spartans are supposed to be 'expendable', for the most part, they're supposed pretty much unbeatable.  Like one of them said in the \\"Halo Reach\\" trailer, \\"Spartans never die, they just go MIA\\"  Perhaps they should have more stories where it appears they die, but they're actually still alive, but you have no idea where they are or where they went.
B000035P5E|4.0|The book is always better than the movie.  I applaud the effort and the casting was very well done.  I only wish that some of my favorite parts in the book could have been in the movie.  My biggest peeve of all, that lowered my rating of this film, is the very end.  I hated the way they killed Die Needle in the movie.  That is not how he was killed in the book and the way he was killed in the book was brilliant and could have been a great cinematic death.  Seriously \\"The Eye of the Needle\\" is a great move and I would recommend it to others I just sometimes wish that screenwriters would be more faithful to books.
B001HN694K|4.0|Ever since the first film version back in 1903, Lewis Carroll's classic surrealist tale, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, has provided fodder for many a film studio.  While these films all have their charms, they do tend to be tough going for some viewers.  Part of this stems from the fact that the original story is very episodic.  The titular heroine basically jumps from meeting one weird character to the next with no real growth until she wakes up from her \\"dream.\\"  The other obstacle is the fact that Alice can sometimes come across as insufferable prig!!!   In an attempt to address these problems, Tim Burton tried not to recreate the novel itself, but to fashion a sequel of sorts featuring a now 19 year old Alice.  When she gets a marriage proposal from an insipid lord at a \\"surprise\\" engagement party., she sees a very familiar White Rabbit nearby.  She escapes the party and chases the Rabbit to the usual rabbit hole and falls into a new adventure where she not only must help her old acquaintances, but discover herself as well.      As always, Burton has a dark sensibility that actually works with the subject material and the art direction of this film is nothing short of spectacular.  This sensitivity also extends to the varied residents as well.  Danny Elfman provides a wonderfully quirky score to match the mood.  Mia Wasikowska makes for a lovely Alice.  However, it takes her about a quarter of the film before she really becomes likable. Still, she does help ground the film with an otherwise solid performance.   Johnny Depp is always interesting to watch, and his daft Mad Hatter is no exception here.  Unfortunately, his performance is not quite on a par of such more recent roles like Sweeney Todd or Capt. Jack Sparrow.  Part of that stems from the Scottish accent in his more serious moments that seems more like a gimmick than real emotion.  Ann Hathaway's spacey White Queen doesn't fare much better.  More fun is the voice work of British comedian Stephen Fry who is a delightfully suave Cheshire Cat.  Alan Rickman and Christopher Lee do solid work as the a hookah smoking caterpillar and  the Jabberwocky respectively.  However, it is Helena Bonham Carter who steals the show with her wild over-the-top turn as the wicked Red Queen.      The film goes at a rather leisurely pace that definitely picks up as you take in the delightful visuals.  The story starts out quite promising, but it does end with a climax that is very derivative. Despite all that, there is much to recommend for this version.  Diehard Carroll fans might howl at the liberties taken with this \\"sequel\\" but this is still a film worth seeing and recommending.

However, they are well used and rarely overwhelm the songs they feature on.<br /><br />Unlike its Dangermouse-produced predecessor \\"Demon Days\\", production this time is by Damon Albarn incorporating all his musical influences from projects as diverse as Amadou & Miriam to Blur and the results are simply staggering!<br /><br />\\"White flag\\" with Kano and Bashy, for example, features Middle Eastern strings sounds by The National Orchestra For Arabic Music (and anti-war, anti-crime lyrics), the groovy \\"Welcome to the plastic beach\\" (with Snoop Dogg), and the Dubby \\"Sweepstakes\\" (with Mos Def) both feature 9 piece brass Jazz group Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, while the twinkly \\"Glitter freeze\\" with Mark E Smith or \\"On melancholy hill\\" (with quivering organ and sixties-style harmonies) could have come off Blur's \\"Think Tank\\".<br /><br />Those seeking another \\"Feel good Inc\\" will have to make do with the dense future-funk of \\"Stylo\\" with Mos Def and an incredibly soulful Bobby Womack telling us \\"Love is electric\\" against a string back drop that sounds nicked from Michael Jackson's \\"Who is it\\". Womack appears again on \\"Cloud of unknowing\\".<br /><br />Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys and De La Soul feature on \\"Superfast jellyfish\\",  the guitar-drenched ballad \\"empire ants\\" features Little Dragon, who also feature on the 13 minute epic \\"To binge\\".

0061876747|5.0|In British author Boyd's (A Good Man in Africa, An Ice-Cream War) capable hands it's actually believable that a slightly depressed, mild-mannered climatologist chooses to go underground in a strange city rather than report a murder.<br /><br />Born in Britain, Adam Kindred has lived in America most of his life. Now, newly, devastatingly divorced, he's left his U.S. university job and hopes for a new start with a fellowship in London. Fresh from the job interview, he treats himself to a meal, exchanges pleasantries with another solitary diner and afterwards discovers that the man - a research doctor - has left a file behind.<br /><br />Good naturedly, Adam arranges to return it and goes to the man's flat where he finds him fatally stabbed. \\"Philip Wang lay on top of his bed in a widening pool of blood. He was alive, very conscious, and a hand, flipper like, gestured Adam towards him.\\" His last words concern the file. \\" `Whatever you do, don't - ` Wang died then, with a short gasp of what seemed like exasperation.\\"<br /><br />Going for the phone, Adam hears someone enter, and flees without calling the police, taking the murdered man's file with him. Reaching for his cell he discovers blood on his hand, washes it in a fountain, then feels the need of a drink. \\"...he needed to calm down, give his thoughts some order...\\"<br /><br />Incrementally time passes until it's too late. The police naturally assume Adam's guilty and the real murderer knows who he is. A vagrant on the banks of the Thames, he passes his first days assuming the situation will right itself, he will be cleared and the real murderer caught.<br /><br />But things don't work out that way.<br /><br />Staying primarily with Adam, Boyd shares point of view among several characters: the mercenary who killed Wang and now has a contract on Adam; the hapless CEO of the pharmaceutical firm Wang worked for, whose new riches come at a hidden price; the CEO's dissipated, aristocrat brother-in-law; and Rita Nashe, the cop who discovered Wang's body.<br /><br />The tension builds as Adam loses the trappings of normal life to blundering naivety, until he hits rock bottom and, starving, begins to exert himself. He has entered a world of muggers, prostitutes, hard-luck cases and opportunists and the way back - if there is one - requires an education in street smarts.<br /><br />It also requires detective work. The police are satisfied with him as their suspect and Wang's file is his only hope. The data mean nothing to him, but Adam begins to dig into the man's work with pediatric asthma patients, determined to uncover the secret that killed him - and stay alive to expose it.<br /><br />Winner of numerous awards, including the Whitbread, Boyd explores identity and the influence of social forces in this character-driven thriller. What happens when a man becomes unmoored from society? What will he do to preserve his life, his freedom, his dignity? What will he not do?<br /><br />The prose is muscular and straightforward; the plot is compelling and tense, the secondary characters are well-fleshed. Boyd engages the reader in his quest and while not everyone will agree with his conclusions, fans of literary thrillers should enjoy the ride.builds as Adam loses the trappings of normal life to blundering naivety, until he hits rock bottom and, starving, begins to exert himself.

This book seemed very formulaic (in a complex, convoluted, hard to follow sense of the term formula).  There were some interesting twists that I was surprised by, but overall, this just seemed forced to me.  Maybe I had overly high expectations, but I was rather disappointed by this book.  It is a read-once-only book, whereas the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons are re-readable many times.

142313494X|5.0|I know I may get blasted for writing this, but I have never been able to read Harry Potter.  I have started the first book many times and just couldn't get past a few chapters.  I have seen the first and second movies, I think, and possibly caught parts of others on TV.  I am not sure which are which.  They just never pulled me in.    Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief, however was a much easier read.  Perhaps this is because I am a poor reader.  Unless a story really grabs me, I find myself reading the same page over and over again, trying to remember what it said.  Too many flowery words and long descriptions really lose me and my mind wanders.  I am not a good visualizer, so these words are wasted on me.  I did not have this problem with Percy Jackson.    My 9 year old son has the same aversion to reading as I do, and this is the first book/series that he has not been able to put down.  I am very excited to see him with one of these books in his hands all the time.  He also tried the Harry Potter series and actually made it halfway through book 4, but with a lot of prodding to keep reading---mostly because he has to read for school.    All in all, for those of us who like a good story that is easy to read, it is excellent.  People, like me and my son, who have difficulty sticking with a book, will find this an easy one.    Also, as a note, I am a 41 year old mother with a degree in Electrical Engineering and have had a successful career.  However, reading has always been my weakness.  I guess I tend toward the books that many critics blast for being poorly written.  Those are the books that are easy for me to read.  Yes, I did like the Twilight series...another easy read for me.  So I welcome these writers.  They write books I can read. I am sorry that many of the classics or highly accclaimed books are difficult for me, but it is nice to know there are books out there for everyone.
B00328G4V6|4.0|61 minutes (unless you purchased the edition with  extra tracks) in length approximately.  The sound is good,especially considering these tracks were recorded with,possibly,no immediate thought of release.  The disc snaps in inside the fold-out cardboard holder.  The additional info (who plays what and when recorded) and color and b&w photos in the enclosed 22 page booklet are well done and nice to have,especially for the price.  The entire background story of all the tracks (except the 2 \\"bonus\\" tracks) is laid out pretty well.  Speaking of that,there is an edition out there with 2 extra tracks-\\"Slow Version\\",and \\"Trash Man\\",both instrumentals (more likely unfinished backing tracks) from 1969 available through Target.  The tracks are similar to the regular set available everywhere,but for the same money listeners get 12 or so extra minutes of Hendrix,but if you've already purchased the regular edition-don't fret,you're not missing a whole lot.  There's information on these two tracks in the \\"snap-in\\" portion (behind the CD) of the cardboard holder.<br /><br />Well,here it is,the \\"new\\" Jimi Hendrix album.  It consists of tracks,mostly recorded in 1969,put together by the Hendrix family.  In that respect it's much like \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\",or \\"South Saturn Delta\\".  And while the tracks are previously unreleased,a number of titles will be familiar to Hendrix listeners.  And,while having another look into the musical world of Jimi Hendrix can still be an exciting thing,somehow this release (along with several other re-releases of original period albums-now with a DVD included,and all at a new low price) feels much like a purely money-making venture.  Maybe it's to advertise the partnership with Sony Music.  Maybe it's to introduce some of his finest albums to a younger generation.  Maybe it's both.  And I say this from the perspective of someone who's lucky (and old) enough to have first heard Hendrix on vinyl.  Who witnessed Hendrix live,both at the Fillmore,and in my home town (parts of \\"Hendrix In The West\\" supposedly),and came away astounded.  So Hendrix listeners will have to decide whats worth purchasing-again.<br /><br />This album does contain some good music,even familiar tracks (\\"Stone Free\\",\\"Sunshine of Your Love\\",\\"Red House\\"-even though the fadeout is irritating) have something to offer the long time (like me) Hendrix listener.  And to finally have an officially released version of \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" is indeed nice.  As for \\"Mr. Bad Luck\\", \\"Lullaby For The Summer\\",and \\"Crying Blue Rain\\",listeners will have to make up their own minds if these tracks (among others) should have been released.  And (again like me) long time listeners will have a list of tracks that could have been released in place of some of these tracks.  Maybe in the future-we can only hope.  But overall,the genius of Hendrix is woven throughout this set,and like most long time listeners,the more Hendrix (up to a point) the better-because we have only a few chances,here and there,to listen to any musical genius at work.  And the price (again,low to entice buyers) does make this set attractive.<br /><br />So,is this album worth purchasing?  Absolutely.  The \\"finished\\"/unfinished tracks all have their strengths and weaknesses.  In that respect it's similar to other posthumously released studio tracks-an aural insight into the music of Jimi Hendrix.  It's a working snapshot of songs,over a period of time,that Hendrix might have released sometime in the future.  But it's not the album to reach for when you want to hear the real-deal musical statements of a genius.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has the voice of an angel. Her voice is so clear and pure, she has a great gift. The Album has a nice mix of songs and she sings them all so beautifully.  What more can I say, other than she is dearly loved by her many, many fans. We are all looking forward to a second CD.
B00328G4V6|5.0|So I finally got done listening to this new \\"album\\", and I must say that I was not disappointed one bit. The audio quality is very good, and the music is consistently great. While the songs on this collection cannot hold a candle to Jimi's classic studio albums, that's not the point here. This is still better quality guitar rock than most stuff that is coming out today. It is still Jimi Hendrix. I don't care what versions of songs have been released on other various box sets. If you are a fan of Jimi's virtuoso psychedelic blues-driven guitar wizardry, then you will not be disappointed here. If you do not own any of Jimi's music, then I would start with his three classic studio albums and \\"Band of Gypsies\\" first. After that, \\"First Rays of the Rising Sun\\" offers a good posthumous collection. This cd fits in nicely there as more great music of the late great Jimi Hendrix.
0451228731|5.0|This book keeps you engrossed. Danieal Suarez has made the technical issues so interesting even non-technical people can read this as well without raising an eyebrow.    Certainly recommend it if you like techno-thriller fiction.  Some aspects seem to be out of the possibility but when you look individually at the technologies that the author has mentioned you would think...hmm...why was that not possible.  I hoped for the ending to be more clear but it's ok.  I think he has continued the story in the sequel \\"Freedom\\" which ofcourse I will read.  Pls.do not miss this.

B001OQCV2O|4.0|The cgi is outstanding, and well worth a rental.  The soundtrack on blu ray is also impressive with lots of bass.  As for the story, well thank goodness they spared us the 'parent separated from their child spending the whole movie trying to reunite with them', which is so often the plot of many disaster movies.   And unlike most disaster movies where you only get a few minutes of special effects, this movie is choc a bloc with them.      So what's at fault? The story just misses in many ways. I wasn't happy with the list of who died and who lived -- there were some that didn't make it that impacted my satisfaction with the movie, and others I would have rather sacrificed. There were plot points that just got dropped at the end.  For example, so much was made of the little girl's hats I fully expected it to eventually have some plot point to them -- to be like the glasses of water kid in the m night shamalayan movie.  If there was a point to that, I missed it. And while there was some good vs evil themes and characters, some selfish versus altruistic moralising in the movie, the selfish really didn't get theirs, nor did the good really win. Much is made of the crassness and near evil of one politician, but he goes through the movie basically unchanged. The 'good' characters also seem to come through the movie relatively unchanged. So the movie ended more with a whimper than a bang in character development.      I think if they had worked on the story a little harder, as hard as they did the cgi, they'd have had a movie worthy of the spectacular special effects, one people would be rushing to buy. As it was, few of the characters made you really care about them one way or another.  It's not that the movie wasn't good as a popcorn movie, it's just that with all that effort to make the special effects state of the art you wonder why they didn't work equally as hard to make the story compelling. Why put all that effort into a so so script with mediocre characterization?Most characters didn't grow or change. Those that did change, did so inexplicably, like the bratty kids suddenly becoming nice?  Right, that's likely to happen. It was sloppy, hit or miss writing in that respect.    I also think it would have been good to go back to the Mayans who predicted the 2012 disaster and then bring it forward - seems odd to have a movie about the mayan prediction that ignored the mayan origin.  I also would have liked to see more flooding. Lots of volcanos and earthquakes, but not so much flooding, until the end.  While new york has been done to death, why not show london being submerged, the eye floating away?  That was a missed opportunity.  I also would have liked to see the end position of the continents:  a sort of pangeatic configuration. This was talked of, but never shown.     Still, even though the story was weak, I would have purchased the blu ray for the cgi alone, because I enjoy disaster flicks, except for the price. 24.99 is just too much. If the story were compelling and uplifting, that would be another thing, but for cgi alone, as this was, this will stay a rental for me until the price comes down.
0060566108|5.0|Jim Collins and Jerry Porras' \\"Built to Last\\" is a wonderfully insightful and thought provoking book.  The basic idea is that there are clear divisions between great companies and exceptional companies (i.e. the top 5% and the top 1%).  The authors spent the better part of two decades researching and       The best thing about the book is that unlike some other business management books which proclaim to be Gospel, \\"Built to Last\\" challanges the reader to come up with his or her own interpretation of the study done by Mr. Collins and Mr. Porras.  While it can be argued the facts speak for themselves, the facts are also at times contradictory, and while the authors make a clear case for their way of thinking, there is still room for the reader to make up his or her own mind.  As a reader and professional \\"student\\" of business, it is a pleasure to see the culmination of the research and not have to do any of the leg work to go along with gathering it.      \\"Built to Last\\" is an insightful look at the companies that have set themselves apart in their respective industries.  The book is research based and offers the findings of the research as well as the authors' interpretation for the reader to analyze and form his or her own opinion.  The book is not overwhelming in the least and is written in everyday speak.      All in all, a great, timeless, business management book.  Buy this book today; and get the hardcover (so it lasts).

Katnis is a wonderful heroine, able to face whatever is thrown her way once the 'Hunger Games' start. Besides having to face a lot of adventures, she struggles an internal fight of how to win without having to kill one of the other teenagers forced into the game. Truth is, she can't. But that is all I'm going to say. Suzanne Collins wrote a remarkable book and I'm really looking forward to reading the sequel.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|You either love or hate Michael Moore. There is - as far as I can tell - no in-between. I happen to love the man, because he is a filmmaker that goes after the bad guys with no sympathy or compromise - the way it should be. You can't be nice or make deals with people whose policies kill human beings. Moore has gone after them over and over with, for example, \\"Bowling for Columbine \\"(2002), \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" (2004), \\"Sicko\\" (2007), and he does it again with the fascinating and powerful \\"Capitalism: A Love Story.\\"    The film is really a compendium of many stories put together, all of them providing evidence of the destructive nature of the capitalist system. Moore immediately makes the connection and establishes similarities between the rise and fall of ancient Rome with the United States under George Bush II. From then on, Moore visits some folks that have been evicted from their homes due to the current mortgage crisis created by Wall Street, showcasing one fellow -- a vulture -- that sells homes from evicted people, and who says that he \\"got the desire to get advantage of other misfortunes,\\" claiming that \\"this is straight capitalism.\\" Moore traces back the crisis to 1980, when Wall Street and corporate U.S.A. got in sync thanks to the Ronald Reagan administration, laying the foundations for the culture of short-term profits and massive lay-offs.  He goes on to use examples in the airline and insurance industries, where these practices are actually costing lives. At one point, Moore says that if Jesus comes back, he will say, \\"Sorry, I can not heal your pre-existing condition.\\"  The film takes us to current times, showing how government financial deregulation created the current financial catastrophe, and how this situation let us to September 15, 2008, when the meltdown of our financial system occurred. Moore also connects these problems to all the Goldman-Sachs executives that have had influence in the White house. But Moore also gives hope, providing us with examples of people fighting back, like the companies in which the employees are the owners, and how people can affect Washington lawmakers with their votes.    \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" hits you in the gut. There is a lot of information here to think about, and to maybe take action. This is what Michael Moore asks, and this is really all we can do. The DVD is loaded with extras, such as \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma? It's Capitalism,\\" \\"How to run the place where you work,\\" \\"NY Times Pulitzer Prize Winner Chris Hedges on the Killing Machine Known as Capitalism,\\" \\"The Banks Kick them Out, Max kicks them back in,\\" and much, much more.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|What a precious film \\"Ponyo\\" is! The colors and its beautiful story really captivate you. Helmed by Academy Award®-winning director Hayao Miyazaki, at the Japanese animation film Studio Ghibli, this astonishing movie follows the tradition established by Miyazaki and Ghibli, with wonderful animated films like \\"My Neighbor Totoro,\\" \\"Kiki's Delivery Service,\\" and \\"Castle in the Sky.\\"     One of the main characters in the story is Sosuke, a happy kid who spends his day going to school and returning home with his mother Risa, who works in a senior-care facility, which is located next door to Sosuke's school. His father, a sailor, is seldom home because his job is very time-demanding. Their house is located on a cliff in a picturesque Japanese coastal fishing village. One day, Sosuke discovers what appears to be or looks like a goldfish at the beach downhill from his house. He picks it up, puts it in a bucket with water, and names her Ponyo. However, it happens that Ponyo is the daughter of a powerful wizard and a sea Goddess.    With time, the wizard takes Ponyo away from Sosuke, which breaks her heart because she loves Sosuke - and she also wants to become a human.  She escapes from her father's custody, unleashing drastic changes on our planet as a result, causing tsunamis, sending earth into pre-historic times (with its fauna and flora), and getting the moon very close to the earth, leading to possible, eventual crash. Only true love will allow the balance of nature to be restored.    \\"Ponyo\\" is just awesome. The animation is mesmerizing, as well as its attention to detail. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's classic `The Little Mermaid,\\" this is a film that all the family will treasure for generations to come.  The fantastic Blue-ray edition includes documentaries in which the world of the Ghibli Studios and the film's characters are profiled, interactive games, and more. A DVD copy of the movie is provided on a second disc. In addition to PONYO, the Disney Studios also released DVD editions of \\"MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO,\\" \\"CASTLE IN THE SKY,\\" and \\"KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE\\" on March 2, 2010.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Everything about this adaptation was wrong, wrong, wrong!!  But the worst part of it was the casting of Keira Knightley as Eliza Bennett!  What were they thinking!?  All Ms. Knightley could do in her role as Eliza was snarl, giggle or make herself so totally obnoxious that I couldn't watch the movie in its entirety.  Elizabeth Bennett was a high-spirited, witty and warm LADY and Knightley's interpretation was anything but lady-like! Don't waste your time with this version of P&P - watch the Elizabeth Garvie/David Rintoul adaptation.  It's true to the book and would've made Jane Austen proud.

0375703764|1.0|There's nothing wrong with this book that couldn't have been fixed by having Stephen King rewrite it as a short story.  The central conceit (which I won't reveal here in case you go against my advice and read this book anyway) isn't a terrible idea, but Danielszewski doesn't do anything of interest with it.  The framing story, filled with Johnny Whatshisface's hedonic adventures, might be titillating if you've lived in a church basement your entire life.  I haven't.

0061148512|5.0|I am not a mental health professional, and I claim no expertise in that field. I know this book speaks to many people about gender issues, and I'm sorry to give that short shrift, but I read this book from the standpoint of somebody who's had a person close to me commit suicide. It has been a while since I thought about this book, but I saw a friend's Goodreads review recently, and just coincidentally the Human Resources dept where I work has lately been active addressing suicide prevention. I can't help wondering what this book says about the experience of depression. That statement may be simplistic; depression may not be a single entity, but a constellation of different conditions with similar symptoms. I've read some distinctions between \\"psychological\\" and \\"biochemical\\" depression. The biochemical category makes sense, but the more I read about \\"psychological\\" depression, the harder it is to believe anybody really knows what is meant by that term. Maybe it just represents forms of biochemical depression that haven't been elucidated yet. Maybe what seems like a \\"psychological\\" component is just incidental. Legitimate grieving or life stressors may lower the threshold for biological depressions to declare themselves, but may not actually cause depression. From my lay perspective, this seems to make intuitive sense, because we read about people like Anne Frank or Loung Ung, who faced horrible and prolonged psychological assaults, but did not seem to be clinically depressed. I presume it's because they had no biochemical disposition towards depression. If Anne Frank isn't a case against the existance of psychological depression, I don't know who is.   One form of biologic depression involves insufficient Serotonin. That's a neurotransmitter, a chemical responsible for signal transmission in the brain. Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors like Prozac or Zoloft treat depression by increasing the concentration of Serotonin at brain nerve endings. Plath's metaphor for her depression as a bell jar makes perfect sense in this context. She compares her life experience to the rarified atmosphere under the sealed glass dome of a vacuum pump. It seems like she was trying to tell us that her depression wasn't situational at all, it was a perception of some kind of insufficiency. I have to believe this distinction was important to her. After all, the title of the book is \\"The Bell Jar\\", not some reference to any of the situational stressors in her life. As I look at the suicide prevention materials from work, it bothers me that there is no mention of this anywhere. I'm sure what is listed here has some merit: risk factors, warning signs, recommendations, etc. But there's nothing here about comparisons to suffocation, or a vague sense of smothering or insufficiency. I wonder whether anybody has ever investigated that as a warning sign or risk factor for suicide.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|I'm a big fan of Tarantino. He's always been a man I've respected as a film maker and his collection of films sit comfortably in my list of favourite films of all time. This is one he's been working on for over a decade, refining the script to create his ultimate masterpiece that he was hoping would match the perfection of Pulp Fiction. This sincerely did not disappoint and the wait made it even more special when I got my chance to see it for the first time. Tarantino is sincerely a master of cinema and although some of his more recent films, amongst critics, are generally hit and miss, this is genuinely a masterpiece and displays the man's ability on top form once again.<br /><br />The story unfolds over 5 chapters: Once upon a time... In Nazi occupied France; Inglourious Basterds; A German Night in Paris; Operation Kino and Revenge of the Giant Face. It tells of two separate plots to assassinate Hitler at the same time and place. On the one side we have Emmanuelle Mimieux, a cinema owner with revenge in her heart as her previous name was Shoshanna Dreyfus and she is the only surviving member of her family who were murdered by SS Colonel Hans Landa. The other side focuses on a group lead by Lieutenant Aldo Raine known as the Basterds are a group of Nazi killers who just enjoy killing Nazi's until they find out about a plan to hold a propaganda film premiere in the cinema owned by Emanuelle in which the Fuehrer will be in attendance. This group of Nazi killers are determined to kill the head Nazi, but the question is, will they even get close to their goal?<br /><br />One of Tarantino's main talents is that he has an ear for intense dialogue and can create a lengthy scene which has only that and allow the viewer to be gripped throughout. This is not different as the dialogue in this film is intense and filled with dynamic mood changes and superb acting. Sure, the fact that the dialogue is heavy with subtitles, they work in setting an authentic mood and rather than having the actors play Germans or Frenchmen talking to their fellow countrymen in American accents which would diminish the mood entirely, I personally preferred the subtitles. The first scene of the movie I see it as acknowledging this possibility of subtitle overkill by having Colonel Landa request that the opposing character Perrier LaPadite switch to English as his French was exhausted. Although there was a plot justification for this switch, it was a clever and I found it to be quite a humorous aspect.<br /><br />The acting is sublime, it really is. There are moments when it is slightly camp and the stereotypical traits are a bit over -exaggerated but they add a little relief to what is quite an intense film throughout. The cast are well fitted to their roles, especially Christopher Waltz as \\"The Jew Hunter\\" Hans Landa and Brad Pitt as Aldo \\"The Apache\\" Raine. They are both comically and seriously believable in their own right and add a lot to the film individually. The talk that Waltz should gain an academy award for his role in this film is well deserved and I pray he receives that nomination and ultimately the award. The supporting cast members such as Eli Roth, Mike Myers, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent and Martin Wuttke add their own individual flairs to the film to make it a genuinely pleasant experience.<br /><br />There is also certainly a western movie style influence with the film and you know it's a Tarantino film the minute it begins. He has an individuality with his films that allows you to notice instantly that he had a hand in putting this masterpiece together. This is definitely an Oscar worthy film that I would strongly recommend to anybody with an ounce of respect for truly marvellous film making. For the HD fans there are the elements that take advantage of this, especially with the beautifully vibrant scenery. So get it, you will not be disappointed.rs play Germans or Frenchmen talking to their fellow countrymen in American accents which would diminish the mood entirely, I personally preferred the subtitles.

B00275EGX8|5.0|\\"The Hurt Locker\\" currently stands as the most critically acclaimed film of 2009 and after seeing it just this week I'm inclined to agree this acclamation wholeheartedly. This really is a work of art from start to finish and has now been moved to the top of my list of movies to own and cherish forever. Since its release it has won numerous awards and has 9 Academy award nominations which they will undoubtedly win come the ceremony in March. The cast comprises of unknowns, but are ones with very familiar faces as, after doing a bit of research, a few of the actors have had very minor roles in other TV shows and movies so if this will be their leap to the big time, then it's well deserved.<br /><br />During the early stages of the Iraq war in 2004, this film follows a 3 member EOD (Explosives Ordinance Disposal) unit as they go about their missions in providing cover for one member, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) while he disarms IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices. James' behaviour in rushing into the blast radius without sending in the bomb disposal robot first leads to him being labelled reckless by his fellow officers, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This image of a reckless officer has a negative effect on the team dynamic and as the film progresses you become more and more aware of the individual reasons why each character is the way he is.<br /><br />This film doesn't really follow a plot in the sense of that the team must solve some form of deep seeded puzzle, or there is a mastermind behind the bombs that this unit specifically dealt with. It simply follows a trio of officers as they do the same job which is being done for real in Iraq and touches upon how those officers deal with the situations in which they find themselves. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, wanted the film to immerse the viewer into something that was \\"Raw, immediate and Visceral\\". That it certainly achieved perfectly as although some of the scenes may seem slow, they're slow for a purpose. It wants you to be aware that anything can change at any time and although there may be a slight stint of calm and silence, that can change in an instant and it was brilliantly done.<br /><br />Although some of the actors may be better known than others, I'm happy in a way that it isn't a cast of megastars playing these roles. In a movie like this, if you had a cast that consisted of the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon or Tom Cruise, for example, then the film simply wouldn't have the same impact. You would watch it for another purpose, rather than simply watching it for the story and that is why there appears to be this revolution of sorts with more and more of the most critically successful films containing unknown or little known actors rather than the big names. The film was shot in both Jordan and Kuwait and had a really authentic look and feel to it and the film is overall well deserving of any praise which it receives.<br /><br />However, there is one gripe I have about this film and it is one which was touched upon by other reviewers who unfairly gave it 1 star just due to this point alone. The way in which British servicemen were portrayed around the middle of the film was terribly offensive and overly typical to the point I had expected it to happen at some point during the film before even switching it on. There have been mountains of films that have done this and this will not be the last to make such a mistake, on the other side of the argument though, you would almost expect an English film to do the same thing to the Americans regardless of how serious the film is supposed to be. Although I did find this slightly offensive, I didn't let this damage my view of the film as a whole which I still support as being sublime.<br /><br />Shockingly brilliant and although it let me down in one particular scene, the film overall was superb. On Blu-Ray this film is especially done justice as thedetail and resolution just makes it visually superb in its own right. Buy it, rent it or watch it at a friend's house. This is definitely a film to see.t visually superb in its own right. Buy it, rent it or watch it at a friend's house. This is definitely a film to see.
0793563836|2.0|Great book? Potentially it was. The lack of tabs (diagram of the notes on the bass) in most sections and examples totally ruins what could have been an outstanding book. The author prefers to illustrate many examples and pieces in JUST traditional musical notation. At a minimum, the author should have presented both notation and tabs and let the reader decide. Some may feel philosophically that one must learn how to read music. If that's you, fine. More power to you. It's not me. I like tabs. There is some value in the book. That's why I borrowed it from the library rather than buy it.    If you desire a beginners book that does give you the option of musical notation OR tabs in many instances check out \\"Bass Guitar for Dummies.\\" Yeah, I hate the Dummies name too. Don't let that influence you. It is very well done, comprehensive, easy to understand and comes with a CD which facilitates both learning and developing a good ear.     As always...YMMV........

They didn't have the added convenience of driving to McDonalds and picking up a burger... and oh you want fries with that? hahahahaa and if that Caveman had KS.. he would still be overweight.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|I was dragged to see this by a friend of mine against my will and quite frankly I'm thinking of no longer being friends with that person. To sum it up in one word before I relive the horror. This was terrifying. Not in the jumpy or gory horror movie way that you may be used to, but in the creepy suspense filled way. Although it was filled with clich&eacute; moments and towards the end became a bit too over the top, it was still a film that managed to encapsulate the pure horror of what you were witnessing and retain it throughout.<br /><br />This is a \\"lost footage\\" movie which is one that seems to be a genre that is developing quite a trend in recent years. This tells the story of Micah and his girlfriend Katie, a couple \\"engaged to be engaged\\". Katie has mentioned that she has been haunted by a presence all her life and since she has moved in with Micah he has been determined to capture this \\"Paranormal Activity\\" on tape. The couple, after catching a few strange things, bring in a psychic who warns them that this isn't a ghost but a demon which shouldn't be messed with or things will get worse.<br /><br />Micah is determined not to let this thing beat them or be around forever so he decides that he's going to challenge the demon to communicate with them so he can give it what it wants in the hope that it will go away (see the clich&eacute;?) Micah brings a Ouija board into the house in an attempt to communicate with it, but Katie, being terrified of playing with this type of thing is furious.<br /><br />I'll leave it there as I fear I've given away too much as it is. The film is entirely from the one video camera perspective and over time the events get weirder and weirder gradually building the suspense to what you know will be a culmination of challenging this spirit or demon. The acting is sublime, it really is. From the girl playing Katie that is, the guy playing Micah is an interchangeable character that could be played just as well by anyone.<br /><br />The pacing of the film is near perfect. A previous review said that the pace was too slow, well I think this person was missing the whole point. It was slow and remained slow throughout as it is not an action/horror movie, it's a suspense/horror shot from the perspective of a couple experiencing this as it happens. It retained no devices to set the mood or anything like that, it allowed you to witness these events and fear for the safety of those living in the house. The couple did look like a couple and I found myself being scared for them and their experience which is an achievement.<br /><br />A golden film that knocks all the new horror movies out the water and presents something fresh and new. Maybe there's something to this lost footage type movie after all.evious review said that the pace was too slow, well I think this person was missing the whole point.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I've been slowly replacing my VHS collection, some of which dates back to my childhood, with DVDs.  My old VHS copy of this film had to be from the early 1980's and had been recorded off TV so you can imagine how muddled the quality was.  I was amazed when watching the DVD version at all the detail that I'd missed out on in my old version.  It was like watching a completely different movie at times!  But overall, I love this movie! What's not to love? Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews? They're the best. Plus all those familiar actors and voices from other Disney films of that time period.  The bonus features were fun too.  The DVD arrived in the expected amount of time with the expected overall quality.  I'm very pleased with the vendor, the delivery time and the movie of course!

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Reinventing Star Trek, a much adored franchise by all of its dedicated fans, was a brave move to make and one that few had ever dared and J.J. Abrams finally took the dream to the next step. Abrams, producer of the much loved Lost TV show seems to be the next big name in the moviemaking business and is truly a man with great talent. His last film, Cloverfield, was a massive blockbuster success and this, regardless of actual story quality, was bound to achieve the same. Luckily, this wasn't just an SFX bonanza with little substance. It had a story you could enjoy and actors that understood and appreciated the characters they were portraying. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto take on the most important roles as both Spock and Captain James T. Kirk, yet they play the roles with ease and affection and will undoubtedly take the roles into new and special areas.<br /><br />Established in an alternate reality through the medium of black holes, it must first be explained that this isn't a movie that follows any of the major continuity of the original series. This gives the writers the freedom to mess with the timeline as much as they want without upsetting the die hard Trek fans too much, although I'm sure they'll be upset by something. The story follows a renegade Romulan, Nero on a quest to get his revenge against Spock (not the young Spock, future Spock) for the destruction of his homeworld by a supernova which he blames on Spock. The revenge which he will get is by destroying Vulcan and then moving on to destroy Earth when he's done. This also follows the formation of the Enterprise crew as its pending Captain, James T. Kirk as they progress through Starfleet academy and move into space.<br /><br />The overall plot itself is, admittedly, quite basic, but it's the characters and the actors that play them which make the movie worthwhile. Chris Pine as the arrogant James T. Kirk seem the perfect fit as Pine approaches the character with a youthful ambition to succeed but a reckless mind that is easily sidetracked. Zachary Quinto took on the role that would undoubtedly draw the most criticism had it been played wrong, but thankfully portrayed Spock with a confidence befitting of the character itself. He expresses the perfect balance of emotion and logic that you would expect from the half human, half Vulcan character. There was not just pressure on Quinto because he was playing the much loved character, but also he was acting alongside the man who played the original character, Leonard Nimoy. The co-stars of Karl Urban as `Bones' McCoy, Zoey Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty and John Cho as Sulu do well in their respective roles. Anton Yelchin as Pavel Checkov, however, does considerably well in mimicking the accent of the original character but adds a fresh charm to it as his role progresses through the latter half of the picture. Eric Bana is bland and forgettable as the antagonist of the film which is a disappointment as Bana can really make a role his own when he wants to, but he struggled with this which is a shame.<br /><br />The look of the film, as you would expect from an Abrams film is superb. It's a slick looking film, and as you would expect, presents the futuristic atmosphere perfectly. They remain generally loyal to the overall look of the Star Trek universe when it comes to the diversity of the Alien races, the uniforms, ships and weapons. The new film has even managed to recreate some of the subtle humour familiar with the original series, along with the infamous redshirt character dying which was something quite familiar in the old series. Overall Abrams has done well. It's been a welcome reboot to what some may have considered a dying franchise, but there is one downside to this new Star Trek franchise and that is it may have been made too big, too epic to make a return to the small screen for a reboot series. If the movie cast could be drawn in to star in a series, then there's no doubt that it would be a huge success, especially if Abrams were at the helm. However, that is very unlikely and I do think that with this movie, we have seen the last of the great Star Trek series'. An impressive film with some amazing special effects and a young, talented cast which cannot go wrong with any film fan.<br /><br />It's only logical that you should witness it first hand.rams were at the helm.

B003097ABA|3.0|Aping the success of Sony's similarly packaged 5CD box sets, WEA is releasing over FORTY x 5CD \\"Original Album Series\\" mini box sets of their own. Issued in the UK and Europe only, the artists featured stretch from rhythm 'n' blues icons of the 1950s (Ray Charles and Clyde McPhatter with The Drifters) all the way through to Metal And Indie bands of the 2000s (Dokken and Echo & The Bunnymen). For those interested, I've compiled a full listing of titles in the series in the 'comment' section attached to this review (some are superb, some are not).<br /><br />Here's the fine-detail for THE CARS set - released Monday 1 March 2010 in the UK on Elektra/Rhino 8122 79828 1, \\"Original Album Series\\" 5CD box set breaks down as follows (none of the discs contain bonus tracks):<br /><br />Disc 1 is \\"The Cars\\" their 9-track debut album released 1978 on Elektra 6E-135 in the USA and Elektra K 52088 in the UK (35:13 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 2 is \\"Candy-O\\" their 11-track 2nd album released 1979 on Elektra 5E-507 in the USA and Elektra K 52148 in the UK (36:33 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 3 is \\"Panorama\\" their 10-track 3rd album released 1980 on Elektra 5E-514 in the USA and Elektra K 52240 in the UK (40:33 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 4 is \\"Shake It Up\\" their 9-track 4th album released 1981 on Elektra 5E-567 in the USA and Elektra K 52330 in the UK (40:45 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 5 is \\"Heartbeat City\\" their 10-track 5th album released March 1984 on Elektra ST-E 60296-1 in the USA and Elektra 960 296-1 in the UK (38:38 minutes)<br /><br />ARTWORK/PACKAGING:<br />The five single card sleeves reflect the 'original' front and rear US LP artwork - the gatefold of \\"Heartbeat City\\" is not reproduced nor is the inner sleeve for any of the five albums. Each front sleeve is also now 'bordered' with a colour and the label on the CD then reflects that colour code - Dark Blue for Disc 1, Orange for 2, Black for 3, Red for 4 and Brown for 5. The outer card box is lightweight and therefore a little bit flimsy (unlike the glossy hard-card Sony issues), but having said that, the card sleeves themselves still look pretty cool once out of the box. And it's also nice to see the original artwork used - it makes such a big difference on the Otis Redding, Paul Butterfield Blues Band [see review], Drifters and Clyde McPhatter and Dionne Warwick rear sleeves - beautiful original album artwork.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />Some CD sites seemed to have automatically 'presumed' that each of these sets is \\"digitally remastered\\", but it categorically does NOT state that on the outer box or any of the card sleeves or discs. Rhino have been contacted about this thorny subject by fans around the world and Rhino confirm that these are NOT REMASTERS - only repackaging of those discs presently in the marketplace. So if the album was remastered in the 1990's (Aretha Franklin, The Drifters) or the 2000's (Warren Zevon, The Pretender) then that's what you get - if they weren't - then you get the same dullard Eighties discs that have been in the marketplace for decades.<br /><br />With regard to this Cars set then - the 1st album therefore sounds great (done a while back), but when you compare the properly superb Rhino remasters of the \\"Just What I Needed\\" 2CD anthology of 1996 against the other tracks like say \\"Drive\\" or \\"You Might Think\\" (from the mighty \\"Heartbeat City\\" album), you immediately hear how dull these versions are - they're the Eighties issues that have needed upgrading but never received it. The best way to describe these CDs is that the sound is good - just not great.<br /><br />To sum up - if you don't own any Cars stuff then the 2CD anthology \\"Just What I Needed\\" is a far better buy (and better annotated) - but if you just want a slice of great pop, then dig in - just don't expect fireworks in the sound department. I'm afraid remasters of the whole albums are still \\"...just a dream away\\".<br /><br />PS: For US fans this set is an expensive import box giving them CD albums thatare already reduced to cents online... I'd say avoid.<br /><br />Also with regard to sound - so far the Little Feat, Bread, Los Lobos, Chris Rea, Dr. John and Rickie Lee Jones sets are also disappointingly reported as NON REMASTERS too.the Little Feat, Bread, Los Lobos, Chris Rea, Dr. John and Rickie Lee Jones sets are also disappointingly reported as NON REMASTERS too.

There were some less than stellar things about these DVDs: The commentaries by the directors were deadly dull and the outtakes were too few and not that good. The worst thing was that there were only 12 episodes. If you are \\"down in the dumps\\", those 12 episodes will have you crying with laughter and rewinding to hear parts you were laughing too loudly to hear.

I don't want to give away too much information but I would recommend this movie to all ages and especially for anyone who likes a good laugh.
B001DCQI82|4.0|In the back of the boxset there is a citation from a review which says \\"No mere re-run of the Nine, ...\\" making reference that, compared with the 60's cycle this is a new reading of the symphonies. And I admit it's true. But, unluckly, for the worse. In this cycle Karajan seems to be more woried about his mannierisms than in the previous cycle. Sound is more \\"round\\", but I feel that some fire, some passion is lost from the previous cycle.   Of course that I consider that Karajan is one of he greatest Beethoven's interpreters, but I don't think this cycle to merit five stars. In general the executions are good, but not superb, with the exception, perhaps, of the 7th, which sounds great and very powerfull, in my opinion.  Definitely, if you choose Karajan for Beethoven, the 60's cycle is THE choice.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|When I first heard of Disney dubbing Studio Ghibli's films for the U.S. market, I have to admit I approached them with trepidation.  I needn't have worried, they did a beautiful job with \\"Princess Mononoke\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\", \\"Spirited Away\\" and the rest.  So when I picked up \\"Ponyo\\", I had heightened expectations.<br /><br />As usual, the voice acting was first rate.  Clearly everyone involved with the project cared about the product that would eventually find its way to the shelves of video stores across the nation.  Ponyo itself is a beautiful film for the family.  I saw it in Japan.  You could call it Hayao Miyazaki's twist on Hans Christina Andersen's \\"The Little Mermaid\\", but that would be a disservice to the innate storytelling ability of Hayao Miyazaki.  There's far more here than a western tale told in Japanese style.  This is a story told with heart, al all to rare thing nowadays.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />There was one thing I objected to, enough to take a star away from what would otherwise have been a perfect review.  The film ended with a despicable re-mix of the \\"Ponyo\\" theme, featuring (gag) AUTO-TUNE.  Oh, the pain... the pain...<br /><br />So, I loved the film.  But the soundtrack will not be on my shelf.  Auto-tune is an abomination, and needs to return to the pits of hell from whence it ascended.

B00361HV02|4.0|In 2009, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club closed the final chapter on drummer Nick Lago, who was kicked out of the band after the \\"Baby 81\\" 2007 album and tour. Last year's excellent 2DVD/CD \\"Live\\" release brought highlights from that tour, and even though heavy on \\"Baby 81\\" tracks, this serves as an unofficial look back on the first 10 years or so of the band. In 2008, new drummer Leah Shapiro joined BRMC, and now finally comes the revamped band's fifth studio album.<br /><br />\\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\\" (13 tracks; 65 min.) starts off with the title track, which just oozes \\"Howl\\" all over. After that, we return to the 'classic' heavy BRMC sound with the up-tempo \\"Conscience Killer\\", and a slow-burning \\"War Machine\\", one of the best tracks on here. \\"Sweet Feeling\\" is a nice acoustic breather. The 6 min. \\"Evol\\" is another highlight on the album. \\"Mama Taught Me Better\\" is a hard charging head-on rocker. There are a couple of songs in the middle of the album that seem unfocused or misdirected (such as \\"River Styx\\" and \\"The Toll\\"). Towards the end of the album, \\"Shadow's Keeper\\" is a nerve-shattering song that comes crashing down eventually, wow. But we're not done. The closer \\"Half-State\\" is a 10+ min. epic song that will blow up the roof.<br /><br />In all, there are enough good songs on here to keep me coming back, but the album is overlong and would've been served well by some tighter editing, keeping some of the weaker tracks for B sides and similar releases. I've seen BRMC a number of times over the years, most recently in the summer of 2008 when new drummer Leah Shapiro had just joined the band. She will do just fine, as she also proves on this album. Can't wait to see how the band will bring these songs live.

The author has obviously done extensive research and was very detailed in her account.

0307341569|4.0|First off, Flynn's second novel is a very strange book, filled with odd characters in bizarre situations. But that's okay. She proved in Sharp Objects that she does \\"strange\\" very effectively. Libby Day is thirty-one and still suffering the effects of being the only survivor of the murder of her family when she was seven. Her mother and her two older sisters were slaughtered before her ears (in a truly horrific scene) and now her brother, Ben, who was fifteen at the time, is in prison for life. The undersized Libby has spent her whole life in the dark places. She's violently aggressive, pathologically lazy, paranoid, a liar, and a klepto. But still, she's not a bad person. Now the trust fund, established at the time by donations from a sympathetic public, is about to run out and she has to get hold of some money quick. That's where the Kill Club comes in. Its members are fans of -- or, more often, obsessed with -- murders that are either unsolved or in which they believe there has been a miscarriage of justice. And there are more than a few, mostly women, who believe Ben is innocent -- as he always said he was, and despite Libby's own obviously coerced confession. The club will pay Libby to go and interview people involved with the case, which is too good a deal to pass up in her time of need. So Libby begins tracking down people who were involved whom she either hoped never to see again (like her deranged deadbeat father) or whose existence she never suspected (like Ben's girlfriend). Naturally, there's far, far more to the murder in that lonely Kansas farmhouse than Libby could have imagined, and Flynn does an excellent job of bringing it all out morsel by morsel in alternating chapters -- Libby in the here-and-now, Ben and their mother in January 1985. The characterization is first-rate and the pace gradually picks up until the last hundred or so pages come at you at a dead gallop. In fact, I stayed up into the small hours to find out what happened, realizing there was no way I was going to be able to sleep without knowing. I can't, in fairness to the prospective reader, say too much about the resolution of the complexly interlocking plots, except to note that the author comes perilously close to a deus ex machina ending. It's a heck of a coincidence. But, as Libby notes, that's the Day luck. Anyway, I'll forgive a lot in exchange for Flynn's adroit and athletic use of the English language.re was no way I was going to be able to sleep without knowing.

B0031S4K5E|5.0|the minute i watched this movie with my 3 year old daughter and heard her point and yell, \\"ponyo fishy!\\" i was hooked.  i don't mind watching this show over and over and over again.  the characters are polite (which isn't always the norm for animated movies or other movies with children in lead roles), the story is wonderful, and it was easy to suspend belief and just enjoy the story.  i had to buy the set with the plush toy as i've not been able to find any online or in stores.  ponyo is my daughter's favorite movie (we have an hour commute every morning and every evening) and is also her favorite toy.  yeah ponyo!

I bought this as an 8-track tape in the early 70's and listened to it for about five minutes. I got it. A big flip of the bird to the suits. Hah! One star for the noise and five for the sentiment.
0670021652|1.0|Ugh.  I was so disappointed with this book, having high expectations after \\"Eat Pray Love\\".  I never skip pages, but I started skipping here.   I felt like I was in a bar where the person next to you has one drink too many and won't stop talking about the same topic over and over...  in this case, marriage.     I'm divorced and (happily) remarried so you'd think I could relate...  I'm glad to see Gilbert taking her vows *very* seriously but God Bless, that was a long-winded \\"I Do\\".     Save yourself the trouble and just buy a textbook on relationships over this.  There's no story, this is more of a rant than a book.

0307463745|4.0|\\"Rework\\" is one of those books that doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a quick read. While I didn't uncover any revolutionary secrets, I did appreciate the authors' attitudes toward common business practices. They have built a successful small business. They've eschewed the grandiose plans for IPOs, org charts that cover entire conference room tables, and all the other BS that typically accompany the \\"modern tech company\\". Their advice is, that it's ok to do that. Build a business you can live with rather than one you can sell. You'll end up doing something that you find worthwhile, rather than always chasing smoke and mirrors. This book is somewhat light on substance, however, it provides a decent antidote to all the demotivating process and bureaucracy that plagues business. Worth a read to be sure, even if just for the distraction.

0446569895|5.0|I've been a fan of Ozzy's since 1984 and endured lots of name-calling (\\"devil worshipper\\" among many others) in my dysfunctional Catholic grade school for liking him at a time when he was the world's prime example of a social pariah.<br /><br />With Ozzy credentials in hand, I will say that I both loved this book and I was let down by it at the same time.  I wasn't let down because of the media hype over the years (which turned out to be utter b.s., as is about 99.9% of the information and \\"facts\\" they pass on to the public), but I expected someone who was a bit more firm.<br /><br />I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but what I saw was a bit disappointing (and, no, I wasn't expecting the usual stereotypical stuff from Ozzy).  Perhaps it always sucks when you realize the people you attached a certain label to when you were younger turn out to be human after all (not that Ozzy ever pretended to be anything else but human, saying as much with his autobiographical song, \\"Hero,\\" originally a bonus track on the audio tape of \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\").<br /><br />With that said, I had tears in my eyes as I read every other page because he did NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, live what can be considered a \\"normal\\" life.  Things just didn't happen to Ozzy, they HAPPENED to him - times a thousand!  (I don't want to ruin it for potential readers, but your mouth will drop wide open at the stuff he's seen and experienced.)<br /><br />I will never listen to Ozzy-led Black Sabbath albums the same way again (always thinking of the inspiration behind them) and the same with his solo albums.  It was interesting reading about the inspiration behind particular albums and how the albums were eventually shaped into what fans have been listening to for forever.<br /><br />There was a certain innocence in this book (for all my complaining at the beginning of this review): John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne turns out to be a kid from Aston, Birmingham, England who made it really big and barely has been able to sort things out since he became a celebrity.  He never forgot where he came from - and coming from a celebrity of his caliber was a pleasure to read when you think of so many overrated never-weres who insist on being treated as gods.  I was surprised to learn he had so many siblings and the issue of indoor plumbing was a treat to read about in culturally superior England (in the 1950's, to boot!).<br /><br />The names he dropped at the beginning were mind-blowing.  It read like a Who's Who of early British classic rock.<br /><br />Two things really touched me: I always knew how much he missed Randy Rhodes, but I never knew how deep that love and respect for him went (and I'm now *really* baffled as to that accident after Ozzy explained what went down).<br /><br />Second, Ozzy's love of The Beatles, especially his picture with Paul McCartney with the simple caption, \\"My rock 'n' roll hero,\\" which instantly put tears of joy in my eyes.  He made me understand perfectly the impact The Beatles had on fellow Brits and why so many of them looked to music as a way out after they heard the Fab Four.<br /><br />It's got to be hard disclosing so much embarrassing stuff to millions of people worldwide (and especially with five children who, hopefully, are used to this by now and are past the point of asking, \\"Why, Dad?\\"), but Ozzy's honesty was refreshing.<br /><br />Besides his honesty, I really appreciated the fact that he didn't get on a moral high horse about quitting drugs and alcohol.  THAT alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The only thing I wish he would have addressed was the way he was crucified (pun intended) by those goofy televangelists in the 1980s and how he eventually won over that hypocrite Jimmy Swaggart (\\"Now Jimmy he got busted with his pants down.  Repent ye wretched sinner, self-righteous clown\\"), but he got his digs in at those losers at the P.M.R.C., so that was good enough. (Besides, how much can you fit intoone tome?)<br /><br />By the way, Ozzy: What was up with the diss towards Yes and hippies along with Scott MacKenzie's \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)?\\"<br /><br />Finally a polite warning: Do not read this book if you can't deal with descriptions of animal cruelty (even though Ozzy sincerely regrets it today).<br /><br />Thanks, Ozzy, for a glimpse into your life.  I will treasure your book always.  Now how long is it going to take to adopt this book into a movie?  - Donna Di Giacomohippies along with Scott MacKenzie's \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)?\\"      Finally a polite warning: Do not read this book if you can't deal with descriptions of animal cruelty (even though Ozzy sincerely regrets it today).

B00004UEDQ|4.0|I've seen this film a few times (I even saw it twice in the theater) and walking away from it I feel the same way every time.  This is a good film that just lands on the wrong side of great thanks to a few pacing issues.  You know, I really enjoy this film and find all the performances, especially Bullock's, to be strong and focused and intriguing; but the film has a few spots that just seem to lag along forever.  If the film had been tightened just a little (and maybe a few of the clich&eacute;s flipped on their heads) then this film could have been one of the best of the year.<br /><br />That said, Bullock would easily make my top ten Lead Actress ballot for 2000.<br /><br />The film revolves around Gwen, a grown woman who acts very much like a child thanks to her addictions to pills and booze, not to mention the strong influence from her equally immature (and self centered) boyfriend Jasper.  When she unintentionally (yet most likely not really regretfully) ruins her sisters wedding thanks to her `issues', she finds herself spending a month in rehab where she starts to find herself by witnessing the effect her life has on others as well as getting to see herself through others eyes.  The film may go in a very predictable direction (the character arcs for Jasper, Gwen and one unlucky patient are very `by the book') but it feels very authentic and relatable from start to finish.<br /><br />Well, except for the weird love angle involving Eddie, the baseball player.<br /><br />In the end though, it is not the script itself that gets the negative point, or maybe it is, but not the plot aspect of the script.  There are just a few scenes that needed to be cut in order to keep the film from lulling and leaving holes of disinterest.  It's sad when a film can grab you and then kind of push you away almost simultaneously.<br /><br />It's a balanceing act that this film didn't quite master.<br /><br />Still, the acting is rather remarkable, especially when you consider the type of film this COULD have become.  When you think of Sandra Bullock you don't really think of dramatic actress.  You think of bubbly and cute romantic comedies.  Well, now you think of Oscar Winning actress (congrats Sandra, even if NO ONE should have beaten Mulligan this year!), but at the time this was released Sandra was not really known for her skills in the dramatic department.  She SOARS here.  She really understands how to use her knack for endearing the audience as well as this rich element of surprise into creating a beautifully sincere character.  The ensemble is actually very well used, from the selfish sensuality that envelopes Dominic West to the awkward heartbreak that swallows Azura Skye; all the way to Steve Buscemi and the ridiculously underused Mike O'Malley.<br /><br />Of course, there is always one who just steals every scene, and here that is Alan Tudyk.<br /><br />I totally recommend this film.  I wish that I could say it was perfect and give it an A, but a B+ is pretty good and this film more than deserves that grade.  Sandra is a star (we all know that) and this may be her finest performance (although I am still VERY partial to her work in `While You Were Sleeping') so see it for her performance if nothing else.  Thankfully this film is far more than just a performance vehicle.of Sandra Bullock you don't really think of dramatic actress.  You think of bubbly and cute romantic comedies.

B002X9W50E|5.0|A nice collection of Bowie done \\"live\\" for those who are fans or for those wanting to discover his work. It is not a definitive collection, but does contain some of Bowie's highlights spanning his entire career. This disc shows the variety and depth of his ever evolving style. This 2 disc set recorded live is from his 2004 Reality Tour.  His trend setting work is performed with a new vigor and freshness that only a live stage performance can do. The songs included here cover an astonishing range of work both familiar and extremely rare.  Yes, \\"Changes\\" is here, but so are other favorites like an extended version of \\"Heroes\\", a great rendition of \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and the rarely played \\"Five Years\\".  Rare cuts like \\"Hello Spaceboy\\" and \\"Bring Me The Disco King\\" are found here as well. In all there are 30 cuts that you will find to your liking. You won't be disappointed.  There is a lot of Bowie for the buck here.

B001NESPHC|2.0|Melody Gardot's first CD (Worrisome heart) was a phenomenal achievement in restraint and intimacy. When I heard she was in the studio recording a full-length CD, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and give it a listen.    When the wait was over, I hurriedly picked up a copy of her \\"My one and only thrill\\" CD, slipped it into my CD player, and... was appalled. Gone is the subtlety, only to be replaced by the most outlandishly cheezy strings I have heard since I stopped listening to my grandmother's music. Strings, strings, more strings, and then just to be sure you have been sufficiently smothered in strings, well, more strings. It's as if some string composer wanted to use Melody as a vehicle for promoting his/her orchestrations, and forcefully took control of the recording sessions. I haven't looked at who produced this latest recording, but I will (just to add to my \\"avoid\\" list).    Melody, Melody, what have you done? Where have you lost that minimalist approach, those intimate moments, the under-produced and under-played beauty of your first recording? I haven't given up on you, and I am hopeful that your third recording will ditch the cheezy strings and return to the intimate night club ambiance that you so well embraced before.
B00275EGWY|4.0|Nah, the movie itself isn't politically correct, but its Oscar award as Best Picture of the year is an example of PC at its finest.  \\"Hurt Locker\\" was good entertainment--see my four star rating--but not top of the heap Oscar material.  It won because it was time for a woman director to win, in the Academy Award community's eyes.    It also won because it dealt with the Iraq war without being political or biased against the war, which is the kiss of death even in the Oscar community.    The movie itself deals with a team of bomb defusers led by the Jeremy Renner character, James, who's a little crazy.  He's gutsy and takes chances.  The incidents in which he disables bombs are tense and sweaty (even for those in the audience), but the most effective scene I thought was James's confronting a taxi driver who drove through the cordon around an IED right up to him.  Nice use of suspense and tension.    James is brave to the point of foolhardiness, which stresses (and eventually damages) his team.  But he loves war--it really is a drug to him, and can't see himself doing anything else.  No moping around wondering what's going on on the home front for him.    The movie was well worth the time and money to watch, as long as you heeded the R rating warning--one cadaver scene was particularly disturbing--but picture of the year?  I don't think so, unless the other candidates were a little weak.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|On a recent roadtrip to California, we were on Interstate 5 and passed an area of feedlots near Stockton - the odor was unbelievable for miles before and after! Some of what we saw in the film is stuff we may have heard about, but to have it all put together coherently brings the information home, right to where we can see the results on our plates and in our refrigerator and cupboards(and in the nostrils of those unlucky enough to work or live near these giant feedlots!) It was mind-boggling and disturbing to really realize what keeps our food so cheap (relative to Europe or Japan or some other nations,) so disturbing we couldn't even watch the whole film in one sitting!   Food, INC, should be required viewing for everyone. Americans must think about what we are allowing to be done to us, our bodies, our country. There are so many questions the film stirs up; Why are the corn farms still being subsidized by taxpayers? Why is corn ethanol being promoted by the government when there are more efficient plants(sugarcane,sugarbeets,some grasses, etc)that can be used to make ethanol, and on and on. . .?

B001GCUO5M|4.0|I'd have to see \\"Shutter Island\\" again to really gage whether it is above or below Scorsese's potential--my original viewing of \\"The Departed\\" was quick, rushed, and though I recognized it was above average, I made the mistake of not realizing how intricate and masterfully crafted it really was.  A long standing Martin Scorsese fan, I think his hardcore fans must have the feeling that the man's mind is moving in darker and darker avenues these days.  Though the end of this one is a little less \\"doom wins\\" then \\"Departed\\", it echoes a similar sentiment: mankind can never really grasp truth, and oftentimes lives in elaborately constructed avenues of corruption rather than facing the truth and dealing with it. Scorsese's grip on his Catholicsm has become tenuous at best.<br /><br />There are questions Scorsese deliberately evades to make us wonder a bit more.  What was in the cigarettes so generously passed out in the asylum?  Why are Max Von Sydow (echoing Dr. Mengele and the Nazi threat) and Ben Kingsley (with plans that may be real? for an unethical \\"energy treatment\\" of the mentally ill, echoing the A Bomb) conducting such a ridiculously lengthy experiment on this patient in particular?  How did they know a storm would take place before the \\"ferry\\" left?  Is the director also making a negative comment on the advent of psychotropic drugs, hospitals, etc before they were thoroughly developed and maximized by the state?<br /><br />The revelation about Teddy Daniels at the end of the film did not at all surprise or shock me.  There were times--for instance, when Daniels is questioning a \\"patient\\" about her role in the disappearance of a fictitious child murderer--where it seems as though David Lynch had stepped in to Scorsese's shoes to say: \\"Everyone's insane!\\"  The flashbacks to the concentration camps were so disturbingly effective that I'd put them on par with quite a few quality holocaust films, though of course it isn't *just* about his experiences at the camps.  Mahler blasts, roses fall, SS officers die, and Teddy winds his way through a psychological maze right to his own--also uncertain and vague--ending.  Why would a guy who shot someone under those particular circumstances consider himself a complete, unredeemable monster?  That was my main foible with the film--Teddy loathes himself *that much* for snapping when his children have just been drowned, etc?  His crime was capital, of course, but anyone could have argued for an insanity plea.  Indeed they could have.<br /><br />But this only points to the moral heart of the story.  We do not know everything, we cannot know everything, and some ideas of right and wrong, what we have or haven't done, can never be clearly and crisply answered.  This is the darkest Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen--it is to his film canon what \\"Hour of the Wolf\\" was to Bergman's: a thorough exploration of the artists' subconscious.  While I won't say at all that this matches up to \\"The Departed\\", it is certainly one of Scorsese's more vulnerable films and not to be missed.asts, roses fall, SS officers die, and Teddy winds his way through a psychological maze right to his own--also uncertain and vague--ending.

B0016Q2D5M|4.0|I rented this on blu ray to test my new HDTV, and got a surprisingly enjoyable film.  First off, the scenery shots are absolutely gorgeous, with waterfalls, mountains and oceans and especially the scene where they first end up underground with these flocks of tiny cute glow-in-the-dark \\"hummingbirds\\" (one of which befriends the boy) flying around in graceful patterns and the \\"sky\\" is all shades of copper and rose and gold...beautiful.  I kept pausing the film just to appreciate the breathtaking scenery.      The storyline, while simplistic, has relatively few moments where you think \\"it doesn't work that way in real life\\", since most scenes are given fairly plausible explanations (they're falling a mile or more into the earth and don't die or get seriously injured when they hit bottom because they end up gradually slowing down with the help of a \\"waterslide\\"-type rock formation).  Some of the humor is corny, but Brendan Frasier delivers his lines with such wide-eyed innocence that I kept chuckling in spite of myself.  I also got a kick out the of the end scene in Italy where the teenage boy starts imitating Italian while talking to the guy whose vinyard they accidentally trashed.  This kid spent a lot of the movie complaining, yet demonstrated commendable maturity at the end to deal with this unexpected situation with aplomb.     I also appreciated the geologic information, which I not only found interesting but I hope may entice some young people to join the ranks of the rapidly aging scientists of America these days.  I notice a lot of recent films for children relate to science/science fiction, which is probably deliberate, as they did the same thing in the 1950's, didn't they?  And that brought about the first huge wave of inventions like computers, space craft, velcro, cell phones, etc.

First, the author is one name: Sapphire, like she is so famous everyone only needs to see Sapphire and know who she is and that she is a world-class writer.lol. Next, Ms. Sapphire demands the TITLE have HER name in it. Excuse me, the movie is not about Sapphire. It is \\"based\\" on her soap opera book. The film is about Precious. A silly title that probably irked most everyone in the Academy and lost many Oscars because of the ego and pretentious attitude of \\"Sapphire\\".   However, the acting by all is wonderful (except for Ms. \\"Glitter\\" Maria). Sandra Bullock and the Academy should be ashamed for taking the Oscar from the lead of Precious. Precious is pure fiction but at least it doesn't pretend to be real like \\"The Blind Side\\". Precious is a good film (only for the acting) with a stupid label and contrived-for-tears storyline. Someone PUSH Ms. Sparkling Red Ego over a cliff.
B001O05X2U|5.0|The first time I ever heard anything from Mika was when my younger sister showed me the video for Happy Ending. I was so distracted and impressed with the video itself that I didn't pay too much attention to the song. (I sadly tend to do that a lot.) About a month or so later, I thought, \\"What was that song with the really cool video?\\" and ended up searching all over for it until I ended up listening to the entire album via youtube. I fell in love. Since then, Mika has been one of my favorite artists of all time. (Which is something I can't really say about most pop artists out there. Not to mention, my taste in music normally falling under the Danny Elfman/Oingo Boingo or They Might Be Giants category...)<br /><br />I love everything about this album, from the lyrics to the music, his voice... The songs are all very catchy and fun, including the more depressing ones. One probably wouldn't notice how pessimistic \\"Lollipop\\" (which has become my personal favorite) is on their first listen. The songs are very easy to relate to (at least for me) and make me feel like running around the streets, bursting out in song.<br /><br />I wish I could put it into better words. But yes, I love this album and I'd recommend it to anyone. Five stars.

Like others have said, its not quite the genius that Demon Day's was but it still does have some really good tracks. I'm not sure this album has songs that will have the main stream appeal like Feel Good Inc., but if you like good music it is definitely worth checking out. Check out the video for stylo on youtube, Bruce Willis has a cameo, very good. All said and done I wish that Damon Albarn would have brought Del the Funky Homosapien or Danger Mouse back for at least a track (preferably on the same track), here's to wishing for their return on the next gorillaz album.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|This season is really good - it establishes a cool story in a very interesting setting. It's got a loosely underlying plot theme that eventually plays out with a somewhat shocking twist. However, there are some boring episodes that prevent this season from being truly great. It does a good job setting up the vastly superior second season, though. The video quality is fantastic for a standard dvd and there are some decent extras. If you are on the fence about starting to watch this series, then pick this season up when it is cheap. You will enjoy it and it will allow you to follow the plot and know the characters as you start the second season. Viewer beware, however, as this show is not for the faint of heart. Violence, nudity, profanity - it really pushes the limit as far as what previous television has shown in these departments.
B00328G4V6|3.0|(3 & ½ stars) With this newest Hendrix posthumous collection (the 56th since his death?), the compilers have done a very good job of putting together a set of songs that holds together as an album rather than just a rarities grab bag.  The playing is very solid throughout the album, with songs such as \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" showing how Hendrix's force and power carried on down the years.  On that tune, it's easy to hear who Stevie Ray Vaughn's major influence was!  Much is made of these recordings being \\"never before released songs,\\" but many of them are alternate versions of songs we've heard elsewhere (ex., \\"Stone Free\\").  What that means is that, while Neptune does work well as a stand-alone album, it also does not have the impact of one of the original Hendrix albums; i.e., those released before or immediately after his death.  There are a couple of \\"new\\" cover songs that are completely worth hearing, especially a stab at Cream's \\"Sunshine of My Love\\" that suffers only slightly from an over-extended percussion break in the middle.  In sum, Valleys of Neptune is a must-buy for diehard Jimi buffs (needless to say), but even more casual fans - and rock history buffs - will find it worth a listen.<br /><br />A final editorial note addressing the oddity that is the ubiquitous 5-star customer reviews for everything on Amazon.  For those who give Neptune 5 stars (and that WILL happen), they are saying this album is just as good as Are You Experienced, Ladyland, and the other masterworks of Hendrix's career.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  I love pizza, but I would not give every pizza I ever ate the top rating.  I really like Steven Spielberg, but I would not give EVERY movie he ever made an identical 5-star rating!  I guess people simply lack the ability to distinguish between the good, the great, and the best.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A very real film on our corrupt government & corportate driven food system. It's one that everyone should see (with their kids). We need to start unsing our \\"three votes\\" wisely!!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I grew up on this series and love it to this day. My wife's birthday is coming up and I just bought her the whole series so she doesn't have to wait for it to come on the television. I don't know if that was a wise purchase on my part... Maybe I'll get my wife away from the TV in a Month or so after she's done watching it all. Anyway, this is one of those shows that cannot be dimmed by time. It has great story lines and virtuous themes such as courage to stand up for what is right even if it puts your own safety or happiness on the line. Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman is a very clean show as well. I will have no reservations in letting my young children watch it as soon as they come along. This is a set you and your family will treasure. A definite must if you liked movies such as a Sarah Plain and Tall, or Dances with Wolves. Buy it and Enjoy!!!
0316143472|1.0|I had high expectations going into this book based on all the hype. This book is, no question, the worst book I have ever read. I did not laugh once, not even a chuckle. This life situations this dude tackles are not funny. I had a big boil, my queen lances it, the fluid inside smells. Are you serious?? That's just gnarly, not humorous. Don't waste your time or money on this set of booooooring stories.
0316010669|1.0|Alright, I did start it, but I could not finish it. It was that boring. Don't make a snap judgment though, you should read it for yourself and realize that anyone without a brain can get published these days. A former boss who liked to drink and employ the services of hookers gave our team this as a Christmas gift which were some of the many Blink judgments he made.
B002VJ0576|1.0|When you elimate any positive attributes, all that is left no matter how awful must be this movie.    Cheap, illogical, totally out of character.The only thing lower than the production budget must have been the screenplay's budget.  This makes you yearn for Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century.
0307463745|5.0|I've pre-ordered the book and received it yesterday, March 08, just a day before it officially started selling. Initially I was going just to read few chapters, but ended up reading the whole book in under 2 hours. It doesn't contain any secret techniques, doesn't use fancy \\"business\\" terms, in fact it mocks most of these things, and does it pretty good. You can tell that authors do enjoy their work, and especially the flexibility of their business, that's why the book criticizes such things as boring meetings, complicated business plans etc. Even if you don't agree with everything they say, there's still that nice feeling when you realize that authors have built very successful business having these concepts in mind. Also, \\"Re-Work\\" has very small chapters, which I find a real advantage, as every time you turn the page, you read something new. Overall, my best recommendations.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Another great show from BBC. I could not wait to get it after watching the first \\"Cranford\\" - and I was not disappointed.

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|\\"Empire Ants\\" starts off like the nice-but-boring ballads from the last Blur album. Then it suddenly explodes into a dazzling rush of impossibly clean keyboards and [[ASIN:B002G1X2Z6 Yukimi Nagano]]'s lost, spaced-out vocals. It is an incredible, beautiful contrast with Damon Albarn's conventional balladeering in the beginning.    Ultimately, Plastic Beach isn't as visionary as [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 Demon Days]] (surely one of the top five albums of the 2000s), but when it does come together, there's nothing else like it. The album's other peak is the lead single \\"Stylo,\\" which unsurprisingly bears the most resemblance to the dark mood of Demon Days. It's packed with even more brilliant left-field juxtapositions than \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" The music is based on a cold pinpoint-techno crawl with dark keyboard overlays. The lead vocal is passed from a smooth vocoded rap by Mos Def, to Albarn's fragile lost soul (much like in \\"Feel Good Inc.\\"), to a colossal, histrionic turn by soul legend Bobby Womack. The smooth, easy way with which these three very different vocal styles alternate is remarkable, and the first two vocalists create a restrained counterpoint to Womack's overpowering, force-of-nature voice.    Alas, \\"Stylo\\" is the only time Plastic Beach flirts with darkness. The other catchy pop moments are of a more comic, whimsical nature. \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" has [[ASIN:B000000HHE De La Soul]] on lead vocals, but it's really a classicist British pop song masquerading as hip-hop. It has more in common with catchy, fey Blur songs like \\"[[ASIN:B000002USH For Tomorrow]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000000WA2 Charmless Man]]\\" (and with predecessors like the [[ASIN:B0001XLXDE Kinks]]) than with rap or electronic music. I predict that it will be massively popular in Britain, but I personally prefer the more dramatic tone of Demon Days.    Albarn produces the album himself this time, and it shows. Aside from the one brilliant moment in \\"Empire Ants,\\" there are no sudden, abrupt shifts like the crashing rap verse in \\"Dirty Harry\\" or the move from keyboards to acoustic guitar to strings in \\"Last Living Souls.\\" That was a large part of what made Demon Days so captivating -- you never knew what was coming next, even over the course of one song. Plastic Beach is less unpredictable.    Furthermore, Albarn's background in Britpop leads him to make less effective use of the rappers than previous producer Danger Mouse. On \\"White Flag,\\" Albarn tries to create an unconventional Gorillaz juxtaposition by putting a string and woodwind section together with rapping. Unfortunately, instead of flowing together seamlessly like \\"Dirty Harry,\\" it sounds really jarring. I think Kano and Bashy have an awkward flow, especially when compared to the effortless way in which Bootie Brown dominated a much more complex rhythm-and-strings combination on Demon Days. Additionally, \\"Sweepstakes\\" is a very ungainly and repetitive song (unfortunately much longer than \\"White Light\\") -- [[ASIN:B000067CLT Mos Def]] basically yells a few lines over and over, a far cry from his own performance in \\"Stylo.\\"    The huge number of collaborations on Plastic Beach means less than the sum of its parts. What's the point of getting [[ASIN:B00000189I Mark E. Smith]] on your album if you only have him sing a couple of lines? \\"Glitter Freeze\\" may have Smith's name on it, but it's basically an instrumental -- a good one, but you'd expect more. \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" has Gruff Rhys on the chorus, but he sounds completely identical to Albarn. The title track features Mick Jones and Paul Simonon of the [[ASIN:B00004BZ0N Clash]], but there's nothing about it that really stands out from any other Gorillaz song. If Jones is participating in the vocals, I couldn't tell him from Albarn either.    On the plus side, \\"Some Kind Of Nature\\" features a hugely appealing performance by Lou Reed. His bemused affectations, together with the music-hall backing, make him sound like a more gravelly-voiced version of Bowie. The positive tone is really infectious, and Albarn provides a bit of creeping melancholy in the chorus. Furthermore, Snoop Dogg is the perfect choice for \\"Welcome To The World Of The Plastic Beach.\\" His extremely lazy, luxuriant style is an ideal match for the tropical-resort image of the \\"plastic beach,\\" and he offers a generally positive message, but his voice always has this sleazy, threatening undercurrent that is also perfect for Albarn's vision of \\"plastic\\" debris. The glitzy, chintzy horns blaring throughout the track are a great touch, creating a seductively futuristic, extravagant sound.    Also, Albarn always has Britpop balladry to fall back on. He finds two gems in this vein: \\"Rhinestone Eyes,\\" where woozy synth-funk combines with his detached speak-singing (surprisingly poignant when it leans toward singing at the end of a line), and the gently rolling \\"On Melancholy Hill.\\" Other songs like \\"Broken\\" cover the same emotional territory, but \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" is by far the best.    I think we all wanted this to be the ultimate globe-trotting, ultra-hip, futuristic album. Actually, Plastic Beach is more like The Great Escape to Demon Days' [[ASIN:B000002TQB Parklife]]. It has more pop, more hooks, more collaborations, more everything, and sometimes it's even better, but still, it was Demon Days that really nailed the mood of the decade. Plastic Beach doesn't have the same effect, but it has moments of brilliant inspiration.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was waiting for something like this for years. I only regret that they broke up the Beatles 6 album.
0312330537|5.0|This novel, which ranges from Australia to India and the near east, is a fascinating, absorbing and gut-wrenching story.  One of the things that makes it so gripping is that much of it is true-- it is based on the author's personal experience in crime, prison and the criminal underworld.  The parts that take place in India are truly unique, because the author lived in a Indian slum for a time, as well as a rural village.  The combination of this experience and his first hand knowledge of the criminal underworld make for a fantastic read and terrific insight into the Indian spirit/character.  Not only could I not put Shantaram down, when I was not reading it I was often thinking about it.  This is a truly wonderful, gritty and unique story.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Another very monolithic movie from MM.  If you, like me, find humor in watching hypocrites in action you will love this movie.  MM has always been a master of deception-by-omission and this movie is no exception.  MM hates capitalism and if you purchase this movie you are supporting capitalism.  Would MM really want you to support capitalism by purchasing this movie?  I didn't think so either.

B00006878K|5.0|Put simply, if you don't have Born Under A Bad Sign, your blues--no--your music archive is incomplete.<br /><br />Backed by Booker T and the MGs, this album is the 12-bar blues of which King was one of the masters. It is in a big sense 100% blues, but with Kings covering cape vocals and the MGs back up, this also works as soul<br /><br />No accident this was first issued on Stax. GET IT.
B001KNUUTM|5.0|Goodness knows, there are a lot of highly regarded sets of The Well-Tempered Clavier to choose from; however, if you're looking for just one set my vote goes to this outstanding survey by Vladimir Feltsman. My points of reference for the WTC are Fischer and Richter, who take different approaches from each other and from Feltsman as well. Feltsman doesn't ruminate the way Richter often does, nor does he take off in manic spurts of speed the way Fisher sometimes does. Instead he focuses on structure while always finding the music in the notes. It's a joy to hear the pianist moving things forward, but never rushing, finding and expressing poetry and at the same time always mindful of the dance-like elements in the scores.<br /><br />The two books of the WTC add up to a lot of notes, and even though I rarely listen to more than one book of preludes at a sitting this can still lead to listener fatigue after a while, something that I was especially susceptible to when playing Richter's recording. This is never the case with Feltsman. (By the way, there are four hours and forty of minutes of music spread over four discs in this set. While most sets of the WTC are issued on four discs, Ashkenazy's recent set on Decca has been compressed onto three discs, which in my view is a negative for listeners who would prefer not to have the books split unevenly between discs.)<br /><br />Recorded in 1992 (Book 1) and 1995 (Book 2), and originally released by MusicMasters, this newly reissued set from Nimbus also benefits from high production standards. The set was produced and engineered by Max Wilcox, who produced nearly sixty of Artur Rubinstein's recordings for RCA, and it's no surprise that the musical results as well as the sound are superb.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B000000WCV|4.0|As a music fan and review, it is always healthy to bring yourself totally out of your element. I love rock prog blues and jazz. House is a genre I know next to nothing about.<br /><br />When I go to get my hair cut  and  stroll in to hear BOOM BOOM BOOM, I am not to crazy about the feeling. It feels to me music very young people dance, drink and have sex to. But when I heard this Daft Punk album was top of the line dance music, I got it.<br /><br />And like it. The beats are there, at  ranges a non-dance music fan is not used to. But hearing the synthesizer flourishes and the funky hooks here absolutely make this music to me. I am awed by the little needles of sound and rhythm shifts that pulsate through Daft Punk's music, which makes it to me an amazing musical experience.<br /><br />Probably this will not be a mainstay for me, but when I need a diversion, I know where to go.
B00337KM2S|2.0|I can't fathom why this had so much hype. There was certainly nothing special about it-just another updated Hudson/Day flick, except with \\"NEW! IMPROVED! SEX SCENES!\\"  Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga *BOTH* nominated for BSA? Really?? Schmooze away and you'll get a Nomination! I guess it really is about Academy politics. As Mo'Nique said, \\"I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics.\\" I was relieved when she won.  The performances here were not nomination-worthy, just average. Clooney was fine, again nothing special. Pair this with [[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]] (not as over-hyped but just as over-rated) and it's tedium at it's finest.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|The plot of Heat is not new. A smart thief and his crew are trying to pull a major heist and when a master cop gets wind, the film becomes about the chase.<br /><br />In Heat, watching this chase takes around three hours, but that is a plus. Michael Mann makes a spacious film, recalling 1970s crime drama. This movie is really not about the action--though it is contained here--but about the characters and what leads them to the action they find themselves in<br /><br />Both Al Picino, detective, and Robert De Niro, thief, are the best at their game. Since they are both brilliant--either could do the other's job--Heat becomes about the slow, meticulous creep to the final bank job. There is a long gunfight: explosive violence at its cinematic best, but this is hardly the point.<br />'<br />Heat features a thief who pulls his whole crew off a middle-of-the-night job when he hears a small bump no one else does--a careful pro for a careful film. He was right, too, and one guy leaning on a wall in a truck blows the whole stakeout. There is no margin for error and this cuts both ways.<br /><br />Heat also has a parolee who goes on the bank job after his new boss at a diner tells him 25% of his pay kicks back and he'll violate him if he does not cooperate.<br /><br />Small details, but in crime, life rises and falls on little details, and what keeps the idiots in jail and the pros out are the choices made in such situations. Mann shows this all with incredible economy--it is at times like those three stroke oriental paintings that say everything by leaving more out than they include.<br /><br />So you get drawn in just watching both cops and crooks work and live and how this impacts their lives. You are so captivated by the intelligence, anything they do makes you look harder. The length becomes essential.<br /><br />Great film for snowy days.

0312382464|4.0|This is the second book in Penman's Welsh trilogy and covers the life of Simon de Montfort, a man who really was ahead of his time when it comes to government, thus causing him to be completely at odds with most of the nobility of his age. He helped bring about the start of Parliament in England which was not looked on favorably by Henry III (what monarch would want to give up some of his power?). Penman's exceptional writing once again shines brightly.<br /><br />Simon de Montfort was born a Frenchman and managed to \\"talk his way\\" into a relative's English earldom. He then ended up marrying the English king's sister, Nell, sowing the seeds of dislike in the monarch. Simon becomes completely fed up with Henry's inability to rule his kingdom and tries to create a more democratic government, trying to institute such things as Parliament, to help the monarch. He suffers through several periods of exile in France for his efforts, though going to help his monarch in times of military need which gets him back in England each time. Eventually, dispite Simon's good intentions, Henry sees him as a traitor which leads to a rebellion. This book is full of very volatile characters with very big personalities, all very well described and their growth and change throughout very well documented. I was really amazed at how completely inept Henry was as a king and wondered how he managed to keep his throne. I could fully sympathize with Simon in his annoyance with his monarch's complete lack of backbone, though I could see where he could have gone about things differently, thus not angering Henry quite as much (basically calling your king an inbecile is not going to sit well). Simon really is a very human \\"hero\\" in this novel - he is championing a very noble cause and is a good, decent, and honorable man but he is also has quite a few flaws. I really feel it is his flaws that really made me cheer for him; he was so REAL. Henry's son, the future Edward I, made himself highly dislikable in my eyes with his constant betrayals and going back on his word. With as often as he stabbed people in the back it is hard to see how any man would trust him once he became king. I can see why he was such a powerful king (people probably feared him) but I will never look on him in the same light again. Interspersed with Simon and Henry's story is the continuing Welsh story - this time focusing on Llewelyn Fawr's grandson, Llewelyn, and his struggles against his brothers Owain and Davydd as he fights to keep alive his grandfather's wonderful dream of a strong and united Wales. He has to deal with the same issues his grandfather did - Welsh lords that are greedy and don't want to see the ancient ways changed (even if they would really help) and relatives all too eager to betray him. His is not the main story here though it is interwoven with Simon's throughout.<br /><br />I enjoyed this second book though not nearly as much as the first in the trilogy (but really, how can you NOT immensely enjoy reading about Llewelyn Fawr and Joanna?). I felt a bit bogged down in the middle with all the discussion about the Provisions and such. At times it was confusing to keep up with who was allied with which side and who betrayed whom (and there was quite a bit of this going on). However things really picked up towards the end as events snowballed to the climax. I felt that the descriptions and details of the various main players in this novel really set it apart from others - they are so wonderfully described that it feels as if I knew them personally. I can not wait to read the last book in the series, \\"The Reckoning\\", which truly focuses on Llewelyn and his final struggles in Wales.eyes with his constant betrayals and going back on his word.

0307271862|5.0|...due to a terrible review in The Economist.  Having read the book now, I think the Economist reviewer allowed some of Mankell's positive comments about Robert Mugabe and the effects of British colonial policy in Africa to influence their view of the whole book<br /><br />That was a mistake.  This is one of Mankell's better books.  It echoes his debut novel in the Kurt Wallander series, Faceless Killers, one of his best books.  As with Faceless Killers, the book opens with the discovery of a gruesome massacre in remote Swedish farm country.  Unlike Faceless Killers, the eventual solution in The Man from Beijing comes not from dogged police work, but skillful digging by a judge from southern Sweden who is related distantly with one of the murdered families.<br /><br />For those of you who know Mankell, the fact that he splits his own time between Sweden and Mozambique is well known.  You may also know that the Chinese have made expansion into Africa a high priority.  Clearly this has been on his mind as the book involves a fictional effort by the Chinese government to resettle millions of poor peasants from Western China into a fertile valley in eastern Africa.  The book spans the globe with action in Sweden, China, Africa, England, and the western United States.  It spans from 1866 to 2006 in time.  And it concerns itself with two different waves of Chinese immigration, both forced.<br /><br />Mankell has never made more skillful use of parallel stories to compare and contrast what is going on in our time with what has happened in the past.  There are  many ironic counterpoints he wants to make about the wave of Chinese labor brought into the United States to drive the intercontinental railroad and how it would compare with the fictional immigration wave of Chinese peasants about to go to Africa.  He has dealt with the subject of immigration many times (Faceless Killers, The Dogs of Riga).  What he hasn't done before is think about immigration from one part of the developing world to another.  And he has not written before about the stresses and strains of a society developing from a feudal economy to a fully industrialized economy as China is during our times.<br /><br />Readers wanting just another Swedish police procedural will not find this work attractive.  Readers wanting to see a truly talented writers explore new ground and pose many thoughtful questions to the reader will delight in this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.her.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I've been a movie fan all my life. AVATAR is definitely the best movie I've ever seen. Great story, great cinematogphraphy, fantastic visual presentations, extremely creative, and an absolute wonder in IMAX 3D. Okay, it didn't get much at the OSCARS, but when you consider the last two winners, Hurt Locker and Slumdog Millionaire....well, do the OSCARS really mean anything anymore? This movie is all about entertainment...pleasing the viewers...making the viewers feel good! In my opinion, that's what movies are supposed to be about. No really big names other than Sigourney Weaver. But since the actors have been altered, are big names really necessary? A fun movie for the entire family...to watch more than once.

B002S0OBMS|4.0|Judging from this cast recording, Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Love Never Dies\\" is a solid sequel to the composer's blockbuster, \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\"      The show is a risky proposition that could have been a disaster, and indeed the critics have not weighed in as of this writing, but whatever the fate of \\"Love Never Dies,\\" I don't think anyone can accuse the composer of simply trying to cash in on his biggest success.  This is an effective score in Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom\\"-\\"Woman in White\\"- gothic melodrama mode-- a genre in which he obviously excels. The lush melodies are here, as they always are, but what really impressed me is that the plot (book by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton, and Glenn Slater; lyrics by Slater) is surprisingly well constructed, with sharper characterizations of the main players from \\"Phantom\\"--The Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg (The only major addition is Christine's and Raoul's son Gustave.).     The action takes place ten years after \\"Phantom\\" on Coney Island, which turns out to be an inspired choice of setting, allowing the composer to have fun with the amusement park atmosphere (lots of varied and swirling, often thrilling, melodies) while also giving us a logical place for the Phantom to have settled-- among the other freaks in this funhouse world.  Madame and Meg Giry have managed to help the Phantom escape Paris and the three have settled in America (Meg has been singing cheesy vaudeville songs at the resort.). Eventually, Christine arrives with Raoul and their son for a performance. Raoul has turned into a bit of a drunk and a gambler (Christine takes the gig to help settle his debts). Of course, the Phantom, still pining for her, has arranged Christine's concert in secret.     The plot develops at a steady, if somewhat slow, pace and I cannot really imagine a better follow-up for these characters. They were not particularly well developed in the original (as Lloyd Webber has stated), so this is a worthy attemptto add more purpose to the characters. The music is memorable, and does not simply rehash the earlier show. There are little moments of the \\"Phantom\\" score well placed in certain spots, but these are very few. The music manages to recall its predecessor by matching its tone and style, without merely copying it. (Careful listeners will notice that part of \\"Our Kind of Love\\" from \\"The Beautiful Game\\" is used in the title tune here. Lloyd Webber has acknowledged this and stated that he always intended to use it in a Phantom sequel, and was unhappy with it in \\"Beautiful Game,\\" and has since replaced it. Good enough for me.)    My one major complaint about the recording is the casting. Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Sierra Boggess as Christine, are fine singers, but they are not distinctive in the way Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were on the original. The cast feels a little too ordinary, and the acting can come across a bit stilted. I hope they show a bit more personality on stage.     Like most Lloyd Webber recordings, this is a nearly complete recording, with well over two hours of music. I think other \\"Phantom\\" fans will be pleased.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Well for starters being on a space ship millions of miles from Earth, with no control over this ship and being hunted down by ravenous mutants who want to eat your flesh.  And thats just the first half of the movie.  Now add in the possibility that you and another survivor could be going through the beginning stages of a mental disorder (the films title) that may cause you to become paranoid and dangerous.  With no where to run and the ship's core about to shut down for good its up to Bower (Ben Foster) to try and remember what has happened and how to fix the reactor.  The movie had some cheap thrills but the mae-up and sets were outstanding and Ben Foster has never disappointed me with a performance and his record remains flawless.  The movie is definately worth a watch if Sci-Fi and Horror are your thing.
B002S0OBN2|4.0|Judging from this cast recording, Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Love Never Dies\\" is a solid sequel to the composer's blockbuster, \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\"     The show is a risky proposition that could have been a disaster, and indeed the critics have not weighed in as of this writing, but whatever the fate of \\"Love Never Dies,\\" I don't think anyone can accuse the composer of simply trying to cash in on his biggest success. This is an effective score in Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom\\"-\\"Woman in White\\"- gothic melodrama mode-- a genre in which he obviously excels. The lush melodies are here, as they always are, but what really impressed me is that the plot (book by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton, and Glenn Slater; lyrics by Slater) is surprisingly well constructed, with sharper characterizations of the main players from \\"Phantom\\"--The Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg (The only major addition is Christine's and Raoul's son Gustave.).     The action takes place ten years after \\"Phantom\\" on Coney Island, which turns out to be an inspired choice of setting, allowing the composer to have fun with the amusement park atmosphere (lots of varied and swirling, often thrilling, melodies) while also giving us a logical place for the Phantom to have settled-- among the other freaks in this funhouse world. Madame and Meg Giry have managed to help the Phantom escape Paris and the three have settled in America (Meg has been singing cheesy vaudeville songs at the resort.). Eventually, Christine arrives with Raoul and their son for a performance. Raoul has turned into a bit of a drunk and a gambler (Christine takes the gig to help settle his debts). Of course, the Phantom, still pining for her, has arranged Christine's concert in secret.     The plot develops at a steady, if somewhat slow, pace and I cannot really imagine a better follow-up for these characters. They were not particularly well developed in the original (as Lloyd Webber has stated), so this is a worthy attempt to add more purpose to the characters. The music is memorable, and does not simply rehash the earlier show. There are little moments of the \\"Phantom\\" score well placed in certain spots, but these are very few. The music manages to recall its predecessor by matching its tone and style, without merely copying it. (Careful listeners will notice that part of \\"Our Kind of Love\\" from \\"The Beautiful Game\\" is used in the title tune here. Lloyd Webber has acknowledged this and stated that he always intended to use it in a Phantom sequel, and was unhappy with it in \\"Beautiful Game,\\" and has since replaced it. Good enough for me.)     My one major complaint about the recording is the casting. Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Sierra Boggess as Christine, are fine singers, but they are not distinctive in the way Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were on the original. The cast feels a little too ordinary, and the acting can come across a bit stilted. I hope they show a bit more personality on stage.     Like most Lloyd Webber recordings, this is a nearly complete recording, with well over two hours of music. I think other \\"Phantom\\" fans will be pleased.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|This video is a great history of The Who. I learned a lot and enjoyed the cool music!
B002L1GQ5O|5.0|I lost a lot of music recently with a total computer failure.  How appropriate then that this album go on sale.  I hadn't listened to it in a while, and it really stands the test of time.
B000WQWPJQ|1.0|Yeah, the box says \\"Blu-Ray\\" and it's in a Blu-Ray jewel case but it is not a blu-ray DVD. It is an AVC DVD. Why the manufacturers/studio chose to cheat the public with a blu-ray movie price is senseless. Great movie but a terrible product.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you have seen the play, you will love  the soundtrack.  It makes you feel just   like you were still watching the play!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I think a basic understanding of the culture is required to appreciate this work. I guess people who gave poor reviews only enjoy there little U.S.A and never sees the rest of the world.
B0035P0OTE|3.0|To state the obvious this is a rock-heavy album.  If you don't like distorted guitars then just stay away from this album...Simple enough.  If you listen to rock regularly or sparingly I think this album is worth a couple of listens.  Overall the album lacks flow and a uniform sound, but there are a few gems to be found.  My favorite tracks include the following:    \\"Prom Queen\\" - When I first heard that Wayne was doing a rock album this is what I imagined it would sound like.  Shanell is the showcase of this track.  \\"On Fire\\" - Classic club hit.   \\"Drop the World\\" - Eminem really stole the show on this track.  This is the most Rap/HipHop track on the whole album.    \\"Runnin'\\" - I'm a big fan of Flyleaf and bands that sound like them.  Shanell's vocals on this track is reminiscent of a Flyleaf track.   \\"One Way Trip\\" - This track showcases Travis Parker's drumming along with Kevin Rudolf's clean/classic rock vocals.   \\"The Price Is Wrong\\" - I just like this one because Lil' Wayne's vocal delivery reminds me of something from a Bad Brains track (most people hate it though).     Definitely approach this album with an open mind and you may find something you like.  Fortunately you can just buy the tracks you like, because there are definitely some songs worth skipping :)  Overall this is a C+ album.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I remember when this movie came out, there was a lot of bashing it in the media, with many critics and commentators saying it was a sappy movie made for teenage girls. I almost fell for this and didn't go to see it until it was almost gone from theaters. It was a fantastic movie, in fact, one of the best movies I've ever seen. I just watched it again recently and was once again amazed by this movie. James Cameron is a genius.
1904104053|4.0|I am very happy with this grahpic novel version of my favorite play. The full text of The Tempest is illustrated. Readers unfamiliar with Shakespeare will want to have an annotated edition handy as a supplement to this version, since there are no glosses provided. I would have given it five stars, if it weren't for one or two misprints in the text, and one or two very odd interpretive moments -example of the latter: a character addresses a speech to, while facing away from, and seemingly unaware of, the addressee.<br /><br />I like Oscar Grillo's artwork a lot; it's expressive and distinctive, maybe unique; but it is odd enough that I would urge you to examine the larger image of the front cover before deciding to buy. It is a representative example of Grillo's style. I can certainly imagine it will not be to everyone's taste.
1416585710|1.0|I had read 400 pages of this book, and said to myself \\"I still have 250 pages to go?!?!\\" I was amazed how angry this book made me, because it was such lazy writing. King falls back on the there's \\"something evil\\" out there routine, and instead of building dread, it just annoys you. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, especially Lisey herself, who was flat and uninteresting. Her life was defined by being Scott's husband, not anything of her own. The book was tedious, and King's usual dialogue flourishes to add small observations about life and the world just came off as cutesy for cutesy's sake here. I won't even get into the made up language that so many other reviewers have already derided. I put this book down for weeks and even months at a time, because I really didn't care what happened. I forced myself to finish it so I could write an informed review of how much I hated it, but it was a struggle since the ending was so rotten. If you want a dead spouse story by King read \\"Bag Of Bones\\" instead.    I've been reading Stephen King for nearly 30 years, but I think I'm going to be taking an extended break to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Not just a terrible King novel, a terrible book in general. Don't be surprised by the number of one star reviews - it's that bad. Just awful.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|I liked this movie about as much as his last film, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". The special effects were great, and the ending hat a bit of a twist. I did like the Alternate ending better then the one they chose.    If you can suspend disbelief a bit, then you will enjoy this movie. If you are one of those people who nit-picks every thing about Sci-Fi movies then you probably won't.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|The stories are really cool! Looks aswome in High-Def!    Great description of the Halo Universe.
B0008JFMEC|5.0|Crazy awesome movie. The action was great. Music well thought out for scenes and was the type of movie where i was pulled in right away.  But just keep in mind there is a Vol 2.
0393316041|5.0|I've read the book within a week! The book is well written! I recomend the book as a must book for everyone!
B002FRNCG0|4.0|Got this cd thinking it had the song that is actually only on the TWILIGHT cd...but found that the cd is pretty good. really liked the \\"new best friend\\" song.
B0026P3G12|5.0|We loved this CD.  The quality of the sound is excellent. The selection of the songs is very nice and Susan Boyle is a great singer.  This is much better than I expected. Good job.
B0030BYWKU|4.0|Must say this cd has some really good dancing songs. I have been listening to # 3 on the cd over and over. Can't get enough.
B000068R1X|3.0|`Bark at the Moon' was made during a trying time in Ozzy's career and the overall quality shows. The loss of Randy Rhoads was initially much to overcome though Ozzy gained a new partner in Jake E. Lee. However theirs was to be tumultuous and ultimately unfulfilling. Bob Daisley rejoined the band and again contributed to the songwriting (though uncredited initially) and `Bark at the Moon' looked to recapture the momentum of the first two records. The title track and \\"Rock and Rebel\\" would continue the quality of earlier recordings but there is a lot of filler on this record. It is not one I play with any regularity and I don't see it being much better than the follow up `Ultimate Sin\\". \\"So Tired\\" is a nice ballad and \\"Slow Down\\" and `Centre of Eternity\\" are decent rockers but I just feel like Ozzy hadn't quite fought off his demons enough to reassert some real quality control to the proceedings. His legendary tour with Motley Crue didn't help matters much as his substance abuse issues skyrocketed out of control. Still `Bark at the Moon' is a quality recording that although it hasn't aged as well as the Randy records is still an essential LP from this man's `80's heyday.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|THe lyrics make you think \\"odd but okay\\" but you can't deny the beats are rockin hard.  I couldn't stop myself from jammin to this cd. Love the phone song. Really every song had me going.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|As a teen growing up in the sixties, the first album that I purchased was Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears\\".  I was totally taken back by the sound that came  from Eric Clapton's guitar.  He may not have been as flambouyant a player as  Hendrix, but his sound would live for the ages.  I never thought that anyone  else in my lifetime would even come close to sounding as good as Clapton, but  now comes Joe Bonamassa.  Meet the new boss, better than the old boss!  I  never would have thought that I would make that comment ever in my life, but  I just did!    Bigneib
B001BPB5WK|3.0|this was a very cute movie but was lacking the loving feeling.  Not saying they needed to get naughty but a little more passion could have helped. Great songs though sung by band in movie.
B00275EGWY|4.0|I like this movie a lot. The directing and acting are great. Nevertheless, I agree with many veterans that many scenes in the movie were simply too far from reality. How could a team of three had to do a duel in the desert with the terrorists for, hours? I couldnt apprehend how it won the Oscars. Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down are much better. In short, highly watchable but didnt deserve that many little Gold Man it got.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Absolutely magnificient! One of the best musicals ever, even if you're not a fan musicals. Heartfelt story that really is for all ages.
B0035V35P8|4.0|I had been surprised in a very positive way by this movie which led me to watch past \\"The End\\" and found the names of Joel Silver and the Wachowski Brothers (those who made \\"The Matrix\\"), that I had regained part of my confidence lost in them for \\"Speed Racer\\". The story is standard but fast, period. The choreography and action are great yet bloody. One may not like the face of the main actor \\"Rain\\". However, his body is very convincing although the ending is a little bit overdone. Definitely a very good choice of rental after a hard day's work. Recommended.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|I watched this movie during the weekend and did not expect it the way it is.  The interaction of the frog stories is very cute and the whole idea of a princess having to kiss a frog to make him human again.  However,  this story is about Voodoo magic and it is something a lot of kids will not understand and are going to become frightened when they see several images as the movie goes along.  Besides the scary images (which also include showing the bad guy walking around and a completely different image of its shadow against the walls) there is also references to Satan as the Shadow Man mentions during several occasions his 'master' (or something like that).    I would not buy this movie to any kid.  I strongly recommend an adult to watch it first before showing it to a kid. I do not think Disney should have gone to the extremes with the Voodoo and black magic stuff.
B001HN694K|2.0|Director Tim Burton doesn't really bother to adapt \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (he and screenwriter Linda Woolverton throw Lewis Carroll's original \\"Alice\\" books completely away) as much as he creates \\"Alice In  Tim Burtonland.\\" As such, the film does not disappoint. . At worst, Lewis Carroll's enigmatic Wonderland is transformed into a standard \\"fantasy cinema\\" (extremely CGI) landscape where a standard battle between Good and Evil must be fought and won. At best, Tim Burton gives you a typical \\"Tim Burton film\\" with his trademark touches; such as his creative muse Johnny Depp as a deathly pale, demented,  Bozo the Clown-looking Mad Hatter; and his wife Helena Bonham Carter perfectly cast as the tyrannical Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is spacey, saintly and \\"blissed out\\" as  the White Queen. As an almost adult Alice, Mia Wasikowski looks bored and baffled throughout.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This was my first blu-ray purchase and I couldn't be happier. I absolutely loved this movie. It grabs you from the opening scene and holds you until the end. The opening sequence is incredible! The special effects, the acting and best of all, the music. The escape scene from the Kelvin into the Star Trek intro still gives me chills when I watch it. A great movie.
B002UD56I6|5.0|NOW at least you have a High Definition Blu-Ray version of this extraordinary entertainer that is no longer with us. The amount of  attention Michael devotes to detail, color, moves, music, dance, story telling plus the bonus that this whole production was an out growth of his wanting to leave a legacy to his 3 children on his tour capabilities, will leave you absolutely breathless. He was indeed a ONE of a kind legend in his own time. There's lots of bonus materials on the life, hits, music videos and achievements of Michael Jackson including those that were not a part of the original 2009 movie theater performance on the BD format. Also last but not least, the 5.1 surround sound will give your entertainment center a real workout and then some.
0385751893|1.0|Bruno is a nine-year-old boy living in Berlin who is happy going to school and playing with his friends. When his father gets a new job, their family has to move to a place called 'Out-With', a cold and desolate place in the country, where Bruno and his sister Gretel have to be tutored at home. Ignoring warnings to remain close to the house, Bruno explores the edges of the huge wired-off camp next to their house and meets a boy named Shmuel who lives on the other side of the fence, with whom he becomes friends.<br /><br />The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is an un-researched, wholly unbelievable and rather insulting novel. John Boyne writes his book in an extremely earnest tone, using the horrors and misery of the Holocaust to...I'm not sure what actually. The book is extremely short (210 pages of extremely large type and unusually narrow margins) and appears to be completely bereft of any kind of point. Bruno moves next to Auschwitz (but doesn't know what it is), moans about leaving his friends behind, meets a Jewish boy and they swap some illuminating stories (except they aren't) and there's a few knowing moments when adult readers can work out some nasty things are going on off-page and then it ends on a note so contrived and unbelievable it is borderline comedic.<br /><br />The book is based around a series of lies. A nine-year-old boy growing up in Berlin in 1943 would be close to the age for entering the Hitler Youth (by this stage compulsory) and would have been educated at school about the 'evils' of Judaism. The notion that a nine-year-old boy in Nazi Germany wouldn't know what a Jew was or that there was even a war on is completely farcical. His twelve-year-old sister definitely would, as she would be a member of the League of German Girls (the female equivalent of the Hitler Youth) and by this point would be pretty heavily indoctrinated in National Socialism. The idea that the daughter of a senior military official and someone personally earmarked for greatness by Hitler himself (who has dinner at the family house at one point in the book) would evade this compulsory service is also inconceivable. The notion that a prisoner of Auschwitz would be able to spend hours on end, day after day, talking to someone through a fence without a single guard or other prisoner noticing is also fundamentally unbelievable.<br /><br />The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (*) is a book that the author conceived of and wrote apparently in a deliberate effort to be worthy and artistic, but then did no research for the book (apparently written over a single weekend; it shows, badly) at all, making elementary errors that even the most casual student of WWII, Nazi and Jewish history will pick up on immediately. This is that most pitiful of books, a contrived narrative that makes an attempt to deliberately tug at the heartstrings by employing a real-life horror to make up for the writer's lack of ability. Definitely one to be avoided.mself (who has dinner at the family house at one point in the book) would evade this compulsory service is also inconceivable.

B00288KNL8|4.0|What an absolutely incredible movie. The animation is superb, the story is very intriguing (though I found the last 30 minutes to be a little bit disappointing), and it has enough edge to it to keep the cooler kids interested. I wish it was about 10 minutes shorter, but that is a small complaint.     Some people will have issue with the darker aspects of it and with the scantilly clad \\"Moulin Rogue\\" act performed by the eccentric neighbors, but it's completely harmless fun for the non-prudish crowd. My four year old girl LOVES this movie, and I think the character of Coraline (a strong, confidant , smart, and independent young girl who isn't a brat but isn't annoyingly perfect either) is wonderful.    The 2D version looks SOOOO much better than the 3D, and is so crystal clear that I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch the 3D version, with it's blurry effects and awful color distortion.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|I bought this for my hubby cause he is a big fan. He loved it. He said it was one of his favorite gifts EVER.  hahaha.  He keeps it in the box for full bowling affect. Brings 2 DVDs.  One is the movie and the other is of extras and interviews.  No different from other extras. What makes this special is the packaging. It looks AWESOME!
0896898288|2.0|Such a shame that a book about such a beautiful quilt has NO instructions or no measurements for making its blocks.  Today's quilters use rotary rulers and cutters for cutting strips, squares, and triangles to precise measurements for making quilt blocks.  I can't understand why she authored a quilt book that does not give instructions and measurements, rather than having everyone who attempts to make this quilt to go through each block to calculate every measurement and angle.    I am a member of a group who began working on Farmer's Wife blocks at the start of the year, and we are all disappointed in the author's unconventional \\"instructions\\" for making quilt blocks. She does not seem to be in tune with conventional quilting methods and techniques.  Mrs. Hird, your book should have been advertised as a project for hand piecing!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is my favorite film of the year.  And beyond.  I laughed a lot!  And I did cry.  I watched this movie with my pre-teen niece and nephew, my forty something sister, my thirty something girlfriend and I'm buying it for my grandmother's birthday.  It has something special for everyone.
0765350386|1.0|Not sure what exactly other readers liked about this book. In fact, I read it to the end just because of the high comments it got. Otherwise, it would have been the first fantasy book I left unfinished in a while.<br /><br />It's pretty bad - the plot is absurd and ridiculous, the main character, again a 17 year old kick-ass girl who is repeatedly allowed to do whatever she likes without any substantial consequences in a world where the rest pay dearly for their actions.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are simply not there - the usual grown-up people who in fact have no idea what's exactly going on.<br /><br />It gets better, the world is original and I was attracted to it, but it didn't overcome the shallowness of the action and the plot.
B000TEPF7K|5.0|This album is key.  KEY.  Seriously though, it's my favorite Eno album, unique among his own stuff (he called this one \\"funk\\") and unique among everything.<br /><br />Funk though... (thinking of one of the bass lines) okay, funk on a series of very lonely planets \\"drifting at the edge of time\\" with spiders for company, where that bass player drifts into a wild atonal solo only to be quickly called back to underpin the cowbell interlude.<br /><br />This is the one with the ad for prints of Peter Schmidt paintings and Oblique Strategies card decks.<br /><br />This is the one where all the titles are supposed to be anagrams (at least \\"King's Lead Hat\\" is) of Eno-related people and things.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I ordered this book on my iphone so I was able to read the book wherever I was. The story was very intense from the beginning.  I could not put it down.  I followed the dates and locations that the author used and researched the information myself.  I cannot imagine the pain and suffering that the characters in the story had gone through.  My heart goes out to the little boy that was left behind.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|The speedy services is greatly appreciated. I am enjoying this series very much can't wait for season three.  Hope its will be as intense as the firts two seasons.
B003A9OVS0|4.0|In many ways this album feels more designed than composed as if a modern architect with a flare for music came into the studio and decided to apply his intuitions of his first trade onto music. Whether it's the crisp sounds of Stylo or the more offbeat rhythm of Superfast Jellyfish, you will be surprised by this true departure the typical as found in this album. If you are coming to buy it with the expectation of the same old as before, then you will be disappointed and maybe a little surprised.

If you're a fan of Hendrix or blues influenced rock music, this is a must have.

If somebody cherrypicks the right stories and selected researchs, it's possible demonstrate anything.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell had an idea and has started to search everywhere for elements to strenghten his idea, fighting against the real and multifaceted world, that bravely tries to resist to that oversimplification.<br /><br />According to Malcolm, successful people generally have strived hard.

It doesn't help to prove the author's hype.<br /><br />At least I've laughed high: Malcolms argues that Beatles's success is basically because they have sweated in Hamburg.<br /><br />Seriously, I believe that the success is a very complex question to be answered by an only book.<br /><br />One book that shows part of this question is Leonard Mlodinow's \\"The Drunkard's Walk\\" that shows the randomness's influence in our world and in the people's fate<br /><br />My belief is that there is no single recipe.<br /><br />Success is work, talent, oportunities and cultural influences, but the proportions are not fixed.

B00275EGWY|3.0|Hurt Locker isn't a bad film in itself and the story of the main character is interesting, as is the menace of the bombs and the faceless duel that seems to ensue. I think that part of the film is clever.    The sets are fantastic and have a realistic gritty feel. Now I have not been to Iraq/Afghanistan myself but in my circle of friends there are two that have been there for tour of duty and keeping this in mind I don't think he story is far fetched as some here say. Things do and will happen in war.    The thing just is that Hurt Locker is simply o.k. and nothing more. It is certainly no Oscar material (nor would Avatar or District 9 rank anywhere close) and stands badly to comparison to the far better war movies out there like Black Hawk Down or Apocalypse Now. In fact there is a scene, reasonably long showing how our main character in Hurt Locker cannot cope with normal life at home. In Apocalypse Now Martin Sheen lies on his back in a sweaty bed and thinks out loud \\"When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said \\"yes\\" to a divorce. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.\\" and it had a greater impact.    Recommended viewing for those that enjoy gritty war films but don't expect too much from it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is an incredible movie.  A wheelchair user as hero, peaceable primitive people (as the good guys), unbelieveable pictures and a sensationally soundtrack.     Avatar is one of the best movies in the century. Only the Academy Award (maybe of envy) members think different and gave Avatar not the Oscars it deserves.

B00275EGWY|5.0|\\"The Hurt Locker\\" has just won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture and it truly earns it. Here is a war movie that takes no real position on war, and especially no position on the Iraq War, and simply shows the mental and physical brutality and beauty of conflict.    You know the story by now. It centers around a bomb disposal and disarmament team in Iraq who throw themselves into harm's way on a regular basis in order to make life safer for their fellow soldiers and civilians. The team receives a new member, played by the fantastic Jeremy Renner, who is something of a wild card. Soon he and everyone else are pulled into his own personal brand of insanity as he comes to realize that without the war, he's nothing.    It's a simple concept and wonderfully executed by Kathryn Bigelow and her team. It was filmed on location in the Middle East and you really get a sense of what life is like that part of the world for our soldiers and the civilians who live there. You bear witness to some of the day-to-day tragedies that happen (admittedly not as much now as they did in 2004 when this movie is apparently set), like a man forced into a suicide bombing. It's a harrowing look at an unpleasant reality.    I mention in the title of the review that it's an action movie where you dread the action. This is entirely true. You really start to become quite fond of the three bomb techs, and when the bullets start flying and things start exploding, you worry about them. You want nothing more than for them to go back to their base, nice and safe, and not venture out into the dangerous world. It's something I've not come across in an action-type film, and I'm glad to see it here.    Was this actually the best movie of 2009? Well, yes. It won't have the long-term influence of \\"Avatar\\", but it is overall better than that film. I'm glad it won and I'm glad I've seen it.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|After reading the first three books one right after the other, I couldn't wait to get to the \\"end\\".  Well, there is no end.  So if you prefer a finite plot line, with some tonal variation, quit while you're ahead.  Instead of bringing loose ends together, Martin has just created more of them.  New locales, new characters; why not just write a new series, and give us some satisfaction by creating an ending for this one?
B00328G4V6|4.0|To save time and shipping I went down to Target to pick this up as it is the same price. To my surprise, the Target release has an additional 2 songs that aren't listed here. They're shown as bonus tracks which gives the CD 14 songs instead of the 12 on this release.<br /><br />As far as a review; I'm at work so haven't had time to listen to it but just jumping tracks for a few minutes showed potential. This system requires a rating so I arbituarily gave it 4 stars for now.<br /><br />I really just wanted to get this message out so everyone would know that this release is available.<br /><br />Edit: I just realized that this was mentioned in a previous review. I apologize for the redundancy.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Classic 80's horror/comedy movie. Set in a non-specific small suburban town. Aliens that look like evil clowns set down and begin terrorizing the town's people, capturing some while killing others. A funny movie with at least decent special effects for the time period. Worth watching for someone who enjoys movies from the 80's, especially for someone who has seen it before.

B0034JKZ86|3.0|As animation, fantasy this was a good movie.  As themes go, I must say that this movie smells.  Typical racist attitude, that Disney has exibited forever.  An up and coming young Black Princess, unable to find that ideal man to make her life complete, circumstances lead her to...<br /><br />A great deal has been written about the fact this is an interracial situation.  As usual it is the White guy with the woman of color.  As if it does not occur in the other direction.  Oh yes that continues to be taboo in 21st century America.  Like many of the early Westerns, the White guy gets the beautiful Indian Princess, the Asian beauty, or the beautiful Mexican dancer.  We only want your women.<br /><br />Why an exploration of interracial dating with this film aimed at mainly young Black impressionable girls, and in this manner.  Why not both ways to tell our young people there is nothing wrong with a Black man having a wife that is White, or even a White man with a Black wife.  Or maybe that is the point.  It is ok for the White man to marry outside the norm, but not the White woman?  Or worse yet the Black man is persona non grata.  This is a theme I have observed a great deal in Hollyweird, Hollywood, of late, since \\"The Body Guard.\\"<br /><br />In a great many movies of late we will see one Black woman, and she just happens to be the love interest of a White guy, and hang out with only White guys.  Not one Black male in the entire movie.  Disney has even placed this theme in some of it's for children weekly animation series.  Then there is Nickelodeion's \\"True Jackson,\\" and ABC Family's \\"Lincoln Heights.\\"  All aimed at young people containing the same theme.  Why?<br /><br />Please Hollywood, wake up realize that this thing called interracial dating, and marriage happens both ways, and being racist about the theme is a horrible way to show our young people how life happens to be.  Sad that we cannot get past these sterotypes, built into our outlook so long ago, and this animated movie does nothing to empower society to look past color.<br /><br />Do I wish this movie had been all Black, maybe.  Just why was not \\"Prince Charming,\\" Black?  Should Snow White have had people of color included, or Sleeping Beauty, of course.  But when the first movie for Black children comes to being, why must it have this theme? I wonder how many behind the scenes people with a little power were Black?  I do not know, but I dare say none.  Thus the insensitivity of this presentation.  So what if a bunch of...empower society to look past color.    Do I wish this movie had been all Black, maybe.  Just why was not \\"Prince Charming,\\" Black?  Should Snow White have had people of color included, or Sleeping Beauty, of course.

B000C13Y2S|2.0|The flashlight is very cute, but when I tried to put it on all I got was a very very faint light. Turns out 2 out of the 3 batteries exploded and that's why the light wont work. Now, not only have I paid 6 dollars for this flashlight, I have to go to the store and buy new batteries. This is why I rated it so badly, I mean if you pay for something to come with batteries and ready to work it should be so.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|I saw Departures at the City of Tacoma, Washington's  annual Sister Cities International Film Festival as the entry from Kitakyushu, Japan.  I was not aware that Departures had been awarded the Oscar for the best foreign language film in 2009.  To say the film was stunningly beautiful is an understatement.  Director Yohiro Takita's comments explain how the film's beauty was thoughtfully played out.  Takita expressed that he was surprised that the film got such wide approval outside of Japan.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This \\"disaster\\" movie was a complete disaster. Where to begin?    (Spoilers) The beginning is confusing. But it isn't until the actual destruction began... Then I really started to hate this movie. John Cusack and his family narrowly escape the destruction about 6 times or more in this horrendous pile of garbage. Every single time, it is right on their heels. And the parts where he jumps the limo, and then later jumps the RV. It was embarassing. And then the parts that attempt humor- I just wanted to throw a brick through my TV screen. What could they have possibly been thinking? Talk about a movie that had incredible potential. But instead we just got an almost 3-hour steaming pile of dog crap.    I hate this movie.
B00111YM5G|5.0|I heard about this movie in a round about way. I thought Prophecy was the best angel movie I ever saw. Move over Prophecy because Gabriel is an AWESOME movie. Made in Australia, by an independent film director on a rubberband budget. This movie is incredible. It's dark and it showed a depth to the archangels never before seen. It shows the length these celestial beings will go to protect the human race. The tone of the movie is heart felt as Gabriel seeks out his brethren under a cloak of darkness that has envelope the planet. To see that one of the angels cut off her wings and turned to prostitution to serve punishment for her failure as she saw it. It is a must see movie for anyone that studies the existence of angels.
B003A9OVS0|1.0|The past three albums from the Gorillaz have been AWESOME! I absolutely love there music! I figured I would give it some time to grow on me as great music often needs a few plays to persuade you to love it... This album is downright TERRIBLE!!! And I hate to say it, but my friends who are fans of the Gorillaz feel the exact same way! :( I was really excited for this album too! Major letdown! Wouldn't recommend it to any gorillaz fans looking for even a sum what familiar sound. No Stars.
0061922315|5.0|Shilpi Somaya Gowda has written a captivating first novel about the meaning of family, motherhood, adoption, the search for self and cultural identity.  She tells the story of Asha from birth to early twenties through her own voice, that of her Indian biological mother, Kavita, and that of her American adoptive mother, Somer.     The novel is thoroughly engrossing - I read it in two days.  And yet the story, characters, issues and insights have stayed with me for weeks.  Shilpi Somaya Gowda's writing is imbued with wisdom that defies her youth.  She expresses some truisms of life so articulately that I found myself re-reading just to capture her phrasing.    This book will speak to you if you are someone who has searched or struggled with cultural identity, if you are a mother, if you are a daughter, if you are adopted or an adoptive parent, if you believe in marriage, if you want to explore the meaning of family, if you are interested in India, if you appreciate honest explorations of poverty and wealth, or if you love to read.  Somaya Gowda deftly touches on all of these without judgment or agenda.       Secret Daughter is a story about people and the paths their lives take.  The characters are real - interesting, flawed, and you care about them.  At the same time, Somaya Gowda manages to paint an extraordinarily rich portrait of modern India - the sharp contrast between its poverty and wealth, its traditions and culture.  Those sections of the novel seem painted in bright colors and I feel I've experienced something of India although I've never been there.      This novel is delightful.  It's one of those rare books that I'm willing to stay up all night for.  I found multiple threads within it that touch my own life and the book is very thought-provoking.  I highly recommend Secret Daughter and I recommend you read it with a friend, since you will be inspired to talk about it for some time to come.

0385333846|4.0|As always Vonnegut is a master of the succinct sentence and sublime art of maintaining one's attention.  This book is wickedly funny, delightfully sarcastic, and honestly heart-wrenching.  It is neither as insightful or well-written as Cat's Cradle, but it is far more touching and it takes a far more realistic view of life.  In all, this is a great book, and I highly recommend it.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|This is actually a really good slab of metal from Megadeth.  This was hot off the heels of \\"Rust in Peace\\", so it would have been easy to disappoint fans with almost anything.  I think Mustaine crafted a near perfect clean metal album.  He really laid the template out for how something should sound if bands were going to start commercializing their sound.  Marty Friedman really puts his stamp on this one as well.  It is easy to get all huffy and complain that they changed their sound and became more friendly, but on this album the transition was so smooth that you almost can't fault them.  It tends to be a failure for every 49 out of 50 bands, Megadeth just pulled it off really good.  \\"Ashes In Your Mouth\\" would fit next to any song on Rust In Peace.  \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" is such a great simple riff and song, and is a good hook song for new fans, yet old fans can still enjoy it.  The only other band that I can think of that is so good at making commercial and hard songs and do it so well is Judas Priest.  At least give this one an honest chance, the worst thing that could happen is you might like it.
B000HACVWI|5.0|Television seldom produces quality material at the level of Firefly. It's accessible, no techno talk needed, but it's so low-key effective you'll not really notice you're living inside it until it's over too soon. That there are so few episodes is the only thing wrong with Firefly.     If this program is new to you, also see the movie \\"Serenity\\" 2005, in the 3 years between the series and the movie, the people lost none of the feel or cohesion. You will be pleased that you chose this, it's a well-modulated balance of atmosphere,tension, wit and humor. Characters are remarkably well-defined, but watch for little tricks of dialog, intelligence not formula. Nothing formulaic about Firefly. It's Quality.

B000UGG39Q|3.0|The release of this album shows a group of guys getting together and playing together after a long hiatus.  It seems like they tried to re-capture the magic from the last two but it just wasn't there.  This does however get me excited for the next one now that Phil is gonna spend more time with this band as opposed to spreading himself thin on countless projects.  I think this album will help get them back into the rhythm for the next one.  There was just too much filler on here (I Scream, His Majesty the Desert, Pillamyd, In Thrall of it All, The Path) Some highlights include \\"N.O.D\\" which benefits from a nasty riff.  \\"Mourn\\" is an awesome song, and you can feel the emotion as Phil relives Dime's funeral.  \\"On March The Saints\\" is a triumphant riff  laden song.  Their first two albums were on a whole different level then this, I'm optimistic that the next one will be a masterpiece.  I would be happy with something half as good as \\"NOLA\\".
B0013FNC38|5.0|Radio played the devil out of I'm Yours that's on this album. It's still a good tune. It's got a great hook and is just plain catchy.    How about the rest of the album? Well it's worth staying around to listen to. His band is SMOKIN'. The horns are fabulous and the rhythm section is too. They're tight. Everything just fits together. Jason Mraz is a musician's musician. The guy can sing (beautiful voice) and he can entertain - these can be mutually exclusive, but not in his case. The writing is good. Excellent arrangements, too. The lyrics are very entertaining at times, touching at others.     There are few albums in which the entire album is good. This is one of them.     This album delivers on a lot of albums. I wish I had purchased it sooner.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|Loved the 1st Boondock Saints but this was the worst movie I have ever seen!  Atrocious writing and acting that was (I am hoping) trying to be camp but came across as high school amateurish.  My previous worse movie ever was Hang Up or Hanging Up - a piece of dreck starring Meg Ryan and that blonde chick from Friends - Boondock Saints 2 is actually much much worse than that.  Save yourself the money and time and just stare at a wall for an hour and a half - your life would be more enriched than sitting through this POS.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD about 2 1/2 weeks ago and I can already see the results.  I am not one of those exercise obsessed people who can or want to work out every day. I use this DVD 4 times a week along with a moderate diet.  It is easy to follow  - no crazy moves that require me to re wind just to follow the routine.  The three different work outs make it easy to stay engaged in the whole exercise regime.  I have a tendency to become bored in a few days and Jillian has kept me motivated and engaged.  It is short enough so that you don't dread working out and intense enough so that the 20 + minutes make a difference in a short time.  This is a great video for someone who wants to get back in shape for the warm weather.
B0000024LN|5.0|Muddy Waters would definatly have to be one of the sickest,filthiest,underated album to ever cross the hip hop era of the 90's. With the green eyed bandit behind most of the production, you can't possably go wrong with the beats. Only flaw with this album is that the songs are to short, which will make you feel bummed out after each song ends. But the supurb lyrics and outstanding flows by the funk dock the spot himself make up this phenominal album. Each track bangs hard with sick basslines  that shakes the ground ruff like an earthguake. A must have gem for your cd collection...    Intro.. funny skit, pretty much explains the theme of the album  Iz he 4 real.. 4/5, tight song, but very short  Rock da spot.. 4.5/5, Sick bassline with a awesome sample by biggie  welcome.. 4/5, eventhough it's an interlude, redman raps on it and kills it  case closed.. 2/5, one of the worst productions by rockwilder, which is a first. Lyrics by redman, rockwilder, and napalm      are great, but the beat killed it  Pick it up.. 5/5, great song and beat with tight lyrics and a sick chorus.  Smoke Boodah.. 5/5, a short song but a tight one. With a brilliant sample from the song mary jane by rick james. With funny lyrics and chorus make this song amazing.  Whateva man.. 6/5, my favorite song off the album, a laid back song to smoke a blunt to. The girl moaning in the background really sets the mood.  On Fire.. 5/5, sick song with a sick bass  Do what you feel.. 4/5, the beat is simple, but this song is tight for the fact that method man killed his verse and so did redman. The dynamic duo made this song fire  Creepin.. 3/5, songs alright, the beat was nothing special, felt repetitive.  It's like that.. 4/5, a great song to blow your speakers out, k-solo and redman murder this track and leave no evidence.  Da bump.. 5/5, a pretty sick beat with tight lyrics. Light your blunts up to this one.  Yesh yesh yall.. 5/5, very sick bassline and mysterious at the same time. Red kills this track aswell  What you lookin 4.. 4.5/5, great concept on the song with a sick sample by the isley brothers  Supaman luva 3.. 5/5, once again redman goes hard on the supaman series  Rollin.. 4.5/5, tight beat and lyrics, the beat reminds me of a prehistoric grimey verison of jurrasic park or something.  Da ill out.. 5/5, although the beat was simple, keith murray and jamal rip this track to shreds with their lyrics
B002LFPAUC|5.0|They only made twelve episodes....and then they stopped.<br />They could have gone further, but maybe Cleese was doing other things, maybe the money wasn't there, I'm not sure, it's not important. Bottom line is that, in my opinion, this ranks up there with the funniest TV shows of all-time.<br /><br />Here's an example: in the crabby deaf old lady (Mrs. Richards) episode, Basil has been betting on the horses, just to try and win some of his own money, and to try to squeeze out from under the iron thumb of wife Sibyl. Of course, the domineering Sibyl vehemently disapproves of Basil doing just about anything on his own. She has suspicions, and cooly says, \\"Basil, you know what I'm going to do if I find out you've been betting on the horses, don't you?\\" Basil shakes his head and does his best to appear studious, then mutters under his breath, out of her earshot, \\"You'll have to sew 'em back on first!\\"<br /><br />That is, his testicles! No American show would have been witty or daring enough to get that line in, forty years ago.<br /><br />Same episode: Mrs. Richards and Basil in her hotel room, and she's complaining about the view. Basil sarcastically replies, \\"And just what did you expect to see out of a Torquay hotel room window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeests sweeping majestically across the plains?\\"<br /><br />The writing, the characters, the situations, the dialogue, it's all perfect.<br />I've seen some of these episodes a dozen times, and I've never gotten tired of them. This latest remastering is beautiful, particularly because of the improved picture quality and the inclusion of Cleese's commentary.<br /><br />Here is a listing in no order of the TV shows I think are particularly funny, definitely a cut above your ordinary sitcom: Larry Sanders (may be the funniest show ever on TV, this side of pond or not); Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, SCTV, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, Keeping Up Appearances, The League of Gentlemen, Little Britain, and Monty Python's Flying Circus.nty Python's Flying Circus.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study was the largest, most comprehensive human nutrition study in history.   The China Study was the culmination of a 20 year partnership between Cornell University, Oxford University and the Chinese Academy Of Preventative Medicine.   It is the legacy of Dr. T. Colin Campbell.    Dr. T Colin Campbell ( 1934 -  ) grew up on a dairy farm in Northern Virginia.  For about 50 years Dr. Campbell has been at the forefront of nutrition research.  Dr. Campbell is a Jacob Gould Schurman Professor  Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University.  Dr. Campbell has received  more than 70 grant years of peer reviewed research funding.  He has authored more than 300 research papers and  received the Research Achievement Award in 1998 from the American Institute of Cancer Research.    Dr. Campbell opens, his book, \\"The China Study\\" by telling us that the top killers of Americans are ( in descending order, page 16 ):      1.  Cardiovascular disease   2.  Cancer   3.  Medical Care  4.  Cerebrovascular Diseases (strokes)   5.  Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases   6.  Accidents   7.  Diabetes Mellitus   8.  Influenza and Pneumonia   9.  Alzheimer's Disease       The population of the United States is about 300 million people.   Out of those 300 million Americans 82% have at least 1 risk factor for heart disease.   Over 280,000 Americans died from strokes, diabetes or Altzeimer's Disease in the year 2000.   During any given week 50% - 80% of Americans take at least one medication or one prescription drug.   65% of Americans are overweight and 31% of Americans are obese ( page 346 ).    People can't be kept in a cages, so nutrition studies on human beings are both rare and valuable.   They are incredibly valuable because animals are not people.  What works/doesn't work for common lab animals ( rats, rabbits, mice, etc..) often doesn't/does work for human beings.    The China Study had the huge advantage of being done in China, where for the most part, even in thepresent day,  people don't move around much.  They will live in the same area and eat the same diet for most of their lives.  Composed of distinct cultures with different economic advantages, regional diets in China will vary greatly.    Dr. Campbell found that Chinese people who live in regions that eat diets similar to Americans die in much the same ways and numbers that Americans do.      Dr. Campbell also found that Chinese people who lived in regions where animal products are scarce ( i.e. 4 ounces of meat a day, 3 - 4 thin slices of cold cuts )  did not experience the terminal diseases that Americans do in anywhere near the same numbers.  Even when attempting to adjust for physical activity.    The message of Dr. Campbell's book, \\"The China Study\\", is that if you want to avoid dying and more importantly suffering from,  the list of diseases above eat a plant based diet of  whole  plant foods.    I like to read about nutrition, so the nuts and bolts of the book that other people might find interesting I did not and vice-versa.    The first thing I found interesting in this book, is the list of the top killers of Americans.  I have seen that list many times over many years.   Never with item number 3 on it.   According to Dr. Campbell physician error, medication error,  hospital borne infections and adverse events from drugs or surgery kill 225,400 Americans a year( page 15 ).  Reads like a good argument for getting serious about preventative self health care doesn't it?  Exactly Dr. Campbell's point    The other points I found interesting  were in regards low carbohydrate diets. Many of the proponents of low carbohydrate diets have the near-conspiracy theory idea that low fat diets recommended by the scientific establishment only served to make American's fatter.  In Dr. Campbell's own words ( page 95 ):    ========================  \\"One of the fundamental arguments at the beginning of most low carbohydrate, high-protein diet books is that America has been wallowing in low-fat mania at the advice of experts for the past twenty years, but there is one inconvenient fact that is consistently ignored:  according to a report summarizing government food statistics, \\"Americans consumed thirteen pounds more fats and oils per person in 1997 than in 1970, up from 52.6 to 65.6 pounds.\\"  It is true that we have had a trend toward consuming fewer of our total calories as fat, when considered as a percentage, but that's only because we have outpaced our gorging on fat by gorging on sugary junk food.  Simply by looking at the numbers, anybody can see that America has not adopted the \\"low-fat\\" experiment-- not by an stretch of the imagination.  \\"  =========================      In other words,  Americans  as a whole, were never on a low fat diet.  Americans are fatter now because Americans have been eating more calories overall.    Again, nothing new.  You can read the same information in more detail in the August 2004 edition of The National Geographic (pages 46 - 61), \\"Why are Americans so fat\\" by Cathy Newman ( not quoted in this book ).    My primary complaint with this book is the title.  A more accurate title would have been \\"What I have learned during my 50 year career of nutrition research\\".   The actual \\"China Study\\" takes up a chunk of the book, but only a chunk.       I would have enjoyed reading more about the actual \\"China Study\\".    The bulk of the book is taken up by Dr. Campbell trying to demonstrate that the idea that animal products bring disease and that whole food plant based diets bring health is not a new scientific discovery.  In fact, he claims it goes back at least 30 - 40 years.    Why haven't you heard of this before?   Well, that is the title of  Part IV of his book, the last 92 pages or so.    Do not expect a typical hippie health food conspiracy theory rant about payoffs and evil plots.  Dr. Campbell has been one of the top researchers in the U.S. for about half a century.  Many of the scientists and officials he has criticism for he knows on a first name basis.   Dr. Campbell gives the reader, instead, a very sophisticated account of how health information does not make it out to the average person and more importantly, how seemingly conflicting medical information ends up in the popular media.    Reading this section of the book will give you a valuable perspective on how to view reports on any given study you might find in the news.    Since I waited so long to read this book, I have read many popular criticisms of it.    As a popular reader,  I haven't come across any critics with Dr. Campbell's credentials,  who have addressed a fraction of the over 730 references of this book, who have read all of his research or who are involved in the same research as he was.   I'm not saying that such scholarly papers aren't there, but that is not where I have seen the bulk of criticism coming from.    Some of the popular criticisms of this book are flat out ridiculous.  For example, that Dr. Campbell wrote this book because he is a vegetarian and in league with animal rights activists.    These \\"critics\\" have never read this book or they would have seen this quote (page 107 )      =====================  \\"The results of this study, in addition to a mountain of supporting research, some of it my own and some of it from other scientists, convinced me to turn my dietary lifestyle around.      I stopped eating meat fifteen years ago, and I stopped eating  almost all animal-based foods, including dairy, within the past six to eight years, except on very rare occasions.  My cholesterol has dropped, even as I've aged; I am more physically fit now than when I was twenty-five; and I am forty-five pounds lighter now than I was when I was thirty years old.  I am now at a ideal weight for my height.\\"  =============================      Furthermore, Dr. Campbell describes animal experiments he conducted and defends those experiments.  That is something of an anathema to almost every kind of animal rights ideology.      None of what Dr. Campbell has to say is all that new.   A number of well credentialed experts over the years have been saying pretty much similar things.  The entire book could be successfully condemned by the critics ( far from happening ) but the main message would still stand.      Eating a plant based diet of whole plant foods promotes health,  eating a diet high in animal products brings disease.    I do think the book takes on too much and doesn't walk the reader through enough tight conclusions.   I think some parts of it could have been shorter without losing any information.  I also think some parts were much too dense.    I do think from the perspective of the full content of this book, that this book is one of the most valuable books any American can read.    Putting the message into practice in your life can save your life and make you a happier person while you are living it.    This book is old enough to be in many library systems, as well as used book venues.   The only thing to lose, besides early diminishing health, is a few afternoons of your time to read this book.    It is worth it.

B000HEWEEE|4.0|Any movie with Sandra Bullock is worth watching, but this really good chick flick is also one of the few that I enjoyed, as a member of the another male who belongs to the \\"Don't like chick flicks lodge\\".  It's well presented and keeps you wondering how would I approach someone who won't love me for another 2 years.  The two lovers are 2 years apart, but a mailbox allows them to send messages back and forth over the 2 year time span, without knowing what the other looks like.  The pace of the movie is excellent, and it does challenge your brain.  You won't be able to just predict what happens next in this one. This movie is well worth the money I paid for it.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I saw this adaptation of Austen's novel on Masterpiece before I saw the 1995 Amanda Root version and before I read the book.  I fell in love with the story and the two lead characters; the strength of their attachment and the circumstances of their story involved me emotionally in a way I had not expected from an Austen novel.  I love Austen's books, but the ones I've read (Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Northanger Abbey) are more light-hearted and less affecting than this one is.    This adaptation is not as faithful to the book as the Amanda Root version, but it works well because it focuses on how Anne and Wentworth feel and how those feelings change during the story.  The first time I watched it, I was wondering what was going on with Wentworth, but he was a bit confused himself, and it all became clear in the end.  Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins were great in their individual roles and there was good chemistry between them, especially in the very last scene, which was not in the book, but which I absolutely loved.      Also, this adaptation shows us in \\"real time\\" a few scenes that we only learn about at the end in the book.  This is a hard book to adapt, I think, because so much of the action is internal to the characters, so this change helped the story flow better for someone who hadn't yet read the book.       Like many other reviewers, I am not a fan of the running around at the end, because it seemed so unrealistic for someone of Anne's class to have done at the time, but again, it did do a wonderful job of conveying the emotion of the moment.  I think if the BBC and PBS had just given the producers an extra ten minutes of running time to work with, this would have been wonderful.  Then, the role of Mrs. Smith and her relationship with William Elliot could have been made clearer and more important, and we could have seen more of the interaction between Anne and Wentworth at the end of the story.      This adaptation did inspire me to watch the Amanda Root version (which I liked, but not quite as much as this one), and to read the book, which I loved.  It's now my favorite Austen book and Wentworth has replaced Darcy as my favorite romantic hero.      If you are a purist, you may not like this adaptation much, but if you're willing to allow the screen writer a few liberties, or haven't read the book, you may find you really like this movie.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|One of the best vampire series I've ever seen, but it is not for the timid.  The sex scenes and language would make many blush.  It could be called a porno if you only wanted to watch the sex scenes, so don't let your children watch this one. If you like vampires, that can take a bite out of your previous concepts of vampires this is the series for you.
0307463745|5.0|I'm a big fan of DHH and Jason Fried, their ideas are definitely controversial in the global business space. However with the small business upstarts they are like spreading the gospel.  Meetings are toxic, the way a lot of businesses operate is really out of wack with whats going on in todays market. I really enjoyed the book even tho I've read most of their work already it was nice seeing the book distilled in one place.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A fabulous series that was killed in its first season.  Shame on HBO for allowing whomever to kill this great Sci Fi series.  The action is great and the story is believable.  This is the story of a group of misfits who end up together in a space ship that goes around from planet to planet just trying to scrap together a living, but always ended up in trouble.  The cast is fantastic, it makes me a big fan of Nathan Fillion, and you'll love the other cast members.  One of them is now the alien leader in the new series \\"V\\", another is the cyborg in the series Terminator.  Nathan now has a new series \\"Castle\\" so I like their new stuff but I'm sad there will not be anymore episodes of this fabulous series.  This one is worth twice what I had to pay for it.
0199540594|5.0|Certainly Marcus Aurelius Antonius is one of the great philosophers.  Known as a \\"stoic\\", it might be better to look at him as a rather common-sensical person who has thought long and hard about the world and humans' place in it.  This is a good book for reading just before going to bed.  The tone is peaceful, quiet and lends itself very well to contemplation.  If you have not read any of his material, this book is a good place to start.

B002WY65VU|5.0|Best zombie movie ever!  Yes, better than Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days Later!  It's that good.  Coolest zombie movie ever.  Woody H. was a real superstar.  Funniest and scariest.  Very scary and creepy.  Big trucks, a hot chick, lots of guns and ammo, sweet references to Texas, lots of gory zombie kills, inspirational rules to live by, and God loves Rednecks!  Yeah!!!!  One hell of a wild movie ride!  Genius....makes me want to go to the movies again and I'm not happy I missed seeing this at the theaters.  You can blame the Watchmen movie for making me not trust movies anymore.  But I absolutely loved this movie...I wish I had seen it in the theaters.  Got to now get it in Bluray to keep the madness going on all possible levels.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever designed by a group of men you will ever find from the 20th Century.  The killer bunny, the virgins, the weird prince who wants to sing, the lack of horses for the knights, the Knights who once said Ni.  The movie is full of extras and so is are the DVDs.  Legos, sing-alongs, on-screen screenplay, commentaries full of back-stabbing, complaints and whining by the crew of Month Python.  Looking for a message?  Well, there may be a few, but mostly it was meant to be funny, the kind of funny that burns into your brain and slowly burns its way out, till you laugh aloud on the bus, or at the wedding, or when they are trying to pull a tooth.  The kind of funny that hits you right when you're trying to chew that very hard piece of beef that you think MAY be bone, but you don't wish to spit it out, because that would be bad manners.<br />Well, enough of that.  Just buy it already.  I would also suggest you buy [[ASIN:B00005OKQK Jabberwocky]] and [[ASIN:6305388458 Life of Brian]] DVDs.  If you don't I'll send a bunny after you.

B002VPEAOE|4.0|I'm writing this review with my poor banged up knee in the air instead of skiing as I would like to be doing. This may be making me more forgiving than usual; I really kind of liked this book.<br /><br />My sister gave this to me as part of her quest to get me to admit that romance novels aren't all awful. Her other two stabs this direction were notably unsuccessful, so I approached the Morton with a grim eye. Not only is this a romance, but a historical romance to boot. Perhaps my expectations were so low that they were bound to be exceeded?<br /><br />I liked it. Morton seems to have a decent grasp of history, which is usually what makes me hate historical fiction. The prose quality was good, unpretentious, with a minimum of the flowery fuss that generally accompanies the genre. It kept me reading at a point when I really needed distraction, which was definitely a Good Thing.<br /><br />It isn't perfect by a long shot. I am very tired of historical novels featuring servant girls with Significant Question Marks hanging over their parentage. Morton telegraphed her intentions here so obviously she might as well have put the 'secret' on the back cover. The ending is also not particularly well done-- it seemed the writer was more interested in her character's relationship with each other than she was with their erstwhile lover. Can't blame her for that really, but the last section felt like an incomplete afterthought.<br /><br />All in all-- a decent read. Good entertainment if you're in the mood. And coming from someone who traditionally dislikes precisely this genre, that's a ringing endorsement.
B002VJ0576|1.0|If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan you will be monstrously disappointed by this cheap cash in on the Downey Jr reworking. The plot is ludicrous and infantile, as is the script and acting. Ben Syder is totally miscast as the detective, in fact, he is the worst Holmes I've seen next to Patrick Macnee in 'The Hound of London', and he stunk to high Heaven!
B002N1AEN2|3.0|17? 18?  They have the whole world ahead of them and the promise shown in this debut means it could be quite spectacular.  So why only 3 stars?  The album and their reputation was made primarily on the first 4 songs.  Crystalized should be at the top of any singles list for 2009 and Intro, VCR and Islands are right there with it.  Infinity would be too, but it suffers a little too much from Chris Isaak-ness...    The rest is a little more average.  Not that that's a terrible thing.  If you've written an album like this at 17, you've done quite a lot with your life...

B000ION23A|2.0|We've seen plenty of CGI-animated films that involve talking ants (Antz, A Bug's Life). The Ant Bully is the most recent one, released back in 2006, and I have to say that it's the weakest of them all. Not to say that it's incredibly bad, but it's still pretty mediocre. The good things about this film are the ants themselves: I found myself admiring their personalities and even their appearances. The animation looks good in some corners, and the orchestral score sounds great, even if it isn't very memorable. I especially like the lack of pop culture references that are typically found in today's CGI-animated films. Unfortunately, these things aren't enough to save the film. The story is predictable (even kids will probably figure out how it all ends), the human supporting characters are dull, the main character (the kid) is an especially unbelievable bore, and the jokes are very VERY stale. Like I said, it's not a terrible film, but it's not a good one either. This one is just below mediocre.<br /><br />Grade: D+
B001M5UDGS|5.0|\\"Doctor Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is a musical about a mad scientist (Doctor Horrible) who wants to make it into this evil league, but so far all of his plots have been foiled by Captain Hammer.  We end up seeing two plot lines that twist together in this story, as Doctor Horrible's actually a normal guy named Billy when he's not bent on causing evil.  Billy has fallen in love with Penny and wants to get into the evil league and take over the world.  He figures that it'll be easy enough, but Captain Hammer not only ruins his plan but steals his girl too.<br /><br />The cast is simply amazing!  If you love Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and/or Felicia Day then this is the movie for you!  I have to say that Nathan Fillion's portrayal of Captain Hammer was even reminiscent of his role on \\"Castle\\" at time which made it even more fun!  Neil Patrick Harris is just simply wonderful in this!  And though Felicia Day doesn't seem as well known as the other two in the cast, she is simply wonderful to watch and listen to her sing!  I absolutely love her in \\"The Guild\\" and in this!<br /><br />I have to say that I didn't set the bar very high when I was told about this, but I watched it and thought that it was simply fantastic!  It's fun and the tunes totally stay with you.  I have the soundtrack on my iPod now!  I'd recommend this for people who like either anything that this fantastic cast is in or if you don't know any of the actors then it'd be a safe bet if you like musicals and comics ;)<br /><br />This is a very fun superhero-type of show.<br /><br />It has a very different feeling though, I think, because I found myself rooting for Doctor Horrible instead of Captain Hammer.<br /><br />Plus, it's Joss Whedon's so you know it's pure brilliance :D
B00328G4V6|4.0|Very nice indeed.<br /><br />These recordings were made between February and May 1969 This is another in the series of posthumous recordings put out by the Hendrix family that's truly outstanding. Hendrix would record and re record songs until he was happy with every note in the song. On this CD the producers have done it right giving it the tame kind of love and devotion to getting the recording right just as Jimi would have made sure every note was right.<br /><br />Featured here are several remakes that are markedly different then the originals. Some that aren't quite as good as the originals, Stone free seems like it needed a little more studio work but is still very good.  Hear my Train is just as good as the original and features a different guitar solo, this one really stands out to me. Red house is another favorite, bluesy sounding, Valley's of Neptune is an outstanding studio version, I had previously I had only heard this song on bootleg recordings. Fire is another outstanding alternate to the original. The version of Sunshine of your love is fairly up-tempo compared to Creams version. Even the lesser known songs like Mr. Bad Luck (eventually this became Look over yonder), lullaby for the summer and Crying Blue rain are very good. The bonus songs Slow version and Trash man are both instrumental and are ok but not up to par with the other twelve songs.<br /><br />There was a lot of time, love and energy poured into production and engineering of these recordings. I think if Jimi were alive today he would be happy with the result based on what the engineers had to work with. It's an amazing production and engineering feat considering these recordings were made in 1969.  All made possible by the genius that Jimi was and continues to be even in death. The CD comes with a booklet that talks about the recording sessions that's very helpful.<br /><br />This CD is another testament to Jimi's skill and genius as a musician.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I got this headset in hopes of resolving some minor problems with my older X3's, which included things like bass sounding too muffled, hard staticky \\"s\\" sounds in dialogue, and discomfort after a few hours; just to name a few. I had already decided before looking that I wanted to stick with Turtle Beach, because despite those few issues with my older set, I felt that overall it was a good quality product.    When I tried the x41's for the first time, I noticed an immediate difference. They were significantly more comfortable, and the sound quality was very clear and rich. It was definately an improvement to my previous set. However, at the same time, I also noticed that there was bit more ambient static/hissing during quieter moments or when the volume is turned all the way down, but it wasn't so bad that it was too distracting; until you plug in the mic cable, which then causes it to get a little worse. Also, if you are near a wireless router, it may cause a bit of interferance (popping, cracking, etc).    Within the first month of owning the X41's, I was back and forth on whether or not I wanted to return them. I weighed the pros and cons and in the end, I decided to keep them. I came to realize that the static actually gets drowned out amidst the gameplay anyway, and when I plug in the mic cable, it does get a bit worse, but it's easily adaptable after a short period of time. As for the router interferance, all I did was move it to a different room and the problem was completely gone. There's also the issue with the battery life, but that was easily resolved by getting some rechargeable batteries. I have had these for a little over a year now, and as odd as it sounds, things have improved more than worsen. I guess it takes a bit of a break-in period.    Also, about 4 months ago I had accidentally broken off the tip of the mic cable inside the controller. After I got it out, I called Turtle Beach support and I couldn't have been happier with their service. I received a new cable free of charge within the same week.    So to sum up, this headset isn't perfect, but for what it has to offer, it is a decent headset for late night gaming or when you want a surround sound experience without breaking the bank.    I hope this review was helpful :]

0316010669|3.0|After following Gladwell in the New Yorker, and enjoying his most recent work \\"Tipping Point\\", I've been eagerly awaiting the release of his newest piece, \\"Blink\\".  Gladwell is the king of common sense, many of the points he addresses are based on what we already know.  But I suppose that's the exact reason I enjoy his work so much.  What many of us, not excluding myself, sometimes fail to recognize about the current understanding of the brain and human reactions - Gladwell saturates himself in.  Secondly, being a lifelong fan of the Getty - I was pleasantly surprised with his remarkable insights into the museum as well.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|It took The Offspring a long time to come out with this album, but it is well worth it.  Rise & Fall, Rage & Grace stays true to the Offspring's high energy style while still sounding fresh.  I found all the songs to be good, and there are three slower songs on the CD spaced just right to mix things up and keep all the songs from starting to sound the same.  The Offspring has been one of my favorite bands for many years, and as a long term listener I was not disappointed with this CD at all.  The band members are in their mid 40's now, but his album shows that they have developed well with experience triumphing over age.    A note to parents buying this for their kids, assuming that their kids know whom these guys are, in typical Offspring fashion, this CD is loaded with profanity, but somehow it still seems to fit well with the songs and doesn't seem to be overbearing and unnecessary, although there is a lot of it.

0446567337|1.0|I bought this on my Kindle while on vacation thinking it would be a romantic, sad, light reading perfect for the beach.  After reading part 1, the book was so dull, uninspiring, and insipid that I put the book away for weeks and only finished it because my daughter wanted to read it and I wanted to make sure the rest was appropriate for her.  I can't believe I paid money for this crap.  The characters are 1 dimensional stereotypes.  I find Savannah pretty unlikeable and her behavior an utter mystery to me.  Why would such a perfect, caring, loving, good, Christian woman behave as she did?  I also did not like the way he treats Autism in the book - it's as if he realized it's a \\"hot topic\\" these days so threw it in after reading a magazine article about Autism - very shallow and disrespectful.  I found it boring and annoying, and not in a good way. I don't mind a book that makes me feel something, even if it's hate, as long as I'm emotionally involved.  This book didn't engage me at all.  I knew exactly what was going to happen and I didn't care about any characters other than John and his dad.  That said, the middle school girls in our town LOVE this book and that made me realize that this is exactly the immature, uncomplicated, romantic drivel that a young girl would enjoy.  However, because of the casual treatment of sex and love (which was surprising given the part 1 treatment of such), I won't let my daughter read it yet.

The actors were just perfect and the dialogs memorable. J J Abrams did a very good job, and in my opnion the history is even better than Avatar. I don't know why it did not get, at least, more Oscar indications, maybe it was just prejudice...  Buy this Blu-Ray, you won't regret.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Twenty years after the original smash-hit \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (which knocked \\"Cats\\" off it's scratching post in 2006 as the longest-running musical in Broadway history), Andrew Lloyd Webber has finally come through with the long-awaited sequel, LOVE NEVER DIES.<br /><br />LOVE NEVER DIES picks up the story ten years after the events of the original \\"Phantom\\".  Following his mysterious disappearance in the underground lair, the Phantom was quickly spirited away to America by Madame Giry and her daughter Meg; and has now established himself as the most successful, albeit mysterious, impresario of New York's bustling Coney Island fairground.  For his latest venture at \\"Phantasma\\", the Phantom--using the new alias of Mr Y.--finally manages to lure his beloved opera singer Christine Daa&eacute;, her husband Raoul and their young son Gustave, to perform in America for the first time...and the scene looks set for a dramatic confrontation...<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber hasn't had a hit new musical in years (\\"The Beautiful Game\\" was a forgettable mess, and \\"The Woman in White\\" failed spectacularly on Broadway despite a respectable, two-year London run); so the stakes were high for Lloyd Webber to extend the story for his most successful, beloved and most personal work.  Does it succeed?  Well, yes and no.  Ben Elton's plot (loosely adapted from Frederick Forsyth's \\"Phantom of Manhattan\\") has enraged longtime \\"Phans\\", who have denounced it as nothing more than illogical, worst case-scenario fan-fiction, the characters bear little resemblance to how they were seen or portrayed in the original \\"Phantom\\"; and the score swings, almost wildly in places, from inspired to mundane.<br /><br />Despite it all, though, Andrew Lloyd Webber has beautifully furnished the world premiere cast of his LOVE NEVER DIES with two performers who have also played their roles in productions of the original \\"Phantom\\".  Ramin Karimloo is a particularly romantic Phantom with a voice direct from heaven; Sierra Boggess--who most recently originated the title role in Broadway's \\"The Little Mermaid\\"--is delightful as Christine.  If there is one thing that slightly worries me about Karimloo and Boggess, it is the issue of their relative youth, which definitely plays against the reality of their characters being ten years older!  As such, it would have been a dream come true to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman back in their trademark roles, but in light of the incredibly demanding score (and indeed, Brightman's reluctance to re-enter the musical theatre scene), I understand completely why this was perhaps never even possible in the first place.<br /><br />All of the characters make quite dramatic transformations in LOVE NEVER DIES, but perhaps the biggest is Raoul.  Ten years after winning the hand of Christine, Raoul (played by Joseph Millson) is now an embittered, drunken mess, resentful of Christine and Gustave, still haunted by his past battles with the Phantom (and, to top it all off, suspicious of Gustave's true parentage!).  A far cry from the bright-eyed lad who once professed his undying love to Christine on the Paris Opera rooftop by singing \\"All I Ask of You\\".  Summer Strallen is Meg, who has given up ballet to become the Phantom's headlining \\"Ooh-La-La Girl\\"; and Sally Dexter plays the ever-mysterious Madame Giry.<br /><br />The best numbers in the show are those that Andrew Lloyd Webber wisely used in the official LOVE NEVER DIES press launch, namely \\"The Coney Island Waltz\\" (an eerie melody with shades of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" in it's opening strains), and the Phantom's soaring ballad \\"'Til I Hear You Sing\\".  Raoul and the Phantom's \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" duet harks back to their stormy vocal tauntings in the original \\"Phantom\\" score.  The title song (\\"Love Never Dies\\", sung by Christine at the climax of the second act) is merely a re-tread of a piece that ALW previously slotted into \\"The Beautiful Game\\", entitled \\"Our Kind of Love\\", but apparently it always meant for the eventual Phantom sequel, according to the composer at least.  Glenn Slater's lyrics serve their purpose.<br /><br />The storyline will forever shatter the romantic dreams of diehard \\"Phans\\", the score is brilliant in some places but sketchy in others, and the overall tone of the piece wildly shifts during the course of events.  It's never going to achieve the same level of success or adoration as the original \\"Phantom\\", let alone threat it's position as the longest-running musical Broadway has ever seen, but it's fine footnote if nothing else.m sequel, according to the composer at least.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|My husband and I were both enthralled by Master and Commander from beginning to end. I had forgotten all about it and did not remember whether it had good reviews upon release, but I picked it up at the video store to rent on a whim. We both enjoy English history, sailing and Russell Crowe so I thought it would be worth $4 to give it a look. What a perfect movie night we had.    The film is visually breathtaking. The attention to every detail of costume and set design is remarkable. You really do feel as though you were on an early 19th century war ship, creaky, leaky and rum-soaked in the bowels but erudite and elegant in the captain's quarters. Unlike many special effects extravaganzas and costume dramas, this is not a poor-to-mediocre film in a fancy package. The script is witty, the character development is effective, the pacing brisk, and the acting from Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany and the supporting cast reliably excellent. It is fascinating to watch how the ship works. It's really a microcosm of British society at the beginning of its great 19th century imperial expansion (albeit without women), with its class distinctions and power structures. Crowe's character, the ship's captain, represents pragmatic, confident leadership and the conviction that Britain knows what should be done and shall make sure it gets done. Paul Bettany's character, the ship's physician, represents the intellectual curiosity that led to the industrial revolution and the theory of evolution. The battle scenes are engrossing, and with a few exceptions, I don't really care for war movies.     Although it's rated PG-13 and some scenes are probably too intense for young children (especially the scene where a child sailor has his arm amputated without benefit of anesthesia), I really did not see anything objectionable for any age group.     I'm off to order DVDs for my husband for our anniversary and for my father-in-law for Father's Day. This is a gem of a film.

As such, it would have been a dream come true to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman back in their trademark roles, but in light of the incredibly demanding score (and indeed, Brightman's reluctance to re-enter the musical theatre scene), I understand completely why this was perhaps never even possible in the first place.<br /><br />All of the characters make quite dramatic transformations in LOVE NEVER DIES, but perhaps the biggest is Raoul.  Ten years after winning the hand of Christine, Raoul (played by Joseph Millson) is now an embittered, drunken mess, resentful of Christine and Gustave, still haunted by his past battles with the Phantom (and, to top it all off, suspicious of Gustave's true parentage!).  A far cry from the bright-eyed lad who once professed his undying love to Christine on the Paris Opera rooftop by singing \\"All I Ask of You\\".  Summer Strallen is Meg, who has given up ballet to become the Phantom's headlining \\"Ooh-La-La Girl\\"; and Sally Dexter plays the ever-mysterious Madame Giry.<br /><br />The best numbers in the show are those that Andrew Lloyd Webber wisely used in the official LOVE NEVER DIES press launch, namely \\"The Coney Island Waltz\\" (an eerie melody with shades of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" in it's opening strains), and the Phantom's soaring ballad \\"'Til I Hear You Sing\\".  Raoul and the Phantom's \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" duet harks back to their stormy vocal tauntings in the original \\"Phantom\\" score.  The title song (\\"Love Never Dies\\", sung by Christine at the climax of the second act) is merely a re-tread of a piece that ALW previously slotted into \\"The Beautiful Game\\", entitled \\"Our Kind of Love\\", but apparently it always meant for the eventual Phantom sequel, according to the composer at least.  Glenn Slater's lyrics serve their purpose.<br /><br />The storyline will forever shatter the romantic dreams of diehard \\"Phans\\", the score is brilliant in some places but sketchy in others, and the overall tone of the piece wildly shifts during the course of events.  It's never going to achieve the same level of success or adoration as the original \\"Phantom\\", let alone threat it's position as the longest-running musical Broadway has ever seen, but it's fine footnote if nothing else.m sequel, according to the composer at least.

B00337KM2S|5.0|I've been wanting to see this -- and was not disappointed! It's a comedy, yes -- and I'll remember all his tips about packing and airports -- but it's also a painfully truthful look at today's America in a devastating economy that continues to affect everyone and everything.<br /><br />Clooney is, as always, marvelous -- and the rest of the cast are terrific. Not to be missed.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|Take this movie for what it was meant to be: pure visual spectacle with lots of effects, silly plot elements, forced emotion, desperation, and goofy stuff like carrying elephants and giraffes by helicopter to the big arks.    Don't make it about any more than that, don't take it seriously, and you will be just fine.

B0036B8MXC|4.0|It's really  hard to believe that any human could survive as much injury and blood loss as these gladiators do.  But if you can put that aside, you will enjoy the bloody violence, sex, swearing, gross stuff, family drama, Roman politics and intrigues, and the rest.    You can't help rooting for the Thracian man who is taken into slavery as a gladiator nicknamed Spartacus and forced to fight, all the while wondering whether his abducted and enslaved wife is dead or alive.  You will also find the other characters engaging:  his dominus and domina, the gladiators' trainer, the other fighters, the slaves, etc.      This is Rome meets Gladiator meets Raimi/Tapert with a moderate budget.  The CGI people and the city models are fake-looking, but this hardly matters in the larger scheme.

6304779607|5.0|Since it was so overdue we decided to get back to basics and finally tackle the Stallone classic Cobra. Judging from our extensive past of some of the world's greatest B you may be asking why did it take so long for the review on this one? Well it's simple. Cobra is somewhere in that back pocket selection we've created for ourselves. For us it's one of those classics that is very easy to access forcing it to get knocked behind some harder to find B. So the other evening when it appeared on a favorite action channel we decided it was the perfect time to reintroduce ourselves to the man known as Marion Cobretti.<br /><br />Right from the start it becomes clear this is easily one of Stallone's top 5 most B films as he takes the scene in a local grocery store. The dialogue is something that is almost too hilarious to even comprehend. With lines like \\"I don't deal with psychos. I put them away,\\" \\"go head I don't shop here,\\" and \\"you're a disease and I'm the cure\\" you will be left in a state of pure shock from some of the finest scripted lines in the history of film. Stallone plays Lt. Cobretti \\"Cobra\\" that's hot on the trail of a new murderous cult wreaking havoc in his city. Once the lunatics take aim at Brigitte Nielsen (whose hot according to Santa) Cobra takes his game to another level in the a** kicking department. He proves that no maniac, cult, or army could do anything except slightly inconvenience him as he brings them time once broken nose at a time.<br /><br />Cobra has held up so well over time easily earning itself a 5 star ratting. There is so much going on here it's hard to write about it without going on for hours. Honestly the writing is something that is nothing more then mind boggling as the ultra tough one liners pour out with no end until the credits roll. It's a film that truly hard to wrap your head around unless your a very large advocate of the B arts. See for us this film is pure gold and even inspired an interesting thought (without any mind altering substances involved). We started to think how amazing it would be if two iconic Stallone characters in Marion Cobretti and Frank Leonne would join forces in the ultimate criminal take down team. That is something the may make the t.v screen explode from sheer B overload.s involved).

0823015033|4.0|This book is a great place to start sculpting humanoids.  I would partner this book with the other once just like it on animals, as it's much easier to be objective about critters than about sculpting a human.  The author's approach is great, she encourages you to customize your own tool set and has great gesture and line.  Plenty of photos and samples and enough step by step to get the point across while still keeping you focused on the clay, not reading a technical manual.
B003102JDM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had me completely hooked from beginning to end. There wasn't a false note. I understand why several did not like it.  All I know is that I did.
0061537969|5.0|I read a lot of books, about 20 per year.  This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read; so much so, that I am writing my first review right now.  Being a dog lover, a friend gave me this book.  Enzo, the dog narrator, is loveable and logical and entertaining, in his observations of humankind.  I'll be reading the other books by Stein.
1416914307|5.0|I just finished the third book of the Mortal Instruments, City of Glass. I really liked this book a lot, it kept me enthralled in it the whole time. I really like how all the books were so intricately woven together that you didn't really catch what was going to happen until it did, but looking back there were always clues woven in so subtly that you still were surprised.<br /><br />***Spoiler warning***<br /><br />Even though I enjoyed the book, like the last one it had some discrepancies that left me going, wait a second! I will list a couple that I think I saw. For instance, when Simon was in the jail and Raphael comes to see him Simon says it is the first time he has seen Raphael since he was turned. But Simon previously talked about how Raphael had talked to him about some stuff, plus Simon knew some of the vampires names like he had hung out with them a couple times. Also, Simon said that after he was a Daylighter Raphael didn't like the fact that he didn't roam at night anymore. That would make you think that Simon had had contact with Raphael before the Jail incident.<br /><br />Also, there was a point were Clary said she hadn't seen Magnus since he took the book from her. But, after Sebastian left Alec said Magnus helped perform the tracking spell on his stuff. Now, Clary might have not been there when that happened, but when Alec told her don't you think she would have asked about Magnus? Especially since she thought he just took the book and ran without helping her mom? Just saying...<br /><br />I also didn't like the fact that Max death wasn't in more detailed. How did it happen? How did Isabelle escape? It was never fully described which left you wondering. Isabelle could have told more to Simon when he was comforting her but she didn't, which left you feeling like you missed something.<br /><br />There were a lot of other points where I felt I was missing something, but all together I really liked the books. I liked the angles she did. Making Vampires a little different than we were use to. Making the bad guy related was also a good move too. I can't wait for the fourth installment to come out and of course The Clockwork Angel as well.Making the bad guy related was also a good move too.

B00005JLF5|5.0|When I was a kid back in the 60's my dad made us leave a neighbors dinner so that we could watch the first episode of \\"Star Trek\\".  Since then I have been a \\"treky\\" (sp) & have watched it & every incarnation since the beginning.  I haven't gotten into the newer Star Trek where it starts with a brand new James T. Kirk because it feels more like their just trying to ruin what I grew up with.  Deep Space 9, Voyager & TNG are all spin-offs of the original & that makes them, in my book - it makes them that much better because the story lines & new graphics & special effects make them that much better.  DS9 is a wonderful spin-off of Star Trek & being that it revolves around a space station rather than the constant going here & there in the universe makes it special in it's own way.  I give the DS9 series a 10 thumbs up!!!<br /><br />Maria Maulorico, daughter of Alfred Maulorico the first & best Star Trek junky I ever knew.
0312360258|4.0|My mom's boyfriend's daughter, who is 13, and happens to like some of the same books as me let me borrow her House of Night Series. I think I saw these on amazon before, but thought nothing about them. But since she thought I would enjoy it I decided to read them.<br /><br />Right away when I started reading it, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get into the book. It seemed like it was going to be too young adult for me with no substance and a lot of teenager slang that I wasn't going to be able to take. But once it started to get more in depth into the House of Night with Zoey going to school there it started to get better. And now, I must admit that I am ready to read the next one.<br /><br />The book just goes into alter reality where vampyres are known about. Heck, some of them are celebrities. I would like to know more about the history of this alter reality, how the vamp became how they are. I was confused at first because it felt like I should have known more before I actually started to read the book. Hopefully in some of the other books that follow it will give more information.<br /><br />The book is about zoey redbird who gets marked to become a vampyre and she must move to the school House of Night in order to live. Because, if you get marked as a vampyre and don't go to the House of Night you die. The house of night is a place to go while you are living through the changing process to become a vampyre. You stay there for four years just like a high school and at the end if you can take the change you become a vampyre.<br /><br />Zoey finds out she is not like all the other fledglings, she has extra powers and her mark is different than everyone elses.<br /><br />After getting past the beginning it is a really good book, and now I am off to read Betrayed, the second book of the series.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|It's been more than two years since HIM's last CD but the wait was well worth it! I love EVERY song on this CD. I've listened to it all the way through more than 20 times! Their music is still the old familiar HIM style but they've definitely added a new edge to it! There are a lot more electronic/synthetic sounds; some extremely reminiscent of music from the '80s. However, if all this electronic stuff is not your thing, get the 2 CD edition. The other CD is the acoustic version of all the songs and they're equally amazing. I LOVE HIM AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM IN CONCERT NEXT MONTH!
1416972242|5.0|City of Ashes, was just as good as the first one. Although, I felt there were some discrepancies with time in the book and with things happening. I don't have any on the top of my head but I remember reading it and thinking that doesn't seem right.<br /><br />Throughout the whole book there is the elephant in the room. Which was Jace and Clary being brother and sister. Throughout the whole book it is told that they didn't like how they were siblings because they wanted to be more intimate. At the same time, Simon wants to be with Clary and Maia wants to be with Simon and Alec wants to be with Jace it is like a love pentagon?<br /><br />Spoiler warning...<br /><br />There was a point in the book where the inquisitor looks at Jace and has a look in her face that seems to say maybe Jace isn't Valentines son but really Jace Wayland? But we will never know because the Inquisitor dies right then! I really want him to not be Valentines son, so Jace and Clary can be together. Tons of times someone is in the middle of saying something really important and then gets cut off and I am like come on! What was he going to say!<br /><br />I hope some things get resolved more like how Simon can now be in the sun. Is it Jaces blood that lets him? Is it because Jace gave it to him voluntarily? Also, is Jace really Valentines son because tons of time it says Jace doesn't look like Valentine and most of the time Valentines says you carry my blood. But in a way, Simon carries Jaces blood now too, does that mean they are related? Did Valentine infuse him with his blood to be better? But he is isn't really his father? I have so many questions. I hope City of Glass answers some of them. I am a couple pages into it so far. Hopefully they can get Clary's mom to wake up so she can clarify some stuff too!
0545123267|3.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy reading Shiver as much as a I did.  This novel is as much atmospheric as anything; Stiefvater creates the cold, winter landscape beautifully and I loved the sparse prose.  There has been a lot of controversy around this book, though I'm not sure why.  I'm sure those who love Twilight, will love Shiver. Maybe they'll even appreciate the more skilled writing and beautiful language, which is why I bought this book for my sister for Christmas.  The biggest complaints seem to be Grace's lack of independence and a couple mentions of Grace's parents.  It is really convenient that Grace's parents are never around, but at least Stiefvater attempts to weave this into the story with Grace's frustration with her parents absence.  After reading the complaints about Grace, I was very prepared to feel the same way, but I was surprised.  I thought Grace was very independent, not perfect, but sometimes I want to read a novel about an all-consuming passionate love.  Okay?  All in all, I thought Shiver was decent, if not perfect.  The plot could have used some cleaning up, the conflict was kind of boring to me.  But I know my sister (14) will love it, so that's all that really matters.
1416955070|5.0|I just finished the book Mortal Instruments City of Bones. I really like the book a lot. There was a twist at the end that surprised me and I was hoping it wasn't true! But it was. The only thing I didn't really like about this book was the ending. Jace & Clary confront the bad guy, and that part lagged, it went on and on and I was like just do something already!<br /><br />The book is about a 15 year old name Clary who happens to go into an all age club and follows a demon to three shadowhunters. After that, Clary's life changes. She is no longer the mundane she thought she was and finds out she is more like these shadowhunters then she ever wanted to be. She finds out her whole life has been a lie and her mom didn't tell her what she really was.<br /><br />When her mom goes missing she teams up with the shadowhunters to find her mom. But not just the shadowhunters are helping, her friend Simon that she known all her life, who is a simple mundane (human) helps out as well. I really like the characters Simon and Jace.<br /><br />I really like the twist and turns of the book. And now I just started the second book in the series and so far it is good as well.

0679731369|2.0|Flaubert's Parrot is a novel, but I will concern myself with its nonfictional aspects, for I'm afraid that this book has had greater popular appeal than any full-length biography of Flaubert. And for those who may take Barnes' book as a primary source for understanding the life of Flaubert, I give a warning. Barnes throws doubt on the possibility of any person truly knowing another,this being perhaps the deepest message of his book. But Barnes, in this process, obscures an aspect of Flaubert that towers above any other: that Flaubert was a priest of a cult of literature like few have been since and like no one before him.    Barnes is never categorical. He is witty, trivial, irreverent, and suggestive. But he does make a case against the image of Flaubert as the hermit of Croisset, hidden from the world, inaccessible in his study as he pored over books and manuscripts. Flaubert saw friends frequently. He traveled widely. In 1856, he took an apartment in Paris and enjoyed the social life of some of the highest nobility and of the most famous literary personages of the day. Barnes also makes a case for Flaubert being a more passionate and sensual man than had hitherto been believed.  But Flaubert's intense friendships were all extremely literary, and his travels were above all for literary inspiration. He was a sensuous man but his only long-lasting affair, with Louise Colette, shows a man devoted to books, not women. When Louise dared to do the forbidden--come to Flaubert's home at Croisset--he turned her out without hesitation into the pouring rain, and thus the affair ended.     Milton, Dante, Virgil all felt their poetry required divine inspiration, long years of preparation in study, long years of work to polish each line, to reconsider each phrase. But no one, before Flaubert, felt that prose fiction was worthy of such devotion. Flaubert spent six to seven years writing each of his novels, and these were years of long, daily work. The 300 pages of Madame Bovarywere refined down from 4000 pages of notes and revisions. Flaubert read 1500 books and pamphlets in order to write Bouvard and Pecuchet, where he ridicules pompous erudition. Since Flaubert, we have had such worshipers of this cult as Henry James, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and Franz Kafka. For all of these writers, Flaubert was an inspiration.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book is unlike most business books, both in its brevity and message. Many of the ideas are common sense, but a lot of the business books out there, especially when it comes to startups, stray pretty far from the tenets advocated here. Notable ones include:<br /><br /> - Don't take outside investment<br /> - Don't try to grow indefinitely<br /> - Don't always listen to your customers<br /> - Scratch your own itch<br /><br />Recently, I've read a lot of business books focused at starting a small business, but this is the first one that really strives to keep you honest, not just feed you hype. Business books, schools and people themselves like to over-complicate business and I'm planning to keep Rework on my desk as a reality check for myself and my business.<br /><br />I also truly appreciate the brevity. Way too many business (and technical) books are padded with reiteration of a few key points just to get to a respectable page count. Jason and David respect our time enough to keep it short and to the point. If you need reiteration, read it again; I know that's what I plan on doing!

Having said that if you are even the most casual fan of Chapman out there I that think you will be pleased with this effort.  Although, at this stage in Chapman's career, her lyrics focus more on relationships than politics than in times past however her lyrics continues to be though provoking and moving.

1567184855|5.0|Have you ever wondered what really happens after we die?  Is there truly an afterlife?  Is there such a thing as reincarnation?  This fascinating book by author Michael Newton investigates these questions and more.  Using hypnosis to bring his subjects into a super-conscious state, he regresses them to a time before their present lives, a time when they were in spirit form.<br /><br />Made possible by these numerous hypnosis/regression sessions Mr. Newton has recorded over his many years of experience as a therapist, we are able to glimpse the world beyond the veil of death, an orderly world where we all exist eternally, without physical bodies, and with complete and absolute acceptance of and love for ourselves and each other.  We are able to glimpse what happens \\"between lives.\\"<br /><br />These subjects are able to describe in detail what the experience of both death and life after death are like.  We come from a spirit plane to which we return after death.  When we return, we are greeted with love by the members of our \\"soul group,\\" \\"clusters\\" of souls who spend eternity together, learning with and supporting each other both in the spirit world and on Earth.  Have you ever met someone you're immediately comfortable with, someone who seems familiar in some way?  He or she is probably a kindred soul, an individual from your soul group who has come to Earth with you so you may both bring about growth for your souls on \\"Earth school.\\"<br /><br />Earth is a place of opposites and extremes, where beings of love come to experience conflicting sensations and emotions.  The dark/light, hate/love, pain/joy, loss/victory of the Earth plane give our souls a vehicle for experiencing opposites, which in turn gives us a greater appreciation of the absolute joy and love of the plane we come from.  The light of the candle cannot know itself without the darkness to surround it.<br /><br />Of course, it would be impossible to definitively verify the subjects' encounters with the spirit world, but these cases demonstrate a consistency from person to person that speaks to the validity of their experiences.  These subjects describe an orderly world overseen by a loving \\"over-soul,\\" whom we are always aspiring to rejoin.  This book will provide hope for the afterlife and establish a whole new way of looking at death, a way without fear or worry.  With this knowledge, it is possible to alleviate some of the fear, fear of the unknown and fear of retribution, that some have about death.  Made obvious is the fact that after this present journey, we will return to a world of love.demonstrate a consistency from person to person that speaks to the validity of their experiences.

B002UZXJA6|5.0|I think I have all the CW programs and this is the best one yet!  The new girls, Lynn and Alex are a good fit and add a lot to the show.  I like the dramatic numbers and the group numbers are really great.  More movement and more expression adds much to the performances.  As soloists, they are obviously well accomplished, but the ensemble numbers are where they really shine.  I can't get enough of it.  I don't know if DVDs and CDs wear out, but I'm picking up a couple of spares just in case.  I highly recommend this to fans of CW and you will love this one, too.  I nice touch is the \\"Making of\\" included on the DVD.  Performing and recording outdoors in Ireland is certainly filled with adventure.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Zoey Deschanel is perfectly cast in this movie as the sort of woman who walks all over a man without him actually realizing what has happened to him, because she does it with a smile on her face and lots of charm. Throughout the movie, it is kind of unclear actually as to what it is about Summer as a person that Tom, such a sensitive, funny, and smart guy, finds enticing and falls for. Besides looking cute, Summer is not particularly fun or funny, charming, kind or generous. She is aloof, cold, distanced, has no sense of humor and is kind of insincere actually. She has Tom wrapped around her little finger, leads him on and treats him like crap. Maybe her constant withholding and elusive charm is what he is attracted to?  He sure wouldnt be the first because he keeps pursuing her and goes back for more. In its essence, this movie is a story about a man loving a woman who doesnt love him back. Summer, of course, blames life and the nature of relationships for her behavior, but we all know that these are just the standard, run of the mill excuses one hears from people who dont love you.     They say that the power of a relationship lies with whoever cares less. No movie exemplifies this more than this one. Summer is the one who cares less and so she clearly holds the power in this relationship, which she unkindly uses.     500 days of summer is a charming, intelligent love story that arrives at common wisdom regarding love and relationships in an unconventional way. It is beautifully photographed, with believable characters, engaging dialogs and great soundtrack.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Mystic River DVD Review<br />2 Disc Widescreen Edition (2003)<br /><br />Mystic River cleaned up and won Academy awards for Best Actor - Sean Penn, and Best Supporting Actor - Tim Robbins and was nominated for everything else you can think of. It did not, however win Best Picture. Directed by Clint Eastwood from the novel written by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is about three childhood friends who after a tragic incident grow up to be a cop, a victim, and a suspect.<br /><br />This movie can feel very slow in the pacing and action. It takes a while for events to pick up and characters to start opening up. The feel of the movie and accuracy helps set the location very well. Everything is dark and in blues like the river. The ensemble cast is a big who's who of a generation in Hollywood. Since Clint Eastwood prefers to get everything done in one or two shots, you know actors had to step up their game and that makes the performances a little more impressive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Tim Robbins, mostly because of The Shawshank Redemption. He just always finds a way to look so.......haunted. He plays a quiet, kinda crazy guy who was sexually abused as child when he was kidnapped and held prisoner in a cellar for four days. Now he's grown with a wife and child and comes home at 3 a.m. one night with blood on his hands. His facial expressions and tone of voice are so eerie. His character is a pathological liar because the time he told the truth when his friends lied, he was made into a victim. Now in any threatening situation, he lies to stay safe and it makes him even more of a suspect.<br /><br />Sean Penn's daughter played by Emmy Rossum (who is beautiful and innocent as always, this was her first notable role in a big film) is found to have been murdered. Penn does a heart-breaking job screaming over and over again, \\"Is that my daughter in there?\\" Honestly, he gets it in about ten times and has to be restrained by like seven guys to avoid going to see her body where they found it. He brings out the raw emotion at the drop of a hat and his performance is very compelling.<br /><br />Their other childhood friend, Kevin Bacon is one of the investigating cops along with Laurence Fishburne and they (of course) try to piece together the puzzle and find out what happened. There's a side mystery of his silent wife who calls him and says nothing which is sad but unessential to the core of the film. Bacon walking the line between victim's parent and suspect being his childhood friends is quite the feat. While they are not close any longer, under every conversation is a vast canyon of history that is addressed in subtext.<br /><br />Marcia Gay Harden plays Tim Robbins's wife and stays in the background looking worried and scared most of the movie. Laura Linney plays a great grieving stepmother and makes a big character turn that comes out of left field at the end of the movie. To avoid any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, the movie really could have ended after the main action when Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon were talking in the street. But no, it continues to show more aftermath conversations and a parade. I guess it is to set up the audience choosing in their minds what happened to the characters later, but it's really so ambiguous it feels like overkill. The comparison of marital relationships from which is most loving to which is most likely to last is interestingly ironic.<br /><br />This movie is good....but it just isn't THAT good. It has some beautiful individual performances but as a package, loses my interest at points. I guess the Academy and I have different standards......then again, it didn't win Best Picture now did it?<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />There are two featurettes, \\"Beneath the Surface\\" and \\"From Page to Screen\\" that go over the casting of the movie, production details, Eastwood's one-take style of directing, and the accuracies of where they shot the movie. The writer points out that they started shooting about a block and half away from where he wrote the book. Also the writer was very concerned that all these Hollywood actors would sound different than how he heard his characters in his head, but that they mastered their accents and characters well to his imagination. There are full-length interviews from \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\" that into detail with Clint Eastwood, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins. No Sean Penn? The part of the extras I enjoyed the most was commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. I always enjoy actor commentary the most since I have a background in acting in theatre and film myself. They break down some of the scenes and reveal a little more about motivations for why certain things were done and are just interesting to listen to if you are fans of their work. This edition also includes a complete CD soundtrack which I did not have the pleasure of checking out because the copy I had was from the library and didn't include it.

B0000640VO|5.0|One of the best movies! Awesome story, great acting, great actors. Cinematography A+, If you don't like this movie, something is wrong with you. I'm sorry, but that's just the truth.
0307341569|4.0|Many reviews here have described the story so I will not. What I will add to the other reviews is that the story is unlike anything I have read before, and I read A LOT of books. I could not put it down. The way the story is told grabbed me because of how it goes back and forth in time. The story is a very good mystery, or whodunit? The characters are sad and pathetic, but believable. The Kill Club aspect of the story is not important but serves as a catalyst for what happens with the main character. I was satisfied with the ending, which was a good one and totally unexpected.
B0015519VS|5.0|I think this album is excellent...IS THIS HIS BEST, no...he has moRe to come, but this album is just as good. i think it's for more of a mature vibe, keeping it with the audience of today. i think this album as with any artist is dealing with the time of an artist life and the whole album signifies that, I think if you don't get it you will rate low, because Ummm--->you don't get it..Usher can't throw out the same kind-of album every-time, if anything this album shows his growth and as a fan I WELCOME THAT.

B002WYH5N2|4.0|I quite enjoyed this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice.  It keeps much of the main plot & key points from the novel & sprinkles in a few more overly romantic scenes.  Only necessary to make the story seem more romantic for the majority of the populace who are not familiar with the decorum of the 19th century.<br /><br />While Keira Knightly looks the part of Elizabeth, something in her performance niggles at me & I'm just not convinced with her.  However, I'm very satisfied with the rest of the cast, most of all Mr. Darcy.  In fact, it's Matthew Macfadyen's performance that just pulled me into this movie.  I actually makes me wish, in this case, the story was told from his POV & not Elizabeth's.<br /><br />There are several instances where we have these \\"introspective\\" moments with Elizabeth's character, but as we don't hear any narration or speaking on screen, just music, we're left in the dark on what exactly she's thinking.  We have an idea, since we know what is going on in the story, but really we can only speculate.  Some of these are fine in places, but others just seem a bit pointless & could have been left out.  Especially if the time could have been used to keep in any left out portions of the book.<br /><br />I do love the original story & while this movie isn't the truest version it certainly looks beautiful & has a pretty solid cast.  Some folks may find the movie slow or boring, but not every movie needs explosions to be good.  No, I'd say most anyone who is a fan of the novel or is curious as to what they may find within it's pages will be pleased with this movie.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I bought this album because of the 7.1 DD Surround sound, there are not so many BluRay discs with 7.1.  I was really surprised, I know Chris Botti not that good, but I heard some tracks from him,so thats why I bought this.  Its like if you are in the concerthall, really phenomenal.
0307387151|5.0|I feel that I cannot do a review of Atonement justice, Ian McEwan's writing is so sublime that any articulation I can give it necessarily misrepresents this superb book. But I must press forward regardless.<br /><br />Atonement is quite nearly a perfect book to my tastes; tragic, cynical and ultimately profound and deeply meaningful, few other literary masterpieces can match it in capturing me at every level.<br /><br />Ian's mastery of language comes through in every sentence and only Jane Austin and--perhaps controversially--G.K. Chesterton can match it. It is crisp, varied and sophisticated, yet never is it overly verbose and is always in service of the story.<br /><br />But the accomplishment of style and composition is by no measure the sole attribute to be praised. Rather, it is the characters so vividly painted, unique but never so exceptional that I stopped believing or caring in them and the unfolding tragedy that sets in at the end of the first act that demands my emotional engagement.<br /><br />Fair warning, while I will not spoil any specifics but reading further will expose tone and generalities about the book.<br /><br />I believe what sets Atonement apart from peers is that this is a story about; not quite altruistic, but certainly good natured people with mostly benevolent intentions making mistakes that have dire consequences for each other and the pursuit of Atonement is never fully attainable. We are asked to consider innocence, fancy, self-deception and truth from angles we rarely examine. As the story commences we loath Briony's actions while simultaneously sympathizing and admiring her imagination and integrity, just as we feel her sadness as she comes to terms with her crime.<br /><br />In the end, I believe that Atonement does what few other stories do, it does not opt for the ease of a happy ending, but neither does it leave us with bleak despair. This is not a story of forgiveness; a crime has been committed that cannot be forgotten and while Briony seeks--and finds--a measure of atonement it is not cheap, nor is it complete. No, a fairy tale ending is not to be found, it is rather, torn away from us and in this it managed to penetrate my cynicism affect me profoundly.<br /><br />While I would leave you with that I do want to add one final note that should not be read if you are not already familiar with the story. Having seen the recent film I was afraid that knowing the end would make the book less evocative for me and I am quite happy to say that while the ending did not leave me stunned on my second experience it was no less meaningful. If you too have also only seen the film then I assure you reading the book will enrich your appreciation even further.ent it is not cheap, nor is it complete.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|This is an absolutely stunning effort on the part of Alice in Chains. William DuVall lends the vocal harmonies that are essential to the Alice sound without trying to be Layne Staley. Last of My Kind is the stand out track on this album for me, it really showcases DuVall's talent as a vocalist. All the tracks on this album are solid, you won't find filler here. And the title track, Black Gives Way to Blue, is a very beautiful tribute to Layne. If you have doubts just go out and buy this album, you won't be disappointed.

It works great, very accurate and is compatible with Streets&Trips.  It also is magnetic, so it sticks to the dashboard, instead of sliding around all the time.  Love it!
0316017922|5.0|gladwell destroys the concept of inherent abilities. as a black man this is important because we have been told for 400 years that we are genetically inferior in intelligence. Gladwell's study indicates that the intelligence factor plays far less a role than many other factors such as time spent on a skill, education, and one's cultural environment. his work is going to have a tremendous effect on the education of children. it will also lead many parents to place more emphasis on intervening in their children's development, especially in having them learn special skills at an early age. we know that tiger woods began playing golf as a toddler. parents will begin taking this concept more seriously than before. black parents will also begin to understand the relationship of culture to their worldview and resultant behavior, especially what they are teaching their children on a subliminal level. it is very critical reading for those of us who live in the black communities of america. this book will spawn tremendous activity and research.many more books will be written because of it.

0425220931|3.0|The first, less mystical half, of the book is a lot more interesting and valuable than the second. Once Wooten gets into his magical, mystical, imaginary musical instructor, Michael, he gets carried away with the magic and the story becomes more like Harry Potter than music lesson. I will take some of the lessons from the first half with me for the rest of my musical life. I hope I can forget the 2nd half as soon as possible.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Dating all the way back to 2001's \\"Lifesblood\\" EP, and on through subsequent full-length releases -- 2002's steamrolling \\"Remission,\\" 2004's beastly \\"Leviathan,\\" and Ought-Six's commercial breakthrough \\"Blood Mountain\\" -- Mastodon have proven to be one of the most consistent metal bands around. They are simply not capable of making bad (or even mediocre) music, and it has gotten to the point where a great album by them is matter-of-factly. Furthermore, one might even venture to say that this Georgia-based quartet are among the top five reasons why it's good to be alive in recent years. Unfortunately, with such high achievements come equally-as-high expectations. Fans everywhere have to wonder one thing: On 2009's \\"Crack the Skye,\\" can they match -- or possibly even surpass -- the excellence they captured on previous releases (especially on \\"Blood Mountain,\\" which was not only a major-label debut, but also received high praised from fans and critics alike)?<br /><br />Absolutely! \\"Blood Mountain\\" and \\"Crack the Skye\\" are similar releases in that they both leave a big smile on the face of whoever hears it. That said, let it be known that the latter of the two has many unique attributes that make it the group's most ambitious and progressive work to date! Yes, its production job may sound extra-polished, but the real ground broken here comes courtesy of brilliant songwriting. First of all, only seven tracks are presented this time around, and only one of them (#2) is less-than five-minutes in length, and two of them (numbers four and seven) reach well-past the ten-minute mark. Next, virtually all unnecessary changes in direction and tempo have now been scrapped, making the songs much more hooky and cohesive. As a result, no matter how good that aforementioned 2006 effort was, this one marks a definite step forward from it in terms of memorable guitar parts and contagious grooves.<br /><br />And lastly, in a move not unlike what Gojira made on \\"The Link\\" in 2003 (and also similar to, say, Black Sabbath's \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\\" Down's \\"Over the Under,\\" and Jesu's \\"Conqueror\\"), Mastodon opted to make these new songs substantially more progressive and psychedelic and less brutal and viscerally satisfying than anything heard before. Indeed, unlike anything heard before, these songs possess a certain concerted level of tunefulness. This is in a large part due to a large increase in the use of melodic vocals. Sure, frontman Troy Sanders' unique, throaty growl remains as strong as ever, but it is now most of the time put on the back burner in favor of surprisingly accomplished proper singing. But fear not, because Mastodon's core sound - ginormous, rampaging grooves, beefy, inexorable rhythms, great, Sabbath-y, pure doom riffing, powerful and booming bass lines, and really energetic and technical drumming -- remain firmly in tact here. Hence, the new material sure doesn't skimp on heaviness. All of this considered, \\"Crack the Skye\\" is definitely a smashing success, the sound of a band at the top of their game, and, in this reviewer's opinion, the winner for the year's absolute finest piece of heavy music.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" begins on a momentous and thunderous doom-laden note before kicking things into high gear with a stream of propulsive, buzzsaw riffs, bullying grooves, and pounding skins. It eventually transitions into soaring melodic choruses with infectious clean singing, and a batch of blistering guitar solos caps it all off. \\"Divinations\\" quickly follows-up a funky, banjo-plucked intro with thunderous, and near drum-roll-esque drumming, hard-hitting guitars, and big, fat, chugging rhythms. An excellent, wailing solo crops up here, too. Next up, \\"Quintessence\\" has the record's most basic and predictable song structure, making it probably the simplest song you will find here. But that doesn't mean it's bad by any means! It skilfully trades off harmonic twin guitar leads, and Brann Dailor's deft, up-tempo, and jazzy drumming,with heavy, guitar-driven segments (i.e. crunchy, rollicking, Sabbath/Wolfmother-like, hard rock-flavored guitar leads, a distorted bass bottom, and lumbering rhythms) and occasional dreamy acoustic breaks. And in a final unexpected twist, Sandoval tosses in some cool robotic vocals to end. Track four, \\"The Czar,\\" is nearly eleven minutes long, and is broken up into four parts: \\"Usurper,\\" \\"Escape,\\" \\"Martyr,\\" and \\"Spiral.\\" And even though it is one epically epic and indisputably multi-faceted number, it could not flow more seamlessly from one part to another. Nice, lightly-picked guitar melodies looming overhead a relaxed, crashing drum beat making it initially rather tranquil and ambient. However, Mastodon's patented heaviness lurks just around the corner: a rip-roaring groove, fiery, thrashy guitars and fast, flowing bass lines storm onto the scene around four-minutes in, greeting the listener like a kick to the noggin.  And then, sans for an unexpected melodic breakdown around 6:50, and a subsequent unorthodox guitar solo section, the remainder of the tune plays like an Alice in Chains cover.<br /><br />Then comes my personal favorite, \\"Ghost of Karelia,\\" which is highlighted by amazing crescendo. It builds from a grungy-sounding bass intro into towering climax composed of excellent, carefully-calculated sludge riffage, dense, churning rhythms, tight and precise drumming (including ample punishing double bass work), and strong bass lines that grumble from below. An effective bit of crooning is tossed into the mix, and it works as a very nice contrast to the heavy music. But unlike most songs on \\"Crack the Skye,\\" in \\"Ghost of Karelia,\\" Sanders primarily focuses on using the same harsh, guttural style that he used on earlier material. The result is another chorus that is guaranteed to rattle around your head for quite some time. Plus, his dissonant snarls of lines like \\"holding skulls\\" and \\"bulls' bloodshot eyes\\" are also really cool and get tattooed to your brain after just one listen. Although the vocal melody in the title track is not one of Mastodon's strongest, it is made-up for with ample heavy, doomy, chug and churn guitar licks, and thick, crunching rhythms that evoke vintage High on Fire, as well as a few blazing solos and well-placed harmonies. Finally, set closer, \\"The Last Baron,\\" marries brisk, Slayer-esque riffs, pummeling rhythms, and a Crowbar-by-way-of-Neurosis-style groove with several \\"math-y\\" tempo changes, some proggy fretboard noodling, and even a few keyboard flourishes.<br /><br />In brief, this is yet another excellent instalment in Mastodon's already amazing (and nearly untouchable) discography. But hey, what were you expecting? They have already established themselves as a truly great band, and one of the most preeminent metal acts of the 21st Century. And as long as they keep knocking masterpieces out of the park like this, the \\"Skye\\" is the limit.with heavy, guitar-driven segments (i.e. crunchy, rollicking, Sabbath/Wolfmother-like, hard rock-flavored guitar leads, a distorted bass bottom, and lumbering rhythms) and occasional dreamy acoustic breaks.

Hendrix really gets some great tones here, it is a very well mastered CD also. I think that it is well worth releasing. As much stuff as The Grateful Dead release, This very well worth the release, considering how popular this man was.<br />  This is the type of recording that a guitarist or a guitarist fan would really like. Yeh, it's a shame with all of the different versions of it, but still, it is what it is.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Creo que la mayoria de foristas son muy injustos con el se&ntilde;or Emmerich, el hace un gran esfuerzo y sus peliculas son entretenidas, y casi siempre tienen algun tipo de base cientifica, y sobre todo tratan de dejar una moraleja, la unica pelicula de el que no me gusto para nada  fue 10000 bc mas por sus imprecisiones historicas que por su mal guion, en el caso de 2012 a pesar de no creer personalmente en la profecia si me siento honrado que se haya tomado en cuenta a un pueblo nativo de mis pais, los maya-quiches, y que en una de las escenas de la misma haya salido la ciudad maya de Tikal localizada en el departamento de Peten, de mi bello e incomparable pais. Asi que a pesar de todo creo que la pelicula es buena, tiene buen argumento y maravillosos efectos especiales, le doy 5 estrellas, por otro lado estoy completamente de acuerdo con la persona que se queja de que no hayan agregado subtitulos u opciones de audio en espa&ntilde;ol, por favor despues del ingles el espa&ntilde;ol es el idioma que mas se habla en los Estados Unidos, asi que por que segregarlo???  tristemente aun existe mucha ignorancia, y no se tal vez miedo? a la minoria mas grande de los Estados Unidos, yo no comprare esta pelicula, aunque me gusta mucho, debido a que algun ejecutivo cabeza dura piensa que el espa&ntilde;ol no es un idioma que valga la pena tomarse en cuenta.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|As you watch the movie merge throughout the length of time, and the humans story become part of the AVATAR story you become more focused on the character and shape, that was designed in James Cameron's mind before the film could go into production. It is a absolute visual effect and graphic field that draws you inside a beautiful world called Pandora which you come to love in your own way. The supporting characters have many great roles, which help bring presence in the film. This film aswell as being amazing in 2D, was truly designed and built for watching in 3D, I just can't wait to buy the dvd now or maybe the even the blu-ray version aswell.
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|I like this album very much. Her voice sounds stronger and bolder on this album and I like all the tracks except Teeth.
B002VECM4A|2.0|I found this movie both incredibly derivative and predictable. We have seen this program  over and over and over again, on Oprah, Jerry Springer or on those so-called reality shows (didn't MTV and VH1 used to specialize in music?). Practically every black female author uses a variation of this plot line ad nauseum. This is less \\"exposing\\" reality than misandrist wish-fulfillment, which in its own way perpetuates racism by perpetuating stereotypes. The only difference between this movie (and novel) and a typical Springer show is that being obese, unattractive, uneducated like \\"Precious\\" can not \\"always\\" be explained by being the victim of a rapist father, uncle or brother--or mother. Maybe the inner city environment is to blame, or maybe she has personality defects, or isn't interested in eating properly or the way she looks. Maybe she's bored in school. Maybe she's has violent tendencies herself. Maybe she just doesn't care.
B00005OCMR|4.0|TRON is one of my all time favorite films. This 20th Aniviversary Edition is awesome. It is packed with extras for you folks who, like myself, are into the conceptual/behind the camera element of film making. The image quality is very good, no complaint really. Some film grain is visible but nothing distracting.    The trailer for the upcoming sequel, TRON: Legacy([...]) made me bust out my copy of this 20th aniversary Edition to watch the original again. Popped it into my PS3 and it is upconverting to 1080p beautifully. Since there isn't an HD quality version available *yet* I figured this info might be useful to someone who wanted to pick it up but was waiting for Blu Ray version. Unless they spend lots of time remastering it for HD, I don't think it will get much better. Most of the older films I have picked up on Blu Ray haven't been that much better than an upconverted version of the DVD, only exception I can make is Close Encounters, it looks fantastic.

B002S0OBN2|1.0|What an abomination. Everything that made Lloyd Webber's original musical poignant, lyrical, sad, beautiful, haunting, contemplative, hummable, memorize-able, and most importantly entertaining has been banished without a trace from this rambling hodge-podge attempt at a follow up. Lloyd Webber has violated the respect and trust of Phantom fans in the same way as George Lucas did to fans of the original Star Wars Trilogy when he created the `prequels.' Additionally, Lloyd Webber deletes all thrill of mystery and romance from the show a la Brian Singer in Superman Returns by giving the dubious protagonist a child with the heroine. Son of Phantom, indeed, is what this show should have been called.    Love Never Dies is worse than Universal's cinematic sequel to the Phantom, called the Climax, with Boris Karloff replacing Claude Rains.     What really tears me up is that this show is the grand apotheosis of all that is wrong with musical theatre currently. Love Never Dies takes the worst elements of some of the best and worst shows of the past three decades (including ALW's own) and blends them all together into one horrifying mixture, the musical equivalent of a bad film from the `Scary Movie' franchise, but masquerading as a piece of art. Lyrics are banal and sloppy, reminiscent of the worst in Wicked, while musical themes are ripped indiscriminately from previous ALW works such as Sunset Blvd and Whistle Down the Wind. Even the title song is ostentatiously and admittedly taken from one of ALW's other musicals. Musical 'dialogue' is ripped in tone and content from the weakest moments of Miss Saigon and Les Miserables. Gone are the days of Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita.     In conclusion, Mme Giry's line at the end of Act One perfectly encapsulates everything I feel toward this show: `All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!' We would still have the haunting, untarnished vision of dark beauty that was given to us 23 years ago if this bastard of a showhad never been put to paper. This sequel robs us, the fans, of all innocence and hours of happy contemplation as to the real end of the Phantom in the original show. I hate to say it, but Frederick Forsyth's novel, upon which this abomination was based, is ten times better. What a waste and shame. Next year, with any luck, we'll see Jesus Christ Superstar: The Rapture, or DOGS: The Sequel to Cats, or Hollywood Blvd., or some other travesty pushed out by a once-great artist. I'm sorry, but Love Never Dies is beneath contempt. Very angry, and very sad. The only good thing is that I won't have to waste $200 to tickets to see this in Broadway in L.A, having heard the CD.
0307270807|3.0|\\"Dispatches\\" received such glowing recommendations that my high expectations were disappointed when I finally got around to reading it.  There are, to be sure, excellent passages in this book that seem to capture the surreal, self-deceptive, and hypocritical nature of the Vietnam conflict.  Herr also is able to portray the extremes of bravery, integrity, racism, and viciousness that characterize the front-line \\"grunts.\\"  Often these contradictory characteristics are present in the same individual.    My disappointment comes from Herr's self absorption and from the random, unorganized nature of the various dispatches.  Also, Herr makes frequent, casual reference to his own drug use and that of the GI's.  He does not explain why those in Vietnam fell into substance abuse, nor does he explore the effects of it on outlook and on the war effort.  Perhaps given the pro-drug attitude of the counterculture of the day, he simply seems to assume that such drug use was natural under the circumstances.      Herr does have the capacity for empathy and his portrayal of the extraordinary characters on the front lines makes this a compelling book.

B002RVEDE4|5.0|Leonard Cohen<br />\\"Live At The Isle Of Wight: 1970\\"<br />(Sony Legacy, 2009)<br />----------------------------------------------------<br />A remarkable document of Cohen's fabled appearance at the Isle Of Wight music festival, in which he was asked to perform for a fractious, grouchy, muddy audience, following a Jimi Hendrix blow-out that left the groggy festivalgoers in a dark mood. Facing a crowd that teetered on the verge of riot, Cohen, a little grouchy, exhausted and apprehensive himself, worked his way through his set, stopping to \\"rap\\" with the audience in the hippie lingo of the time.  You can feel him working his magic, literally weaving a spell with his songs, half incantation, half lullaby.  This deluxe edition also comes with a documentary film that provides a frame for the music, telling this little-known story of a moment where Great Britain avoided having an Altamont of its own -- instead, we got a great snapshot of Cohen in his prime, as a king of counterculture poets.  Both the film and the audio have technical flaws, but the whole package is mysterious and sublime.  A nice slice of hippie-era folk music history, and a fine set of music for Cohen fans to pour over and relish.  Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Folk Music)

B0039VHWJ4|1.0|As of today, the list price for this is $82, for one disc. Unless this comes with its own Blu-ray player, it's in the running for most overpriced disc ever. At least it's a better movie than the sequel, which also lists at that price. Is this some producer's hubris, or a return to the hideous days before sell-through when pre-recorded VCR tapes were released at similar prices just for the rental market? I hope it's a misprint but I fear something worse. The one star is for the release - the movie itself is worth much more.
0062513346|5.0|I have been enjoying the writing of Paulo Coelho for only a short time but I have become addicted to his writing. It is so in depth, exploring the deepest spiritual conflicts of the characters. His writing is a refreshing change from popular fiction. In my estimation, it is \\"timeless\\".<br />In this novel Paul wants to see his Angel. He takes his wife Chris along for the journey and discovers that  his search cannot be completed unless he helps her discover and speak to her angel. Their journey and their marriage are both complicated and strengthened when they meet the Valkyries in the desert. The story is a real \\"page turner\\".
B0039W1J0Q|4.0|I resisted purchasing this upon release because of the word-of-mouth surrounding Gabriel's versions of Paul Simon's Boy In The Bubble and Radiohead's Street Spirit. The bad news is, the word-of-mouth was right! Both songs are unlistenable. The great news is, the rest of the record is sad and lovely. Heroes was used to particular great effect in the finale of HBO's Big Love this weekend. I have read others compare these performances to Gabriel's piano/Fripp versions of his own Here Comes The Flood. Those comparisons are accurate. So if you enjoy the quiet, unadorned work in PG's catalog(ex Don't Give Up,) you'll like this very much. I do.
B00026WUBE|3.0|This album is in my opinion one of Dylan's best. Recorded live with the Band, Dylan is singing with strength and conviction like he really means it. I wore the record out and decided to get a 'brilliantly' remastered CD of it. But unlike many modern remasters this sounds to me like it was made from the mix-down tape, not the original, and it has much of the harshness of early CD's made from the 2 track mix-downs that were originally used to produce vinyl records. Also, appears to suffer from dynamic range limiting for vinyl. Still, for the price, it was worth it.
B00361HV02|4.0|Upon first listen of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's latest album, \\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo,\\" the first reaction might very well be that the range of sound is familiar, very much in the same vein as what the band has put out in years past.  The band has its niche, and while they continue to grow and change, overall they've decided to maintain an integrity and consistency with what they want B.R.M.C. to sound like.  This observation isn't a criticism -- it's refreshing to see a good band you can count on to not try to reinvent themselves every time it becomes fashionable to do so.  Fans who love past albums will love this.  Those looking for some good new music will find a unique and exciting listen in \\"Devil's Tattoo.\\"           When people talk or write about the band, the influence of blues music always seems to get undercut, or perhaps just ignored.  The spirit of \\"Howl\\" displayed this blues influence more than the other albums perhaps, but B.R.M.C.'s electric, hard-driven rock has always sounded very blues-based.  On this album that influence is evident from the title track, to \\"Conscience Killer,\\" to \\"River Styx.\\"  Don't misunderstand -- this is not a blues record.  But the influence of blues into what this band does makes for some driving, head-noddin', foot-tappin' rock music that just makes you feel good.  It's an album that arguably gets better on the second and third listen.           It's hard to not sound too over-the-top in praising the band.  In a music era where so much of what is put out for consumption is industrial, unoriginal, and just pretty bland, this band has been a breath of fresh air for this reviewer (pardon the cliche).  But it's true.  There isn't really another band that sounds like them putting out music as consistently as they are.  Yes, in many ways \\"Devil\\" sounds very much like their past records, but it's hard to see why that's a bad thing.  Maybe this isn't new territory for the band, but these songs are new, and that's reason enough to go out and pick this up.  I'm on my third listen for the day, and it sounds better each time.  Can't wait to see them live.
B00275EGWY|3.0|I think it was some time after the 2010 SAG Awards when I first heard   about this movie, which, until then, was basically unheard of by anyone   but the most devoted film buffs and Hollywood insiders.  In fact, it had already been released to DVD by then without too much fanfare.  Curious as to why this film had gotten past my radar and was   obviously getting all these raves, rants, and hype from the Hollywood machine,   yet nobody had really seen it, I went out and rented it from a local redbox vender.   I watched it and was immediately taken with Jeremy Renner's intense and renegade performance,   but outside of that, I also noticed that the film really had nothing to propel it beyond that!  The supporting cast, though some of them had their moments,   were basically forgettable in most of what they did.   The plot was kind of loose and non-exsistent in some places.  It also seemed kind of choppy to me...like a lot of ideas and scenarios  which were explored, some more to fruition than others, and kind of  spliced together around the only REAL SOLID performance, which was Renner's.  I'm not saying this was a BAD movie.....it's JUST OKAY and that's all!  This past weekend when it won for picture of the year, best director, etc.  I was sitting in my chair saying to myself.....Hmmm, oookay!! (-:    Now I think that Jeremy Renner deserved his nomination and I hope to see him  in some other, better written and put together films with actors who  are more of his caliber to play against.  That should be good.
0061537969|5.0|Publishers Weekly calls it sentimental. What's with them?<br /><br />The Art of Racing in the Rain was one of the most remarkable books I've ever read...and I've read a lot. If I had to liken it to another book in print, I'd compare it to Jonathan Livingston Seagull. It had that much of an impact on me.  Because I'm a dog lover?  Because I love a good \\"feeling\\"?<br /><br />This is a singularly brilliant book. I don't believe in giving away the story in a review. Besides, others will do that. I just want to say that the plot moves forward smoothly--no slow-downs or unnecessary wordiness. The downward spiral that Denny experiences (Publishers Weekly's assessment aside) was believable. I once experienced a similar down time. His courage in resolving his problems was inspiring. To get technical, the dialogue was believable, the characters fully developed, the plot engaging, and the lesson profound.  It will appeal to fans of Wayne Dyer, The Secret, Abraham-Hicks, and others of the same ilk.<br /><br />You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't read it.  I'm only sorry I didn't write it. Thank you, Garth Stein, for sharing this amazing story with us.

B001P9EQH8|1.0|I've tried this amp with three headphones now (Etymotic ER4P-27 Ohm, Sennheiser HD-25 II-70 Ohm, and Audio-Technica AD700-32 Ohm), and the only discernible addition it seems to offer is a slight but noticeable hiss.  Perhaps if I had VERY high impedance headphones (300 Ohm +) or a VERY crappy source amp (I'm using an ipod touch) it might improve things, but most us use low impedance headphones, and I find it hard to imagine someone who would buy a cheap source component and then buy a rather uncommon accessory.  Save your money and buy a couple of CDs instead.
B001UJUGZY|5.0|this movie is for real so good ! its not very scary , but i dont think it was supposed to be scary , i think it was supposed to be more of a thriller . it kept me guessing i didnt kno what the outcome was gonna be . overall a reeeaaalllly goood movie !
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD. I didn't get a chance to see it when it was on the big screen and that's why I purchased it. I especially liked the added features. One was about the costumes that had been made for him to wear. That really brought it home for me. My husband wasn't going to watch it but got sucked in and enjoyed it just as much,if not more, than I did! He really enjoyed the music. I found it interesting that they had all of the footage that they did.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|To be honest on my first few listens this CD did not sound good compared to previous Sade work.  However, I gave it a chance, after all, I paid for it.  Well, now I love it.  Give it time.  The music is so mellow at times that you forget to listen to the rich interplay going on with the excellent artists.  But, the guitar, sax, bass, keyboards, and other instruments are still being played by great musicians, and of course, Sade's vocals are unique and have a beauty of their own.      When I first heard Sade (and saw the band live) I loved the music.  That music is here too.  Perhaps not to the previous levels, no \\"Is It A Crime?\\" here. Yet, satisfying. My favorites on this CD are \\"The Moon and the Sky\\", \\"Long Hard Road\\", \\"Bring me Home\\", and \\"Skin\\".       Funny when I listen the the beginning of \\"Long Hard Road\\" I expect one of Bob Dylan's songs to follow, but I can't place it.  Maybe it is \\"One More Cup of Cup of Coffee\\" from the Desire CD?    -- JB
B0000C5RQF|3.0|A marvelous performance of perhaps the greatest opera ever written. Damrau is beyond superb as Queen of the Night. Nobody, but nobody, has ever done it better. It deserves five stars but on my computer I cannot do it.
B003BLE88U|5.0|Awesome Music, and a great deal at Target it is not only available with the two bonus tracks but all Jimi cd's are on sale there for $9.98 and if you buy any two you get a FREE $5 gift-card so it was a no brainer I picked up two copies so I can gift one.
B002HREKCI|5.0|This book hooked me from the very beginning and every time I learned a new \\"reason why\\" I knew I was that much closer to the end and I didn't want it to end! Each of the characters bring something new to the story and each new \\"why\\" helps you put together the pieces to the puzzle. Definitely read this!
B00328G4V6|5.0|Got it in my local Target store in Frisco, Texas today (March 9th) and they also have a deal that when buying any two Jimi cd's you get a free $5 gift card and I should mention they had all his cd's on sale for $9.98, incredible good deal for awesome music I would have purchased regardless a good deal or not.
B000VWOV3O|4.0|I'm a \\"proghead\\" myself and hadn't gotten around to getting into Mahavishnu Orchestra yet. Blasphemy, I know. But then I saw this very affordable box set advertised on Amazon and thought that this just might be a good place to start. Before I bought this, I read reviews of this set from an ardent audiophile, on this very site. And he went to go on and on and on and on about how the packaging was substandard. I don't believe he even mentioned how great these discs sounded or how good the music was. Well, I'm here to tell everyone who's interested in checking out Mahavishnu, this IS a GREAT place to start. Not only do you get the exceptional drumming talents of Billy Cobham at play but you get to hear John Mclaughlin's command of the electric guitar and how, at times, he operates it like a machine gun! If I had to pick a favourite, their 1974 George Martin-produced album, \\"Apocalypse\\" which includes the LSO (London Symphony Orchestra), would be it. This is because of its somewhat quaint yet soothing characteristics. It's hard to describe Mahavishu's overall sound but if you dig long BUT melodic fusion jams, this box set probably has your name written all over it. And the fact that you get their first FIVE albums packaged together for less than $20, you just can't go wrong.
B00000JCOV|4.0|This record was the stepping stone for any early- to mid- 20's Hardcore kid. Jamey Jasta has said in a Lambgoat interview that the Slipknot guys all used to come out to Hatebreed shows and give made love, respect, etc. And the Hatebreed influence shows here. Slipknot took the intimated (there, to be sure, but not *requisite* like today) 0-1-4-3-1-0 chord progressions of late-90's Hardcore and appropriated them for their own interests, inadvertently creating the template for the MOSH craze that reigns over today's Hardcore scene. Slipknot's songwriting on this record is so similar to bands like Throwdown (Haymaker especially) that it becomes impossible to separate this record out from modern Hardcore records. The single string riffing, breakdowns, double bass work... all this is VERY MUCH alive and well in bands like Liferuiner, Recon, and so on. This is not to say that such an influence is a bad thing, or that Hardcore has been perverted by nu-metal tendencies, blah blah. It's simply fact. I'd go so far as to say it was inevitable. Slipknot did something worth repeating. This record has something special, something that transcends, on a visceral level (it doesn't take reflection to see the difference here), the scene in which it was accepted: fat nu-metal kids may culturally define this band, but they do not define this record. Slipknot, with this primordial, unpolished effort, accomplished a true anomaly. They followed all the rules of Hardcore without ever once being a Hardcore band. Such a discrepancy will surely always rob this record of its innovatory status, but then again that's what the best records are for--long conversations about how much these songs were misunderstood.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I was going to buy the Lady GaGa's The Fame Monster(Deluxe)CD .... that is... until I read that it's been sensored.  Needless to say, I'll pass.
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|Pay no attention to the naysayers here.  Having read some of them, it's obvious that many just didn't get it.  Many of the questions they've noted are actually answered in  the film.  Watching this is not (and should not) be a passive experience. While the movie may fly over-the-heads of average viewers, if you are a fan of films like MEMENTO, DARK CITY, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, 12 MONKEYS, etc., you are more likely to enjoy this absolutely absorbing film.  Also, despite what some have stated, this movie is not a copy of the Spanish film TIMECRIMES. Although the video release of TIMECRIMES came earlier, TRIANGLE was in the works years before TIMECRIMES. (Not knocking TC and I'd recommend both films, although TRIANGLE is far superior.)
B00005TQKQ|3.0|Got the product in a timely manner.  Havent actually used it yet.  Shipping charges seemed high.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I wasn't sure what I thought when I first heard of this release. Gabriel added to a Beatles tribute release in the 70's that was mostly orchestral, contributing a reading of Strawberry Fields Forever. But PG's pipes have aged like fine wine since that long ago LP. His voice has a texture these days that I'm sure he wishes he had when he was younger. This characteristic adds a special dimension to songs sung in this type of manner. There's a richness that just wouldn't be there with a singer that didn't have that gravel and scratch in his voice. His choice of songs on this disc benefits from his legendary voice as well. A cover \\"project\\" is the term being thrown about in regards to this release. I tried to put that aside and just listen to the songs. The Power Of The Heart and My Body Is A Cage are instant Gabriel classics, even if he didn't write them. The deluxe edition has a disc of additional songs, and the Kink's Waterloo Sunset makes an appearance. I absolutely love Peter's version here. Pure magic. Scratch My Back is a no-brainer for PG fans like me, but I would even recommend this disc to those with even a passing interest.
B00006WKY9|3.0|I see some people here saying that Roth \\"has nothing on Blackmore\\" etc etc or that he's better than Malmsteen and Van Halen..you've got to be kidding me! Uli Roth is good, but to compare him to Malmsteen and EVH is just plain ignorant and stupid.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|SAVE YOUR MONEY - check it out from your local library - OR do what I wish I had done - SAVE YOUR TIME, TOO!  Don't get me wrong - I LOVE DISASTER MOVIES and I really like several of the actors who appear in this movie.  Appear?  Yes, their presence is too lame to be called ACTING.  I blame the director, the terribly awful dialogue, and a very poor script for producing a time waster of epic proportions.  Cliches are to be expected in this genre of movie but EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS OVERDONE with the possible exception of the special effects which are very badly done considering all that is possible with today's special effects/technology.  To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement.  I am very happy that I checked it out from the library and saved the $16.99 for another DVD with more merit and the prospect of being watched more than once!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved this series.  It was short, but so full of emotion.  And what a hottie!  I enjoyed every minute of it.

0446569895|4.0|If you grew up listening to Black Sabbath as I did you will probably      find this book worthwhile. It's Ozzy the good the bad and the ugly.      For someone many thought to be the devil himself, he certainly has      had an angel watching over him. One thing I enjoyed about this book      is rediscovering some of the music. I had quit listening to Sabbath      after the Sabotage record and hadn't heard the last 2 albums Ozzy did      with Black Sabbath. A pleasant surprise to say the least. It was also      fun to check out old concert footage on Youtube. I even found the       clip of a show Tony Iommi did in his brief stint with Jethro Tull.      Interesting book. Can't wait for the movie!
B002QEXBGS|4.0|The bad? I have seen plenty of transvestites around, but to get them in here is rather overkill - even if it is a French production. I would have preferred a better can-can too at the end - a tad crowded and the dance itself gets lost - better so, because it is a mostly male cast of dancers. I wish they hadnt dressed up Dessey as a Tart most of the time. It kinda gives the impression that one has to be a tart to have a mind of ones own as regards lovers, especially since Euridice was supposed to be ravishing looking - the daughter of Aphrodite. Bad....<br /><br />The Good? Absolutely everything from the conductor (Minkowsky is perhaps at his best here) to all the singers. Although I sort of missed the overture, at the end, with the type of treatment that the operetta gets here, it wasnt too badly missed.<br /><br />My first DVD of this got stolen, and if I was tempted to buy another one paying more than what I did for the first one, you can be assured it is worth it... am reputed to be a miser....
0786868724|5.0|HAVE A LITTLE FAITH is an excellent, excellent book.  Easy to read; profound in content.  It's a little like gold mining - just keeping mining and you will turn up surprising gold nuggets of wisdom, compassion and redemption.  The fact that is a true story makes it even more compelling and inspiritational.  A great book to share with friends and discuss the \\"nuggets\\" you each found.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I loved this movie!  I can't wait to enjoy it at home in 3D.  Man!  LOVED THIS MOVIE!  I saw it 4 times in 3D in the theater.  I will go again too!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|The 40's & 50's torch songs, the 60' & 70's ballads, or now in the 21'st century, the \\"LADY\\" is a must have for any collection. Dinah Washington, or Billie Holliday. The BG's, or Fleetwood Mac, were what went on the turntable, (WHAT IS A TURNTABLE?\\") when all the friends left and it was just the two of us home alone. Into the realm of country, Lady Antebellum steps it up a notch to move your heart, and make you want to put your arms around your honey, and tell her, \\"I need you now.\\"
B001OQCV2E|4.0|2012 was just alright to me. Not nearly as epic as what I was expecting. It actually reminded me of Jurassic Park, but they were running from earthquakes instead of dinosaurs.<br /><br />What did impress me was the subliminal storyline of a modern-day Noah's Arch. I feel like if they had brought more of that to the surface it would have created a real message behind the movie, making it way more interesting. Something we could have taken with us after watching the movie. Something epic. Instead, I won't have remembered even seeing this movie unless someone else mentions it.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|The theatrical cut of this film walked too fine a line between courtroom drama/action mystery and a slasher horror film. Granted, it never went quite far enough to gross me out, but, it came close enough to making me think it was going to .One scene early on almost made me stop watching .Sometimes less is more.    Squeamishness aside, it's a first rate thriller.There are plenty of mysteries to unravel as the \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" enacts his revenge.Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler turn in credible performances.In the hands of a lesser cast ,this script might have gone straight to video.  Recommended with reservations
B003204MQS|3.0|Okay, they should have gotten out of the house way before they did, but all in all it was a movie that was kind of creepy and made you jump a few times. I recommend it knowing it is a low budget thriller, no better or worse than lots of other high budget \\"scary\\" movies. I enjoyed it and actually thought about it afterwards which most movies I don't. It seems it is one that you will love or hate. I loved \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" If you didn't like it, you probably won't like this. Considering it was made on an $11,000 budget, not bad at all. Worth a rental.
B000TGJ80S|3.0|While I agree with people that say it is a technically good film I would add that it is still one of the worst adaptations of the story.  Saying that it is more \\"James V. Heart's Dracula\\" than \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is very true.  I agree that Coppola does an awesome job with the film and the acting is poor for the most part though the visuals make up for it.  The truly disheartening part of it is how by changing it so much into a Tragic Love Story it devalues all of the characters.  Mina's good, Dracula's evil, all the various characters that come to love her in platonic ways (or not so), and the personal growth it causes everyone.  The impacts of the deaths are also left with a more of a throwaway feel in the movie because of this.    While this devalued the movie for me that shouldn't take away that this is a good film on it merits.  I was a super fan when it came out until I read the original book because it is a beautifully done film.  If you go in wanting a Tragic Love Story with a great visual feel rather than an adaptation of the book then you will be fine.  If you want a good (note I'm saying good not accurate) adaptation of the book look else where.  If you can get it cheap and you like to buy these types of films then buy it, but it isn't worth it otherwise.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|When I first visited Tokyo, Japan, one of the stories that intrigued me before my trip was the story of Hachiko, a dog who would wait outside Shibuya Station back in the 1930's.  [Note: Although the story is quite popular and well-known for those who gone to Japan, I won't spoil the details of the actual tale].<br /><br />The story of Hachiko touched producer Vicki Shikeguni Wong during her trip to Tokyo and inspired to make a film titled \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" based on the true Japanese story for American audiences.  Directed by Oscar-nominated director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (\\"Chocolat\\", \\"Cider House Rules\\", \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\") and a screenplay by Stephen P. Lindsey (\\"When they Could Fly\\", \\"The Secret of Fireflies\\"), the film would feature cinematography by Ron Fortunato (\\"Gossip Girl\\", \\"Catch a Fire\\", \\"Brotherhood\\") and music composed by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek (\\"Get Low\\", \\"Horsemen\\", \\"Unfaithful\\").<br /><br />The film revolves around college professor Parker Wilson (played by Richard Gere, \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Chicago\\", \\"Unfaithful\\", \\"Primal Fear\\") who was coming home from a trip and a small Akita who was accidentally left behind walks up to Parker who then takes the dog back home.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his wife Cate (played by Joan Allen, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" films, \\"Face/Off\\", \\"The Contender\\") is not thrilled to see a dog in the house, even when their daughter Andy (played by Sarah Roemer, \\"Disturbia\\", \\"Fired Up!\\", \\"The Grudge\\") pleads with the mother to keep it.<br /><br />Parker then learns from his friend Ken (played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, \\"The Art of War\\", \\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\") that the dog's name is \\"Hachi\\" and is an Akita that were popular in feudal Japan. But as Parker tries to find its owner and tries to give the dog away, he finds himself loving the dog and Cate just notices how he is really loving his company with the dog and thus, allows him to keep it.<br /><br />Fast forward year(s) later and Hachi is a grown dog who is loyal to his owner.  He goes home when Parker tells him to and when he hears the incoming train whistling, Hachi knows that his master is coming home and runs to the station and greets him near the station exit.  Among the people who are familiar with Hachi's routine is Carl (played by Jason Alexander, \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Seinfeld\\") who works at the station, Jess (played by Erick Avari, \\"Heroes\\", \\"Dragnet\\") who runs a hot dog concessions stand outside of the station and often gives food to Hachi and a few other business owners around the area.<br /><br />And throughout the seasons, Hachi has repeated his routine of waiting for his master through warm and cold, heavy snow days and has always been loyal to Parker by waiting for him when he returns to the station.  But one day, Parker has a stroke and for Hachi, his loyal dog continues to wait for him.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray as it manages to capture the seasons as Hachi waits for his master.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail from the fur of Hachi to detail on Parker's wool suits.  Skin tones are natural and again, the detail from the various seasons of trees with leaves and without, snowy conditions, everything looks beautiful in this film. Interesting use of muted colors when the film shifts to Hachi's perspective, as the filmmaker tries to show things through Hachi's eyes.  Overall, very good picture quality for this film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" is features an English 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless audio track.  The majority of the film is dialogue driven and thus front and center channel driven but there are a few moments in the film such as a cold windstorm in which you hear rickety noises and wood and object clanging in the background that utilizes the surround channels.  Also, scenes that feature the train running through the train tracks by Hachi is also captured quite well through the surround channels.  Overall, a satisfactory lossless soundtrack for this type of film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English and English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Hachi\\" comes with the following special features in High Definition with English Stereo:<br /><br />  * A Bondy of Loyalty - The Making of Hachi: A Dog's Tale - (17:50) A featurette on the making of the film.  Interviews with the talents and why Richard Gere took the role, working with the dogs that played Hachi and more.<br />  * Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment trailers<br />  * BD-Live Enabled<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Hachi\\" definitely caught my attention when I first saw the trailer.  I've always been interested in the story of Hachiko and it was definitely one of my priorities during my first trip to Tokyo and wanting to see the actual bronze statue of the dog.  Needless to say, when I first heard an American adaptation to the Hachiko tale, especially when there was the film\\"Hachiko Monogatari\\" in 1987 which was a very good film, I was not sure what to expect from \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\".<br /><br />But after watching the film, I was very touched and I have to say that they captured that bond between an owner and a dog, the love for a dog by its owner and most of all, that touching loyalty of the original Hachiko story in this film.<br /><br />It's quite interesting to see Richard Gere in such a film, because you don't expect him in this type of film.  You expect him to take on romantic lead roles or authoritative figures but to see him as a dog lover/owner definitely shows a new light for him as an actor and also, I found it quite intriguing to see the reunion of Gere and Jason Alexander since their pairing back in the 1990 film \\"Pretty Woman\\".  But the film also features star talents such as Joan Allen, Erick Avari, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and you have a talented director with Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.  But more surprising to me that Sony gave this film a very limited release despite having a well-known director and talent behind the film and pretty much made \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" a direct-to-video release.  I wish they would have given this film a chance because it's a very good film with a solid performance by Richard Gere especially with his interaction with Hachi (you're not going to see many films with Richard Gere with a tennis ball in his mouth, while trying to teach a dog how to play fetch).<br /><br />Granted, when it comes to canine films especially with a well-known story about Hachiko the dog, I can understand if people are hesitant after seeing tearjerkers such as \\"Quill\\" or even \\"Marley & Me\\".  It's a very touching film and pays its respect quite well to the original Japanese story based on the real story about Professor Hidesaburo Ueno and his Akita, Hachiko.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" is an enjoyable and touching film that will make you laugh and cry and a film definitely worth watching!this type of film.

B00003CXD0|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time, I was visitng my brother in Syracuse, NY. Everytime \\"Syracuse\\" was mentioned in the film, the audience went nuts. Anyway, it's a funny film with great memories for me.  It was as funny for me today as it was when it first came out.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|In 2006, Japanese fans and anime fans of \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" received exciting news that in the Summer of 2007, the first of four Evangelion films based on the anime television series would be released in theaters.  According to news reports, Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno watched the series from beginning to end and wanted to fix up a lot of questions and debates that fans had over the television series and most importantly, incorporate today's new CG technology for the film versions.  Even furthering the excitement is that the original crew and cast have signed on to work on the new film.<br /><br />So, with mass promotion in Japan, \\"Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" became the #1 film in Japan making over $14.6 million (US), surpassing \\"The End of Evangelion\\" which brought in $14.5 million (US).  A limited edition DVD was released in Japan in 2008 which came with a script, music videos and an \\"Explanation of Evangelion\\" feature and needless to say, fans paid dearly for this limited edition DVD release (only 300,000 were made).  A Blu-ray and DVD release titled \\"Evangelion 1.11' which included a re-transfer of the film plus three additional minutes was released in May 2009 and is currently the best selling Blu-ray release in Japan and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of \\"Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" has been released in the US.<br /><br />With many Americans waiting for \\"Evangelion 1.11' Blu-ray release, suffice to say, the film was released with a very short run at limited theaters and made over $100,000 and was screened at the anime convention Anime Expo in 2009 with great fanfare.<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" is a film that takes the first six episodes of the TV series and features new animation and CG and a few different storyline details of certain characters but for the most part, creator Hideaki Anno made sure the film was faithful to the anime series.  The major difference between \\"Evangelion 1.01' and \\"Evangelion 1.11' is that the latter includes three minutes of extra footage (spread out during the first 15 minutes of the film) and scenes that were darker can now be seen much better.  Also, the Blu-ray edition boasts video and audio in HD and also comes with special features which 1.01 on DVD was barebones.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition.  I had the opportunity to compare the Blu-ray to the 1.01 DVD release from FUNimation Entertainment from last fall and I can tell you right now that this Blu-ray looks fantastic.  Detail is much more apparent and the vibrancy of the colors of the film literally pop onscreen.  The CG animation is top notch and overall, Gainax definitely went all out in creating a fantastic anime full of detail, vibrant colors and staying faithful to the anime series but making sure everything is updated and looks amazing.<br /><br />The DVD looks good but the main difference was that 1.01 was taken from a 35mm film transfer while the Blu-ray release was taken from the original High Definition digital file.  Not to say that the two look like night and day but there is a significant difference in terms of how vibrant and sharper the animation looks on Blu-ray.  \\"Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" looks absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for audio, I know how I was appreciative of the Dolby Digital 5.1 for  \\"Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" but for \\"Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\", you get a Dolby TrueHD 6.1 English and Japanese lossless soundtrack and there are MAJOR differences between the lossless soundtrack and its DVD counterpart.  On lossless, there is good use of the various channels for this film.  From hearing the music and main character vocal coming from the center and front channels, you will then hear the loudspeakers through the surround channels and then the rear surround channels carry audio that is different.  For example, in one scene in which Shinji is asking out of his mecha, you hear the main characters and vocals through the center and front channels, loud speakers and musical instruments on the surround and on the rear surround channel, you hear Shinji screaming in agony behind you.<br /><br />There is a huge difference between the lossless audio track and the Dolby Digital 5.1 track from the DVD.  Personally, the lossless audio is just phenomenal, how it is so immersive and envelops the soundscape from all directions was fantastic.  And I am so happy to find out that the Japanese audio track is lossless as well. Something that fans have wanted from anime on Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for the dubbing, personally, I have never listened to the original ADV Films English dubs, so I can't comment on how the newer voice dubs are with the original but from what I hear from friends and have read, fans were more than grateful for the English voice dubbing for \\"Evangelion 1.01'.  As for the Japanese voice acting, I've always felt the voice acting was solid.  Both tracks are similar for the most part in terms of audio featured on a certain channel but I did notice that the Japanese lossless track took advantage of the space.  For example, in the beginning you will see Shinji, his father and the scientist in a large open space.  In the Japanese lossless audio track, the sense of emptiness in that area and the echoing can be heard quite well on the lossless Japanese audio track.  But I also feel that the English dub was a slight more louder than its Japanese counterpart.  So overall, both lossless audio soundtracks are well-done.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the subtitles on the Blu-ray are in English only.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" contains the following special features:<br /><br />  * Rebuild of Evangelion 1.01 - (15:14) This segment features two versions of the pre-rendered 3D compared to the final cut.  The two versions are the Shiro Sagisu Version and the Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version and both music are different from one another but the segment is the same.<br />  * Angel of Doom Promotion - (2:20) A music montage video from scenes taken from the film.<br />  * News Flasher - (:55) Text teasers for \\"Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone).<br />  * Movie Previews - The movie previews contain the Preview 1 (Color Corrected Version), three versions of the \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" and three versions of the \\"Beautiful World\\" themes (sung by Hikaru Utada).<br />  * FUNimation Entertainment Trailers<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I first heard that the rebuild of \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" would take place and that these new films would be based on the television series, I wasn't so surprised because the series is so popular that it would definitely generate an extreme amount of money for GAINAX.  But one thing that I was not looking forward and what drove me crazy about the TV series was the character of Shinji Ikari.  Back in the mid-90's, I can easily remember how his whining really tested my patience and looking back, he was such an anti-hero, mainly because he was \\"emo\\" most of the time.  Always negative, always in a bit of depression and funk as he always felt people didn't care about him (and yes, I know that Hideaki Anno was clinically depressed when he was creating this film and parts of show was based on his depression) but it did get on my nerves at the time.<br /><br />But here we are nearly 15 years later and watching \\"Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" and after it was all done, I was excited and hoping the second film would come out stateside very soon.  Yes, Shinji still whines and is still depressed but the fact is the film is structured a bit differently from the anime TV series and somehow, the pacing is much easier to take for the viewer with the film version and felt that the screenplay for the first film, the quality of the animation and artistic backgrounds and the music all worked together fantastically.<br /><br />In a way, some part of me wants to rewatch first six episodes of the television series to find out the key differences (it's been 14 years and I can't recall too much from the television series except certain key scenes and the final episodes) were but personally, I found myself happy and content with this film that I look forward to seeing how Anno and the GAINAX crew tweak the next three films (and I can't wait until the final film).  But for the most part, I felt that the film, the voice acting, the animation, the art and everything else about the film was well done and fantastic.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, this release was just fantastic.  I felt the Eva 1.01 DVD release was good but after watching this Blu-ray release, \\"Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" is just fantastic and just an overall exciting release.  Fantastic picture quality, as well as phenomenal lossless Japanese audio.<br /><br />As for the PG-13 rating, yes, \\"Evangelion 1.11' has its share of violence and nudity, so this is not a series that you want to have your little kids around watching at all.  But overall, in the end, it was great to see Evangelion again but this time with the much improved reboot.  Nearly 15-years-later, it was definitely great to see Evangelion again but this time in a film sporting newer animation, CG, artwork and a solid screenplay and soundtrack.  But most importantly,  done in the way that the director Hideaki Anno had wanted but also what the fans have wanted as well.  And after I watched the film,  I can tell you that I loved it! The action, the drama is still intact.  Things may be a little different but still, fans of the original series will definitely enjoy this film release.<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone\\" is in the top 3 for best anime release on Blu-ray.

B00110K62U|5.0|Product is what I ordered and met all my expectations.  Seller provided the product as advertised and in the condition promised.  Five Stars.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Kurosawa's colorful, Japanese version of Shakespeare's 'MacBeth'.  Washizu [Mifune] is appropriately outraged, terrified, guilt-ridden and evil, as befits a man who has slaughtered his Lord and seized his lands, army and castle. He, and his guilty demons, are the stars of the movie set against the foggy, mystical background of a medieval fortress and surrounding forest.<br /><br />Washizu should recognize what he's in for but he chooses to believe a mocking ghost who foretells that he cannot be defeated unless the very forest attacks his castle.  Well we all know the rest of the story.<br /><br />The Japanese pageantry with its feudal customs is worth watching all by itself.  The climactic scene in which Washizu's warriors turn against him is magnificent action and cinema.  I'm wondering how they did it without seriously injuring Mifune?  I enjoyed the film but, to be certain, 'MacBeth' is my favorite of all Shakespeare's plays and I think Kurosawa did it justice with a very Japanese flare.
0307463745|5.0|This is the kind of book that you'll keep on your desk, next to your sofa, anywhere where it's in immediate reach when you need a bit of focus or inspiration. While it's a great (and quick!) read, you can also dip in and out, earmarking the essays you know you'll think about and want to come back to later. Also - the illustrations by Mike Rohde are wonderful, and really deliver the spirit of what the corresponding essay is about (note - these would be make fantastic motivational posters for an office, instead of the glib, sterile, Franklin Covey versions many offices buy).<br /><br />Buy the book - for yourself, your clients, your staff, etc. While you may not agree with everything in it, REWORK will make you - and the people your work with - think. That's always a great first step to change.

B00361HV02|5.0|Hayes and Been have come a long way from their high school days in San Francisco, and seem to finally be getting some broader attention in the wake of Howl and Baby 81.  Beat the Devil's Tattoo represents Leah Shapiro's debut with the power trio.  Formerly the touring drummer for the Raveonettes, Shapiro is stellar here.  She reminds me of Janet Weiss of Sleater-Kinney, only better suited to Hayes/Been.  For those of you who loved Baby 81 you will love this CD.  For those who preferred the direction B.R.M.C. was heading with Howl will be once again disappointed.  One of these days it would be nice of Mr. Been decided it would be artistically acceptable to include his cover of Dylan's \\"Visions of Johanna\\" which he performed recently at a concert in Vancouver on a future reissue of this release.  Courtney Jaye adds a fine guest vocal to \\"The Toll\\" which for the time being will console me for the want of Mr. Been's brilliant cover version aforementioned.  Outstanding tracks:  \\"Bad Blood\\", \\"War Machine\\", \\"Evol\\" \\"Shadow Keeper\\" and the closing ten minute twenty second \\"Half-State\\".  **** 1/2 stars
B002N1AEN2|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I'd heard one or two tracks on the radio or on TV shows, but it's not often that an album like that can keep you interested from start to finish. It's very well produced and the songs flow seamlessly from one to the next. Perfect background music for a small dinner party, curling up on the couch with a good book, or taking a nice leisurely bath. The girl has a gorgeous voice and there are some great instruments used. Very impressive for a 1st album.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I have to admit that I started taking notice of Pink because of my grandaughter....but she grows on you.  Her tunes are catchy and \\"real\\".  I love her voice and her performances.  What caught me by surprise is that my \\"old\\" man likes her too.  He never asks me to turn it off and one day I put the dvd on and walked out of the room and when I came back in was surprised because he was sitting there watching it....You know she is really good he tells me.  I am sure that appealing to Papas isn't her target audience but just shows you how good she is....thanks Pink!

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|A well known yet unspoken adage of the music business is 'With great success comes great experimentation.' Or at least that would seem to be the case in 2010 more than ever, where we've already seen a couple of high-profile pop stars tinker with proven formulas. On the heels of Lil' Wayne's baffling rock album Rebirth comes Gorillaz latest (and more artistically successful) offering Plastic Beach, a concept album which is named for, and subtly mocks, a landscape of cultural garbage. It's the furthest reach this band has made thus far into new territory, which is saying a lot.    PlasticBeach works and it doesn't. For one thing, producer and lead singer Damon Albarn (credited once-again as cartoon frontman \\"2D\\", along with Jamie Hewlett's \\"Murdoc\\") still knows how to construct a melody with the greatest of ease. However, you won't find anything with quite the gravitas of \\"Dirty Harry\\" or \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" here. Instead what you'll find are spacier than-usual jams replete with head-scratching cameos from the likes of Lou Reed and Bobby Womack. Indeed, hearing Womack's dominating contribution to a Gorillaz record on \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" is somewhat akin to hearing Pink Floyd's \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" for the first time. Much like the rest of Plastic Beach, it requires some time to digest before it can be fully appreciated.    The album also includes contributions from Snoop Dogg on the post-intro opener \\"Welcome to the World of Plastic Beach\\" where his laid back rhymes and typical subject matter fit in surprisingly well with the funky Gorillaz oeuvre. Mos Def is the sole vocalist on the alarmingly indulgent \\"Sweepstakes;\\" the results of which aren't quite as awe-inspiring as one would hope or as Mos himself might think they are.    Even with experimentation clearly being the main focus, there is plenty to like on Plastic Beach. \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" features Albarn's trademark \\"over-the-phone\\" vocals and a beat which suggests disco on dextromorphan.     The lead single \\"Stylo\\" puts less emphasis on it's involvement with Mos Def, to it's credit, and has another oddly explosive turn from Mr. Womack. The song does nicely incorporate a wicked bassline (somewhat reminciscent of LCD Soundsystem's \\"Get Innocuous\\"), and works very well; however without the stunning visual aspect of the Bruce Willis featured video it may come across as lacking some immediacy at first listen.    To be honest, much of the album sounds like yet another Damon Albarn pet project rather than a worthy contribution to the Gorillaz' cartoonish legacy. Make no mistake, the strong smoky melodies and sizzling synths the Gorillaz have come to be known for are still in tact; however, in an unexpected twist, much of the head-nodding menace of the previous albums (Demon Days, Gorillaz) is almost completely abandoned for what seem to be lush ambience and sentimental ballads. Some very good songs make up the majority of Plastic Beach; just don't expect to shake the proverbial butt before letting them grow on you first.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I credit this DVD with changing my body from \\"good\\" shape to amazing shape.  I have been exercising 4-5 days a week for about 8 years, and added this DVD to my routine in November of 2009.  Total transformation.  My arms, legs and abs are cut and defined now, more-so than they ever have been.  Combined with some diet changes, I have lost 10 pounds since starting this DVD, and that was with a pretty good baseline of fitness.  I do this DVD 2 times a week, doing other types of exercise the other 2-3 times a week (yoga, strength, cardio).  I also have BFBM and NMTZ, but I do them much less often than Shred.  After I started Shred, my other workouts starting feeling easier.  I never would have thought that a 20 minute workout could be so effective.  You can definitely start with a lower weight (2-3 lbs) and work your way up to higher weights.  I still use 2 lbs for some of the moves because they are so challenging.  Level 1 is a great place to start, but it will feel easy in no time!  Levels 2 and 3 are, in my opinion, equally challenging, and I would venture to say that Level 2 is actually the most difficult.  Level 2 incorporates quite a few moves in Plank Pose, which is killer!    I appreciate Jillian's no-excuses attitude.  If you know anything about Jillian you should expect her to be hard on you.  I find her sarcasm and tough attitude in the DVD to be motivating and fun!    I would not hesitate to purchase this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  I wouldn't use it as my only form of exercise, but I would highly recommend having it around for those days when you need a quick, highly effective workout that you don't have to plan out yourself.     Get ready to sweat!
1608201236|5.0|What a terrific ending and farewell this book is to the Adrien English five part series.  I think that all the other 5 star reviews have summed it up pretty well. What I wouldn't give to see this optioned as a TV mini series (hey, it's my review--I can dream in it if I want) but I do not believe they could possibly get all the nuances of the relationship between Adrien and Jake.  Also, the case in point, i.e. the mystery, is expertly rendered and quite complicated--no speed reading here.  I'm now looking forward to going back and rereading at least the first book because it was so many years ago.  I can't even remember how I came upon it....!  All I can say is that I've been hooked ever since.  Very highly recommended!
B002SF9YUM|4.0|I thought this movie was beautifully acted and tastefully done. I felt a deep sadness for these two characters and I was truly touched by this movie. Give it a try and you might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie and learning more about the subject after reading the book. The acting was splendid and the casting was perfect. Unfortunately the actual camera-work, specifically the constant/extreme tilting of the camera, was very off-putting. I sometimes felt rather sea-sick and would have to go back and listen again to what the actors had just said because all the tilting to and fro of the camera had really pulled my attention away from the script. Not sure what the director was thinking. By the end of the movie I wondered aloud why the director didn't just, \\"turn the bloody camera upside down and get it over with\\". Then, of course, he finally did in the last section of the film. Very odd. But other than having a possessed camera, I'd say the film is worth renting at the very least.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I LOVE ALL THE SONG ON SADE'S NEW CD. VERY CHIC AND VERY SADE. SHE STILL GOT IT GOING ON.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|I was so happy when I heard the Sade was comming out with a new album.  When it finally came to my power, i've listened to it, over, and over, and over, and I don't like it.  Their previus albums were way better.  It seems that the run out of ideas o sounds, I really don't like it, and I don't recomend it either.  See you guys
B003A9SW4O|5.0|I loved the Phantom of the Opera.  I was worried when I read negative reviews, but that wasn't to stop me from getting this jewel.  I have enjoyed listening to it so much.  The only thing which would have made this only better would  have been a visit by Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman.  I must say though that the singers on this album are fantastic.  So the music is wonderful.  I love having the whole recording, not just a few select songs.  ALL of the songs add to the beauty of this recording.  I need them to understand the whole show.  The story thus far is also very good.  I am so happy with this project from A. L. W.  Thanks for taking the chance to revisit a masterpiece  and taking it to the next chapter.  Now to see it on stage!! Bravo!
0385504225|1.0|definitely the worst of Dan Brown  not interesting  very similar to previous books  in the end, the author has tried too hard to present his own philosophy  disappointing end.    it is a book probably written to ride the 'wave'    SG
B002YICN74|2.0|Are you looking here for new, different music? Then you better look elsewhere. As most know, Nick Jonas started this side project to do music different than what he does with the Jonas Brothers. I fail to see the difference. After many reviews I've read that say he's so mature, amazing, destined to be around for a long time, and will win a few Grammy's along the way, I have to wonder: Are we listening to the same album? Firstly, the album only has a more mature sound in the music, not so much the lyrics. Secondly, for those of you who stress that this \\"amazing\\", you must listen to more music and understand there's a line between what Jonas is doing, and music that's rightly called amazing. Thirdly, it's a little early to say if Jonas will be around for a while, but I'll take a guess and say no. He does not strike me as a singer who will make the transition from pop poster boy to a respected artist. And lastly, there are many saying that he will win a few Grammy's next year. But then those predictions shouldn't be taken too seriously, seeing that they follow the reviewer saying \\"OMG!\\". To win a Grammy you have to be thought of an accomplished artist, not a Disney-based singer.        After listening to this album it's clear Jonas is trying to be taken seriously. But it's hard to think he's serious about being an artist when he's still signed to a Disney-owned label and his fans are mostly 10- to 13-year-old girls. After first listen, I thought Jonas' music sounded like John Mayer's. And after the second listen, I was sure of it. Examples of this are the songs, \\"Olive & an Arrow\\" and \\"Rose Garden\\". There are many comparing the two, and saying that Jonas is the \\"next John Mayer\\". And it does seem that Jonas is trying to be Disney's version of Mayer. The similarities between the two is that both are singer-songwriters and play the guitar. But what really sets them apart is how much talent they have at doing this. Compare Jonas' songs to Mayer's and you'll have a much different opinion of Jonas. And then even further compare their guitar-playing, and then see if you still think Jonas is amazing. Of course Jonas has a way to go before he can rightly be compared to Mayer. So before making that crazy prediction, think about what Jonas has to live up to, and if he could ever accomplish it.        Currently, Jonas is a singer. And as refreshing as it is to see a young singer taking part in writing their songs, he needs to extend his focus points beyond relationships and breakups. There is some singing talent in Jonas, but alot of the time it's like he's screaming and/or straining to hit the right notes. Lastly, if Jonas wishes to be thought of as an artist, he needs to breakaway from Hollywood Records, and try reaching into differerent age groups. Because Hollywood Records just does not seem like a good label for a young singer wishing to be around for a while and be thought of as a true, original, and respected artist.

0618918248|1.0|.  The evolution theory disproves itself making it junk science.    If a cell evolved out of mud, primordial ooze, or whatever -- what is the driving force for it to want to reproduce? and what is the force driving it to want to evolve? Without this driving force, it would simply exist and eventually die off not caring if it reproduced or evolved or not. Consequently, the theory of evolution requires the existence of God (the \\"driving force\\") and with the existence of God, it makes evolution unnecessary.    I believe everyone should study the theory of evolution since it is widely taught although they should also be taught the downfalls of such unproven false theories as well. It is important to study all sides of an issue in order to make informed opinions.    Why do those who believe in evolution feel so threatened with studying creationism? - because they know their evolution theory has so many holes and that they do not want to admit the existence of God? (because if they did admit God exists, they know they are accountable to Him)    Without a \\"driving force\\" (IE: God), evolution would never happen.  Why is it no evolutionst I have ever asked for an explanation of this \\"driving force\\" has even attempted to answer what the \\"driving force\\" is???  Are we suppose to believe the one celled organism (apparently evolving into a one celled organism with all reproductive organs present) decided it had to reproduce (or evolve) so it could one day become a human???  If evolution was real, the cell would have simply existed and died off and nobody would have ever known.   There is absolutely no sense to evolution and it cannot be explained scientifically.  .
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I heard couple of songs from The Killers before but this bluray really made me a fan of them. In contrast to other bluray concerts this was shot from many different angles producing a delightful watching experience. Sound is excellent too, bass performance is adequate, not too soft not overwhelming. 100% recommended.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|I was looking forward to the newest Lil Wayne LP, but then I noticed all the negative reviews it was picking up. I figured \\"Oh must just be a case of jealousy on the part of the reviewers who have a grudge against either Hip Hop or Lil Wayne.\\" You know that term culture has coined as \\"Hatters\\"? Well those are the people who dislike things or others or ideas just for the sake of jealousy and hate, I figured that must be the case as I have enjoyed Waynes previous efforts. Then I had the misfortune of listening to this album and finding little if anything to enjoy about it. The production here is very sloppy, neither the auto-tune \\"singing\\" by Wayne nor even the lyrics he drops help shape anything that resembles a good listen. An LP this bad could hurt Wayne if he turns off his own fan base to what made him the best selling artist in 2008. Tha Carter LP's earned him tremendous accolades and sold millions of copies. So was this album just a test bed for his strange creativity or has Lil Wayne gone off the deep end? I'm all for trying new things and stretching your horizons but this LP is like when a guy gets up in front of a crowd and tells a bad joke which no one laughs at and you start to feel embarrassed for that person.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie.  As expected from Quentin Tarantino, the movie is absurd in its humor, graphic in its violence, revisionist in its history.  We will enjoy watching it over and over again...
B0035TUBIE|5.0|This CD has rapidly made it onto my heavy rotation playlist and is a road trip staple! Such an interesting blend of jazz, tango, hip hop, pop, soul and something else that can't be articulated! Perhaps it's because she is Dutch, but there just isn't anything else out there like this. Anyone familiar with the Verve Remixed compilations will probably enjoy this modern adaptation of classic style and nostalgic sex appeal. While some of the lyrics fall short (\\"Mr. Band Leader, let's kick out the jam, give me something that will light it up, and make my feet go bam bam bam\\"?! Really?!), still, the overall groove and tone of the songs make up for it. Certainly worth a listen and several songs are posted on youtube in full with the official Dutch music videos...
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This movie deals with some sensitive issues and is not just a good-hearted movie.  It is most definitely a drama with some quirky humor in it.  While watching the movie, we used some of the issues tackled in the movie to open some dialogue.  It is something that we will watch multiple times.
B0036TGSRG|5.0|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" is a Roman Polanski political thriller of the first order. It is very cleverly plotted with gripping suspense and narrative drive that pulls you into the story. Some movies of late have seemed endless; in this one I was completely unaware of time passing and was completely enthralled by this story of the deepest intrigue. It's full of conspiracies, and the whole thing is done in a very classy, sophisticated manner that will remind you of Hitchcock at his very best. It's engrossing and involving.<br />The acting is top-notch with Ewan McGregor very effective as the ghost writer who has been brought in to liven up the memoirs of a former prime minister (played extremely well by Pierce Brosnan). He is a Tony Blair figure who has been fingered for war crimes by one of his former cabinet ministers. He has ordered the arrest and rendering out of Britain of suspects so that they could be tortured for information.<br /> The movie begins in gloomy, leaden weather on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard. A car is discovered without a driver. The man's body turns up later on the island, the victim of accident, suicide, or as we rightly assume, murder. Foul play indeed! He is the previous ghost writer who has now been replaced by McGregor. And of course he found out too much while doing his research. McGregor, of course, knows he could be a target as well.<br /> Polanski has deliberately made very mundane matters seem full of import and menace. It's full of clues and mysterious doings in the austere modernistic house so alien to the Vineyard. The cinematography and atmospherics are terrific. A lot of sinister-seeming goings-on.<br /> They don't make them this good anymore, and I think viewers will be pleasantly surprised. The intellectually curious and politically savvy will be impressed, I think. Pierce Brosnan by the force of his personality makes Tony Blair seem like a naïve schoolboy by comparison.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Well, I'm giving it 5 stars because I am such a fan.  This is actually a video about the making of the concert that did not happen.  It does let you in on some of the pressures and the intense detail work involved in staging such efforts.  It is not a video of a concert, and you should not expect to see a concert presented.
B00275EGWY|2.0|This undeservedly overly hyped out-of-all-proportion movie is a vast disappointment.  While successful in its depiction of the old adage that War is Hell, this movie really doesn't show us anything new that we haven't seen before in war movies equally well-done if not better done than this one.  It is a well-enough made pic about the hell that is (or was) Iraq since the movie is set in 2004.  But that is all it is.  There are some well-done action sequences and there is a requisite amount of tension since we are primarily dealing with a bomb squad...but there is no script worth mentioning, no great acting worth waxing ecstatic about, no profoundities to ponder, no characters we ever truly come to like and care about.  It is very akin in parts to \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  It owes alot to \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Apocalpyse Now.\\"  (The movies just mentioned, by the way, are all far better than this one.)  It's main character is a descendant of Steve McQueen's war-loving, isolated characters in \\"The War Lover\\" and \\"Hell is for Heroes.\\"  Why it won Best Picture is not because it is a great movie, but because it was the PC thing to do to help boost morale amongst today's military - and to break the male-dominated Best Director award by giving it to the Academy's first-ever female director.  And, as mentioned by many others on Amazon, there are several unrealistic sequences and a cliched death that I could see coming an hour before.  Now, I have not seen \\"Avatar\\" and have no desire to see so - the blue aliens just look very odious and unrealistic to me and James Cameron writes awful scripts.  (\\"Titanic\\" was a silly little love story riddled with lousy dialogue and a soap opera plot.) Having said that, maybe \\"Avatar\\" did get the shaft on Oscar night. If \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is what the Academy deems a \\"Best Picture\\" then, well, it is no wonder they forgot to include not just Farrah Fawcet in the sequence remembering those persons affiliated with the film industry who have passed over - but also Edward Woodward and Patrick McGoohan were ignored.  Anyway, as to \\"The Hurt Locker\\"...it hurt knowing I wasted the money buying the DVD and not awaiting its arrival on cable.have passed over - but also Edward Woodward and Patrick McGoohan were ignored.

B002M3GPOI|5.0|This one is for the ultra-King Crimson fans!  It is chock full with many different versions of their amazing first album.  I have more than my share of recordings of this masterwork, but I felt very moved when I received this package...and the DVD audio is simply the best version of this album I have ever heard!  If you just want the DVD-audio, you can get one of the smaller sets, but if you want to hear earlier versions, outtakes etc, you have to have this.  Sure, it could have included a lot more stuff (the Judy Dyble I Talk to the Wind, for example), but I am very, very happy with this set.  Viva Crimson and thanks Robert Fripp and Steve Wilson for taking the time and effort to make this so special!
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|Mr. Murakami's book \\"What I Talk about When I Talk About Running\\" is an elegantly written little book that explores the inner mind of the artist runner as he works at his craft. Mr. Murakami is a good, but far from an elite, runner. His runs and races serve a purpose in his life, a balance if you will. He writes about us, the runners in the middle of pack, who continue to fight time and nature. We are on the down side of the hill. We are not casual runners who are running to \\"get in shape\\". We are waging a battle against Father Time. He has written this book for us. You will not find a workout schedule or a dietary guide. This book is for the \\"soul\\" of the lifelong runner who has no \\"finish line\\". I have not read Mr. Murakami's other books but I am sure to pick one up soon. I read this book on kindle and that format fit it well.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|and you just may find this is a great album.  I think the biggest problem people will make is expecting this to be a typical Peter Gabriel album.  Appreciation of this album requires stepping outside of that expectation and listen to it as you would a new artist you have curiosity in with the benefit that the vocals sound like Peter's.  It also helps if you listen to the album without much thought of what is being covered.  Peter Gabriel has diverged significantly on most tracks from their original presentation that it is easier to listen to the songs as his rather than think about the originals.<br /><br />Upfront, I'll admit that I am not a diehard fan of his, but I am fan enough that I own most of what he has put out there.  The thing that has let me appreciate this album is that I have never been one to really favor any one particular Peter Gabriel album.  In fact, I love all the albums I own, but they were all growers.  The second thing that helped on this album is that I am not hugely familiar with the original tracks and without paying close attention, it is hard for me to even tell that they are covers on the ones I do know (with one or two exceptions).<br /><br />And this is what I really like.  This album takes some interesting songs that are already on the fringes of pop music and put them further out there.  It is experimentation, and I love the results.  Heroes is fantastic.  The dynamics of that song are wonderful with a great crescendo that builds throughout the song.  In this day of loudness wars, it is something that is often overlooked.  The Boy in the Bubble is nice, especially if you ignore what Paul Simon presented originally.  Mirrorball is great, but it is a case where Peter has not distinguished himself much from the original tune, although his presentation and orchestration are still pretty good.  What is strange on this tune is I always thought that Elbow's Guy Garvey has a voice similar to Peter Gabriel, and this song shows it.<br /><br />The album continues along similarly and while there are a lot of complaints about the music being too similar throughout, I think the key is to listen deeper.  Each song has unique elements that really demonstrate Peter Gabriel's artistry and breadth. The mood and emotion conveyed for each song really stand out in this format.  The orchestration, vocal inflections, tempo, and dynamics are used to convey these differences to subtle effect.  A song like Listening Wind is very subtle and conveys an emotion through its lack of dynamic variation, while on a song like My Body Is a Cage, the powerful dynamics in the latter parts of the song and dissonant harmonics in the beginning seem to scream at you.  That song may be the real highlight of this disc along with Heroes.  Both songs show the power of great dynamics, yet present such different moods.  In fact listening through the whole album with a close ear to the mood in the instrumentation and vocals will show that this album really isn't as dark as suggested in some reviews.  There are tracks with a positive attitude behind them.  The Book of Love is one track that seems to have an uplifting quality.  The only real negative I find is the Radiohead cover of Street Spirit.  As others have noted the sparse qualities really aren't much different than what Radiohead put forth before, but the vocals are lacking compared to any other song on the disc.<br /><br />In terms of recommendation; as much as I like this album, it is one that you have to be able to step back and think outside of Peter Gabriel's previous work to even have a chance at liking.  As you've already read in other reviews, this is not in the style of anything previously done.  You aren't going to find Genesis here. You won't find Us or Up.  However, given the chance you might be surprised to find that you like it and are glad it is different.<br /><br />As an addition, the special edition disc is nice and provides some more upbeat remixes that may even standahead of those on the main album.  It is worth the extra few bucks for what you get out of it.t is worth the extra few bucks for what you get out of it.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I picked up these, some silicone cases and the usb keyboard all at the same time.  These triggers are easy to install, they go on with a nice 'click' to know you've done it right.  Once on they stay on, even when the controller travels, say 6 to 8 ft, at random moments...  I'm not much of a driver or a fps'er so as far as functionality, I cant comment. But as far as being well made, having a nice feel and being an easy 1-time install: 5 stars.
B000F7CMRW|5.0|The CIA agent Bob Barnes with great experience in Middle East that falls in disgrace after an unsuccessful mission dealing missiles in Lebanese Republic; the investigation of the attorney Bennett Holiday related to the merge of two American oil companies, Connex and Killen the traumatic association of the energy analyst Bryan Woodman with the son of a powerful emir of Emirate, and the social drama of the Pakistani immigrant worker Wasim Khan that is fired by the oil company. This movie does an excellent job of illustrating just how politics and big business conspire to preserve the status quo which also protects their power and profits. This movie is a must see. A well researched story with excellent actors for the numerous roles.
B00138J32O|5.0|With Red Carpet Massacre, Duran Duran sound young, energetic and full of ideas. The music is mostly electronic, beat oriented, sleek, not overproduced in the least.  I welcome the change to dance/electronica much better than a rehashing anythings previous--way to go!  Skin Divers, The Valley, the title song, and Night-runner are among the best music I have ever heard anywhere. The beats are instinctive and tight, the vocals are masterful, smooth, and strong, as good as they ever sounded, incredibly enough. Sophisticated & refreshing.  You may not believe it when I say that this one of the best records ever made--until you hear it with an open mind.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Ryan Bingham who makes his living personally handing out pink slips, he's the top hatchet man at a company that other companies hire when they are downsizing. And since business is booming, his job keeps him on the go constantly. He flies all across the country, staying in a series of nice hotels. And although this itinerant lifestyle prevents him from having any kind of stable, regular life, this doesn't bother him in the slightest, he's thrilled to be a boy in a traveling bubble. \\"Up in the Air\\" is so truthful, particularly penetrating and effective movie. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age. Very entertaining movie, see for yourself.

B00005B4GU|3.0|In a rare moment of album to album consistency, Radiohead loosed \\"Amnesiac\\" a mere year after the head-turning electronica of \\"Kid A.\\" And like that previous album, Thom Yorke just sucked upon that lemon until his sour view of the world oozed up from the meditative piano and synthesized songs laid forth. This time, though, things seem more traditionally based in song structures. Both \\"Knives Out\\" and the opening \\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box\\" almost feel like the Abacab structures. I did say almost.<br /><br />And again, like \\"Kid A,\\" \\"Amnesia\\" struggles to maintain the level of quality before ultimately puttering out. \\"Hunting Bears\\" is the biggest offender here, although it seemed to be included just to give guitarist Johnny Greenwood a chance to finally play. All is forgiven by the delirious brass band that closes out \\"Life In A Glass House.\\" The horns that careened drunkenly on \\"Kid A's\\" \\"National Anthem\\" have sobered up enough to deliver an emotional wallop as Radiohead's dual-album experiment draws to a conclusion. In another two years, Yorke would return the guitars to the front of the band with \\"Hail To The Thief,\\" and return Radiohead to rock and roll.
B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|I thought long and hard before giving the film this score, but there are simply too many things that make Ponyo not work for me. This latest animated movie from Myazaki, who needs no introductions, had the intriguing premise of the sea. He spoke of the sea being a character in itself. I was intrigued to see the movie. I knew it had two children as the frontline, but being a fan of My Neighbour Totoro, I knew that Myazaki has an unreal insight into the mindset of children.<br /><br />The very first scene of Ponyo is breathtaking. Hundreds of fishes and jellyfish accompanied by breathtaking, oceanic music, finally zooming in on a man in a pinstriped suit, creating a bubble around his ship. We later find out that he is the father of one of the main characters, the fish girl Ponyo who wants to become human after befriending Sotsuke, a 5-year old boy living in a house by the sea. She is able to do this with a mixture of her father's magic (which she's inherited) and Sotsuke's blood (a drop of which she licked when he cut himself).<br /><br />The problem with Ponyo is the vagueness of the story. There is practically no sense of conflict to the story at all. There is no substantial threat to the characters, and they have very little development. That the characters are so young shouldn't justify this, if we remember Mei in My Neighbour Totoro. Also, Ponyo's father is so at odds with practically everything in the movie's universe, it's hilarious and off-putting at the same time. Ponyo herself is, personally, creepy rather than cute (and her numerous little siblings are no different). I don't understand how nobody finds it peculiar that Ponyo, supposedly a goldfish, has a humanoid face (and Sotsuke shows her to quite a few people). It's even weirder when Lisa (Sotsuke's mother, whom he oddly always refers to by name), an intelligent woman, sees Ponyo eat a slice of ham in whole (as a goldfish) and isn't at all surprised about it. The only really developed character, and the warmest, is the grumpy old woman at the retirement home where Lisa works.<br /><br />What Ponyo lacks in substance, it makes up for in visuals. The movie's highlight in my opinion is where Lisa and Sotsuke are driving down a road continually drenched in waves, on top of which Ponyo is running. These waves take on the form of giant fish.  A wonderful piece of animation. The many underwater scenes are beautiful, with underwater creatures big and small swimming. Something about the overall production values of the visuals feel a bit unfocused, though. The morse code scene is then hilarious.<br /><br />On the whole, however, Ponyo feels like a lot of elements that just don't work together. Sotsuke faces no real trials like other young Myazaki protagonists have faced. None of the characters feel like they serve any real purpose other than to bring Sotsuke and Ponyo together. The film's subplot of Ponyo's magic causing a rift in the natural order and causing the moon to come closer (which explains the flood) is never sufficiently delivered to the audience.<br /><br />I was simply expecting a better delivery from a master storyteller like Myazaki. Ponyo may only really work for the smallest children, but that's excluding a large part of Myazaki's fanbase. He's one of those filmmakers whom I respect for continually showing people that animated movies can be for people of all ages. Ponyo obviously aims at a lower age group, but I just hope that the children will be more drawn into Sotsuke and Ponyo's story than I was (there is so much courteous and/or cute dialogue that I felt downright embarrassed at points).<br /><br />Decent, but definitely not the brightest spot in Myazaki's repertoire.grumpy old woman at the retirement home where Lisa works.

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed reading Rework.<br /><br />This book shows us that most of the stuff you learned or are learning in business school might actually be wrong. It might actually be outdated, and it might not work anymore. Bust most important of all, it's being done differently by a couple of guys who walk the walk and don't just write the books. It's also pretty easy. It's not heavy concepts and skills that require a MBA and years in school, it's advice and skills that everyone can use to be a lot more successful!<br /><br />I sat down to read the book on my kindle and wanted to just read a bit, get a taste if you will... But I found myself hooked and I read the entire book in one sitting. It's a fast and easy read and should be enjoyed quickly.<br /><br />Jason & David want you to read it quickly so you can get down to doing work that matters.<br /><br />Thanks for writing this book. I'll be referring to it often.<br /><br />Noah
0446567337|2.0|I think so many of his books are getting to be the same.  Nothing grabbed me about this one.  Did not have that WOW factor of some of his earlier books.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Yes, these are scraps. I have no idea what the intentions of Janie are with this release, and I frankly don't care. I love getting to hear some of this stuff, especially the title track. Lover Man and Hear My Train A Comin' are worth the price on their own. Like South Saturn Delta, this is a look into a great artist doing his thing in a sometimes unpolished view. It is what it is, and I love what it is. I for one think that these releases are way better than the grave desecration tactics employed by Douglas on \\"Crash Landing\\" and his other releases. Yes, Janie and Eddie Kramer employed some studio trickery to put together some of this stuff in a releasable form, but at least they used musicians that really played with Hendrix.     I don't care about all this stuff really, the point is Jimi's scraps kill most other artists official work. This is worth having if you love hearing Jimi do his thing.
B001HQZKF6|5.0|When entertaining guests, I use this blu ray to display my 5.1 theatre system. Simply put, this is the best concert blu ray we own.  If you are a fan of The Police, it is even that much better as I am only a casual fan.  The video is breathtaking and the audio is every bit as magical.  The crowd is lively and the performance is masterful.  My favorite track from this blu ray is \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" as the focus on the drum solo is better experienced than informed.  Enjoy.
B001R4CKGU|2.0|when Hading is good he is very good but much of thebook consists of metaphysical. cosmological and mystical musings that are impossible to understand  I defy anyone to tell me what the author was trying to say in those passages  A very difficult read        the autu0
B002ZG997M|5.0|FIRST!!! Do not let anyone tell you about the movie before watching it. You don't want any of the surprise to be spoiled for you. All I will say is I saw it twice at the movie theatre and loved it both times. The second time makes you go back at look at things in the movie much differently. Great movie!!! I think this movie was over looked at the theatres due to Avatar. But this is a much better film. Denzel should win an Oscar for this role.
1423119509|4.0|Ordered this set after seeing the movie.  We thought it was a good way to get all 5 books for a reasonable price. The books were in perfect condition, however the box was slightly damaged and the \\"hidden compartment\\" had nothing in it.  It was pretty obvious that someone had opened the box, removed the collectors items and replaced the books so no one would notice.  I've ordered a replacement and we'll see if that one includes ALL the items.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|By Olivia and Telisha    By Olivia    The movie The Princess and the Frog is about a girl who has a dad and a mom. Her dad wants a restaurant, but never gets one. The girl takes his place and earns the restaurant. Before she earns the restaurant, when she prays a frog appears by her window. If you see the movie, you'll find out what happens next.     My favorite part of the movie was when the crocodile came on the boat like a fox. He went on the boat because he wanted to play jazz with the people but they just scattered him off like a cat. When I saw this I was eager to see what was going to happen next.     A movie that inspired me to go see The Princess and the Frog was the movie Cinderella. It has romance and balls in it just like The Princess and the Frog. The part with romance in Cinderella that inspired me was when the prince and Cinderella get married.     If you are someone who is looking for a fairytale with romance then the movie The Princess and the Frog is the movie for you. The movie is sweet and weird. It is sweet because Princess Tiana finds love. It's weird because this girl kisses the frog and gets kissing marks all over the frog.     By Telisha    In the Princess and the Frog, a princess has to sweep and clean. Her name is Princess Tina. When she is all grown up, her dad dies and she promised him that she will get the restaurant that he wanted. Princess Tina had to get something from her friend to make this happen.     My favorite part is when a frog kisses the princess, and she turns into a frog! I laughed so hard that I fell out of my chair. At the end of the story, they kissed again, and they became humans. They got married and lived happily ever after.     My name is Telisha Bovell, and I am telling you this is a great movie. You don't even want to stop watching it. This movie is just like Cinderella. They both met princes. You could find it in your local theater now.
B001DHXT34|4.0|I love this movie, but the quality didn't look too great when  played on our DVD player. It looked a bit hazy and the colors weren't vivid. We recently purchased an upconverting, Blu Ray player. I was pleased that the the DVD looked much nicer when we used our new player.  But, beware, if you're playing this on a DVD player that doesn't have the upconverting feature, you might be disappointed with the quality of the picture.<br /><br />Disc 1-collector's edition includes: spotlight on location; deleted scenes; outtakes; makeup application & design; Seussian set decoration; visual effects; Faith Hill, \\"Where Are You Christmas\\" video.  Max's Playhouse which includes Sing-Along songs; read-along: \\"The Care and Feeding of a Grinch\\"; dress the Grinch & rhyme time.<br /><br />Disc 2-All new deluxe edition features include: enhanced feature commentary with Academy Award winner Ron Howard; more Who-liday recipes; fun-filled \\"Who-bilation 1000\\" games; put the Grinch in your photographs (on DVD-Rom) & much more!<br /><br />I've only watched the movie and haven't taken time to play any games or do any of the activities. If I do, I'll update my review.<br /><br />The snow globe is very cute. It's approx. 4 1/4\\" wide x 4\\" high. The glass globe is a little bigger than a tennis ball.<br /><br />5 stars for the great movie; 3 stars for the quality; 4 stars overall
1439170045|4.0|A memorable book club selection replete with the Oprah-esque trope of triumphant, strong woman in depressing, no-win scenario. It is a fresh take on the story of dementia as told from the perspective of the patient, instead of through the eyes of the caregiver. The story behind the story is also a good one. Lisa Genova was told this book would hurt her academic career. Undeterred, she started selling copies of the book from the trunk of her car, until it finally got picked up by a big publisher.
0439023491|4.0|I'm not going to argue that this is great literature or even the most original book I've ever read.  But its a quick, engaging and fun read even if its pure bubblegum.  I also think I enjoyed this book more than The Hunger Games.
0375714839|4.0|In the first of the two, we get the life of young Marjane from the time of the shah, to the attack by Iraq. Marjane's family try to explain to this little girl about her family's royal history, her family friends' experiences in prison, and her new role as a young woman in an Islamic state. By the end of book one, Marjane is on her way to Austria, both to escape the conflict in Iran, and also to go to school.<br /><br />In book two, Marjane grows from a young teen, into a near adult. She begins living in a convent, but is soon cast from home to home. From her life in Austria, she meets people who have different political views, who have different codes of morality, and who have had little experience with death and war as she has. Over time, Marjane becomes disillusioned with the person she has been turned into while living in Europe and returns to Iran, where she later marries and struggles against the strong Islamic rule being forced on its citizens.<br /><br />Altogether, I thought Marjane's coming of age during the conflict in Iran and through the new Islamic control of the region to be brilliantly and poignantly discussed in her two graphic novels. These two novels covered issues of history in the region, discussed moral laws imposed on the nation, discussed the view of the West as imposed on the East, and many other tough issues of nation and culture. Overall, I think these graphic novels are very well done, and give the reader a great view of Iran and its culture.
0764207407|5.0|How do you take a book that is almost 200 years old and make it interesting and new to the modern reader? That's a trick question, I can't imagine not enjoying Jane Austen's writing no matter how antiquated the society and its ideals are. Of course I took as many literature classes in college as time allowed so I may be an exception to the rule.<br /><br />The story itself? The cast of characters is impressive; you've got the calm introvert, the passionate young thing, the rake, the snob, the neighbors you roll your eyes at whenever they show up, the man of integrity, etc. And the plotlines are almost as thick as the characters! Frivolity and fun, true love, desperate, gut-wrenching heartbreak, intrigue and secrets, scandal, mix-ups, horrible nasty people you want to punch in the nose (I know I'm not the only one who thought that.)<br /><br />I've made it a personal project to read all of Austen and this was my third foray and probably my favorite to read - which surprised me because as absolutely wonderful as Edward and Col. Brandon are, I don't swoon over them like Mr. Darcy or Mr. Knightley. Not to sound smarmy about it but I think it did have to do with the \\"insights\\" in my margin.<br /><br />The book has a pictographic key so the notes in your margin are categorized by things like historical and cultural details, film references, themes of faith, Austen facts and tidbits, and comments and asides as well as frowny face and smiley face comments. As much as I LOVE tidbits and asides in all categories what I really enjoyed were the smiley and frowney faces - it was like reading the book with a friend who hated the same parts you hated and loved, laughed and smiled at all your favorite places.<br /><br />(I got quite the laugh out of the film reference which stated: In the 2008 miniseries, Edward's bad mood leads him to chop wood in the pouring rain. The film was written by the same person who had Darcy jump in a lake. We approve of both.<br />And yes I did run outand rent the 2008 miniseries after reading that. Kidding. Sortof.)<br /><br />If you were one of those women (or girls - I knew lots of teens who did this) who ran out and bought Pride and Prejudice the book after watching the 2005 film and found the book hard to read - I'd recommend trying it again with the \\"insight edition\\" which will inevitably lead you to Sense & Sensibility. These editions really do a brilliant job of bridging a 200 year generation gap.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I was worried about the quality of this soundtrack after reading a few negative early reviews of Love Never Dies, but I (and all who have read such reviews) can REST EASY now!!!  Andrew Lloyd Webber has produced a winner --- a brilliant followup to one of his most beloved works, Phantom of the Opera.    The score has some dull points, which knock its quality down a little from the original Phantom score that was virtually devoid of low moments.  Don't get me wrong, though --- there are still PLENTY of memorable tracks in this soundtrack.  Select tracks can even stand \\"toe-to-toe\\" with the original Phantom ---- \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" is now probably one of my favorite musical tracks of all time......I must admit, though, that its meaning and tie-in to the original Phantom musical makes it all the more amazing.  If it was a stand-alone piece, it merely would be \\"good\\".....in this story, however, and with the interpretation of Ramin Karimloo, it is vaulted to new heights.  Webber does a good job at revisiting a few select melodies from the original Phantom, too.  While I would have loved to hear MORE old melodies tied in, I respect his subtle approach --- we get just enough to enjoy the references, but he clearly shows that he was focused not on rehashing old work but about forging ahead with new material.    A few reviewers comment on not being pleased with some of the atonal and dissonant passages, such as those in the 1st track and those given to the \\"freaks\\".....to me, these passages actually added to the body of work as a clever representation to the Phantom's musical style --- reminded me of the snippets of  Don Juan Triumphant that we got at points in the original Phantom of the Opera.  I love the contrast between these parts and the more sweeping, romantic parts associated with the relationship between Christine and Phantom.  It is all very Prokofiev-esque --- reminds me of Prokofiev's Cinderella at times.    I must admit that the story arc made me a little disappointed......not for the story, per se, but for the characters that were carried over from Phantom.  It's a very interesting take, though, and I respect it.  It won't leave you feeling good at the end, but it's a necessary journey.  Strong similarities to \\"Miss Saigon\\" throughout --- especially in the 2nd act.    BOTTOM LINE:  If you are any sort of a Phantom of the Opera fan, BUY THIS CD!!!!  You will certainly not regret it and I guarantee that when you are finished listening to it and reflecting on it, you'll be dying (no pun intended) to pop it back in the CD player for another listen.  Don't expect to get a carbon copy work of the original Phantom stylistically, but expect to get the next chapter for these characters and to find out how they have matured (in both their lives and in their musical style, now that we are removed from \\"The Opera House\\" and placed in \\"Coney Island\\").  Why are you still reading this review???  Go out and get this CD!!!!
B0035KESBE|5.0|Ok... if you're a michael jackson fan, you know Sony has never been able to produce a quality video product (save the recent release of \\"This is It\\" which was reference quality Blu-ray release).     So, it was with much suprise that after 20 years Moonwalker comes out on DVD... by Warner... and its indeed pristine quality.  4/4 on the DVD Scale. (I should note, I purchased this disc from Toymanilla Collectibles [Phillippines], so I cant speak for every seller).    I wont go into the movie description since you're buying this as a fan I venture to guess.    This is just an update about the quality of the disc:    MPEG 2  Avg Bit rate was 5.40mbps total disc rate was 7.50mbps  Region was listed as \\"3\\", but the software reader tells me its actually regions 1,3, and 4. (It played on my region 1 laptop with no problems).  Sound quality was very good for a product so old. Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround only. 192 kbps. (It would have been nice to have PCM encode, but hey... can't complain.)    subtitles clear.    Sorry I don't have the other version listed as 2009 release. It appears to only have a different cover, but don't quote me on it. I dont own that one.    If you're a fan, lay hold of the MSi-Warner Version and you can't go wrong.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|With their sixth album in twenty five years, Sade has returned with their latest album Soldier of Love and has recaptured the imaginations and ears of listeners worldwide. With their lush sounds and renowned stunning smoky vocals they have set a benchmark for any other artist to live up to.<br /><br />Their opening track The Moon and the Sky is rippling with emotive vocals and lyrics setting the tone for the entire release. The track is a welcome reminder of what Sade is all about. The ambience and relaxing qualities make the track standout from anything that they have previously done.<br /><br />The title track Soldier of Love is far more percussive than anything the band has ever released. The sharp hip/hop sounds are a step in a new direction for the band while, at the same time, staying true to what is almost expected.<br /><br />Babyfather shows the band experimenting with an almost Jamaican sound and is composed of lush sounds and lyrics telling the story of a father/daughter relationship. It's sweet and melodic and leaves the heart of anyone who has troubles with their father aching to pick up the phone and just call him to say hello.<br /><br />Not content to stay with one genre, further experimentation comes across in Be That Easy which is a borderline country music track. The relaxed vocals and melody create a comfortable atmosphere for the ear. The unobtrusive sounds  are calming and blend easily into the background.<br /><br />Other tracks on the album blend seamlessly into each other. The smooth production and careful consideration, time and effort that has been put into each and every song shows resplendently and showcases the sheer overwhelming talent that the band posses.<br /><br />The final track is The Safest Place and will remind any listener of what they experienced when they first heard Sade. The same ambient instruments. The relaxed atmosphere. The chilled out vocals. The culmination of what has made Sade such a landmark band since their inception all those years ago.<br /><br />Soldier of Love is not only an album suited to a dinner party but can be played when ready to kick back and relax after a long day at work. The true majesty of Sade is in abundance throughout the release. The beauty of the vocals and the calm tones of the music. It is a testament to why they have enjoyed such longevity without the ongoing and continual releases of some other artists which pollute today's airwaves.not only an album suited to a dinner party but can be played when ready to kick back and relax after a long day at work.

B0000640VO|3.0|Amelie: (Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain): 6 out of 10: Sweet, light and sometimes a little irritating; this strangely adult fable starts out very strong and sinks under the weight of it's too cute for words protagonist and her self made predicament. Amelie is a strange bird indeed. She seems initially one of those wonderfully original creations but as time in the movie marches on it becomes obvious. She is a twelve-year-old girl in a woman's body.     Yup she has silly crushes plays silly pranks and a vivid imagination. In fact one could very much see her being played by a twelve year old. This would work perfectly if the movie wasn't so jarringly adult in other ways. (Amelie's quest works in a porn shop, people having hook-up sex in a daytime café)     It is more of a tone issue than any objection to adult content. (As a glance at most of my other reviews will testify.) Also like most twelve-year olds Amelie pulls pranks and games a little too long. (After the 2-hour mark or so I was practically screaming at the screen to get on with it)     Now don't get me wrong the first hour or so is one of the most delightful screen experiences. I loved the traveling gnome (which started a fad that lives on today) and liked the obsessive tape recording man in café.    It also shows a true fantasy version of Paris like You've You Mail's version of New York. In fact when Amelie is helping others rather than on her own quest the movie seems to move briskly and with purpose.     It is only in her pursuit of love that Amelie fails as both a person and a movie. Just like most twelve-year-old girls.
B002UEW31I|2.0|This movie starts out good and quickly becomes boring and depressing.  I think they didn't know how to end it.  Save your money.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|In reading some of the chatter about Love Never Dies in its preview performances, people were being misled to believe that this was going to be a disaster, yet, as a long time Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, I believe we see the composer returning to the Phantom of the Opera - one of his greatest artistic triumphs and approaching it not with reverence but with great maturity as a composer and as a human being.      In Love Never Dies, the characters have moved forward 10 years.  Time has passed since the Phantom cried at the end of the original \\"...it's over now, the Music of the night\\" - but his love for Christine hasn't passed as he longs for her.  Anyone who loved the original wouldn't find that unfathomable, and see how it's fully expressed in the soaring new anthem \\"Till I Hear You Sing\\", just one gem in a score filled with some of ALW's most romantic and beautiful tunes.    That's one example of how this show succeeds on multiple levels.  Fans might be saddened by the twists and turns the story line takes, but it does what a good sequel should do - moves the story further.  Musically though, there's no argument.  With just a few brief quotes from the original Phantom sprinkled in, you can hear and feel the emotions of the characters that they've experienced since we last met them.  It's been a fascinating experience for me as a fan of the original who first saw the Phantom in 1991 to hear the development of the characters, the music and the story.      I suppose people have grown attached to the original characters in the 20+ years Phantom has been playing in London and NY, yet for those who've dealt with tragedy among love in their lives, the honesty of Love Never Dies speaks on that deeper more mature level.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This was hugely enjoyable.  The new cast did a beautiful job portraying our favorite Star Trek characters and the story line was riveting.  I was worried about bringing in new actors but they carried it off so well I can't imagine them not being in the next Star Trek movie.  The special effects were perfect.  I thought I was on a ship in space.  There wasn't anything to distract from the story. The new crew are just great but I think the best new actor played Scotty.  Buy this movie.  You won't regret it.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This disc is HOT !!! Music in my opinion, right now, has gone in a direction where I would never want to go!...now music is about how one can sell their looks & body which we all know is NO music at all...but GAGA is bringing something back that has been lost since the 80's blessed us with Madonna!(my idol)  There is not one bad track on this disc..BAD ROMANCE just makes me want 2 move..ALEXANDRO has an upbeat tempo that grabs u & does not let go...MONSTER...disco as we know it....DANCE IN THE DARK has that sing along vibe with a wicked pop feel that will have your toe on tap...TELEPHONE is another track that I feel DID NOT require Beyonce's help at all.Gaga held that song down on her own...SO HAPPY I COULD DIE is one of my faves, my body cannot be still while listening...that bass is a KILLER!! and last but not least, TEETH makes a girl wanna give a taste of her \\"BAD GIRL MEAT!\\"  This is by far, the best purchase that I made musically in a long time.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|The main problem with the final generation Gamecube Controller that was made for us here in the states (And is in fact still available if for whatever reason you should feel the need to throw your money away on one from Nintendo's Online store)is that well... It's crap...    The sparkling silver coating to the control will start to rub off within mere minutes of use revealing large ugly binge colored balds spots after roughly a weeks time... And the buttons where just flat out NOT MEANT TO BE USED making the entire point of the device nonsensical at best... (Just about anything will brake on it within a months time if used regularly)    That rant having been sorely noted (Sorry) this brings us to this lovely little import... Absolutely NOTHING that I mentioned that is an issue with the final print American model is an issue with the Japanese one... While not as heavy as the earlier print (Purple & Black) American controllers this White one is built every bit as well... (In other words buttons & sticks just don't brake on them without gross excessive force)    The Controller has the same kind of soft yet hard paper like feeling plastic that the Nintendo DS has had coating the inside of those units since the release of the DS Light... Which gives the controller a strange almost silk like texture when held...    And to make the Controller more sensible for the Nintendo Wii (A primarily wireless device) it was given a ten foot long cord so you could still sit a reasonable distance from the unit without the need of any extra extension cords or having the unit sit closer to you...    All in all this one is a no brainier, If you are in the market for a Gamecube Controller given the price of those horrible third party knockoffs and the fact that Nintendo themselves doesn't offer anyone outside of Japan ANYTHING better then this (In fact what they offer is actually worse) well... This import really is your one & only choice... Thankfully once you have it (Unless you are thetype who THRASH'S there controls) you should be good to go for a vary long time...
1594488843|5.0|As a career law enforcement officer and retired Sheriff I conduct training for law enforcement agencies on a regular basis. Leadership, management and human resources are the areas I consult in most often so the topic of motivation is always in our discussions; espcially when we are dealing with change and sustaining that change. I thought that DRiVE was right down our alley and I will use information found in the book in our future classes.    A real problem in government is that many people get their jobs and think they can just die there. They get civil service protection and simply show up, walk around a little and go home at the end of the day. It zaps the life out of coworkers and the organizations. When a real worker gets hired and wants to get production under way, they find it difficult because of the many employees who don't want change and don't want their boat rocked. So how do we motivate these people since in many cases we are stuck with them in some fashion.    Pink's ideas have given me tools to share with supervisors, managers and leaders in these organizations to help them become change agents and get things done in the most effective and efficient way. I appreciate his research, thought processes and willingness to share with us.    Great Book!    Rod Shoap  Encore Security Professionals
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Casablanca blew its competition out of the water in the 1943 Oscars. After seeing what other films were nominated, it didn't even seem fair. The cast is amazing with Bogart and Bergman as the leads accompanied by Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, and Peter Lorre in the supporting cast. The writing is exquisite as is the cinematography.  The story was revolutionary considering it is about World War II and was filmed during World War II. But it is not just about the war and its effect on the characters. It is also about romance, dreams, and the price we pay to protect the ones we love. Some say the ending is 90% of the movie, those who hold that true will not be disappointed.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|Fascinating concept...but several \\"modern\\" moments do this a great disservice.  They were absolutely not needed and ruin this as being appropriate for younger teens.      Also, the lead actress is not quite compelling enough for this role.  She would have been fantastic in some of the other parts, however.      This could have been five stars and family friendly...

B002QFYJF4|1.0|I hated this movie and I'm trying to figure out why.  Here are some possibilities:  1. The movie was pointless.  Or maybe the point was that everything is bad in life and that people are either bad or they are imbeciles.  That seems to have been the director's point of view.  But what is the logic in that?  No one would go to a movie where the only action was people sitting around laughing like hyenas, would they?  So why all the critical acclaim for a movie that only shows pain and suffering and swearing and cruelty?    2. It was confusing.  The guy loses his gun but gets it together to go out on a date.  The actors, even the half-dead ones, all spontaneously sing the same gloomy song.  Frogs rain down and break a lot of windows.  Penis crazy Tom Cruise gets sensitive enough to restrain himself from kicking a dog.  Myriad drugs get taken with illogical consequences.    3. Julianne Moore was a joke.  Julianne's been one of my favorite actresses for a long time, but the script has her only saying variations on the f-word and making unattractive faces.  that's boring and her performance is boring as well.  Why couldn't she have stayed in that car?    4. It was too long.  More than three hours of this!!  People who like this film are masochistic.  Three plus hours of a crappy movie whose only goal is to make you feel like crap.  By the way, I have seen and enjoyed countless so-called depressing movies.    5. It tried to copy Altman's Short Cuts, but failed miserably.  Short Cuts is depressing as hell, but you actually CARE about the people involved.  That's why it's a tragedy.  In Magnolia there is no one to care about because they are all absurdly one-dimensional.      So I guess I've figured out why I didn't like the film.  It's only my opinion.  See it and decide for yourself.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Thank you Miyazaki for another great film. I love Ponyo, she's a real go-getter! Granted, it's not Miyazaki's greatest movie or my favorite (Kiki's Delivery Service), but still well worth seeing. The transfer is great on the standard version (I watch on a Sony Bravia with HDMI connection). Don't think of it as a Little Mermaid ripoff, because it's not. A wonderful story of acceptance that kids will love, and even those over 50 (like myself)
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I am a South AFrican and was outside the stadium when the final game in the movie was played. This was a real event. Only someone who was there can tell you the emotional impact of that game and what Nelson Mandela and Francois Pienaar (captain of the Springbok rugby team) achieved. For several hours after that game there was not a single crime in South Africa. The whole country united as one to spur our team on. I, unfortunately, did not attend the actual game but I was outside that stadium and the fellowship and goodwill that emanated from it had to be experienced. I went to see the movie with my youngest daughter here in the USA. She was only 8 years old at the time of that game. She could well recall the impact of the emotion and, for me, it was a pleasure moment relived. The movie did it justice and the two actors performed very well in their roles as two South Africans. I loved the movie and definitely want to see it again. Always a South African. We are a nation of such spirit.

Each chapter is like a day in the life of Pooh, complete with life lessons that offer the reader a different understanding of how to approach situations that we encounter in life. The book is focused on Pooh, his way of life, and how he sees the world.         The author makes his book easy to understand and relate to by using the simple characters from A.A. Milne's stories as a source of lessons on life from a Taoist perspective. You get to know the characters and their perspective and you can then make a personal connection with them by thinking about how you might approach situations in life in a similar, or perhaps different way.         Most people think that Pooh is for little kids, but in actuality, this book applies the story of Pooh's adventures to the Tao and shows how Pooh's life is a perfect way to learn the Taoist philosophy. The author also shows how the other characters in the story do not represent the Tao. For example, Eeyore is always complaining: \\"Good morning, Pooh Bear, said Eeyore gloomily. If it is a good morning, which I doubt.\\" Rabbit is brainy but not smart; Piglet is often scared and fearful; Owl knows a lot, but keeps to himself and learns from books more than from life. Pooh, on the other hand, has many points of view, is quite humble, and sees life through a very simple, yet profound perspective.  He is more interested in being himself than in making a big deal about who he is and what he does.        One weakness of this book is that as he is explaining some about Taoism, the author tries to compare the Tao to Buddhism.  In his attempt to do this, he talks about Buddhism in a sort of negative way, stating that, \\"To Buddha, life on earth was bitter, filled with attachments and desires that led to suffering...a revolving wheel of pain for all creatures.\\"  Hoff doesn't represent Buddhism fairly in this statement, as it doesn't really capture the bigger picture of what Buddhism is about and therefore doesn't give the reader an accurate comparison of these philosophies. Another weakness of the book is that you can only take Winnie the Pooh so far, as a source of life's lessons, and then it sort of runs out of juice.         Overall, though, instead of a dry and boring approach to learning about Taoist philosophy, this book teaches it through reflecting on the fun and often entertaining adventures of these familiar and loveable characters. Hoff teaches about Taoism by using the philosophy as a lens for looking at life, as we reflect on the different ways each character in Pooh's world approaches the situations they find themselves in and the meaning they make of their experiences. He points out that each character sees life differently, depending on who they are and their unique perspective. He encourages us to embrace the \\"Pooh Way,\\" of effortless, egoless, simplicity.

0316548189|5.0|I decided to read this book after seeing the movie \\"Invictus\\". I love to read autobiographies of significant historical figures, people who have made a difference in the world. This book is very well written and readable. The thing that strikes me the most is the honesty of Mr. Mandela. He does not try to paint himself as anything but an ordinary human being. His humility is obvious as you read the details of his life, including his mistakes. His life is an incredible example of persistence in the face of unimaginable circumstances. It is sobering to read of how human beings can treat one another based on unimportant external circumstances. As you read about apartheid in South Africa in this book, you come to realize just how horrible it was. Throughout my reading of the book, it caused me to ponder the \\"apartheid\\" that occurred in our own country during the same period of history that this book covers. The really incredible aspect of the story is Mr. Mandela's attitude toward his oppressor and the fact that when his party achieved power that the roles were not simply reversed. This book is one I recommend to anyone who is interested in world history and cares about freedom and equality.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|We gave this garage to our son for his 3rd birthday and it is a huge hit.  The fact that the ramps aren't glued on is a bonus for us, because when we were putting it together with him he didn't want us to attach the ramps!  He was already playing with them with his vehicles.  Now he carries the ramps around and uses them very creatively, and can easily attach them on the garage when he wants.  Oh, and he likes the garage too!     It didn't take too long for us to put it together (maybe 30 focused minutes, at most) but the screws provided aren't very sharp so you either need to use a lot of force (more than I could muster) or use a drill as a power screwdriver, although that's risky.  In the end my husband chose the brute force option.      On an only somewhat related matter, I think it's absurd to rate a toy on educational value (as Amazon asked me to do), as we are all learning something from everything we play with or use.  I know what they mean, but it's all so subjective.  What one person values as \\"educational\\" is often not shared.   In fact, I think the most \\"educational\\" toys aren't toys at all but silk scarves, boxes of cardboard, sticks, buckets, water, trees, etc. etc.  The more structure and rigidity a toy has the less \\"educational\\" it is in my mind.

B001HN697M|1.0|This movie is your classic, privileged girl that loves a slave boy and defies her father, and her people with their forbidden romance. It seems like this story has been told dozens of times in the past, only this time the privileged girl is a vampire and the slave boy is a werewolf lycan. There is big budget action sprinkled in throughout the movie. The art style really sets it apart from any other movie, because its dark, blue and set in the medieval ages. The movie is devoid of life and good acting, but I guess when they're vampires they have to be devoid of life. It's a chore to watch, but if you love werewolf versus vampire action with swords instead of guns, then this movie is for you!

B002UZCJP2|4.0|Movie - 3.0    Surrogates strikes me as a another sci-fi actioner with a very good concept on how society as a whole is becoming more and more reliant on the uses of advancing technology. Why worry about actually exercising when all you have to do is transfer your brain waves into a life-like robot that's designed to look the way you want it? The approach to Surrogance in itself makes for some great reflections on sloth and vanity and how we've become so enamored with what's \\"ideal,\\" as apparent by the setting and plot. But when moral dilemmas about the artificiality of life start surfacing, all sorts of friction can start to develop, which is essentially the kind of issues the film tries to discuss. However, with only an 88 minute run time the movie feels way too short and never really addresses the complexities as elaborately as it could. The screenplay also suffers from lack of development for Bruce Willis' character and never really has enough of a buildup to make said complexities feel as wholly riveting like, say, the more recent I,Robot. On the flip side, though, the movie still makes for decent entertainment with what it ends up being and only disappoints with its missed potential. This is the first Jonathan Mostow film I've seen at this point, so I didn't really know what to expect, but I have seen quite a few Bruce Willis movies and am happy with his continuing effort and exceptional acting ability for that \\"rugged, yet vulnerable kind of guy\\" archetype. James Cromwell doesn't play very big roles, but I've been a fan of his for a while and have always enjoyed his quaint and father-like subtlety as well. I also like Ving Rames, but seeing him with dreadlocks feels kind of silly. Good effort by Mostow.    Video - 4.0    Presented by Disney/Buena Vista in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.40) Surrogates looks good. I only say good because a big factor in reflecting the artificiality of Surrogance is the very smudgy skin textures present in about 90% of the people in the movie. Some could say it's an accurate transfer as per aesthetic intention, but it still feels like looking at a bunch of faces that were heavily DNR'd. Aside from that, though, everything else looks great. Colors are vibrant, if not a tad muted at times to coincide with the dystopic feel of the art direction. Black levels are inky, contrast is accurate, and detail is excellent on actual people not using Surrogates. Check out Willis' stubble when he's walking out and about.    Audio - 5.0    Unlike the somewhat underwhelming video presentation, the DTS-HD 5.1 track has no oddities in it whatsoever. Much of the film in the beginning is very dialogue-driven, but when action sequences start weaving themselves into the plot, sound effects really boom. Side speakers do an outstanding job moving the on-screen action from one side of the room to the other. High and low ends are accurate when need be and the music never feels overpowering. LFEs, however are the real treat. Gunshots, helicopters, and car crashes dominate the sound stage and really give your sub-woofer a workout adding a great sense of depth and realism to progressing urgency of the plot. There aren't a whole lot of action big sequences, unfortunately, but when there are they're reference material.    Extras - 3.0    Aside from the informative commentary by Mostow, the extra features don't amount to much else. In fact, I'd even say I'm a little angry at the main vignette and how it almost totally defeats the purpose of the movie. The \\"Science of Surrogates\\" feature spends nearly all of its time addressing real-world applications and the benefits of using technology to such an advanced level that we will inevitably develop and take advantage of it to the fullest. But for a film that just did the opposite and showed the disadvantages of such ideology, it boggles my mind why they'd suddenly contradict the entire point of the story and pretty much shrugit off at the end by saying \\"well, there ARE disadvantages, too [fade out]...,\\" which serves as another example of how the overall project just doesn't live up to its potential. The other features are a short look at the original graphic novel that the movie is based on, deleted scenes, and a music video by Breaking Benjamin (in HD and DD 5.1!) for the song \\"I Will Not Bow.\\"    Overall - 4.0    Of all the genres out there, I'd have to say science fiction is probably my favorite. It allows for so many questions to be asked and is also very easy for us to relate to today and as we advance further into the future. Surrogates has a very intriguing concept that possessed a lot of potential, but in the end feels exceedingly underwhelming with barely an hour and a half to explore the complexities and dilemmas mentioned in the film. But if you're in the mood for a quick-paced, sci-fi action thriller and are a fan of Bruce Willis, Surrogates may just provide enough with its presentable video and reference audio to make this a worthy addition to your collection. Viewers wanting a little more depth, though, would be wise to give this a rent first.

B00005JKG9|5.0|It is not often that a play can be so successfully made into a outstanding movie. David Mamet's play is made into a screenplay/movie with an outstanding cast and the actors performances are some of the best acting I've ever seen. This is a very interesting movie.     Mamet has a specific type of dialog, a syntax and overlapping type of dialog and interaction between the actors. In addition, Mamet and the actors intergrate the slang talk and slang terms that are unique to this type of sales work. The actors in this film capture this very well in the roles of commision salesmen.    The cast; Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin are all outstanding and turn in great performances.     Jon Green
B001I93I6U|5.0|Fantastic book.  Read the series.  However, warning, I have been waiting for the conclusion to this series for two years.  I know many of this fans have given up, but I still believe that he will complete this series - come on George!
B0009UC81A|5.0|The story line, the music and the age old musicians plus the comedy styles of Belushi and Aykroyd make this a timeless movie.

Twice the enjoyment factor plus the expanded version is great against the original theatrical version.
B00337KMAA|4.0|Movie - 5.0    It's really strange how a lot of my college classes in the past year have coincided with movies I end up watching. Right now, I'm taking a course on Civic Engagement & The Power of Social Capital, then another on Business Anthropology. Civic Engagement basically teaches us that society as a whole isn't what it used to be; people are more isolated these days, technology has made us inexplicably more distant from one another, and there just isn't much of a human connection anymore, at least like there used to be in generations past. Business Anthropology is about the concepts of change and difference and how things (be they in life or the business world) are always evolving and need to adapt over time. Enter: Up in the Air, an incredibly accurate testament and indicative measure of the times we're currently living in and the complications that come with it. It's a story about how we choose to live our lives and is backed by a very clever analogy in \\"The Empty Backpack.\\" Of all the material things we own and all the people we know and the baggage that comes with those relationships, do we really need to weigh ourselves down with that? Our dead-end jobs, friends, and family; is there really a point to having all of these and keeping them close outside of what cultural norms tell us we need? On the other hand, if we didn't engage with one another and actually socialize from time to time, humanity certainly wouldn't be as welcoming and we all probably wouldn't have those friends and family to share some of the happier moments with. I think this movie does a brilliant job with its script and screenplay showing both the benefits and hindrances of choosing between the two lifestyles. Until this semester, I would actually say I was somewhere in-between, but leaning closer to the loner side. However, with these classes and now the viewing of this fine movie, I'd say I'm stuck back in the middle again, but with no real preference. Moderation and balance are always a good thing, right? And with that said, kudos to Jason Reitman for a very poignant film and to George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick for some outstanding performances. Up in the Air may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those interested in a \\"ground-based\\" (there's an oxymoron), slice-of-life drama, that's also a great psychological and character study about how society works, this is definitely worth a watch.    Video - 5.0    Brought to you by Paramount in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, Up in the Air is as perfect a picture as you will find. Colors are vibrant from the very beginning of the opening credits sequence and throughout the entire movie, separating clothes, backgrounds, skin tones, hair, lighting, etc. Detail and textures are also very distinct between people and objects, most notably for me between George Clooney and the many suits he wears and the patterns on both his and everyone else's business attire. Black levels are deep, though not amazingly so given there are very few instances of pure pitch blackness. Contrast is also excellent and compliments the fine layer of grain for a remarkably theatrical feel. There are also zero instances of artifacting, debris, and image manipulation. It's not reference material in the sense of wowing your guests, but flawless is still flawless.    Audio - 4.5    Some may find it odd to give a dialogue-driven character drama a 4.5 for audio, but even with its limited sound design, this DTS-HD track is surprisingly ample. Dialogue is clear with no dropout or volume issues, and what few ambient sound effects there are resonate accordingly from the front and side speakers. But the star of the audio is the music, which really supports the film as a whole emanating profusely from all speakers and creating a subtle, if not melancholy, mood to help convey the story. The only element obviously lacking, though, are any real levels of LFE output. There's one scene during aparty that makes for some great bass in the on-screen music, but that's it.    Extras - 2.0    Armed with only a commentary track (a pretty good one) and deleted scenes (in HD, and also with good commentary), Up in the Air doesn't have much else aside from a couple of features about how they constructed the opening sequence and a storyboard comparison. I would really liked to have seen interviews from the rest of the staff, the author of the original book, or cast members about there thoughts on the film itself, but perhaps they thought the film wouldn't be as well-received enough, and hence, decided not to go through the trouble? That's a shame.    Overall - 4.0    While the extras are severely lacking, I'd still highly recommend this film for its outstanding story and A/V presentation. It's a story that I, personally, find very enduring and enjoyable thanks in part to its eloquent message about isolation, the benefits of companionship, the deteriorating affinity we have with one another, the impact of change, and just how important it is to see both sides of the coin when it comes to life. With outstanding direction and writing from Reitman, a subtle, yet fun script, exceptional performances by veterans Clooney and Farmiga, and a prominent job by Kendrick (who shows a lot of potential), Up in the Air is one of the finest character dramas I've seen in a while and should be one of the things you keep in your proverbial backpack.

B002MLYA0G|5.0|I just saw this on Amazon.com and had to reiterate what W.G. has stated.    This is the UK version of Let the Right One In, which due to it's commentary track from the director (Tomas Alfredson) and author (John Ajvide Lindqvist) of LTROI it is worth owning for any LTROI fan. However, there is no need to pay $40+ for this.    It easily available from amazon.co.uk. The check out process and shipping to US is simple, and you'll save a ton of money. It worked fine on my PS3, but like W.G. stated, the photo gallery did not work. However, I believe that it's the same photo gallery included on the U.S. DVD and BluRay versions.    For any LTROI fan it's definitely worth owning, but not for the cost listed here.

1439138311|5.0|Many reviewers have ably summarized the basic plot and themes of this book and I will not do so again. I will say only that I sat down to read it about 11:30 one night, thinking I would read a handful of pages and fall asleep. To my chagrin, it was 3 a.m. when I finally put it down, completed. I could not stop reading until I found out what happened.    But Brooklyn is not a page turner in any conventional sense: There are no murders, literary pyrotechnics, sinister albino monks, seductive vampires, etc. The only mystery here is the mystery of the human heart, and that was enough to keep me glued to the pages. Colm Toibin's extremely subtle manner of telling a story -- he seems more to just get out of the way and let the story be told, something that looks effortless but is quite the reverse -- is an accomplishment that becomes more impressive with each page.    Since reading The Master I have thought that Toibin is among the best writers alive today, and Brooklyn only confirms me in this belief.

0385341008|5.0|What a wonderful story.  I thought it might be strange to read a book that was all in the form of letters, but the story unfolds and the characters are so well developed that you feel like they are real.  The writing is witty, makes you chuckle to yourself.  At the same time, there are serious topics undertaken and a historical story told.  Wonderful, must read!
B00275EGWY|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent and I would see it again.  My father was an EOD man in the AF and I never realized the intensity of his job.  This movie kept me in suspense as I felt many emotions - anxiety, sadness, anger.  It was too real in some instances as I kept thinking of our military in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I don't remember this movie coming to the theaters where I live and I go to many.  I think sometimes if a movie is too close to home, they don't bring it, or if they do, it is for a very limited time.  Even though some have expressed that they don't think it was a very good movie, I disagree totally and like I said, would see it again.

0061914177|5.0|Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion by Gary Vaynerchuk is one of those books I see coming up repeatedly on blogs I follow and with people I follow on Twitter.  So, in order to find out why this book is so popular, I got a copy from our local library and gave it a quick read.  And at only 142 pages, it *is* a quick read.  But what Vaynerchuk has to say can, if taken to heart and practiced, make a significant difference in your life, career, and passion.<br /><br />Content:<br />Passion Is Everything; Success Is In Your DNA; Build Your Personal Brand; A Whole New World; Create Great Content; Choose Your Platform; Keep It Real... Very Real; Create Community - Digging Your Internet Trench; The Best Marketing Strategy Ever; Make the World Listen; Start Monetizing; Roll With It; Legacy Is Greater Than Currency; Conclusion - The Time Is Now, The Message Is Forever<br /><br />Vaynerchuk makes his case that due to the rise of social networking tools like blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and vidcasts/podcasts, anyone can take their passion and share it with others.  You can establish and build a personal \\"brand\\" that is uniquely yours.  Let's say that you are a cashier at a clothing store, but your real passion lies in photography.  When you start talking to others about that topic, your eyes light up and you could go on for hours.  If you are willing to take that passion and work very hard to share what you know with others, you can \\"crush it\\" in that area and draw an ever-increasing audience who are interested in the same thing.  And once you get an audience and traffic, dollars in the way of advertising and sponsors can shortly follow.  It's not a matter of just sticking a blog entry out every four or five days, though.  Vaynerchuk uses his own examples with his Wine Library TV site to show how passion, branding, and honesty translate into a community that looks to him for truthful and entertaining information about the world of wine.  While he does sell wine, the videos and writings are not all designed to sell his own merchandise or a particular brand.  Instead, he's looking to share his passion for the subject, knowing that people who come to him *will* likely come back again when they *do* want to buy something.<br /><br />From the technology side, Vaynerchuk does a good job in showing the power of the social media tools that are out there for you to use.  It costs nothing to set up a blog, a Facebook account, or a Twitter account.  The cost of entry to start this is nearly non-existent.  To create podcasts or vidcasts is almost as cheap, as the tools you need to get started can run you less than $200.  Once that's all in place, the only thing left is you.  He's the first to admit that the type of passion he's talking about is something that keeps you up until the wee hours of the morning, but it's something that you are ready to jump back into as soon as you wake up.  If you're willing to work that hard for something you love, you can turn your passion into your livelihood.<br /><br />Is this all realistic?  Yes, in my opinion it's all very possible.  Will *everyone* who attempts this be able to quit their day job and become wealthy doing what they love? No, but Vaynerchuk would argue that true happiness and passion isn't measured by a six figure paycheck.  Yeah, it'd be nice, and it does work that way for some.  But if you're doing something you love to do, you *can* make a big difference in your life and the lives of others.<br /><br />Crush It! is a bold statement, and Gary Vaynerchuk is a passionate, outspoken proponent for what you can do to turn your passion into your career.  You may not agree with him fully, or you may begin to see the seeds of your own rise from a job to an avocation, a life centered around something you're passionate about.  Either way, you'll have plenty to think about after reading his book.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borroweditings are not all designed to sell his own merchandise or a particular brand.  Instead, he's looking to share his passion for the subject, knowing that people who come to him *will* likely come back again when they *do* want to buy something.

Will *everyone* who attempts this be able to quit their day job and become wealthy doing what they love? No, but Vaynerchuk would argue that true happiness and passion isn't measured by a six figure paycheck.  Yeah, it'd be nice, and it does work that way for some.  But if you're doing something you love to do, you *can* make a big difference in your life and the lives of others.    Crush It! is a bold statement, and Gary Vaynerchuk is a passionate, outspoken proponent for what you can do to turn your passion into your career.  You may not agree with him fully, or you may begin to see the seeds of your own rise from a job to an avocation, a life centered around something you're passionate about.  Either way, you'll have plenty to think about after reading his book.    Disclosure:   Obtained From: Library   Payment: Borrowed
0385342039|5.0|\\"Twenties Girl\\" by Sophie Kinsella (author of \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\\" among others), is the story of Lara Lington and her great-aunt Sadie. The catch? Sadie is a ghost, and Lara barely knew her in life. Through Sadie's persistent haunting, Lara gets to know her--and in the process, learns quite a lot about herself.     We first meet Lara at Sadie's funeral. Sadie, 105, passed away recently, and Lara's parents pressure her to go to the funeral. Lara would rather be anywhere but at the boring funeral for an old lady she didn't know. Her desire to be elsewhere increases when she starts hearing a voice no one else can hear. She tries to escape, but Great Aunt Sadie's ghost won't leave her alone. To satisfy Sadie, Lara must stop the funeral in progress. This entails an accusation of murder. The ensuing hysteria is made more comic by Sadie nagging Lara to find Sadie's missing necklace--she won't leave without it.     In the process of searching for the special necklace, Lara learns just what a fascinating person her great aunt was, and learns how she wants to live. Sadie teaches Lara about relationships, having fun, and moving on. In the process, she leads Lara to step beyond her boundaries and live life fulfilled. And, this being Chick Lit, she finds The Man for her--who is not at all who she expected!    \\"Twenties Girl\\" was a fun and satisfying read. It took me 50 pages to really get into it, but it was worth it. The ending is more sweet than bitter, and I closed the book feeling like it had ended right.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great workout in a short amount of time!  I am only about 15 pounds overweight and I wanted to lose a few pounds and tone up.  However, after doing level one for a week, I developed bicep tendonitis in my left (weaker) arm from all the pushups.  I looked ahead to level 2 and 3 hoping to find exercises I could use to replace the pushups, but I saw more pushups and exercises in that same position.  I guess I will rest the arm for a few weeks and look for some exercises to subsitute for some of the pushups so that I can do the rest of the video.  Also, be very careful with your knees on all of the lunges and squats.
B00158K0S8|3.0|Patton Blu-Ray has absolutely superb picture and sound quality. I'm amazed they could do this to a 40-year-old movie. And it's spectacular in 2.35:1 on a big-screen TV.    But it took forever and was incredibly hard to load, even though my TV and Blu-Ray player are good and fairly new and I have no trouble playing other Blu-Ray DVDs. Once loaded, there was no way to bypass previews and interviews and go straight to the movie (though I was able to \\"scene-skip\\" through them). And every time I stopped the action for a minute or two (to answer the phone, say), when I returned, the movie was back at the beginning and I had to start all over, this time scene-skipping, fast-forwarding and fast-reversing back and forth to find my place. I finally resorted to just hitting PAUSE and trying to get back before it cut off. It was as if I was watching a pirated Korean version, though the box looks legit and I got this from Amazon.    BTW, the entire movie is on Disc 1. Disc 2 is nothing but \\"special features.\\" Neither box nor insert tell you that.  So when you reach the intermission, don't eject the disc and put in disc 2. Just hit the scene-skip button.
B001FB55LC|3.0|This movie was very intersting, however, I was extremely disgusted with the way Hollywood originally marketed it--as a thriller--in the previews leading up to its release.  I couldn't wait to see this movie when it first came out off that alone.  It was almost billed as a Fatal Attraction-esque movie from the previews alone: Widow becomes romantically entangled with her dead husband's brother only to find out that he isn't dead at all and they try to conceal their relationship until he discovers the truth and loses it.  On the flip, the movie was basically about a husband who is presumed dead after being a POW in Iraq, his fight for survival during that harrowing time, and his failed attempts to adjust once he finally comes home.  Only secondary to this is his brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) stepping in to be a father figure of sorts and the romantic sparks between he and his sister-in-law (Natalie Portman).  I came into the movie expecting to see one thing, but got something entirely different.<br /><br />What I got wasn't bad at all though only because of the caliber of acting.  Tobey Maguire in particular was so haunting that I was downright on the edge of my seat waiting to see that moment where he finally cracked and exploded.  Though the scene wasn't what you would expect if you let the previews fool you, it was very intense and built up nicely.  Another performance that left me in awe was the young lady who portrayed the eldest daughter.  The fire in her during that kitchen scene when she blurted out her view on the situation between her mother and uncle was magnificent; she had daggers in her eyes and was fuming, it was just beyond believeable to watch in my opinion.  Jake Gyllenhaal had his moments too, but he was his purest when he saved his character's brother from doing the unthinkable in the end.  I felt Natalie Portman's character didn't have much depth, and she was clearly overshadowed by Maguire and Gyllenhaal's performances.<br /><br />I would give it 4 stars, but again, I was disappointed at the slant the studio took just to get people into the theater.  Clearly the Academy took note of that as well, which is why its nominations didn't make it beyond the Golden Globes, which is sad because honestly this movie had a fighting chance had it just been presented as is.I was disappointed at the slant the studio took just to get people into the theater.

B002GJU54E|5.0|I stayed up all night--and laughed hysterically--reading this. Mix Stephanie with monkeys, and Plum Spooky is the result! It's hilarious (as Plums usually are) and fun to read. I woke up much less tense the next morning!    That said: it isn't as good as the first few Stephanie Plum books are. Honestly, the last several books have been less than fabulous. They're still funny and still worth reading, but a parts of the stories feel recycled. There are, after all, only so many ways you can blow up a car. I won't give up reading them yet, though--they still make me laugh, and that's worth the price.     Any time I need a good stress-relieving gut-busting laugh, I turn to Stephanie Plum.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|While I'm enjoying the music and the general change of pace from her prior albums, it is a pity to see yet another artist fall victim to the \\"loudness wars.\\"     For example, I'm listening to \\"Waiting\\" as I type. This is a relatively sedate song but it it still recorded so \\"hot\\" that the VU meters consistently pop right past 0 dB. That is silly. The opening song \\"Chasing Pirates\\" has a level of downright nasty distortion that pervades the whole thing.     Perhaps I'm revealing my age, but I just don't understand the attraction of compressed and overprocessed music. Maybe if this were Concrete Blonde or Flogging Molly, but Norah Jones?     However, that is one of the problems with any fad or fashion, whether music, TV or clothes. People think they have to follow the fad even if it makes no sense. How sad.
0061922315|5.0|This is a wonderful debut novel that will be a great book club selection. The first chapter is riveting. Right away, we meet Kavita, the impoverished mother from India whose first girl baby is taken from her; and her second daughter, Usha. Kavita bravely and selflessly walks miles to ensure the baby has a chance at life.      The novel follows Usha (renamed Asha) as she gets adopted by Somer, an American mom and her Indian husband.  Somer is another interesting character--she's a physician, infertile, and deals with a surprising range of emotions when she realizes she feels left out around her new daughter and husband.  The scenes of Somer going to India with her husband are both funny and heartbreaking. The author does such a good job of taking on the perspective of very different types of mothers.     Ultimately, the story tracks Asha and the life of Kavita's third child, a boy and spans 20 years, so we get to see Asha as a young woman, who returns to India and learns about her cultural heritage by meeting her grandmother. I really loved seeing Asha in India--you can almost smell it and taste it.  Between Kavita, Somer, Asha and her grandmother, there are a lot of mom issues to discuss. When I finished this book, I wanted to talk about it with everyone. Get your book club to pick this one; everyone will find something they like.     This novel is well written, is full of interesting women of all ages, and raises serious issues about motherhood, cross cultural adoption, marriage, parenting...I recommend it highly. Its a great book club selection.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Along with everyone else who purchases Susan's CD, I fell in love with her voice from the youtube videos. However, the songs on this CD do not seem to fit her voice. There are several jazz songs and most of the songs in general do not demand the power she is so capable of delivering. I hope she will do another CD with songs that match her talent.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|We used this for a 'Movie Night' for our Sunday School class on Valentine's Day evening.  There were lots of folks who said they had never seen it all the way through.  This is great entertainment!  I didn't remember the amount of humor that was in it.  The best thing I can say is....'play it again, Sam'!
B0035G9ABQ|1.0|Knowing that it took Damon Albarn 5 years to record the album, I expected it to be at least on par with their first two. One track (On Melancholy Hill) sounds as if it were by the band \\"Prozzak\\", another (White Flag) like Albarn's unlistenable \\"Monkey Journey to the West\\" album. I'm further let down by the fact that they are on record as saying this is their final album; but then again I guess it could get worse...    The only half-decent tracks are \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\", \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\", and \\"Some Kind of Nature\\"
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|As a graphic novel \\"Watchmen\\" is often cited as possibly/definitively the greatest graphic novel ever produced. A book with so mighty a reputation would require nothing short of a miracle to be translated successfully into a feature film.    While I do not believe in miracles I do believe that something very similar happened:  director Zack Snyder helmed just such a project, the end result being a film that is as true to the source material as one could realistically hope for. I consider this true to the point of committing what some might see as sacrilege by never again reading the graphic novel in favor of this cinematic experience.    Snyder's stylistic approach serves the story splendidly, often perfectly reproducing scenes from the acclaimed graphic novel not because the fans would demand it but because he obviously loves the book.    The cast--the entire cast, no exceptions--delivers performances true to their characters' graphic novel counterparts. Jackie Earle Haley is especially impressive in his role as Rorschach.    The film's atmosphere is established beautifully through scenery, an amazing score and an interesting song selection for the soundtrack--the final touch on what is without a doubt a solid and exciting film.    For the Ultimate Cut edition, a handful of sequences--often pieces of scenes already in the movie--and the previously left-out Tales of the Black Freighter are added to the already amazing theatrical cut. The extra scenes and bits further the fullness of the adaptation. The Black Freighter scenes can be jarring at first due to these sequences being animated, but this soon makes sense according to the following logic: The Black Freighter exists within the world of Watchmen as a comic book that is being read by a New York youth; while live-action would have been nice, animation makes sense a comic book can be thought of as a frame-by-frame cartoon wherein the reader fills in the between-the-panels action with his or her imagination, and thus animation resembles what most people see in their heads when reading comics. The dark and brooding nature of the Freighter sequences is well-rendered, with excellent voice work from Gerard Butler. The only problem here is the importance of the Freighter story might not be as evident without having read the graphic novel beforehand, as the graphic novel makes that importance more obvious.    Nevertheless, the Ultimate Cut completes Zack Snyder's vision of bringing the Watchmen in its entirety to film and is worth buying for that alone. However, this box set also includes a second disc of intriguing bonus features (some of which are set within the fictional world of the film and enhance the experience), a third disc containing a digital copy of the theatrical cut (which I find useless; I will likely replace this disc with the theatrical release dvd) and the 2-disc Complete Motion Comic, all within a nifty box.    It's a release more than worth its price tag. If I could give it six stars, as opposed to five, I would.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|I like this genre, full of special effects, suspense and soap opera. Ever since \\"The Guns of Navarone\\" ('61), when I was a mere child, I knew the good stuff was coming. It paid off. With the current rash of CGI stuff, I have to admit that I was entertained by the effects, and especially by a few good performances, especially Oliver Platt as the oily snake politician. As usual, John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor cannot disappoint. Good stuff also from Woody Harrelson, Amanda Peet, Tom McCarthy and Thandie Newton. I visited Chichen Itza a few weeks ago. The Mayan calendar ends on 12/21/12 but most people think it's only because that's when they gave up writing it, when the Toltecs took over and virtually destroyed that civilization. I had a problem with the sound recording, and a few other elements that make a good action film. Soap opera elements will always figure in to make a story to qualify the scenario. The only exception I can think of would be James Cameron's exhausting \\"Aliens\\", my favorite of all. \\"2012\\" didn't stink. But, at 2 ½ hours, there was more than was needed. Most of the best action sci-fi/disaster films have been long (Towering Inferno, etc.), and the script doesn't seem to matter. Having been to Rio, it was unsettling to see the statue of Christ on Corcovado being toppled. Not so much the White House.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Pro: Very portable amp, nice built quality, bass enhancing mode option, rechargeable battery, and it does increase the volume a little.    Con: Background noise.    Total waste of money. I am using TripleFi 10vi when testing this little amp.  For me, sound quality is the most important factor.  This is the case where all the great benefits are outweighed by a critical flaw.   If you don't care about sound clarity, this would be a 5-star product.
1439170045|5.0|I read this book just prior to my Mom being diagnosed with Alzheimers.  Looking back over the past 5 years or so I found this story to be right on target.  After researching this terrible disease and reading numerous books, Still Alice gave me insight of what my Mom was going through on a daily basis and, helped me see clearly what she was experiencing.  This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who has a loved one dealing with this dreaded disease.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Admittedly, this was going to be a guilty pleasure for me, but hearing is believing!  Much more than just another \\"singing cutie,\\" Taylor's band, writing ability and vocal talents all add up to a big hit.  Highly recommended!
B002QF31HQ|1.0|Just picked up this copy, to see how it is.  One of my all-time fave Yes albums, being the only one with Pat Moraz on keys (check out blazing Mini-Moog solo on \\"Sound Chaser\\" - one of the all-time great recorded synth solos).  I was swayed by \\"mastered from original tapes.\\"  Unfortunately, it must have been DIGITALLY (re)mastered, because all the tell-tale signs of digital mastering are present in abundance: flat, listless, lifeless, dull, one-dimensional sound.  The absolute opposite of everything analog.  Played on my Well-Tempered Amadeus table with Grado Statement cartridge; which makes clear almost any discernable strength and flaw.  And this pressing is fatally flawed; not worth the money.  Tragic pressing of a phenomenal album. :-(
B002UNMW7O|5.0|This was an excellent gift to Boondock fans. Everything I loved about the first film was in this movie.
B000OVLBGC|2.0|I watched this movie only by chance after first reading many eulogies it received among  reviewers.   As the theme developed and I began to enjoy the immediacy of the plot I slowly realized this wasn't quite the sensitive searching look back upon a failed social experiment I'd been led to believe.  As you would expect modern performers are convincing actors - I think the sharpness and no frills approach of modern TV drama has over the years lifted the profession anyway.  Can anyone imagine how long an temperamental Joan Crawford type of artist would last in today's climate!   The plot whilst rather transparent was adequate.  As it developed and later seemed to hinge upon the DDR suicide issue I could see the female lead was probably doomed - but then I remembered another real life suicide 'urban myth' from my younger days.  In those days Sweden was (somewhat irritating for certain quarters) successful in its social policies.  Its 'progressive' politicians with their caring 'populist' internal behavior and humane foreign approach won a great deal of admiration - after a while assertions started circulating in the media.  \\"Ah yes but\\"...suddenly it seemed they had the highest suicide ratings in the world - seemingly there was insufficient excitement in Swedish lives.  Boredom caused them to dive under buses, jump into rivers and hang themselves under bridges.   Hmmm!   I expected an intelligent and genuine examination of a top/down flawed new approach to Societies problems - a fllmic reversal of the many failed classic attempts over millennia to overthrow the stifling elites by revolt from below.  I'm afraid this movie is being hailed by the same people who convinced me that Obama saw things in a different light....his was a new approach....the tone is certainly different but nothing has altered.  'The lives of others' is yet another example - you've seen it before, nothing is changed it is just another predictably praised - I noticed for instance Wm Buckley and oneof the Podhoritz clan  - two of the foundling godfathers of the NeoCon mafia lauding it as 'The greatest movie I've ever seen' in one case and 'One of the greatest movies ever made in the other'.  We've been conned again I'm sorry to say it's just another 'Commie Bashing' production.   The movie was seen eventually on a business trip with a well known Airline - I am flying again a few weeks time and am look forward to a viewing of Michael Moores latest item 'Capitalism - a love story'.  Ahem....I'm sure it will be freely available.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Fabulous CD from an amazing show, with original cast recordings.  Even my young children love to sing along.
1590171993|5.0|This is a gentle, beautifully written, bittersweet story of Professor Stoner and the lives of those with whom he intersects.  Although we may become exasperated with him a times, we can't help but feel that we have known him intimately and feel his pain as he encounters personal loss and disappointments.  A quiet masterpiece of one person caught in the midst of a cultural shift.

B00003CXIP|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time, and I'm glad I found it. Everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time. I feel that everyone can relate to AT LEAST one of the characters AT LEAST once throughout the course of the movie. MUST SEE!
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Positive:  The animation/graphics were exceptional. Worth seeing the movie just for that reason.  Negatives:  (1.) Really bad science not only for the basic science of neutrinos and Earth core heating but for the subsequent movement of the Earth's crust and the quantity of water needed to cover Mt. Everest and most everywhere else.    (2.) Juvenile, contrived script & dialogue. If people really talked like they some writers want them to, especially in stressful conditions, we would think of them as clueless, numskull idiots.  (3.) Weak story with too many stolen-from-other-movies stereotypes, e.g. Russian fighter; divorced dad trying to entertain kids and ex-wife; female escort with mini-dog; crazy DJ (another bizarre and poor acting by Harrelson); government conspiracies and assassinations; pack the kids to escape the apocalypse; driving cars off of crashing airplanes in snow fields.
0743455967|5.0|Speaking as a non-fiction author (including books on how to write non-fiction) I heartily recommend you read this all-time classic by Stephen King. Why? Because as I suggested when recently I reviewed Jurgen Wolff's similarly entrancing book, the days of boring, stiff and uninviting \\"text books\\" are well and truly over. Non-fiction writers of the 21st century need to learn almost as much about drama, story-telling and entertainment in their writing as the novelist does, because now if you're going to hold your non-fiction readers' attention you need to entertain as well as inform and educate. They're getting picky, and I don't blame them. Why should they be bored by dry, tedious text? So let's learn from Stephen and other wizards like him, and deliver non-fiction that really gets to people's hearts.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I've always liked Gorillaz. Their previous singles were amazing, but, I always found myself skipping tracks for both the self titled and Demon Days. Still, those albums came to be one of my favorites of the past decade.    That being said, I've been listening to this album for quite some time now. First of all, there is not a single song that you can say \\"This song is the Feel Good Inc. or Clint Eastwood of the album\\". But, every single song in this album is fantastic. Some more than others. It has been some time since I could listen to an album from start to finish without skipping a single track. The wait is over.    Key tracks: \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\", \\"Stylo\\" , \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\", \\"Empire Ants\\", \\"Some Kind of Nature\\", \\"On Melancholy Hill\\"
6305278016|5.0|Besides the incredible performance delivered both by the American actors and the Japanese ones, this is the kind of movie that should be considered as \\"cult\\". If you ever wandered by Japanese streets and places you will feel exactly like Michael \\"Nick\\" Douglas and Andy \\"Charlie\\" Garcia: talking to native Japanese people is almost impossible, either because they do not really speak any other language or because they pretend not to. The Japanese society is a close kind of environment and \\"gaijin\\" people are not welcome if they intend to be anything else than tourists.  Black Rain is a fantastic movie and you need to watch it many times so as to capture all the details it contains in the many aspects of its production.

0385737424|5.0|This book is the most sensitive book I have read in a long time. The writing is graceful, even poetic at times.      This book deals gently with some difficult topics - class and race differences, safety in a city, a single parent in a relationship - without being an \\"issue\\" book.  These many things swirl around main character Miranda's life just as they swirl around the lives of children.      The book also deals with the loss of someone's friendship with a true depth of knowing.  When reading this book, I was reminded of the profound sense of loss one feels as a young person coexisting in school with someone who used to be a friend.      Yet with all its sensitivity, this book is an action packed, fantasy page turner.  Even after I finished, I couldn't put it down - I had to go back and begin all over again.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I bought this CD of Billy Joel's after attending one of the Face2Face concerts he gave with Elton John. Talk about a concert!! Anyway, I'd had the old cassette tape of Billy's album years ago, and loved the selection of songs. So I bought this CD in order to be able to hear it somewhere besides our 1997 car with the tape player.... He sounds so young on it (which he was), and several of the songs have become real classics. Buy it if you want a blast from the past.
0743497465|1.0|I am not sure how else to describe this book.  I listened to it while driving to and from work on my mp3 player and found myself rolling my eyes at the preposterous turns and twists of the plot more often than I kept them on the road.  Its a quite dangerous book in that way.  I understand that there is a place for fantasy in fictional writing.  But Dan Brawn's fantasy in this case is so far fetched and so poorly thought through, it is hard to imagine that the action actually happens here, on Earth.<br />There is hardly a scene or an event in this book that is plausible.  As more and more scientists and high tanking officials get killed or disappear in a span of several hours - you start to wonder - how can that stay unnoticed?  Wouldn't people be looking for them?  Is this a way to hide the truth by killing every single prominent figure that comes in contact with it?  And what about great many people and resources that had to have been involved in setting the whole deception up?  And how about blowing up a limo carrying a top-ranking government official with a missile fired off a helicopter in the middle of Washington DC?  Surely everyone will attribute the accident to poor quality of DC roads and probably the unusually large pothole that caused a car to explode... or perhaps to a terrorist hiding in the shadows of FDR Memorial with a Hellfire missile.<br /><br />The book denies even the slightest desire for common sense and realism to its reader.  The only reason I kept on listening until the end of the book, is my curiosity to see what new nonsense will the author throw at the reader next.  And to be honest - Dan Brown did not disappoint! :)

0061719544|4.0|You may recognize Ferguson from The Drew Carry Show or The Late Late Show with Craig. This is his life story, from a boyhood in Glasgow to a brief stink in New York and eventually to L.A. Craig recalls his drunken escapades in a way only a now sober comedian can. He pokes fun at his own previous stupidity and life choices, recognizes his own faults and his role in the failure of his relationships. Through all these recollections Ferguson manages to be hilarious and insightful. Underneath all of the drugs and alcohol it is really a story of a boy who just wanted to live in America. He made me both proud of my country and a little sadness that myself and many others forget that it can be more than political rivalries and shouting matches. You don't have to be a huge fan to find his story entertaining, and his personal growth is moving. This isn't exactly high brow literature, but it's fast paced and entertaining.
0307454541|5.0|The depth and detail in the book is exceptional.  The mystery was so well developed and the various angles were linked.  Flowing from beginning to end without that typical brief wrap up in the last few chapters.  Well written and very interesting.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief, which is narrated by Death, is the story of Liesel as she lives goes to live with her foster family just prior to and during World War II. The story centers around Liesel learning to read, making friends, growing up, and dealing with the effect World War II has on her foster family in friends. She is a girl who lives through nothing but tragedy but still has an open heart and clear head on her shoulders, well, at least most of the time.     After hearing so much about The Book Thief over the past year I decided I could not put off reading it any longer. I was completely blown away by this exquisite novel. I went in expecting something very YA, but still enjoyable and was surprised by how mature everything was. Death as the narrator gives insight into characters and situations that would be impossible to disclose otherwise, as well as keeping the overall mood of the book somber as he is always reminding the reader of the impending doom that Liesel's family and friend will face.     I think every book lover can relate to Liesel, not in a suffering in Nazi Germany way, but in a word transporting way. Her books are the most important things she owns, they are gifts from family, made by friends and stolen from fires and private library's.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|... and perhaps a rather disappointing one, in that our \\"glimpse\\" is a rather \\"surface\\", shallow one. Although... it must be said that this is probably a must-see film for anyone even moderately interesed in fashion and/or publishing, given that Ms.Wintour has held the helm of this greatest fashion bible for twenty years; I, however, expected much more.    And, I am very surprised that none of the other Amamzon-folk mention that the fashionistas appearing in this movie wore some of the most questionable outfits imaginable... did they forget that the cameras were rolling???... did they not see TheDevilWearsPrada??? Even Ms.Wintour, herself, \\"graced\\" the screen with some ensembles created of at-odds combinations of seemingly mismatched separates; did she look in the mirror before leaving her house?    I expected someone more dynamic, a person larger than life... instead, we get a rather inward-looking and \\"still\\" beige woman, walking... at least figuratively, with shoulders-forward rather than with shoulders-back, and with a hairsytle needing to be re-thought so as to show her face;  where was the fabulous-ness???, though one certainly must acknowledge these past twenty years at the VOGUE-helm... as well as her focused, assured intensity as she made SeptemberIssue-related decisions... in this, an industry taking no prisoners... she has survived and prevailed.      Well, at least Andre Leon Talley is always lots of fun!     Paging Ms.Diana Vreeland's FABULOUS RED!!!

B0027DK206|5.0|This is super easy to use and put on your Diana camera. I went through about half a roll of the instant film trying to get the lighting just right which was lame since it's so expensive but it's so much fun to take the pictures and at a party it's a blast.  I lost one photo forgetting to put on the lens piece so don't forget to actually follow the directions.  In the end, it works really great and people love to have their picture taken with it.
B000TFINY6|5.0|This season gives many questions but is still a good telling of an ongoing story.  Can't wait to pick up the fourth season.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This story like his other films are dead on and in your face as well as the faces of the powers that be. He continues to shine the light on what is wrong with this country. He does not tell you to agree with him, he merely shows the facts and leaves the decision up to you. It is through this introspection that you are able to truly see what kind of person you are. While other filmmakers entertain us with snappy dialogue, special effects and breath-taking cinematography, Mr. Moore takes you on a journey of human emotion and of truth. He is possibly the world's greatest whistle-blower and the most important filmmaker of the 21st century. I urge the people of influence to get the voters together to watch this film as well as Sicko and Fahrenheit 9/11 when election seasons roll around again. We cannot afford to forget about the facts that have been presented to us or we will continue to get more of the same from these politicians.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|I found this movie by accidedent ,browsing around at period movies, and bought it cause I like Viggo. After \\"LOTR\\" I started looking at some of his other movies realizing he is a pretty good actor. I was not let down by \\"Alatriste.\\" Viggo plays the title charactor, a Spanish mercenary in the 17th century. There ia a lot going on in this movie and a lot of the reviewers complained about this, but I like the movie alot. Being in Spanish with subtitles did not detract at all from the story. There is action, romance and a real grittiness to this film. It also touches on some real historic events, wars in Flanders and against France. There are two love stories going on. Alatriste's love is a married actress who doesn't seem to really care for anyone and her retribution for this fits the crime. The other love story is the son of a friend of Alatriste's who was killed and Alatriste promised to take care of to the dying man. You can't quite be sure if this man's lover is sincere either. Viggo plays his charactor with very real emotions going from cold hearted mercenary to revenge seeking, then sypathetic regretful ex-lover. I was glad I took a chance on this film after reading some of the negative reviews. I never read the books so I don't know how it compares. I collect movies with period themes and especially this type and I'd put this in my list of ones to watch over again along with the series \\"The Tudors.\\"
1400096936|5.0|The Power of the Dog is by far one of my favorite books.  Well written.  Great story and characters.  First time in a long time that I couldn't put a book down.  Since reading this book, I have read all of Don Winslow books (excluding older mystery novels) and have yet to be disappointed.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Excellent DVD....really gets you up close and personal with this quirky and interesting musician. Loved the music!
B001RIY4WE|4.0|The reason i'm rating this as 4 stars is because i never got to see it! but from all other reviews it seems to be the best out so far..    While you would think that when buying an item from Amazon full info on the product would be available. Well, you'd be mistaken..    In my case, and this product, The region of the Blu ray is not mentioned, which made me mistake it for a region free one, when it's not. So now i got one of the biggest blockbusters of all time and the latest blu ray edition till this time sitting on the shelve of my living room because i cannot play it!! and the worse part... there are no region free or region A Blu ray players were i am!     Therefore i suggest you bear in mind that T2: The Skynet Edition Blu ray is only available in REGION A. If you are living abroad and own a PAL PS3 (Region B) like i do or a Blu ray player of anything different than region A, make sure you find an alternative way because there is no way this disc will play on your system!    I'm gonna go now and stare at the cover of my Blu ray again :S
1400032717|2.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time began beautifully. The mystery of who killed a dog, shown through the eyes of a 15-year-old autistic boy, was more intriguing and entertaining than most of today's generic amateur sleuth mysteries. Written in an easy to read format with helpful diagrams, this book appeared to be an interesting tale that could perhaps shine a little light on the thought processes of autistic teenagers.<br /><br />About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer confesses and then entire focus of the story shifted. Instead of a mystery, it became a rambling tale of running away from home. It went from engrossing to dull in the turn of a page. With the story switching gears so unexpectedly, it felt as though the book was in fact two separate stories (featuring common characters) pasted together to create a book. It felt off, like something just wasn't fitting properly.<br /><br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time's quirky uniqueness didn't translate through the second half of the book. This was a case of an amazing book turning dreary. Had the entire book been dull, it might almost have been better.
020530902X|5.0|I was thinking about starting an editing business out of my home, so I purchased this with that in mind.  Well, I never did get around to editing, but I still read and re-read this book -- many times.  In fact, both my adult children bought copies for themselves.  One was in college at the time, the other just enjoyed the book enough to want a copy for herself.<br /><br />This is a great book that would make a fantastic gift for a high-schooler, or someone in college, as well as the linguist in your life.<br /><br />My copy is now dogeared, and very much worn.  It is time I bought another copy for myself.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while!  While short, it is packed full of wisdom!  Excellent Read and quite inspirational!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Watch this film, period. Michael Moore has once again taken things that many of us just suspected instictively and provided the cold, hard facts. It's frank and it's very unsettling, but the message contained in this film is so vital to this country right now. If for nothing else, watch this movie for the segment on FDR's proposed Second Bill of Rights, which, had they been enacted would have made this country into a much better place than what we are witnessing right now.<br /><br />I am all for difference of opinion, but regarding the message in this film, anyone who is a detractor is part of the problem.

B00328G4V6|4.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers that it's doubtful that this was Jimi's \\"final vision \\" of an album.  But boy-oh-boy this is some great Jimi Hendrix jam and I think we get hints of where he was going(although we'll never know).  Well worth the money to hear Jimi's searing guitar licks and quiet blues mastery. If you're on the fence about buying it or afraid this will somehow not measure up, rest assured this is a welcome addition to anyone who loves blues-rock, BUY IT or download it , you won't be sorry.  (Red House alone is worth the price)      That being said, I remain angry at him for leaving us so needlessly.  God only knows what he had in store for us that we'll never get to hear.  And for that I'm am sad.      Enjoy!

B0026P3G12|4.0|After all the hoopla surrounding Susan Boyle's appearance on television and her subsequent dustup with the media, it was nice to here a woman with a mature voice singing an eclectic mix of music that SHE likes. A very pleasant listening experience.

B0039W1J0Q|4.0|An album of covers--especially from a top-notch songwriter like Peter Gabriel--might seem like a cop out (why not write new material?), but I think this album works very well on two levels.    First, a successful cover should make you hear a song in a completely new and unexpected way. Gabriel's moody renditions of these songs give each of them plenty of room to breathe, so that lyrics that might have rushed by unnoticed in the original here linger and resonate in new ways.  The best example of this is probably Paul Simon's \\"The Boy in the Bubble,\\" a song I've heard many, many times on the radio and yet, somehow, never really listened to prior to hearing this CD. The combination of Gabriel's vocals and John Metcalfe's atmospheric arrangements transforms Simon's upbeat pop song into a haunting meditation more fitting to the rather dark lyrics.    Second, the arrangements showcase Gabriel's distinctive voice.  Without drums and guitars, a lot of space is given to the vocal in these songs, and the vocals themselves are recorded in a very intimate way.  There are times when his emotions are right on the surface, as on \\"Heroes,\\" where it sounds as though he is on the verge of tears about halfway into the song. This might sound hokey in someone else's hands, but Gabriel's voice still has the gravitas to make us share what he feels in delivering the song.    Four stars for song selection, because not every number is a winner.  I thought the Radiohead cover, for example, was somewhat lackluster--and probably added just so Gabriel could get Thom Yorke on board to cover one of his own songs.  But on the whole I would recommend this CD for Gabriel fans.  You won't be disappointed.    The only other cover album I can think of that approaches this one in atmosphere is Marianne Faithfull's \\"Strange Weather,\\" which, if you like this, you might want to also check out. [[ASIN:B000001FU0 Strange Weather]]
0670021652|4.0|Liz returns with the story of why and how she marries Felipe.  They had vowed to spend their lives together but without getting married because they had both been through difficult divorces.  Gilbert relates tons of information on the history of marriage and different cultural views on marriage.  She shares some very personal information about the marriages of her mother and grandmother.  This book is not as funny as \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" but was still very enjoyable.
1582701709|4.0|The Secret   Do you want to lose weight?  Have a great love life?  Be successful in your job?  Get rick quickly?  According to Rhonda Byrne, we can all have everything we want, by living the rules of life, given to us in her novel ¬The Secret.  The Secret was written in 2006, and has become a worldwide phenomenon.  With Oprah as a supporter and testimony giver of the realness of the secret, people all over the world are reading, and trying to learn how they too, can have all the things they have ever wanted in life.   In her book, Byrne focuses on teaching the reader about the power of the mind.  She explains that with constant positive thought, we can steer our lives in the direction that we want them to go.  She believes and teaches that humans are eternal energies, constantly emitting and attracting energy, whether it is good or bad.  The book teaches the reader that by focusing on only the good things in our lives, and the good around us, we will only attract good.  She explains that thinking bad thoughts about others or about situations does nothing to hurt others, but it in turn, attracts negative energy towards us.  Through the power of thought, Byrne attests \\"There isn't a single thing that you cannot do with this knowledge. . . . The Secret can give you whatever you want\\" (p. 11).   The Secret gives many examples of how living this way of thinking has helped many people throughout history.  Byrnes herself came across the secret to life, when she was having a hard time in her life.  She began practicing positive thought, and began willing good things her way.  After many instances of her positive thoughts coming true, she began to write down her experiences.  These written experiences have transcended into the phenomenon that is \\"The Secret.\\"   This book has been very helpful to me in my life.  Not only in attaining the things I want to attain within my family and my business, but also to help me live a happier life.  With the help of this book, I havelearned to become more \\"Zen\\" and less stressed out in daily life.  This in turn has helped me to become a better father and husband.     Don't get me wrong, I did not agree with everything Byrne teaches in the Secret.  From a religious standpoint, I find some of what she writes to be very blasphemous and sacrilegious.  She claims that we should thank ourselves daily for our lives, where I feel we should thank our Father in Heaven for our lives.  On page 164, Byrne states \\"You are God in a physical body. You are Spirit in the flesh. You are Eternal Life expressing itself as You. You are a cosmic being. You are all power. You are all wisdom. You are all intelligence. You are perfection. You are magnificence. You are the creator, and you are creating the creation of You on this planet.\\"  I struggled with some of the contradictions to my beliefs that were listed in this book, but was able to change the wording in my head, to fit my own beliefs as I read it.     Despite the contradictions to my religious beliefs, I feel that there is something to be said for positive thinking.  The Secret, if followed closely, and practiced, truly can change your life.  I have become a better family member, a better business owner, and a better friend, because of the secret.  I would recommend reading this book to learn how you can have money, friends, and success, when and how you want it.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade's new release is hypnotic and compelling; I have been listening to this CD over and over since it arrived, and I love it.  It is not easy to peg--it's not cool jazz, exactly, and definitely not folk, pop or rock; it's just Sade doing something really unique and expressive.  It's so dreamy, so easy to listen to, and so touching; a unique vision.  Highly recommended!
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|The Zefal Spy Mirror is the most functional mirror I've tried. Very versatile mounting system and I find the image nearly vibration free. Useful if you don't like helmet mirrors or have bars suitable for bar end mirrors. Depending on your bar, may require a bit of experimentation to find the right spot, and may need a diy extension. I created one using a dowel and hose clamp.

B00328G4V6|5.0|The new Jimi is really amazing and unbelievable, quite possibly, arguably his best recordings EVER...    The mix and sound quality is incredible. Mitch Mitchell's drumming- phenominal, all the chops AND groove.    Bleeding Heart (Elmore James) is my favorite.    I listened to the whole disc twice (62.02), it was that good of a listening EXPERIENCE.    First 3 songs are with Billy Cox on the bass, and for all the tension and discontent between Noel and Jimi, Noel does a really good job of laying down some great bass parts throughout.    And really, some, most of us have been experienced, but when you listen to some of these tunes -you will hear some of the best lead guitar playing Jimi has ever done. Really.      So, so Happy - Real Music
B001FB4W0W|1.0|These shows are complete TRASH!  I have enjoyed reading all the Sookie Stackhouse novels, so I got the entire first season thinking I would really enjoy it.  I was disgusted with what I was given.  Sorry, people...from start to, I'm guessing, finish these are completely revolting.  I didn't make it past episode 4...I was too sick to my stomach.
B00005JLD4|5.0|An absolutely stunning movie-- moving beyond words .  It kept me tied to my seat, and the performances of every single actor and actress were marvelous-- including the children, who were absolutely stellar.  If ever I could say I am so glad I saw a film, this is the time.     My hat's off once again to Kenneth Branagh, my all-time favourite actor, for choosing to be part of this amazing story which needed to be told.    That such things were happening in Australia as late as 1970 is staggering.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This brilliant film, full of magnificent performances, does not preach, but will pierce the hardest heart.<br />I extend my deepest appreciation to Mr. Hallstrom, Richard Gere, Joan Allen, and the Akita trainers for bringing this unforgettable story into my home, where it will be enjoyed again, and again.<br />My wife, who NEVER comments on a movie, said \\"That was one of the best movies I have ever seen.\\"<br />Our 14-year-old Beagle usually rests in one place for ten minutes and moves to another spot in the room. While we watched HACHI, she remained between us on the sofa for the entire movie. She sensed our contentedness and rose only to lick our faces during the film's powerful emotional scenes.<br />Kudos to Mr. Gere for his diligence in making his relationship with the dogs feel genuine...and for the most amazing death scene I have ever witnessed portrayed in a film.<br />Since the real HACHIKO died in 1934, this film was long overdue, but more than worth the wait.
B002RT69QQ|1.0|I purchased this reader from another company for less than $7, no tax no shipping.  Kingston products are usually so reliable, I was completely surprised that it is a piece of rickety junk.  I tested it and it works, but I wouldn't expect it to last very long.  I was planning to recommend it to a friend of mine who needs this product, but after receiving it, I would not do that.  I'm glad I didn't spend very much money for it.  It would have been great if it was better built.

0062513346|5.0|As usual with Coelho's books, I felt a little lost when reading this. I suppose this is because he writes about the mysteries of life and I can't predict where his journey will take me.<br /><br />I'd say more about this book but I'd be addressing the plot and not the intent. I think this book can only be evaluated by each person's individual experience.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I was very disappointed with this film. If you enjoy watching people disarm bombs, then you may enjoy the movie. However there was no plot, it was very slow and boring, and not realistic to true life. (The things the main character \\"Will\\" does would never be tolerated--he's so out of control I wouldn't be surprised if he was court martialed for his actions if he did it in real life) This film pretty much takes you from one scene to another with no explanation as to where they are, how they got there, why they are there, and what they are doing. Also, was it really necessary to have the F word in every other sentence? I realize some soldiers can get a little graphic with their language at times, but it really wasn't needed in the film--especially with the frequency they used the F word in particular. If you like war pictures, but like for them to have a plot and make sense, then I would suggest you pass this one up and look elsewhere. Big hype over nothing and a major waste of time.
006621131X|3.0|This was definitely an interesting read. Smith is a good writer of prose. But her name dropping gets quite tedious, and a lot of what she writes is, quite literally, unbelievable. There are degrees of plausibility. It's one thing for her to suggest that she came up with Janis Joplin's nickname Pearl and quite another for her to recount watching the Bobby Kennedy assassination live on TV. The former seems too self-serving to be true (and this book is self-serving), but the latter is easily proven false (it wasn't broadcast). I ended the book feeling I had no idea what had actually happened and what had not. The result is I'm now reading a real biography of Mapplethorpe. Read Just Kids for an account of Smith's feelings, not of what really happened.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|I loved this film in every way. I loved the music, the visuals, the 3D when I saw it in theaters, and the story, among other things. I'm a big Pixar fan, but I'm only really writing this review because Amazon seems to want me to. You should definitely buy this DVD. It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature (a bit of a mistake to be in both, in some ways), best Sound Editing, and Best Musical Score.
0380799006|5.0|This book, along with the equally helpful (and cumbersomely titled) How To Talk So Kids Will Listen And Listen So Kids Will Talk, are the two parenting books that I recommend time and again.  They are, to my mind, brilliant works that ACTUALLY WORK.  They have brought me sanity (along with the feeling some days that I'm actually doing a decent job at this parenting gig) in own life, and a far more peaceful home.  I open both of them at random on a regular basis, and never fail to be reminded of something useful.<br /><br />My husband, not one to read parenting manuals, has even read this book and agrees it is logical and \\"surprisingly effective.\\"<br /><br />Overall, I honestly believe this book, along with How To Talk, can help you and your children achieve happy, healthy relationships that encourage cooperation and foster loving feelings -- rather than providing a set of authoritarian and/or punitive rules that at best only elicit the hoped-for behavior in the short term.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Ugh... wow. Where do I begin?    For starters... the Gorillaz have transformed from an alt-rock type band, to being an electronic/hip-hop/funky alternative band  with just as much following on the Comic Book/DVD type stuff. But now, it is almost night and day - where they are now, compared to where they began. From Del the Funkee Homosapien, to Danger Mouse and MF Doom, Damon's side project of The Good, The Bad, and the Queen, and now Snoop Dogg and Mos Def??!! WOW! They are truly a work in progress, but it is great to see them push the envelope.    The new album cover, extra inserts, and online media/story are almost worth the purchase price alone.     The album is way different than Deamon Days, so be prepared. They are now dabbling in more electronic (\\"Electric is the love\\"), more of an orchestra ensemble, and a very different and less heard of cast of guest characters. Still though... it is the Gorillaz!!    Snoop Dogg's appearance is a bit overrated. But Damon Albarn comes in on the 4th song with an interesting tune that reminds me of a modern day \\"Stop the Dams\\" or \\"Man Research.\\" It might take a while to grow on me like those songs, but I like it thus far. \\"Stylo\\" makes me think of the original Gorillaz album, but they get right back to Deamon Day ways with \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" featuring De La Soul. \\"Empire Ants\\" gets interesting towards the end of the song, but if it loses your interest then \\"Glitter Freeze\\" will hold it - and your speakers too. I haven't figured out \\"Some Kind of Nature\\" yet, but that one might grow on me too.    \\"Sweepstakes\\" featuring Mos Def might be the best song on the album. And \\"To Binge\\" sounds like it should have been on The Good, The Bad, & The Queen's album.     Lastly, \\"Pirate Jet\\" leaves you wondering where they will go next. \\"It's all good news now / because we left the taps / running... for 100 years.\\"    My review a month from now will probably be completely different. That is what's so great.

B002S0OBN2|3.0|Ok, so this is the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Amazon - however, I've really valued the reviews I find.    Let me preface by saying, like many other that will post/review here, that I am a LONG time Phantom fan.  I have seen the show 26 times (on Broadway and a variety of road shows).  I'm probably the only person that can actually claim to have stolen a Phantom Mask (it was Jeff Keller's first mask - one that I returned to Kevin Gray back in the early 90's).    I enjoyed the movie remake of the show - but was very dissapointed with Gerald Butler.  He wasn't awful - but God, he trashed the end of the title track IMO.  Music of the Night, my favorite song from that show, well - sigh, wish they would have picked a singer that could act rather than an actor that could sing.    But, alas, this is a review of Love Never Dies.    Overall, I \\"enjoyed\\" it (hesitant to say \\"like\\" yet).  After listening to about 3/4 of disc 1 and listening to the \\"rock\\" track of \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" I had to walk away from it and was extremely dissapointed.  However, after sitting down and listening to it through, I found myself enjoying it a little more.    The two issues I had with it was:    a)  The Coney Island stuff in the beginning (albeit good and catchy) made me feel like I was listening to a Disney flick (ie Beauty and the Beast or Hunchback of Notre Dame) where they have their beginning \\"crowd\\" pieces.  It didn't have the \\"feeling\\" at all of what I thought would be a sequel to Phantom - but, again, it seems to be wearing on me.  b)  THIS IS HUGE.  I have a VERY hard time with Gustav in \\"The Beauty Underneath\\"  I mean, in Phantom, the title track - where the Phantom and Christine are descending into the depths - they are entranced with one another.  In \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" it felt like ... I hate to say it ... (PLEASE tell me if I'm the only one) .. it felt like the Phantom had a thing for Gustav - and vice versa.  The moaning of \\"YES\\" by Gustav - .... it just felt very weird and odd - very out of place.  I realize Gustav is his son - and think I feel where he was going with this - but it just is SO hard to get over Gustav's moaning - as they sing \\"The Beauty Underneath\\".    I wanted/want SO badly to love this - but have a VERY hard time right now - mainly because of my second point above.  Also, unlike others perhaps, I really wish there were more undertones from the original in this piece.  I mean, in ALW's commentary, he states that the problem he had in developing the story is that he found he needed to go back to the original characters that we knew and loved.  Why didn't he pay attention to his own advice with the music.  I'm not looking for a rehash of the old - but, man - I just wish there was more of a trek down memory lane.    I, also, believe the Raoul in this production has changed TOO much!!  No more to say about that.    I don't know - perhaps after another week or two - I might feel obliged to rate this higher.  Perhaps if I ever get to see the show - it might also help - but, with Phantom, I feel in love with the music well before I saw the show.    My last point I'll make, is that, with Phantom - and many other shows, there are many catchy songs I find myself really loving and enjoying.  I really only find myself falling for \\"Til I hear you sing,\\" those songs that revolve around the Coney Island Waltz - and then the one where they sing with Meg (can't remember the song) - where it is very similar to Prima Dona.    Overall, like I said, I enjoy it - but need to listen to it a few more times.  I realize that my review keeps pointing to Phantom - but, come on - this is a Phantom \\"sequel\\" -     Sincerely,  Rob

1400052173|4.0|I have only read the reviews, trying to decide if I want to read this book.     I think I need to read the book just to make sure the author makes a note that cells are no longer used for research without a patient's permission (from the reviews, it sounds like this bit of info is missing).        'paying' for a patient's contribution is not even close to being practical.  First of all, turning a cancer biopsy into a cell line isn't a sure thing.  Many stop growing after a few passages and won't survie in cell culture. Second of all, the researchers themselves are not making money off of those contributions. If a cell line does become useful and is made available commercially,  patient privacy (HIPAA laws) prevent anyone from being able to connect that cell line to the original patient.

0156034026|3.0|Moshid Hamid's book is a smoothly written tribute to the quality of his education at Princeton, but while it is at once enthralling and always entertaining, it fails to achieve the hallmarks of good literature.  This is because it is basically a political tome rather than a serious attempt to illuminate the complexities of human nature or life in general.  It is merely what it is: an attempt to explain the conflicted attitudes of a privileged Pakistani-American who ultimately recognizes the fact that his esteemed position in an enviable American global enterprise and his love affair with a rich American, are the results of his own arrogance, not unlike that of the typically ambitious and materialistic American.  What propelled him out of the declining city of Lahore, was a desire to be somebody, to attain the American Dream, and for a time he pursues that goal with a determination akin to Gatsby.  It is only after his rejection by a beautiful patrician American girl and her family and his realization that despite his success he is not really an insider in his profession either, that he withdraws to Lahore and becomes a \\"reluctant\\" fundamentalist.  Whether his status is \\"reluctant\\" or the result of his anger at America and his rejection by the society that initially anointed him, is for the reader to decide.<br /><br />It is as if Hamid had two books to write, and so he deftly leads us through the titillating experience with a self-absorbed, beautiful young woman, a classmate at Princeton.  This part of the book is captivating and suspenseful as the reader watches Changze's tentative journey through the society life of New York City.  Erica, whose beauty belies a troubled mind, uses Changze to deflect a deep-seated depression over her lover's death and an increasing obsession with death itself.  As she spirals downward in her suicidal inclination, she regards Changze as her redeemer until she realizes that he cannot help her; no one can.  She is the pampered American, so narcissistic and shallow despite her world-class education that she comes to represent for him all that is wrong with America.  Certainly not to his credit, he then forsakes all hope America seemed to offer and takes up his sword against the vast global enemy of timeless values inherent in the Pakistani way of life.  He becomes a \\"reluctant\\" fundamentalist, a clandestine operative, a professor who leads activists in a jihad against America.  Once into this part of the book, the reader senses a formulaic approach that is predictable and somewhat shallow.  Reading the newspapers could impart this perception to anyone who is interested, but Hamid employs accomplished dialogue and passages of anger to accomplish his dialectic.  It is an interesting approach but lacking in depth and originality: a political tome, as I said, rather than an illuminating piece of \\"literature.\\"<br /><br />The book is derivative of Dostoyevsky's \\"Notes from Underground.\\"  The mocking voice, the antithetical statements, the pessimism, the ironic observations are all reminiscent of Dostoyevskian rhetoric, as is the fearful reaction of the listener, an American operative being led to his slaughter by the angry Changez.  In a dark restaurant in Lahore, Changze proceeds to tell the American operative about his acceptance at Princeton, his hapless love affair, his disillusionment with his job and Americans in general and suggests the plight of the suspicious American, who keeps glancing at his cellphone and observing the scene around him, every bit as nervous and threatened as the raggedy Pakistani, who knows the enemy when he sees him despite the fact that he reassures the American, \\"I am a lover of America.\\"  Changez observes that the American appears to be on a \\"mission\\"; he thus has that driven quality Americans associate with a terrorist.  \\"It takes one to know one,\\" as the saying goes, and so as an American for a short time and a fundamentalist as well, like \\"Notes from Underground,\\" thePakistani persecutor pursues his vengeance from the beginning, knowing which fear buttons to push, which American icons to attack, what body language to use -- all in an attempt to dupe the American, who is as easy to deceive as were the university officials who admitted him to Princeton and the employers of the so-called \\"reluctant\\" fundamentalist, Changze.  Right away the Pakistani notices the breeding, the patrician bearing of the agent/operative, and his bottled up anger is ignited once more.  He refers to the \\"fake\\" masonry and architecture of Princeton University, arguably one of the most beautiful colleges in the world.  He sees in the American a quest for \\"the perfect cup of tea,\\" something familiar to self-indulgent spoiled Americans, not unlike the search for the perfect wine, at once bachanalian and hedonistic. It is the single most officious symptom of American self-indulgence.  At the same time, he concedes that \\"Princeton made everything possible to me,\\" and that means becoming enlightened and thus subsequently becoming a fundamentalist.  Changez became a materialist only to realize that no matter how successful he became, he would never be an American in the most fundamental sense.  He would never be entitled.<br /><br />The author would suggest that he makes it chrystal clear that Changez rejects that sense of privilege granted by the rich and the bullies of global corporations in their name, but I would say what resonates in the book is Changze's jealousy of the American \\"haves.\\"  It is they who enjoy luxury and privilege while the rest of the \\"meritocracy,\\" including him, is excluded from the inner circles of social acceptance.  Changez could never really possess an Erica, not really.  He knew \\"there was something elusive\\" about her from the first, but he is deceived by her neediness and mistaken due to his hubris and the seeming promise of the American Dream. When Changez admits his glee at the destruction of the Twin Towers, the reader realizes it is reminiscent of the scene revealed around the world on CNN, and he isn't surprised.  Predictable and less than informative, the dialogue registers in the reader's mind, because it reminds him of the hatred fomenting in the Mideast; and whatever you want to say about America, most people here are not haters.  \\"Reluctant\\"?  Hmmm....  Changez expresses his satisfaction with the \\"symbolism of it all, the fact that someone had so visibly brought America to her knees.\\"  He comes to this conclusion when he is still in love with an American.  \\"Reluctant\\"?  I think not.<br /><br />The book is didactic, as observed in the previous quote.  Changze further notes, \\"I had always resented the manner which America conducted its affairs in the world; your country's constant interference in the affairs of others was insufferable,  Vietnam, Korea, the straits of Taiwan, etc.\\"  The book is at once a diatribe and a pieced together justification for hatred.  Despite the fact that the woman he loved experienced a recurrence of her depression prompted by the infamous bombing of the Towers, he exults in the vengeance and humiliation symbolized by the attack.  At the same time he deplores the anti-Arab sentiment evident in America.  His own actions of growing a beard and leaving the country are suspect; Erica's parents do not encourage his visits or calls.  He experiences a vague paranoia not unlike the emotion of the American sitting across from him later in Lahore, patiently taking in the man's hate-filled message.  If the work is didactic, it is also simplistic and alas, predictable.<br /><br />However, one can truthfully say that the book is smoothly written, suspenseful in parts and interesting because it is revealing of the fundamentalist mindset and culture as well as what it feels like to experience the privilege of attending Princeton while at the same time enduring the subtle prejudice manifested in the very legacy of the Ivy League and the condescension evident it its entitled majority.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a predictable piece of political rhetoric, but it is smoothly written and interesting throughout. Disturbingly, it does reinforce our worst fears of what we're doing in our occupation of those far reaches of the world.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle, reviewer<br />Colorado,<br />Author: [[ASIN:1440149577 Bread of Shame]]scene revealed around the world on CNN, and he isn't surprised.

0143038419|2.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love chronicles Gilbert's yearlong sabbatical in hopes of healing from her recent divorce, discovering herself, and achieving the balance between pleasure and spirituality. In lieu of her recent messy divorce from her husband, Gilbert begins to look for a meaning beyond her superficial life in her little personal 14-mile wide world, known as Manhattan.  She journeys to three very different countries in the pursuit of three equally different aspects of life: pleasure, spirituality and the balance between the two.  Gilbert's talent as a writer is undeniable.  She has a witty and refreshing writing style that makes Eat, Pray, Love a very entertaining read and what makes her book so entertaining are Gilbert's mini-adventures throughout the book.  However, Gilbert develops story lines leave the reader questioning the authenticity and truth behind her story.<br />In the first stop of her journey, Italy, Gilbert discovers the art of pleasure.  In Rome, she develops a steamy, passionate love affair with gelato and pizza.  She learns the language, meets new friends and immerses herself in the Italian culture.  She embraces the romanticism that makes Italy one of the most unforgettable places on earth, and leaves Italy free of the chains of depression she was bound to in Manhattan.<br />In India, Gilbert studies the art of devotion.  She works with a Guru to guide her spiritual journey.  Gilbert sets out to separate herself from the luxuries and chaos that she has padded her life with and separate herself from materialism in order to reach spiritual understanding.  Gilbert, frustrated with the difficulty of meditation, spends endless hours in her cluttered mind trying to reach the divine state of cognitive peace.  Finally, after weeks of silent meditation, she has a spiritual breakthrough.  Gilbert writes, \\"To know God, you need only to renounce one thing, your division from God\\" (192).  This quote illustrates her realization that in order to beat peace with your spirituality, your must realize that God is not your superior, but a part of your spirit.<br />Gilbert's last stop is in Bali, Indonesia.  In Bali, Gilbert reconnects with an elderly medicine man that teaches her the importance of balance between the art of pleasure, and the art of devotion.  In her quest for this balance, she finds herself living out a spiritual love story of her own.<br />Eat, Pray, Love is a book that could easily be found in the travel or self-help section of a bookstore, however it is considered a spiritual memoir. From the beginning of Gilbert's journey she makes it clear that she is seeking spirituality beyond the Christian belief of one sole and singular God.  Instead, she is looking for a more personal and self-reliant god, one who is within Gilbert and accepts her for who she is.  She is searching for a God who loves and appreciates her positive traits and accepts and embraces her negative flaws, all at once. Gilbert writes that she, \\"always responded with breathless excitement to anyone who has ever said that God does not live in a dogmatic scripture or in a distant throne in the sky,\\" (14).<br />I enjoyed reading about Gilbert's understanding in the Buddhist and Hindu faith, however I felt myself constantly waiting for more insight. While reading Eat, Pray, Love I prayed (no pun intended) that Gilbert would tear down her walls of narcissism and superficiality.  Yet despite her spiritual awakening in India, she never reaches this resolution, this aspect made it difficult for me to like and relate to Gilbert as a person and the heroine of her novel.<br />Gilbert's writing style, riddled with her clever humor and vibrant attention to detail, make for entertaining storylines.  I felt like I was walking the crowded streets of Rome with her or perched seaside in India, deep in meditation. I often found myself laughing out loud at her witty commentary.  Her unique and witty metaphors/similes such as \\"Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it's what you want before you commit,\\" (67) made her book enjoyable.  I found it refreshing that the author of a spiritual memoir could interject borderline cynical and self-deprecating humor without steering too far off the spiritual path.<br />Despite Gilbert's humor and wit, it is Gilbert's lack of authenticity that made me dislike the book.  Every event seems to be prepackaged and wrapped in a bow, leading to a realization and stepping stone for the next event to come.  Everything seems to fall in Gilbert's favor.  As an avid traveler, I have found this to be true: when travelling, not everything, if ANYTHING, goes according to plan. Gilbert writes \\"...to travel is worth any cost or sacrifice,\\" however I did not see any sacrifice in Gilbert's journey in between drinking wine on the sea in Italy and meeting her soul mate.  It was all a little too Hollywood for me, as if Gilbert wrote her memoir with a future screenplay adaptation in mind.<br />A memoir clearly geared for women in their mid 30's to early 40's, at times it felt as though I was reading recycled Sex and the City plots. Gilbert's stories were complete with the same rising action, climax and resolution that is expected in a 30 minute television show.  Trite quotes such as, \\"In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely,\\" (147) made me roll my eyes and made me at how obviously she was preying on middle-aged women on the cusp of a mid-life crisis, looking for a spiritual guru to lean on.<br />For a reader looking for a spiritual memoir, I would not recommend Eat, Pray, Love.  Gilbert's book has an entertaining plot and story, but Gilbert's book as a whole is just that: a story.  Her lack of authenticity and superficiality make this bookjust another New York Times Bestseller, not a staple for bookshelves or a tool for spiritual enlightenment.
B000002GYW|5.0|One of the best albums ever in my opinion.  I love the outlaw theme of the album.  The songs are well crafted with an interesting mix of \\"Wild West\\" country and rock.  This is an album you want to listen to from start to finish...don't jump around. Very fun to listen to.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I thought this was going to be even better than the BBC version (which I love) it was horrible!!!!  I was speechless at the end .. and not in the good way! They left so many parts out and what was most annoying was the literally hated each other and the next minute they were madly in love ( I can only guess due to time constraints?) it was painful to watch. BBC's Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle cannot be topped.
0446567337|1.0|If you like thinly developed characters in a dull, unsurprising story that will put you to sleep, this is the book for you. At least four other authors wrote books with this same title in the past five years. Very contrite.   I am not a NS fan but thought I would give him a shot. Who knows, as the author of about eight books, maybe he learned something at this point. Not a chance. Get this one from the library. Save your money.
0553805460|5.0|First off whoever said that Jordan wrote all the positive reviews makes one think that all the bad reviews may be by the same person also.  Sounds like a personal beef because this book makes one laugh at his insane personality.  This isn't a Wall Street 101 book, it's about the Wolf and why he called himself the wolf.  He's insane and he tells you he is and what he did.  All you people wrote bad reviews need to lighten up and should have read something else.      I'm 100% convinced that all the bad reviews were written by the same person so don't go by the reviews because most of them have the same writting style.    Get the book, funny as hell!

This books just reinforces King is the thriller master.    (on a side note - also showcases the talent screen writers have to be able to to adapt a short story to a film and not copy the book.)    They are not the same story, but have the same premise.      Sit back and enjoy.
B0029LHW68|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars has said in interviews that they wanted this CD to almost be like listening to a movie, I feel that have done that! The music is very much carpe diem, meaning to get up and seize the day. It is so cool to have the fans of 30 Seconds to Mars be apart of the cd and hearing their voices as well. Kings and Queens is not just the only amazing song in the album, Alibi, This is War, Night of the Hunter. It pretty much is all amazing, and Jared's voice is simply flawless. I very much encourage everyone to give this a chance!
0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief was an incredibly fun book! The story is told from the perspective of Percy Jackson, a twelve year old boy who is a notorious troublemaker in school. Percy is convinced trouble finds him, and that most of the incidents that occur are freak accidents in which he has no part. After yet another expulsion, Percy is sent home to his mom and awful step-dad. Once home, a series of events occur that send Percy and his friend Grover on a mad race to reach a place called Half Blood Hill.<br /><br />Percy arrives at a \\"summer camp\\" that is for kids like himself. He is informed that he is in fact a demigod, the child of his human mother and his father, one of the Greek gods. Initially he thinks it's all a joke, but he quickly starts to believe as he gets to know the other campers. While at the camp, they discover his father is Poseidon, the God of the Sea. Poseidon had made a pact with his brothers to sire no more heroes (the children of gods), and Poseidon's acknowledgement of Percy as his son angers the other gods.<br /><br />It comes to light that Zeus's famed lightning bolt has been stolen, and he blames Poseidon and Percy. Percy is given the quest of finding the bolt and returning it to Zeus before total war breaks out across the Earth. Percy, Grover, and their new friend Annabel head off on a cross-country trek to find the bolt. On their journey, they encounter many of the famous monsters of Greek mythology, as well as a few gods who want to slow Percy's progress. The young heroes explore everywhere from Las Vegas to Hades' Underworld on their quest. It's an adventure three thousand years in the making, and the three young heroes are up to the challenge!<br /><br />I've always been a mythology geek, so this book was totally up my alley. I bought it a while back and suddenly word of a movie started circulating. I took a short break from my various review books to get through this one so I could see the movie in theatres (there are just some movies that need to be seen on a giants screen!). It was a quick read, taking only two days to get through, but there was no lack of action! There were tons of sword fights and magical elements to keep the mind occupied!<br /><br />I've encountered a ton of other people who have either read or are reading The Lightning Thief as well. The story is about a twelve year old boy, and I bought it in the children's section, but most of the reader's I've encountered were adults! I met a woman yesterday who said her son had just finished the entire series and I naturally assumed he was young. When she brought him by, he was at least 17!<br /><br />The plot was definitely interesting. I suppose you could think of Percy Jackson as being to the mythological world what Harry Potter is to the wizarding world. I was able to predict some elements, but others caught me off guard. I love a book that can surprise me! The characters were well developed, although some maintained an air of mystery. I'm sure in the later books you learn more about them! I love the twist put on the story of the gods (did you know Olympus is now in the Empire State Building?) and their role in the progress of civilization!<br /><br />The characters in the book are a never-ending plethora of surprises! You meet satyrs and centaurs, naiads and nymphs. If they've been mentioned in mythology, they're in the book! This book will teach you a surprising amount about mythology because it occasionally explains who a character is by summarizing their story from Greek myths. All of the characters are a mix of old and new. Their character stays true to Greek mythology, but they also add some modern elements to make them blend with modern life.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying the remainder of the series! Camp Half Blood would be so much fun! It would be so cool to practice sword fighting and magic! I look forward to finding out the fates of the characters as well as follow their future quests. If you like adventure and mythology, give this book a read!
B000JMKNVK|3.0|I had just read Shutter Island and decided I wanted more of Lehane's masterful suspense writing so I chose to order this book. It starts off with lots of action, some mystery, and it really gets the reader involved in the characters early on. However somewhere around the middle of the story the action got a little too complex. Many characters are introduced and it cause some distraction from what is happening in the story. I think if this was a SHORTER story that got more to the point it would have been more enjoyable. I appreciate the idea of leading the reader in different directions, but I found myself disinterested at some points. If you are a Lehane fan and enjoy his quick wit writing, then this is a good book, but I don't think it's his best. Shutter Island is hard to top.

Big yahoo is finally get to see Summer Glau do her best performance, she takes on the Reavers single handed and the bar fight with Summer also known as character River Tam  is way beyond the wall  nice to see Simon and Kaylee finally come together This is for the person who does not fit in the box or follow the main stream.. welcome to Serenity

I wasn't sure that a whole book could be written about a checklist but he did it and it was interesting.  I have a whole new appreciation for construction, aviation and how the lessons learned can be applied to any important efforts in our life.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avator is a story that takes place in the future where humans realize one of the surrounding planets has an important mineral they require. The obstacle however is that these minerals are located under the land where the Navi's live, who are the native aliens inhabiting this planet. In order for the humans to be able to achieve their mission, they create a biological body called the Avatar, to be mentally linked with a human soldier controlling it remotely, and send it to the Navi's in order to learn about them and eventually help defeat them. Jake Sully takes this mission and becomes the Avatar, only for him to live with the Navi's and see the situation differently from their side.    Amazing movie and story! The political meanings behind it is so powerful. Lots of humans are willing to destroy the lives and well beings of others in order to make some economic gains, just the way the humans were willing to wipe out those Navi's in exchange for the minerals they were looking for.     I've seen this movie on 3rd and the experience was great. A friend of mine informed me however that in order to enjoy the 3rd experience, you gotta watch it in I-Max cenima.

B00275EGWY|1.0|This movie does not deserve to be the best movie of 2009. It does not even deserve to be among the nominated. If you enjoy seeing people disarm bombs, then that is the movie for you. The only tension in the movie is to see if and when the bombs will go off while being disarmed. Nothing else happens in the movie. There is no story line whatsoever. Watching this movie is like watching the grass grow.
B002E2M5IC|1.0|I kept hearing about this movie being one of the best of 2009 so I decided to watch it. The very first scene of the movie had me thinking I was in for something really good. But the best and only good part of the movie was those first 10 minutes. What I sat through after that was a whole lot of nothing. The only reason I was able to finish watching it was in the hopes that at least SOMETHING interesting was going to come up. Don't be tricked into buying this by the 5 star reviews, if you absolutely have to find out for yourself what this hype is about then netflix it. The most common argument to bash people who didn't like this movie seems to be \\"oh not enough explosions for you?\\" but really I like all kinds of movies slow paced or high action, but this is just not a good movie in my eyes.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|With all of the vampire craze going on lately, it's refreshing to go back and watch this to see where a lot of the 'lore' came from (not this movie, per se, but from Bram Stoker's story).  A huge change I noticed right away was the sound quality: whenever this movie gets played on tv or payper view, or whatever, the sound is okay, but lacking.  This is something that one would not notice had you never seen this movie on DVD.  Not sure if the producers/mixers went back and 'remastered' the sound, but everything about the sound is better!  All the little nuances and subtleties that I never heard before are there!  The picture quality is good--this movie was made almost 20 yrs ago, so don't expect picture quality like Lord of The Rings.  If you even remotely like this movie, get this edition--well worth it!
B0030ZOYJ0|1.0|This is nothing more than a repackaging of Evangelion: 1.01 made to look like the next in the series. While this version is special edition of 1.01 and has features that 1.01 didn't. Every part of the dressing of this version is meant to imply that it is the next chapter.          If special editions are your thing, then this is a good series to collect special editions of. They did a great job of remaking Evangelion, but that fact can be enjoyed by watching Evangelion 1.01 if you already have that version.     This is just a warning because the dressing on this set is very deceptive.

B000JMKNV0|5.0|I saw the reviews for the movie, and I never like to see a movie like that without reading the book first because I am deaf. Usually the movies don't do justice to the book, though I think this one will. But this was a great book. The writing was taut. No unnecessary writing by the author here. I hate it when authors keep winding the story on and on, adding things that don't need to be added. Lehane writes the bare minimum. That doesn't mean he can't give good descriptions, he does give very good characterization and colorization of the story, he just doesn't waste words, which I like in my authors. It's been a while since I've had a fiction writer whose work I've enjoyed this much. I'm not that crazy about the 'f' word used that much, but given the genre and the military/cop background, it's understandable.<br /><br />Not going to talk about the plotline at all because don't want to spoil any of it for other readers except to say, it really does not take you in any direction you are expecting...
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This movie was excellent. Michael Moore is great as usual. There were many things that happened in our country in the past few years that were totally glossed over or outright ignored by our \\"great\\" media, who whould rather spend hours on the likes of \\"Balloon Boy\\". Thank goodness Michael Moore is able to let us know what we may have missed or not cared about as much as we should have at the time. Highly recommended.

0307271862|1.0|Although I'm always will to suspend disbelief for a good mystery, the plot of the The Man from Beijing was so nonsensical I found suspension impossible. The main character goes blundering around for no real reason other than to further the plot. She stumbles over coincidence after coincidence while waxing nostaligc about wanting to join the Red Guard in the 60's.<br /><br />The reason for the book's horrific murders is weak at best. And the information about China is not always correct. The Chinese were not melting forks in backyard smelters during the Great Leap Forward. They don't use forks.
B002E2M5IC|5.0|I watched it the first time and was completely engrossed but slightly confused.      I watched it a second time solely to enjoy the visual delights of the movie: the interiors, the clothing, the houses and cars, the way the film often looks like a Kodachrome slide.  There's a dream sequence where Larry drives his brother Arthur to the Canadian border that I must have watched 1/2 dozen times, marveling at the colors, the control of light, the ominous music, the movement of the camera, the brilliant composition of shots.  It's the Coens and Roger Deakins at their best.    The third viewing was to try to sort through the things that had been banging around in my head.  Like \\"No Country For Old Men\\", the Coens structure the movie so that every viewer will take something different from it.    Many seem to hate the ending.  I'm in the opposite camp: it was perfection.    I plan to see this year's Best Picture \\"The Hurt Locker\\", but I'll be surprised if it hold a candle to the work of genius that is \\"A Serious Man\\".
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is such a great movie - one of those rare occasions where I love the movie more than the book.  The movie fleshs out some parts the are skimmed over in the book, such as the Lightning Pirates.  That is one of my favorite parts in the movie.  It's a movie that I can watch again and again and not grow tired of it.  Highly recommend this one!
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|First of,I must say Plastic beach is a amazing album. After a long time,Gorillaz finally released this album.   their single \\"STYLO\\" i feel in love with this song. The video rocks as well. The album has different flavor to it,which i absolutely love.   However,this album carries elements of the earlier ones. Wish there were more songs. Nothing more to say, Get the album!   Favorite songs  Stylo  White Flag (different n totally unique.)   On Melancholy Hill ( feel good vibe)   Rhinestone Eye
B00003CXB4|5.0|Like most kids, I grew up watching Disney movies. Then, as I got older, I grew out of some of them. But for some reason, I never grew out of The Lion King. It was-- and remains still-- not only my favorite Disney movie, but my favorite movie PERIOD. I could never watch it too many times! (In fact, I've watched it so many times, I have the entire movie completely memorized! How's that for obsession?) ;) Whether it's the fun, upbeat music that draws me in or the relatable and funny characters or the powerful message of finding yourself despite tragedy, The Lion King is a must-see for anyone. The amazing African music performed by Lebo M and his South African choir (see [[ASIN:B000001M2E Rhythm Of The Pride Lands: Music Inspired By Disney's The Lion King]]) provides the perfect mood setting for the movie. The only thing that's possibly better than watching the movie is seeing the Broadway musical (see [[ASIN:B000001M1B The Lion King (1997 Original Broadway Cast)]]) performed live. If there's one movie you need to see before you die, it's The Lion King, hands down, no doubt about it.
0679409866|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering.

B002KAJ0AO|3.0|I have loved the Backstreet Boys since my first introduction to their music (about 11 years ago).  I've been a loving and devoted fan ever since.  I consider their previous album, [[ASIN:B000VUFJ3C Unbreakable]], to be the pinnacle of BSB's musical talent.  So, naturally, when I heard a new album was coming out, I was very excited.  However, I have to admit that I was sorely disappointed by This is Us...because it's not BSB at all.  The reason I loved BSB was for their easy-to-listen-to music and uplifting messages.  This album is full of harsh, techno beats and some strange/mixed messages (for example, the song PDA).  I feel like this album is BSB's way of trying to \\"fit in\\" with the shifts in society.  But that defeats the whole purpose of what BSB is all about.  I loved their music for its unique style and overall \\"feel-good\\" nature.  I hate saying it, but it must be said-- this is the first BSB album with songs on it that I don't like.  All I can say is, if they come out with another album, I'm definitely going to \\"try before I buy.\\"
B002U0KHMY|4.0|I don't think I've ever quite heard of a show quite like \\"White Collar,\\" a clever new mystery show in which the FBI decides to employ a brilliant criminal to help them bust other \\"white collar\\" criminals. While it has an intriguing new twist on the odd-couple cop show, it also has brilliantly witty writing, a murky conspiracy within the FBI, and some excellent actors with plenty of chemistry -- and it promises to get even better.<br /><br />While searching for a thief known as the Dutchman, FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) hears that gentleman thief/conman/counterfeiter Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer)-- who he put in prison -- has escaped, only to allow himself to be recaptured.  Caffrey is desperate to find his girlfriend Kate, and so he makes Burke an offer: free him from prison, and he'll help him catch the Dutchman.<br /><br />Though he's dubious about Neal, Peter reluctantly agrees. After only a few hours out, Neal has a new wardrobe, a luxurious apartment and a wealthy landlady who doesn't care that he's a former thief. And he's working for the FBI.<br /><br />Together, the odd partners tackle a bunch of tricky white-collar cases: data hidden in a designer dress, a priceless Bible stolen from a mobster, a painting with a dodgy trail, smuggled Iraqi artifacts, clashes with Interpol in Chinatown, a jewel robbery, infiltrating Wall Street, real estate fraud, an illegal organ-trafficking ring, priceless wine bottles, and a kidnapper who is gunning for Neal. And as Neal tries to unravel the clues that Kate has left him, he and Peter become entangled in a shadowy conspiracy within the FBI...<br /><br />The first season of \\"White Collar\\" is a lot like Neal Caffrey -- elegant, smart and charming, to the point where you don't really care that it has some painfully unrealistic moments  (trotting their only witness onto a rooftop party with the KILLER nearby?), and a few slow spots. Fortunately, the writers seem to be smoothing the lumps out.<br /><br />And the writers have a knack for winding together the one-off cases with an overarcing plot about a corrupt FBI agent who is conspiring against Neal and Peter. There's plenty of hilarious dialogue (\\"It's a loft, seized in a DEA bust -- fifteen hundred square feet, service elevator. It's perfect!\\" \\"Is that a chalk outline?\\" \\"I'm sure they've cleaned that up by now\\") and suspenseful little scenes where Neal and/or Mozzie disguise themselves to infiltrate secure places where the FBI can't go without a warrant.<br /><br />But the show's heart is DeKay and Bomer. DeKay is a snappy, sharp-edged FBI agent who is willing to bend the rules to get the job done, and respects Neal more than he'll admit. And Bomer is a sort of 21st-century Remington Steele: boyishly handsome, clever, charming, refined, and a little bit rakish. At the same time, you really feel sorry for him because of the loss of Kate, and the hints that she may be in on the plot against him.<br /><br />There's also a solid supporting cast -- Tiffani Thiessen as Peter's loving, long-suffering wife, and Willie Garson as the hilarious Mozzie (\\"I just said that to a guy who enjoys killing people with his bare hands!\\"). Also good performances by Diahann Carroll and Noah Emmerich.<br /><br />It sounds like just another odd-couple cop show, but \\"White Collar Season 1\\" has the benefit of excellent writing, acting and some grippingly suspenseful plots.

B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I have been an avid Backstreet Boys fan for about 11 years now, and I have always loved their music.  I have to say, though, that Unbreakable is-- in my mind-- their best album.  I write this after [[ASIN:B002KAJ0AO This Is Us]] has been released, and I still think that Unbreakable surpasses its newer counterpart.  Whether I feel like listening to something to lift my spirits or just want some background noise while I'm working on something else, I put in this album.  The music is calming, though some of the songs are almost a mix of near-techno with a definite pop underbeat.  There have been times when I've just stuck Unbreakable in the CD player and put it on repeat, and before I know it, the whole day has gone by.  It's so easy to listen to; my parents, who are typically very picky about music, say that they even enjoy it.  No matter if you've been a BSB fan for years or have never heard their music before, this is an album I highly recommend.  It's a great example of the musical genuis that is the Backstreet Boys.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|This is a review of the Kindle Version.    Dune is arguably the best science fiction series of all time.  I won't go into a more detailed review because there are over 1000 on Amazon and I can add little to the discussion.    What I will review is the Kindle Version of this book.  It is flawless, an exact clean copy.  (I have the original Dune in paperback, and have read it several times).  This Kindle version is perfect, down to the same misspellings in the original paper book.  The fonts are even similar, including the slightly different font in the preludes to each chapter. This may seem trivial, but it the number of errors in Kindle versions of books like this is astounding.    Some might quibble over the pricing, because if you really wanted to, you could get a paperback version cheaper than the Kindle version.  However, to me, the value of having all of the Dune books in a nice thin package of the Kindle more than makes it worth the extra buck.    There is a interesting point in the book in which Paul Atriedes gets a tiny little scroll-like reader of the O.C. Bible as a gift.  He had to use some type of magnifying device to read it.  This was, ironically, one of the only future technology concepts that Frank Herbert \\"guessed wrong\\" about.  Funny - even the most forward-looking science fiction writers could not foresee the magic of the Kindle!

B00328G4V6|3.0|This is mostly a demo.  This collection is definitely for fans only. As Rolling Stone pointed out,: \\"probably not\\" in response to whether this stuff represents Jimi's final vision.  I mean, let's face it. Jim's magic was as much due to his creativity in the studio at the mixing board as it was due to his playing. I'm not saying these tracks are bad. I'm just saying they are \\"unfinished.\\" It doesn't make Jimi any less (or more) a genius . I'm just saying it's unfinished, period.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I open this review with a very strong piece of advice: please listen to this album in its entirety.  Then come back to it within a day or two (or sooner, if you are so inclined) and give it a second listen from beginning to end.  If you do that, unless you really dislike \\"this kind of music\\", I'm relatively certain you will be enchanted with the album permanently.  Plastic Beach is truly an amazing work.    Keep the following thoughts in mind as you navigate through other reviews of Plastic Beach.  First, immediately discount any that express disillusion that this album is not the sequel to its stellar predecessor, Demon Days (2005).  Comparisons to Demon Days (and, by extension, the 2001 self-titled debut album) are useful to the extent they allow you to see how the Gorillaz sound has evolved over the course of a decade.  To truly appreciate this work fairly, however, you should judge it on the strength of its own merits.  Moreover, this review is being written the day of its United States release, and there are currently a handful of reviews that rate the album poorly.  These reviews seem to have a few things in common: they show very little regard to not only the craftsmanship and genius behind this work, but seem to be written from a jaded aspect that belies someone writing against a deadline and only taking time to listen to the album once (if they even listened that much).    That said, while this album isn't perfection personified, it really is quite good, easily earning a 9 out of 10 rating.  Below I will grade each track individually, but first I want to address the album as a whole.  Clocking in at just under an hour, this album is a cohesive whole that takes you on a sonic journey full of unlikely sights and stops along the way (often even within the individual songs themselves).  It's not surprising that this album in its formative stages was originally named \\"Carousel\\" by its loving architect, musical wizard Damon Albarn.  The album is a special kind ofride.  At times the album makes you think, but not too hard, because it doesn't purport to take a stand on any of the issues it brings to the surface.  Other times the album makes you want to sing along, but not too loudly, because you want to be able to appreciate the artistry at work in each song.  Most importantly, the album makes you feel emotion.  Whether it be exhilaration, abandon, wonderment, or disquiet, you feel it with force.      On to the snapshots of each song in the US track-list.    1) Orchestral Intro -- 4/5        This track lets you know you are headed somewhere important and maybe just a little bit different.  If you listen closely, the fade-out carries a hint of distortion, which I take as an indication that the nature you are about to experience is quite unnatural.    2) Welcome to The World of The Plastic Beach -- 3/5        There's probably no truer living representation of hip-hop than Snoop Dogg, and he serves as an apropos master of ceremonies welcoming you to your destination.  Snoop has always had a unique five-star flow, and it's on full display on this track.  Ever since his debut album Doggystyle (1993), however, he has an uneven track-record of bringing the heat to whatever song he's spitting rhymes on.  The frustrating thing about Snoop is that both the listener and he are in on the fact that many times he is as lazy a lyricist as the flow of his trademark delivery, and that is indeed the case in this song, using trite expressions like \\"Boss Dogg\\" (not once, but twice), \\"mirror, mirror on the wall\\" and \\"crack-a-lackin\\".  For the record, my wife thinks that Snoop did exactly what he was supposed to do on this track: introduce, not steal the stage.  Regardless, aided by the sick horns of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, this song helps get you in the mood to groove.    3) White Flag -- 3/5        A light, flighty orchestral piece by the Lebanese National Orchestra For Oriental and Arabic Music (I think I got that right...) takes you to Bollywood and some other exotic places you've probably never been to as you skip across the sand of Plastic Beach for the first time.  You are suddenly greeted by a hot potato back-and-forth rap between British grime rap stars Kano and Bashy set to a dub beat.  Their wordplay forms the musical meat sandwiched between the previously mentioned beginning of the track and its conclusion, which is a synthesis of the orchestral part and the dub beat.  The final outcome is both an unlikely treat and treatise from your locale.    4) Rhinestone Eyes -- 5/5        This song has video single written all over it.  2D's vocals take center stage for the first time.  It's a heavily synthesized pop tune complete with catchy not-quite-a-chorus repeats of the phrase \\"Love Electric-tric-tric-tric-tric\\" that you can only imagine yourself chanting alongside Noodle.  This song also carries that signature \\"Gorillaz sound\\" of keyboards and drumbeats that can be traced back to their debut album.  This song is definitely one of the reasons I regard the album so highly.    5) Stylo -- 5/5        The lead single and video from the album.  \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" it is not, but this fact only adds to \\"Stylo\\"'s charm.  An unyielding beat accentuated by an insidious, haunting repetition of the phrase \\"Overload\\", a slick verse from Mos Def, and the undeniable raw power of Bobby Womack make this song an instant classic.  You don't get \\"Stylo\\" at first, you just know it has a catchy beat.  After multiple listens, though, you realize the song is consummate.  It is worth mentioning that essential to the whole Gorillaz concept is the fact that their music is both an audio and visual experience.  Taken in that light, the promotional video shot for this track by co-creator Jaime Hewlett does an excellent job of immediately engaging the audience and drawing them into Plastic Beach.     6) Superfast Jellyfish -- 4/5        Rumored to be the second video and single from the album, this song is dripping with sinister irony.  De La Soul become the first rap artists to score a follow-up opportunity with the Gorillaz, and they do not disappoint in this twisted indictment of consumerism, cloaked in a breakfast meal jingle.  Though not as in-your-face and extreme as, say, Johnathan Swift's 1729 pamphlet \\"A Modest Proposal\\" the implications of this song are meant to be frightening.  Gruff Rhys also lends his vocals to the track that is both scary and scary good.      7) Empire Ants -- 5/5        The beautiful, peaceful beginning of this song shows Plastic Beach at its most serene.  The guitar makes a rare appearance, and it strums blissfully along in concert with 2D's singing and piano accompaniment.  Then, halfway through, the song it improbably explodes into a shimmering disco-pop tune completed by the vocals of Yukumi Nagano from the Swedish group, Little Dragon.  This may very well be the album's best song, though \\"Broken\\" gives it a serious run for its money a few songs later.    8) Glitter Freeze -- 2/5        Personal preference here, but this is my least favorite song of the lot.  Mostly instrumental with a few sparse words from curmudgeon Mark E Smith, this song is an aural assault on your eardrums and mind.  Often, after this song ends, I'm relieved, because it feels like I've just been willingly violated, which might just be a microcosm for one of the tenets of the album, namely the willful violation of our own home planet.  But just as soon as you begin to contemplate that we are off to our next song.    9) Some Kind of Nature -- 3/5        Many are split on this Lou Reed guest effort, where his sing-song voice takes Albarn's piano-based beatnik ditty for a quick spin.  Some hail it as the watermark of Plastic Beach, while others decry it as its nadir.  The song comes pre-loaded with a fully realized chorus and simulated clapping that beckons singing along.  I'm still not sure what to make of it all, I find myself in neither of the previously mentioned camps of supporters or naysayers, but I believe it is a solid addition to the album regardless.    10) On Melancholy Hill -- 5/5        An endearing track.  Listen closely and you'll hear a rhythm that lies beneath Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida\\" and the song it borrowed heavily from \\"Foreigner Suite\\" by Cat Stevens.  I doubt it is intentional, and it is otherwise completely overshadowed by what is quite an uncharacteristically upbeat, almost saccharine ode from Albarn.  While this song is technically 2D from Gorillaz, it is also every bit just Damon being himself.    11) Broken -- 5/5        My favorite of the album.  The song evokes Clint Eastwood with its pseudo-riff on \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\" theme by Hugo Montenegro.  The song is beyond phenomenal, and I think this is no coincidence, another 2D solo joint that can just as easily be seen as Damon Albarn as himself.  The beat is seriously sick and haunting at the same time.  The production sounds as if lifted off a top-flight hip-hop producer's private instrumental songbook, but it is so much more due to Damon's vocals dominating the song.  I don't care what he is singing about in this song, I just want to listen and feel his lament.  It's why this album, and its creator, are one-of-a-kind.    12) Sweepstakes -- 4/5        Hated this song at first, due to the repetition of the beat and the rhyme.  However, keep listening: the lyrics actually change, not in their content, but in their delivery, just as the song itself transforms into something greater than the sum of its parts.  Several minutes of repetition in, you are greeted again by the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble amplified this time with a percussion section that evokes an American college football halftime band performance.  Mos Def is most definitely a winner on this track.  Hip-hop heads will prefer this track to the rest of the album's offerings, which speaks to the fact that there is almost something for everyone here.    13) Plastic Beach -- 3/5        I can't hear MickJones' contribution to this song, but ex-Clash band-mate (and frequent Albarn-collaborator) Paul Simonon's strings sound pretty good on the title track.  The track is funky, a little bit eerie, and definitely keeps the mood of the album and its maybe-fictional-maybe-real setting at the center of your mind as your trek through Plastic Beach nears its end.    14) To Binge -- 5/5        For those not expecting Blur to ever make a guest appearance on this album -- well, don't worry, they didn't.  But this is as close as you'll ever get, since even the most casual Gorillaz fan will notice that 2D doesn't sound anything like himself on this record.  In fact, he sounds just like Albarn from Blur during the height of the 90s Britpop era.  This time, however, he is trading verses with guest singer Yukumi Nagano who appears in her second contribution to the album.  The song is like a fading sunset, with clouds developing as the song itself fades out.  If this is the final album from the Gorillaz, I think this song serves as its official good-bye.  And even though two more tracks come after this one, they feel more like encores than anything.    15) On The Cloud of Unknowing -- 4/5        But what encores they are!  Powerful, powerful stuff from Bobby Womack here, coupled with chilling and atmospheric instrumentation from Sinfonia ViVA, make this a contemplative song, even if the first few listens give little clue as to what you and singer are contemplating.  It can be simply described as a pretty song.    16) Pirate Jet -- 4/5        I have an image of an animated pogo-stick or slinky, or something bouncy like that just hopping all over this song like a little kid.  \\"It's all good news now, because we left the taps running for a hundred years.\\"  Call it tongue-wagging sarcastic optimism at the prospect that even as foolish and wasteful we humans are, Nature will adapt to whatever is thrown at it, and persevere.  That's my take, at least.  And with that, the final opus in theGorillaz trilogy (this is widely rumored to be the final album for the group) comes to a close.    If you have made it to the end of this review, thank you.  I had fun sharing my rambling thoughts on what I feel is a great album.  If you have not already purchased this album, give it a try, you will be happy you did.

1401323820|3.0|The story was very good.  It was like watching the show on TV.  However, the book is much shorter than one is led to believe.  I guess it would have helped if I had read the page numbers.  If you love the show, which I do, you will enjoy the book.  Keeps you guessing until the end.
0316017922|4.0|I'm still not completely sold on Gladwell's shtick, but I do love his anecdotes. In this book he attempts to trace success to environmental and cultural factors, and does quite a good job. Gladwell looks at oddities such as professional Canadian hockey players and their overwhelming tendency to be born in the first three months of the year. Why? Because at a very young age January 1st is the cutoff date and at that age the older kids have a significant size advantage. Since these bigger kids are selected for the better teams they go on to get better and more training as they progress through adolescence. Essentially, Canada is leaving out a large number of potential pro hockey players due to this early selection process.    One of the more fascinating chapters in the book addresses why Asians are better at math than everyone else. Gladwell asserts that the reasoning for this is cultural and linguistically-based, I will just give a summary of the linguistic side. In Cantonese, for example, numbers take only 1/4 of a second to pronounce, but in English most numbers take 1/3 of a second to pronounce. Thus the average Cantonese speaker can handily remember ten numbers while the English speaker cannot. (we usually can absorb six or seven, hence telephone numbers). In English, our number system is not intuitive and does not make a whole lot of logical sense. We use a suffix on the numbers 13-19, and then when we get to twenty we use a prefix. In Cantonese, twenty-five would be something like \\"two ten five,\\" which is much more systematic than logical than \\"twenty-five.\\" Because of these differences young children in Asian-speaking countries can often count up to 40, whereas their American counterparts can only reach 15. Essentially we're a full year behind and in a critical development period. Gladwell also goes on to trace math skills back to Eastern versus Western farming techniques, but I won't spoil that for you.    One criticism of this book I've heard is that Gladwell places too much emphasis for success on environmental factors. He does talk heavily about environmental factors, but he also never fails to state that hard work and determination by the individual is key to success.    Recommendation: While Outliers isn't going to win you success, it's certainly an interesting look at the causes and factors that lead to success in our world.
0385335997|4.0|In Voyager Gabaldon continues the Outlander saga of 20th-century physician Claire Randall and 18th-century rebel Jamie Fraser. The book begins 20 years after the last book left off. Jamie is imprisoned, and once he's pardoned he buys a printing business. Believing that Jamie died at Culloden, Claire returns to her own century. She is reunited with her first husband and gives birth to a daughter, Brianna. When Claire's first husband's dies she takes Brianna to Scotland to introduce her to her true heritage. After some research they discover that Jamie survived the battle at Culloden. Claire decides she must find Jamie and once again steps through the stones on Craigh na Dun to find Jamie in Edinburgh in 1766. Once reunited Jamie and Claire want to lead a quiet life, but the kidnapping of Jamie's nephew throws the couple into a new pursuit.<br /><br />I enjoyed Voyager as much as I enjoyed the other books in the Outlander Series. I've already started the Drums of Autumn the 4th book in the series.
1439163855|2.0|I rented this book on CD from my local library so I could listen to it in the car.  BIG mistake.  It's really hard to see where you're going when you're sobbing.  I can't tell you how many times I gasped at the twists and turns.  Overall, it was a good book, but the ending was horrible.  I'm more of the happy ending type of gal.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie is a true joy to view. Something for all ages. A must for the DVD library.
B002S0OBN2|2.0|The casting was excellent. Ramin Karimloo plays an powerful Phantom, and he has a fantastic voice. He projects well, captures the emotion, and looks gorgeous. Although that's not necessarily a good thing - Karimloo is 31 years old, looks wonderful in a suit, and he looks way too young for this role. But that's not such a big deal - cast for voice, not age. Sierra Boggess is a lovely Christine, although the way the role is written it doesn't give her much room to flex her acting muscles. She has a great voice, though. Both of those actors really save the show from complete failure. Joseph Millson is good as Raoul, but he doesn't have much of a part either so you can't really get an accurate read on his skills.    One major problem with this show is the recycling of melodies. I'm not against that practice for the most part - it can really add continuity and draw parallels that enhance the plot. But it was a bit excessive in this show. You had melodies being used from other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber, including \\"The Woman in White\\" and \\"The Beautiful Game,\\" as well as melodies from \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" showing up several times (Little Lotte, Notes, Prima Donna, Don Juan Triumphant & Twisted Every Way were all in there). Then there was the fact that melodies from this show got used over and over again to the point of ridiculousness. I wanted to scream every time I heard \\"Beautiful,\\" the song that Gustave plays for the Phantom.    Another complaint - the lyrics are absolutely abysmal. Glenn Slater wrote them, and they are definitely not even close to the quality of the lyrics Charles Hart wrote for \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" We have lines like \\"He knows you're made of finer stuff\\" (Seriously? The Phantom says \\"stuff?\\") and \\"does it fill your every sense? Is it terribly intense?\\" that just take away from the admittedly beautiful music. Several of the songs aren't half-bad on their own (\\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\", \\"Beauty Underneath\\", \\"Till I Hear You Sing\\" and \\"Love Never Dies\\" are good and definitely ear-worm material), but once you actually start listening to the lyrics and realize what they mean in terms of plot the effect is totally ruined.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|Even with all the less than stellar reviews I went ahead and purchased this set (since my ex got custody of the nice, sturdy, silver-boxed sets!) thinking I'd save some bucks. The packaging is incredibly bad. Many of the fragile plastic cases were already cracked. No listing of episodes except on each disc in a font size no bigger than a gnat's whisker. As for the quality of the discs, several of them tend to just stop playing for several seconds and then start again. What's with that? Doesn't happen often enough to REALLY annoy me. Anyway, back to the packaging. Here's my advice. When you order this, also order the Bellagio-Italia CD/DVD Storage Binder which has room for 48 DVD's. It's about 20 bucks. It comes in three colors. I chose the burgundy and I swear its the exact color of the Command uniforms from the series. It is a beautiful binder and will protect the discs a lot better than that cheap green plastic stuff. Oh yeah...there are 49 discs in the this set but room in the binder for only 48. You could buy more insert sleeves but here's a much cheaper option. Get into your software stash and find one of those little paper sleeves that so many CD's come in. Adhere some double sided tape to the back of the sleeve and stick that puppy on the inside of the back cover. Or the inside front cover. Voila! Storage for disc number 49. I just got the Deep Space Nine series and that packaging is on the questionable side as well so I'll probably order another Storage Binder. Sure wish they made 'em in Engineer Gold and Medical Blue to go along with the the Command burgundy!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|When I began reading Twilight I started with the first book and read them all straight through. And, in my opinion, they were written beautifully. Breaking Dawn was no exception. I, too, was surprised by all the bad reviews. I took a moment to read some of them and found that, in my opinion, some of the situations in Breaking Dawn were taken in the wrong context. Too literally almost. First of all, it's a fantasy book about Vampires and Shape Shifters. While Stephanie Meyer makes it incredibly easy for society to wrap their heads around Bella's situation, I don't think it's fair to say the book is morally wrong. For example, Jacob does not fall in love with an infant. He sees Renesmee as his responsibility to protect and nurture until she decides he is her one and only. The only difference is that he already knows the outcome. It's not like Jacob is thinking about Renesmee in a phyisical way. And Meyer makes that very clear. In our society that part of Jacob's CULTURE would be deemed as perverted, but I think we can all agree that Bella is no longer living in a society like ours. Things just operate differently. There are other situations like that in Breaking Dawn that were misconstrued by some. Perhaps if the book was reread with more of an open mind it would make more sense and be a better experiance. I think the book was amazing, and that it was all perfectly tied together. With a happy ending as the icing on the cake.
B000VBJEFK|4.0|Another great movie from pixar. It is great animation no matter you love food or not.
B002VECM4A|4.0|Clarece \\"Precious\\" Jones is an overweight black girl , pregnant with her second child, living with her abusive mother in 1980's Harlem. This is the simple story of how she gets the strength to go outside herself to try and make a better life for herself. The film succeeds because of how well it neutralizes its schmaltzy premise. Precious is a victim of unconscionable abuse, which we see but only in enough detail to form a bond with her and care about her welfare- explicit this film is not. What it is instead is an honest depiction of a life that is lived by many in the real world, but without the outlet or the compassion to help them rise out of it. Its characters are real people, some serious, some funny, but all with a familiarity to them that you get attached to. Everyone, that is, except for Precious' mother, played with incredible rage by Oscar-winner Mo'Nique. Her Lennox Ave. apartment is the eighth circle of hell, a compact box of rage, regret, anger and toxicity. Precious' journey out of there and into a life without pain or misery is inspiring both for its honesty as well as its lack of manipulation for the viewer. Well-made and very well-acted, this is rare, magic stuff.
0802130208|2.0|It engages that literary proclivity of really long novels without much of a working plot. This makes for a book of collected series of related scenes that are often insightful and funny independent of the whole, but also don't really serve the whole, at least not toward some end. It's a little like a Monty Python movie. You watch it, waiting for something to happen, and when nothing does - again, nothing happens toward some greater arc of storytelling - it seems like a bad movie. But then we remember specific scenes, and maybe watch the movie again, this time not worrying about the plot, resulting in heightened esteem. So goes my thesis about why people like Monty Python.    Funny as Dunces often proves to be, it is a joyless book. Riley is a narcissist bordering on sociopathic, and to endure that, without the pull or guiding light of a plot, will make this an unfun book for most readers. The dialogue has a great ring, but the characters are a pinch to mean, or pathetic, or stupid to be real. It also, rather ironically considering the linguistic verisimilitude, makes New Orleans feel like a fictitious place.    And so Confederacy of Dunces isn't so much a story as a presentation of Ignatius Riley. It is often hilariously sardonic and clever, but seems to be answering unasked questions about the race of Jabba the Hutt. This book is the quotidian dealings of an average \\"Hutt.\\" If Jabba hadn't gone into loan-sharking, this is what his life might have been.

0385333846|5.0|Simply put one of the most important books by one of the Centuries greatest authors. If you want a chance at understanding Vonnegut you must study this work. Yeah, you hear it over and over but in this case it is true. Read it and make your own conclusion, which is one of the wonders of this masterpiece.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Me being an antagonist lover, I loved this movie. First we see Snape clarifying his loyalty to the dark lord VOLDEMORT (That's right I said it, heheh) Then we see the weasley's house get destroyed, which I thought was a brutal middle finger to the protagonists, heheheheh. I loved this movie because it was darker and more sinister than the other Harry Potter films. Also I don't read the books, so maybe that's why I don't see any flaws in this film.    GO LORD VOLDEMORT (HA, I said his name again)
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Excellent transfer for a movie this age!  Sound is above average (especially the Bowie numbers) and the movie is fun to watch for both children and adults.  Heartily recommended.

0394721780|5.0|I paid for volume one, but got both volumes for 20ish bucks.  It was an amazing deal.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Five discs, with five episodes and seven HOURS of special features, which is a great deal no matter how you add it up.  The stories are great, powerful, emotional, with such stars as Lindsay Duncan, David Morrissey, and Timothy Dalton.  Big stars for big stories!  Cybermen, the Master, and, yes, one scene with a Dalek.  A flashback, but still, it counts, it counts!  It is a lovely, painful, but brilliant last send off for the Tenth Doctor, the amazing David Tennant.<br />I'll miss him - he has become THE Doctor out of all the wonderful actors who have played the Doctor.
B000002MP2|5.0|I saw the video for \\"Basket Case\\" on MTV in 1994, when I was 17, and I was instantly hooked.  I went out and bought the CD and ended up loving every song on the CD.  This is one of the very few albums I have listened to(and I have listened to a lot) where every song is good or great.  Many other albums have one to a few good songs.  This album you can play straight through and love it all.  I listened to the CD several times, everyday, for at least a year.  My favorite songs are \\"Sassafras Roots\\", \\"Longview\\", \\"Basket Case\\", \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", and \\"When I Come Around\\".  I probably purchased at least 5 copies, since I scratched the hell out of them, playing them so much.<br /><br />The songs all have kind of the same sound, with the same few chords played over and over, in different patterns.  Fast and furious drum beats accompany the simple, yet addictive, guitar riffs.  A lot of Green Day haters criticized this chaotic \\"noise\\", but that's punk for you. There's something about the sound that is addictive, like a drug.  Most of it is upbeat and energetic, while still appealing to rebellious teenagers with the lyrics.  It makes you feel somewhat \\"euphoric\\", at least it made me feel that way, back in the day and still does.  The effect is similar to listen to early, upbeat Beatles' songs.<br /><br />I was disappointed with Green Day's albums after \\"Dookie\\", until \\"[[ASIN:B0002OERI0 American Idiot]]\\" was released, approximately a decade later.  I had not listened to Green Day in years, but loved the new, different, sound of Green Day.  It started a Green Day renaissance and I had to listen to \\"Dookie\\" again and I re-discovered how great the album is.  I don't like it as much as when I was a teenager, but it passes the test of time and I still enjoy listening to it.<br /><br />Any teenager out there should check out this album.  Many adults may enjoy it too.  I miss the days when I blasted this album through my car's speakers, repeatedly.  Check out these other Green Day Albums: Kerplunk, American Idiot and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours too.American Idiot and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours too.
0937381888|5.0|The problem with beer brewing books is that their relatively limited audience means that revised editions are few and far between.  Therefore, most books (e.g. The Complete Joy of Homebrewing) are seriously out of date.  Palmer's book is a classic and is relatively new.  He has organized the chapters perfectly--separate step by step \\"how-to's\\" for both extract and all-grain brewing that are augmented by more detailed and scientific discussions of the brewing process and the chemistry.  If you're a newbie, you must have this book.  If you are ready to jump to all-grain, you must have this book.  If you like reading about beer, you must have this book.  If you are highly advanced and have visions of starting your own brewery, you probably already have this book and have dog-eared the you-know-what out of it.    Highest recommendation--I wish there was a Winemaking counterpart.
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|I'm a great appreciator of Studio Ghibli, to the point of having all the output on DVD and visiting the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka (Japan).  This film is very pleasant but not groundbreaking. The transfer is good.  What enrages me though and loses this item 1 star is the decision by the wretched Disney (the anti-Ghibli in my opinion - oh the irony of it being them who have control of Ghibli's work in the west) to include an HD audio soundtrack for the (American) English dub but only a Dolby Digital 5.1 track for the (much preferred) Japanese original audio!  WHY?! This defies all logic and is an insult to those people who truly understand how a Ghibli movie should be presented. Disney are the McDonalds of the audio/visual world and treat their customers like nothing more than an income stream. Another case in point is the incredible number of unskippable trailers on Disney disc releases. How insulting to force me to watch the same trailers EVERY time I watch the movie I've paid for. Put the trailers in the extras options guys!
B0030Y11O2|1.0|It's that time of year again when the world freshens up, spring is in the air and the world comes alive. Well with the exception of the release of a new film by Michael Moore. Talk about a downer. Nothing fresh here but rather more Moore ranting about how terrible a country is that pays him millions of dollars to make movies that fewer and fewer people are going to see.<br /><br />CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY is anything but. What it basically boils down to is Moore's view that capitalism is an evil idea that should be abolished and replaced by socialism. So instead of a system that uses incentive to get people to work harder to make something of themselves, Moore would be happier if we all just tossed what we made into a pot and dispersed it equally to everyone. An easy thing to believe while being paid the amounts of money he gets.<br /><br />Moore uses several tactics that have worked for him before. The first is making fun of the stereotypical American family with mom, dad and the kids all living idyllic lives. He treats this as if it is a thing of the past, the good old days ruined now by corporate America.<br /><br />His next tactic is to label a bad guy, which in Moore's world are corporate big wigs. Their only concern seems to be making money for the company that they are in charge of, which is actually what they are paid to do. In Moore's eyes this should be about making money for the workers instead of the stockholders who invested money in the company to begin with.<br /><br />Then again he never notes that there are more pieces to the puzzle than he lists. Not mentioned are unions that got their employees more money/benefits that the company has to pay resulting in less money to go towards employees resulting in cut jobs or the state of the economy which would raise or lower the costs of goods, etc. But these aren't important to Moore who has an axe to grind, facts be damned!<br /><br />Moore pulls out his best trick several times: tugging at the heartstrings of the viewer. He does so here using his own father, walking with him down a broken sidewalk where the plant his father once worked in now stands demolished. When he asks his father what he remembers most, what his best memories of working there were he responds \\"The people\\".<br /><br />He also takes us to meet people who have been evicted from their homes. I have a great sympathy for anyone in this position. But Moore uses them, making them look like poor innocents who have been mistreated. With the exception of one family who fell on hard times, he never explains why they were forced into this position or even if the bank tried to work with them. Cue violins, pass the tissues.<br /><br />I will grant that documentaries are supposed to come with the film maker's point of view. But Moore has done such a shoddy job of avoiding numerous facts while using outlandish ones to support his ideas that it's become hard to take him seriously. He also tends to attempt to advance his ideas using emotions rather than facts. Toss in the fact that he's biting the hand that feeds him and you have to wonder why he continues or why those companies would give him money.<br /><br />Your politics and beliefs will skew the way you look at this film. At one time I was a big Moore fan, loved ROGER & ME (before I found out about the short cuts and alterations of truth contained in it), loved his TV series and thought Moore stood for something. The more I look deeper into the man and his films, the more I discover that he's less for telling the truth, for getting to the bottom of things and more about pushing an agenda. I was taught that documentaries were to promote and objective look at a topic with perhaps a slight tilt towards the beliefs of the film maker. In Moore's case we get all the film maker's beliefs and little objectivity.<br /><br />With several web sites taking the time to point out the twisting of facts and outright lies told in Moore's past films, one has to wonder just how much he's done so on this one. In this film he avoids the fact that greed, not capitalism, is the heart of the problem. And there is greed on both sides of the issue.<br /><br />Perhaps the only thing different about this film than others Moore has done is who he attacks. This time around he doesn't limit those to Republicans but goes after both sides. Chances are this will result in fewer people taking him seriously. Then again with the box office returns on this film, I think that's been demonstrated already.<br /><br />For a fair and objective observation on the topic, pass this one by. If you think capitalism is terrible though, you'll love it. And if you are a die hard Moore fan, you'll get what you are looking for.at greed, not capitalism, is the heart of the problem. And there is greed on both sides of the issue.     Perhaps the only thing different about this film than others Moore has done is who he attacks.

0385341008|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. You will fall in love with each and every character. Each with a unique voice. All charming. Do not think twice about reading this book. Just do it.
1400052173|5.0|This is an amazing, groundbreaking book. Though I've listed it under \\"biographies and memoirs,\\" that really doesn't do the book justice. It's part biography, part science, part ethics and philosophy. Rebecca Skloot seamlessly weaves the stories of Henrietta, her family, her cells, her doctors, and her cells' impact on science and ethics. The biographical parts are written with a blunt but sensitive pen, the science is explained clearly enough so that even someone like me -- who hasn't taken biology since 9th grade -- can follow it, if not truly grasp the deeper implications of it, and the ethical issues are laid out as precisely and clearly as possible.    I've never seen a book like this, that so easily and completely straddles the line between biography, science textbook, journalism, and metaphysical pondering. You know how Goodreads always asks \\"Who would you recommend this to?\\" I can't think of a single person who wouldn't connect with this book in some way, even if only for the ethical implications that we all have tissue taken from us, and none of us have a say in where it goes.
B002SF9YUM|4.0|I thought I was not going to like this film, but I was wrong, pleaseantly so I might add! I thought I had read/seen a lot about Salvador Dal&iacute; but this film made me want to do more research on him. He was a nutjob of a genious no doubt, he was eccentric, he was shy and an attention seeker at the same time. Spain at the time of his growing up was a social chaos and that influenced his early and formative years.<br />Now about the film I can say I believed in the character development and the beautiful photography of the settings. The screenplay could have been better as for the directing it was daring to say the least.<br />I gave it 5 stars for the subject matter but 4 overall.<br /><br />This film made me look for books on the subject of Lorca and Dal&iacute;, wish me luck as I journey into the madness of this poet and this crazy painter early discovery of their inner selves.<br />I recommend this film for every Dal&iacute; fan, it would give you a rare view of the mad man come into his crazy self.

I mean you know the story basically if you ordered it, so I'm not going to give a synopsis or w.e but if you order it, you wont be dissapointed. I told my boyfriend its an interesting display of the human psyche and the slow descent of henry into insanity, salacious activity, scandal and intrigue! :] haha.

There are several instances of brilliant songwriting throughout the album. It starts out strong with \\"Want\\" and ends with a truly amazing take on the end of a relationship \\"Bare.\\" Some gems from the rest of the album are the disillusioned \\"This is a Lie,\\" the heartbreaking \\"Treasure\\" and my personal favorite \\"Jupiter Crash\\" about an over-anticipated first sexual encounter (or if you can't read subtext, it's about a comet crashing into a planet). The album, much like its title, moves seamlessly from darker songs to happy songs (like \\"Mint Car\\" and \\"Strange Attraction\\"). Come on fellow Cure fans! You have to take some upbeat songs with your downers!
B001HN694K|4.0|Knowing that the actual story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are just weird stories to begin with (there's a caterpillar that is getting high and a cat that can disappear and that has a smile that stretches from ear to ear...literally), I always thought that Tim Burton would just be perfect as the director of a movie version.  So, when I heard that this was actually coming true, of course I would have to go see it.<br /><br />Sure, it was weird.  It seemed even weirder than any other Burton movie that I have seen (and I've seen a lot), but I think that had to do with the weirdness of the storyline combined with the weirdness of Burton.<br /><br />This particular version follows 19-year-old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as she returns to Underland (or Wonderland, as she called it when she was there the first time, at just 6-years-old).  That's an important thing to remember.  She has been there before and all of the characters have been waiting 13 years for her to come back down the rabbit hole and help to save Underland from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter [[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]]), who is the over-sized-headed evil sister of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway [[ASIN:B001E95ZNS Rachel Getting Married]]).  Alice teams up with other familiar characters such as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp [[ASIN:B00005JM5E Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]), the Cheshire Cat, and the White Rabbit in order to bring down the evil queen.<br /><br />Depp's makeup got some getting used to.  I found myself staring at his long, orange eyebrows more often than not.  I just really wanted to trim them.  But, once I pushed the old Disney version out of my mind, I found that I was able to enjoy it...with the one small exception of the character of Alice.  The girl in this movie just seemed so depressed and clueless and just *bleh* the entire time.  She talked about imagining the impossible and how she believed things could happen that other people didn't believe.  If that was the case, why did it take her about 4/5 of the movie before she finally accepted the fact that it wasn't just a dream?  I would've realized it the moment this weird creature almost sliced my arm off.  But, looking past the annoying main character's complete lack of excitement of being someplace like Underland/Wonderland/whatever you feel like calling it, I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I say that if you still aren't sure if you will like it, don't see it in 3D.

B002VECM4A|1.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night and found it to be a very depressing movie.  Yes Monique did a good job, but it was so depressing.  I'm very happy that she won an Oscar for best supporting actress in this film. Monique is a very talented Woman and did deserve to win an Oscar.    The beginning was very boring.  I would not recommend anyone to purchase this movie.  Yes these things really happens in real life.  This is a reality for a lot of people unfortunately, but I would not want to have this type of movie in my library.  I am so happy I did not go to the movie theater to watch this movie.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Updated: I have watched the movie twice now and can say that Ms. Bullock deserved the Oscar. However the films goodheartedness was reduced markedly by the cheap shot scene against President Bush. It had no real place in the film other than to give liberal Hollywood a shout out and kick Bush again as he left office. I am knocking off one star for the cheap shot. Other than that the film was very good.<br /><br />I have seen only a few scenes from the film and had planned on going to see it last year but on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson I saw the scene where Sandra's character goes to the Child Welfare Dept. in Tennessee to find out who is responsible for the problem in taking care of a homeless child. The worker points to a picture of President Bush ......cue laughter. After that I decided not to spend my money on another Hollywood film taking a cheap shot at Bush. The one thing he had no responsibility for was DCFS in Tennessee since its not a Federal department. Put a picture of the Governor of Tennessee Phil Bredesen a DEMOCRAT on the wall. I will wait and see it on HBO.

B002K0WBXW|3.0|Others may give this five stars, and I would have given this four, had not I just seen the new Criterion DVD release of Make Way for Tomorrow, with Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi, a classic from the 1930s which gives some hints on the kind of movie The Proposal might have been--a movie that deals honestly with the plight of the aged in our society.<br /><br />Grandma Annie is a woman from the hard country before Alaska was a state, and though near death today in a prosperous and tamed Sitka, her memories range widely back to the earliest days of white civilization, when it was just her and a bear, and the man she married long ago.  Her original wedding dress she has kept nicely pressed, in a style that recalls the suffragette age, with a soupcon of Isadora Duncan-inspired flowing robes to give it some classical spice.  For the wealthy Paxton family, Grandma Annie (nicely played by Betty White) is an authentic throwback not only to the days of the pioneers, but to an older people as well--the Indians.  In private she still performs the dances of the First Nations, calling on the spirit of the forests, the totem animals, and the surrounding oceans, to help her dance the way of the female shaman.<br /><br />Her family life is grim, so she keeps holding on to the dreams and memories, as do many elders in our society.  Her son (or son in law?  We couldn't decide) Joe Paxton, is a bitter tycoon for whom all the money in the world can't heal the thwarted desires in his heart.  His wife, Mary Steenburgen, feels weird when a woman pretty much her own age comes to her mansion and tells her she's engaged to Mary's son, a young stripling who has left the tribe and moved to New York, city of the big steeples.  Grandma Annie goes to the woods and makes tribal noises, having adapted the place to a stage set on which to perform her own performativity as a native woman.  Is she trying to make reparations, in her own quiet way, to the original Native settlers of the Sitka area?  We don't know.  The movie wastes a lot of time on its subplot, which involves the ponytailed city woman (Sandra Bullock) deciding that Alaska life isn't too bad in a hundred story mansion on the top of the hill with every retail outlet in the town bearing your name.<br /><br />Grandma Annie takes matters into her own hands at the dramatic conclusion, but my wife and I both felt disappointed that her struggles were trivialized, and that she was in the movie to make Sandra Bullock look like a younger actress than she is.<br /><br />It could have been a trailblazing cinematic document, and the best parts of it are!ovie wastes a lot of time on its subplot, which involves the ponytailed city woman (Sandra Bullock) deciding that Alaska life isn't too bad in a hundred story mansion on the top of the hill with every retail outlet in the town bearing your name.

B0000636UN|4.0|This is my fifth Sheryl Crow album. First I got [[ASIN:B00000JO1Z The Globe Sessions]], then [[ASIN:B000AOENCM Wildflower]], then after I enjoyed that album I actually picked up and dusted off The Globe Sessions and found it was my favorite album from Sheryl. [[ASIN:B000002G1T Tuesday Night Music Club]] came next and I liked some of the songs but it had a bit of filler. Not to mention Sheryl's voice wasn't quite up to snuff then. Later came [[ASIN:B000002G62 Sheryl Crow]]; great album and improved vocals. Shows her personality best probably. My second favorite from her.<br /><br />Now, just in time comes [[ASIN:B0000636UN C'mon, C'mon]]: a highly upbeat album which will get you in the mood for the lulling spring days and warm summer nights, cruising around in your car with the windows down with all your friends or even alone! It gives off such a positive vibe which was either welcomed to fans or seemed a bit forced at times (Guess some of us are just used to Sheryl being on the more sad side).<br /><br />'Steve McQueen', a solid rock number is the worst offender in this way. It's not a bad song per se, but the chorus really seems a bit forced. 'Soak Up The Sun' is next and it fairs a bit better. A feel-good jam for sure that happens to have been the first single off the album. 'You're An Original' featuring Lenny Kravitz on background vocals is really catchy also. One of my favorites off the album and can be put on repeat. 'Safe And Sound' is my second favorite off the U.S. release. It's very quiet and laid-back for most of the track, until the end where Sheryl grows into short screams. 'C'mon C'mon', the title track is one that still has to grow on me. I don't get the fuss about it really.<br /><br />Moving right along to the next track, 'It's So Easy' is another favorite. It's a smooth track featuring The Eagles's Don Henley. I love it. 'Over You' is a good one. Not my favorite but it's solid nonetheless. Sheryl and her ex-lover have clearly moved apart, but she finds herself pining for him even though she has a current lover. 'Lucky Kid' to me is the worst track here. I don't like the chorus much at all. Verses are OK but it just comes and goes - in and out of the ears. It's kind of a rocker though. Now onto 'Diamond Road' featuring Stevie again on backing vocals. I don't care what anyone else says, this one is a keeper. It's so positive and uplifting in its simplicity that you just have to love it. When you are feeling down, skip to track 9. Repeat if you have to. :)<br /><br />'It's Only Love' is another laid-back tune. A mid-tempo. Not much to say about it but it's very listenable. Features Gwyneth Paltrow on background vocals. Yes, her. The actress... 'Abilene' is my favorite track here. Sheryl loves to name songs after girls that are going through situations. This song is no different. Abilene is a girl who \\"has the weight of the world on her shoulders\\" and needs a break. Sheryl tells her that she doesn't have to carry it on her own. Great track. Love the melody. 'Hole In My Pocket' is probably the catchiest track here thanks to the chorus. It's another favorite of mine and has Sheryl talking about a love that she wasted, \\"You know I/I got a hole in my pocket/You give me love and I drop it/I guess I'll throw it away\\". It's also the last of the upbeat tracks for Sheryl ends the CD on a more somber note. \\"Weather Channel\\" is one long sentence it seems. There isn't really a chorus. But it's really worth hearing. I wish there were 1 or 2 more songs that were less upbeat, but I guess that's the point of the album. It is made for sunny, positive days.<br /><br />If you have an import version, you are likely to have songs entitled, 'I Want You' and 'You're Not The One'. The former is an OK song, but I don't remember it much. The latter is pretty forgettable. It features Stevie Nicks AGAIN. The real gem that should have been included on ALL albums, is track number 14, 'Missing'. That one alone beats out all of the tracks thatI have mentioned in this review. It's perfection. Even better than 'Safe And Sound'. I put that song on repeat the most.<br /><br />Here's a quick rating of each song on the album. I didn't count 'Missing' into the final rating.<br /><br />1.

0307271862|1.0|I read it and have no idea what this book was about. I was ready to settle in with a great mystery after the first 50 or so pages and it then veered off in such a disjointed manner that I had to keep going back to pages I had previously read to see if I had missed something. The long narratives about China were so flatly written that I kept skipping through them, hoping the mystery with which Mankell began the book would at some point reappear. Also the idea that the Swedish judge would go to Beijing and simply bump into the mysterious Chinese man of whom she has a picture is so far fetched as to be laughable. Talk about a needle in a haystack. All I can say is that this was/is a major disappointment.

0545123267|5.0|Grace is a seventeen year old girl fascinated with the wolves residing in the forest behind her house.  When she was younger, she was brutally attacked by said wolves, only to be saved by one particular golden eyed pack member.  This wolf has been her obsession for the past six years.    Lucky her when, after a \\"brutal murder\\", this golden-eyed creature shows up on her doorstep.  As a human.  With a gunshot wound to the neck.    After rushing Sam to the hospital, only to discover his super human healing abilities, the duo are plagued by one particular problem: the closer it gets to winter, the more susceptible Sam is to the change back to wolf.  Will they figure out a way to save the young boy before it's too late?      Any book that can get me invested enough that angst-y scenes make me cry or almost cry has claimed a special place in my heart.  Shiver is a new addition to this select list.  It is so beautifully written that I'm actually sad that I finished it today, even though I was dying to see what would happen with Sam and Grace.    My favorite character is Isabel.  She seemed like some prissy little snob, but once she was integrated into the group, she was hilarious.  I had to slap a hand over my mouth quite a few times today in order to keep my squeals of laughter quiet because of some of the things she said.    Grace and Sam compliment each other perfectly.  Grace is confident and sexy, while Sam's the little insecure emo kid.  His flip flopping between being shy/insecure and wanting to kiss Grace senseless got me frustrated at one point, only because it felt like they were so far in their relationship already for him to act like that with her.

B0026O475M|5.0|Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie about him who works for FedEx and while he is flying on a FedEx plane the plane has problem with its cargo and the plane crashes into the Pacific. Hanks lives and survives for four years on a island and after the four years makes his escape with Wilson who is a volleyball that he talks to. I remember seeing this in the theater and when he finally makes fire the audience clapped for him.  You will actually cheer for him while he learns to survive on some remote island in the Pacific, I believe it was.  The ending will have wondering which way he turns either North, South, East, or West, I believe that is how life is.  This movie is a must see.

1592242863|5.0|I read a paperback version of this with an introduction by Ernst Mayr. Not so sure if this is the same version...<br /><br />It's interesting to watch modern artists as the (perceived?) quality of their work decreases over time: people declare a particular album or book or season of a show to be the high water mark, from which the creator then recedes away. This same trend is interestingly also present in On the Origin of Species (OTOOS). By the time Darwin had hit the sixth edition (which I had previously read) he has been attacked directly and indirectly by the near entirety of contemporary Western science. In particular the attacks of Lord Kelvin had lent what some considered to be a death blow to the idea of an amazingly old Earth, which Darwin (as a 'devout' Lyellian) needed for the most basic of his explanations of natural selection. By the sixth edition, Darwin had retreated further and further into needing \\"Neo\\"-Lamarckian methods and thinking to explain how life has been able to evolve.<br /><br />The first edition is Darwinian evolution as its least diluted: in this version evolution is a slow but unrelenting giant that unconsciously guides life forward towards... well, the future, where different forms either flourish or die, as nature is indifferent to the struggles of its inhabitants.<br /><br />The good: the first edition is OTOOS as Darwin intended it to be: daring, sometimes brash, but always brave and easy to understand. This particular printing is larger than pocket size but perfect for a small bag or purse or cargo pants pocket. Lots of space on every page for you to write down your comments, which you will have, trust me. Darwin wrote this to get a reaction, and that he still can 150 years later is a testament to the power of his argument.<br /><br />The bad: It's not the a variorum text published by University of Pennsylvania Press. That text is probably _the_ definitive version of Darwin's seminal work, as it shows how OTOOS evolved over time.<br /><br />The ugly: It's funny (in a sad way) to read Darwin taking down the arguments of today's Discovery Institute / Intelligent Design talking heads from 150 years ago. And, yes, sure, Darwin sometimes writes in a manner that takes a few reads to grok. Just do what he did when his mind was bothered: go for a walk, enjoy nature, watch ants. Come back after a few minutes and the text will flow more easily. ...if not then maybe just try skimming for a few paragraphs. ;)<br /><br />Rent or Buy: Completely worth the purchase unless you somehow feel like you will only read the single most important book in biological history once.d way) to read Darwin taking down the arguments of today's Discovery Institute / Intelligent Design talking heads from 150 years ago.

B0035J6TAI|3.0|I was hoping that after 8 years he would come out with an album of his own songs (where is &#34;I/O&#34;?), but anyway...  I honestly had some trepidations about an album of &#34;covers&#34;.  Nevertheless, any new release by Peter Gabriel is worth looking forward to, and I was actually not too disappointed.  Gabriel takes a very eclectic mix of songs from very different songwriters. His vocal performances are all great, of course.  The instrumentation - an orchestra with occasional piano, and perhaps some electronics - no drums or guitars - certainly gives the songs a different spin.  Among Peter Gabriel's talents is his ability to create interesting soundscapes. He is in fact a pioneer in that regard.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this album has  serious flaws to it.  First of all, the material is, IMO, not equally strong.  There is, as other reviewers have commented, a certain &#34;sameness&#34;, not only in the orchestration, but particularly in the tempo.  I listen to plenty of orchestral music, and it is most definitely possible to make orchestral music rhythmically more dynamic (Varese, Stravinsky, etc.).  The result is a couple of somewhat dull patches.  Still, there are enough highlights.  Gabriel's take on Paul Simon's &#34;Boy in the Bubble&#34; is a highlight. I very much like the original, but Gabriel truly re-invents it in a fascinating way.  Some of the darker aspects of the lyrics hit you in the face in a way that they did not with the bouncy, South African influenced original.  His cover of Bowie's &#34;Heroes&#34;, while interesting, doesn't hold a candle to the original, nor could it ever, to be fair.<br /><br />In summary, I give it 3 stars, mainly because I know what he can do, and I cannot rank this at the top among Gabriel albums. But still, as with all his stuff, it's definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />The concert at the Hollywood Bowl was great, and knowing him, we can probably look forward to a DVD of the tour, which will be well-worth getting.the Kinks'\\"Waterloo Sunset\\", which is a treat.    In summary, I give it 4 stars, mainly because I know what he can do, and I cannot rank this at the top among Gabriel albums. But still, as with all his stuff, it's definitely worth checking out.    The concert at the Hollywood Bowl was great, and knowing him, we can probably look forward to a DVD of the tour, which will be well-worth getting.
0307266303|5.0|Interesting, to me anyway, that I sit here feeling pain in my left sole, because this book is about many things, and one of them is the source of foot pain.  This book is also about running, particularly long distance running, and about how man evolved (or was born) to run.  The story is a fascinating account of how the author, Christopher McDougall, made his way to the Cooper Canyon in Mexico, the home of the fabled Tarahumara runners, who run long distances daily as a matter of course, so to speak, and have few to no injuries despite running in huaraches made from rubber tires.  What's up with that?  Aren't the latest $200 running shoes supposed to prevent injuries and turn us in better runners? No, in fact, running shoes turn us into worse runners and lead to more injuries.  Running shoes cause our feet to work in abnormal ways, in particular landing on our heels, among other things.  It is more natural to run barefoot, or at least with minimalist shoes that don't provide excess cushioning.    McDougall, a writer for Men's Health magazine, recounts his journey to the Tarahumaras and his encounter with Caballo Blanco, an American living in the mountains of Copper Canyon, emulating the Tarahumara's running and life style.  As he tells the tale leading to the planned showdown between the Tarahumaras and elite American ultra-runners, McDougall takes us through the history of running, focusing particularly on the main characters, often eccentric, from the world of ultra-running.  It is a fascinating story bolstered by the underlying theme and message that man evolved to run long distances.  The way various individuals from various disciplines arrived at this conclusion is gripping, so I will not reveal it here.    McDougall is a terrific writer, although occasionally he overreaches in his attempt to capture the exact tone and attitude of his subjects, sounding more like he's mimicking rather than reflecting his subject's persona.  Nevertheless, McDougall gets the reader right into the thick of things, as he describes the grueling trails and the physical challenges encountered by ultra-runners.  At the same time, the reader is motivated to get up, get out and get running, after understanding how natural it really is for us to do it.  The \\"freaks\\" who seem so out there running bizarrely long distances so constantly are suddenly transformed into the one's who've got it right.    This book also adds to the discussion of man's purpose as reflected in his evolution.  We are born not only to run, but to run together and for a communal purpose.  Would that we could also walk and work side by side for other worthy endeavors.

B001DZDTUO|5.0|I love the CD, it was a good price. I am how ever considering not ever using Amazon again. They have started using a delivery company called Velocity Express which repeatedly asked me to come pick it up, with no delivery attempt. When I refused to come pick it up they sent it back, more than once, with more than one product. After complaining to Amazon they sent it again. Velocity Express just refused to deliver to me while, UPS, FEDEX, DHL, and the USPS are all quit happy to deliver to my door. Why not Velocity Express? When they finally did bring it, they sat in the car, called my on my phone (not happy about that either) and told me to come out and get it, while they sat in the car. (kind of made it look like a drug deal) Quit frankly the delivery people scared me a little, worried about getting robbed by them.   Amazon shipped through them even when I requested any other service. I canceled my Premium services over this and am considering not buying from Amazon again because of it.If I have to go pick it up, I might as well go to the store to get it, the only real advantage Amazon holds for me is that the products are delivered to my door. If the delivery service will not do that, then what advantage is there in Amazon?
B001AQT11M|3.0|This movie has a lot of charm, but sometimes it's a little boring.<br /><br />Snow White is cute and all. And she has an alright personality. But I feel this movie lacks some of the perfection that other titles such as [[ASIN:B000JBWWRY Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000F8O35U The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)]] had.<br /><br />The animals add a lot to the overall innocent feel to the movie. And like I said, Snow White has the perfect, girl-next-door personality.<br /><br />I'm sure I was watching the restored version, but from what I did see, the movie has aged really well considering it was from 1937. That was 72+ years ago!<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching them all dance with Snow White. It was cute.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie for kids and some adults to enjoy. Grumpy's comments and Dopey's actions were the funniest.<br /><br />3.75 stars or a 7.5/10.
143350393X|4.0|What I like about this bible is that in all of my studies they often reference the \\"true\\" translation of the words and it happens to be the actual word that the ESV bible uses.  This has occurred at least 10 times in the last month since I purchased my new bible.  It makes me feel like I'm reading the most accurate translation.  The only negative is that the Tru-tone seems to scratch fairly easily, although it is a very attractive  looking bible.  I am very pleased so far and it was a good price.
B0026UV77C|3.0|Battle for the Sun being Placebo's 6th studio album and 2009 release is a mix of alternative rock and Post-punk revival. The album was met with mix reviews by the critics. Rolling Stone gave it 2.5/5 and Allmusic 3/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with photographs of the band. The album peaked the charts in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Four singles have been released so far from the album, i.e., \\"For What It's Worth\\", \\"The Never-Ending Why\\", \\"Ashtray Heart\\" and \\"Bright Lights\\". To me too many songs sound alike and that is not a good thing since to be frank this release is not all that interesting. Sill good enough to get 3/5. 3/5.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Years ago when I first heard about a possible Phantom follow-up, I'll be the first to admit that I was extremely worried and when I heard that Lloyd Webber was going to base the story off of Phantom of the Manhattan I was disappointed. The book was horrible! So, out of complete curiosity I bought the MP3 album and to my surprise it wasn't too bad. Mind you there aren't too many showstopping numbers in the score, in my opinion. The Phantom's song with Gustave (The Beauty Underneath) was nothing but a poor attempt to recapture the magic of the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" from the original. But none the less it was cool. If you want to listen to a interesting score, be my guest you won't be disappointed.   (Well, minus the Phans, lol.)

B00004KD11|3.0|F2 *     While uneven, and in spots just not very good, Deep Purple's first album showed the talent of its key members, and gave a taste of what they would later accomplish.  While the songs show off Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore's respective skills with keyboard and guitar, they do a fairly poor job of marrying the two.  While the band's later style still depended heavily on Jon Lord (he famously said that the sound of Deep Purple \\"has a hell of a lot to do with my organ\\"), this first album (and the Mark I period) were much more centered around that sound.  All in all, a must for Deep Purple fans, but a toss-up for casual listeners.    The standout tracks are:   \\"And the address\\" - an exception in that it blends rock and classical nicely in a catchy, upbeat track.  \\"Hush\\" - a version of Joe South's song that became Deep Purple's first hit.  \\"One more rainy day\\" - a light pop track.  \\"Mandrake root\\" - copying Jimi Hendrix, but giving a feeling for the hard rock the band would eventually move to.    * Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album.  F1 is an indication that only diehard, compulsive collectors are likely to want the album.  F5 indicates that a complete newcomer to the band would appreciate it.
0307271862|3.0|Henning Mankell is an excellent writer of detective stories. His Kurt Wallender stories are superb, but here he tries to do too much. It's a detective story - kind of  - along with a story of the Chinese building the Central Pacific Railway in 1863, plus some observations on Mao's Cultural Revolution of the 1960-70s plus a thriller ending that really doesn't belong; and the combination just doesn't work. Mr. Mankell should go back to Kurt Wallender and leave thrillers to Jack Higgins and Frederick Forsyth and Tom Clancy -  and history to the historians.     There's nothing wrong with the start. One winter day all the occupants of a small Swedish village are found badly butchered - all of them. (Side note: I couldn't locate any of the towns mentioned in my National Geographical Atlas.) There are no suspects, but a middle aged Swedish judge - Birgitta Roslyn - is distantly related to the occupants of one household and, intrigued with the police investigation. she and pretty much starts a one woman off the record and behind the door investigation on her own. And she's pretty good at it. So far, so good. Mankell is on track.     Suddenly, however, we are told a second story. It's 1863 and San, a 20 year old Chinese peasant, is kidnapped by the Chinese mafia and roped to a gang of Chinese slave laborers tunneling through the Sierras for the Central Pacific in the winter. Surviving incredible hardships (emphasis on the word incredible) he makes it back to China where we leave him. (However, we know he had a cruel Swedish foreman.)      Then we return to the present.  Birgitta is on leave from her judicial duties because of stress but is able to continue he investigation, which is leading to a result contrary to that which the police have just concluded. Her investigation leads to a man from China who spent one night - the night of the murders - in a hotel in the small town in question. And she has a picture of him. Still so far so good - a detective story. But now the story starts to go off the rails.     One of her friend is going o China for a conference and Birgitta, still under stress, decides to go along. Before long she's shadowed, attacked, threatened and scared. And we're never sure exactly who is who or where is where. Frankly I defy the ordinary reader to keep track of, much less follow, the next literary meanderings, of all the sinister events which are interspersed with little essays having nothing to do with the story - Mankell on Mao, Mankell on history, Mankell on China etc.      Okay, we've gone from little towns in Sweden in winter to The Sierras in winter, then to China in winter and now we go to Zimbabwe in \\"summer\\" where the Chinese are seeking to colonize a large part of this beautiful country to relieve population pressures; and now we have a lot of Jack Higgins, Frederick Forsyth, Tom Clancy action which I could have done without. And we also have so far as I know the only bit of literature in existence which has had anything nice to say about Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe. (Note: Mankell lives most of he time in Maputo, fight across the border in Mozambique.) Finally there is an ending. We know who did it and why, And Birgitta is going back to the bench. And her stress problem? We just don't know. But if you read the book maybe you can figure it out.
B000005RQT|4.0|F4 *    With \\"In Rock\\", Deep Purple introduced their most famous Mark II lineup, and an entirely different sound.  Gone were the smooth vocals and the pop sound of the Mark I period, making way for Ian Gillan's \\"silver throated screams\\".  The balance within the band also altered drastically, with Ritchie Blackmore's guitar clearly at the fore, and Jon Lord sadly playing a markedly lesser role.  While this led to terrific hard rock songs, and the band's biggest commercial success, the overall sound was also less subtle and interesting than before.      As a hard rock album, In Rock is a huge success, from the opening blast of \\"Speed King\\" to the final notes of \\"Hard loving man\\".  While the songs are of uneven quality, the band had clearly come into its own as rockers, and they did it with style.  The anniversary version contains mildly interesting studio chat, but also two great songs not on regular albums - \\"Black night\\" and \\"Cry free\\".    Key tracks:  \\"Speed king\\" - infamously said to be originally titled \\"Kneel and pray\\", the song introduces the band's new hard rock sound with panache.  While Ian Gillan's screaming vocals are the center, there's a strong instrumental section, showing off Blackmore's new dedication to rock solos, and not entirely forgetting Jon Lord's keyboard influence on the band.  \\"Child in time\\" - a maga-hit for the band, showcasing the more melodic side of Gillan's screaming vocals.  While the classical influences of earlier albums had been banished, Jon Lord was still a key figure in the band, demonstrated by the delicate opening lines of this ballad.    \\"Flight of the rat\\" - a surprisingly overlooked rocker with great keyboard and guitar solos.  \\"Cry free\\" - previously released as part of compilations (e.g., Powerhouse), this is a great, slightly softer rock song with a driving drum beat and more singing than screaming by Gillan.    * Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album.  F1 is an indication thatonly diehard, compulsive collectors are likely to want the album.  F5 indicates that a complete newcomer to the band would appreciate it.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe, he of the bushy, burgeoning unibrow), is no match for Twilight's Edward Cullen.  Oh sure, Harry's hormones are raging now, severely compromising his efforts to thwart the powers of darkness that have beset his young life, but it all feels so unnatural, as if the boy wizard's inablility to keep it in his pants is merely a ploy by the producers to fend off the REAL threat to Harry's future:  the massively successful Twilight franchise.  You've had your day Harry, so take a hike before the vampires come for you!

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Love this version of Emma - I think Romola Garai is great in the title role and all her male counterparts are quite easy on the eyes! Plus, the costumes and setting are sumptuous!    I will say that this DVD does not come with many special features, but this is a great price for it nonetheless.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This novel is paced well and has its exciting parts but I think the story is a little weak and lacking.  Plus, it trails off into absolute drivel.  I may skip his next book if he bothers to write another.

0394721780|5.0|I have enjoyed trying some of the recipes from this book.   The book is important enjoyable on more than one level.  I came to this cookbook by way of reading the recent autobiography by Julia Child, \\"My Life in France\\" which I high recommend.  One of the goals of this cookbook was to preserve an important part of French culture.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and never get tired of seeing it again.    This is in my opinion one of the best Cary Grant, movies and the fact that it was directed by Alfred Hichcock, only makes it better.  The \\"Blue-ray 50th Anniversary Edition\\", is well worth it's price.   The book form it comes in makes it an even more pleasant surprise, with the behind the scenes photo's of the cast between takes and the information it gives you in the book.    This is a true Movie Buff's must have in their library.  You can not go wrong with the purchase of this movie.

B00328G4XY|4.0|The album was a masterpiece when it was released, and remains so.  There are some passages of 60's-era experimental, drug-suffused one-upsmanship, lending an occasionally dated quality.  For the most part, though, the carefully crafted, inventive character of the album remains timeless.  Especially at ~$9, this is a must-have for those who lack this album in their collection.  (Stevie Ray Vaughan fans will appreciate the shared sensibilities and vision of these two virtuoso guitarists, each having left us far too soon.)    The CD is clearly a remaster of the original recording, and may be a partial remix as well.  The equalization, dynamics, and stereo separation is generally more appealing to the contemporary (i.e., digital-era) ear, though the latter seems to be even more exaggerated than the original (to my recollection).  Many of the shortcomings and idiosyncrasies of analog multitracking of that time are quite apparent.  What would now be regarded as poor production values underscores the creativity required decades ago to produce such rich, multi-layered compositions with limited technical means.  Even though the remaster is strikingly different, I like that the integrity of the recordings was largely maintained - e.g., the amplifier hum behind the lead vocals.  Breathing of the noise floor due to compression is occasionally distracting, but it is largely a successful balance between preservation and enhancement.    I already had a remaster dating from the late 1990's - haven't had a chance to do a A/B comparison, but I'm not convinced that this release (if it is different at all) warrants getting another copy, if you already have the earlier remaster.  I bought it because of the accompanying DVD mini documentary.  Clocking in at around 12 minutes, the emphasis should be squarely on the \\"mini\\" part.  The interview with Eddie Kramer is somewhat interesting, but the DVD was mostly disappointing, both for its brevity and lack of development.    Those looking forfootage of Hendrix himself will find only a few seconds of concert snips.  Even lacking that, there is little narrative flow or depth to the story.  A half-a**ed effort.    I highly recommend this to those who don't have the album, and recommend it to those who only have the original CD (or LP).  If you're looking for significant value added over the earlier remaster, especially from the DVD, I wouldn't bother, unless you are obsessed with anything Hendrix.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I saw portions of this movie while on a road trip through various cities several years ago and had always wanted to see the full version. I wanted to get to a town or city where I could watch the whole movie but it never worked out. In fact, most of the time I would see almost the same section and could never get to the ending because of time constraints or whatever. I finally saw a chance of seeing the whhole movie by going through Amazon and have really enjoyed the movie. I have watched Office Space a few times now and can't get over the number of personalities in the movie that mimic a few people I have worked with over the years. Sometimes I watch the movie before I go into work and then start giggling to myself when one of my coworkers acts like one of the characters in the movie. The movie has proved to be a great get away and I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a laugh.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I am well pleased with this movie. I've never bought anything used before like this without seeing it first. The outer slip cover for the actual case was even with it and in GREAT condition. The disc doesn't even look like it had been touched either. I am glad I decided to purchased this used. My daughter really enjoys dance movies and both Step Up movies are her favorites.
B002ZTIILC|4.0|Many people will probably dismiss this album after hearing a track or two. Honestly, I wouldn't blame them, but it would be a shame.<br /><br />Half the lyrics are deeply-felt and earnest but slightly-comical, like those of generations of college sophomores who think they're the first to experience an intellectual and moral awakening. (Think Avril Lavigne without the attitude or Bono without the poetry.) The other half are mostly just banal. Even the worst songs have the occasional clever turn of phrase, though: \\"I'm obsessed with the mess that's America\\" (from Hollywood) has been running through my brain all week. And, in her own defense, Diamandis would probably say (as in I Am Not a Robot) \\"better to be hated than loved, loved, loved for what you're not\\".<br /><br />The music is also in some ways simply standard pop fare, right down to a very hot mix presumably designed to compete with the over-processed garbage that currently infests the airwaves. But at least the elements stuffed into that mix are tasty, from some clever sequencer riffs to an honest-to-goodness string section. In fact, at times the production rises to the level of something between Imogen Heap and one of the better synth-happy 80s acts.<br /><br />Ultimately, Diamandis is, if not wholly original, too quirky to be pigeonholed. Think Lene Lovich meets Tori Amos, with a pinch of Kate Bush and a dash of Feist. The first song I heard from this album was \\"I Am Not a Robot\\", and for me it's the most interesting and charming of the 13 tracks on the UK release. (As I write this, the US release is still months away.) It has something of the same flavor as Yael Naïm's [[ASIN:B000ZZUW4O New Soul]] or Feist's [[ASIN:B000RPSVIG 1234]] (certainly a plus in my book), but I think the reason I like it best is that we actually get to hear Diamandis' voice--and its an interesting voice, worth hearing.<br /><br />So, buy this album or not, but I'd recommend checking out at least \\"I Am Not a Robot\\". And I'm looking forward to hearing what Marina & the Diamonds' does next.& the Diamonds' does next.
B001KZVQJI|3.0|This review is based on my original viewing of the King Kong DVD and I have to say that while I'm sure that the Blu-ray is gorgeous, I have a problem with Jack Black. The character of Carl Denham should have had a different actor. Jack Black, while I have no reason to doubt that he seems to be a funny comedian, lacks any serious acting skills to pull off this character as being believable.    Hollywood continues to remake classic television shows or remake movies like that of King Kong and Godzilla and end up failing to deliver a quality product. The problem is that Hollywood directors like to transform classic properties into a comedy movie and everytime they do this, they always manage to create a piece of crap that fails to give Hollywood any good standing. Starsky and Hutch, Charlie's Angels, Bewitched, Brady Bunch, The Flintstones ... they were all pale imitations, at best. The problem is that King Kong employs a whole cast of serious actors and Jack Black tries so hard to at serious acting that he often falls flat on his face.    Robin Williams, Jim Carey ... even George Carlin, all serious and very funny comedians, managed to develop a serious acting side and pulled together some very good dramatic movies and they even succeeded at expanding their talents as serious actors. However, Jack Black needed to showcase this side of his acting ability and he simply fails miserably. Here, he seems to be a round peg trying to fit into a square.    The one thing I have to credit is Peter Jackson who producing a very good movie. However, in trying to create a different movie, I think maybe made a bad casting mistake in regards to Jack Black. Two and one half hours was bad enough but now everyone gets to agonize through over three hours of bad acting from Jack Black. I can think of better King Kong movies to watch than his bad acting.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The final season of this enjoyable ends with some unanswered questions:  Will Luke and Lorelai ever hook up?  Will Chris stay away for good?  Will Jackson and Sookie ever stop having kids?  Will Michel ever get a life outside of the inn?  Will Kirk remain the Stars Hollow oddball for the rest of his life?  Will Taylor ever get over himself?  Will Paris drive everyone insane in her quest to become a doctor?   Will Lane ever get to go on the road again?    Also, it never made much sense to have Lorelai and Chris back together.  And Logan should not have put Rory on the spot the way he did.    However, this is still a very enjoyable final season for a consistently good show with rapid-fire dialogue and quirky characters.
0307386171|4.0|While this novel is far and away better than Amsterdam, it doesn't compare with his best novels, like Atonement and Enduring Love. On Chesil Beach is a minor, well written novel, with the pacing and characterization you'd expect from McEwan. One of the things I liked about Chesil Beach was the fact that for the most part it was a very un-sentimental book, until the last five or so pages, which had enough sentimentality for the entire novel. While it may not leave you feeling blown away like Atonement, Enduring Love, or (at least for me) The Cement Garden, On Chesil Beach is a good read for a fan of McEwan. If your new to him this isn't the book I would pick up, but it's certainly worth your time. It's short, powerful, and to the point. It may fall short of greatness, but it's very good.

0316776963|2.0|I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" with different expectations that I probably should have had.  I was expecting a novel, but I got a bunch of short stories.  I HATE short stories, but that's my own fault for not researching more before I picked it up, right?<br /><br />So, I grin and bear it for a few stories, but then feel like maybe I'm reading an Augusten Burroughs novel instead?  I know technically \\"Me Talk...\\" came out at the same time as \\"Running With Scissors\\", both originally released in 2001, but the stories are so similar to Augusten's that I had to go back and check the covers.  Yup.  Sedaris.  Okay... moving on.<br /><br />Yeah, he's funny.  Sure he has some great moments.  But, is he really as funny as HE thinks HE is?<br /><br />If I had read this book BEFORE reading Augusten Burroughs's books... maybe I would have loved it a little more.  I honestly DID love \\"Naked\\" by Sedaris- laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />But \\"Me Talk...\\" just wasn't... good.

B00316DDWW|5.0|Compared to their earlier album \\"Themata\\", this one takes a couple listens to truly \\"get it\\". What I mean by that is that it's very deep, atmospheric, and powerful. After the 3rd listen through it's just truly amazing. The guys have really surpassed their earlier efforts while managing to keep their identity and sound, something many bands struggle with. It's still heavy in many spaces, but it's definitely more diverse and dynamic; more three dimensional, if you will.     Overall, I cannot recommend this album enough. It was well worth the wait to get it in the States.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I was bowled over by the authentic Boston look, accents and the real people cast in this crime drama, based on a Dennis Lahane novel, directed by Ben Affleck. The beginning works extremely well, and the film seems to be over halfway through, but then takes a few more plot turns before the ending, which doesn't work for me. Casey Affleck is very good as the central character, and his accent is perfect because he grew up in Dorchester. I just thought the plot lost some credibility as it went on: have real police ever been involved in a kidnapping to try to save a child from neglect? I really doubt it. Otherwise, this is first-rate, and moves along without any dead space whatsoever. Extremely entertaining and watchable, despite the plot weakness.
0743455967|4.0|I read this book just for fun. I am not a writer, but I have considered giving it a shot. King gives plenty of advice to the aspiring writer, pulling examples from his life and his experiences in the literary world. The author gives general advice and guidelines as well as specific point by point instruction. I have not put in the time that King recommends, but I imagine anyone who followed the advice in this book would be able to write something at least marginally decent. It was a good read, notwithstanding.
1592402038|5.0|Punctuation as Delight    Lynn Truss is a bright and charming writer.  I owned this book earlier when it was first published, causing quite a stir in the British reading public.  It was a delight, often funny, always informative, and always lifting the English language to the high place it deserves in our intellectual life.  It was a book I wanted to share with someone I thought would enjoy it.  I loaned the book; the person I loaned it to passed it on.  After a year of absence from my book shelves, I made inquiries about that book without a successful return.  I needed another copy and Amazon provided that service.  I now have a softback copy to which I may return to gain assurance that punctuation matters; that correct speech and written language matter; and, once again, to know that knowledge is power and great fun!
B0032KNA4I|2.0|This movie is ok however the blue ray disk sucks!!! This companies keep making discs that won't play on Power DVD version 8 and prompt you to buy version 9 so they can make more $$. [...]  I have Music CD's and I can play 10 years old cd on any CD player and they play. Now with this Blu Ray disk you have to keep updating the software or it won't play. It will play on the Sony PS3 made by Sony but not on your computer even if you have Power DVD. This really sucks!!  I won't to blog sites and a lot of people are having the same problem with this movie. It starts but there is no menu to play the movie so you can not see it.  This companies sould get a class action suit so they can start making products that you can use in any Blue ray player.
0441014054|5.0|I read \\"Dune\\" when I was in college, almost forty five years ago, but I<br />still occasionally 'flash back' to its depiction of life in a world where<br />water is extremely scarce.

B000F1IQNC|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by an elderly lady, to whom it was recommended to her by her grandchild.  turns oout to be a very good movie ,good story line, good production.
B002I9Z8DK|5.0|I'll say first that I'm a heretic. I think this is the best of the original series movies; I prefer it to Wrath of Kahn.  You've got the best of TOS here; the friendly three way conflict between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. The enjoyable over acting by Shatner, character driven conflicts...it's the best elements of star trek. There's not one big villain but rather an ad-hoc group threatened by a loss in power and prestige with the outbreak of peace.  The Cold War overtones are hard to miss for me, as a history buff, but they don't detract from the movie.  I rather like this style of villain(s); they're not evil masterminds but simply people threatened by changes. It's far more believable than some of the uber-villains in other Trek movies.     The treatment that this got on Blu-Ray I'd call the gold standard.  I've seen better picture and audio quality, particularly from Pixar...but this is still *very* good, far better than many.  No artificating, sounds great on my speakers (A decent 2.1 setup attached to a Harmon receiver) and looks wonderful on my 50\\" 1080p set.  It's probably as good as they could do with the source material.      The extras...oh man did they do us justice.  Here's a note to other movie stuidos: If you do extras, do them like this. I can't summarize them all in this review, but they went heavy on the documentary/interview stuff as well as including the traditional directory commentaries.  I enjoyed the one about Klingons, Shakespear and translations between the two...that was just classic.  There's 3 or 4 hours all told of documentary footage, with intelligent, informative commentary.  For a Trek fan those alone would almost be worth the purchase price.  They talk with costume designers, linguist, FX, stuntmen, actors...it's amazing to see what really goes into a major motion picture.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book is short and to the point. It has everything you could ever need in experienced advice in a brilliantly separated way. The simple fact that I got it and was done reading it in 5hrs speaks volumes about it's quality. I just couldn't put it down. Everything just makes sense. And even better, it's applicable! It's not just some advice spewed out by people making theories on what they think will work. It's actual experience being given to you on what does work and what doesn't.<br /><br />This is definitely a book everyone should read. Doesn't matter if you're starting a business, already running a business, or just sitting around in a cubicle. This book applies to everyone and anyone.
B00158K0S8|5.0|I'll leave it to others to praise the acting, the accuracy, etc.  For me one of the best things about this DVD is the quality of the transfer.  With Blu-ray, there are times I can actually see the grain of the film!  Every shot reminds us that WWII, and the world, existed in glorious color, not grainy black-and-white.  Blue skies, white snow, mud and muck, all show up vibrantly.  I'd buy this DVD just to impress people with what Blu-ray brings to the party; the fact that it also includes one of the greatest performances on film is almost an add-on.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|A must-have for your collection. Mysteriously, over the years I had never seen the complete movie. We miss Hitchcock so much.
B0035J6TA8|2.0|I am a long time fan of Peter Gabriel's work, but I have to say this is a dissapointment. The hole album is very plain, with the notable of Listening Wind, but even then I keep imagening where Tony Levin or Manu Katche could come in and make the a good song a great song. However, in all of his albums I end up liking the songs I dismiss at the beginning and dismissing the ones I like....but somehow it doesn't feel that way this time.
B00004SZWD|5.0|SITKOF is the fifth album from what is known as Stevie wonder's \\"Classic Period,\\" preceded by \\"Music Of my Mind,\\" \\"Talking book,\\" \\"Innervisions,\\" and \\"Fulfillingness First Finale.\\"  This 21 song collector's album has Stevie playing many tracks on his own while making much more use of additional top-notch musicians on the others.  Lyrically wise, Stevie doesn't miss a beat.  You get so much of what he's famous for, calls for love and peace (\\"Love's In Need Of Love Today\\"), biting social commentary (\\"Village Ghetto Land\\", \\"Saturn\\"), and soothing balladry (\\"As\\", \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\" and \\"If It's Magic\\").  \\"Sir Duke\\" is a perky tribute to the \\"Big Band\\" era and \\"I Wish\\" is a catchy, some would say funny, childhood remimiscence.  \\"Black Man\\" is a shout-out to the contributions that people of all races and genders have made to the world with a slamming funky groove!  SITKOF even includes two instrumentals, the jazzy, uptempo \\"Contusion\\" and the mellow, harmonica-driven \\"Easy Goin Evening (My Mama's Call).\\"  While I would recommend the complete \\"Classic Period,\\" SITKOL by itself should satisfy the average fan's appetites!

B0007VZ9DK|5.0|If you take Scorcese, DeNiro, Pesci, and give them 3 hours to work with, it's a given they'll deliver a film that's both riveting and memorable.  Casino is such a film.  95% of the film dealt with the birth of (and heydays of) mob-controlled casinos in Las Vegas.  The much more interesting 5% of the film dealt with the downfall of mob control caused mainly by their own excesses - collapsing under a weight of their own making.  But, near the end of the film, DeNiro's character says something that can only be understood fully by someone who lived during that period.  In a way, it was a compliment to the mob-controlled system.<br /><br />Simply put, during the era of mob control, visitors to casinos were treated royally - at best, like kings and queens - at worst, like \\"guests.\\"  Following this era, when corporations took control, visitors to casinos were treated like mere \\"customers\\" - and the ambiance felt by visitors familiar with old Las Vegas hospitality was lost forever.  In short, the mob knew how to treat people.  Rude employees didn't remain employees for very long.  But when the corporations took control, casino visitors became nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet.  And in some cases, employee rudeness was elevated to an art form.<br /><br />Odds have always favored \\"the house.\\"  But if you're going to lose money, it was nicer to lose it to people who took it politely.
0385504225|3.0|I kicked myself after reading The DaVinci Code.  Although the line up of historical facts and ancient secrets lying beneath our contemporary noses and strung into a surprising hypothesis was playfully engaging, the ridiculous thriller rendered in cardboard characters and graceless prose that showcased the facts were hard to take.  I had sworn I would not spend time on another one, but the facts The Lost Symbol promised to knit into more historical revelations, about Washington, DC no less, were irresistible, so I signed on and read it.   Am I sorry? Not quite as sorry as I thought I would be, but can't say anything has changed.    The facts that Brown plays with surround the history of the Masons in Washington, DC.  Much secrecy is associated with the Masonic order by design and thus there are a lot of misconceptions out there.  Brown gets in a lot of clarifications about the Masons and their mission, as well as basic information about the science of symbols and a new, out-there field called Noetics.  Of Noetics, I left the book knowing less than what was introduced at the beginning, especially how it relates to the other arcane knowledge that is presented.  That fuzziness is probably induced by the endless, maddening chase scenes through DC at night, and the equally maddening lack of character development or any resemblance of reality.  Readers of The DaVinci Code will see that formula beaten into the ground here, not to mention a range of stereotypical characters.  The only difference is, The Lost Symbol rips right up to a roaring climax, after which it drops the action entirely and continues on at length about symbols and \\"what the Masons really mean\\" kind of revelations. I'm still not sure what they really mean after reading this.    The book does offer a different kind of tour of Washington, and Brown makes a valid point when his professor hero Robert Langdon addresses a class of Harvard freshmen asking how many have actually visited DC and a few hands go up.Then he asks, how many have been to capital cities in Europe.  All hands go up.  It's time to take another look at DC, but when I do, it won't be with Dan Brown.  We've had our second date which just proved we have no chemistry.

B000H7JD4A|2.0|Plod.  That's what this CD does.  After the upbeat \\"Different World\\"  this CD is all about the \\"Plod\\"  Most every song has a slow 1-2 minute intro, and a slow 1 minute outro.  BORING.  I love Maiden, I started listening to them back in 1980 when a friend showed me the first album.  This album does not match up.  While it is not as bad as the two G-d awful Blaze Maiden albums, it is bad.  It's not close to being on par with Brave New Worls or Dance of Death.  It's just plain boring.  This CD made me sad--I wanted so much more, but I got....this.  One star, for \\"Different World\\", one star because it's Maiden and some of the songs have interesting middle sections.  Sigh--should've been so much more.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This absolutely gut-wrenching movie has a happy ending--but only because it's told backwards!

B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All (1988) is my favorite Metallica album.  This album was the last true raw album that Metallica put out before they started to \\"sell out\\" a bit and became too commercialized beginning with the Black Album (1991).  The music is just plain raw, heavy and fast.  This was the first album that featured then-new bassist Jason Newsted, who was Cliff Burton's replacement.  Jason Newsted's bass lines on this album are at a very low volume, almost to the point where you can't hear it.  The bass also gets drowned out quite a bit by the electric guitars, drums, and vocals.  Jason Newsted himself has said that he wishes he could go back in time to the recording sessions and have his bass guitar turned up at a higher volume.  This is only a small gripe of mine when it comes to this album and doesn't really detract from the album as a whole.  It still is my favorite Metallica album.  The classic early Metallica rawness and attitude are present.  Lead vocalist James Hetfield is at his best, in my opinion.<br /><br />Every song on the album is great.  Personal favorites are One, Blackened, Harvester Of Sorrow, Shortest Straw and Frayed Ends Of Sanity.<br /><br />If you want to get one of the great Metallica albums, get this one.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|Is it The Phantom of the Opera? No. Is it as beautiful? No. Is it the best show I've seen since Phantom? Yes, hands down yes! Preserved, for our listening enjoyment for years to come, is this new compendium of Coney Island. The music is eloquent, and at times, more Beautiful than anything that I've heard in years. Highlights are as follows; The coney Island Waltz, Only for Him, Till I Hear You Sing, Giry Confronts the Phantom, Beneath a Moonless Sky, The Beauty Underneath, Devil Take the Hindmost(First Part & Quartet), Love Never Dies. I do realise that many people will say \\"It's not Phantom\\". No, it isn't, But it's a fitting follow-up.
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis: Bold As Love (1967) is the follow-up to the hugely successful Are You Experienced? (1967).  This album was released in 1967 in England but was not released in the U.S. until 1968.  This album contains a lot of classic Hendrix Experience tunes.  Songs such as Spanish Castle Magic, Wait Until Tomorrow, Little Wing, If 6 Was 9, Little Miss Lover, and the title track are essential Hendrix classics to listen to forever.<br /><br />The Jimi Hendrix Experience made only three albums, but their impact on rock music in the 1960s and beyond is undeniable.  Hendrix, in my opinion, is the greatest guitarist of all time.  He wasn't the greatest singer, but his guitar playing kind of makes up for it.<br /><br />If you wanna rock Hendrix style, then this second offering from The Jimi Hendrix Experience is highly recommended.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|These are good quality dvds that really grab your attention. We were hooked to them so much it became all we could think about everyday. We went through three seasons in like two weeks. We have high standards in our lives because we are Christians so we just didn't feel right about watching any more for a couple of reasons. They have a lot of bar scenes and women for sale, if you know what I mean. The men wear long hair and there is a lot of physical contact between people who are not married. We are strong in our faith and the movies are filled with indian religion that we don't believe in and having it influence our thoughts was just something we got convicted about. But, this was a great seller and the dvds came on time and they are good quality.
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary Of A Madman (1981) was a tremendous follow-up to Ozzy Osbourne's debut solo album Blizzard Of Ozz (1981).  It contains eight great songs.  Classics such as Over The Mountain, Flying High Again, You Can't Kill Rock And Roll and the title track have stood the test of time.  From his days with Black Sabbath, to his solo career and up to the present day, Ozzy truly is the Prince Of Darkness and this album is a reflection of that.  It rocks hard in a lot of places, yet softens up in other places while still maintaining its dark and gloomy feel.  The songs are of high quality and very well put together.  The lyrics are dark and evil as one would come to expect from Ozzy.  This original recording is the way to go.  The product I'm reviewing was released in 1995 (a re-release of the original recording, only it sounds better because it was re-mastered).<br /><br />A word of warning:  DO NOT buy the 2002 \\"remastered\\" version of this album!  Why?  It's because it's not the original recording!  Instead, the bass contributions by Bob Daisley and the drum contributions by Lee Kerslake were re-recorded by other musicians in order for Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne to avoid paying these two uncredited former band members royalties.  These re-recorded songs are not as good as the originals, not to mention the fact that it's a slap in the face to Randy Rhoads, who died in 1982 in a plane crash.  Diary Of A Madman was his last album.  Greed is the motivating factor here.<br /><br />If you like Ozzy Osbourne's solo career, then this is the definitive album.  You'll want to buy this one.  That is, the ORIGINAL recording.  THIS album.  NOT the 2002 so-called \\"re-mastered\\" version.  The 2002 album at first didn't even have a sticker on the package that says that it's not the original recording.  Be careful about what you buy.
B002HWBS96|5.0|If you think you must have opulent settings and fantastic silver tuxes and sumptuous evening gowns to enjoy Rosenkavalier, you're just like me.  I never did figure out how they worked those mirrors in the sets. Yet the production was outstanding in many respects, despite some things I initially didn't care for.<br /><br />For starters, the clothes were modernized and I thought they looked dowdy especially in the presentation of the rose. Octavian had a hairdo that emphasized her big ears, and she didn't look as feminine as I thought she could. Ochs had a less powerful voice than the old guy who's been singing that role for decades.<br /><br />During my second viewing I noticed Octavian was outstanding in her acting, during the plotting of the revenge scene, and her facial reactions to the libretto were superior to most. I decided this excused her ears- she was a \\"man,\\" after all. At live opera I like sitting down front so I don't have to bring binoculars along, so close I can see the spit fly. That's why DVDs are so satisfying. I'm up close when it is better, and have a wide shot when that's better.<br /><br />That, and the music. I thought both the recording and the performance were superb.<br />Fleming is Fleming and she didn't disappoint here, either. Initially I was confused about those lesbians rolling around in the bed, in the first act, but I figured Mr Strauss thought two women singing his music would sound more harmonious with a soprano and a mezzo than a soprano and a tenor. By putting pants on the skinny girl and pulling her hair in a back-do, you should really not notice her ears, as a man, as the plot develops. I got over them too.<br /><br />Despite the deficiencies I refer to here, this DVD is far superior to at least two CD recordings that have been around for years and with this production you get to see as well as hear. The music is magnificent.

B00328G4V6|5.0|I've been listening to Jimi for 42 years.  I saw him live in NYC as a \\"Band Of Gypsys\\". It is amazing that this material was never released.  If you are a fan, you need to listen to this.  I saw Eric Clapton live a few nights ago. It's obvious that Eric's inspiration did not only come from Robert Johnson; but the true Guitar God, Jimi Hendrix. I hope there are more of these quality studio recordings in hiding!
B002S0OBN2|2.0|I am a huge fan of the original and I think that that ruined this for me. I've read the other reviews and don't get the whole 'love it' thing. I didn't like the story and I don't think it went with the original very well at all. Except that Eric loves Christine. And I don't think that some of  songs were very good either. Mr Weber is usually much better at what he does. Bathing Beauties??? really?? I think he should have made the better songs a little longer and cut out the songs that stink.

B002QW5474|4.0|The movie -- I first saw Gremlins when I was a teenager, and I was drawn to the anarchic, irreverent, dark humor of the film. Seeing it decades later as an adult has rubbed off some of its luster -- the pacing is odd at times, and the synthesizer soundtrack is dated. Some of the special effects look clunky, such as the puppets used in some of the long shots. (But I prefer them to today's CGI effects, which look cold and sterile.) I still think it's an entertaining movie, though.<br /><br />Image Quality of the Blu-ray -- This Blu-ray disc is the best I've seen this film look on home video. However, don't get your hopes up. This movie was a low budget affair shot on film stock with grain the size of golf balls. It's never going to look as clean as today's slick, plastic movies, even remastered in High Definition.<br /><br />The Extras -- Extras are plentiful. There's two commentaries by the director Joe Dante and crew, outtakes and deleted scenes, and a TV special that aired back in the 80's to promote the feature.<br /><br />Gremlins has a reputation as a film for children, probably because of Speilberg's involvement, and the cute Gizmo character. However, this movie, along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, was controversial because its use of violence was too intense for a PG rated film. The PG-13 rating was created because of this. It would benefit parents to consider that if they're thinking of buying this video for their kids.
0307463745|4.0|These boys do things differently and eschew standard business practices. It works for them and it probably can work for others (but not for every business). The 90 short chapters struck me as similar in style and tone to the 81 gems of the Tao Te Ching. But like the pull of the Ying and the Yang, there are some contradictions in Rework. For example, they tell us that immediately starting work on a new great idea is a 'bad move'. Yet the final chapter tells us that 'if you want to do something, you got to do it now.\\" Workaholism is for chumps, they say, and you should never work past 5:00. But \\"if you're inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project.\\" They tell us not to raise money, but they rose money from Mr. Bezos himself.<br /><br />That said, this is a must read for any business owner. I own a web business and run it much like the writers of this book. Can't remember the last time I had a standard business meeting with an agenda and a powerpoint, and my employees are spread across the globe. I reply myself to customer service issues quickly and naturally, and I keep my product simple. I don't pay for advertising but instead use word of mouth and attention from the media. But this doesn't apply to all types of companies.<br /><br />It works for small companies who use the power of the internet to maximize automation and who therefore have the LUXURY to eschew the way everyone else does it. But this IS the future of much of the way we will be doing business, and that's why this book is so useful and important. Lao Tzu would be proud.
0743455967|4.0|Review by Richard L. Weaver II, PhD.    Stephen King's On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft is about writing, his approach to it, and his advice to writers at all levels. It is not a boring, how-to manual. You get King's advice, taboos of writing, common tools, elements of grammar and style, and his understanding of the paragraph as the basic element of fiction. His essential advice, which I preach in my talks about writing to fourth and fifth graders: \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.\\" King calls reading the creative center of a writer's life. I was especially interested in King's book because he is a former English teacher, and I expected a unique perspective on the craft of writing, and through his pet peeves, insecurities, horrific experiences, and growth and maturity as a writer, I got exactly what I was looking for. I have read none of King's fiction, although my son is a fan, but I looked at this book as an opportunity to read his thoughts on writing and to get a glimpse of how he works. The book is full of good, simple, well-experienced insights (and suggestions) that will help all writers convey meaning.[[ASIN:0743455967 On Writing]]
B00280LYIC|2.0|Harry Potter is so well-written that adults enjoy it as much as kids. I don't have kids and don't normally read kid fiction, but I love HP so much, and so many people seem to love this book, I thought I'd give it a shot. If you're like me -- a grown up thinking this might be an American HP -- don't bother. The writing was so simplistic it was distracting. I don't expect sophisticated sentence structure in a kid's book but this was really playing to the lowest common denominator. Plus, the author really doesn't draw the reader into what's going on inside Percy. He goes through trauma after trauma with nary a paragraph given to his subsequent emotions (as evidenced by his playing pinochle after an extremely traumatic event). I got to about a quarter of the book on my Kindle and gave up. I was bored and couldn't have cared less about any of these thin characters. Riordan may be popular, but he ain't no Rowling.<br /><br />A note on Kindle formatting: I didn't find any errors, formatting was very professional and there were even little lightning bolts at the beginning of chapters.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Rat movies are always seem to make good storytelling; having previously purchased Flushed Away and Despereaux, I did not know what to expect from this one, since they are all very different plotlines.

B002VECM4A|5.0|As a middle class white dude, Precious is the last sort of movie I ever thought I'd want to watch, much less rave about. But for some reason, even before all the Oscar season hype, it caught my attention. Having missed it in theaters on account of nobody wanting to go with me, I blindly bought the DVD and was extremely impressed with the actors' performances and the handling of subject matters related to sex, incest, HIV, poverty, and abuse.<br /><br />Several other reviews have outlined the plot pretty thoroughly so I won't rehash it all here, but I will emphasize that Precious is not so much a linear story, with a clear cut beginning and end, as it is just a glimpse into the life of a young girl who is coming to realize she wants (and deserves) something more. I cannot praise Gabourey Sidibe enough for taking on such a gritty role with virtually no professional experience, and of course Mo'Nique is wonderful, if not horrifying, as well. Very powerful performances from both women. Even Mariah Carey, who I absolutely detest as a singer, was not only competent, but likeable in this film, as was the underrated Paula Patton. Every facial expression and every bodily movement was meaningful, yet came out naturally. I haven't seen a movie this well cast in a long time.<br /><br />I guess I can't really add anything that hasn't been mentioned many times over already, but I just wanted to throw out one more 5 star review because I think it was an all around well-made movie, and even though I personally can't relate to any aspects of it in my own life on any level, I found myself somehow connected to the characters and emotionally touched. You really can tell that the actors and production crew submerged themselves completely in this story and it draws the viewer in. Plus I think it's totally ridiculous how some people give it one star reviews just for the fact that it's depressing, which is true, but subject matter has no bearing on cinematography.<br /><br />DVD extras are pretty standard, though I would have liked to have heard more from Gabby since she seems like an awesome and grounded young lady in real life. All the best to her.I would have liked to have heard more from Gabby since she seems like an awesome and grounded young lady in real life. All the best to her.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I happened to see some Joe Bonamassa video on YouTube and knew I had to have this DVD. A very strong performer with such immaculate skill. Joe's voice fits the songs very well, complimenting his guitaring skills. The variety of songs is just perfect. Turn up the volume and enjoy every song.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|I must start this review by stating that I generally find Michael Moore's films to be quite entertaining. I don't know how many people he has capturing this footage, but it's uncanny how he is able to bring such raw emotion to bear, telling a story that, on the surface is quite compelling. But while Mr. Moore's movies tend to be entertaining, they prove but one certainty: This man knows much more about making movies than he does about basic economics.     Capitalism begins with a look at the effects of the housing crisis. Mr. Moore shows clips of families being tossed, violently in some cases, from their homes, but what he fails to mention is why. Yes, it's terribly sad to watch someone lose everything, but a little back story would be nice. Is it implausible that these people were acting negligent? Really, must we assume that that they were ALL doing everything right? Mr. Moore, you used to act like you thought I was intelligent.     Part of how Mr. Moore attempts to evoke anger in the viewer is when he visits Miami, Florida, and the firm \\"Condo Vultures.\\" The owner is essentially picking up the pieces of the Miami housing market, looking for condos at rock-bottom prices. The lack of narrative is, I guess, a reflection the director's view that we should all see this guy as some sort of criminal. But what Mr. Moore fails to understand is that the Condo Vultures are doing an absolutely essential task -they are PRICING TOXIC ASSETS. Without a price (even a low one), these things will remain vacant and unkept forever. The government, try as they may, cannot simply wave a wand and fix this problem. Even in a socialist society, there would be prices assigned to condos. Know a high-powered politician? You get the condo by the beach. Are you a family of peasants? You're in the slums. No matter what you do or how hard you work, your class is your class and there's virtually no way to change that. At least in this society, people like Michelle Obama can work hard and controltheir own destiny. People will always desire, you cannot remove that characteristic, but in a society based on \\"fair\\" distribution, prices are reflected in the amount of time one must wait in line to get bread, or the lengths one must go to get close to a powerful head of state, not the amount of studying one is welling to do, or the rigor in which one is willing to save.     One disturbing part of this documentary is the part where Mr. Moore visits a former Wal-Mart employee whose wife died suddenly from an asthma attack. Now, please to not mistake this critique for a lack of sympathy, because it is not, and I feel horrible for their loss. But had Mr. Moore even taken a second to think this simple concept through, he would have realized that it is complete nonsense.  To understand why, must first understand why life insurance exists: to protect survivors in the case of unexpected loss of a financial contributor. When you purchase life insurance, you are paying MORE than the cost of the actual risk associated with death. Suppose an actuary finds that 1:1000 people dies every year. So to get a $1000 life insurance policy may cost the policy holder $2/year. When that 1 person dies, the insurance company just collected $2000 from every 1000 people they insure and will wind up with $1000 profit and pay out $1000. So when applied to the Wal-Mart case, it's impossible that Wal-Mart made a profit as the movie states, because the more people they take out life insurance policies on, the more money they are giving to the insurance company. In our little insurance example, insuring 1000 employees would cost $2000, and return $1000 to the policy holder of the 1 employee that died. If Wal-Mart insured every employee, it would cost them a huge sum of money! And suppose Wal-Mart was actually making money (in the aggregate) insuring their employees. Do you really think that any sane insurance company would let this go on for long? Now way! Insurance companies want to make a profit too, and they are under no legal obligation to insure anybody.    Mr. Moore's critique of the situation in the airline industry is particularly troubling, and shows his very limited understanding of the very simple concept of supply and demand. He makes the argument that pilots, for no other reason than the fact that he doesn't want them \\"counting change in the cockpit,\\" should make more money. But to understand this, one must ask themselves why they make so little in the first place? It seems like a relatively challenging job, one which forces a person to spend vast amounts of time away from their families. Moore's answer: pilots fly because they love to, no matter the cost (meaning opportunity cost, or the cost of not doing a job that makes more money like, as he stated in the film, working as a manager at a fast-food restaurant). Well, unfortunately there are a lot of jobs that people love to do, but if the economy has no need for them, then they must look for other work. If pilots are only making $19,000/year, then maybe the economy is telling future pilots (like the young man from the film that wants to grow up and become a pilot) to look for other lines of work. Get a plane, fly it in your spare time, but do it for leisure because we need more ______s! Even if we were to live in Moore's utopia, there would still be too many pilots, but there, the pilots that did it for the love of it (better know as those making $19,000/year) wouldn't even be able to have the job they so desired. This society would assign jobs to people, and if you wanted to be a pilot (or a moviemaker) and didn't get lucky or have an \\"in\\" in government, tough, you're the trashman, and you don't even get the proper compensation which is afforded trashmen (or women) in capitalism.     The great irony of this flop is the paradoxical thinking exhibited by Mr. Moore. On one hand, he chastises politicians for acting like humans have always and will always act, but on the other he advocates bestowing more power in them. At least Karl Marx's argument hinged on the phony notion that a new \\"socialist man\\" would rise, inspired by the new socialist society. Mr. Moore doesn't pay credence to the fact that a bigger bureaucracy means bigger corruption and more of the same problems. If his desire was merely to expose the fact that politicians are in bed with corporations, he succeeded, but if he wanted any sane person to think that a heavier hand of state was the answer, his attempt was abysmal.     History has proven time and time again that socialism is a failed experiment. Capitalism may mean uneven prosperity, but socialism ultimately means shared destitution. The apple of socialism will always hang low provided people like Mr. Moore are able to make it sound so sweet, but one need look no further than Hitler's German, Stalin's Russia, or more recently, Chavez's Venezuela to see that socialism merely causes the problems that it promises to solve.      Mr. Moore ends this documentary with a call-to-arms to all of the socialists watching. And in a way, he's right; we should stand up for the people. Now is the time that we should look to government to get out of the way and allow capitalism to work its magic and continue doing what it has done for humanity thus far -bring people out of poverty.

Have told many of my friends about this book. It's perfect for those of us who feel overwhelmed by the amount of \\"stuff\\" that comes into the house and makes itself at home all over the counters, floor, desk... while we are still digging out from the last influx. The suggestions in the book are contagious and they work! Even over the long run! You can't help but want to share the wisdom!<br />  I now own the book. This way the library copy will be available for the next person who comes along. Then, after perusing the pages, they can purchase this book as smoothly as I did and be just as satisfied.

0812973992|5.0|Let the Great World Spin is a beautifully written collection of interlocking stories about people whose lives were touched one way or another by an amazing event -- Felippe Petit's famed 1974 tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center.  Halfway through the book, the idea occurred to me that the theme of each story could be described in one word.  So here goes:    The Irish monk, Corrigan -- temptation  Claire, who lost a son in the Vietnam war -- grief  The passenger in a hit and run incident -- guilt  The tightrope walker -- determination  The photographer of graffiti tags -- wonder  The computer hackers -- adventure  Tillie, mother of a prostitute -- remorse  Soderberg, the judge who tries the tightrope walker's case -- resignation  Gloria, who has lost three sons in the Vietnam war -- valor  The woman who lost Corrigan -- love  Jaslyn, who lost her mother many years before -- obligation    Sometimes the stories are in first person narrative, other times in third.  Either way, each voice is unique and authentic, different than the others.  This book is a wonderful read.  I highly recommend it.    Joe

B00328G4V6|4.0|Well here we have another Jimi Hendrix album of unreleased material from later in his career. This is literally what?The fifth,sixth time this has happened following his death? Yet at the same time there's a big difference between discussing the music on this album and merely having an opinion on it. This album comes from a very awkward period in Jimi's sadly short musical career. Most of these songs feature Noel Redding but here you also see the transition to Billy Cox (the liner notes explain what happened during that time) and interestingly enough,as the bassists change you also notice a difference in in the way Hendrix's rhythmic patterns work. By the way the versions of \\"Stone Free\\" and \\"Fire\\" here are not the heavily psychedelic versions as presented previously but rather very different,more concetrated versions of the song that have a more live in the studio type of flavor to them. In speaking of Hendrix's music Miles Davis often referred to what he called \\"hillbilly/country music\\" influences in the sound Jimi had when he was with the Experience and on the album closer you can definately here that country-blues style of playing in the bridge. Now if this album had come out in it's day it would've been the Experience's follow up to [[ASIN:B000002P5U Electric Ladyland]] and therefore followed a somewhat harder groove centered sound on \\"Bleeding Heart\\",\\"Mr.Bad Luck\\" and a great and largely instrumental take on \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" and these also make another point for the album. Aside from the very radio friendly title song none of the songs on this album really focus as much on songwriting as the development of Hendrix's guitar work and his rhythm section. So there's more musically said here than in the composition necessarily.  So if you like Jimi's music as I do and want to hear some things you never heard from him before,this is a good place to go to get it. If you are just getting into him this would'nt be the place to start either. It is,as with any pothumous Hendrix volume designed for the fan and serious collector and that should be taken duely into note before you buy this.her.

It is the oldest and smallest of all of the books I brought home, reminding me that this is a classic for a reason!  They liked the small size, because they both hold their books facing outward, the way I do when I read to them.

B00337KM2S|3.0|Jason Reitman directs his third dramedy of contemporary social mores with \\"Up in the Air\\", based on the novel of the same name by Walter Kirn. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) flies around the country firing people for a living. He works for an Omaha-based company that is paid by other companies to fire their employees, a business that's booming in the recession. But ambitious young Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) proposes to save the company money and keep the terminators home by creating a system to fire people remotely, via a video link. Ryan balks, and his boss (Jason Bateman) sends him on the road with Natalie so that she might benefit from his experience, which also gives him a chance to hook up with Alex (Vera Farmiga), a fellow vagabond and itinerant lover.<br /><br />In spite of the security measures, oxygen deprivation, bad food, and cramped seating, this guy loves airports and air travel. The airport scenes are the most memorable and will probably be looked upon by future generations of filmgoers as representative of the times. That is where \\"Up in the Air\\" is most successful. It smoothly represents an angst peculiar to early 21st-century careerists who criss-cross the country to climb the corporate ladder. It also taps into one of the grim realities of the current economic crisis: high unemployment. George Clooney is charming. It mercifully avoids traditional romantic comedy territory. It wraps up neatly. \\"Up in the Air\\" is well-constructed light entertainment that stops short of being appealing.<br /><br />As suave and manipulative as Ryan is, he makes a living by lying to people. Natalie is alternately callous and childish. At some point it occurred to me that all three business travelers are dishonest, hypocritical, and distasteful. It was about the time the film turned preachy, not about the characters' lack of scruple but about Ryan's loner lifestyle, which is trivial. And it is the only thing about Ryan that is appealing. Why would a movie preach against the very thing that keeps us watching? We have a timely milieu, some sharp dialogue, and a trio of distasteful characters in a movie whose message is \\"everybody needs somebody\\". It's trite. What begins as an edgy dramedy ends up screaming: \\"I conform!\\" It's fun to watch Ryan and Alex one-up each other in one-liners and bedroom antics, but -yikes!- what an insidious, sheepish denouement.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2010): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a teaser trailer (2 min), and theatrical trailer (2 ½ min), an audio commentary, and one featurette. \\"Shadowplay: Before the Story\\" (2 ½ min) is a brief interview with the artists of Shadowplay, a boutique studio that did the opening credits. The audio commentary by director Jason Reitman, cinematographer Eric Steelberg, and First Assistant Director Jason Blumenfeld is constant and informative. Reitman does most of the talking. They discuss the firing scenes, sets, lighting, changes from the book, filming challenges, and other technical stuff. Subtitles are available for the film English, French, Spanish.

B00197YZ7M|5.0|Love that Green GMC Pickup!    Boy! You better be careful what you put on facebook! In a moment of late night reverie, I happened to make the following on-line comment before signing off: Just finished watching 'The Bridges of Madison County' for like the 9th time in three weeks. I love that film!     A Friend had responded the next morning by asking `Why?' It's not like she threw the gauntlet down or anything. I didn't view it as a challenge to my tastes. Nor did she remind me that the Film had been out quite a few years now (released 1995) and had gotten mixed reviews even then. I made the brief comment in return that her question deserved a well-considered answer.    Why is a very good Question. If you'll pardon such a simple list, here's what immediately comes to mind:  * TBoMC is basically an intriguing story about two people who I find interesting on several levels. They each have an assortment of likeable characteristics and curious foibles as do we all. Yet they seem to be genuinely good people.  * That Robert is middle-aged and Francesca is probably somewhere near her early 40s speaks to me, as do their revealed life experiences.  * I don't believe this to simply be a lustful encounter. That they misbehave is a given. But there are times I don't think we can reasonably be expected to control matters of the heart and with whom we fall in love. They succumbed to time, circumstance and temptation.   * The story is told with a minimum of clutter and yet it's allowed to develop slowly and carefully. It has a rhythm and pacing I've come to appreciate.   * The minimal associative story lines support and enhance the main themes and reinforce the fact that of poor choice come consequences. We are reminded that such tangential outcomes may very well involve family and friends.  * Francesca ultimately chooses the higher calling and remains with her husband and children. I didn't expect this and found her decision honorable and to be preferred, if not completely satisfying on a certain visceral and emotional level.  * Duty and Familial Love were reinforced and affirmed.  * And yet it's made obvious to us that both principals did really love each other and thought about each other often until their dying day.  * The dispersal of Francesca's ashes at Roseman Bridge is so poignant.  * Eastwood as the Director found it unnecessary to include an excess of foul language or nudity. The story was revealed to us tastefully - even artistically.  * The Film is beautifully photographed.  * Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood are superb in these roles! We've know for some time that Meryl is such a fine actress but that Clint more than holds his own in such a roll cast against expected type delights me to no end. No guns, fisticuffs, orangutans or serapes here!  * Tissues were required the first few viewings! This is a pretty good indicator that I resonated with the Film on an emotional level.  * I love a good Romance. What else can I say?    I think this Film is truly deserving of Five Stars.    Russell de Ville  11 March 2010
B0002XMF5S|5.0|From start to finish this effort delivers the goods and then some!   Although many fans during this period figured the real Black Sabbath was pretty much done/I guess again!    In For The Kill - Drives right @ you with ultimate fury & power/great intro. rocker/though not sure if it was ever played live during Sabbath's  7th Star tour? If it was actually never played live, it should of been a main staple in the set/great heavy/fast rocker!    No Stranger To Love - A more serious/slight departure from well-known Black Sab. style song elements/war/drugs/paranoia/etc...Great vocals on the recording by Glenn Hughes who unfortunately had to turn in   his mike duties due to vocal problems on tour to Ray Gillen. Also, awesome guitar/moving solos offered by Tony Iommi on this track!    Turn To Stone - Fast, furious, a Clash of The Titans rocker/was done   live and kicks major ass!    Sphinx(The Guardian) - Another short, but fantastic Sabbath soundscape from Geoff Nichols here! Ranks up there with E5150 (Mob Rules), Stonehenge & The Dark (both from Born Again). Also, the keys heard on this one INMOP./slightly resemble a bit of Whitesnake's intro. for Slow An Easy and The Gambler from Slide It In (1983-84).  Lastly, nice intro./used live/going into the Title track.    Seventh Star - Excellent/slower/mid-tempo rocker here! Nicely paced and definitely delivers a consistent driving rhythm!    Danger Zone - Another driving force 10 rocker by Iommi & co, that nevers stops rocking from beginning to the end!    Heart Like A Wheel - Absolutely, one of my favorites! A rock 'n' basic/heavy blues track right in your face! Love the rise of the blues....gaining sound/then pounding the ground all the way to the edge big time!(You say you don't love me, you say you don't care,   but don't leave me standing there!)    Angry Heart - Another cool rocker/shorter, slower paced track that stays firm and keeps the drive going.    In Memory... - A descent ballad/rock track that delivers a short & decisive ending for this LP!    Seventh Star also had some brief chart success on the Billboard's fifty I believe! Back in 1986, I remember seeing it listed and good ole Jim McMahon/Chicago Bear star superbowl winning QB. was one the front cover that particular spring issue.     Overall, SEVENTH STAR's continuing fury of the Sab. legacy speaks for itself! A great album that I recommend for all rock fans especially to those who truly appreciate Black Sabbath's history with or without Ozzy or RJD. Tony Iommi (guitar icon/the riff master), Glenn Hughes (vocals), Eric Singer (now KISS drummer), Dave \\"The Beast\\" Spitz (Bass), & Geoff Nichols Keys)all did a great job on this one! A definite 5 or should I say 7 star album in my book! Check it out/it's well worth getting!

B002OLV3CW|5.0|When i first heard that this band was re releasing their album homesick i thought it was just going to be a regular cd with a new slipcase and a couple extra songs and a dvd with a live set and like 20 minutes worth of extra footage, and me being a huge fan of this band I was looking forward to what they were going to do, then later on i found out that the two bonus tracks are just acoustic versions of two songs on the regular cd, it brought my hopes down a little bit, but then i saw the contents of the cd/dvd and i was surprised. I went to the mall the day it came out and bought it. Wow! this is really worth the buy let me tell you why.    The only downside is that the two bonus songs are just acoustic versions of two of the songs on the cd, but it comes in beautiful packaging some of the best i have seen and the booklet is also incredible, but what makes this worth the money is defiantly the bonus dvd, it has more than three hours worth of features and live shows and a few surprises.   it has the live in Switzerland which is pretty awesome, but it also contains a documentary called \\"The Homesick\\" a documentary about the band being on warped tour and it is very interesting and funny at the same time, then it has a few music videos and all five episodes of the homesick sessions which are hilarious.     A day to remember really knows how to please their fans, i suggest you buy this version of homesick because it is the best one to own!

0061689246|5.0|This book had many differences from the movie that I saw a few years ago, which allows me to appreciate both the book and the movie as two distinct works. I found the plotline of the book to be much more subdued in comparison to the movie. The love between the star and Tristan was not nearly as passionate, nor Victoria Forester quite so much of a snob. The ghosts of the Stormhold brothers were not as animated as in the movie, and Captain Johannes Alberic of the sky-ship Perdita was definitely not a flamboyant cross-dresser. While all of this may sound very critical, I still enjoyed the book for what it did offer. More explanation for the \\"wall\\" in Wall is given and Tristan's mother Una has more character development. Ditchwater Sal is given more attention, as well as more characters introduced into the story. The three witches that are after the star's heart are less representative of the \\"Big Bad\\" and more in line with the quirkiness of Faerie. Even the ending of the book differs dramatically with the movie, but I still like both endings - the movie for its drama, the book for its peacefulness.

0689865384|3.0|The style of writing reminded me a bit of the Twilight saga, fast-paced, with lots of teenager-style lingo mixed in. I loved all the the little details that created the world of \\"post-Rusties,\\" such as the groups of people - Uglies; New, Middle, and Late Pretties; Special Circumstances; Smokies and New Smokies - as well as the shortened version of names - Tally, Ellie, Sol, Croy, Shay, Peris, Astrix, etc. The way that our world is portrayed in comparison to the world in the book is also interesting in various details such as telling the difference between roller coasters and railroads, Tally's reactions to eating meat and making clothing from animal skins, David still referring to his parents as \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\", and Tally finding David's name odd. The reader sees the negative aspect of the way we presently live, as well as the positive and negative aspects to living  in the extreme opposite of \\"Rusty\\". It seems that neither extreme is the answer, but rather finding the \\"happy medium,\\" which is rarely ever easy. This post-apocalyptic world fits right in with works such as 1984, Anthem, and Brave New World. I look forward to continuing the series with the next book, Pretties.

I would have loved to hear more guest singers on here , than the same that they did 2 times over. I really  did not like the art work for the inside of the cd, or the booklet...how cheep, love the cover work , but what happened to the rest. fans who pay good money should get the words to all the songs and better booklet. This cd is not gonna break any sale records, but maybe a stepping stone to something even greater . would I buy it, hell yes, after many plays of this cd, got to give it 5 STARS, its great, I have learned to love all the tracks, my hats off to you guys, THIS IS A GREAT CD, BUY IT, I LOVE IT.

Visually the movies is fine, good sfx, good designs and over all atmosphere, the costumes looked good except for Cobra Commander's mask that truly looks stupid and the joe's armor suits that looks to bulky and complicated, something more in the Iron Man line would have been better. The acting is , well, good enough for the material. The only bad part was the whole Paris chase secuence, is far too long and the good guys end up doing more damage than the bad ones. That said is pretty much what i expected but better. As far as comic, toy and superhero movies go this one is a winner, and compared to Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen, this one is a work of art.

I especially like the two main characters, Neal and Peter, thief and Gman respectively, working together to solve white collar crime.  It is impossible not to grow to love this duo. They are just so good together.  This may be because they are both such romantics.  Both of them are deeply in love with their wives but Neal's has left him whereas Peter's is rock steady. Neal's henchman, a con artist from his former life, is deeply comic.  He refers to Peter as the suit and Peter's wife as Mrs. Suit. But he is also lovable.  Is this a great crime show which guys will love?  Being a woman, I have no way of answering that but I have my doubts about whether men will go for this series.  For women it is a weekly guilty pleasure.  Just to show you how drawn in you can get, initially I considered only Neal cute.  Now I consider Peter just as cute. Ladies, grab that remote and put this on your weekly schedule!

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Having followed these two authors throughout the past five years with Ruby on Rails and 37signals rapid growth I got wind of this book. At first I thought it would be just another book that gave \\"perls of wisdom\\", had little direction, made you feel good but in the end gave no value. However, I am pleased to report that I feel just the opposite. I sat down to read this on my kindle last night for an hour and ended up reading the whole thing.    If you have ever had a great idea and felt a little voice telling you that maybe you should start a business then this book is for you. This book is especially powerful if you are someone who is tech savvy, and are thinking about using the power of the internet to grow an idea into a business. Regardless of who you are, I am confident that this book will make you get off your butt and be get something done, when you previously thought you had to jump through hoops.    The best $10 I have spent in years.

B00328G4V6|4.0|\\"Valleys of Neptune\\" is, perhaps, the last of the Jimi Hendrix vault recordings and as such it is notable.  The song \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" while not exactly a \\"lost classic\\" is definitely a \\"lost very good\\" song, it is more in the lyrically experimental vein than a guitar workout but as far as the \\"Dylanesque\\" Hendrix it works very well.  The new version of \\"Stone Free\\" veers more towards the soulful than the original version and is worth the price of the CD itself.  This being Hendrix there is plenty of great guitar work- kind of goes without saying- and as I looked over the track list before my first listen I asked myself \\"Do I really need another version of 'Red House'?\\"-well, turns out I did as the version here is definitely superior.  As long as you view these recordings as a bookend and not essential there is a lot of good stuff here- the recordings are solid and polished and are not just rough recordings that will appeal only to completists.  All in all- I now have something I thought I would get ever again- new Hendrix recordings and that is just groovy, man.
0061922315|5.0|Kavita and Jasu Merchant live in a poor village in India where they are barely scraping a living. When Kavita gives birth to another daughter, she knows that she must give the baby up for adoption to ensure her survival. With the help of the midwife and her sister, Kavita makes the arduous journey to a Mumbai orphanage. All she has to give the baby is a name, Usha, a small bracelet, and her tears. In the United States, Somer, an American pediatrician, discovers that she cannot have children. Gradually she is persuaded by her husband Krishnan to adopt a baby from India. That baby is Usha, now renamed Asha. As the years go by, their story is told through the eyes of Kavita who has never stopped missing her daughter, Somer who is struggling in her marriage and relationship with her daughter, and Asha who finds a way to bridge the gap between both worlds.      I loved everything about this book. Kavita's story is so touching and sad yet she is a strong and resilient woman, living in a poor village and later the slums of Mumbai. Somer comes from a markedly different world as a well-to-do doctor in California yet it is moving to see her as a new mom trying to bridge the culture gap between herself and her Indian husband. Asha is a caring and special young woman, a blend of both her mothers. I would highly recommend this novel to book clubs and to those who enjoy the novels of Jhumpa Lahiri, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Amy Tan, and Khaled Hosseini. I would also recommend it to anyone who likes to read beautifully written stories about mothers, daughters, and families. Shilpi Somaya Gowda is an author to watch.       Disclaimer: I received an ARC of this book for review purposes.
B00275EGWY|4.0|The Hurt Locker presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. I have a friend that is EOD, and he and I watched this movie, he said that while this movie is a bit of a far cry as to how they really operate, it's still a really entertaining movie. He said military guys know, you can't exactly go rogue too many times, because the hammer of authority will come down upon you. The constant threat of dying, hot and heavy bomb suits, the robots, the tempermental personalities in conflict with one another, strained lives back home, and silly officers who filter into a situation with the idea of taking charge yet have no idea what's going on, now that is entirely true to life. But it makes for a good story. The acting is really quite good and the directing is awesome. For those who like military movies or just action movies, this one is a good.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Shutter Island marks the fourth collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is Scorsese's follow-up to his Best Picture-winning The Departed and is adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, whose novel Mystic River was the basis for the terrific Clint Eastwood film. Shutter Island is a different breed of film from both that film and previous Scorsese films. As a director who has been working since the 1960s, you wouldn't expect him to have anything new to offer as a filmmaker, and you would be wrong. Shutter Island is a psychological horror film with shades of similarities to films like Secret Window and The Game (story-wise; specifically in the conclusion), but it's the way Scorsese handles the material rather than the material itself that makes it as good as it is. Shutter Island has beautiful cinematography, lovely art direction, and a haunting score...It's not the story that stays with you as much as the atmosphere.    DiCaprio (who is in every scene) plays Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels, a U.S. Marshal from Boston circa 1954, who is sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient at Shutter Island's asylum for the criminally insane. With his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) in tow, Teddy is immediately baffled by the woman's disappearance and suspicious of the ominous doctors (Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow) who run the asylum. Haunted by dreams of his dead wife (Michelle Williams) and his time in the war; Teddy slowly unravels the mystery housed at Shutter Island with shocking, albeit semi-predictable results.    I've compared the film to Secret Window and The Game, but this comparison is a reflection of various parts of the plot. As a film, it's much more reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Lars von Trier's Antichrist sans the sexual mutilation. The cinematography led me to specifically recall Antichrist as both films share a similar artful quality and creativity in the area. There are scenes in ShutterIsland that are breathtakingly beautiful, some even capturing that beauty in the grotesque and horrifying. As for the comparison to The Shining, Scorsese has made a film that is so atmospheric, it draws you into both the setting and the mystery of the film in the way The Shining did. To say this film evokes Kubrick is an understatement; it's the closest thing I've seen to a Kubrick film since Kubrick died and I doubt Scorsese would deny that influence.    As you could expect from a Scorsese film, it's filled with terrific actors giving terrific performances but it's DiCaprio who carries the film. DiCaprio is a misunderstood actor, equally loved and hated by moviegoers/critics. Some think he's wooden, incapable of evoking any real emotion while some see him as one of the greatest working actors. This performance should sway some of his naysayers, as DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Teddy. This is a complicated character, with many dimensions to him and DiCaprio embodies those dimensions perfectly with plenty of nuance. The supporting players are all perfectly cast as well, sometimes making quite an impression with only a single scene, such as the terrific Jackie Earle Haley.    Certainly some will find it slow-moving (although at 138 minutes, it never feels long) and even more will see the long-winded ending as a bit of a cop out. I wasn't disappointed by the ending due to the inclusion of the haunting scene at the Lake House and Scorsese leaving his audience with just a little bit of ambiguity. This is a terrific film Scorsese has made here. It's a horror film of the sort that isn't made anymore; an intelligent horror film for intelligent people. It's the first great film of 2010, proof that DiCaprio and Scorsese bring out something special and powerful in each other. Its imagery and memorable musical score only get richer with a second viewing. Don't miss this film.    GRADE: A-

0307463745|5.0|I think this book was GREAT for me because while reading it I had already worked on a company for 3+ years.  I've already made a ton of common mistakes, and when you read a book like this it puts it all in perspective.    This book reminds you to go with your gut instinct.  It helps you realize that you do have the capabilities to make things happen.     Everyday you have things jammed down your ears about what to do, and how to run a business.  For me, a little light-bulb always goes off, telling me, well... that theory just doesn't make sense.  But, for some reason because you hear the same thing over and over (raise money! raise money! raise money!) you tend to forget your original goals, dreams, opinions, and gut instinct.    I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in business strategy, or life strategy for that matter.  Even if you think it's not going to be good, it only takes 2 hours to read - give this book a read!
B000002A3T|5.0|when this LP was new I was living in jackson hole , wyoming & turned on the public radio station out of casper , wyoming late one night to find that the DJ put on this cd ( very day/night of its release ) & played the whole thing from beginning to end ( I think he lost his job for doing that ) well there is no point to my intro & now anyway  it ( division bell ) will go down in history as the very last pink floyd LP. would it be better with roger waters input??  probably yes  but I still think it's fantastic classic pink floyd sound;... great melodic atmospheric pop  with enough crunching guitars & distortion to satisfy everyone or most anyway
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|After four listens I can say this without doubt : Plastic Beach is my favorite Gorillaz album.  It's lush, soulful, kinetic, thoughtful, insightful, spiritual..It's musical meditation.  It reverberates through your mind, moves into your heart, your soul, your body.  It connects us all, because it speaks about overlooked things which are a part of everyone's life.  It's devastating observation.  Although a very social statement, it's not delivered akin to shouting at any one group or casting down blame.  This is the inherent success, because it's not about condescension. It's neutral; one big figure pulling the rug from everyone's collective carpets, which they themselves are sitting upon.  It's this self-realization that is key, it brings to the album a true melancholy.  It's a sadness, a helplessness, a paradox any thoughtful minds will find familiar.  I could write an essay about this album, come up with my own interpretations for the songs within the over-all concept I just pinned down in this lone paragraph..but I would rather listen.  Ad infinitum, gleefully.    For the Special Edition : Get it if you adore the minds behind Gorillaz.  It has an excellent documentary with Damon and group, and features excellent packaging of new artwork from Jamie.  It's gorgeous and a MUST for hardcore gorillaz fans.
B000OT6V00|5.0|Hellboy: 10 out of 10: Hellboy is one of the three best comic book adaptations of the last ten years. Now considering the recent spate of mediocre comic book adaptations (as of 2004) this is a bit like winning a beauty contest at a fat farm. Hellboy is simply head and shoulders above the rest.<br /><br />It is on par with the recent Spiderman movies (Hellboy sports a better hero and better CGI effects while Spiderman takes the nod in the love interest and villains categories) much better than the X-men films and simply puts other comic book adaptations to shame (League of Extraordinary Gentleman should be particularly embarrassed)<br /><br />Hellboy starts with a rip-off of one of the last scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and introduces horrible clich&eacute;d villains such as Nazi babe and Rasputin. Yet the scene works somehow. Director Guillermo del Toro nails a comic book style to the direction that keeps the action and humor going during the most implausible circumstances. Kudos is also in order for the special effects, both make-up (which is spot on) and CGI.<br /><br />In general I dislike CGI effects compared to models but they really do shine here. Many a big-budget Hollywood film has come out recently with horrible special effects that stick out despite 50 million plus budgets. Hellboy's effects are simply seamless where one forgets that entire characters and locations are digitally generated.<br /><br />The acting is also seamless with lead Ron Perlman giving a scene stealing cigar chomping performance that rivals Daniel Day Lewis's turn in Gangs of New York and Jeffrey Tambor turning a stock clich&eacute; (obstructionist bureaucrat who wants to shut everything down) into a humanistic sympathetic character. (This is an example of very smart writing which permeates the film that makes even the clich&eacute;d characters into three-dimensional figures.)<br /><br />Although all is not perfect (In addition to Nazi Chick and Rasputin we also have a Clock/Sand Nazi and a Space Cthulhu as an improbable villains); Hellboy is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be.y is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be.

0385737424|5.0|I originally got this book for my 12-year old daughter, after hearing it recommended on KUOW's Book Reviews by Seattle librarian Nancy Pearl (the subject was Mysteries). Her class was covering the Mystery genre in Language Arts, and as we are both BIG fans of Madeline L'Engle (the main character constantly re-reads \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\"), I thought she might enjoy it. I was a little hesitant, given many of the reviews who didn't like the book... particularly those who said that they never finished it because they found the first half rather confusing. Because the person recommending it was a a young girl, however, I went ahead and bought it.    My daughter really enjoyed the book, and then it turned up on the recommended reading list for her school. She told me that she thought I would enjoy it too, and then kept asking me if I had read the book. I asked her what she thought about the people who said that the book was too confusing, and she said that she could see where people might think that, but that it was worth hanging in to the end. She was right.    It is a sort of \\"coming of age\\" book (for 12-year olds), with \\"big revelations\\" that others may find too pat and easy. But it is a quiet book, for thougthful kids who are trying to navigate their way through the 'tweens. It addresses the frustrations and discomforts of change... of old relationships, and developing new ones... in ways that many kids can relate. Miranda has a falling out with her best friend since pre-school, Sal. In \\"losing\\" him, she learns to forge new relationships with other classmates, and learns that people are not always what you think; that if you scratch a little below your surface impressions, they may surprise you. As she helps her mother prepare for an appearance on \\"The 20,000 Pyramid,\\" she also must solve a puzzle that could save two people's lives.

0440241901|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's for a very long time, but I had never read anything other than her Shopaholic books.  I wasn't sure if I would enjoy a different character as much, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this book.<br /><br />Can You Keep a Secret? has a great premise -- Imagine sitting on a plane full of strangers, violent turbulence hits, and you feel as if your life is coming to an end.  What would you do?  Why, spill all your deep dark secrets to your neighbor, of course!  Emma Corrigan lets it all out and doesn't stop until, surprisingly,the plane lands safe and sound in London.<br /><br />So then it's back to life as normal.  Emma has her two roommates, a loving boyfriend, and a job as a marketing assistant.  But when the owner of the company makes an impromptu and rare visit, Emma's world is turned on its end.  Looks like that handsome stranger on the plane is also her boss -- and he knows every single thing about her.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was a fast read; 100 pages flew by rather quick.  I found myself connecting easily with Emma, and could see us being friends in real life.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly.  It's fun, easy, and full of laughs.

B002VECM4K|5.0|On the cover of the Blu-Ray disc, it shows a heavy, African-American girl walking, and behind her, the hint of a butterfly just starting to come into focus. No image sums up this moving, challenging film better, for as you watch it, you are seeing a person go from larva to stunning butterfly over the course of two hard, painful, and ultimately, joyfilled hours.<br /><br />Precious, based o the novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire, is the story of a forgotten segment of our society, a young, inner-city black girl, living a life of hell. Sexually abused by her father, physically and emotionally abused by her mother, Precious finds the strength to get up from her bed and face her bleak life, mostly by a fiery imagination. When she is discovered to be pregnant for a second time, Precious is expelled from her school and is offered a spot in an alternative school. The teacher at the school, Ms. Rain, does something amazing: she sees Precious. That act alone begins to crack the protective cocoon that Precious has built around herself to survive.<br /><br />Not enough can be said about Gabourey Sidibe, who takes Precious, fully realizes her, and makes her soar. Also equally as stunning is the comedian Mo'Nique, who portrays the mother with such intensity that her performance leaps off the screen and grabs you by the throat. There were scene between these two actresses that literally left me gasping for air, I was holding my breath for so long.<br /><br />As Precious begins to find herself, begins to find who she is, she also discovers her place in life, and her strength. Towards the end of the movie, Precious reflects on this strength, and says, about her teacher:<br /><br />\\"Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before. And in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel, they still be shining for everybody else.\\"<br /><br />Precious could also be talking about herself.<br /><br />Lee Daniels has given us a gift. It's not an easy gift to watch. It's not an easy story to tell. But it's real. As she emerges from her cocoon, we see Precious' face for the first time, with glimmers of hope, glimmers of optimism, glimmers of tomorrow. She is finding her wings, she is learning to fly.<br /><br />Every child in America should have that hope.Lee Daniels has given us a gift. It's not an easy gift to watch.

1559408855|4.0|The film will scare you, shock you and even make you cringe to no limits. The film practically lays emphasis on 'minors breaking rules and then being punished', that's the plot of the film in eight simple words but what gets it more dramatic is when they realize how worse punishments can get. The film is at most times almost hard to watch, but there is decent emphasis on violence, corruption, physical, emotional and sexual abuse portrayed in the film, one can hate it but cannot ignore it.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|There are not many albums I look forward to any more. I can't tell you exactly why this is the case, perhaps I'm just getting older. \\"Plastic Beach\\" however was one of the few albums in recent years that I actually preordered. I own the first two Gorillaz albums-the self-titled and \\"Demon Days\\"-and while not a ravenous, hardcore fan, I generally thought both albums were pretty solid. Each album had songs that I really liked a lot, and a few that while not my taste, I could appreciate for their uniqueness.    I guess you could say that's mostly what I think about this album: I appreciate the uniqueness. It's definitely a well thought out album that is woven well to be a cohesive whole, I'm just not very fond of the whole. I can definitely tell that this is an album that fans of indie rock will eat up, and most likely fans of Damon Albarn and Blur. I can't comment specifically on the last two because I'm not entirely familiar with all of his work, but regardless this is definitely a rock album.    Perhaps this is why I only can appreciate it in part. I grew up on rock music and it will always be my first love, but Gorillaz for me has always been an equal blend of Funk, Hip-Hop, and Rock. This is what made it so great. Every song had a beat that made you want to move, despite the fact that every song exhibited a different theme or emotion. Almost all of these songs to me are mixtures of Ambient, Electronic, and Rock, with only the rapping and a few good basslines on a couple tracks giving it any distinction of Funk or Hip-Hop. I kind of feel like rappers were thrown in there because Albarn knew they had to be or else he could lay no claim to the Gorillaz name, even though he probably would have gladly excluded them. The long list of guest appearances to me seems more like an attempt to be hip, rather than an honest quest to blend styles of music. It's funny, because I would give this album 5 stars for following its theme (the beach), but can only give it 3 for continuing what made Gorillaz, Gorillaz.    I have listened to this album on repeat since it arrived in the mail Monday trying to give it a chance, but I think it will probably hit the shelf for awhile. Stylo and Superfast Jellyfish are my favorites, while everything else is a little too slow and boring for my taste. There are a few other tracks that have glimpses of that Gorillaz sound, but I definitely think Stylo is the closest this album ever gets. I'm definitely in for change and improvement, and who better than an animated band to significantly shake up their own sound, but when it's this far from where it came from, it seems like it should have been put out by another band. Just change the name to anything else but Gorillaz and I'll bump this album up a star.

B0033AX26I|5.0|A lovely CD and FINALLY a recognition by leading Mexican figures that they were NOT ALONE - European and North American dissenters stood shoulder to shoulder with their ancestors.  All we need now is to recognize the German speaking members of the brigada.  A belated, beautiful and timely collection of a Mexican-Irish melodic mélange. Other reviewers have done an excellent job on the melodies.  For a Historical Synopsis:-  the Brigada San Patricio fought for Mexico against American SLAVE state expansion(1846-48) and also for their religious rights. Of the 900 men (some with experience of the Napoleonic wars in Europe, it is estimated that approximately 30% were German speaking). - see the dvd of the 'film' -  'One Man's Hero' - with : Tom Berenger, Joaquim de Almeida,  director: Lance Hool ASIN: 630571889X -   BACKGROUND:-  In Europe Republican governments were replaced by the Napoleonic dictatorship followed by the restored Monarchies (1815).  Post the American war of independence, Article 5 of the Paris treaty (Nov 1782), American democrats had to guarantee the `the rights of confiscated `property' of Loyalist Americans (this included slaves and estates). Although small loyalist farmers lost out, the larger Southern plantations owned by English aristocrats remained. Less than 5% of loyalist left for Europe, Canada or the Caribbean. Little changed from the `Ancienne Regime'  Paddy is wrong in his assertion on the dominating factor.  Slave power continued to be the main economic driving forces in the southern states of the new world.   Within the slave states, non slaveholding whites were barred from important offices and opportunities. With the Missouri line `Dixiland' could only expand west or south.  The Slave States:-    The Mexican constitution's (1824) abolition of slavery, in particular the sale of slaves incensed slave traders. In 1827 President John Adams offered Mexico US$1 Million to buy Tecas, in 1829 President Andrew Jackson tried with an offer of US$5million but was also rejected.   See also `La Constitución de Apatzingán' by Ernesto de la Torre Villar ISBN 9688371777  Along with  delegates Andres Quintana Roo & Carlos Bustamante (1814 - they called for popular sovereignty, republican government, abolition of slavery, equality before the law, representative government, separation of church and state.  Austin and Houston (both of Virginia) were instigators of the Tecas land grab. The addition of Texas to the Union as a SLAVE state, was blocked until the election in 1844 of president Polk.   WHY DID IT HAPPEN THEN:-  After 1815 and the restoration of the European ancienne regimes the 'White Royalist Terror' was unleashed on Republican, Radical Enlightenment, anti monarchic and anti-autocratic church elements. As a  consequence many Europeans came to America seeking refuge as the United Irishmen before them - 'United Irishmen, United States' by David Wilson ISBN:0801431751.  The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) expanded slavery north into Kansas.  In New York slavery was abolished only in 1827 and a re-introduction was attempted again following this act.  Implementation of the `Fugitive Slave act' (1850) along with the need to fix the route of the railways finally provoked the American Civil War     WHY WAS THIS WAR IMPORTANT:-  General Zachariou Taylor (who owned more than 100 slaves in Louisiana & Mississippi) went into Mexico beyond the Neuces river (Corpus Christi).  Lincoln denounced the war in Congress. Thoreau went to jail rather than pay taxes to support it, and Ulysses Grant (who served in Mexico) described it as \\"the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation\\". The Catholic Hierarchy more interested in protecting Anglo interests in the period of the legalisation of the Catholic church in England, sent two priests McEvoy (GaelicSpeaker) and Rein (GermanSpeaker) to stem the flow of support for Mexico.   The war was a prelude as many later took different sides in the North  American CivilWar (1861-65).  Some examples of the correspondence by Grant, Lee, Sherman, Taylor, Scott, Bragg on their personal experiences of the Mexican war prior to the Northern Civil War.   In consolation to the Mexican people, it was Californian gold that allowed Lincoln to subsequently defeat  the combined forces of the slavistocracy and European royalty.  The Northern states at that time were the last refuge of the 'Republic of Letters' and the light of the Enlightenment, perilously close to being extinguished.  One of the etymologies of 'Gringo' in Irish folklore is the fact that many Patricios sang the Napoleonic song 'Green grows the Lilio' as they marched thro' Mexico.  One notable United Irishman, Jemmy Hope, still on the run, was interviewed by R. Madden in the 1840's aged in his 80's. I would like to see a film based on his life.

B00001U0E1|5.0|The winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture for 1998 (awarded in 1999), \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" has gotten some unfair bad press in my opinion, largely due to its beating \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in the contest.  The latter film, a dramatic epic that redefined cinematic depictions of combat, has been widely viewed as the superior product.  As a matter of personal opinion, I prefer \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", though I acknowledge that I am squarely in the middle of the film's target demographic:  English Literature nerds who will get jokes about a violence-loving theatre assistant named John Webster.  Nevertheless, the film is a stirring and witty tribute to Shakespeare and Renaissance theatre.    Set late in the reign of Elizabeth I (Judi Dench, in an eight-minute performance that won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes, brother of Ralph) is a struggling playwright working at the Rose Theatre, owned by Phillip Henslowe, who is deep in the hock.  Shakespeare is a prodigious talent, but romantic disappointment has resulted in a serious case of writer's block.  Henslowe needs the comedy \\"Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter\\" finished soon, and Shakespeare needs inspiration, which comes in the form of Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), and ardent admirer of his plays who poses as a man to audition for a part.  The two fall in love, but she is to marry the Earl of Wessex (Colin Firth; oddly, a year after the film was made, this title was created for Prince Edward; maybe Elizabeth II was a fan?).    This is a very smart and clever film, to start.  Written by acclaimed playwright Tom Stoppard with Marc Norman (who won an Oscar for it), it displays tremendous understanding of the time period, as well as the literature surrounding Shakespeare (choosing, for purposes of comic and dramatic effects to ignore the basis for \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in an Italian story).  You are given a real sense of the nature of the theatre of the period, andall of the competing demands on writers (the greatest writer of the English language was working for pence on a line, as he puts it).  And Shakespeare is not yet the greatest English writer, with a running gag being the constant praise for Christopher Marlowe, who advises Shakespeare on his writing.    Gwyneth Paltrow won an Oscar for this star-making turn, and she is indeed marvellous, providing the soul of the film.  She conveys tremendous passion, both romantic and for the theatre: she's not an especially convincing man, but that is a comic device that Shakespeare knew well.  Joseph Fiennes as the other lead is good; Fiennes is not the most talented actor out there, but he provides the requisite romantic intensity, and is believable as a playwright.  Ben Affleck is hilarious in a minor role as Edward Alleyn, one of the biggest  stars on the Renaissance stage, an egotist tricked into playing a minor role.  Dench is tartly funny, and there are a number of other recognizable faces, including Tom Wilkinson.    One of only two comedies to win Best Picture in the last 30 years, \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is well worth seeing.

B002XTBE6K|4.0|As a devoted Janeite, I think I've seen almost every adaptation of her works ever filmed (and available in the US). I own the Gwyneth Paltrow version and was quite satisfied with it, but I could never watch it with my husband since he admitted it absolutely bored him to tears. I'm no big fan of the Kate Beckinsale version, so I was interested to see this new version starring reputable actors like Garai, Miller, and Gambon. I bought the dvd and just finished watching it with my husband last night, and he and I both agreed that the film is charming. Unlike any version I've seen so far, this series took its time in order to \\"flesh out\\" the character of Emma and let you see her strengths and weaknesses. It began in Emma's infancy and allowed the viewer to see her as a child, a teen, and then as the 21 year old we meet in the novel. At first I found this slow going, but I came to appreciate all the explication as it shed light on the character. Emma's sheltered life due to her father's overprotection was highlighted here whereas it is usually somewhat glossed over or ignored. I was leery of Jonny Lee Miller as Knightly, one of Austen's best leading men, in my opinion. I felt he might lack the physical presence Knightly needed to be the imposing figure he can be at times. But Miller won both me and my husband over as somewhere in the first episode, we looked at each other and said , \\"I like this guy.\\"  He perfectly expressed Knightly's strength, goodness, intelligence, and humor while still seeming entirely human.  As the series draws to a close, we are shown both Knightly and Emma struggling with realizations about their own lives, and the result was realistic and quite lovely. I would recommend this dvd to the Austen collector, period romance fan, or anyone who'd like to see a gorgeously filmed romantic tale with a satisfying ending and rich characterizations.
B0035V35PI|5.0|1. Are you a fan of the ninja mythos? If yes, continue  2. Do you like awesomely executed choreography and to be Entertained? IF yes, go on  3. Are you one of those people that sit back and watch ALL movies looking to be enlightened on the meaning of life and anything that doesn't make you think disgust you? If yes, Stop, you don't belong here. If yes, Continue...    When this movie was being thought up, there was one thing on the mind of the director. \\"How can I bring back the love of ninjas that I had as a young child?\\" His answer was to create this movie and update the premise of the ninja with the many cool things that have been done with the genre since the old days of Sho Kosugi's Revenge of the Ninja. This means, take all of the mythological aspects of the ninja:   Shadow walking (or melding with shadows)  The mind of a Ninja (Classic training Sequences that exist in all Martial Flicks  Wicked Sword play and creative use of weaponry  Agility beyond what normal humans have  Add in a little Ninja Magic and Jutsu  = ENTER NINJA ASSASSIN    As with all great movies and concepts this film excels at one thing in particular, Mixing Genres. Within the first 5 minutes of the story, you will realize that you aren't dealing with a strict action movie. There is a great blend of Horror, Suspense, Comedy, and down right Awesomeness. As with all action movies there are some things that people consider weak with the plot but lets not get ahead of ourselves. If you go into an action movie looking to see Schindlers List, you will be disappointed. This movie was made strictly to entertain. If it does not do that for you, then you have no blood in your veins or you should go see twilight and look at the debauchery of vampire myth and swoon over the skin of a killer. Seeing Sho Kosugi again after all these years is amazing, and to see that he is still just as awesome as he was in the 80s when I was a child is Inspirational. Everyone does their job in the film acting wise, and After months of training and choreography and turning his body into a killing machine, Rain pulls it all together. I have actually read the script for this movie and there are some things that I hope are included with the blu ray. The ideas that are touched on in the film would make great stories in themselves and I for one hope that this implies that the Ninja Renaissance is upon us. Its been too long.     The only thing you get from this movie is visceral action, classic ninja cinema, and a plot that fits the moment.      A lot of people went into this movie thinking that they were going to go see the next Matrix film, as they do with any film that has the Wachowskis banner on it somewhere. This has lead to a lot of films by them and their protege McTiegue being overlooked. The biggest crime being the bad press that Speed Racer Received even though it was one of the best family movies ever. Buy Ninja Assassin and you will not be disappointed.
1594481717|4.0|I have always been a big fan of Emotional Quotient.  This book deals with the shift in the world from a left side of the brain to a right side of the brain.  The author does this with creating a new reality through more of an emotional and intuitive approach.  As some of the simple, yet complex skills are being outsourced to other places in the world, the employee must adapt with creativity.  The people who have the ability to sense and see that which is not yet will be the most valuable workers in the coming generations.  The book deals with the theory but one of the best aspects is the practical section at the end of each skill.  The author provides some helpful resources to follow up with on implementing the talent.  One of the most interesting sections is on how to see empty space.  He will give books to read that will help with reading people and emotions and how to create and craft a story.  The book is well written and a good read.

I've always been a fan since I was a kid in the 60's when my Mom gave me \\"Axis Bold As Love\\" in 1970. In fact I feel a resurgence in Jimi's music with younger people today because of kids like John Mayer and Phillip Sayce.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br />Hear my Train a Comin\\"<br />Loverman<br />Ships Passing through the night<br />Red House<br /><br />Long Live Hendrix!

B000022TSY|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it first came out. I'm an old hippie, so I really enjoyed the crazy memories that this movie evoked. Jack Nickolson is so funny and, of course, Peter Honda and Dennis Hopper are classic! If you want to know what it was really like in the 1960s, this is the movie for you! Warning! There is some bad language. But otherwise a great, classic, and fairly accurate movie about the counterculture and just wanting to be free. Highly recommend this movie. You gotta see it at least once.
0790731452|4.0|I have to admit this movie wasn't my favorite years ago when it first came out in theaters. I think this movie is actually really good. Tim Burton's movies have always been my favorite type of movies, except for this one till now. Now, I actually appreciate what this movie was trying to potray- very campy and/or different which very common for Burton's films. That is why I love them so much.    This movie includes an all star cast including Danny Devito, Glenn Close, Jack Nicholson, Annette Benning, and Sarah Jessica Parker that were perfect for these parts. Even though this may not be either of their best films, they pulled off each of their roles well. If you are a fan of Tim Burton's films or love a good comedy give it a try you will enjoy it!

B000TFINY6|4.0|- THE GOOD<br /><br />The Episodes:<br />Yet another great Season of Lost.  I'm glad the writers really like to take chances and this season is a great example of them really stretching themselves after an Amazing second season.  In this season the Sawyer-Kate-Jake love triangle is further complicated with the addition of a forth, Juliet; we find out who the Others are; yet another layer is added to the Kwon family's history; lock grows increasing mysterious, and the aftermath of the second season finale is felt by all, especially Desmond and Charlie.  Desmond, who was only briefly introduced in the second season, is further developed and becomes one of the truly interesting standout cast members of the Season.  Top it all off with a stunning Season Finale, and you've got yourself a great season of Lost<br /><br />Quality of Product and Features:<br />I believe this was the first season of Lost to be transfered to Blu-Ray, so needless to say it really is beautiful.  The locations show off beautifully, the greens and blues really pop.  The blacks are nice and deep and the overall picture quality is excellent; you can just feel the stubble on Jack and Sawyers face.  The audio is good, not mind blowing, but gets the job done.  There are some feature commentaries on select episodes.  You get your usual on location features, extended scenes, and blooper reel.  Not a huge selling point for me, but its nice if you like that sort of thing.<br /><br />- THE BAD<br /><br />The Episodes:<br />I remember watching this season when it aired.  Unlike previous seasons there are some episodes that just feel like \\"fluff\\".  They seem like episodes that were put in since the writers were obligated to make 23 episodes. The episodes I'm mentioning are actually not that bad, they were just so painful to watch when they first aired since you were waiting all week to know what the HELL was going on after last week's killer episode only to be subjected to a fluff episode.  Watching the season again on Blu-Ray it really isn't so bad.  This season also gets criticism for starting off heavily \\"others\\" centric.  The momentum does change midway through the season and things swiftly return back to legendary television status by the later episodes.<br /><br />Quality of Product and Features:<br />I do have a minor gripe that they did not keep the box set features and packaging consistent between all Seasons.  Seasons 1 and 2, which were released later on Blu-Ray, have a different box, more subtitle and language tracks, with a better Season Play interface.  Season 1 and 2 just don't look right sitting next to Season 3 on my DVD shelf.  If you're sort of a box display nut, you might want to wait for the complete series box set out in August.so bad.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|I am a Harry Potter fan and have loved the movies.  They followed closely to the book on some things, but to me key parts were left out.  So much info on what made Voldemort tick was in many of the \\"flashback/memories\\" collected that we did not get to see. SO much that is important to the final installment.  And don't get me started on how disappointing the ending was.  WHAT happened to the big fight scene at the school, the chaos, which was done so well in the 5th movie!?  I understand you have to cut things out, but they could have left out the made up fight at the Weasleys.  Ok if you didn't read the books, but most people following the movies have been following the books.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I admit I was never much of a horror movie person. So many of them were either cheap slasher or gore-fested zombie flicks and almost always featured casts of characters that were either complete wusses or lacked any kind of logic whatsoever to actually embrace and fight off said antagonism effectively. But every now and then, I'd be lucky to see a film that goes beyond the stereotypes of just \\"surviving\\" and, indeed, see those characters take matters into their own hands. Zombieland is one of those films, and a darn fun one at that. Probably most comparable to the recent Shaun of the Dead (whom director Ruben Fleischer acknowledges as an influence), Zombieland takes the old, recycled concept of zombie-ism and infuses it with a distinct style that makes it not just scary and tense, but also funny and witty. I, personally, find it very refreshing when a movie can exceed beyond its own conventions and create something new and contemporary such as Shaun of the Dead with its British humor and now Zombieland with its American quirkiness and references to popular culture. In fact, the whole survival tactics and comedy bits remind me of an old video game from the '90s called Zombies Ate My Neighbors. I don't remember too much about the game itself, but seeing the essence of action comedy that Zombieland is makes me think of it; running through towns, killing zombies, using otherwise absurd household items and scavenged weapons at your disposal to rack up points. Think of Zombieland as being one big video game come to life and everything will feel that much more entertaining. And it also doesn't hurt that the film has excellent chemistry between the actors and actresses. Woody Harrelson is especially amazing in his role as Tallahassee being the big, bad zombie-killer with an odd, yet addicting sense of humor, which is equally well-complimented by Jesse Eisenberg's role as Columbus.    Video - 4.5    Presented by Sony in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec in an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.40), Zombieland looks excellent. The predominant color of black (important for the gloom and doom of zombies) is the showcase here with very pronounced levels appearing deep and inky when need be for the many nighttime and darkness shots. Slight grain is present in these scenes, but never overwhelms. Colors such as red (lots and lots of red) are also prominent and vibrant. Contrast is excellent, revealing great amounts of detail in objects and lines as well. A few closeups did feel a bit distracting, however, with somewhat less sharpness in skin textures. But other than that, Zombieland looks excellent. The CG and slow-motion effects in the opening credits look especially well-integrated.    Audio - 5.0    Sony delivers with yet another outstanding DTS-HD 5.1 track. Separation of dialogue, sound effects, and music are flawless emanating from every respective speaker and thoroughly engaging the sub-woofer throughout the entirety of the movie. LFEs are most discernible in the sound of gunshots and music, though never really achieve to the level of blockbuster movie-type sound designs. However, that doesn't stop Zombieland from creating a very immersive sound field that is still as booming and proficient as the rest of the best. Dialogue is clear with no distortion or dropout, while high and low ends are reproduced perfectly. In particular, I find the music to be a big part of the fun factor and the way it instrumentally divides itself between the front speakers, in addition to how well it balances out with explosive bursts of zombie screams, head bashes, and other miscellaneous types of bodily damage and dismemberment.    Extras - 3.5    There are only two noteworthy standalone vignettes I cared about in the actual extras menu: the \\"Searching for Zombieland\\" and \\"Zombieland is Your Land\\" features. Both give a decent amount of information about the creation and filming process, but I was a little disappointed in the degree of depth. Thankfully, though, they make up for it a little bit in the P-i-P and commentary tracks. However, I would've preferred they play the P-i-P material as a standalone behind-the-scenes feature, since I found it a little distracting that it would switch from a small, quiet box to a loud and boisterous film (the sound discrepancy can be jarring). Overall these are informative enough, but not well organized.    Overall - 4.5    Zombieland is essentially the U.S. Shaun of the Dead. Audiences may not like it as much, or may even like it more based on their own personal tastes. But regardless, I like to think they both have their own positives and should at least be equally enjoyed for managing to succeed in the creation of a fresh, new take on the zombie genre. Zombieland is a fun and fast-paced ruckus with a certain amount of charm and wit that will probably grow on you if you haven't already embraced it. With great aptitude for a first-time director, Ruben Fleischer, accompanied by an excellent cast and script, does an admirable job taking what we know, adding a little modernization to it, and, in the end, producing a very well-made film. With an above-average, albeit somewhat disorganized, set of extras, excellent video, and reference audio I highly recommend this for action and horror fans. Rule #32: enjoy the little things.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|Surrogates, starring Bruce Willis, is a Sci-Fi flick that has a whole new take on robots.  Once again, I am going to complain about all the critics and so-called critics out there who like to demolish movies like this.  Here's the scoop:    It's obvious, and we have known for a while now, that Hollywood is running out of ideas.  Book authors, it seems, aren't, but movie writers are.  Why?  I have no idea, whatsoever.  What I do know is that sequel after sequel after sequel after remake after remake after remake are coming from that star-infested little town by the City of Angels.  Now it seems that when anything comes out of there with a sense of freshness and newness, its shot down by critics like the plague.  Case in point...Surrogates.  An original idea presented in an original way by a VERY good cast, but since its not another remake or a sequel, it has been bashed up one side and down the other...over and over and over again.    C'mon, people.  If we are so lucky to experience a NEW idea for a change, then give it the kudos it deserves!  This movie wasn't five-star material--it could have been, I think, if it would have delved just a bit deeper into the psyche of the people living their lives as surrogates as opposed to experiencing life first hand--but it was definitely four-star, and this is why:    1. Excellent casting  2. Excellent acting - made you almost believe that the surrogates were, indeed, surrogates  3. Excellent directing - Bruce looked so severely out of place in his own skin amongst the populace of surrogates (great job with this)  4. Original story  5. Atmospheric, almost to a claustrophobic degree  6. Awesome production value    Four Stars ****
B001FB4W02|2.0|I've been watching Smallville for a long time know and I have to say this was probably my least favorite Season.  The slow decline after Season 4 continues.  Though Season 7 was mildly disappointing, there were standout episodes and story arcs that really kept fans, like me, coming back for more.  The Veritas story arc and the handful of Lex episodes saved that season.  Season 8 on the other hand is just super disappointing all around.      In some ways this Season was supposed to be a payoff season.  You finally see Lana and Clark together.  But Lana is no longer who she once was, so the whole Clark and Lana relationship just doesn't carry the same emotional gravity it did years ago.  Sort of a sad way to see Kristen Kreuks leave the show.  Along with this, I had some high hopes for the Doomsday/Bloom story line. What you get are seriously unbelievable sequences of decisions made by Chloe.  Her motivations and actions just don't add up to any logical conclusion.  Just when you thought they could redeem things with a great season finale, everything just felt so rushed.  It was like someone pushed fast forward on the Blu-Ray without letting anyone know what was happening.  Unlike previous season finales where I was super excited to know what was going to happen next season, I felt horribly confused about what the heck happened in the last 10 minutes.     Do I recommend this season?  If you're a die hard fan of the series, then yes, you need to watch this season especially with how well Season 9 is turning out to be.  Just be sure to keep your expectations low. Again, just one man's opinion.

0143038419|1.0|I have never taken the time to do a review of any book online... but I absolutely think this book is crap and boring that I had to go to Amazon's website to write a review. I think the author is so self-absorbed that she has not really done any justice to researching and thinking what search for self and life's meaning really is. Granted that it's her book so she can talk about herself all she wants, and for some reason, a lot of people have bought her book that it has become a bestseller, there are so many more books that are more insightful on the same topic! I will be more wary next time when I see a New York Times Book Review that says a book is irresistible. Her book's a New York Times Notable Book... and I suddenly had this thought on whether author's can pay to get such accolade.

B000I2J6K0|4.0|I love this workout!!  You'll need a couch, space on the wall, and hard chair (like a kitchen table chair) to do the workouts, but just clear a 6x8 space in your den and you're ready to go.  It's just enough of a heart rate boost to get you going, but nothing that you'll need to worry about.  If it's too much aerobic for you, she shows modifications.  I'd recommend starting this (and other workouts) as early in your pregnancy as you can, so that you're not just starting at 20 weeks when it might be a bit hard the first time.    The first few times I did this, though, boy did my butt and thighs burn!  Lots of squats and glutes, which is good, but can be hard the first few times.  The 40-minute workout is actually more like 35 or so, since the first three minutes are intro, doctor warning, etc, and the end is relaxation.    What's awesome, though, is Erin herself.  She says funny things like, \\"you're holding that belly in, right?\\" or \\"If you need to pee, that's ok, just pause me, I don't like to work out alone.\\"  Fun stuff, upbeat and super supportive attitude.

B00275EGWY|5.0|Not only one of the best movies ever made in the War genre, but simply one of the best movies ever made. The  desert devistatingly hot conditions always present in Iraq while difussing I.E.D.'s and wearing a defensive heavey suit of materials designed to protect the difusser, portray a mood which adds to the already cliff hanging danger surrounding each mission. There are times when I found myself actually holding my breath as the difusser held wires in his gloved hand, looking throuh the viser of a cumbersome all enclosing helmet, and trying to determine just where to cut the wires without exploding the I.E.D.s were pathos beyond belief. This movie hit the theaters with little response when it first came out, similar to the movie Jerimiah Johnson. Both were brought back when it became clear that these movies were indeed something special, and like Jerimiah Johnson, 'The Hurt Locker' will become a classic for the ages. Better even than Stanley Kubrik's, Heavy Metal Jacket.
1591843162|5.0|Great, fun read - as usual for Godin. Sure, as some other comments point out, there is lots of literature out there with similar messages; however, Godin has a storyteller touch. He's certainly got his formula down for selling his words, ideas, and thoughts -- but he's worked hard at it. Nicely done.     Sure, he's known as a marketing guru -- yet so many of his books have this message of get out there and be someone - make something of yourself. The factory mentality is everywhere; look at the old feeling of getting a government job and settling in for the next 40 years.     Nothing wrong with that if that's what you're into - but then what the hell you going to do when the bubble bursts and you're laid off in year 29 because of government cutbacks across the board.     Know what you stand for and go out there and stand for it. There's a saying I have on a poster on my wall: \\"It's simple to make a difference... make a choice\\". Wise words, and certainly implicit in Godin's message in this book.     I track his blog daily. Love the short, concise posts - and sure some of the books are sometimes the blogs reproduced. So what - they're timely messages.     Complaints from folks about wanting the message for free - flooey... Godin gives tonnes of his time and messages away for free (that what a blog is).     I've used his blog posts and books to inform many of my posts on salmon-related issues on the West Coast of North America. [...]  specific to this book [...]

0553582038|4.0|This is not going to be a review, but I had a few things I wanted to say, because the negative reviews are so overwhelmingly negative.     I feel that all negative reviewers fall into one of these categories.     1) People bitter that their favorite characters have died.  2) People who feel that the book took too long to come out.   3) People who are angry that \\"A dance with dragons\\" hasnt come out YET.   4) People who are just angry at GRRM for not producing these books fast enough.     I think most of us fall into one of those categories.     HOWEVER     None of those things changes the fact that this book reads EXACTLY like the last three, has the same type of plot devices, and falls right in line with what I expected the book to be like. So its hard to even place all the anger that people are espousing here without placing them in one of the above categories.     Just wanted to get that out there for people who are reading these books in quick succession. You will enjoy this book greatly, as I have, and be restless for the next one to be released.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|Mild Spoiler Alert. The story unfolds with two marshals searching for a patient missing from a secluded mental institution on Shutter Island that houses society's most dangerous, demented individuals. The edgy score tells us that something sinister is going on, that someone at the institution is hiding something, and that the marshals' lives may be in danger. It becomes clear that marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has some hidden personal problems, some related to his g.i. days as flashbacks show him participating in the liberation of Nazi concentration camp victims and the execution of the camp guards. As Daniels and his partner probe deeper into the institution, and as Daniels suffers increasingly troubling hallucinations, you become anxious for resolution. This is answered in a gripping reality twist as Daniels' problems are painfully revealed by staff psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley).<br /><br />Acting is excellent. DeCaprio gets increasingly better with each role he takes on. I first saw Van Sydow in two 70's thrillers, The Exorcist and Three Days of the Condor, and even though he's near 80, he still adds a chilling, evil flavor to any film even with only a minor role. On the downside, unnecessary and disturbing views of murdered children tell me that as much as I enjoy Scorcese, this film will not be as appealing to most viewers nor as successful as it should have been.
0307346617|3.0|I bought this book because I read an article about the 10 scariest books to read and this was one of them. NOT! Its a sloooow read, I didn't know what to expect but it certainly was MORE then this. The interview style of writing, bouncing around the world talking to various people how they handled Zombie attacks, AND the politics,politics, politics just bored me to death. There were parts that were interesting about rebuliding America after the plague (putting criminals in stocks and public whippings for example) but zzzzzzzzz's for the most part. When I read a book like this I like to feel the tension and fear, I want to be afraid. This did none of it for me. Oh well....on to the next one.

B001UV4XWY|3.0|I really had no idea what to expect when my husband and I sat down to watch this last night. We had stayed away when the movie was playing in the theaters because of all the negative reviews, but finally decided to rent it. I have to say that despite some questionable and confusing plot twists and story arcs (and boy, are there plenty of those), I liked it. It's hard to define why this movie appealed to me - I'm not really a sci-fi fan and this movie definitely has sci-fi elements in it. I think it was the philosophical elements underlying the story that made me relate to the film. Based on a short story \\"Button Button\\" by Richard Matheson (who also wrote \\"I Am Legend\\"), the movie itself veers away from the original plot (the short story was succint and quite straightforward).<br /><br />The story is set in Virginia in the late 70s (1979 to be exact). A suburban couple, Arthur and Norma Lewis seem to be leading an idyllic life with their adolescent son. Arthur (James Marsden) works for NASA and Norma (Cameron Diaz) teaches at a private school. All is not well though as Norma receives news that the school will no longer provide a tuition discount for faculty member's children, and Arthur is given the devastating news that his application to be trained as an astronaut was rejected. In the midst of all these disappointments, the couple receive a mysterious package containing a strange box. The next day, a horribly disfigured man, Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) arrives on their doorstep and informs Norma that pushing the button will cause someone the couple does not know to die, but it will also ensure their financial security with a million dollar pay-off. The couple is given 24 hours to decide. Well, Norma's decision sets off a series of events that are as compelling to watch as they are strange and befuddling.<br /><br />I say befuddling because there are so many themes explored here - mind control, the possibility of a highly intelligent alien life form, ethical choices, the concepts of free will, damnation, salvation, and the afterlife, gateways to a different dimension, etc. It's a story that one needs to follow from the beginning as the movie itself is heavy in symbolism and dialogue - and the viewer who follows it all the way through just might be rewarded with some insights. That being said, I ultimately gave this movie 3 stars because the story could have been told without all these cluttering plot devices. It just serves to confuse the viewer, without it being necessary. Cameron Diaz's portrayal of Norma goes over the top (I think Charlize Theron would have done a better job in the role), Marsden is okay, the kid who plays their son is wooden in his acting, and Langella's role was well-played (in fact, his role could have done with a bit more in-depth exploration).<br /><br />It is seldom easy to adapt a short story into a full-length feature, and by using his own poetic license in telling this story, I fear the director made the story overly melodramatic and confusing, detracting from the true message of the movie (and depending on the way you view it, there may be a couple of those in there!).ncepts of free will, damnation, salvation, and the afterlife, gateways to a different dimension, etc. It's a story that one needs to follow from the beginning as the movie itself is heavy in symbolism and dialogue - and the viewer who follows it all the way through just might be rewarded with some insights.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I am a big fan of The Seven Percent Solution, so this energetic version of Sherlock Holmes suits me just fine.     Robert Downey Jr. is great as a younger, more pugalistic version of Holmes than people are used to seeing (the curse of Basil Rathbone). Jude Law is also a very good Dr. Watson, less bumbling than the usual Watson, which I also liked. I really was'nt expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did, but the action, acting, atmosphere, story line and the cinematography won me over.    The plot revolves around Holmes trying to thwart the nefarious plans of a man thought to be a ghost. I liked the Illuminati references in the movie, depicting how the upper-crust of British society was into occult practices, which is not a fantasy. There are alot of well designed action scenes in this film that did not over-power the film. Guy Ritchie has managed to revitalize a very dormant franchise with this film, I hope there are more waiting in the wings.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I came upon this book by accident, but what a story. I couldn't put it down. The author did such a good job carrying two story lines and keeping your interest in both. I didn't know the story of what the French Police did but the horror was just the same. Sarah's story broke my heart. It was a story of the holocaust and it is as real today as it was 60 years ago. I recommend this book to anyone who loves history. Hate is a terrible thing and we should all try to see our fellow man as a brother and not someone to murder. This book has deeply affected me and I will remember it for sometime to come.
B000MG1ZFQ|5.0|In 1969 Soft Parade was recorded by the hard rockin' Doors, horns were added, Jim Morrison was doing his crooning thing, the public and the critics just didn't know how to take this.  Now in 2010 if you sit down, pay close attention and listen, you realize these college graduates created a masterpiece, something real special, a recording ahead of it's time. Jim Morrison never sounded better, imagine Frank Sinatra singing Tell All The People, a perfect fit. You gotta love Running Blues, \\"poor Otis dead and gone left us here to sing his songs\\". The incomparable Wild Child, a sure-fire Morrison signature rocker. The nine minute Soft Parade could've easily fit on Sgt. Pepper...\\"this is the best part of the trip I really like, proud to be a part of this number\\"...Soft Parade. The 2007 remix remastering is a different story, this is for the Doors collectors who already own everything previously released, basically new parts were added from the master tapes that were not used on the originals, Morrison's vocals are sometimes drowned out, the remixes lack the punch power of the originals, the overall audio. I'd recommend to start with the original recordings, remastered, you'll find this in the Perception box set with all the Doors studio recordings, the two disc Legacy covers the best, the cheaper route to hear the original remastered sound.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Great that there coming out with Tombstone but they should have put both versions on the disc. And lets hope that the transfer is good. Or we will have another Gangs of New York or Gladiator issue. I hope these company's will be good enough to release a great looking movie before they throw it on the shelves. Hell I know they just want money thats why they release the barebones or crap version first. Then wait 3 months and release what everyone wanted. DVD did it why not Blu-ray I guess.
0743455967|2.0|I have to admit, it has been no less than 5 years since I read this book, BUT I remember the effect it had on me at the time.  I was struggling greatly and found myself unable to sit down and write. Steven King told me that I should quit.  He told me that if I couldn't write a thousand words every day, I couldn't be a writer.  It has been in the back of my mind ever since.  I had never thought of King as a great writer, but I respected both his output and his success (I still do.)  He, however, has no business giving such advice.  It stuns me that he has never had trouble sitting down to write, and I cannot help but feel that his drinking/drug problem was his cure for such issues.  In any event, any connection between his writing and his addictions goes unaddressed...    If you are like me, and you don't need extremely tired advice like \\"Write the first draft with the \\"door\\" closed, and the second draft with it open.\\", but need help actually sitting down.  If there is something in your bones that pulls you away from your work, tells you anything to keep you from writing: \\"Oh, I'm tired... I have accomplished enough for the day... I need to pay my water bill... What's new on Digg today?... My favorite show is on...\\" read Steven Pressfield's book [[ASIN:0446691437 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]].  The first two sections of THAT book spoke to me in the way I had hoped King's book would (too bad I stumbled onto it just 2 months ago).     If, however, you are just a King fan looking to learn more about him and his process, then read this.      PS  I now write over a thousand words everyday, no thanks to King.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This version of Emma does include the scenes which were omitted by PBS during it's Masterpiece Classic airing. I found that they contributed quite a bit toward the storyline and am glad that I got the chance to watch the full epsidodes. Over all a very lighthearted telling of Jane Austen's classic that stays very close to the original details.
078322737X|2.0|American Graffiti has always been one of my favorite movies; I have absolutely NO critcism of the film. I would rate the movie itself with 5 stars. But... this review is in regard the extremely poor quality of the DVD. I am purplexed that many say the DVD picture qualtiy is good, because that is my major complaint.  The scenes are all extremely dark; you can barely see what is going on even after adjusting the light levels on your televison. I played this DVD on a HDTV 50 inch large screen televison - maybe if I played it on an old tube TV the picture quality would have been better??  Also.. as others noted, the sound quality is not as good as the original film.  Very disappointing purchase - I expected better picture and sound quality from a DVD.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|This movie was very good.  As well as it came to my house with in two days after ordering it.  And they even left a little thank you on the order form.  Most of all my two year old daughter loves it and watches it about a dozen times.

B0035G9ABG|5.0|Yessir. I'm a bona fide Gorillaz fan(atic). Here has been my experience with the album thus far.    Three songs hit me immediately. Stylo, Rhinestone Eyes and To Binge. The rest didn't come easy at first. Partly because I didn't have time to give them a fair listen and partly (mostly) because Gorillaz does that to me. When I got the first album, I put it away immediately, only to be bored one day and give it a fair listen and fell in love. Demon Days was definitely easier on the ears first listen, but I cannot say that the first few spins were as lovely as now. Plastic Beach is no different. I got the feeling that I wouldn't like it at first. Kinda saddened me. I knew however that I'd keep it in my car every trip for a while to see if it would catch me. Today I got the smile on my face, knowing that this album won't disappoint. I can't stop playing this and it probably won't for a while.    I guess this is a word of caution to the casual listener. This album requires patience, especially if you're not familiar with Gorillaz.  But not much at all, that's especially if you are. The best part about it is when you are on your third, fourth or fifth play through and a track hits you, it does so with a bullet.    Well, for me at least but that's all I can really offer is my opinion right? Hope this helps.
0783240236|5.0|One day, the birds just go nuts and start killing people! Now, in anyone else's hands, this could have been a ridiculous disaster. Under the supreme guidance of Alfred Hitchcock, THE BIRDS is a genuine horror classic! The phonebooth, attic, and house-under-siege scenes are fantastic! Tippy Hedren, Rod Taylor, and Jessica Tandy star, w/ Suzanne Pleschette in a very memorable death scene!...
0385528752|5.0|Henry David Thoreau said: \\"Things do not change, we change.\\"<br /><br />But how do we change? Why are some changes so difficult to make?<br /><br />The authors, Chip and Dan Heath, examine the obstacles we often encounter when attempting to change the behavior of ourselves, as well as helping other people or organizations to make beneficial changes.<br /><br />They begin by explaining that each of us have a rational side and an emotional side. They use the analogy of a huge, powerful elephant as our emotional side, and the rider of the elephant as our rational side. They say that if we want to make changes we have to appeal to both sides. When both sides work together change can come easily.<br /><br />The book presents a framework that can guide you in any situation where you need to change behavior:<br />  1] Direct the Rider<br /><br />  2] Motivate the elephant<br /><br />  3] Shape the Path<br /><br />Among the insights offered are some about resistance and self-control.  They say that what appears to be resistance is often a lack of clarity.  The rider isn't sure exactly which way to go, and consequently spins his wheels.  They make it clear that self-control, unfortunately, is an  exhaustible resource, and that the bigger the change to be made, the more it saps people's self-control. When our self-control is drained the mental muscles we need to focus, to think creatively, to inhibit our impulses, and to persist in the face of frustration or failure become weakened as well. So change is often hard not because people are lazy, but because they are worn out. Exhausted.<br /><br />There are numerous case studies and real-life situations cited that demonstrate how to deal with resistance and self-control while using  this framework to manifest successful changes. However, the authors caution that this framework is not a panacea. Sometimes people just flat out don't want to change.  Therefore they don't promise that making changes will be always be easy, but their approach will make it easier.<br /><br />The elephant analogy reminded me of an elephant safari I was on in Thailand.  Quite an experience.  Reading this book was not as exciting, but infinitely more valuable. Their framework is based on decades of scientific research, is easy to remember, and flexible enough to use in many different situations: work, family, community, and other. Highly recommended.ier.    The elephant analogy reminded me of an elephant safari I was on in Thailand.  Quite an experience.  Reading this book was not as exciting, but infinitely more valuable.

0446618306|5.0|I watched the movie first and i didn't understand why Savannah did such a choice. In the movie she said that She didn't have a choice. But i didn't make any sense to me. So i left the theatre with a big question WHY? and i was mad...So i decided to read the book to find the answer.  But the book was different. I enjoyed every detail of it, and also the differences between the book and the movie. I was happy that John didn't injured while he was in war.   i didn't know that this book would make me that sad in the end, but when i read the last 2 pages of the book, i cried so hard because my heart was just breaking. I could't even breath normally. John's sacrifice was way too much for me. It reminded me of Jesus. Only Jesus would do such a sacrifice as this. I awfully feel bad for him, but at the same time i adored him.   I understood again, what true love means.  I truely thankful to the author Nicolas Sparks.  He is a gifted man from God...Thank you...

B001OQCV6K|5.0|Because it was clearly a film made by S.H. fans for S.H. fans. I was blown away by this film. I loved it, and I can't wait to own it. I'm a long-time fan of all things Sherlock Holmes, but was never content with the watered down Rathbone interpretation of the character and stories. I love the A&E series (and have all of these) and Jeremy Brett interpretation. Downey got it right and even better was the contemptuous but platonically affectionate friendship of Doctor Watson. Chemistry all around was really great. The action scenes were breathtaking - both physical and mental and the audience is right there in the scene. The story was downright original. I can't say enough good about this film.
0743298039|4.0|\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is Diane Setterfield's debut novel, much praised for its literary quality and the return to \\"good old-fashioned writing\\". I do believe in progress and, if I want good old-fashioned writing, I pick up a Hemingway or a Dickens. Be that as it may, Setterfield's novel is engaging and rather interesting, even if I do dislike a perpetual gloominess and generally chilly atmosphere in any novel.<br /><br />Margaret is a bookworm who spends her life surrounded by her father's old and invaluable books. She is also a writer, finding obscure people and topics to write about. When she receives a letter from a famous writer, Vida Winter, Margaret is intrigued. Ms. Winter is a recluse and a most prolific English writer, having written fifty three books during her career. Though exceptionally prolific, Ms. Winter is aggressively private and stand-offish, to the chagrin of many a journalist who attempted to write her life story.<br /><br />Ms. Winter surprised Margaret by offering her a commission of writing her official biography. Margaret at first declines, but gets involved in the excellent storytelling of Vida Winter, who takes Margaret on a journey of the life that led to Vida becoming Vida, starting with her grandparents. Appealing to Margaret's own private ghosts, Vida weaves her final story on her own terms - meaning no questions allowed. Margaret is introduced to a wealthy English family who slowly fell apart through the devious and violent behavior of Vida's relatives, behavior that led to actions well-hidden and almost forgotten. The story has it all: mysterious deaths, runaway children, mental problems, secret children, fires and seduction.<br /><br />It took me a while to read the first part of the book (this also happened to me with \\"Atonement\\"), and I persistently fell asleep while trying to push through to a more interesting part. I remember the numerous cups of hot cocoa that Margaret had, as well as her process of sharpening specific pencils.As with \\"Atonement\\", I gave myself a pep-talk each time I picked the book back up. Half-way through the book, the story started to pick up.<br /><br />Most people like a good mystery, and \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" has all the makings of one. It is not about the realism of a story, but the way the story is told. I read the second part of the novel in one gulp, maybe because I started ignoring Margaret's cups of cocoa and maybe because she stopped feeling sorry for herself as much. I must admit that Vida Winter's story was irresistible and engaging, once it truly got going.<br /><br />Setterfield seems to be a very promising author, though I would have to prepare myself for another of her books. While I understand that many readers love this style of writing, I am not one of them, and this is merely my opinion.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a relatively good mystery novel, with a good plot that spans five generations in all. Setterfield did a good job connecting these generations through the realization of the dysfunctionality of Vida Winter's family. I found the novel too long and too gloomy, but its literary value is nonetheless undeniable. Recommended.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|Leonardo DiCaprio  is fantastic as Teddy Daniels. Also this fim does a great job of making you the viewer feel delusional.  That being said I thought this film was quite dark and perhaps even evil.   Humanity loses out in this film.    Furthermore it was a thinly veiled attack on those unfortunate few who are attempting to thwart the system.     For example Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA did exist.  (Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA,) From Wikipedia   MKULTRA was the code name for a covert CIA interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. This official U.S. government program began in the early 1950s, continuing at least through the late 1960s, and it used United States and Canadian citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MK-ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methods, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function. And worse hospitals and Doctors did partake in such experiments.   This sinister Dr Ewen Cameron was just one of the few to partake in mind control experiments.     The experimental treatment they use on Marshal Daniels I felt was a bit over the top as well.    This film in terms of suspending disbelief and creating a dream like hell is even more sophisticated then Avatar.    I though this film should also have been Rated R.
0060764899|5.0|I am a big fan of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", as well as \\"Harry Potter\\", so it seemed only natural that I should also read C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I never read them as a child, but then again I stem from the third world, where these occurrences are not unusual. After watching the movie, I decided to give the book a try. At first I was unsure where to start the series, as there is still a debate as to which order the books should be read in, but I went with the first book in the series that was published, as this made the most sense to me.<br /><br />I am so very glad that I picked up \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\"! The book is actually tiny - less than 200 pages, with illustrations - but packed full of adventure. Most people are familiar with plot, but for those fellow \\"third-world-ers\\" I will rehash some of it. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are four siblings in the WWII England, who get sent to a kindly professor's house in the country to be safe from the German air-raids. They are amazed by the size of the house, and decide to explore it on rainy days. During one of those days Lucy, the youngest sibling, entered a room that contained only a wardrobe. Upon entering the wardrobe, behind the coats, Lucy encountered a different world, with snow and woods and a lamp post.<br /><br />Lucy ended up meeting a Faun called Mr. Tumnus - a half man, half goat, who introduced Lucy to Narnia, the world that she entered, a world ruled by a White Witch, who called herself the Queen of Narnia. Of course, the one true King is Aslan, the giant talking Lion, who is planning on returning to Narnia and bring Christmas and then spring and summer back with him. In order to do this, Aslan needs to fill the four thrones in the castle currently occupied by the White Witch. The four thrones can only be occupied by humans, as foretold by a prophecy.<br /><br />Lucy returned to her world via the same wardrobe. On a different day, while tryingto escape the grumpy housekeeper and a group of tourists going around the professor's house, all four siblings hide in the wardrobe. Not believing Lucy's Narnia story before, the siblings are surprised and apologetic when they, too, end up in Narnia. Deferring to Lucy as a way of apology, all the siblings go with Lucy to meet Mr. Tumnus. They are all surprised to see Mr. Tumnus missing and his place raided, as they find out that Mr. Tumnus was arrested by the White Witch for abetting humans.<br /><br />The White Witch found out about Mr. Tumnus' nefarious activities through Edmund, who entered Narnia on his own while one day looking for Lucy. Edmund met the White Witch, who gave him Turkish Delight. The food was enchanted, and Edmund wanted more of it. The White Witch promised Edmund rooms full of Turkish Delight if he brought his siblings with him the next time he was in Narnia.<br /><br />This is just the beginning. The children end up meeting Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them go to Aslan, while Edmund (believing the White Witch was not that bad), escaped to the castle, where he got imprisoned by the White Witch, who then took Edmund on a harrowing journey of looking for Peter, Susan and Lucy. But the snow is already melting, and the spring is coming, so the Witch needs to hurry, as the prophecy is about to be fulfilled, which would mean the death of the Witch.<br /><br />Ah, this book was such a pleasure to read! Lewis wrote this book as a story for his god-daughter Lucy, and at first intended the story to be just that - a story and not a series. The book is written very simply - one can easily imagine the author telling it to a bunch of kids, adding asides for dramatic effect or as a way of explanation. Although the book is written in a very simple language, its plot is actually quite complicated and covers amazingly well developed characters in such a short span.<br /><br />Lewis, who was a good friend of Tolkien, was truly a master of the genre, as this children's book is so well loved by adults, as it has themes that can translate to any age. \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is also the simplest of all the books in the series, as far as language is concerned, as it was obviously originally intended for a very specific and small audience. I am very glad that the book found a larger audience than that. The book is wonderful in that it teaches courage, loyalty, forgiveness, strength, endurance and sacrifice, among other things, while immersing the reader in a plot in which they cheer and sit at the edge of their seat. The illustrations propel the reader into the world of Narnia, and illuminate all that our adult imagination might have forgotten.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a fantastic children's fantasy book, that would be very hard to match, and that, one can safely say, serves as a basis and a starting point for all fantasy writers of today. And well it should, as Lewis was one of the masters, and \\"The Lion...\\" was just one taste. Highly recommended.
1400052173|4.0|This book was an excellent read.  All the complicated jargon was kept to a minimum, and the medical/legal terms were fully explained.  Although the book skips around in time, the story was easy to follow.  I don't usually read books in one sitting, since leisure time is short, but this book was devoured in only a few hours.  Skloot's first book is a real winner, and I can't wait to read her next work.  Great job!
0312380852|5.0|This book is inspirational for beginners and  even experienced knotters, who may be tempted to borrow some ideas from Annika's creations.    Since none of us was born with knotting skills, those of us who want to learn must have good teachers and good resources for learning. Annika does that effortlessly in this book.     The photographs show every knot clearly so even beginners can follow the step-by-step instructions with confidence. There is a lot of technical advice on materials,design and construction (like what NOT to do when making a necklace).  The tips, tools and equipment section is very helpful for beginners as well as for experienced knotters who can still learn a thing or two.     The finished jewellery looks decadent. Too bad the photo on the front cover wasn't as impressive as some of the exquisite pieces toward the back of the book. That was an injustice.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Valleys of Neptune feels like what might have happened next. This is an imperfect album, but it is head and shoulders better than anything that has been released from the foot locker of Hendrix tapes. I'm a huge fan; this album holds a warm place in my Hendrix collection.<br /><br />Listening to this album I was transported back to the early seventies, laying on the living room floor, parents not home, with the volume up as loud as my ears could stand (maybe 7 or 8), listening between two homemade Bose 901 replica speakers. The sound was horrible, but the music was incredible - Hendrix, Are You Experienced. Over forty years later, I can almost see Hendrix standing in my room, nobody is around, the sound system is a million times better, I can actually feel the bass now, and it is turned up as loud as my ears can stand (-14db - there's no 10 or 11 anymore). My ears are still ringing as I write this review, but I'm grinning ear to ear.<br /><br />The sound on this CD is remarkable. The first notes of Stone Free are crystal clear, sharp, and incredibly well defined. The first four tracks (Stone Free, Valleys of Neptune, Bleeding Heart, and Hear My Train A Comin') are as good as anyone could ever get, given the source recording material. Things go a lot south on Mr. Bad Luck, there is a lot of tape hiss in the background, and the sound is much flatter than those first four tracks. The recording quality picks up somewhat on the remaining tracks, Red House is particularly fine. Just remember though, the worst track on this CD is far superior to any of the other issues of previously unreleased studio recordings.<br /><br />There is something about these recordings that I do not understand at all, almost every track fades away during the song, sometimes right in the middle of a guitar solo. Did they do this because there are significant recording errors, the tracks aren't complete, Hendrix yelled something, or the music was just bad? Or did they do something really wrong; fade away because they mixed this to a time limit for the whole CD? That would be the worst answer possible, and it would make me rather angry. I certainly hope that the Experience Hendrix Corporation didn't decide to fade out tracks so that they could sell two bonus tracks to certain stores - Target and Best Buy.<br /><br />I think this is an album that might have been. It's highly unlikely that it would have been published back in the sixties or seventies without a lot more work and rerecording. The first four tracks have a ton of potential. The remaining eight are more experimental, probably testing out how these songs would sound. I'm certain nobody ever thought Sunshine of your Love would be released on an album, it is an odd rendition of the song, driving a bit too fast with no vocals.<br /><br />As a piece of history, this CD is incredible. We get to hear Hendrix really play. The mix was done to really focus on his guitar playing and vocals. The drum beat and bass line are relegated to the back of the music. These tracks would have never been mixed that way for public release. Mastering technology has changed so much in the past forty years. We are the beneficiary with clean and sharp new releases. Even with all these great new tools, tape hiss is still evident, and there are some random moments where loud static shows up or the notes are clipped and muddied. I didn't count all those moments, but there are at least five short bursts of bad sound.<br /><br />The CD I reviewed and own is the twelve track version. I understand there are fourteen track versions available as exclusive items from other stores. I've not heard those other two tracks, but given the direction some of these tracks went, I can't imagine that those are phenomenal recordings.<br /><br />The CD includes a booklet with nine pages of tiny type written by John McDermott (there are also a bunch of really great pictures in the twenty four pages total). Sadly this long story just feels contrived.Everything is about how Jimi did this, or did that, or told people to do these things; how he was the genius behind everything that had anything to do with this music. I think Hendrix was a genius, he was an incredible guitar player, but he wasn't everything. And it just feels wrong when I read, over forty years later, somebody recounting what a person said, thought, and felt. The looking glass can be very fuzzy over the years. The Experience Hendrix Corporation is just that, a company trying to make money and some of these antics are exactly that, merchandising. But it is Hendrix, the music is the point.<br /><br />Even with the flaws, and the hambone merchandising I still think this is a remarkable CD. The music is outstanding.Everything is about how Jimi did this, or did that, or told people to do these things; how he was the genius behind everything that had anything to do with this music.

B002VECM4A|5.0|This was a very powerful movie, the characters were well portrayed. I cannot imagine anyone living a life like this, but I know there are many.  This movie is about abuse at the highest level, and getting past it. See it today.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|The opening scene in Law Abiding Citizen should have been enough to tell me, this is not going to be a great movie. When the movie opens with bucolic sweet scenes in the lovely suburban house, and there is a knock on the door - don't answer the door! You'd think movie characters would understand that by now. I spoil nothing by telling you that two men bind and gag the wife and husband (Gerard Butler), stab both of them, then one rapes the mother while the daughter stands in the doorway (the rapist says, 'that's OK, kids like me').<br /><br />So if you can stomach that opening sequence, then this is the perfect movie for you. If, on the other hand, this sounds like a bad idea, please move on and don't rent or purchase this film. Sadly, I forged ahead and watched the entire film. The highlight was somebody being dismembered with a cut off circular saw.<br /><br />There is a thriller in this movie. The ending sort of does explain the opening, why those two men were at Nick Rice's house. And there are a few interesting twists and turns. But generally this film is about low spots just waiting around for the next bit of gore or action sequence. Butler and Foxx are much better actors than this film.<br /><br />Clyde Shelton (Jamie Foxx - Tubbs in the Miami Vice movie), is a lawyer prosecuting Nick Rice (Gerard Butler - 300) for a vigilante murder. Clyde is most concerned with his nearly 100% conviction rate, and he won't let that record be spoiled by this crazy Nick guy. At moments the movie feels a little like Hannibal Lecter. But nowhere near that creepy, or intelligent, so Law Abiding Citizen is not nearly as good. I can't put my finger on why, but there is something similar to The Shooter.<br /><br />This was a big budget film. The camera work, sound, and special effects reflect all that money poured into this lovely film. Yes there is a polish to this work. The director did a really wonderful job with The Italian Job, it seems like F. Gary Gray might be a one hit wonder. This film show little care for pacing.<br /><br />Oh this is an R rated movie by a long margin. Pick your reason (actually there is no nudity), and it should only be viewed by a mature audience. The film displays graphic sick ways of killing people. To me, not something a younger audience should view.<br /><br />This was not a good film.

1416550550|4.0|A  4-year old girl arrives on the docks in Australia alone and unable to share her name with the dockmaster.  Taking pity on the girl the dockmaster takes her home with him.  Having experienced several miscarriages the couple raise the girl as their own.  On Nell's 21st birthday the truth sends her world spiraling. War and life interrupt her need for the truth about her heritage.  It isn't until 1975 that Nell truly embarks on a journey to find the truth. Coming close to the truth Nell is again forced to abandon her quest.  Cassandra, Nell's granddaughter, picks up the quest after Nell death.  By overlapping narratives, adding fairy tales, and including a red herring Morton has created a fascinating story that is hard to put down. The ending is a surprise.   The character in the story are likeable and the plot although not masterful is entertaining. The story lines can get a little confusing while jumping between several of the characters stories. However, I was thoroughly entertained and curious to see the characters find the answers for themselves. While this is not  a masterpiece it is a good read. I recommend the book for pure delights sake.  I plan on keeping this book on my shelf because I thought it was fun.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Having enjoyed both of her first books I will continue to read this author.
0307387178|5.0|A literary genius, Krakauer engages the reader so well that one puts it down still wallowing in the emotions of the main character, Christopher McCandless. A true story which begun from a journalist's work, Krakauer draws parallels between his obsession with the McCandless and his own life - where he was always seeking the next adventure, the next high. This book will absolutely connect you to the life of Christopher McCandless, who was simply a boy who challenged the rules in search of a life worth meaning.
0743298039|5.0|The delivery was timely and the book is a treasure!  From beginning to end this story entwines one into the lives of the characters and always presents an element of surprise and intrigue.  This was a fun read and I would recommend this seller without hesitation!
B002VUFKG6|2.0|As noted, this is no Eat, Pray, Love but a historical look at the history of marriage in Western culture interweaved with the author's own struggle with marriage.  While the historical information was interesting, it is hard to know if it is as slanted as the author's own opinionated view of marriage.  At times Gilbert does address the issues from all sides but more often than not the reader is forced to see her view of marriage as an unnecessary act which forces women to be submissive to cultural expectations which force them to give up their dreams and indivuality.  While a few stories touch on the surface the book lacks an in depth look at women who may choose to give of them selves to marriage and family which is in turn a deep part of their indivdual personality.      The book is mostly a ramble with light structure and it was interesting to see how the author delayed revealing an important \\"committment\\" she made until late in the book.  It seems there was really no struggle at all.  This isn't for light reading and is great if you need to drift off for some rest.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|If you've heard the Mumford & Sons singles then this album is much more of the same.  It's a clever mix of folk and rock, with meaningful lyrics to back it up.
0385737424|4.0|While I applaud this author for using such a brilliant book as a base for her own story, this has too much Wrinkle in it and not enough originality. The child characters aren't as interesting as the adult characters (I found myself wanting to know more about the mother rather than the daughter), and children will probably struggle with the time travel concepts. An interesting, fast read, but it just doesn't measure up to past Newbery medalists.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Synopsis:  Michael Moore explores the economic fallout that occured at the end of 2008 and the war on the middle class that preceded since the Reagan Administration.  Moore examines the difference between individual vs. corporate welfare and makes the argument that if the government's going to bail people out, they should be doing so from the bottom-up instead of the top-down.   Moore also explores his Catholic faith and argues as to whether or not Jesus would be supporting the values of the political party that invokes His name the most.      Now, I'm completely against gun control (if you ask me, gun control is using both hands), but I loved [[ASIN:B00008DDVV Bowling for Columbine]] because it was entertaining and I consider [[ASIN:B000SINT52 Fahrenheit 9/11]] to be his \\"magnum opus.\\"  This film was more \\"slapstick\\" than those previous releases (as well as [[ASIN:B000UNYJXQ Sicko]]) but still does make a valid point:  We live in a country where those with nothing can be thrown out on the streets while those who advocated and lobbied for both predatory lending practices and tax laws that are wildy unfavorable to the working class can be entitled to billions of dollars from the government and million-dollar \\"golden parachutes\\" from their employers without fear of penalty.  Those who favor Keynesian economics will love this film while fans of Laissez-faire economics will say \\"Hey, the govt. was overinflated to begin with; just because the Neo-conservatives were wrong doesn't mean left-based policies are right.\\"    The operative concept here is critical thinking.  One one hand, this country is in a recession because there was a war launched on the middle class... but the guy who made the film openly complained about his German-engineered (and Mexican-manufactured) automobile in [[ASIN:006098726X Stupid White Men]] while crying that Michigan was destroyed by the loss of manufacturing jobs in the automotive sector.  Hm.      All and all, it was a decent film that was humorous enough to recommend.  This isn't a news report; it's an entertaining documentary.  Keep that in mind at all times.

0307454541|1.0|It's too bad that Stieg Larsson could not have believed in his own talents enough to avoid appealing to the basest of human instincts to sell books.  I bought Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to read for book club.  But I'm sorry I spent one penny on it or read one word.  Men's brutality to women is not a subject that I care to read about.  How could the author look his own mother in the face after conceiving and writing of such brutality.  Not that the entire book is trash.  There is worthy material there, enough to keep me reading beyond the point where I should have bailed out.  But I did bail out long before the end and only wish I had done so sooner.

B001DCQIAU|4.0|Karajan recorded many of these works several times (and with variable results).  In general, his 1960's recordings have the greatest urgency, as he got older he tended to slow the pace and go for more heavily underlined phrasing and thick textures lacking in orchestral transparency.  The bulk of this set is from the 1970's, which many enjoy as a middle ground between his styles (which admittedly is something of an over generalization to help orient those intimidated by his massive discography).  The recording dates for this series are:  Beethoven 1975-77  Brahms 10/77-2/78  Bruckner 1975-76, 1979-81  Schumann 1971 (Symphonies 1-4), 1987 (additional live version of #4)  Mendelssohn 1971-72  Tchaikovsky 1967, 1976-77
B0035J6TAI|3.0|Peter Gabriel's newest disc, Scratch Your Back, is Peter's interpretations of other people's music.  While I am only familiar with about one half of the songs he has done for this album, I'll give you my opinion on all of them from my first couple of listenings.      Overall I find the CD listless, and to me Peter seems to be off his game.  Maybe I'm just used to the rock instrumentation...no, I loved The Book of Love from Shall We Dance.  It does not seem...organically Gabriel.  It's almost like Peter is doing a parody of himself.  Of the songs I know,  Waterloo Sunset, Book of Love, Boy in the Bubble, Heroes, Philadelphia, and Street Spirit,  I really like Book of Love and Waterloo Sunset.  I find the rest to be unworthy arrangements and a little off-putting, as Peter strains at some of the vocals.  Especially disappointing to me were Boy in the Bubble and Street Spirit.    As far as the other offerings go, My Body is a Cage is interesting...but that's it.    Overall, I find Peter does better with his own material.  I find this too safe and, well, dull.  I'll give this effort 2 1/2 stars.  Recommended for completists only.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|Everyone made such a big deal about 2012 but when watching it with my friends...we were all disappointed. The character that John Cusack played was a horrible father. Yellowstone Park was gated with WARNING SIGNS not to enter, but his character jumps the fence and encourages his kids to ignor the sign and to do same (no wonder this generation is corrupt...the media encourages it). This father also allows his children to witness the decaying of a dead animal who was evidently burnt by fire burning brimstone that seeped from the core which also dried up the lake. \\"Oh well kids, lets camp out near the site anyway. I see no danger.\\" Lets not forget he's a super hero who some how manages to save his family from being swollen by the earth....and several times he saves himself and others from scenes that are life threathening. First of all he's not Indiana Jones, second he's a washed out book author not James Bond and third what a waste of film. The Day After Tomorrow was far better than this movie.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Have you ever screamed AWESOME at a movie? Well don't because you'll just annoy other movie goers and get popcorn thrown at you. But if a movie ever deserved it, it would be this one.    The Phantom Menance WISHES it was as cool as this movie, but then again it wishes it was as cool as the Sahara. Poor Phantom Menance, and yet it makes a great comparison to Serenity, an underrated movie with one tenth the budget that delivers 5,000% square rooted by a prime string theory.    I might not know my maths, or what the capital of Uruguay is, but I do know my movies and my street address, and this is a movie not to be missed unless you've got some terminal 24 hour disease and then you should probably spend it saying goodbye to friends and family instead.    Great cast, great writing, things that go boom AND boo, what more could you ask for unless you were incredibly high maintenance? Nothing, that's what!    Watch it, otherwise you'll be missing out on a great movie experience and people will talk about you behind your back.

0785125965|2.0|Once I saw Hulk and the Warbound set up gladiator fighting in Madison Square Garden I really lost interest. I was hoping that Hulk was going to systematically hunt down the offending Illuminati in the same vein as great revenge movie.  The Sentry's presence is built up throughout the story and finally shows up at the end only to become a bigger menace and threat to the Marvel Universe. The Hulk and Sentry fight to a standstill until they both peter out to their weaker alter-egos. The main flaw I found was that it was hard to empathize with any of the characters in the book.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Back in the early 80's I walked into the local record store looking to purchase my first Bob Marley album. Knowing nothing other than I liked the few songs I had heard, I was clueless as to what album to get. The guy at the store recommended Babylon By Bus so I bought it. Over the years, I learned much more about Bob and his music and collected it all. But this album has always been the first thought in my mind when I think of Bob. The album was damaged & I purchased it on cassette. The cassette was lost somewhere in California in the 90's. Nostalgia had me out hunting for the CD off and on, but I was unable to find it anywhere & wondered if it was no longer in circulation. Then - I thought of checking Amazon. Wow! I just received it yesterday and had to listen to it immediately. The memories came flooding back. Every nuance of each performance. Bob's music & message is incredible. This recording is beautiful - I'm so happy to hear it again!
0738702994|5.0|I actually got this deck last November. It's taken me this long to feel I might be able to put into words how I feel about this deck.  Though I, (to quote Don Henley) live in \\"such a graceless age\\" that doesn't have much tolerence for such things, this deck really does at times make me want to swoon -- to fall into those images and stay for a long, long time. I feel it is the best deck I've ever come across for Tarot pathworking and meditation. I am on a Celtic path spirtually and through my heritage, so the tie-in to those myths just makes it even more perfect.  I feel very blessed to have found this deck, and along with the Celtic Dragon deck that I got for my birthday just last month, I know I've got my \\"comfort decks\\", the ones you can rely on and the images you can trust to show you what needs to be unveiled.    I know several other reviewers have commented on the lesser quality of the art in the Minors, but I don't find it a problem at all, and since the RWS deck is my foundational deck, I really like that she follows that tradition.  True, she switched the wands/swords elemental designation, but really, I can't say I notice it much at all! The deck is wide, but it's actually about 1/4\\" shorter than my Universal Waite deck, and the same length as the Celtic Dragon, so I guess what it's all about is that extra width to accomodate the border, but I love that too, so for me, I will just deal with the size.  Think of it this way, it's nowhere near as large as the almost billboard size cards of the large Crowley Thoth deck!  Now that's something to try to handle.    I am totally enchanted with Ferguson's abilities with the water color medium, the color saturation in those cards is sensual. It's a dignified, magical, welcoming deck that seems to call me to a healing place.
0545123267|4.0|Bought this book because of the connection to the Twilight/werewolf genre and was pleasantly surprised by an entertaining read. Although there were parts that were a bit stilted and slow, the latter part of the book was an exciting and quick read with a great twist ending. I would definitely recommend this to the 12+ set. It's not like so many other teen books --- there's no foul language and a very sweet love story. It definitely makes me want to read more from this writer.
0071592466|1.0|I bought this book; however, I didn't like it so much. This is only one book from a series including accounting, management, and many other subjects. I think this book is very superficial not only for that reason I mentioned but for the subjects it recovers. In fact, this book covers only some patterns for writing and speaking thats all. I don't know how that guy got 100 at the Toefl exam but this book just discuss a bit in speaking and writing. You can find many of this information in any grammar books.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a brilliant workout because it takes into consideration all levels of fitness.    I have been working out 4-6 days a week for around twenty years.  I started out with the original \\"Firm\\" video, then included Step workouts, added running, Tae Bo, yoga, and then more pure strength workouts, like Cathe Fredrich's Muscle Max  (another 5 stars).  Just this year I added tennis.  I get bored VERY easily and never do the same workout more than once a week.  Basically, I cross-train.  I don't LOVE working out, but I've managed, with all the variety, to maintain the discipline to keep at it, do what works for me, and enjoy a healthy and fit lifestyle.      All this to say, \\"Shred\\" has been with me for about 18 months and levels 2 and 3 still manage to push me to a very satisfying place where I feel like I really worked out.  Again, I only do it once a week, but I do two levels each time, alternating:  1,2; 1,3; 2,3 on a three week rotation, and top the hour off with 20 minutes of Cathe Friedrich's Core.      This video is so deceptively tough.  The moves are so simple in their design, but require major work to keep up with them.  There is one move that I am STILL fighting to get to the finish without stopping.  What that means is that this workout is substantial enough to give you lots to grow into, yet at the same time gives a beginner a realistic starting point to feel like they are doing the workout on their own level and giving them a sense of ACHIEVEMENT in doing it.  It's a tough workout that is meant to be modified based on your current level.  But it is YOUR workout, and YOU have to be the one to push yourself up to the max you can do.      I, personally, love Jillian.  I actually think that the \\"smug\\" attitude some reviewers balk at is funny, because I take it as she is being a little self-ironic.  I am so glad she is not one of those teachers who is perky and dance-y and resembles a cheerleader.  (One reason I \\"left\\" The Firm 8 years ago - couldn't stand theStepford feeling of the instructors.)  I need instructors who sweat and grunt along with me.  She's realistic:  \\"See these abs.....you don't get these for free.\\"  She's empathetic:  \\"We're working the obliques.....we women can get these too with a little work, okay, maybe a lot of work!\\"  But most of all, while I'm huffing and puffing through high knees and grunting through rock stars, she's still talking!  LIke it's nothing.  She represents her own workout.  And I respect that.      The only thing that doesn't work for me is that the abs in levels 1 and 2 are not challenging enough for me; but that is why I started applauding this video for being appropriate for all levels of fitness.  For someone who is just starting to train their body, she doesn't try to impress by being too hard core and gives people a place to begin.  It's brilliant.      The only thing that would be better than this video is if I had Jillian, herself, in my workout room screaming at me like she does her team on TBL!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Obviously this isn't as good as the first ... but then, most movies aren't as good as The Boondock Saints. Troy Duffy made this movie for us, the Boondock fans. The MacManus brothers are just as powerful, just as air-punching, light-a-cig awesome as before, this time with a new sidekick, a spunky Mexican with a lot of heart, Romeo.  The Boondock Saints is a man's movie. There's no doubt about it. One of the things that made me anxious about ASD was the fact that there was a woman, Eunice, a Special Agent on the brothers' case. Julie Benz, however, did not disappoint.  Troy Duffy knows his stuff, and he knew what the fans wanted. The music performed by the Boondock Saints (Troy Duffy's band)was the cherry on top. This movie was everything I could have hoped for.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Jason Reitman's Up In The Air deftly balances a light comedic approach with the stark reality of today's down economic times.  George Clooney is at his confident & charming best as Ryan Bingham a hired corporate hatchet man who fires people for a living and spends about 320 a year on the road.  Ryan has created a bubble for himself where he has essentially shut himself off from any personal relationships including his family and has stripped himself of most of his possessions to those only of essence to his work existence.  He meets the sexy and smart Alex (Vera Farmiga) on one of his trips and they set His world is threatened to collapse when a young Ivy Leaguer, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) joins his company and pitches an idea to eliminate the need to go on the road by doing the firings over the internet.  Ryan balks at the idea and reluctantly takes Natalie on the road to show her the ropes.  Along the way Ryan starts to break out of his self-imposed cocoon and see that people and personal relationships are important.  Mr. Clooney, Ms. Farmiga and Ms. Kendrick all give Oscar worthy performances and the rest of the cast is equally appealing including Jason Bateman as Ryan & Natalie's somewhat sleazy boss and Danny McBride as Ryan's soon to be brother-in-law.  J.K. Simmons has a hilarious and poignant cameo as one the people Ryan & Natalie fire as does Zach Galifianakis in the opening scene as the first person we see Ryan fire.  Up In The Air is a movie set in the current economic times, but contains timeless performances that will make you laugh and maybe even bring a tear to your eye.

0091857023|5.0|I bought this book whilst pregnant with twins. When they arrived, the reality of caring for 2 newborns was quite overwhelming. This book saved my life though it is written for having one baby but you can still apply the methods easily for twins. I used it as more of a guide but, thanks to Tracy Hogg, my twins starting sleeping through the night for 12 hours once they were 4.5 months old! Her key is routine so if you prefer to feed-on-demand, this book isnt really for you. If you´re like me, and like to know what´s coming, then I really recommend getting this book.     She advocates a 3 hour routine of E.A.S.Y which is Eat, Activity, Sleep, You. This means the baby eats, plays for a little time, then goes to sleep and that means you get some ´you´ time. I started this method when my twins were just 2 weeks old and it didn´t take too long for them to settle into the routine. Sure, we had teething problems along the way and the routine would go out of the window, but it was easy to go back to it. As the babies got older, they knew what to expect and it made things easier for them and for us. I should also point out that I formula fed my twins so those of you who breastfeed will have a slightly different routine as babies who breastfeed tend to eat more often than formula fed babies.    On the down side, the author can come across as being a little condescending at times but when you´re dealing with a newborn, or newborns in my case, you´ll grab anything that may help!! Well worth the money!
0385528752|5.0|The idea of the elephant, the rider and the path is just phenomenal. Worth reading the book even if it is slightly repetitive. Don't expect breakthrough mind bending breakthrough ideas, but instead a lot of inspiration. I was surprised how things ended up resonating in decisions I make every day. Easy , quick read, hard to put down. Perfect for a cross country plane ride.
1423113497|5.0|I'm 18 years old and I must say this is a great book.  I, like most other older people who read this book, are big Harry Potter fans, hoping to fill that void.  This book will do the trick. (Also, on another note, this review will be comparing the two books, as Harry Potter is the main reason I bought this book).<br /><br />It's an easy read.  I'd say about 7th grade reading level at the most. And it doesn't take that long to finish.  I just read books 1-3 today and I jut got it about 8 hours ago.  I'm not waiting on the 4th and 5th in the mail (what a long 2 days it will be!!!).<br /><br />The book is definitely a more modern Harry Potter, even though Harry Potter was set around the same times.  I think the modern twist gives it a true spark.  It's fun because you can relate more the the characters.<br /><br />The characters are also well developed.  Perhaps not as much as Harry was by the 3rd book, but I think it's because we're only with Percy for short periods of times.  It's cool though because you're not missing too much in between those times, and Percy doesn't drastically change in between books.<br /><br />The other characters are kind of lacking as far as character development.  I'd say, for as much as we see Grover in the 1st book and you get attached, he's barely their in the 2nd.  The same for Tyson in the 2nd who was only mentioned in the 3rd book.<br /><br />Besides those flaws, this is a great adventure book for those who liked Harry Potter.  However, unlike Harry Potter which was developed for adults initially, this book is clearly for kids.  However, I think if you're a younger adult (16-29) you should enjoy this book!  I'm literally jittery for the next 2 books.
0061765236|5.0|I don't even know what to say, the book left me speechless.  I JUST finished it, and It was very good.  I felt like I was right there, and she makes Chris and Em so personal and so real!!  Thank you for this wonderful book.  I will remember it for a long time coming.  It affected me greatly because I have two teenagers as well...
0316113506|5.0|As a member of the \\"nerd-jock\\" club, I love this book. It takes recent research in exercise science and neurology and makes it very accessible and readable. I especially love how the book pulls you in with the real story of one school that took a chance and went against common wisdom to change their P.E. program and saw not just a huge improvement in student fitness levels, but also student academic test scores.<br /><br />I will be teaching P.E. for the first time this fall, and this book really inspired me to see what the real potential of healthy exercise habits are. I've always known the benefits of exercise on stress levels and general happiness, but I guess I radically underestimated the total potential. Regular exercise WILL make you smarter, happier and sexier. Now it's science. :)
1881273989|5.0|I was dubious about this book as I had heard many people speak about how The Five Love Languages had revolutionized their marriages and was unsure as to whether it would be applicable to me as a single.  This version of the book was something I could really relate to.  It describes how to approach other relationships (friends, family, co-workers, etc.) in your life as well as providing advice on loving that special someone when you do find your spouse.  And it did change my approach to my relationships.  I have become more \\"loving\\" towards others as a result due to a greater understanding of how different people need to be loved.  It has changed my relationship with my brother and with several of my friends.  It has also showed me why I often feel unloved by others and I can now work on ways to remedy that.  I highly recommend this book to everyone no matter who you are or who is in your life.  It will change your approach to others and as a result help you to experience a happier lifestyle.
0764207407|3.0|In the introduction to the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility Julie Klassen writes: \\"Jane Austen is more popular now than during her lifetime nearly two hundred years ago.\\" Earlier this week I went to Barnes & Noble. Sure enough, there was an end cap in the fiction section covered with retellings and sequels to Austen's beloved novels. Austen's influence can even be found in the popular paranormal genre; Mr. Darcy (Pride and Prejudice) and Jane Austen both appear as vampires in two such books. The Insight Edition offers a newly packaged look at the original story of Sense and Sensibility, with a few fun surprises in store.<br /><br />I'll be honest with you. Up until this week, Sense and Sensibility was the only Jane Austen novel I had not yet read. Without this new edition of the beloved classic, it's more than likely I never would have made it through. A few months ago, I attempted to read it from beginning to end, but gave up less than a third of the way into the story. I was baffled. If I can read Pride and Prejudice in two days flat, then why was I having so much trouble with Sense and Sensibility? Like in other novels, Austen writes about marrying for love and/or money, first impressions, and differences in class.<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility is the story of the Marianne and Elinor Dashwood. They are the late Mr. Dashwood's children from his second marriage. At the time of his death, he asks his son Henry to care for youngest three daughters and his new widow. However, Henry's wife has his ear and persuades him to give them less income annually than the promise he made to his father. Marianne and Elinor can only hope to preserve their future by making smart matches. Bold and romantic Marianne has her sights set on the charming Mr. Willoughby, and sensible and logical Elinor has fallen for Edward Ferrars. Neither gentleman is what he seems, and both girls soon suffer from a broken heart. The loss of Mr. Willoughby prolongs Marianne's sickness, and Elinor silently suffers through Edward's upcoming nuptials with Lucy Steele. Just as it seems all hope is lost for a happy ending, Marianne opens her heart to a new love, and Elinor learns that things are not exactly as they seem.<br /><br />This annotated edition of Sense and Sensibility enhanced a story I already knew through the 1995 Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson feature film. The editors provided trivia about the movie, ranked their favorite characters and least favorite characters, offered facts about Jane Austen and the Regency period, and provided definitions of difficult words. Whether Sense and Sensibility is an old favorite or a new-to-you text, this is the edition you should read. Lovingly put together by some of Austen's biggest fans, the Insight Edition will earn a slot on your bookshelf.<br /><br />*A copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*

B002G1YPH0|4.0|I gotta give it to CM. They made a low-priced cooler that has the potential to run with some of the best HDT coolers out there made by folks like OCZ and Xigmatek. The included fan is rubbish and starts having noticeable noise at around 1300RPM. It doesn't provide enough static pressure to push enough air so I took some Yate Loons I had, put them on in a push-pull configuration, and I've seen a 5 degree C drop in load temps (Q9550) from using just one fan. Mounting is easy and is screw-on so I'm no longer afraid that a pushpin is going to break and kill my video card.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Terrible. Laughable. Uncreative. Just like \\"Day After Tommorrow\\" where people are literally running away from the weather that is chasing them, these people are runnning away from water, earthquakes and rolling buildings. Laughable... just laughable. I can't believe people actually take this film serious.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This DVD is a definite must have for anyone, anywhere. It doesn't matter if you prefer comedy, drama or sci fi, Dr. Horrible (and company) has it all. And don't let the fact that it is done all in song scare you away, it's done so well that my friends who hate musicals with every fiber of their being LOVED it because the actors were all on top of their game, the plot grips your attention and because it was an hour of plain old fun. Even the special features are hilarious...and there's even a second commentary done in song--you'll laugh so hard, you'll cry. My only hope is that they do the long rumored sequel because something this good deserves awesome follow-up. Nathan Fillion and Neil Patrick Harris should do EVERYTHING together for the rest of their careers.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|This is it - final DVD collection for David Tennant in his role as the Doctor.  This 5 disc set is an excellent addition to the DVD library of Doctor Who fans that want some great extras - for example, David Tennant's Video Diary and Doctor Who Confidential.  Here in the USA, DW Confidential is not shown - so it was a great full version.  DVDs from prior seasons had smaller versions of DW Confidential - so it was great to see it all especially for a fan that did not have access to those.<br /><br />The quality of the DVDs was excellent and since I waited and did not plan on getting the individual DVDs figuring that a box set would be made - this is definitely a treat that I've been waiting for since the beginning of 2009.  All in all, David Tennant is a strong presence and a Doctor that sets the bar very high.<br /><br />Interestingly when I first saw these when they originally aired, some of the writing seemed strange - but the extras on this DVD really helped to see the logical reason within Doctor Who history to have these exist.  Not that I agreed with everything - but it was a fun ride and absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />This DVD set also marks a goodbye to many companions- including Donna Noble - my absolute favorite companion of all time!  All in all - this DVD set is about change and counting down until the regeneration and appearance of Doctor #11 Matt Smith.  Yeah, there are some big shoes to fill - definitely David will be missed.

B000A88EV4|5.0|...in its theme of drifter/womanizer, Naked however is altogether its own beast.  At once intriguing and appalling, in addition to some pretty memorable and f***** up main characters, there are a plethora of distinct minor characters that put in great performances as well.  I'm not sure what this movie said exactly, but you know fine work when you see it.  Part of what shocks so much are the ounces of truth that can be recognized in this darkness.  The other thing that shocks is the 'reality' these characters live in.  Taken as art and not reality, this is a 5 star movie.  Though there is reality in art, one should not be confused with the other.  Art is not a moral treatise, it simply says something that may resonate with the viewer, perhaps even bring understanding of something.  Or not.  This movie resonates either way.  It's pretty bleak, but it's a very interesting ride.
B000N3ST7K|3.0|Strangely absent from this soundtrack are the super cool, suspenseful italian songs: \\"Gangster Story\\" and \\"Italia A Mano Armata.\\"  I find this surprising and disappointing.  However, April March's sexy \\"Chick Habit\\" saved this otherwise mediocre soundtrack.
0765350386|5.0|I picked this up, largely having enjoyed Sanderson's work in continuing the Wheel of Time series, and wondering how he would do on his own, with characters, plot, and world of his own creation.  I was very pleased with what I read.  First, as others have said, he has created an interesting, inventive system of \\"magic\\" (if that's the right word) that doesn't come across as cliche in the slightest.  In many ways, the magical elements of this book replace what might be the swords n' armor elements of many other fantasy stories, as the magic is incredibly action driven.  This led to some very strong action sequences that really stood out.  I was also generally pleased with the plot and found the ending to be very strong and surprising in more ways than one.  All in all, a very enjoyable read, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This plays really nice on a HD wide screen tv.   I ran it on my sony 55\\" lcd and it was amazing.  Combine this with some nice bose speakers and you will feel like you are at the movies.  the movie was very fast moving and really captures the imagination.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|From the opening scene to the closing credits, this movie kept me spellbound on so many levels I can hardly wait to watch it again.  It made clear to me that the Japanese people are a beautiful people with wonderful traditions and ceremonies.  Each character in this movie was so perfectly cast I lost sight of the fact I was watching a movie.  I felt like a fly on the wall.  I loved this peek into their culture.
0143034901|5.0|If all contemporary writers were able to write this way - with wit, sense of humor, erudition and elegant style, maybe there wouldn't be a need for TV or movies. Yes, the book is that good for people who like smart literature.

Well, if you're looking for a movie that has it all, then look no farther...Legend of the Seeker has it all, plus more...great action, magic, teriffic sword fights, beautiful heroine who's just a tad different and a handsome hero whom I promise you'll fall in love with....Sigh...I'm still swooning...and, oh yeah, the surprises a long the way...? Yep, totally unexpected...
B001P9KR94|3.0|So I just sat down with Slumdog Millionaire for the first time.  Even if I adore the cinematic medium, I avoid the Academy Awards like the plague, and when that time came I decided to watch this film instead which happens to have won in 2009's major categories.  As the film came out, I was into the thick of travel, and moreover the film didn't seem to me like a good fit for Danny Boyle's style.  No less, it is one of those films about foreign poverty, with a grand conscience, and those can just turn out awful.  My perception is that, inevitably, people patronized (and then patronized) the film with work-righteous emotions fit for the occasion, and its distributors piled onto that package with the moniker that it was the \\"feel-good movie of the year.\\"  No thanks.<br /><br />But I watched it anyway, because it was just remastered onto Blu-Ray and I became an admirer of Danny Boyle's wild directorial style from his science fiction masterpiece Sunshine, which ranks with Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovsky's Solaris as perfected speculative fiction, lacking any mess of cowboys and indians in space with noises magically permeating vacuums.<br /><br />Something surprised me about Slumdog Millionaire, though I ultimately found it flawed from its failure to resist utter sappiness with a hyper-romantic disregard of reality (too many perfect coincidences; it might as well have tried to be a Greek drama about gods and fates).  The surprise for me was in its brash, stylistic disregard for the culture.  Boyle shot the film with agitated camera movements, super-wide-angle lenses (practically fish-eyed), avant-garde compositions, skewed framings, and so forth -- in other words, idiomatic to Boyle's modernist style.  Yet, if the original vision were that of the typical Birkenstock-armored documentarian (I am surrounded by them), all of these stylistic measures would be a violation.  It is in fact only at the end of the film (train station dancing sequence) where the Hindi cultural sensibility of Bollywood bridges the gap, and it becomes a merged work of cinema.<br /><br />And that is the whole point.  A Westerner visiting India arrives a Westerner and leaves a Westerner -- show me exceptions and I'll show you a skeptic.  The pretense of all filmmakers, composers, authors and visual artists who immerse themselves for the purpose of divining native art is perfectly inauthentic.  (Notably, my favorite living composer, Philip Glass, \\"invented\\" the last major movement in serious contemporary music -- Minimalism -- under the guidance of Ravi Shankar when tasked with transcribing microtonal indigenous ragas into Western notation.  Minimalism, and Glass's Minimalism, does not sound Indian, yet those Eastern fingerprints are all over the place.)<br /><br />It only increased my otherwise simple affection for the film when I surfed around a bit only to find significant mass criticism against it for failing (in one fell swoop?) to \\"capture\\" the spirit and the desolation of Mumbai.  I also find it comical as well as hypocritical that many are quite furious to know that the untrained child actors are still living amidst the depicted poverty.  Surely they can only be prosperous and happy in comparison to Western standards of heavyweight wealth!  And surely, snatching them from that \\"slumdog\\" environment will solve it all.ity of Bollywood bridges the gap, and it becomes a merged work of cinema.<br /><br />And that is the whole point.

014119247X|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

Excellent background on how Black Sabbath's sound evolved.  Many of the controversies in Ozzy's life were explained.  Very worth reading.
B002S0OBN2|3.0|Totally old finished.  Rehash of a song from the beautiful game or boys in the photograph is the title song.  The music seems like a collection of songs that he threw out from the original   PHANTOM.  You hear variations of ALL I ASK OF YOU, THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT etc.  They must have been taken from a recycled trash bin.  But they have amazing singers that one can overlook the shortcomings.  They are the most romantic voices around surrounded by a huge orchestral sound in the background.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love this movie. It was so good I want to the theater twice to see it. If you haven't seen it what are you waiting for? I'm happy sandra bullock won the award for best actress. This is a great family movie. I will be buying this as soon as it comes out and watching it as a family.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Gorillaz... wow. such an unexpected pleasure for me. Ever sense Del killed it in 2000 I've been a avid fan, and let me say, music as popular as this never takes over my cd rotation. To me its like Gorillaz are Jackson, Zeppelin, Nirvana etc. in their hayday, whether you're into mainstream or not, the sound is quality.    This album killed it for me right from the beginning. While driving home from the cd store the first four tracks left me grinning ear to ear. I have put Welcome To The World Of Plastic Beach and White Flag back to back again and again. Snoop is all style, he could spit nonsensical lyrics all day and it'll move you. The beat is addictive, I love Albarn's ability to keep that chill, full frontal gorillaz synth melody rolling, holding on to a high note transitioning from measure to measure. Its a perfect track for snoop, its got west coast written all over it, and Albarns got some affinity for west coast hip hop (Del) and chooses well where to utilize it.   White Flag is monstrous. I just love the fusion. It is so unique, so exotic, perfect to follow up snoop- both tracks describe this concept album, giving you a depth and conception right off the bat. I love the orchestra, but, I guess its just my taste, sometimes I skip the first minute just to hear Bashy and Kano rip it so hard on that island beat. It's almost the antithesis of Snoop, it's all about the clever tight lyrics, but Bashy's got this brash style reminiscent of Busta for me. He's just raw, cant say theres no style there. Kano completes the whole, lovely synthesis of style and lyricism from both Mc's, and again great juxtaposition with the beat and National Orchestra For Arabic Music. I love it.    Other highlights... well theres a ton. Actually 95% of the songs are worth listening to, for me an improvement from the last records (lookin at you Punk, Dare, White Light). I just think those songs in the Gorillaz catalog are less composed, or too upfront. They leave everything on the table right in front of your eyes, it's kinda boring. Stylo almost made it there in my book, but it certainly redeemed itself- its just too infective. Its like I love some of the other songs more, but I have to listen to Stylo just to hear that beat again. Mos Def, Albarn and Womack all make it a great listen. I thought it was a little predictable/standard at first, but theres enough there to keep me coming back.     I'd love to go through each song, which I literally could and explain every part I love or leave me wanting, but its just too much. 16 tracks people, its huge. I love it! Well worth the wait. ...but I can't exempt Some Kind of Nature with Lou Reed. This song is so beautiful. It grows on you, its got a combination of two complementary styles which I woulda thought could never happened. Lou Reed is so funny and eccentric, his plastic beach inspired lyrics are so interesting, and how he sings it is unreplicable.     Broken, Rhinestone Eyes, Plastic Beach, Empire Ants, To Binge and Pirate Jet I can't get enough of. Just gotta keep listening. The rest of the album is certainly listenable, and are quality songs. Superfast has De la leaving me wanting more lyrics, Melancholy Hill and Cloud of Unknowing are tight, but just haven't hit me yet. Sweepstakes is amazing, just in achieving that off beat eccentric sweepstakes characature with Mos Def, but its just so out there... very strange. Not bad.    The album is riddled with gems; rubies, emeralds, sapphire, anything you can find in the sand. Every song has its place in the concept, its really amazing. One thing I'd like to mention is my admiration for Albarn, how he can create basically 3 concept albums, with a completely concept band requiring a certain gorillaz trade mark in each song. This is INCREDIBLE. He's an amazing artist. He not only successfully created this band, but it's reached international acclaim, and the music is wonderful; thats the catch. Thanks for reading!

B002S0OBN2|3.0|I want to preface this review by saying I am an ALW fanboy.  I will see every show, buy every cast album and will try to find some reason to love even the weakest shows.    * MINUTE SPOILERS CONTAINED IN MY REVIEW BELOW *    This album reminds me very much of The Lady in White.  On my first listen to this album, I'm not in love.  The repetitive use of themes disappoints me as I feel cheated from hearing a full original show.  I know that Webber has it in him to write a complete original show, we've seen it so many times before.  As of late, it seems a lot of composers are writing in this style.  It doesn't provide a well rounded show.  It gives you a series of short stories that they tried to intertwine and just couldn't pull it off.  It's not attractive and I really wish they would stop writing like this.  It almost feels like each character is coming on stage to sing a few lines from their one song, leave and then come back later to sing you the next couple lines.  At no point did I feel like I was hearing a song complete in itself.  With previous ALW shows, you knew exactly when the song started and ended and each one was different.  I didn't get that here.  The sudden electric guitar in the Phantoms big number in act 1 is so out of place and so jarring that it takes away the believability of scene.  I really don't know what Webber was thinking when he decided it would be a good idea to throw that in.  The melody for Beautiful is the most haunting and well, for lack of a better word, beautiful pieces in the entire show.  ALW should have used this for the big number in act 1 instead of Beauty Underneath.    The lyrics leave much more to be desired.  Slaters style is not suited to something as theatrically big as this show should be.  His lyrics are choppy and often times don't fit with the melody.  He doesn't give us something we will walk away singing.  6 hours after finishing my first listen and I cannot remember a single verse.  The lyrics are far too complicated.  Harts lyrics for Phantom were simple, yet so emotionally provocative that you had no trouble remembering at least a part of one of the songs after seeing or listening to the show.  Even the lyrics for Love Never Dies have been changed so much and are so ill-suited for the music, that I won't walk away from the show singing this song.     There is a lot of anger running through the show and without actually seeing it performed, I have to say it makes me uncomfortable.  Giry is frightening in her anger and ambition.  There is never an explanation for this anger.  Giry is the only one with a French accent and it is so heavy that it seems incredibly out of place in this show.  Meg sounds like she was born in the Bronx.    Their choice of Ramin Kamiloo to play the Phantom only adds to my discomfort with this show.  The rest of the characters \\"sound\\" older.  The Phantom sounds at least 10 years younger than the rest of the cast.  And his voice is so \\"modern\\" that I just couldn't believe he was the phantom at all.  After watching the accompanying dvd, I am even less impressed with him in this role.  Crawford was believable because he had the vocal chops to pull off the sweeping numbers that Webber threw at him.  Kamiloos voice seems better suited to something like Zanadu or Wicked.    Sierra Boggess was a wonderful pick for the role of Christine.  She's emotional, instantly likable and has the vocal chops to pull off an aria.  Too bad she's never given the chance to actually act.    I tried to take a step back and view this as a standalone show, but without any explanation of the characters, it's impossible.  Even as a sequel, there's still very, very, very little explanation of the characters development in the ten years since the end of the previous story.  In fact, in the timeline, this story just doesn't fit.  The opening of Phantom of the Opera (at the auction) is supposed to take place in 1905.  Christine has passed on and everyone is still living in France.  This story opens in 1907.  Christine is still alive, half the lead characters have already moved to America and the other half arrive at the beginning of this story.  Where is a continuity director when you need one?  Ben Elton should be ashamed of himself for not actually reading the book for Phantom of the Opera before writing the book for this show.    Things I did enjoy about this album?  There are several and I will listen to this album many times as I'm sure there is a little gem hiding in it.  Overall, i rank this as one of ALW's least likable shows.
B001CWOCV8|5.0|The quality of music on this Blu-ray is amazing.  I played it for friends and family while I was cooking at my house and everybody loved it. I think they will be purchasing this Blu-Ray soon.  He sang all of my favorite songs.  Definitely a must buy.
B001FB5634|5.0|I almost fully agree when people say, \\"The book is always better than the movie.\\" but with 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthey, the movie really does it justice. I felt for once, the movie is just as good as the book and delivers the same grim feeling throughout the story along with the instensity of every moment. The acting was phenomonal and the movie's plot was laid out almost exactly like the book. I would give both the book and the movie, 5 stars
B002S0OBN2|2.0|The good:  I liked a couple of the songs on the cd.  It's similar to \\"Woman in White\\" where I liked several songs very much, but others were far less memorable.    SPOILERS.      The bad:  The book for this musical is ridiculous!  It moves from a grand, old opera house in Paris to...Coney Island?!? -- ten years later.  Raoul is a drunk and a gambler.  Meg is a psychopathic angry woman.  Ten years ago, Christine gave birth to the Phantom's child, not her husband's.  Oh, and the ending is ridiculous---SPOILER---Meg shots and kills Christine, and Christine's final words are to inform Gustav, her son, of his illegitimacy.      It ruins the charactes from the Phantom of the Opera -- and I am a fan of the first.  I wonder if ALW just wanted to \\"kill\\" off Sarah Brightman since he closedly associated her with Christine, and himself with the Phantom.  Lloyd Webber began \\"Love Never Dies\\" with entirely new characters, then later decided to change them to POTO characters.  The lack of character continuity screams that.  Commercially, this show makes sense, but he destroys something in the process.  Without the familiar characters, I don't think many theatre fans would have paid attention.
0307454541|1.0|I am 160 pages in at the moment, but just can't go any further.  Based on what's happened so far I should be about 30 pages in.  A boring, cliche-ridden book that creates no suspense and needs a good hard edit.  I get more excitement from reading Spot's First Walk with my daughter for the 100th time.

B000VDBD6Q|5.0|Anyone who passed by the Mystery section of the popular bookstores in the 70's & 80's saw this volume of Sherlock Holmes. Its prominent size and classic dust jacket stood out on the shelves like a bolder among pebbles. But for some reason I never bought the book. I guess I thought it would always be available. Then recently I got the itch to read the entire Sherlock Holmes series. The problem is that this book is no longer in print so, after reviewing the current available Holmes's offerings I decided to search for the \\"Old Standard\\" using Amazon's search service. So I purchased a good copy and it's like I found an old friend. True, there are no illustrations and the print is not particularly large (e.g. about this font size) but, the complete series is there and it's a joy to read. As far as I'm concerned, this volume of Sherlock Holmes is still the \\"Old Standard\\".

B000VWYJ86|5.0|Third in three great exciting action packed thrillers, Bourne Ultimatum takes off where Bourne Supremacy left us.<br /><br />Jason Bourne on a multiple quest to find who murdered the love of his life and the answer to whom he really is.  Now he has people in the 'Company' looking to finish him off as the last of his group of trained assassins.  There is a new group Blackbriar, supposedly better, with less of a chance of failure than Bourne's group Treadstone.<br /><br />David Strathairn, plays Noah Vosen, the director of Blackbrair, who decides he must eliminate Bourne at all costs.  He uses his assets to find and attempt to eliminate Bourne.  We are taken to Morocco, where he is in search of his CIA handler, who has more information for him.  Julia Stiles, an office assistant (Nicky Parsons, whom we have seen in all three movies) does an ample job of assisting Bourne as he flees his pursuers.<br /><br />One of the most interesting chase scenes of all time along the roof tops of Tangiers, even when we see the extras in the DVD and how it was done, wow, this is pretty cool stuff.  To see a man flying through the air from a roof top into a window is really amazing.  The fact that they actually did just that and how the camera work was done was edge of your seat stuff.<br /><br />This movie is definately a nail biter.  We are in London at the train station where Bourne and his new found friend, a reporter attempting to piece together information on Bourne and Blackbriar.  Then to Madrid Spain, then Tangiers, then NYC.  In NY, there is a great car chase and in the DVD bonus features you see where Damon trained to drive in that chase.<br /><br />Albert Finney does an excellent job as the trainer who we flash back to setting us up for a prequel if possible.  In the end, well, we have more to come it seems, so we will see where we go from here.<br /><br />The Jason Bourne series has so far been great action with a great plot.
0061849901|4.0|For those of us who think we've left the past behind and are terribly sophisticated...Pick this book up. Sylvia Plath is clearly more famous for poetry than prose, but this novel, written first person, is able to subtly place the reader squarely in the protagonist's shoes. The passage \\"the air of the bell jar wadded around me and I couldn't stir\\" illustrates the tactile feeling Plath's writing convey's and the sympathy it engenders in the reader. This novel also reminds us that 'the more things change the more they stay the same' in terms of social and mental health issues.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|First of all, I think the DVD had a few good extras in it.  You see a relatively long clip on how the movie is made and an alternative ending with a few deleted scenes.<br /><br />The film itself had some interesting special effects. Living in the Los Angeles area, it was fascinating seeing what is basically your whole world coming apart, again.  I think that is at least the fifth time in recent history including Independence Day, Terminator, The Day After Tomorrow, and of course in the past, The War of the Worlds.<br /><br />Interesting too was the reference to the earth shifting on its axis, and used to get them to a desination faster, okay, well....<br /><br />I did like Woody Harrelson playing a type of Harry Truman from Mt. Saint Helens fame wrapped up into an Art Bell type radio character.  Pretty funny stuff.  The scene of Yellow Stone getting whacked was interesting, makes you wonder if and when that does happen, what the result will be.<br /><br />One person mentioned the politicians getting rescued, let's not forget the very rich as well.  Makes you wonder, if there were a disaster at this scale, what would be the endeavor to save as many lives as possible?  What would our leaders do?<br /><br />I felt the story line took a couple of swings at England and Rome, not sure why they were singled out and seemingly made to look rediculous.<br /><br />For action and tempo, basically the movie was non stop.  Glad they deleted some of the scenes they did, and wish they had tweeked a character or two a little.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|I just got finished watching another video, an older video made in Mexico about John Reed and his work with the likes of Poncho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. The Title: \\"Reed: Insurgent Mexico.\\"  In this, Reed is constantly running toward or from battle, as he attempts to get a clear picture of the revolution.  The reason why I mention this, is that Warren Beatty as Reed, chases after the Red Army as it fights off a White Russian attack toward the end of Reds.<br /><br />Basically, Reds begins where Insurgent Mexico leaves off, so, a very interesting two movies, if you can find the above.<br /><br />You are left with few questions, if any, about John Reed regarding his views.  Whether the last scenes were true to the real story, John Reed tells one of the leaders of Propaganda that the revolution is dissent and a dissent voice must be allowed.  Throughout the movie there is the tug between the larger group dynamics versus the few having control of things.<br /><br />We meet John Reed after we meet who was to become his wife, Louise Bryant, played by Diane Keaton.  We see Maureen Stapleton, playing Emma Goldman.  (Fascinating to me how Maureen Stapleton never seemed to age.  She played Mama in Bye Bye Birdie over 18 years before and look very much the same.  Jack Nicholson plays the Irish American Eugene O'Niell.  He plays more of a pragmatic role juxtaposed to Reeds idealism.  Not to be left out is a very upbeat Gene Hackman, who plays a reporter who is really the opposite idealogically of Reed and his cohort.<br /><br />The fact that these people gave their time, life and effort to a cause that they really believed in.  These men and women spent ample time imprisoned in numerous places because of their quest for  what they felt was right.<br /><br />Additionally the movie is filmed in Russia (The USSR at the time) which was actually amazing due to the stories openness.  It has an epic feel at times, yet the invterviews from actual witnesses and acquiantences of the Reeds and their story, brings a much more personal feel.<br /><br />One scene is very telling, Reed is asked how is he supposed to do so much with so few.  He proceeds to ask a question about how many were involved in Revolutionary America with the first shot heard around the world.  He answers, 77.  So few were able to do so much.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with the ideology of Reed anyone looking for a view of unbending character in ideology, you get that in this story.ngs a much more personal feel.

B000071ZZI|5.0|Matt Damon really comes of age with The Bourne Identity.  A James Bond on Steroids like character that seems to have made the Bond series get more intense with the likes of Daniel Craig as Bond.<br /><br />There is definate passionate action here.  We see a man who is washed out at sea, with amnesia, wondering who he is and why.  Quickly he has an identity, yet too many in the form of multiple passports, and tons of cash, when he goes to a bank vault in Switzerland, that is the only form of information he has on him when he is rescued.  Things go from the darkness of not knowing who you are to a mad rush to escape seeming capture.  Not only that, he has all these amazing skills, martial arts, technical skills, ability to size up things where ever he goes.  What does it all mean?<br /><br />Additionally, as he escapes from one place where armed US Marines are chasing him, he happens along a young woman who is actually a drifter with no real place to go.  He has money, identification, but who is he, and he has an address, lets go there.  We flash back and forth from Bourne on the run and CIA headquarters, where his handlers are wondering where he had been for weeks, now he is run amok.<br /><br />Although a very violent movie from the perspective of fighting and shootings, the movie is simply not bloody or full of gore.  So, you can focus on the action and story, not the gore.  Clive Owen plays a very serious focused asset of the CIA. He is like Bourne, trained to kill.  He says very few words, and comes across as rather intense.<br /><br />Franka Potente does a great job of his unwitting accomplice who gets more and more afraid, yet intrigued as she finds herself a part of international intrigue.<br /><br />Damon, having played in a variety of less action type roles, really pulls off this one.  He still looks like a kid, yet his acting overrides his youthful look.<br /><br />The DVD has some great extras, you are taken behind the scenes with interviews of the actors as they do each part of the movie.<br /><br />More Bourne to come of course as this eventually works its way into a trilogy.More Bourne to come of course as this eventually works its way into a trilogy.

B000002HEM|5.0|This album turned me into a fan of 10,000 Maniacs.  Unfortunately this was their (to borrow someone else's phrase) Swan Song with this line up.  Not only do I enjoy listening to this album, but it is one of my \\"go to\\" albums when I want to hear how a stereo setup/loudspeaker performs.  Excellent recording by a very talented band.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater & have been waiting for it to come out on DVD so I could buy it. Not since The Bucket List & Second Hand Lions have I enjoyed a movie this much. In my opinion it was Sandra Bullock at her best alongside all of the other very talented actors in this movie.  As much as I love football, the morals & the storyline were what made me enjoy this movie so much. This is one to watch & enjoy over & over again!

B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Though my line may be contrary to the narrator's, this story IS a love story - just not what you're used to.  It's real.

B000006RHL|3.0|This CD was miscateogized as a double disc, but it was sent to me as a single disc. I guess it was due to confsion between the third party seller, and amazon itself. The problem was quickly solved. I recommend to everyone to e mail any seller to make sure you are getting what is advetised due to the fact that some sellers don't know about colletors items. Overall my dispte was settled right away and this seller was totally cool about it.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The complexity of a multitude of simple puzzles overlaid on the larger darker mystery, the versatility of Kristen Bell's acting and the strength of the cast makes this a series well worth watching.  One of my favourites.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I'm not sure how all of these top-notch actors were convinced into performing in this film, and so horribly.  Even Meryl Streep couldn't save this disaster of a movie.  It was overacted cheese, cheese, cheese from start to finish.  I like Abba, I like musicals, I love most of the cast in other films, but the best word to describe the whole production is embarrassing.  I blushed for Streep, Brosnan, and Firth, as they inexpertly belted tunes off-key with a melodramatic exaggeration I would expect to see from a child actor in a low budget Disney movie.  Who gave this director money?  Who edited this?  What producer didn't put their foot down when they saw the end result, and stop this movie from ever hitting the theaters?  This is definitely one of the worst five movies I have ever seen in my life.  I should have watched High School Musical 3 instead.  It was probably better.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset is ridiculously perfect, I bought two, one for backup of course. Headset takes a couple hours to break in since its been clamped together in that huge package. Anyway, In-line voice control makes it quite convenient to have and the mute/un-mute button can be seen right underneath/above it (Depends what way your looking at the voice control, usually if your looking it the right way it should be below the volume controls). The cables are quite durable, ran over them with my chair a few times and there has been nothing wrong with it. The mic slides up and down making it quite convenient if you feel like eating then just put the mic back up, the mic also extends outwards so you might need to give it a little pull since it doesn't directly go in front of your mouth. The black and red look nice together, engraved gamecon word (all caps) on both sides of the headset where you can extend the headset to your length of your head. The cushioning is quite comfy once the clamped-like feeling of the headset is broken and the cushioning covers the top of your head and the cushioning also goes around your ears, to create that Closed-Ear gaming effect. Mic response is nice, no static when I talk over vent or anything like that. The bass on this headset is good enough to satisfy anyone but it does lack bass so using speakers for your music would be more enjoyable. This headset can get quite loud enough to a point where I think my Logitech speakers are on (Of course not on full blast). The Closed Ear gaming effect is as the name states, you can hear footsteps from people moving, shooting, pulling grenades, hearing the grenades bounce, everything, perfect for gamers that utilize the sound effects of fps' and other games, you can also block out any annoyances that may be happening around your household with music. Nothing wrong with either of my headsets, work fine, ones backup if the other mic just starts to fail or die out, either way its a great headset and worth buying,did I mention it's NOT a USB port and takes up two spots but that doesn't really bother me. Overall its a 5/5 and I'll keep buying this headset if the backup and this one dies out OR if Plantronics somehow makes an even better headset. I suggest not wearing these in public, you'd look like an alien, pretty huge headset. Anyway, overall its a good headset and should suit any gamer. Again...5/5 :D.
B001TD1XWG|3.0|When i first listened to this album i wasn't too pleased with it. The only songs that really stood out were \\"Drop the World\\" and \\"Paradice\\" that was it. Listened to it a few more times and pretty soon i caught myself at work humming some of the songs i didn't even know i liked. As of right now i'm pretty pleased with it. My expectations were not to high for this album in the first place, but i was very curious to see what weezy could do with a guitar and some drums, overall i'm impressed. Noteworthy songs include \\"Paradice\\", \\"Drop the World\\", \\"Runnin\\", \\"On Fire\\" and \\"One Way Trip\\". The worst song on here is probably \\"The Price is Wrong\\" and its pretty bad. Definitley Give this album quite a few listens before you judge it.
B000002KFJ|5.0|The most under rated and the last great Black Sabbath album - with all due respect to Technical Ecstasy and NSD . Hole In the Sky , Symptom Of The Universe , Thrill Of It All / Supertzar and especially Megalomania are highlights of this great album . Megalomania is 9 minutes and 40 seconds worth of metal at it's best with it's haunting intro and killer guitar riff ..just a great album .

Emmerich is hardly the guy you'd expect to make a truly thoughtful movie about the Apocalypse, and you'd be quite right.

B002XMGGJM|4.0|This is a must-see action thriller that has an excellent story that dares to challenge the way we think about our legal system, but beware it is not intended for the squimish at heart considering its violent content (definately not one for the kids since rape, murder, and mutilation are all part of the package). I would agree with the other reviews, which in escence collectively agrees that this movie starts out strong in the beginning, but... it was almost as if they ran out of time towards the end and had to start chopping footage to get it all worked into their 2-hour package. I also felt it concluded to abruptly, elinating the big build-up that should have carried through from start to finish, hence the 4 Star rating as opposed to 5. Gerald Butler's performance was outstanding and he is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. As for Jamie Fox, this was a good transitioning role for him since once I got past that he was Jamie Fox (a nice reminder that it is still only a movie), I felt he was very believable in the role. In conclusion, it's definately a winner worth seeing for edge of your seat action/thriller
0312370849|3.0|What a great idea for a book!  I thought it was very well written and brought to light a tragic part of France's history.  I thought the characters were fairly well developed but the story really lost steam about 2/3 of the way through.  The last third was dull and predictable.  But overall, I enjoyed this sad, haunting story.  It will tug at your heartstrings, even if you figure out on your own how it will end.
0385341008|5.0|I'm a family physician,  and sometimes my patients recommend books for me to read.  Only once have they NAGGED me to read a book, and Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was that book.  I'm grateful to my patients for having been persistent.<br /><br />Let me pick the low-hanging fruit:  The writing is exceptionally good-humored, wickedly witty, deeply engaging, all without sinking into cloying sentimentality.  As historical fiction, it is rich and often surprising.<br /><br />What sets this book apart from all the other books that have the above qualities?  This, I think:  it is hard to think of a recent book that is so able to look brutality directly in the eye, yet maintain a determined and grounded optimism about human nature.  Some books push readers down into the cesspool of human depravity, and never let them up for air.  Others chirp away with relentless cheer, bubbling about making lemons into lemonade, and thoroughly convinced that you really can make a sow's ear into a silk purse.  Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society does not sidestep evil, but neither does it quail or moan before it.  It simply feels good, from time to time, to revel in the better aspects of human nature:  courage, integrity, humor, and the capacity to love. This book allows that, and does it with a surplus of dignity, as well as a dearth of sentimentality.<br /><br />Is this book the literary equivalent of a chic flick?  A qualified yes.  If you are so deeply masculine that you can't tolerate Pride and Prejudice or Austen's other masterpieces, maybe you should pick up a Clancy or Clancy/clone shoot 'em up, and read some guy stuff instead.  Me? Though a confirmed proud owner of a Y chromosome, I love Austen (and the Bronte sisters), and if all chick lit was like this novel (or Austen's, or the Bronte's), more than half my literary diet would consist of it.<br /><br />The letter format, in some books, can be annoying.  Not this one.  You won't even notice.  My patients....they were right.  \\"You gotta read this one\\" they said.  They were spot on.gotta read this one\\" they said.  They were spot on.
0812973992|2.0|This book was assigned for our most recent Book Club.  I was looking forward to reading it and started in a most positive frame of mind; but I found it boring and annoying and got tired. Of this kind. Of writing. With details. And more details.  That may.  Or may not. Be appropriate.  Or relevant.  For the story    I checked the Amazon reviews to see if ANYONE shared my opinion -- and was glad to discover that a few did.
1594488878|5.0|My first Hornby book. The characters were presented with such intelligence and humor, particularly the way the author was able to contrast Annie's view of Duncan with Duncan's own view of the world. Probably the introduction of Tucker Crowe was a bit of a disappointment, but, in retrospect, it was an excellent balance to the other two points of view in the book. The museaum metaphor that is woven into the book was thought provoking.    There was something quite compelling in the way that this book is written, it is thoroughly enjoyable, and I was sorry that it finally came to an end. I'm sure I will be reading another Hornby book soon.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|SPOILERS throughout!<br /><br />I don't know what movie the rest of these brain-fried people saw. I'm sure glad I watched the movie before reading their 3rd grade diatribes.<br /><br />This was one of the most excellent, thrilling, action-packed disaster movies I've ever seen. There's not a boring moment in the entire movie and has you on the edge of your seat every moment.<br /><br />It was a pleasure to finally see a disaster movie which is truly packed with disasters destroying the entire planet and every identifiable landmark instead of wasting time with ridiculous side stories. Most of the movie is through the viewpoint of global scientists, leaders and the struggle of one family to survive. I watched it for the disaster storyline, not their personal stories. When people complain about the lack of depth for the family, this is a disaster movie, not Sleepless in Seattle. If they had spent a lot of time on the personal issues of families, it would have ruined the movie and impeded the flow of suspense.<br /><br />I'm thankful they kept to the main core of the plot \\"The destruction of the Earth!\\" The entire movie was a fresh concept for global destruction. I was surprised to learn that these were not spaceships... although I think that would have been neat as well. However, it did not make as much sense for the two leaders which stayed behind, as it might have made if these had been interplanetary vehicles.<br /><br />While I understand the concept that no gov't would inform the population of such a cataclysmic event due to global panic and violence which would ensue from the very type of people who wrote those ridiculous critiques... many could have survived via ships or high altitudes if they had known planetary flooding was the main issue.<br /><br />You can also bet the wealthy, famous and chosen few would be the ones to get the seats. It isn't pretty, but unfortunately, realistic (as was the elimination of anyone who threatened to spill the beans). However, I doubt the escape ships would have all been in China. Each country would have had their own assembled at their respective black ops sites, under their control.<br /><br />It was obvious the person in charge of the plane flight scenes had no knowledge of aerodynamics or piloting. Planes simply cannot fly like that and would have stalled and crashed within minutes. However, it did not make it any less exciting. Having had about the same amount of flying skills, I did share Gordon's horrific predicament at being expected to fly a plane he had never trained for. That part was realistic but I doubt he would have managed that well under those conditions (not even in a simulator). However, it didn't dampen the excitement of the scenes.<br /><br />Same with the unbelievable driving escape scenes where no vehicle could survive the bizarre destruction sequences. Yet, no less exciting even though we knew it was over the top. We were still on the edge of our seats all the way.<br /><br />On the \\"divorced family being saved by the part time dad\\" issue... that has been overused from movies like Day after Tomorrow and War of the Worlds, so the theme is too repetitious as is the bratty kid routine which was also used in the Day the Earth Stood still. So, on this subject, these directors and writers do need to get away from these overused themes. In this film, would have opted to save Gordon in this scenario since he was the one who earned the family's love & respect.<br /><br />You can also bet that the cell phones and electricity would not be working and there would have been in a lot more global panic. However, our beloved media & political circus would have certainly been making jokes chastising everyone for making a big deal out of nothing (as depicted) while the planet was disintegrating beneath their feet. Have to keep the masses calm no matter what.<br /><br />The officials also seemed to be unreasonably blind as to what was occurring globally when they had access to hundreds of orbiting satellite systems. It took these survivors a month to find out that one of the continents had not flooded, (despite the supertech ops center they had?) As a director, I would have opted to flood all of the continents. I would not have left any landmass untouched because that really changed the dynamics.<br /><br />I would also have also opted for a simple discovery of the father alive on his ship & his rescue without the alternate ending discourse dialogue. Tsunami's are not as bad at sea as they are near a coast. At sea, they are swells, not waves, so it is likely large ships out at deep sea would have faired quite well. The film's research on realistic effects of cataclysmic occurrences was a bit thin.<br /><br />Opening the gates of the ships at the last moment was in poor judgment. If they had done so earlier, it would have been ok, but to wait until the tidal wave was on the way was most definitely not the smartest thing to do with humanity at stake.<br /><br />It would have been better with the President all the way to the end of the movie. The Secret Service would not have left him under any circumstances despite any protest he might have made. He would have never been out of their sight and they would have taken him by force if necessary to save him and the continuity of gov't. I think this should have been handled quite differently than it was. I did not agree with the fate of this character. He should have been a survivor and an inspiration to the survivors.<br /><br />Even with these improvements I would have opted for, I still loved the movie. It was a great disaster film!<br /><br />Don't listen to these brain-fried low brows that were probably dragged away from their favorite sports game and beer, etc., by their families and forced to watch the movie. Their lack of education and mentality is obvious just by reading their mindless attempts to attack the director and film to get revenge for missing their favorite TV sports; It was obvious just by the time of year and date this film was released. The reviews improved as soon as football season was over. That should tell you something about the hostility & validity of those holiday reviews.<br /><br />Think for yourself. If you enjoy action packed disaster movies, you will love this movie. It outdoes any disaster movie ever made. If you are looking for soapy relationships... then perhaps Sleepless in Seattle is a better choice for you. If you are looking for info on the Mayans & 2012... then you should look for documentaries with that info. But this is not for thin-skinned picayune whiners who are impossible to please.<br /><br />This movie is for people who love disaster and action movies. The scientific concept of this disaster is fresh and original. The director does a great job of destroying every famous landmark and anticipated trouble spot across the planet. You get to see California fall into the ocean; the Yellowstone Caldera in a magnificent explosion; Hawaii buried in lava; the Sistine Chapel crumbling into dust around the masses; the Las Vegas casino's disintegrating magnificently; the destruction of Brazil's landmarks; Washington DC in ruins; California skyscrapers crashing around their ears; incredible tsunami's miles high... covering every coast on the globe; continents tearing apart into horrific chasms taking everything of civilization down with it. You can't ask for more than this movie has to offer in disasters. A refreshing change from all those movies where they usually save civilization in the nick of time. Not this one. They utterly destroy it along with a majority of the population, in full realistic \\"top of the line\\" effects!<br /><br />This is by far the best disaster movie ever made with the most fantastic effects you could ever hope for. It is truly like riding the world's scariest roller coaster for almost 3 hours. You are on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. Not a boring moment. The tension is tight from start to finish and will twist you into knots without a chance to catch your breath. There are no pauses between the action and constant tension. The bigger the screen, the better you will appreciate the experience. This ultimate disaster movie is indeed all about the fantastic special effects. They did not scrimp on any of them.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed if you love disaster movies crammed with global destruction and special effects.

1573229725|4.0|Fingersmith begins in the seedy part of Victorian England with a \\"family\\" of petty thieves, or fingersmiths. Sue Trinder is a member of this family (and the narrator of the first part of the book). One day, a friend of the family, Gentleman, tells them of a plan he has to swindle a well off young woman of her inheritance, with the help of Sue. She is to play the role of a maid to this young woman and be the inside player in the game. As things progress and Sue gets to know Maude, Sue becomes less desirous of this swindle.<br /><br />Part two of this book is set at the manor house where the well off young woman (Maud) lives. She becomes the narrator at this time. We learn about her past and see the events that happened in part one from Maud's perspective. There is a HUGE twist that takes the reader into part three and an outcome that you will never see coming. This initially small scale swindle, takes on legs of its own and grows exponentially.<br /><br />It took me a very long time to read this book, but that had nothing to do with the quality of the writing or the story bring told. I was going to school at the time and there was very little free-reading time. When I was actually able to read, I devoured the pages. I hadn't read anything Victorian at that time and couldn't get enough of the descriptions of the world around them. The main characters of Maud, Sue, and Gentleman were expertly created and were wonderful, innocent, and malicious (in that order). Even the minor characters were well created and had distinct personalities of their own.<br /><br />I really loved the twist - I never saw it coming and it really took the book in a new direction - but it was very fitting and true to the story. I found myself connecting with the characters - feeling sad and angry and disappointed at times.
0143038419|4.0|So you are in your thirties, recently divorced and just out of a tumultuous rebound relationship ending in a crippling depression, the first thing you do is head abroad for a year, right? Sound a little crazy? Well that is just what Elizabeth Gilbert did, and she chronicles her journey in her spiritual memoir \\"Eat Pray Love: One Women's search for Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia.\\" The book was engaging and easy to read and enjoy. It is something that would be a great book to read on the beach. However it also ended up being quite superficial and hard to believe.    In the midst of her divorce Gilbert takes a journalism assignment in Indonesia that will prove to change her life forever. While in Bali she met Krueit Lieyer a ninth generation Balinese medicine man who told her minutes after meeting \\"You will come back her to Bali and live here and teach me English. And I will teach you everything I know\\" (28). She decided she would spend 4 months in Italy, India and Indonesia, specifically Bali.     After her divorce is finalized she heads first to Italy and rents an apartment in the City of Love, Rome. There is one stipulation of her trip that defies \\"the word of Rome, SEX\\" (103) she vows to be celibate for the trip. Instead of having sex she chooses to satisfy herself by eating decadent and fattening food. While the events of this section are believable the names of people are a little out there. She has a friend for example named Luca Spaghetti. The name seems a little too ironic to me.    I found the third of the book describing her time in Rome to be by far the most interesting. She spends her time eating, traveling, and learning Italian. However she did not dedicate time in this country to her spiritual and faith journey, which is of course the entire purpose of the book and her travels. The only serious part of this section was the process of overcoming loneliness and stopping her usage of anti depressants. Elizabeth is an over exaggerator of sorts, but her description of depression and loneliness is incredibly believable and the reader is able to really see how she is feeling. These are feelings that are easy to relate to.     The next part of the book was much duller. The events seemed unrealistic and the way in which it is written is hard to follow. While in India she spends her time at the Ashram of her Guru. Her Guru is her spiritual leader, yet she has seen her only once while she was speaking in New York. She is not in actual contact with her at all; the guru is traveling abroad and doesn't communicate with the students at the ashram. How can someone who you have never even had a conversation with guide you on how you should live your life? This path is completely about her spirituality and the journey she makes. She spends almost all of her time there meditating and trying to get closer to god.     This section was the least believable to me.  Some of the events just don't seem realistic.  At one point her roommate forgot and padlocks her into their room. She jumped out her window two stories to get to morning prayer on time, a prayer which she in fact hated and was always trying to avoid, and skipped on many occasions.      Bali came next and was also a more exciting part of her trip; however, it also showed Gilbert in an obnoxious way putting herself on a pedestal. While in Bali, Gilbert was able to show a balance between her spiritual journey and also her ability to enjoy herself in other ways.  She was able to study meditation, with the same medicine man from over two years earlier who told her she would return. He teaches her more about spirituality and happiness, telling her to just sit and smile while meditating (231).    At one point she got into an accident and scraped up her knee. The medicine man for some reason could not help her, so she had to find someone else who, surprise, became her best friend. This seems almost scripted to me; why wouldn't her friend who is a medicine man help her?She wants to make a point of how great a person she is with her donation to Wayan her new friend, and how she is trying to help her. Wayan is slow to be a house with the donated money so Gilbert lies and says she will take the money if a home is not bought, she then wants pity and reinforcement that she is doing the right thing and is not a bad person.     Elizabeth Gilbert's book chronicling a year of soul searching is clearly a spiritual memoir. The purpose of her trip was to become closer to God and to have a greater understanding of that voice that speaks to her. She seems to start off as a Christian but her spirituality takes many unconventional twists and turns in her path to \\"enlightenment.\\"    As this is a spiritual memoir of it is course all about Elizabeth Gilbert. Her writing however is a little to self absorbed for my taste. When she has conversations with people it is always about her and her problems, never the other person. This at times turned me off from Gilbert. I started out reading this book very excited. I was quite disappointed, while I like the book; I wanted to like it more. As someone who is only twenty and still in college it should be no surprise that I did not connect well with the book. Gilbert is not writing to the twenty-somethings, but rather to women in their thirties and older. I believe that if I was in that age group I would have enjoyed it more and been able to connect and relate to what she went through.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|great book. i read all of them. is the series ending? anyway scorpia is action packed exiting. the reader never knows whats going to happen next!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This is so much fun! if you love PG Wodehouse, Hugh Laurie, or anything British it doesn't get better than this!  Lot of light hearted, good clean fun and nonsense. What a perfect twit Bertie is, and Stephen Fry as Jeeves is superb. Lots of wonderful English locations, terrific casting and acting. I think you will enjoy it much more if you have read some of the books or short stories by Wodehouse, so you are in on the basic working mode of Jeeves, the power of the Aunts, and the cluelessness of Bertie.
B0035G9ABG|4.0|Well Plastic Beach has been unleashed on the world. whats my verdict?  I believe that Gorillaz has defiintely created an impressive album that will be heard for many years to come. For  hardcore Gorillaz fans, they are going to say that it is a masterpiece. For mainstream fans, i think what they were hoping for was another Demon Days. This is not the case. As most of you know, Damon Albarn decided to forgo having another producer on this album, unlike Gorillaz or Demon Days, which had Dan the Automater and Danger Mouse. The result is an interesting mix of songs that you would not expect of the Gorillaz. While this will turn off those who were expecting Demon Days 2, those who realize that this album is different will be taken on a musical adventure.  It feels like this album is a soundtrack to a movie that will never be made. Instead, gorillaz is content to let us imagine journying to the island. The mood is more upbeat that last album but the lyrics still have some dark undertones if carefully listened to. My favorites? On Melancoly hill, rhinestone eyes, empire ants, an and of course stylo. For mainstream fans, Stylo will be the closest to being a hit as feel good inc. In the end it is really up to you if you like change or not.  While I would have prefered more of  2D singing, this album is still great. Perhaps a P-sides is in order, no? Anyways, Welcome To the World Of the Plastic Beach.
158567057X|2.0|The language is very witty and entertaining. However the plots are thin, forced and ridiculous. The characters, especially the female ones, are not believable. Overall, pretty lame stories told in humorous language.
0140277447|4.0|I am not sure why, but for at least a year, I considered buying this book every time I was in the history section at the book store, but I never purchased it until recently. Lord, I had no idea what I was getting into. I have read dozens of books on all kinds of awful subjects like genocide, war and tragedy, but The Rape of Nanking was by far the most horrifying book I have ever read; it is not a book for the faint of heart. That said, the book is well-written, and engaging despite the sometimes disturbing subject matter. Most of all it is an extremely important book to read because it is a \\"lost\\" chapter of history. The Rape of Nanking needs to be remembered as much as any other failure of humanity.
B001U88814|2.0|I got a pair of these to wear as house slippers. The are very comfortable and appear to be made very well. I've had them for about a month and they still look new.    The bad thing is that after about 2 weeks of wearing they began to make a creaking sound every time I take a step. At first it wasn't very bad but as time has gone on it's only gotten louder. It has come to the point that I have to carry them and put them on out of the bedroom or I'll wake my wife up in the morning! I've taken the liner out and it's the back side of the liner rubbing against the rubber shoe.    I tried putting a shoe insole between the liner and the rubber shoe base. It helped quiet the sound about 50% but the sides and top of the liner still made a creaking/rubbing sound. Very annoying.    May try baby powder next.    Other than the noise these are perfect! Just need to invest in a pair of earplugs now.
1591843162|5.0|Seth is a great wordateer. His ability to provoke even the simplest worker into action astounds us all. By getting 1000 readers of his book to take a small action such as walking 30 feet far surpasses the achievement and contribution to society of one person climbing Mt. Everest (29,035 ft).<br /><br />I have already internalized and practiced his words long before they were published. So, reading his book has confirmed my need to find effective ways to become indispensible, i.e., a Linchpin. Once you learn how to break through the barriers after reading this book, you can do it again and again.<br /><br />Back in 2007, I and a colleague calmed our lizard brains, took action, and reached out to NASA to try to convince them with hard evidence that they needed more storage space on our glorious space station. At first they scoffed us, but after more than two years, the seeds we planted finally sprouted and they spent $30M to modify a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module on the last shuttle mission so it can be permanently attached to the space station as a stowage facility. Our small initial actions turned into a huge payoff for our customer. Today, NASA is taking storage space much more seriously than in the past. They are now concerned with collecting ideas to address the growing problem of trash removal from the space station. Rest assured and right or wrong, I will be fully fueled with ideas and an approach to an affordable and practical resolution to this growing problem, with no real fear of reprisals, especially now that this book is published and I can live these words.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I had to see this film because I am a huge fan of Keri Russell (Felicity) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. They don't share many scenes together but their connection and chemistry is awe-inspiring. Freddie Highmore who plays August Rush is such a special and gifted actor. This drama is hopeful, powerful, and deeply moving - I highly recommend it!

0312944926|2.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and I must admit that I have enjoyed all of them --except this one. In all of his books he makes historical, religious, or scientific blunders. His factual goofs show that he either has not done the research or does not care about what is true as long as it makes a good story. I can  accept the story-trumps-facts philosophy if the story is well written, if the facts are not too off the mark, and if the author writes skillfully enough that you understand that he is taking some liberties. Unfortunately, this book fails on all accounts. The story hinges on his \\"scientist's\\" assertion that neither of the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan were plutonium bombs. What!!?? Did he bother to consult a physicist, or nuclear engineer, or read about the history of the atomic bomb (e.g., \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\")? His statement that the \\"other atomic bomb\\" was a \\"different kind of uranium\\" (U-238 instead of U-235) is embarrassing.  I suspect that he read that the second atomic bomb was produced by irradiating U-238 to make the explosive. However, neutron bombardment of U-238  produces plutonium-239 and any residual uranium was removed. The second atomic bomb was most definitely a plutonium bomb.    Perhaps this goof affects me more than it would a non-scientist, but because this \\"fact\\" was so crucial to the story, I find this goof, among the many, unforgivable.

B002QEXN2K|1.0|I heard so much about how he writes great lyrics. But when I got my album and started to listen I got very dissapointed. There are barely any lyrics in his songs. Most of the songs is just a repeat of the chorus over and over.  The duet with Taylor Swift seemed pointless since you barely notice she was singing as well. Either let her voice be heard on the duet or don't do a duet at all.  Maybe he has made better album then this. But from only listing to this I have no clue why people think he is a great singer/song writer. I don't think he suck but he is nothing special either with this album.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|When it comes to science or half-way logical thinking, \\"2012\\" is a big joke. As a movie and entertainment though, it is another great offering that only Roland Emmerich can deliver. Personally, I never bought into the 2012 Apocalypse phenomenon, much like I came to reject the Y2K bug scare back in late 1999.<br /> The movie begins in 2009 where scientists discover a surge in solar activity. Back in L.A., a chauffer works for a Russian billionaire named Yuri Karpov, and is estranged from his wife and son and daughter.  In 2012, the sun unleashes solar mega-flares that are larger than any in recorded history and in addition to powerful flare-ups, unleashes enormous levels of neutrinos which interact with the Earth's core, causing the Mantle's temperature to soar by magnitudes causing the crust to undergo violent shifts and pole reversals. Yet, suddenly, perpetually violent earthquakes caused the Earth's crust to crumble and shift on a scale never before seen in human history and all must escape the crumbling Pacific Plate (Where L.A. lies on) and fly to China (Tibet to be exact) to get onto specially built structures that will serve as places where humanity will survive the coming Apocalypse.<br /> When it comes to acting or character development, none of the characters are really all that interesting other than the fact that they fight for survival into the post-apocalyptic post-2012 world. None of them really are all that significant other than the fact that John Cusack plays the primary protagonist. I DO however like how it makes the Earth as the primary antagonist.<br /><br /> In terms of special effects, \\"2012\\" excels in extreme mayhem and destruction as entire continents crumble, oceans shift, the core's temperature soars, magnetic pole reversals, cities being decimated in minutes,
B0000019PA|5.0|There are few albums that, upon a first listen, you know are destined to be classic, and In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is one of them.  I bought this album a good year or two ago after reading an article in Slate Magazine about Jeff Mangum, which described Aeroplane as a \\"musical curio so gloriously odd that it almost defies description.\\"  How true that is---bagpipes, horns, saws, highly distorted guitar riffs, with songs so various in sound that it's a mystery and a work of art that it weaves together as a whole, but weave it does into one of the most beautiful albums ever recorded.  Part Nirvana, part Beatles, part Dylan, Aerpolane is not like anything you've heard before.  Mangum's voice is so strong and pure in its emotion that you cannot help but be pulled in.  It rapidly became a contender for my all time favorite album, and I still try to introduce Aeroplane to anyone who might appreciate it, though it is true that Aeroplane is not for everyone.  There are those who are mad at Jeff Mangum for pulling a disappearing act after Aeroplane's release, but honestly, where could he have gone from here?  He and his fellow musicians cut a masterpiece with this one.....
B0030BYWKK|4.0|The Courage Of Others is a worthy follow-up to The Trials of Van Occupanther, the latter being quirkier in nature.  The 70s influences are still clear, but the songs are more polished, richer, and more complex.  Lyrically, it is more brooding, with references to a lost way of life more congruent with nature and the mourning for the destruction that erodes the possibility of a return that way of life.  When Smith sings in Acts of Man, \\"oh, let them go on, on with their own hidden ways\\" you feel the plea, yet it never comes across as corny.  Smith sings at another point on the album, \\"all I want is to be left to my own ways,\\" and you feel how simple that should be, yet how out of reach it is.  Midlake's vocal harmonies, which were strong on Van Occupanther, are even better here, buoyed by beautiful arrangements and rich texture.  Courage...does have one or two slightly dull, murky spots, which Van Occupanther's variety helped it avoid, so it falls short of five stars for me, but all in all this is a gorgeous album.  Midlake's talent is evident, and they are certainly one of the better bands to surface in recent years.
B00275EGWY|1.0|The Hurt Locker is one of the most tedious films I've seen in quite a while. It was simply a series of vignettes of a bomb disposal unit in \\"action\\", except there is no action, no tension, just mind-numbing repetition with rote dialog to match. The absence of character development did not bode well for the film as I didn't care about any of them. There was a blurb on the screen in the beginning to apparently explain \\"War is a Drug\\" or some such nonsense, then to connect the dots to that statement, near the end of the film there is a very small scene of Jeremy Renner's main character at home bored out his mind (he had apparently been forced to watch the days rushes for \\"The Hurt Locker\\"). This is what passes for entertainment these days. Absolutely worthless. The whole wretched affair gets one star for its director Kathryn Bigelow looking so fetching at age 58.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|I like a good Vampire tale, to be honest with you I am fanatic about Vampire anything.  So recently I decided to watch the first 2 movies of the Twilight Series and then read the books of the other two, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.  Because of all the bashing of Breaking Dawn, I decided to get it at the library(didnt want to waste my money).   Breaking Dawn didn't keep my attention as the other books.  I found, I kept skipping the pages to get back to stuff about Edward and Bella, which is what I  am interested in. The  non Bella /Edwards parts of the book , just didnt seem to do much for me. Overall I found the book 4 to be really for Teenagers and found most of it to be really hilarious.       The whole series is for the 14-17 yrs old really, because no adult experience reader could really take this kind of  writing  seriously. I dont see why an adult reader would bash the book.  It really is for the young , weired and naive.    It is not like Ms Meyer is in the class of  say a \\"Angela Knight\\".  Now her books are what movies should be made of!    Anyway stop bashing Breaking Dawn, its not necessary. I am hoping the painful , scary pregnancy and the paranormal  birth of the baby chapters, was scary enough to help prevent teenage pregnancy.      I must admit, I  was looking so forward to more mature juicy stuff between Edward and Bella since they got married and all and are both Vampires.  But alas, only  silly , weird, funny crap, that teenagers love.  Did I say the book was for Teenagers?    PJ
B001FB4VXU|5.0|What can I say?? It's episodes of the best comedy out there.  I've never bought and never wanted to buy seasons of tv shows, but I bought season 1 & 2 and will buy season 3 when it comes out.  I DVR this show now and keep the funniest episodes for when I need a good laugh.
B00004RJ74|5.0|One of the best vampire films. Clooney and Tarantino did a great job. Salma Hayek has a hot little dance number with a snake and i can't say anything bad about this film. Good fight scenes and good everything. I love the daughter of the main family. She's funny.
B002ZG98GO|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing. Shahrukh Khan and Kajol acted so well together, as always. If you love SRK, then you will love this movie. GREAT MOVIE, hands down.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|The disk is ok but only the movie disk works on my dvd.  The second disk does not work
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I had no idea who Edward Sharp was.  Tuesday is new release day on the radio station that I listened to.  When I heard the dj talk about Edward Sharp and The Magnetic Zeros, I couldn't believe it, so, of course I had to listen to this track called \\"Home\\".  Wow, for me it was love at first listen.  As soon as i got home I went to my Mac and got to Amazon.  When I found out that this album has been around for awhile and since I thought I's already bought every CD that came out in 2009, boy was i surprised.  Well you can't classify the music.  It's not rock, jazz, blues or doesn't sound like anything else.  So if you are up for something new and a little different, check out Edward Sharpe and Magnetic Zeros. I did and I haven't stop playing it yet.  It doesn't seem like they are trying to do something new and different, they just did, and we are the better for it. Right now you can download the whole album for just 5.99.  I don't think that that is going to last.  Word of mouth is going to spread and the price is going up so try it and buy It. Enjoy.
