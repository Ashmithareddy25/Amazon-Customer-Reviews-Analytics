B009G78EE2|4.0|Honestly, the CD surprised me and is much better than our live show experience...<br /><br />On a friend's whim, we went to see these chaps in concert in Denver, CO. The crowd was 90% disheveled teens so we didn't know what to expect... ML&RL ended up being ok live. Yes, just ok, but I've been to worse (i.e. their opening acts were a bit painful to sit through). A few ML&RL songs stood out.. obviously \\"Thrift Shop\\".  And few of the songs' lyrics did actually stick with me, which is something rare.<br /><br />I was going to buy only the Thrift Shop track since my girlfriend seemed to enjoy it and kept humming the tune over the following month. However, after previewing a few of the other tracks on the album I actually enjoyed recalling some of those lyrics so grabbed the whole thing.<br /><br />All in all, ML&RL have a unique sound and a few tracks will actually go into my playlist. As a whole, not my personal type of sit and listen album... but regardless I am enjoying them MUCH more than I had anticipated after the live show.<br /><br />Will keep an eye on these two moving forward, and honestly hope they don't fall into the one-hit abyss.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game, now in 5.0 wish there were buckets though, also for all you people who want multiplayer it dosnt. work. Try survival craft by candy Rufus game. its cheeper and has more stuff. I intend on playing thy till there are more updates for this. There's electricity buckets and copper plus more minerals not in minecraft pe. It also has a story line behind it and there are werewolfs in a full moon.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Never heard this group before, but grabbed due to popularity & price after few quick previews.<br /><br />Not sure yet if any of these songs will individually hit a playlist, but as an album to throw in and just let play this one works very well! At $3.99 there is zero complaint and it will definitely become a staple in my office background.<br /><br />Who knows, after some repetition a few of the tracks may stick out. Regardless, I think it rare anymore to find an album that is wonderful to play from beginning to end. (There's usually those 1,2, or 3 songs that just make a full play painful).<br /><br />At this price, I say purchase and never look back!
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|The whole family (including a 3 year old and 5 year old) enjoyed the movie.  The movie was imaginative and interesting.  Another fun Tim Burton movie!
B002ZG976U|3.0|It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. I'd still watch it again from time to time but I don't wish I owned it. I wouldn't buy this item again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game...I'm addicted to it! It's challenging and lots of fun at the same time. Plus the price is great!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|It's the fabulous Pride and Prejudice BBC (the only version worth mentioning) and it's BluRay better!! Now, while I say it's better it's Bluray and gives you what you'd expect bluray to give you, but it's also grainy. You have to understand the quality this film was recorded in and all of the highdef stuff we do to it can only bring out the imperfections of something. I think I still prefer the DVD version, but Pride and Prejudice, is Pride and Prejudice (the BBC version).
B00AAX68HG|5.0|so addicting! this game is fun and utilises the same notions of logic like cut the rope. definitely recommend to anyone who likes fun.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I really like all that was portrayed and how &#34;crazy&#34; Natalie Portman got in the character. I really like how dark and beautiful this movie it. I'd definitely purchase this movie again if I lost it!
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|This has to be her best album! This album has a perfect balance of &#34;pop/hip-hop&#34; beats. &#34;Unapologetic&#34; stands out for Rihanna.
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|maybe it's just me. how do I get the mouse to go to the button then back to the door? he gets a question mark over his head. I draw a line from the cheese to the button then to the door then to the cheese.
B005HWUCMC|5.0|If you are a fan of Rihanna, this album is perfect. All her tracks on this album have the &#34;pop&#34; sound, I love this record.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This big captures your imagination and keeps you enthralled throughout. Some interesting insights into religion - II thouroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend this book.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love this series!  I'm in love with Mac and Barrons!  One of these days, I hope to get some answers.....but until that day, I will just keep reading!  It's fun, funny, entertaining and exciting.  This author has a very good imagination and she keeps the pages turning.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am enjoying evernote very much! I enjoy not having to take my note paper every where, now I just review my notes on my phone, awesome! As I learn more of evernote the better I will understand how much it can do for me time wise.<br />Thanks
B0087HT36U|1.0|Paid version won't open at all on the S3. The free version from Playstore did.<br /><br />Game itself is very nice. I'm extremely dissapointed that it won't work with the paid version. PO'd actually. Going to contact the developer and try from there.<br /><br />I ain't got no time fo dat!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Be careful, Pinterest is just as addicting on your Kindle Fire as it is on your computer screen!! Good app though.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was non-stop suspense.  It kept me guessing the whole time.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Grisham.
0345803485|5.0|My husband and I are currently reading this book together. If you don't like graphic, definitely don't get this book!
B00004Y6NK|5.0|I just had to replace this remarkable piece of work from the &#34;cassette days&#34;. The awesome Eric Clapton of the 80's. Any fan of Slowhand will love it!!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I am 26 years old and this is still fun to me but my 4 year old really loves it!!!
B000SGRONM|1.0|I was hoping this would have been a funny Christmas tales and all I got was killing things... my disapointment
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is soooo addicting! I got it on my iphone first but when I started doing the 10x10's and higher, they got really hard to see and actually do without messing up the other lines. Its challenging but FUN!!!!!
0525952926|5.0|it was a good read he really did his homework on this one. it was hard to put it down.
B000YHG72E|5.0|If you want to see a really funny Christmas movie, watch Elf! Will Ferrell is hilarious! Good family laughs. I'd reccommend this to anyone
B0052RDHTM|5.0|it was funny how he brought all his characters together, I loved it and had to pass by the book for my husband to read
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Hilarious movie that my boys absolutely adore! Shipping was fast and it's got three separate disks that will work in a variety of devices.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Lots of romance. Loved the characters. Would have liked to read more of the happily ever after for the ending.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This a very good purchase that I do not regret buying! If you are considering getting this, don't wait, DO IT!
6302477751|5.0|Thank you so much for your quick service!  The DVD was just as you said it would be.  It was just as I remembered.  I'm really glad that you had this!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This a great show! If you are thinking about getting this show then don't wait! Just buy it because it's more than worth it!
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|After getting through a long period of rather dull set up, this book rewards you with a funny, romantic, light hearted diversion that is well worth reading.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is totally awesome.  It's a lot harder and required more consentration than the regular one.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mahjong.
B00274EYKY|4.0|I have watched this movie twice.  It is a good story line and the movie is well done.  I recommend it.
B009G78EE2|5.0|The Heist [Explicit] is a great album and I really enjoy it. Thrift Shop by far is my favorite song on the album. The songs were very easy to download through the amazon download program. Only thing that could be better is if I didn't have to download a program to download the music. Fortunate enough the music download quickly and was easy to just move the folder of the album and move it to another folder.
0143120530|4.0|If you think you have a bad memory, this book will help.  It explains what memory is and how to remember things better.  It is also a good story.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Draws you in (no pun intended). Game rewards exploration. A few small glitches and quirks, but does not interfere with game-play.
0425263908|5.0|Crazy good book. Similar to 50 shades but sexier with a better plot. Hot and steamy!  I'm so happy Sylvia Day made these into a triliogy!
1939416019|5.0|As I read some of the very nasty remarks some of you idiots posted regarding spelling errors just to name one, you're right, there were some errors but who among you are writers?  Especially one as awesome as Morgan Rice.  I have read EVERYONE of them and can hardly wait until the next one comes out.  Some even said it was childish, that most teenagers would mnot read it.  Guess what?  If my Lord & Savior allow me to live until April 29th, I will be a proud 60 year old female.  So all of you naysayers, GET A LIFE and become a writer if you can do better because you're right, Morgan isn't perfect, Nora Roberts, John Grisham, Danielle Steel, me nor you are.
0425263916|5.0|This book is similar to 50 shades but so much more sexier. I'm in love with these two books can't wait for the next installment!
B009I0QTF8|5.0|This album is not for the weak at heart or inexperienced. It requires you to be present, aware, full of life, hope, dreams, and passion. The beauty is that there is light and dark in this record. So it caters to your Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde selves. It's a thing of beauty in the most intense way, but will also give you that (black magic woman) when you need her! Yes....NEED HER!
B000001FI7|5.0|It's greatful!!! One of the greatest trip-hop albums of all times!!! And this is REAL TRIP-HOP!!! Beth is very charizmic, like always))). Sound quality is super - first press is always cool!!!))) Thank You Amazon for this diamond!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was an amazing book, could not put it down.<br />Kept me interested throughout all of his letters.<br />It was perfect.
B005R4255C|5.0|Well, what I can say... Michael is a KING OF POP!!! And He is IMMORTAL!!!!!!!! Great Edition for a true MJJ fans!!! Beautiful booklet and perfect quality of sound!!!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is a great movie.  I am please to have bought it.  It was well worth the inexpensive price.  It is a very good buy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I think everybody should read this book it is the best book ever! There are no thinks I dislike in this amazing book. Truly amazing.
1400069289|5.0|Just got this in the mail today, so haven't read it yet, but can't wait to dive into it and see what all the fuss is about!
B0031RS42K|5.0|Thrilling and as soon as I thought I knew what was going to happen there was a great twist.<br /><br />Will recommend this book to everyone I know.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I use MoboPlayer on my BN Nook tablet, which is rooted and currently running CM7 Android.  Mostly, I use it to play courses purchased from The Learning Company which come as VOB files.  It does an excellent job of this for the most part and I continue to use it because it's the only player I know for certain can handle this file type.<br /><br />But there are two problems I note with it.  First, it drops the last ten seconds or so of every file.  This is mostly just a little disconcerting; not much happens in the last ten seconds anyway.  The second is more troubling. Many of the lessons span two files, with the second file containing as much as several minutes of the lesson.  MoboPlayer doesn't chain the files together and doesn't display video or audio if the second file is selected manually, although the progress bar runs for the full length of the file.  I know the second file is playable, since it plays in MoviePlayer on my Ubuntu Linux system, either individually selected or chained. This is the reason I only give MoboPlayer four stars.<br /><br />I should note that The Learning Company is beginning to provide courses in an AVI format and these courses display with no problems.  MoboPlayer also handles many other file types, but I haven't had occasion to try any of them.
1449415881|5.0|Dilbert et al always amuses with poignant scenarios that are all too close to the real world.  Rarely is there a comic that does not relate to my past dealings with &#34;induhviduals&#34; or provide insight to current dealings.
0345509617|5.0|This book, an account of my personal favorite movie of all time, is more than any fan could ask for.  There is almost an entire chapter just explaining the decision to have Han Solo say &#34;I know&#34; before being put into the carbon freezing chamber.  Incredible, and incredibly detailed.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|While this game is very neat and innovative in a lot of way I found the gameplay somewhat repetative, and stress inducing! The graphics are beautiful and the interface is top notch, and while usually on my kindle I play games with the sound off, I enjoyed the music so much, I found myself pluggin in the headphones whenever I wanted to play it. All this is great and all, but unfortunately this game was not the &#34;Chill out&#34; game for me the way others found it. As soon as I passed the initial levels and the difficulty amped up, I found the slow pace of the game, (or fast pace if you sped up the time) stressful. Ultimately much of the game is a race. Collect all the pieces and get big enough before you get eaten, or before the others get bigger than you!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This box set is exactly what any fan of the Christopher Nolan &#34;Dark Knight&#34; trilogy wants - not many bells and whistles, but the price for what is included is excellent.
B0001I561E|5.0|I am very pleased with this item.  I seem to have lost my original copy & was thrilled I was able to replace it with the better version.
B00000F214|5.0|A great movie with one of the most famous ending ever - do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A Dance with Dragons was markedly better than A Feast For Crows. I felt that Book 4 was all over the place and I was a bit worried about where the series was going after finishing Book 4. There is still a lot of bouncing around in Book 5, but Martin did a good job of keeping his story lines fairly clear. This was something that I found lacking in Book 4. I feel that he is falling into the same trappings that Robert Jordan fell into with his Wheel of Time series. There are too many characters and there's almost too much going on to keep track of, but to me, that spells out a great series and it means that there will be many more books in this series to enjoy.<br /><br />The plot lines that I am most looking forward to in the next book are: Arya, Tyrion, Cersei, Daenarys, and Jamie and Brienne.<br /><br />Martin is great at delivering shocking twists in his plot lines, and Book 5 proves to be no exception. Those twists all happened at the end of the book, but I suppose that is the point. I'm definitely more than ready to the next book in the series.
0345505387|1.0|Unfair for me to review this book as I returned it to the Bookstore.  It was not what I expected.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|This is absolutely touching and inspiring. I never have read a better book in my whole life. Read it right now!
0425263908|5.0|Full of emotional torment, scorching love scenes, and a gripping storyline. Gideon Cross came is lightning in the darkness… He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot.
0307744434|5.0|I joined a book club and this was the book that we were reading. I was not familiar with this book before I purchased it. It is a good read, although I did not finish it. I am not too keen on the topics that were discussed in this book, but it is very entertaining.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I am in love with Downton Abbey because I watched this movie years ago and didn't want it to end. Juliann Fellows is a part of both the movie and the series.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy to watch again and again, and funny to hear in the background if you're doing stuff aorund the house. Lots of one liners.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book and it was hard to put the book down before finishing. The story was fantastic and exciting.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|its very fun and entertaing... its keeps your mind busy and it leaves you guessing and wanting more clues as to what happened and who done it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I Enjoy playing this both on my kindle and on my android phone while I am feeding my baby and while travelling
0385336950|3.0|It's not bad, but not what I was looking for. I wanted the book the movie was made from- David Mitchell
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The game was purchased as a gift & the recipient loved it.  Price was much lower than in any local stores.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We just happened to see the show which had most of the actors and dir talking about how it all became and wht happened to it, So it was great to find this one...
B005KISHDY|5.0|This was my grandsons most wished for Christmas present from Grandma. He was thrilled to get it. He loves all things Legos, and is really into Star Wars now. He's only 9, so this was a good father/son project.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I loaded this app on a dual boot HP Touch pad. My husband and I really enjoy listening to the Christian instrumental stations. This app works great with no complaints so far.
1250027624|5.0|Best Gift So I Was Told at least that is what my friends mother said. I bought it as a gift for her at Christmas She loved the series and getting an 83 year old a gift is not easy. I better start thinking about next year........
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not your ordinary &#34;who-dunnit&#34; of a missing person.  Great plot and a fun read.  I definitely recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a mystery with an unexpected storyline.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A great rendition of a classic game. The game comes with a variety of puzzle configurations changes on completion of each individual challenge.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Simple soft and easy to listen to. Doesn't go over the top like Mariah Carey. Makes an excellent Christmas gift
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I seriously loved this book read it in two days :) trust me you won't put it down its that good
B007FEFLTO|4.0|But a bit contrived.  I felt the author created secondary  characters at the last minute to bring the readers attention to  highlights of the war without actually writing a war story.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|This production is so awesome we can't stop watching it over and over. It is one of the finest vocal performances I have ever seen.
1400082773|5.0|This book arrived quickly and in wonderful condition.<br />It made me respect and admire our President even more than before.<br />This man really went through a turbulent childhood and came out a terrific human being because of it.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|The movie's dialogue is full of non sequiturs and difficult to follow.  Don't think I'll bother with reading the book to try and understand the movie now as I'd have to fight drowsiness before I finished the first page...but then again since I'm having trouble sleeping it may be just what the doctor ordered.  I can appreciate the concept though and if you like that kind of brilliance, it delivers.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great book!  Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next book that follows.  Easy & light reading! Not in libraries!
0803731094|5.0|I wrote a paper interpreting this as a Marxist text, though I don't think that's what the average reader will get out of it. It's charming, clever, and sweet, like most children's books, and after I was done writing about it I gave it to my wife's class' library.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|great album check it out.the sound quality is very nice and this group will go very far in the music business.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|It's the &#34;young kid with a lot of potential&#34; story. Grows up, gets tremendously good (though not at everything, which is an effort I'll grand to the author), a leader among friends, a standard of virtue, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Then... why is it so good ? Because it's very well written, because the sorty unfold and captures you despite being so classic, because I so much like stories of schools and academies and youngster growing up into one (Wheel of Time with those Aes Sedai, or Harry Potter like). If you like kid stories, schoolyard stories, and future hero stories, you'll probably love this book as much as I did !
B000005RS0|5.0|yes just like Tina said when she was interviewed,this is my baby.the album reflects her coming out on her own and tells of the past struggles.this is a CD where every song on the album was a hit that was palyed all over the radio.great CD I recommend getting it today.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the book. Being a man and being genuinely interested in special forces, this book sheds some light on one of the most elite groups of fighters out there proudly putting in the necessary dirty work to keep our country safe from some the darkest scum on the planet. This book gives an account of the training and operations carried out by a seal team six operator and some of his team mates during his lengthy career culminating in the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|The story line is predictable and boring.  The character played by Tommy Lee Jones is simply not believable.  While the movie was not so bad that we turned it off, it was bad enough that we were constantly considering it.
1449415881|5.0|very pleased. I could not find this in my local storees and christmas was close. came in time.. all was fine
B008M721MS|5.0|Skype works amazingly on the kindle. Clearer and obviously visually larger than the ipod or iphone and the connections as good as the laptop.  Works for my transatlantic connections.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm so excited for the next book. This was a great book and I would recommend it to everyone. Wonderful!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really love this game it is fun to play and I think it is great for all ages. It is an awesome game
B007THA4FI|2.0|I should have read more about this book before choosing it.  I haven't finished it yet so it may get better.  I don't like some of the off color language.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I feel Sparks might have stepped outside his comfort zone writing this and I certainly did reading it. It was not subtly written and very uncomfortable at times.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like that diary of a wimpy kid is friendly to kids of all ages and for boys and girls. it has a sense of humor .
B004RCUJ9E|1.0|I've read previous reviews about this game freezing pieces in place, not allowing jumps, won't jump, or allowing (directing) only one move when a piece has more than one option.  Unfortunately all the reviews that mentioned the above are true though I hardly expected them to all happen in the very first game that I played!!!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Well-written, thoughtful, and revealing look at the influence of a long forgotten author.  Among the best books that I have read in several years.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|My 3 and 5yr old kids love it.  They quote the funny lines from the movie and were tickled pink by the fish.  It arrived quicker than I thought are in perfect condition.  Very satisfied!
B000AS4L16|5.0|If you are a serious student of the Holocaust, this is essential viewing.  I have seen it at least 4 times and feel I have yet to extract all I can from it.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|Chris is from Louisville, Ky, the home of bluegrass, but he writes like Dylan.  He sings his own stuff and it is great.  You will not be sad to make this purchase.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Made me think<br />Loved the research backed findings<br />Plan to read more by these writers and the books they referenced.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining! I find myself not being able to stop playing ! Love it! This game is great for all ages!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Robert and Minnie are the hero and heroine of this beautifully written novel by Courtney Milan.  But they are also the protagonists: battling injustice against factory workers, women, and the abusive actions of their own dysfunctional pasts and families to do the right thing.  If I have one bone to pick about this book - it's the title.  The Duchess War doesn't fit the story.  Robert is a Duke with the sensibilities of a revolutionary.  He is the son of the philandering, raping duke in The Governess Affair.  Robert is constantly trying to make up for his family's inadequacies and the total blindness of the aristocracy to the fate of the poor, working class.  He encourages unions and wants to completely abolish the aristocracy.  Minnie is the daughter of a man who used her talent at chess to gain international recognition for himself.  She is constantly living down and hiding her past going so far as to change her name.  Robert and Minnie clash when he writes an incendiary pamphlet using a chess strategy:  a strategy Minnie shared with him thereby potentially exposing her past.<br /><br />The secondary characters also have their own stories in later books and I look forward to reading them all.  If you are looking for rakes and the wallflowers who reform them, this book is not for you.
B000W9MMPU|1.0|You should make sure you sell something worth selling. The only one of the three I like and it's the broken one.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|Actually I did not make a complete test yet. So far worked perfectly on wood mode. Seems to me that is a great product.
0345803485|5.0|love love love this book. and love love love that it arrived quickly for my flight the following week!  made for excellent passing of time ...
1934030554|5.0|I am only about 60 pages in and I have already learned so much about the value of training with power. I particularly appreciate the tables that allow you to self-identify your capabilities based on power levels at different intervals and understand where your strengths are before targeted training.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|If you like the hunger games, you'll love this,  Fast read and easy read.  It keeps your interest.  Highly recommended
B008L1DNGI|5.0|When I first got my Gameboy Advance many years ago, I bought a copy of ChuChu Rocket to go along with it. It was a ridiculously good deal at the time, so I gave it a try. I never expected to get sucked into it the way I did - and I ended up spending hours playing it until I'd mastered all the levels.<br /><br />Well, this Android version of the game is just as good as the GBA version I played years ago. In fact, I'd say the touch capabilities make it much better. Here's a great example of an excellent puzzle/arcade game updated into the twenty-first century with wonderful results. I hope more classic games follow their lead!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|A friend recommended this movie to me.  It's a great story of struggling times of the 1930s.  Very well done.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The research was pretty good for the book but some of the story is a bit exaggerated, even for a fictional Grisham story.  But it was a good plot and fast read.  Exciting twists and turns.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Yes, she made me cry. It was a very good book. I liked it as good as the Twilight Series.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|I must agree with most reviewers here is that this game is cute indeed and graphics and controls work very well for an entertaining game for kids. It was installed on Kindle fire and worked beautifully.<br /><br />I played few levels for me to understand and get a feel of it. From the looks it is obvious that it was designed for kids in mind with simple obstacles to overcome and get rewarded with points. Love the Animation and the mouse character is adorable. The levels do get harder as you progress in the game especially after level 6 and above so watch out kids!. The game-play requires you to think in reverse logic how to overcome the obstacles and draw lines for the mouse to follow the trail and get to the cheese. - Nicely done!<br /><br />For a free app of the day it is definitely a keeper and properly priced at $1 coming later.<br /><br />Cheers!
0525423656|3.0|Crossed definitely suffers from middle book syndrome.  Nothing super exciting happens and no questions are answered.  But it gets you to where you need to be for the conclusion, Reached.<br />Although it was slow most of the way through, it was still worth it to then be able to read Reached, which was much better.
034580404X|5.0|You can definitely see similarities to the Twilight series but I really loved these books. Couldn't put it down from page 1. Nice plot line with some action and drama mixed in the romance.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|I didn't klnow much about this movie but liked the sound of it and the cast line up. It's adorable!! My son and I have watched it multiple time!! highly recommended!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I'm not going to review the content of the DVD because it is excellent and deserves 10 stars. Or maybe 9 since they stuck Nick Jonas in there. :-P  Though I will note that this is the same Les Miserables concert that was aired on PBS a while back. It is not a full length production, but a CONCERT. So music and songs only, not scenes. But in all fairness, it didn't need to be longer than 2 and a half hours anyway. I just needed to watch this and hear the beautiful music again in order to erase the memory of the terrible caterwauling in the new movie. This is how it sounds when it's sung well.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this product 4/5 because the DVD does not have any kind of credits or chapter listings inside the box. All I received was the DVD case (as pictured) with the DVD inside. There was no info about the product or show at all: no cast list, music credits, and etc. I thought that was a little ghetto. But I enjoyed the DVD none the less.

B00AS1Q93S|3.0|The movie \\"Jack Reacher\\" begins with a seemingly random sniper attack that kills five innocent victims.  In record time, the police investigation rounds up a disturbed former Army veteran, who just happens to be a trained sniper.  Under questioning by the police, he asks them to \\"call Jack Reacher.\\"  Reacher (Tom Cruise) turns out to be a former military policemen who has gone off the grid and into the private justice business.  He agrees to help the attorney defending the veteran, and quickly determines that what looks to be an open-and-shut case looks a lot more like a clever frame-up.  Whoever is behind the frameup reacts badly to Reacher's involvement in the case, sending a group of thugs to scare him off.  Reacher doesn't scare so good.  He does find himself up against a ruthless conspiracy with a connection to the Russian mob and an insider within the investigation.<br /><br />The air of paranoia around the case only gets thicker as Reacher continues his investigation his way, beating up bad guys, conducting high speed car chases and dodging shooters.  He will get help in the form of a retired Marine (neat cameo by Robert Duval).  Reacher acts as if he has nothing to lose, which may be his only edge in a final confrontation with the bad guys, with everything at stake.<br /><br />Fans of Tom Cruise's action movie should enjoy another action flick; hardcore fans of the Jack Reacher novels may not.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I just ove this series we are totally addicted to this show! Can't wait for the third season to be released.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven was both interesting and surprisingly suspenseful; I always looked forward to picking it up and continuing my reading. The author is an impeccably educated and highly respected neurosurgeon who had been adopted and followed in the professional footsteps of his adoptive father; had been an experienced shy diver in college; married and had children; longed to meet his birth family and finally did; somehow contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis; and while moving toward death in a coma, claims to have gone to heaven where he met God, an angel, and had other unquestionably (for him) heavenly experiences that he lived to share with others, asserting that collectively they represent \\"the single most real experience of my life.\\"  A fascinating and gripping story!--but that said, it's time to take a close look at the author's claim, namely, that there is \\"Heaven\\" after death, or more generically, that consciousness survives death.<br /><br />I think it not unreasonable--indeed, fundamental--to require of someone who insists his or her experience proves consciousness survives bodily death both to have died and subsequently to have returned to life sometime prior to making such an assertion. Any claim to have experienced death and to know what occurs after it without having first died would seem absurd on its very face. Indeed, initially Alexander claims to have died: \\"My experience showed me that the death of the body and the brain are not the end of consciousness, that human experience continues beyond the grave.\\" (I think it premature to claim having experienced \\"death of the body\\" if one's respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems are functioning, and only the nervous system is damaged--however severely.) So, I could only shake my head in wonderment when he claimed later not to have died but to have had a NEAR death experience (NDE). Throughout, he refers to his experience as an NDE and compares the experiences of other NDE survivors to his own,noting--until nearly the end of his book--that his NDE was similar to those recounted by other NDE survivors save their meeting deceased relatives and reviewing their life's good and bad actions: \\"I experienced none of these events, and taken all together they demonstrate the single most unusual aspect of my NDE.\\" Then, in a patently self-contradictory statement, he writes, \\"At the risk of oversimplifying, I was allowed to die harder, and travel deeper, than almost all NDE subjects before me.\\" With a sentence like that, I don't think he need worry about oversimplifying.<br /><br /> So, we have an author claiming to know what happens to consciousness after death based on his own experience of death even though he repeatedly admits that he had not died at any time prior to his claim. For me, this turns his assertion of having entered the foyer of heavenly life into evidence that, at most, he had arrived only at the derriere of his earthly life.<br /><br />My second quandary is the medium responsible for his right to claim he was in heaven, namely, sensing and feeling: While in what he calls the \\"Realm of the Earthworm's-Eye View,\\" he notes, \\"...gradually this sense of deep, timeless, boundaryless immersion gave way to something else: a feeling like I wasn't really part of this subterranean world at all, but trapped in it.\\" A little further down, he writes, \\"I heard an occasional dull roar,\\" and, \\"the movement round me became less visual and more tactile...,\\" and, \\"then I became aware of a smell.\\" Later, after he had passed through the portal of heaven, he was told something by an angel, and her \\"message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief.\\" When he's in the Core (of heaven), he writes, \\"Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place where I now was. I could hear the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and I could see [sic] the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang.\\"<br /><br />It's curious to me that sensation, however modified his seeing and hearing were in heaven, were, nonetheless, one of his modes of knowing. This would make earthly hearing and seeing weak analogues of their heavenly counterparts, but more remarkably, not only our consciousness survives death, but also our senses! This implies that the material organs of sight and hearing are not essential to these capabilities. We do know that we can hear music in our mind that we are not hearing with our ears and see things in our mind that are not present to our eyes under two conditions: we're dreaming, or we've consciously induced them. But Alexander insists he is not dreaming and others are generating the sounds, sights, and smells. Although his claim fits his theory of post-death consciousness, he never died, and for those of us who are still pre-dead, a dreaming or inducing explanation is simpler and less fantastical. Also, we do know that physical eyes and ears are essential to earthly seeing and hearing under either of the main concepts of the body-mind relationship: that we are a mind (soul, spirit) trapped in a body and finally freed of it upon death, or we exist as an inseparable body-mind unity. Under the first condition, there would have to be some plausible theory to explain how the soul retains senses once it's left the body. Under the second condition, body and soul exist only as an integrated entity, at death extinguishing together.<br /><br />A related problem, advanced by his description of consciousness after death, is duality--or, if you will, the multiplicity of separately distinguishable beings/things/experiences in the post-death realm. Alexander's heaven eliminates the ego but retains distinct beings outside himself (for example, he doesn't claim to be God or the angle). Okay, maybe he wants to suggest that none of these separate and distinct beings have an ego, but something has to account for his recognizing that they (perceivable beings, music, smells, visuals of various kinds) arereal and are not just his projections. Maybe they exist like thoughts, perceptibly existing immaterial objects. The only problem with this is that we conjure our thoughts, and subconscious mechanisms conjure our dreams. I'm sure Alexander is not suggesting that his heaven is populated by conjured images--and he insists they're not dreams--but I don't see how he can escape the conundrum.<br /><br />Celestial existence for Alexander often seems conceptually similar to earthly experience, differing primarily in quality and seeming often little more than exquisite extensions of ordinary life. He does write, \\"The blurring of the boundary between my awareness and the realm around me went so far at times that I became the entire universe.\\" What is surprising about this statement is the \\"at times.\\" At one point in my life, I was an intermittent TMer. After several years of erratic adherence to my meditation practice, I routinely experienced extended periods non-dualistic absorption into a unitary bliss, timelessness, spacelessness, even occasional out-of-body consciousness. Thus, \\"at times\\" I had earthly experiences that were not dissimilar to what he describes as a peak heavenly experience--and I didn't have to die to experience them, making me wonder just how other-worldly they are.<br /><br />Alexander states that \\"up there\\" there's no emotional distinction between \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" because changes of \\"mood\\" experienced there are so vast as to include and affect both the mood feeler and his or her surroundings simultaneously. Commenting further on emotions, he writes, \\"All the human emotions are present [in heaven]....\\" Does he really want to assert that greed, avarice, lust, hate, and other such emotions reside with love in God's paradise? This completely contradicts other statements about the heavenly environment.<br /><br />He does mention evil, as necessary for there to be free will, which is required \\"for us to become what God longer for us to be.\\" However, hedoes not raise the issue of moral behavior as a prerequisite for heaven or as even affecting one's access to or enjoyment of heaven. Should I ever enter Alexander's rapture, I hope not to attend a dance and see Mother Theresa grinding with Adolph Hitler. But maybe I will, given that \\"in the larger picture love was overwhelmingly dominant, and it would ultimately be triumphant\\" over evil.<br /><br />Finally, the author's recitation of numerous failed attempts to explain his mental states while in a coma go only so far as demonstrating that extremely rare phenomena are less susceptible to explanation than are common ones. I hardly think that such a recognition would startle anyone.<br /><br />So, at best, I see Proof of Heaven as an engaging addition to NDE literature and at worst, an unsupported, indeed self-contradictory and sloppily analyzed, claim to a reality that fails to meet even the most obvious precondition: One has actually to die, not just come close to it, before earning the right to assert the post-death condition of consciousness.<br /><br />Of course, my concern about basing a belief in an afterlife on Alexander's experience while in a coma is irrelevant to whether or not there is an afterlife. I just don't think Proof of Heaven gets us any closer to proving it than we were with former NDE accounts. He may have been \\"allowed to die harder\\" than previous NDEers, but like them, he didn't die. I think he should have remained more the scientist upon coming out of his coma and considered his experience as evidence of what the brain may still do after the cranial cortex is compromised.<br /><br />Rather than counting on eternal consciousness, I think we should work on coming to terms with death's being the close of our one and only, randomly engendered, and unrepeatable existence. If we awake to having been mistaken and find ourselves in another dimension, nothing will be lost. If we don't awaken in paradise, we will not grieve it. In the meantime, we won'tviolate the knowable and will experience how precious, fleeting, and irreplaceable life is--ours and that of all other beings. It might be easier to have compassion for one another, if we don't presume that upon death we're whisked off to \\"a better place\\" where we'll all be reunited in bliss.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|OK, yes, another invasion of Earth by alien aggressors film. This time it's comets hitting the water and the invaders emerge from the surf. The film follows the experiences of a small group of Marines (from the same regiment as Eugene Sledge of `With the Old Breed' and `The Pacific' TV series as it turns out) who are sent to rescue some civilians trapped in the `infestation zone'. As others have written, it is mainly a war film but the Sci-Fi element utilises some of the aspects of horror films too. It was genuinely tense at times and the camera work emphasizes the grit, dirt and violence of urban fighting. There are plenty of explosions and not everyone makes it out alive. There's not a lot of time spent on character development and it's hard to believe that real marines would engage in some of the exchanges that take place. Some of the visuals are fantastic! Yes it has some of the usual features (clichés) of other films of the genres mentioned and developments are generally predictable but overall it is a pretty good action flick.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|great movie,watched it with my son and wife,he can't wait for the next bond movie to come out on dvd.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|We've purchased a lot of great kids games for our 3-yr old, but this isn't one of them.  Can't figure out how to play it. No instructions/support.  Poor quality, not well thought out at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book I the best book ever everybody has  to read it if u Don`t read it u r crazy
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Very similar to the Harrison Ford thriller Frantic, right down to the apartment of his female french accomplish. Heres a link if you like UNKNOWN you should enjoy this too. [[ASIN:B001PAUQE4 Frantic]]
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A good app for your kindle or Android device and simple to use.  I typed in the cities and states of all my friends and relatives so I can keep track of their weather....very accurate for my area, more accurate weather predictions than our local news channel or the newspaper (since we live on the outskirts of Phoenix AZ, our temperatures are different than at Sky Harbor Airport in downtown).  Love the 10 day forecast, and severe weather alerts--very useful.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Does what is supposed to do. The only other option I would like to see would be the ability to print.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|It is great book and I couldn't put it away. Certainly on the MUST read list for Castle (TV show) lovers.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Super fun game, my 8 year old and I love it.  If you like strategy games, you will like this one.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I've been using this cover -- in a bright purple color -- to protect my new 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.  The case was easy to put on the Kindle and is comfortable to hold onto when reading.  The stand-up feature is especially nice for watching videos in bed or on the go.  My only complaint is that the cover doesn't have enough padding to fully protect my Kindle Fire.  I accidentally dropped it in the snow last week, and when I went to turn it on, I got no response from my Kindle.  It is completely dead,  fortunately it's still on warranty, but I'm concerned that the cover doesn't provide the sturdy protection that I had hoped it would.  I don't know what the more expensive covers look or feel like, but it might be worth spending a bit more money on a cover that provides better protection, even if it does cost a bit more.
B007RP4D5Y|1.0|This particular album of Pat's is just too wierd for me.  More fusion-like and less melodic than most of his work.  Technically awesome but I didn't really enjoy listening to it much.
B000V39KDO|5.0|This movie rocks! We will never get tired of watching it! It was a great gift idea for my boyfriend!
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I especially love the song &#34;Wind in theTrees&#34; which allows Mike Kenelly to shine with a beautiful keyboard solo.  I felt this song was a real step up for Joe as he shared the spotlight with another instrument than Guitar.  All of the songs are good and most are great works of Joe.  If you like Joe, you will love this album!
B000VZUT64|5.0|I heard a song on the radio last weekend , I remembered how much I like this Band and downloaded it right away. They have a new album coming out this year I look forwad to checking it out.
B008ANFRGQ|1.0|I got a hint from other reviews that this album was DIFFERENT from his others but not really.  It uses a wider range of instruments and sounds and is as usual hyper-creative and jam-packed with musical ideas - the likes of which will strain the ear of the untraind listener.<br />Unless you love Vai, don't get this.
0765325950|3.0|But this was an ending.  While my initial complaint about the final book of the series was about the bloated battle sequences, upon further reflection, I already pretty much knew the final battle was going to be a grueling affair that tied up as many loose ends as possible.  I don't want to spoil anything, but I will share my favorites:    - getting to see Mat and Perrin in the roles that the entire series has been hinting they would play.  It IS just as awesome as you imagined.    - getting to see the Aes Sedai in battle (finally!!) against others wielding the One Power.  Also awesome.    - no more scenes of Min sitting around reading books or Elayne drinking goat's milk!! (though it is mentioned in passing)    Most of the characters are used in their full capacity (unfortunately, that includes Elayne), and it's wonderful to see them in true form.  Like I said, it's an ending.  I think it kind of cheats at the very, very end, but I've had several people tell me that they wouldn't have had it end any other way.  Can't please everyone, right?  Regardless of the few inadequacies I found while reading it, I still enjoyed it.  It's been a great (if slow) ride.
B007XNAQLA|3.0|I especially liked getting to know Chick Corea and the rest of the band via the video interviews on the last CD.  Seeing HOW they play really make one appreciat WHAT you hear more.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I made myself finish the book. Horribly written. Characters were annoying and unreal. Felt like it was written by a teenager.<br />Just not a believable story. Actually made me mad a few times. Ending was silly too. I think it targets a teenage audience.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Continuity and story line were all there.  China definately the yin and yang of evil adversaries but would like to see the next one take some unexpected world turn.  In any case looking forward to that next one......

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|No doubt this has been the best best book I have ever read in my entire life! They should definitely think about making a fourth book!!!
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I got this mp3 album. I had made other purchases and had credits. I had heard several other of his songs and liked them so I figured why not. Turned out I enjoyed listening to the whole album. Worth the price on Amazon MP3.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book of English words is simply amazing. Although I had some trouble finding a word that was in the z section. It is a great book but would be out of this world amazing if you could just type in the word you are looking for instead of having to flip through all those pages. This dictionary is awesome!!!!!!!!
B002RAWWLQ|4.0|I bought this for my Grandma who had lost her copies. She loves to play nothing but this type of music during the holidays. It brought back memories of childhood. She was very happy and also my nieces and nephews enjoyed listening to this as they learned all about Jacksons due to Micheal Jacksons death.
B006RXQ6XE|5.0|In so many ways this movie intrigued me.  I've seen it multiple times and with each viewing, there's something new to appreciate. First and most obvious, to me, is Sylvester Stallone (whom I'm no fan been a fan of, believing him to be one-dimensional) who absolutely wowed me in this movie, and though I'm still not a fan, I do appreciate just the depth w/which he acted in Cop Land. Really impressive and a tribute to either him or the director...or who/whatever helped him play this character.<br />That aside, there's a lot more to appreciate...the story, the intensity, the characters (there wasn't bad acting on anyone's part). It's become one of my favorites because I know whenever I'm in the mood to see this movie, I know there'll be something I never noticed in prior viewings that make me appreciate it even more. I'm no movie connoisseur but Cop Land helped me appreciate the finer points of making a good movie, in a subtle way, w/big, fat emotions.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|great game to pass the time go for the gold stars is the challenge .the whole point is to fill the cup with ice with gthe fewest strkes
B009LL4LMM|4.0|this game is very fun. the story line is cute. even a dude such as my self has to admit it. Definitely recommend this game to people
0345803493|5.0|These two are something else. He really loved her but he only realized it after she left him. He also have a lot of baggage with him and trust issues which makes it always an disagreement between the two with great make up sex. I really think he turned her out as well with the kinkiness. A must have book.
B001P3SA94|5.0|wonderful movie
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book very good!!!!it was funny and exciting and hooking great book!!!! :) haha thanks for writing it!
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|Amazon needs to learn from iTunes video.  Very sloppy execution of the process.  Took about four tries before it connected.<br /><br />Disappointing video quality.<br /><br />Still a great show.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was hooked throughout the entire read, very intriguing and well written. I would recommend to all young adults. :)
B008HK3XYK|2.0|In theory, the case is nice. Thin and nice-feeling with minimal bulk.<br /><br />On the downside: no portrait display, stand-up feature in landscape tends to slip and slide, viewing angle was a sub-optimal in my opinion.<br /><br />Bought the rooCase instead and love it.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Big fan of the tv series. There are some differences that keep it interesting. They really make you ask yourself what would I do.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ok, I haven't had time to read the reviews on here, and I'm sure that I'm going to duplicate some(most) of the comments already made.<br /><br />Let me preface by saying that I hate anything overly popular... As soon as everyone starting raving and running out to buy the latest thing, it turns me off from it.. whatever it may be.. cellphones, books, t.v shows, movies, ect.... I swore that I would not read this book..... Well, I gave in. I bought this book with a gift card that I received for Christmas. Worst. Mistake. Ever.<br /><br />Sigh, where to begin. After a few \\"looking through her lashes... biting her lower lip\\" I was seriously \\"rolling my eyes\\". Little did I know, there would be more lashes, lips, and eyes to come... On... every... page. My \\"inner goddess\\" really wanted to burn this book right then and there, but it was on my Kindle.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele... oh poor Anastasia Steele. You have never, in your 21 years of life, had an email address? You drink more Twinning English Breakfast tea than all of England put together. You are \\"so pleased to see your mother\\"? Really??? In my 34 years of life, I have never said \\"I'm so pleased to see you\\". Your \\"down there\\" has a name.. Ms. College Literary student. Oh yeah.. you didn't know what a wet dream was???<br /><br />Christian Grey... What can I say about him. He has grey eyes.. he cocks his head to the side.. he grabs her hair so she can't move...with all of the experience that he has had, you would think that he could last more than a minute, (if you know what I mean)....and oh yeah, he's a woman abusing psychopath! (with grey eyes and a grin that doesn't reach his eyes)<br /><br />If you took out the sex, which was so very juvenile, this book would be about a girl getting domestically abused by a guy that doesn't even want a relationship with her.<br /><br />Please people.. STOP BUYING THIS BOOK! Buy a book that is actually worth reading, and not some overly hyped, poorly written, no plot having garbage. I now feel confident that I can finish writing the book I was working on, and maybe become a best seller too... *rolls eyes*
0765350386|1.0|Highly praised on Goodreads. 4.5 rating on Amazon. A safe bet, right? Not so fast.<br /><br />The magic system, and the introduction to the world Sanderson created, was sufficient to keep my interest for the first third of the book. Barely. From that point on, it was a slog.<br /><br />It is simply very poorly written. The plot is twisty, but full of holes. The characters are flat. There is little and arguably no believable character development, and what little \\"development\\" occurs comes in the form of progressive reveals of a backstory set up in advance. Vin, the young heroine, is untrusting and scarred one moment, and head over heels in love and spilling secrets the next. The dialogue makes me wince -- idiomatically, think \\"California junior high\\" -- and all of the characters talk the same way. Conversations are less about conversing, and more about pontificating out loud about events just to bring the reader up to speed.<br /><br />What went wrong? Why does this garner so many positive reviews? I'm frankly stumped. Obviously, some people like it.<br /><br />Will you react like me to this book? I don't know, but here is a little background: I read Sci Fi and fantasy voraciously through high school -- Tolkien, Heinlein, Feist, Donaldson, Le Guin, I was and am big fans of all of them. Then it was primarily nonfiction and \\"literary\\" fiction for many years. Recently, I returned to the fantasy genre for the occasional weekend / vacation read. Finished Rowling, and the GRR Martin series. Loved them. Hated this.<br /><br />Good luck.
B008F9E306|5.0|This album was apart of my Christmas gifts to my daughter!  She was amazed by this album.  She's a T.I fan.  The look on her face made me glad I chose it.  Now I hope she'll share with Momma. ;)

B007XNAPX4|5.0|Nearly twenty years after the fact, I have finally, and happily, discovered this show. Peter Gabriel's album \\"Us\\" had not impressed me as much as his previous work, and noting how heavily the Secret World tour drew from that album, I had dismissed it out of hand. That was one of the biggest mistakes I could have made, and the power of this performance has made me favorably re-evaluate the album!<br /><br />For many years I have held the Talking Heads movie \\"Stop Making Sense\\" as the gold standard of live performance rock movies, but now \\"Secret World Live\\" has knocked it from the throne.  Seldom do concept, direction, stagecraft, performance and enthusiasm combine like they do here.  At three minutes into the disc, when the camera cut to Paula Cole on that bare, round second stage, I knew that something very special was captured here, and by the time that \\"Shaking the Tree\\" was over, I knew that this was a tour de force, worthy of multiple viewings.<br /><br />The absence of many of Gabriel's earlier hit songs only serves to draw his later more introspective work into a cohesive whole. The play list is just about right.<br /><br />As for disc quality, I'm talking here about the new release of 2012, on Blu-ray or DVD, so just ignore all of the negative comments about quality in reviews prior to this release. This is the new stuff. I don't care how awful the earlier DVD was, and I will never watch it anyway. It's sad how reviews of totally different products and releases are lumped into the same pile here.<br /><br />The show was recorded on 16mm film, and an amount of graininess is present, more in some shots than others, but the new transfer is very good, and the sound quality is wonderful. I've scrutinized this performance many times now, and most of the synchronization problems others have noted seem to have been worked out; the few I detect I will attribute to the show being a compilation of performances on two separate nights. Hey, Amazon: how about editing youreditorial review for this product? That review is ten years old, and now inaccurate. And as for comments about pre-recorded or programmed music tracks and video, isn't it obvious? Just part of the show, folks.<br /><br />This disc belongs in your collection. The Blu-ray disc is fantastic, and I have bought DVD copies for my friends.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Halle berry or hallelujah. Pick ur poison tell me what u doin. Everybody gon respect the shooter, but the one in front of the gun lives forever. And I been hustlin all day. Thisa way thata way, thru canals and alley ways just to say, money trees is the perfect place for shade. And that's just how I feel!
B004OZZ624|5.0|Short and sweet. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Well acted, great tempo throughout kept the story moving and the suspense up till the very end.
0765325950|1.0|Was really looking forward to this, but hard bound books are bad for the environment and are much too heavy for a frequent traveler like me.  Guess I will be looking for this on the net.
B00000J048|4.0|ALL of us love playing with this toy.  My 6 year old gets a little bored with it but my 3 year old and my husband love building with it.  made of durable plastice, would be hard to break it, which is great for my 3 year old.  The 3 year old does need a bit of help aligning the gears but he's starting to get the hang of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this iss just what i wanted ald asI get into reading it is a great sport wne i think they whoule
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Really like it but get dissappointed at teasers that would require indirect subscriptions.  I would almost rather not see the article at all if I can't read it in it's entirety
1936608898|5.0|very educational, informative, and great read. i would recommend this read  to anyone out there trying to eat WHOLE--fully & get on track to a healthy lifestlye!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my son loves this game. He has downloaded it also on my iPhone to play in the car while we are out.
030758836X|5.0|Definitely deserving of it's status in the Best of 2012.  Gillian Flynn writes with razor-sharp insights into these deeply troubled, hateful but somehow lovable characters.  The mystery is intriguing, the plotting ingenious, the research excellent, but what I liked best of all was the examination of one of society's most revered institutions:  marriage.  As well, the social commentary and satire of America's media culture had me in stitches at times.  It seems the author allowed herself to have a great deal of fun with this novel.  I have already ordered her first two novels and hope to enjoy them.  Although she states that she didn't structure this book to allow for a sequel, I for one beg Gillian Flynn to revisit our deeply disturbed duo.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The Tom Clancy Trend Continues in great form and style. He keeps your interest peaked from the first page and you read well into the night.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|this game is great but would they please make the update for the starfruit like on the ipod/iphone because these rewards are just pointless.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who only reads DeMille, and decided to read it before giving it to him for Christmas.  Glad I did.  It's typical Demille...great writing, great mystery, great humor.  If you've never picked up a DeMille before, try a couple earlier books first; then you will understand who John Corey is.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I love it!  It works great.  Makes me enjoy my Kindle even more!!!!!  Thanks!!!!!!  Makes time at work zoom by!
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Very simple.  Might be ok for kids but I found it totally boring after 5 minutes of play.  Also had some issues opening on kindle fire.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I purchased this dvd after seeing the 25th Anniversary concert on PBS when it was originally done 2 years ago & again this past  December.  It is so well done, using costuming & minimal props & not just the cast singing each song in order.  It is nearly a full production & what makes it better is the encore(s) during which time the original cast members join the others on stage & sing.  The highlight of the entire production was when all 4 of the actors who have played Jean Valjean came together & sang both individually and together!  It is truly amazing!  This I will watch over & over again!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|He's been a long time coming, and he passionate, and very gifted. I love this album! I'm a christian, and it makes me sad to think that he's been burned by the church (what kind of church, i'm not sure of) and has rejected Christ. Many people rep Christ in horrible ways; they let people down, and sometimes are even abusive. Abuse shouldn't be tolerated in any arena! But people that make up a church make mistakes, and that just proves the message of Christ even further; we're broken people in need of a savior! People will let you down, and even hurt you. We all know this is true! But the point of Christ's message is just that! And He alone is the answer for our mistakes, and the the only hope of redemption!<br /><br />So Macklemore, I love you, and I love what you and Ryan have made here! But please don't reject Jesus Christ because you were lied to about what He is really about, and who he really is! Keep up the good work!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Just had to get this to finish up my MB collection, of course I dont think its as good as the first two, but other people I speak to do. I just love the dog in the first two and more aliens so... anyway still an AWESOME movie. 5 stars !
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Oh my goodness, this trilogy has been an interesting ride. Firstly, the books are very well written. Dashner does a wonderful job keeping the reader engaged and entertained. The trilogy is action packed, interesting, and thought-provoking. There are several moments in the book where we feel with Thomas and all the difficult decisions he must deal with. Though all our questions are not answered, I felt the series ended well. I wish he would write an epilogue series! All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was not too hard and not too easy. Lasts a good amount of time! Amazing graphics! Great price when I got it. I think it was free.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Great album, when I purchased it I listened to it over and over. Love J. Mayer's music!  I enjoy almost all of the songs on the album. I'm glad I got the album and didn't purchase individual songs.
0765325950|5.0|This is an exhausting whirlwind of a book, with many battles and characters followed. Brandon does a masterful job of making sure the reader is never confused about what is happening. I read the book in two days, and it was a brilliant conclusion to a series that has had many ups and downs. Brandon really was the right person to conclude the series.<br /><br />It is disappointing that many people here are protesting against the ebook not being available with one-star reviews. The purpose of the reviews sections is to review the book. If you have an issue, start a petition, post on a forum... whatever. This is not the right place for it.
0439023513|5.0|When I first read Mockingjay, I was really pissed off with the way that it ended. I'm not going to say anything or elaborate on why, but I just felt that it was not in Katniss' nature to let things end like that.<br /><br />But the more I read it over and the longer I think about it, I think it was a fitting end, again I won't elaborate as to not ruin the story. In the end, I think it was a great ending to a fantastic series. I was sad to say goodbye to something that was so fun.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Bad: story, script, cast, dialogue, acting, special effects.<br /><br />Good:  free<br /><br />A complete and total waste of time.  This makes the original look like a masterpiece.  Sigh, what a turd.
0439023491|4.0|I love the Hunger Game series. Loved them, but sort of felt like the second one was a repeat of the first. Not that it was a bad thing, just that it kind of felt like deja vous.
0679457313|5.0|I bought it for grand daughters high school project, arrived on time as advertised, will purchase from this vendor again
0439023521|5.0|I don't think I put this book down once. I read it through in one sitting, mayyybe two. I've read this book over several times and it still captivates and surprises me, it's a great read.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Love this show! This is by far the funniest sitcom in history, and the third season continues the hilarious legacy,
B005OP7162|5.0|I love this series because the writing is balanced beautifully between drama and comedy.  I also enjoy the show's flashbacks and flashforwards.  Even though some of the story lines get a bit ridiculous, the plot twists and turns are worth it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I saw the movie in theatres and I have been waiting for it to come out on Netflix. So I rented it on Amazon, I just love this movie!
B00005JOHC|5.0|Love this season and sock golf is the best Charlie!  Charlie Lives for ever in my home and I hope they bring him back to continue his legacy.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|Nothing wrong with the quality of the set physically, exactly as one expects from a series DVD box these days. An enjoyable season, but that is less objective than the actual item condition.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Sean Penn is fantastic in this film...one of my favorites from Mr. Eastwood.This is a definite must see. Acting is superb.
B0019CSXAM|4.0|Nothing wrong with the quality of the set physically, exactly as one expects from a series DVD box these days. An enjoyable season, but that is less objective than the actual item condition.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i was so excited to read this book, through out it was a constant page turnner. however the ending was lacking and seemed to just drop off. almost as if the author got tired of writing. needless to say when i was done reading, i was very disappointed.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I have loved sonic my entire life and I haven't been able to play this but now for only 5  bucks I can play the best sonic game ever I give it a billion stars .
0385360185|5.0|Loved this series, I'm on book 3 and I don't want it to end. I hope that when the movie comes out that Ian Somerhalder gets the role, he would be a perfect Christian Grey
B006LSZECO|4.0|It starts slowly, but soon I found I couldn't put it down!! And I can't believe the twist!! Didn't see that coming!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an awesome book. A must read. The story behind all the hot sex is amazing. I just wanted to read more of their love story.
0761171703|5.0|Such a wonderful book, I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine (a dancer at heart) and was able to preview it before giving it to her. Stunning photos, Jordan Matter really catches the beauty of these dancers. A wonderful gift choice for anybody, dancer or not. We both loved it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great great great ending.  Keeps you guessing.  If you loved Shades of Grey this book is for you.  Same concept but a little more drama.
B00AMS4H2M|5.0|Listen I didnt buy this album on here; I bought it on itunes. With that said, did TI take one of yaw girls or somethin'. I mean damn. This album is straight. Its better than Chief Keef's Album and Meek Millz(Which is really not that good). This is in the top 3 maybe 5 albums that hit last year. And Im happy for TI. This will be burnt to CD and played in my car. Those who read this review just buy the album.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love it..... really liked how it got sooooooo loud and I could do math problems :)<br />thAnk you so much it really helped me out!
0345027507|4.0|I have always enjoyed Arthur c Clarke's books, this was one i must have missed. A great story as always.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Great book I love this book but I want brokeback mountain it would be the best book ever omg love Kyle bivings
0920668364|5.0|I loved this book.  I am a Grandma with 2 grand babies.  And one on the way.  I just happened across this book and ordered it.  I received it and sat down to read it aloud (to me and my cat).  Well, it's amazing how quickly the tears came to my eyes,  by the end of this sweet story.  I don't think i have had that reaction with any other child's book ever.  I just loved it!  I just finished ordering 2 more copies for both grand-child. ( one is in NY and the other in VA).  Don't miss out on this little gem of a book!!
0385536828|2.0|I have read almost everything McEwan has written.  The early short stories are superb, macabre, creepy sometimes.  When he went on to novels he maintained his extraordinary ability to tell subtle horror stories.....The Comfort of Strangers is chilling.  After that came the wonderful Booker Prize winner Amsterdam (still my favorite).<br /><br />With Atonement he went in a different direction....excellent as usual, but with a strange structure and the big Reveal was a bit on the cute side.  Saturday is essentially a bunch of short stories rolled into one big story.  On Chesil Beach is essentially a novella, masterfully done, all about one moment in time.<br /><br />Now Sweet Tooth, and he is once again in Atonement mode.  The beginning was pure Graham Greene and wonderful, but then it takes a detour through summaries of short stories written by one of the characters and then down the Atonement rabbit hole, guaranteed to disappoint the reader.<br /><br />Hopefully Mr. McEwan will get out of this silly thicket of trickery.
B000002A46|4.0|it wasnt as good as I hoped it would be, but still pleasant to listen to - wouldn't purchase again
1593272782|5.0|Great  idea for my 9 & 4 year old!  I love it and so do they!  Hours of fun and creativity!
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Positively awesome! Probably the best re-make of all time. I will most definitely be watching this movie over and over again. 5 stars!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was late to jump on the Homeland bandwagon but my God did I jump in full force.  Thanks to Amazon, I basically blew through the first season in 2 days and immediately added Showtime to my cable account so I could watch season two.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The supposed name of the MI5 operation to disabuse the populace of communist sympathies during the Cold War of the 1970's, \\"Sweet Tooth\\", is carried by a plot whose subject is, superficially, about MI5 and spies but, ultimately, a story of the tensions between love and deception.<br />This becomes clearer as we see McEwan build the character of Serena Frome, an attractive middle-classed woman educated at prestigious Cambridge University, her father a bishop and yet her choice of men is either so hurried as to be ill-judged or else purely capricious as she works her way unsuccessfully through several partners.<br />One lover turns out to be a homosexual, another lightning relationship with an older lecturer collapses and still another leads to a job at MI5, the man, apart from the glamour of his job turning out to be a singularly clumsy lover until she hits finally settles on on an author, Tom Haley, from whom she must struggle to conceal the nature of her work.<br />The tension, for me, was not so much in the vein of the conventional spy novel but in the web of intrigue and deception between the characters themselves. Even so, interminable weekend encounters used to test the skill of each in hiding their secrets began to jar on me and though the ending tends to justify the slow development, it did require, at times, superhuman patience to keep reading for the denouement.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!  I didn't want it to end!  A quick and easy read which makes it even better if your always find yourself short on time.
1402736924|5.0|This is great story and shorten for an elementary school reader.  A classic that every young girl should read or be read to.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|neat movie.  i substitute teach in a city called Stockton, CA and it has some shady areas where drugs and violence reign.  This i guess tried to show things about how people get bogged down.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|really great game. enjoyed playing this one. have played a lot of the games and thought there were no good ones left. glad I found this one.
B00005RY7X|4.0|this is a really cool album.  it is a really simple album.  It will make you laugh.  It will make you agree with him
B00A757EFW|4.0|It is harder to control than the original  pacman of the 80''s with its joystick.  It is a good replacement for the Kindle.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|This music is so fun to listen to and go watch.  It is in your face and gnarly.  wolf mother rules.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song is as good as the next.  This is the cd when I want to sing my heart out and not care if anyone is watching.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very fun. First game on my new kindle. Lots of good puzzles.<br />Good story too. I will probably buy more of these games.
B00936A0RU|4.0|Great movie touches all the bases you want in a good movie.  It does have one or two slow moving parts, but well worth seeing through to the end.  You'll want to watch it a second time.
B000MXJ7LS|5.0|I thought this was done very well; most important my son asked me to get it it for him.  If you knew my son  you would understand what a copliment this was.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great British drama that has me hanging on for the next episode.  Great acting, realistic set and design and wonderful writing and plot.  A must see.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Bring the tissues and be prepared to cry and laugh out loud at this view of life from this extrordinary dog's vantage point.  Funny loving and insightful.  Good read!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I found this Grisham story very intriguing, with his usual twist bringing even more<br />excitement to the plot. I read it in only two or three sittings; it was that grabbing a novel!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had the beginning of this story figured out. What keeps you hooked is the thoughts and insights into the main female character's psyche. What will make this book a better read for someone is if they are interested in psychology. What ruins the book is the ending because there isn't one, nothing is wrapped up concluded and leaves you hanging highly disappointed!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Very good story and was nice to see Annabeth's point of view for a change, however in my opinion I wish I had waited until the next book came out as there is a major cliff hangar at the end.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I liked the cd. Yes there are some songs not that great,  but you get that with most every cd.
0307887448|5.0|I do not claim to be an all knowing geek of  80's pop culture but I am a boomer and do remember some games and movies from that era. This book was so much fun to read because it brings old memories of those days literally back to life. For example the author mentions the music from RUSH. I love their music always have and their new album Clockwork Angels is awesome much like their older stuff. He also talks about old video games like GALAGA. I used to play that game lots of fun. The author is a very visual writer. For example he writes about how Wade (parzival) steals IOI secure data while literally sleeping in a little shelf and working in his little cubicle as an indentured servant to find a way to deactivate a shield  so that the gunters can enter Anoraks Castle to enter the third gate. The book seems so real I don't see how a good movie could not come out of this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is fun you put your skills up to the test and try to get the Colors to their pair.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Perfect for getting my brain to wind down at night. More free sounds available to download from their blog. Great buy!
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV in my opinion. I could ramble on about what those other shows are, but I'm here to talk about this. I think that fact that this show is on HBO sorta sucks because only select people can watch it, but if it was on normal cable television then it would be nowhere near as good because there would be much less violence, sexuality, and plot. I ordered the Blu-ray/DVD/DC Collectors Edition, and I love it. I have Blu-ray to myself, DVD to loan to family and friends, and DC to watch on my IPhone or IPad.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I have 3 girls 7, 9, 11. They play this all the time. I think it helps them to learn pitch.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I haven't finished this book yet.. But so far it's been a lot more exciting than the first.  More action! You also get to know the characters a little better.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I love trying out a new book on this.LORD DIAPER RULES the world.Manny and Roderick RULE the world and BYE.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The author does an excellent job in bringing life to the subtle pains and inspirations of living the effects of war. There are few wasted words in this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I thought for sure they would fall in love right away, but it took a different twist.  The author did a great job of keeping you engaged in their lives.  I recommend this book!
B00133KHCY|5.0|My hubby and I love it! We have the DVD, and now we decided to get the BluRay. We recommend it to anyone...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  Good story, well paced and well written.  Anyone who likes a good near future scifi novel will enjoy this book.
B004LKRR6U|5.0|I bought this doll for my greatgranddaughter for Christmas in 2011.  It was a very pretty doll and she really liked it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|What a great idea for a game. It is easy, imaginative, and entertaining!<br />I was impressed by the how much the kids loved it.
B0031QVW2U|5.0|It works great in concert with the Black Rapid RS-5 Camera Strap. I would recommend this accessory if your looking for a secure strap for when you need to make sure your camera secure and is ready for action.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|First book to be bought on my new Kindle - great read.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone who hasen't yet read this one - slow to start but gets going after a while, then keeps you hooked till the end
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Kept me rivited, didn't want to put in down. Child is a very good writer. Am start the 6th book in the series.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I banged this out in 2 nights because its very readable, interesting, and develops very quickly . A feel good story that makes you think. Watch for the omens ;)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a little shocking at first but I had to read it to find out what all the hope was about. I enjoyed it.
B009738XXM|2.0|I feel ripped off. I paid for the full album but didn't get it.  I didn't even get the song I wanted that I was buying the CD for.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed it but  not much of a story but you have to read all three books because of the endings
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Fell in love with this band after seeing a special on Palladia. Southern rock with incredible vocals and guitar work by Charlie Starr. Every track is excellent.
0761169253|5.0|I think most of know this stuff...but its great to have a reminder. And also have it collected and presented this way. perfect book to pull you out of a creative rut. Worth the read...100%. And its a super fast read too. Double plus. :-)
B0063IH60K|3.0|The gifts were enjoyed by all. The items for my own use were more or less just what I wanted.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was very informative regarding the treatment of the Jews during this time period without being too graphic  Interesting story line also.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Didnt think it was gonna be good, ended up being great! Movie was sweet and thats all i'v got to say
B0086700CM|5.0|Great program and game. The one additional challenge is to see what you can do without paying (too much) extra. Can't wait for the soon next episode.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was curious to read it, it is so popular.  I suppose it's because of the tons of explicit sex scenes.  I found myself flipping the pages sometimes over the sex scenes to get back to the story.  Altough i read it in my second language, i found the autor very repetitive and lacking vocabulary.  It's not a well written book.  However I read the three books out of curiosity, but I'm glad I'm finished.
B0026PW67W|1.0|I am sorry but for the price I thought it was a total rip off!The Paper and the ink did not cost 1/4 of that I'm sure.For the price it should have been three times the size. I feel that I paid for nothing but the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; name.<br />Mrs.C.Pfeifer
B0001CCY7E|5.0|. ....Beautiful, beautiful music. This CD is so worth having.in your collection. A must have for all you REAL music lovers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was sooo much better than the first! I liked the first one, but this one really made me feel like I knew the characters and it had action as well. To those who think this series is just about sex you are COMPLETELY wrong! There is much more to these books, and I really enjoyed the series and highly recommend it to someone who wants a steamy series to read. Especially since I am not much of a reader unless a book is really good, this one definitely had me captivated.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is a great start to an exciting series. I was introduced to Brandon Sanderson's writing because he took over writing the Wheel of Time series. I have bought everyone of his books and enjoyed each of them immensely
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So sad the trilogy came to an end :'(. I loved this series and want to read it over and over. I know there have been many mixed reviews about this series, and I must say that everyone should read it with an open mind. I do not understand why people get mad about these books and feel like wow Christian Grey is sick...Blah blah blah, it is a book, get over it. Can things like this happen, yes, but seriously get over it people. Anyways I know some people may not have been impressed after the first book and were wondering why all the hype about this book. Trust me I liked the first book, but was not completely sold. Books 2 & 3 are sooo much better and amazing. I want more!!!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I really enjoyed the whole Mistborn series. The Magic system is well done and each character was my favorite. The conclusion is awesome!
B00846REIS|4.0|I absolutely loved the 50 Shades Trilogy, and although this book has been good thus far I still cannot get into it. It is very steamy, and well written, better written than the 50 Shades books (vocabulary wise), but still it just does not have the same charm. I have never really been a person to read romance novels at all, but to be honest I feel like this book is a terrible knock off of the 50 Shades Trilogy. I mean really the author seems to be copying the story, just changing the names and the story ever so slightly. I guess if you are dying for another book like 50 Shades, then this is a good read, but otherwise I'd pass.
B000P0J09C|5.0|I always love watching this movie. I can't believe it took so long to get it for my DVD collection.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|First thing I did when I got this was sharpen a Gerber flip I've had for several years that has never been sharpened.  10 pulls through this sharpener and it was as sharp as the day I bought it.  Effortless sharpening.
0345803485|1.0|Even if you were still in hs, you would slap this moronic girl for being a naive idiot, was she raised in a barn? She is beyond repetitive and annoying and I whinny! I'm just so upset I bought a book and added to the profit of this idiotic book
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I have had so many &#34;what is wrong with me moments&#34; that I eventually chalked up to some other quirk of mine or the other person.  Reading this made me realize it's not that something is wrong with me.  It's that I am introverted but feel forced to pretend I am not...resulting in discomfort a lot of the time.<br /><br />Susan Cain uses actual scientific studies, anecdotes and personal stories to illustrate her points.  Then she gives advice on how to deal better with being an introvert in a loud world.  I highlighted and made so many notes that my copy looks like a textbook!  Great read!!!!
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|This is a fun, action packed movie, that was not available in any of my local retail outlets.  My grandkids love action films and this was an &#34;oldie&#34; but a &#34;goodie&#34;, as for as they were concerned.  Good price and fast shipping, thanks to Amazon.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I wish there had been books like this when I was a teenager.  Can't wait for the movies to see if they capture the same feel as the books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book.  I'm always uncertain about the movie being made from a book especially when they don't follow the book throughout.  The book is always, by far, better than any movie pretending the book.  But I still love this book as with the other two in the series.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Being a fan of the &#34;Alien&#34; movie series I had to see this. I found the movie to be very entertaining but it still left a lot unanswered. As for the quality of the disc set itself...very nice. I can't wait to own a 3D TV to enjoy this movie in 3D. This is definitely a worthwhile purchase and good addition to any Blu-ray collection.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enlightening story and told by someone who has been there...done that.  It offers so much more than what I expected with his experience during all of the years he was in training.  Good insight into what these brave guys do and why we are so proud of them.  Not everyone can walk in their shoes.  Tough bunch of guys indeed.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|It was a bit graphic, but interesting none the less. A fun look into the mind of a creative person
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read instead of watching TV, so I read a lot of books.  When someone asks me what I have read lately that I would recommend, I always say \\"Art of Racing in the Rain\\".  I have had a Kindle since 2010, and this is only the second review that I have written.
0547848412|5.0|best well written book ever @ this time 'Life of Pi' saw the movie also follows the book quite well
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Enjoyed hearing old songs that were produced in high fidelity.  It's good &#34;fire up&#34; music when I need a break during the day.
B005LAIHCM|4.0|House at the End of the Street captured my attention from the moment it started and it kept my attention through out the movie. It had a great story to it and kept me guessing what was going to happen next. It was not the predictable scary story. Many times through out the movie, it had me jumping in my seat. I liked how the story of this movie was not so easy to figure out as well. It had me confused at a few parts, but at the end of it, it all came together. The suspense kept me interested and I was glued to the screen the entire time. Horror movies are my favorite movies anyways, and this movie lived up to my expectations. Most horror movies are predictable and its nothing that people haven't ever seen before. House at the End of the Street was exciting and surprising. There were several parts where I thought the main character Elissa was seriously about to die, and the movie was about to end. Out of nowhere something would happen and create a whole new scenario. As I stated before, House at the End of the Street left me guessing. The way that the story played out kept it interesting. The fact that the daughter of the parents who had been brutally murdered by her, is found later in the movie deep inside the eerie basement of the family home, was a shock to me. Another shock ended up being that the son Ryan, who was still living in the family home, was keeping his sister there because she was the only family that he had left. Elissa begins to feel sorry for Ryan because people in the town do not like him because of his family history. The biggest shock of all was when Ryan tried to use Elissa as a replacement of his sister, because his sister died a long time ago and ever since then he has just been finding girls to replace his sister. Eventually the girls get away or die, so then he must replace them. Overall this story really kept me interested and it was one of the best scary movies I have seen.<br /><br />Ashley Benton<br />AP Language and Composition<br />Mr.Smith<br />5th Period
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Quick read keeps you wanting to keep reading to find out results of a bad relation to a good relationship
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I've enjoyed listening to the CD and watching the DVD. It fits in well with my library of Sting albums. Great product.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|I bought this book mainly to read Frankl`s accounts of his time in the concentration camps. This was interesting, but part 2 regarding logo therapy is what made the book for me. Couldn't stop reading once I got to the second half of the book.
B000FC10WU|5.0|It sure keeps you guessing about &#34;who done it&#34;. It is a great book and would recomend it to anyone who likes mysteries.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It might seem like too much $ but it is cool. I am a fan of minecraft and you might not like it but if you play it you will like it. It has everything like in pc it has creative and survival and you can activate the nether reactor but be careful where you put it. But other than that you can build anything you want so in my opinion get it.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I'm a big Zombie movie fan, so naturally when a show came out I was first in line. Season 1 was great, Season 2 was even better. If you love Zombie films, just go buy Walking Dead!!! Well worth it! I am looking forward to Season 3!!!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I bought Season 1 for my daughter and the price was excellent and it came faster than it said it would arrive.  I will order all movies from gohastings when I can.  My daughter has watched half of the season already and we are waiting for Season 3.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I had a hard time getting into this show, I felt like it was too chaotic and not well written at first. But like most new shows, you shouldn't judge it to quickly. It really turned out to be intense and creative. I liked the twist on the aliens taking over the world plot... watch it to see what I mean, I wont spoil it of you. I am looking forward to Season 2, I hope this show goes on for a few seasons, and people give it a chance to be great.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun to play can play on the go the kids like to play in the car and they understand it. a very good game.
B00746O3X8|5.0|As with everything photography related, I try hard as I can to save cash money bling. I loved the idea of having a cotton carrier because I didn't want my camera/s swinging around when I'm walking or dashing from place to place to cover an event. But there was no way I was going to spend a couple hundred dollars for the privilege. I'd rather make a harness out of duct tape. So when I came upon this by accident I didn't hesitate to order it. For only $40 it was worth the gamble and I honestly can't imagine the Cotton Carrier being much better, let alone $160 better.<br /><br />The nicest features of this harness are the way you can remove the hip holster and mount it to other straps such as a belt or messenger bag or backpack. That's helpful for hiking. Also, for storage I grabbed myself a small slr camera bag and lens bag and was able to slide those onto the left side of the harness and can carry all of my batteries, flash and accessories without needing a pack or case with me at all times.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I enjoyed seeing this movie.  It is similar to the first one with Arnold S.  But it is different enough to keep you guessing at what is coming next.  Colin F did a fine job.  Full of suspense.
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|Doppy me, did not check out the warning on album. Some songs not appropriate for &#34;wholesome&#34; music seekers. The warning is there in print though. Would not purchase again
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is such a marvelous rendition of Annie. I listen to it daily and it makes me smile and feel great.
1449410243|5.0|Matthew Inman is a genius on par with Plato, Nietzcshe, and that homeless guy that is always yelling about soup in the downtown of my city.  What do these four have in common?  Besides being philosophers, each one of them is a little bit bat [...] insane.... some more than others of course.     But what none of those other three has is a massively popular website.  The oatmeal is a must read, and this book while containing a lot of content found on that site, also offers fresh material as well.  Plus it just makes a great christmas gift.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and was really pleased with 80 percent of it... the other 20 was just REALLY intense! *spoiler* I do not have experience with incest and abuse! I USUALLY GO FOR MORE THE FAIRY TALE BUBBLE GUM TYPE BOOKS!! I had to put it down more than once just to digest what was happening! I really thought the author did a great job with the characters and the overall message! Bad things can happen to good people and sometimes life will knock you down but you can always dust yourself off and keep living.... This definitely isn't a book I will forget any time soon!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|What a simple concept... roll dice.  Brains = good, shotgun = bad.<br /><br />Yet, when I took it to my sister in laws house the other night 5 of us sat around playing it for hours... and we weren't even drinking or anything.  The simplicity of the game makes it easy to play while talking and being social, yet the strategy and random chance makes it fun and keeps it from getting boring.  I promised my sister in law I would .... ahem. ... buy her son a copy for his birthday.  I can't wait to see who actually plays it more.<br /><br />:)
0385751532|1.0|[[ASIN:1480163201 Memories of Evil: Recalling a World War II Childhood]]<br /><br />This review was written by my husband.<br /><br />A friend forwarded me a copy of this book and asked for my reaction. Here it is.<br /><br />Reading some of the other many reviews that this very successful book elicited, I have come to the inescapable conclusion that many of the reviewers betray a woeful ignorance of historical facts: facts about the Holocaust in general and about concentration camps in particular.<br /><br />I am writing this as one who was there -- I myself was once a boy in striped pajamas; I am a survivor of six German concentration camps. I think this makes me competent to give you the following very basic facts about these camps.<br /><br />Each camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence about 10-ft high; the fence was electrified; along its inside perimeter rose guard towers; each tower was manned by an armed guard around the clock; searchlights illuminated the fence during the night; each guard was responsible for the segment of fence within his vision; his duty was to prevent anyone from approaching the fence -- not from the inside, nor from the outside; he was under orders to shoot anyone he saw within a specific no-man's land on either side of the fence. In addition, along the outside perimeter of this no-man's-land, prominent signs proclaimed,<br />\\"STOP - Danger - High-Voltage Electricity.\\"  So that even a dense nine-year old would get the message, a skull and cross-bones were depicted above the inscription.<br /><br />In my view, these basic, verifiable historic facts make the premise of \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" untenable. This book makes a mockery of history.<br /><br />  Peter Kubicek
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|RL prevented me from reading this book when it first came out.  I was dying to get to it, and I was not disappointed!  I loved every stinking thing about this book.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me mad.  The revelations came at just the right time.  Holder will make you swoon; he's the perfect boyfriend.  And Sky is inspiring for her strength. I have the urge to lie down and stargaze. Buy this book now.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|The movie has good imagery, nice costumes, cool concept and darn good tracks throughout the whole movie. Not to mention, it is a good movie for all ages. Highly recommend it.!
0143121006|5.0|Loved this book. A truly haunting historical mystery.  If you have enjoyed the style of Erik Larson's books (The Devil In The White City, In The Garden Of Beasts, Thunderstruck, Isaac's Storm), John Berendt's Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil or Joseph Kanon's novel, Istanbul Passage you should find Midnight In Peking a thoroughly engaging read.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The only reason you should buy the three disc version of this movie is for the movie extras...and I have to say it is loaded with a lot of great entertaining features.  Well worth it for any Trekie!  Go forth and buy.
B0055QYKQO|2.0|The retainers of the RAM slots had broken leaving almost useless the motherboard. This board has a serious problem of quality materials
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Awesome game. Great for long play or for when you have a few minutes to kill. Well worth the time to download!
B004Y042N8|3.0|This app is a very interesting game in that it takes a very simply idea and makes a game out of it, yet it could be very challenging at point, which I loved. After a while I kinda grew tired of the same premise but the extra game modes such as speed challenges really helped me enjoy this game and I totally recommend this game if you like challenging puzzle games.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I really love this album.  I'm new to the Killers scene; only purchasing my first album (Hot Fuss) a month ago- Dec 2012.  I was first introduced to them on YouTube and listened to Mr. Brightside over and over again until I just bought the album.  I don't love Hot Fuss though; it is very, very slowly growing on me, but this album took only about 2 listens for me to love it.  I don't skip any songs, which says a lot.  Althogh \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" is probably my least favorite, there are still parts of it that I enjoy.  I'm trying not to over-play this so I don't get tired of it, but I still listen to it at least twice a day.  I just love it. Besides Miss Atomic Bomb, one of my favorites is The Way It Was, especially the part he sings \\"Elvis singing don't be cruel......\\"<br /><br />So excited about \\"discovering\\" (lol) the Killers; after I get my fill of this I plan of purchasing some of their previous albums.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I am a huge fan of music but generally I prefer to listen to music on my device or through Pandora, however I decided to give this app a chance a a truly enjoy it. Most of the music apps that I have downloaded in the past have not lived up to my expectations however this app has truly amazed me that it allows me to listen to my favorite bands and songs. I especially love being able to tag my favorite songs and saving my favorite stations. This is a great app.
B000W1586S|4.0|I bought this because I love Mr. Brightside so much, but I find the rest of the album just OK. I usually don't listen to the last few songs at all.  I like the newer Killers, I think.  I love their new album; Battle Born.  I've listened to this one at least a dozen times, thinking it will grow on me, but I just don't think I like the style of most of the songs.  I do like the first 6 songs better than the others.<br /><br />Edit 2/22/2013:  I like this album a lot more now; I kept listening to it and it's grown on me.  I actually like all the songs except the last 3, and I really love Change Your Mind and All These Things that I've Done.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Very happy with the product. Will keep in plastic for the future. Obviously I have not  listened to the records so I cannot give a review of the sound quality. Purely an investment.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Cannot wait for the next season.  It is no wonder the series has won so many emmys. Nice replaying of the era represented
B0001I562I|5.0|After searching for this classic movie in DVD edition, I quickly found this one. Shipping was surprisingly fast and item was exactly what I had hoped for!
B0042RJWTC|3.0|On two disks there were skips.  Fortunately, they were on the last two and did not skip over anything crucial to the plot<br />Interesting take on Henry VIII.  Definitely not factual
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It was so easy to download and play. Glad to be able to play games as well as read<br />on my Kindle Fire.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The cast is excellent.  The plot amazing.  The suspense incredible.  Hurry up and send the next season. Definitely emmy material
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The film version of Les Miz was well worth the wait. It is a triumph of emotion, pathos and music, and it's hard to imagine the final product coming together any other way after seeing it.<br /><br />Although this accompanying soundtrack is a heavily truncated highlights album, it does present all the major musical numbers as recorded live for the film. Moreso than most film soundtracks, you're only getting half the story with this one, as without the live visuals to go along with the music it can feel rather incomplete. For those of you who have yet to see the film and have only heard the soundtrack, please don't make any final judgements until you see it. It makes much more sense after you see how each number was photographed and staged.<br /><br />Performance-wise, we're talking solid territory here. It was refreshing to see none of the actors emulating their stage counterparts (and Les Miz is one of the most heavily replicated shows out there) and instead giving their all to create new, fresh interpretations of these legendary roles. No, there's not much in the way of belting here, save for a few choice moments, but none of these actors were directed to give a stage performance. They were giving a filmic performance. Broadway belting would've been totally at odds with Tom Hooper's concept, and the more intimate presentation of the songs doesn't mean they're any less musical. There's no one way a song has to be done, and it was very satisfying to see such an original take on such an established classic.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I decided to give this book a go after reading so many positive reviews and I wasn't disappointed. I'm a big fan of end of the world/apocalypse/zombie fiction and this fit in to that perfectly. It's a great story and a fast read, I definitely recommend it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great program that allows one to access all of the features of ebay from your phone! I especially found it useful to list items and check sold values while on the road.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Buying new weapons and armor is extremely slow and painful, pretty much forcing you to shell out money for upgrades
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I like this game.... it's a lot of fun to play. And it's very addictive. I play it ask the time.
B002M87V0A|4.0|Robert Preston does an excellent job in this true American classic written by Meredith Wilson!  Very true to the original Broadway version.
B004NEY9EW|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and picked up were Casino Royal left off nicely. The car chase in the beginning is great, and has some very dramatic music to go with it. The scene were he is chasing Tanner the &#34;inside assassin&#34; has some phenomenal camera work. The way it follows them off the clock tower, and crash thru the solarium is awesome. I also think that Daniel Craig plays one of the best bonds ever, and doesn't feel so hoaky as the older movies.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Received this two days after I ordered it, and it works just fine. I don't know why people are having issues with it not playing. Works just fine in my Blu Ray player. My husband and I are addicted to this show! A must-have if you like the show!

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading - couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to get back to it.  Tragedy- Triumph- Lufe Journey!
B005FITIK0|5.0|Knowing this type of character and recognizing parts of myself in her too, I thought the screenplay and Charlize delivered a fully realized person, situation and location.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Very current storyline in our world of electronic communications.<br />Great characters who meet by chance in a world full of texting.  Funny and enjoyable read.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is one of my top 5 rated movies.You can't help but smile when you watch it. I bought it used and when I received it it was in GREAT quality.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|i just could not get into it. disjointed because of the time travel theme. actors sucked too. I usually lovethe  sci-fi genre
1881273156|5.0|Awesome book. Everyone could use this book in their library. thanks for sending so quick. Service was on time and welcomed
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The author has succeeded in creating a truly new world and premise-- not an easy task. Very enjoyable read full of mysteries.<br /><br />(not quite a spoiler below)<br /><br />Maybe a star off for not offering more explanation for why the general populace in this book accepts the prevailing dogma so thoroughly.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|If you are a concrete thinker and do not \\"get\\" films made from video games or comic books, nor their intent, then are comments like \\"avoid this trash\\" necessary? Sure, nonsense is probably accurate but this movie is excellent for fans of the genre and of course Milla.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|If you want to sit there scratching your head - this movie is for you. If you think \\"s***\\" on the floor is funny beyond the age of 7 - this is for you. If you think that crude joking that involves complete lack of knowing what is right to say  - this movie is for you.    Personally, I do not think it is funny to make fun of rape, relationships, kidnapping, child abuse and etc.    I am extremely sarcastic and like \\"pushing the boundaries\\" in my humor (hence my like for Family Guy); however, this was beyond  ... it was just tacky and terrible.    Whoever said this was funny must think that SAW series is funny as well. ....
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Good music for the Taylor Swift fan. This is where it all started for Taylor and this is a definite must have
0385535147|3.0|In RACKETEER we again see the familiar Grisham trademark elements, the legal part of which needn't be enumerated. There's the FBI, of course, throwing its considerable weight around and looking above all for good PR. And the locale most familiar to us Grisham readers, the Caribbean.<br /><br />But here again, however, arises Grisham's problem area: finding a satisfying conclusion for his plot. We recall CLIENT, RUNAWAY JURY, PARTNER, BRETHREN and others. Too often there is unresolved tension awaiting the reader on the last page.  Not that spending the rest of one's life keeping a low profile among the Caribbean islands is unappealing, but Grisham has used this ending enough times that those island paradises would be the first place any bounty-hunter or Fed would look. Even a five-star plot like KING OF TORTS ends with the chastened hero scooting out of the US for Europe and a hazy future existence.<br /><br />With John Grisham's stories we must learn to enjoy the chase and not expect much beyond the existentialist ending which cries out for each of us to complete the plot from where the author leaves it: a case of \\"DO try this at home.\\"
0765325950|5.0|Was the book perfectly tight and polished?  No, but who could demand that given the time period.  I'd rather have the book published in a reasonable time than wait years upon years for the author to stew (looking at you GRRM).  Did it tie up every loose end and answer every unanswered question?  No, but after watching Lost, I am forever desensitized to this kind of flaw.  Did it utilize every major character to their fullest potential?  No, it did not.  Given the overabundance of storylines and characters, such a feat would have been more tedious than productive.<br /><br />What this book did was tie up the principal storylines, provide a plausible narrative of the Last Battle, and end in a way that leaves the reader with a smile.<br /><br />Now, we just need to talk Sanderson into abridging books 3-10.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I got to the point with this book that I couldn't put it down at the end. And then came the ending. I had to go back and read it over again because I really couldn't believe that was it. There were so many ways she could have gone with the end and this was the worst of them. Just came off to me as lazy on the part of the author. So sorry I ever bought the book. Don't think I'm at all inspired to read any of her other books. Can't believe that with this ending, the book was even published.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Besides being a little bit gruesome, this story held your interest.  It wasn't until almost the end that the reader knew who was behind everything. This story is not for the meek or timid reader.  It is often very graphic. Still the story was considered exciting and well worth the time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|An enjoyable story with lovable characters.  Written in an original voice.  The kind of book you read with in  a couple of days because you can't stop.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|Battleship(2012) is an action packed science fiction film loosely based on the board game Battleship. American and Japanese naval officers have to fight off an alien invasion. Battleship is a big, expensive, ponderous spectacle. It feels like a big budget Asylum movie or a Michael Bay film. The alien beings that the Battleship crew fights are very one dimensional. This feels like a 1950's style alien invader film made in 2012. Still, this movie is fun if you turn your brain off. The visual effects are solid. The chicken burrito theft scene was funny. It was a shot for shot spoof of a real life liquor store robbery recorded on CCTV. Battleship is packed with product placement. I saw the Subway logo three times. The aliens in the film use giant orbs with razors. The orbs slice through cars, helicopters, bridges and ships. The behind the scenes featurettes on the DVD show us how much money and elbow grease went into making this film. Battleship is worth a rental or watching on late night TV with beer!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very good class warfare piece.  I love them!! Why does this require a certain number of words.  Brevity is the soul of wit!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In her remarks during the Season 3 opener:  this show is addictive!  The plot is always interesting and fast-paced, the acting is top notch, the characters are all believable, and the sets and costumes are just mouth-watering.  The best British import since the Beatles!
B005LAIHE0|4.0|While I did not hate the movie many of my friends really liked it.  I also worked as an extra on this film and had a blast.  All of the actors (except the main one!) were great to work with and I was seen in many spots in the movie.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Definitely a favorite in our home. We love anything to do with super heroes. I guess having a 5 year old boy at home contributes to that. Great movie. Always provides entertainment.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|its not that bad in fact it is awesome- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
B005IZLPMY|5.0|My son is obsessed with super heroes in general, but especially loves all the avengers characters in their own individual movies. And, of course I love them too. lol
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book starts out like any other book, a little slow. When you get to the actual &#34;Operation Redwing&#34; you better be ready to read for a while. I could not put the book down! This is a very intense book!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hoover has written a beautiful book about two very complex and damaged souls. Her attention to detail is flawless and connects the reader to both Sky and Holder. As a result, the reader experiences a gamut of emotions from laughing out loud, shedding a few tears, anxiety - definitely a moment or two that you feel uncomfortable, and maybe even a blush or two.<br /><br />Sky is a difficult character from the beginning of the book. It is easy to see that she is trying to overcome some personal issues even before they are revealed. After meeting Holder, she is somewhat similar to a butterfly going through the transformation process.<br /><br />Holder is INTENSE!! There is a depth to this young man from the very beginning that offers the opportunity to make him into an amazing character and Hoover does. Holder is perfect. Holder would make one heck of a man!!<br /><br />The intense physical connection between Holder and Sky is written beautifully. This is definitely a story line that can survive whatever trends of the moment. This one is timeless.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|3 D affects were great, good acting,good Si Fi,...but story line to much like Aliens ...unless your an Aliens fan...then you will love this movie.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Came in great condition! It is a very gripping imaginative movie! I love the whole series! Love the vampires and werewolves!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the book.  The characters were typical romanace characters.  He's rich, mysterious, wanting a relationship on his terms.  She's successful, honest, and wanting real love.  It was easy to read and enjoyable.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Best of the Batman movie with action.  However, can't beat the one with the Joker.<br />More Cat woman would be great in the next one too.
B0007TKNII|2.0|Honestly, if they are going to make a movie about a masked man - why did they just not use Michael Crawford instead of a man who can not sing! For heaven's sake, I never saw such a stupid set of casting than in this film!
B003YUQAM0|5.0|Very lightweight and comfortable.  I've been wearing classic Van's forever.  These are a nice alternative.  I love the material Crocs uses for their sole/inside.  Soft and squishy, but not overly.  My Crocs version of the Converse Hi-tops are the most comfortable shoes I own.
1401307450|5.0|My opionion will be a bit one sided (being a long time red hot chilli peppers fan) this book is a must read. One of those books you just cant put down. Its hard to believe that guy is still alive.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|The first is that I naively thought that probably I could use it with my Kindle fire but unfortunately that was not the case. But with my other kindle works very good.I need to read texts in German and it is necessary for me to know the accurate meaning of the words and with the kindle it is a great tool. Wonderful!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is great and worth it. This book is so exciting. Suzanne Collins is a great author and that's it.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It had a really interesting story line.  I love the use of symbolism and conspiracy as is Dan Brown's MO. I especially loved that it took place in Washington DC. However I was a little disappointed.  It felt like there was a lot of repeated information, maybe you could call it filler or too much, over the top explanation.  And it was more predictable than I expected.  Still I was eager to read it and finished quickly, (wondering if I was right) and that, to me, says \\"worth the read.\\"
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Tried to give a glimpse of the plot to my hubby and could not begin without getting emotional. I absolutely loved it, and hated it( since I'm still devastated-ly touched by it ).  As so many reviewers stated JUST READ IT...but have tissues handy.....soft ones you will need them!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was very skeptical at first after people were telling me what it was about. Never thought I'd be interested in this storyline but it was addicting.
B003Q6D1Z6|5.0|Great movie, my girlfriend and I watched it on our first date! We were hooked from start to finish. There was nothing phoney about this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book. I read it in 2 days and absolutely loved it! I did not want it to end!
B00722ZHG6|4.0|Came just like you would buy it in stores but half the price. Really a terrific value. money well spent
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book! Never thought I'd be interested in a book like this but it is definitely one of my favorites. I only wish there was more!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All the books in this trilogy were great. I have read historical romances with more sex in them, these were not over done. I loved each one of them.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina Fey. She's so honest and hilarious it makes you not able to put the book down. I hope she writes more
B001NLL93W|5.0|Awesome read!!!!!!!!!!! Could not put them down!!!! If u have not read these books, you should!!!! Two big thumbs up!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I LOVE Nicholas Sparks! This book is no expception to his amazing collection. I have all of his books and I love all of them. Just waiting for more to come out!
B00005JPSM|4.0|Catherine in this one, and how much tension there was between her and the male lead. It doesn't hurt either that she's in a chef's jacket (I love women in chefs jackets, think they're pretty hot in them).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book and i cannot wait until the 3rd book comes out! Fast delivery right to my kindle!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love this album.  Such a refreshing sound.  Love that they write their own music.  Been on repeat ever since I purchased it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books have become a phenomenon! I loved all 3 of them and only wish there was more. Great series!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is superb in every way -- character casting, period costumes, period automobiles, period reconstruction of a village, and exceptionally fine actors. The plot is somewhat soap-operish, but it is gripping nonetheless. The BBC is an international jewel, and PBS is a fine fellow for screening it here.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I have yet to finish this book. I love Nicholas Sparks but this is the only book of his that i keep putting down. Just can't get into it.
0316227706|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for a pair of dog fanatics!  They absolutely loved it!  Great pictures showing unique personalities and funny faces!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Twilight is my all time favorite series. Breaking dawn was the best book out of all of them. Definitely recommended
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is my favorite holiday movie of all, it is so funny and brightens the holidays even more  Just tops
B009JBZH54|5.0|I am happy with this product. Great quality and great movies. I have always been a fan and this brings all three movies plus more.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|casual fans of star trek will love this new interpretation. the story itself is good the special effects are top tier and amazing
0870703781|3.0|If you have other Eggleston photo books this is apparently  mainly a collection of photos from other books, according to the person I gave it to who returned it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an awesome point and click adventure w/not a obnoxious amount of hidden object scenes. There is a storyline which is very good and everything flows perfectly. Graphics are stellar and game length is great. Worth every bit of $ now if you don't want to wait for it to drop. Keep ones like this coming G5!!!
B001GMH8TM|5.0|This is probably in my top 5 all-time favorite movies. For some reason it just resonates with me. Jim Carrey knocks it out of the park. If you watch this product you should be able to purchase the Blu-ray for less than $8 at certain times throughout the year.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Ok,  I don't like knocking these guys because G5 typically has awesome point and click/hidden object adventures w/great storylines....however,  this one---eh, not so great. The dialogue boxes and dialogue itself was intrusive and annoying. The storyline was also dull and to be honest, boring.  The game as a whole was ok...but wait for the price drop to $.99 or free for this one people.
B001S86J5S|5.0|I am from Cleveland so I might be biased but this movie is amazing! The thing most Clevelanders can tell you is this is pretty much how we think our teams behave. Sports movies like this arn't made anymore!<br /><br />&#34;This guy threw at his own son in a father son game.&#34;
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Amazing how the book brings everything full circle.  It truly makes u think about how sometimes we turn into what we fear most.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game my wife plays for hours she has it on Kindle Fire and never stops playing it she loves the game.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I've enjoyed all of the Dan Brown books that I've read. This one falls in the middle somewhere. Overall, a good read.
B0027MJU00|2.0|The story sounded interesting but the ending was more graphic than I expected.  I'd read Ms. Flynn's newest book and did enjoy the story and her composition.  However if I had read Dark Places first, it would have taken a lot of convincing to get me to purchase another book by this author.  I read to relax and find enough tragic violence in real life, I don't need to spend my quality time immersed in it.  The story line may revolve around a tragedy, even a violent one, but I'd prefer the graphic details kept to my imagination.  I am now on the fence about her other book which I put on my wish list at the same time as Dark Places because I did enjoy Gone Girl.  That said, the first two thirds of this story moved along at a mildly slow pace, revealing characters and setting up suspects but never really letting you get to know two of the three main characters and that left me a little flat and waiting for a riveting ending.  But, as I stated, the last third of the book was just violent and sloppy and actually had such a far-fetched ending that it bordered on the ridiculous rather than giving me any sense of a satisfactory ending.  I don't need happy endings, I wouldn't expect one from this storyline, but it just went in the wrong direction for me and two stars is a gift.
B0053O89U6|5.0|I love this show so much! Cant wait until the fourth season is out!<br />I got the package 2-3 days after ordering it, I am very satisfied.
1451627297|5.0|A very good read!  I couldn't put this book down for very long--keeps your attention and you want to keep reading.
B00845PV16|1.0|This movie does not even make the B-list, it goes strait to the D (for dumpster) list.<br />It is a waste of time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie and was told a lot was missing from the book. So I wanted to find out for myself. The beginning and middle were very similar but the ending of the book explained a lot more than the movie showed. I liked the book and really want to continue reading the set. I can't wait to get the next one.
B007PPE086|5.0|My niece collects these dolls and was so happy to get a black and white of Frankie Stein it was really cool. A well made doll also.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I Love to mix and find soothing tones for my ears to listen to. I enjoy it even  more now with new head Phones.
B007EECSFA|4.0|THE ENDING WAS SUCH A SURPRISE!!  THIS BOOK WAS WELL<br />WRITTEN, AND HAD SUCH GREAT CHARACTERS. I WOULD<br />RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO MY BOOKWORM FRIENDS.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|It was a great ending to this series! I recommend reading this series if you are interested in post apocalyptic type stories.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector is typical Jack Clancy: a techno-thriller from beginning to end.  It made my stay in the hospital zoom by.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Beautiful read loved it, full of emotion and motivation and a great Christian testimony. If your military or not, read this!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app is great! Works every time. It also has many small features that normally you wouldn't think about. :-)
B00A09VWVW|1.0|This book causes my phone to freeze up and crash every time I load it into my kindle app. It also has no active table of contents and has strange formatting beginning at the part where the \\"general theory\\" starts. Instead of the usual white background with print that stretches across the screen, the pages of the general theory appear as thin blue columns. The book is so buggy that I found myself unable to read it and will now have to purchase a different version.
0064430227|4.0|Even after reading the great reviews, I wasn't sure my 3yo would like this, but I got it anyway. He loves this book and sometimes wants it read repeatedly. It is a great journey for the imagination of little ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Incredibly beautiful and inspiring. As the mother of two with a congenital disorder- though not life threatening- this book reminded me how precious life is, and how kids that face these bad cards know it better than all.
B00A757EFW|5.0|this brings backk the good ol' times. it's fun and very great to play. i love it! you will to if you love pac man
B001O3UJ8K|5.0|if it aint broke. It aint me -banga I been wanting to add this to my vault. I listen to it as soon as I could!
B000008M1P|5.0|since i have found this girl group a couple of years ago i thought they were awsome. i really love this cd and plan to buy their others.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|A nice quirky science fiction with a few twists that keep you guessing. Enjoyed it way more than I thought I would
0345803507|5.0|I love this series. The writing style may leave a lot to be desired but the story itself is amazing. Love, love, love it.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I found it very difficult to understand what was being said as they made the &#34;Scottish&#34; accent a &#34;wee bit too much&#34; in my opinion.  The story line left a bit to be desired as well.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Me Before You is a well written story.  Jojo Moyes finds humor and true life in some expected places. I read this for our book club and I'm glad I live in the British Virgin Islands as more of the British sayings and ways rang true.  Very inspiring.
B009DA74ES|5.0|so far it keeps up the tradition of outrageous and funny relationships among the characters. we've watched half the season and it keeps us interested just as the previous seasons did. we love this show!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The cover for the Kindle is too small and will have to be returned but it arrived quickly and in excellent condition
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Original Nikon Lens hood at a fraction of the Nikon price. No moving patrs to worry about like the horrid HB-57 Nikon Lens hood.<br />Hope I don't lose this one!
B0045D3N3O|5.0|Great addition to my collection, very fast shipper, and exactly what was described in its description.  Cant wait to show off to all my friends.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is a laugh out loud movie....just really funny......Mark Wahlberg can do no wrong.  Just make sure there are no young kids around because there is definitely plenty of in appropriate scenes for young ears and eyes.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  I tend really like Robin Williams in more serious roles.  Great story, very moving -- leaves you wanting more.  HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I was very satisfied with this DVD set. The movie was excellent due to its open ended story line, strong acting, and special effects. The behind the scenes documentary was excellent. I was amazed to see how much work went into this film and to see how Ridley Scott bucked the CGI trend by building actual sets and taking advantage of cutting edge make up and 3-D cameras. The DVD set is a great value.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|One of my new favorites! So different than any other Disney movies out there. Such an empowering movie for young girls and families alike.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This is one of the best shows that I watch outside of the walking dead. Everything about this show is awsome!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|This book had very little entertainment value and no literary value. I don't know why people read books written by Stephen King.  I know this was my last.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|This is a fun novelty. It connects to your iPad via Bluetooth and is pretty responsive. As a controller, the ergonomics are all wrong, and it only works with a handful of Gameloft games but you're not exactly buying this thing for hard core gaming anyway.<br /><br />I tried it with Brothers in Arms 2 and I have to say the pad and buttons are so much nicer to use that the non-tactile virtual controller on the iPad's glass screen!<br /><br />For added fun, here's a little tip: get this and an [[ASIN:B007I5JT4S Apple TV]], use AirPlay Mirroring on your iPad 2 (or newer iOS device) and you can play iPad games on your TV using the controller! Pretty cool!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely love this book and can't wait for the movie! Great story of overcoming fear and finding your way to a new life.....
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Good movie . Great super heroes except the Black Widow , Scarlet Johanssen was not a good choice . Chris Hemmingsworth was great as Thor
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Some parts seemed almost like the same thing when it came to love scenes but I guess that is just life.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|... but it is a fun film. I'd rank it between Skyfall and Casino Royale in terms of quality. Not a deep storyline in my opinion, and the characters could have been better fleshed out, but it was as exciting as it was supposed to be. A masterful bout of chase scenes!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is the best game yet.it allows you destroy mankind in fun ways.my favorite is the prion desies.it is definitely worth the 99&cent;
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest is awesome and addicting , but this app is a little slow sometimes, overall i love it and i use it a lot
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is large but totally worth the read. It had a little bit of romance a little bit of humor and a whole lot of action and adventure. It's really good because it has a great story, ending, and there's a big story and reason behind this book.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|all your favorite songs right in your kindle, love it, i am very glad i downloaded this app, get it now
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Its one of the best shows I have seen.  Core Values that teach responsibility and honor with American Spirit.  A work ethic that allows you to know when its time to take a calculated risk and push yourself to your limit.  Some real loyalty is shown in the crosshairs of decision.  How to beat your own demons.  Wholesome Entertainment.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This was the best book if the series so far. It was really good and descriptive with lots of cliffhangers
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When the series first started, I thought it looked boring.  But I've been watching it in re-runs and now I'm hooked.<br /><br />In episode 3, the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) delivers some zingers, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) saves the day, and Bates' murder plot develops.  But poor Edith.  Will she ever get happiness?  Another fine episode.  I missed watching Sunday night and couldn't wait until it came on-line, so I bought the episode.  Well worth it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a fun game - very much like Pictionary but now waste of paper ;).  We all have fun with it in our house - from ages 6 thru 43.  It's fun to find friends and challenge them.  We have a great time with this game.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I got this for my 10-year-old son. He likes building the stuff for the piggies and the challenge of getting the inventions. However, he does not like the ads. I guess this is a trade-off for the free price tag. He seems to enjoy it a lot.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is my favorite of all the creepy point and click puzzle games. I can't wait for part 2!  The story line assent cheesy and th graphics were beautiful. It was really interactive and I enjoyed how much stuff I got to pick up and use in unusual ways.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|When I heard him speak on his experience on TV - it was interesting as any NDE.  That is why I purchased his book.  When I was reading it I wondered about the experiences he had as what a Christian would or should have.  But I thought well that was his experience and how could I say he did not have it.  Then I read some of the reviews from people that read the rebuttal by Robert King and I decided to read his book.  After reading his book and being a Christian, I thought his views were correct and that he was not attacking Dr. Alexander but just stating what the Bible stated as he understands it.  I think the reviews on Robert Kings book were very harsh.  As if he did not have a right to state his opinion. I would not recommend Dr. Alexander book to anyone.  I just hope that after Dr. Alexander's experience that he understands now there is life after death and he will need to make a decision where he would like to spend eternity.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin does not disapoint with the 5th novel in this series. I cannot wait for the 6th book to come out!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I admit, I am not a big Angry Birds fan, and have tried many of the various permutations of the game.  This edition essentially integrates the best of each version.  And who doesn't love a good Star Wars music blast every once and again??  The Luke Skywalker character even has a little light saber that you can activate by clicking the screen to blast through stuff.  Wonderfully done.  This is the only Angry Birds game that I ever really use anymore.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Churned-out cash in sequel, right? Nah, it's pretty good. Overlong maybe, and somewhat disjointed. But it's smarter than you'd think. And trying to figure out just how RDJ manages to convince us he is anyway near appropriate casting for this part continues to be half the fun.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams is in it just long enough to make you wonder why she wasn't in the whole darn thing. Jude Law is...well, he's in this movie. Maybe they'll make better use of both of them in the next one.<br /><br />That I just typed that last sentence is this movie's biggest success. Fun. Enough.
B004A8ZWWY|4.0|This is a pretty decent comedy, with a very good, unusual cast. Eddie Murphy is actually pretty funny in this movie, and its nice to see him stick to just one role. Ben Stiller is at about his normal, I wish he would kind of step out of his safe zone sometimes and just go for it.<br /><br />This isn't an action movie, it is straight up comedy with a heist at the end, but it definitely works. Even the heist is hilarious. It is really great to get to see the normal people try to get one over on the wealthy. Its like getting back all the major corporations, that are stealing from the normal people and don't think twice about it, so it really kind of hits home on that level, so this movie is a little deeper than most comedies, so that's what I think makes it stand out a little more than most comedies.<br /><br />Overall this is a really decent comedy, though I am not sure it is something you will be drawn to watch over and over. It is funny and does deserves the for stars, but there just doesn't seem to have that special something to it, like Step Brothers has, so I would say rent this one.
B007XF0X6G|5.0|The 3D is this movie is 100 times better than the 3D in Clash of the Titans. The depth is spot on throughout the whole movie, I read a few reviews that talked about some of the scenes in Hades being hard to see, but I had absolutely no problem with it on my Samsung. There are quite a few great pop out scenes, at all depths, you get embers floating out of the screen, then you have stuff fly right past you, its great, they did a wonderful job of spreading them out and having then at different distances, it adds alot to the experience. You can definitely see they learned from their mistakes on Clash.<br /><br />The movie itself is an all out, balls to the wall, kick ass movie. The fight scenes are great and Sam Worthington does a incredible job, and takes quite a few beatings in this movie.The CGI is perfect and beautiful, it was really well done. The gods are alot more involved in this movie, which really makes this movie stand above Clash, because they aren't just sitting back watching stuff unfold, in this one they are thrown in middle of it all.<br /><br />Overall this movie definitely lives up to its name, after watching it, in 3D especially, you feel like you have felt the Wrath of the Titans! If you have a 3D setup I would say this is a must see and a must add to your collection, no doubt about it. If 3D is not your thing, this is still a must see movie.
B009XTF8JM|3.0|This movie had SO much potential. After Raimis work on Drag Me to Hell I was pumped to see this movie, only to be kind if let down. Its not all Raimis fault. First off he didn't direct this, he only produced it. Secondly there was something  like 14 other producers. So with that in mind you really can't lay to much blame on him. The blame, in my opinion falls on the shoulders of Ole Bornedal, who I personally have never heard of and have never seen or heard of, any of his previous movies.<br /><br />The movie just seems rather slow. There are a few scares but nothing really new, though the kitchen scene with the mother and the morgue scene were intense. The actress who played the possessed girl did a wonderful job, she can show so much emotion with just her eyes, and I really wish they would of given her more to work with, because she can make herself look so evil, but at the same time you can still tell that there is this innocent young girl trapped in this body, it is really remarkable. I could just imagine what she could have done with a role like the exorcist, and I am not dishing on the exorcist, but I am saying if she would of had a role like that it could of really put her on the map. Unfortunately this movie isn't going to do that for her, but I truly believe she has enormous potential and I look forward to seeing her in the future.<br /><br />Overall I say if you really have to see this rent it first. If your a person who doesn't watch many horror movies you will probably really enjoy it, but you seasoned horror movie vets, won't find anything new and fresh here.
0765325950|5.0|With 900+ pages of continuous action this was a strange read, but well worth it in the end. Some plot lines ends a bit too convenient and all the characters are a bit too heroic always doing the \\"right\\" thing. However, thinking about the complexity of ending another writers vision, I could not ask for more. Very very hard to put down (not much sleep the last week) and the feeling of losing something when the book ends, are all signs of a great read. So kudos to Mr Sanderson and thank you very much.<br /><br />HFusdahl<br />PS. Will not give a bad rating because of it, but the choice of not doing an ebook (until April) was a terrible bad decision.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Headphones with earbuds don't work well for me. They always fall out. I've had other Sony headphones in the past (with a jointed headband - those were great!) which all lasted at least a year. These are OK. They fit fine, but the headband part feels very flimsy. I don't predict a long life for these.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game is original and very enjoyable.  I love the graphics!  The fat cat and the cute mouse.how much more do I have to say!
B0070YDOT8|3.0|Do not download this game unless you plan on spending your own money to play this is a very fun and addictive game but you never gain I lose more chips then i gain had to buy chips 3 differant times just to keep playing thats not fair if their were bigger prizes and you won a little more I would give it 5 stars but untill then I think this game will be deleted soon : (
B0059F7I24|5.0|This album deserved 5 stars in my book for one simple reason: it satisfies all my criteria for what I consider the best melodic metalcore. It has excellent screaming and it has great clean vocals, in just about equal proportions. Instrumentation is straight forward and totally rocks. Every song hits hard. There are no songs on the album that I would prefer to skip.<br /><br />I recommend this album to anyone who holds dear All That Remains' &#34;Fall of Ideals&#34; and Killswitch Engage's &#34;As Daylight Dies,&#34; particularly two of my favorite songs: Six (ATR) and My Curse (KSE). If you're looking for more of that, this album is what you want.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was moved by the language of this book.  It is not at all what I expected but I am still thinking about it.  I am still pondering the ending and wondering which version I believe.  I think one of the big lessons of this book is as long as you know your own truth nothing else matters.  It's between you and God.  This will probably be a book that I go back a read again.
B009A9EQL6|3.0|but my gf is a diehard aerosmith fan so what do you expect.  if you like aerosmith than purchase this version comes with cool stuff
B001H5X7KC|5.0|one of the funniest movies ive seen.  i recommend watching with sub titles so you can catch every little joke
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read a number of Ken Follett's books and have found them all very enjoyable.  They tend to be long complex tales that require the reader's attention to detail and subtle plot shifts.  I am looking forward to reading more of his books.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The first half is funny and exciting, the second half is incredibly intense.  Character development is thorough and appealing - although, despite his indisputable status as The Perfect Boyfriend, Holder's speeches were a bit over-the-top.  Regardless, Hoover is a wonderful writer and the story is amazing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved this video.  I  cant wait to see the season 2! I am hooked on it. Interesting characters! Great storylines.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the way this story worked out and I hope they make a few more in this manner.
B0000AOV85|4.0|If your really a fan then you will enjoy this and maybe want a little more. Most of this I already knew but it was a nice reminder that all good things come to an end, one way or another.  One last show would be nice but would it be the same. Eagles pulled it off, Moody Blues came very close so maybe it's better that they don't.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Storyline, characters, and costumes are the best I have seen in a long time. Takes you back to a different time, to a different place. Intriguing.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Bought this to add to my holiday collection and watched it several times. Forgot how funny this and the original were
B007IXWKUK|5.0|BOUGHT ALL THREE INT HE SERIES FOR MY WIFE AND FOUND MYSELF READING THE FIRST ONE THEN PROCEED TO READ THE NEXT TWO. IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD BOOK AND AN EASY READ....WARNING, NOT FOR CHILDREN!!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book provides a detailed inside look of what a Navy SEAL goes through to earn their pin and it's way worse than I even imagined. Additionally what the author and his fellow SEALs went through for the sake of Operation Redwing was beyond comprehension. Only a SEAL to could deal with what they did. HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone wanting to begin to understand what these men go through for our freedom.........
0525953728|4.0|The ending of this book is much better than the beginning or middle. I acknowledge being a SEAL is a tough and honorable job, but a lot of this book seems to be an autobiography of Mr. Owen. The blow by blow details of the mission to get Bin Laden is gripping. You can easily put yourself in that compound along with the SEALS. It was nice to hear the story from someone who was actually there because news reports are often erroneous and sensationalized.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I liked this movie because it delved into the origins of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. It was not cartoonish like the previous series of Batman movies had become. After the first batman with Jack Nicholson, it was all downhill for Tim Burton. I highly recommend this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enthralled from the beginning!<br />Can't wait to start on the next book in the series.  And now to watch the movie.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|I wanted a light weight protector for my Kindle so I could carry in my purse. I only needed something to protect the screen and did not want anything bulky. My Kindle fits perfectly. I would recommend this to a friend.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I think its the best option only if you bought a lot of amazon mp3 music<br /><br />I really prefer Google Play Music
0786955570|4.0|Its a pretty good starter set for anyone who want to start D&D aventures<br />The basic mecanics is there but i think i actually need the expansion set
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Original story you'll love it. It's a perfect movie for todays society as the story rather stereotypes the rich from the poor.<br />Excellent story & original!
B006YC74E8|3.0|...however it is cumbersome. Certain actions take you completely out of the program, other areas can not be reached. For the price, it is a good program but improvements are needed.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|So I'm not actually a small child, but for some reason I'm very sensitive to violence in movies. I can't count the number of times I've had to stop movies or leave the room because people get shot up or cut up or tortured or burned or whatever. I don't take it very well. This severely limits my entertainment options, since I appreciate a great story with well developed characters and an intriguing plot, I just cannot stomach lots of gore.<br /><br />I'm happy I watched Super 8 because it's an exciting and enjoyable movie where you can still feel suspense without being shown bodies as they're ripped apart. I love that. Also, the friendship is lovely between all the boys + Elle's character. Watch this movie for a good time. Not perfect, but a lovely escape.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|A Movie so &#34;well done&#34;, with Intrigue, Reality and Compassion that will inspire you to be a better person. Everyone on this Earth should see this film based on true events.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|a wonderful read full of plot and colourful characters, history, and a real tear jerker - ladies have the tissues ready!
B009MO5G90|4.0|I didn't like Extinction and now I love it<br />I didn't like Afterlife and now I love it<br />I didn't like Retribution and I know I will love it when part 6 comes out<br /><br />Comprende?<br /><br />Milla, please don't stop making these films.<br /><br />And yes I plan on getting the 3d version. Mila in 3d is awesome!
B0025UHKNS|3.0|The bezel is a pain.  Not the hardest thing to learn how to use it- but poorly designed so that it is a hassle.  I'd pick a different Garmin watch.  Picked this one b/c my 305 broke.  I like the size better- but the bezel design is foolish.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Very Fun and Easy Game to Play. The Graphics are Great. Love the Story line. Worth being App of the Day.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|What can I really say, this is just a great game.  I've always enjoyed playing board games, but it's been tough to find one that my dad actually enjoyed and so we never really got to have a family game night.  He recently came across a great website about board games (boardgamegeek.com if you're curious) and when he saw that there was so many more games out there than the usual ones he decided to give board games another try.  So we bought this as a Christmas present for the family and it has been a huge hit!<br /><br />If you're just looking at this game for the first time it probably doesn't sound to exciting; it's just basically trading various resources such as bricks and wool and trying to get to 10 victory points first.  But believe me it's just so much fun to play.  My sister is a typical 18 year old teenage girl and she thought she would thought the game looked boring before she played, but then after her first game she wanted to play again!<br /><br />It's not a real difficult game and you'll probably pick up the rules during your first play through.  Now with that being said, there's definitely a strategy to this game, and you'll need to approach every game differently  since the board can be set up randomly.<br /><br />Speaking of the board, I know some reviews mentioned that the board was somewhat difficult to set up, but so far I have yet to have an issue at all.  The quality of the board and the pieces certainly isn't elite, but you can tell it's well made.<br /><br />Really, if you're looking for a very fun board game to play don't hesitate to purchase this!
B005LAII1C|5.0|i ordered this movie for my hubby for Christmas and he loved it! i actually did too...very funny...great couples movie
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! This book is all about survival and you have to have a good education on animals of land and sea and scientific stuff. Wonderful story for all ages. I'm 11 and I got the chance to read the amazing Life of Pi
0446580848|5.0|\\"The Panther\\" was fantastic!  I've enjoyed all of DeMille's John Corey novels, but I think this one takes the cake.<br /><br />Here, Corey and his wife Kate are strongly encouraged to travel to Yemen to help capture or kill the terrorist who is thought to be the mastermind behind the USS Cole attack back in 2000.  (He's also an American citizen, which puts an interesting kink into the mission.)  They are assisted by members of the CIA, which is always an interesting addition in DeMille's stories.  There are multiple twists and turns throughout the book and of course Corey's making wise-cracks all along the way.  DeMille also brings in another recurring character--Paul Brenner, from \\"The General's Daughter\\" and \\"Up Country.\\"  There was enough respect, and tension, between Brenner and Corey to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Of all the recurring characters I read (Flynn's Mitch Rapp, Preston/Child's Pendergast, Coes' Andreas, etc.) I think DeMille's John Corey has been the one I like the best.  Maybe it's his very non PC attitude, his sarcasm (which is always good for a chuckle), and his competence, but he doesn't seem to become tiring to me.  But maybe most importantly, there's always a reason for him to be doing what he's doing (unlike the more recent John Wells books by Alex Berenson).<br /><br />If you're a fan of DeMille's prior Corey books, do not hesitate to read \\"The Panther.\\"
B0058VW36U|2.0|How do I get the game in English? Would love to play, but is in a language I don't know! Newbie

B005LJKEXS|5.0|Great price, fast shipping, good quality on USB with repeater, needed for pole barb to reach outside world, this is second one, last one lasted 8 months...
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My eife and I have become captivated by the series so much so that we made sure we were ready when season three began.
0142419303|1.0|This is a pop-up book, not the actual novel. This should be advertised much more prominently in the main item heading, or even in the sub-headings. (it is only mentioned at the end of the longer text description). Disappointed.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|IT STAYS WITH THE PROGRAM. THERE ARE TIMES YOU WANT TO JUST JUMP IN AND HELP. IT ALSO TEACHES YOU LESSON IN LIFE. ONE WHY OR ANOTHER. YOU WILL ENJOY IT.
B000059MEK|5.0|My son is a Daft Punk fan & loves this CD. He had a copy when he was younger , but lost it, he was so happy to get this on Christmas.<br />I am happy Amazon had it available.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|THE KIDS LOVE THIS GAME, NO MATTER WHAT VENUE: NABI, COMPUTER, PS3... THEY EVEN BUILD LEGO SCENES IMITATING THIS GAME.
0446580848|2.0|I've been a big Demille fan and have read all his previous novels. The Panther is not in the same class as the earlier ones. There are 600+ pages of supposedly witty and sarcastic asides only thinly interspersed with characters and a story line. I kept pushing through to the end hoping something interesting might develop but sadly no improvements were forthcoming. I found it very tedious to read. I'll give it 2 stars since I did actually finish it - one star is reserved for those that I can't. I got The Panther from the library so can be thankful that I didn't have to pay anything for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing sequel to the hunger games. I'm excited to read book 3. Kept my interest the entire way through. Amazing good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I mainly chose this book because it was free. I found I really enjoyed it. It was witty and cute. Now if only this could happen to all of us life would be a lot easier haha
B00AAX68HG|4.0|adults-- it remains a moderate challenge to get 3 stars per level; kids (ages 6 and up) it's an equivalent challenge just to get through the levels. fun. cute. not violent. not a stressful beat-the-clock kind of game.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My 9 year old and I LOVE it......no violence, imaginative, etc......awesome game!! Wish they had more out like this. Thanks
B001VFTYWI|5.0|Last Precinct just adds to the &#34;following&#34; of the Scarpetta's adventures. The story picks up from the previous book,Black Notice, and enhances the adventure for the reader. And her niece, Lucy, adds just the right intrigue for the story's continuing plot from previous adventures.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|like I said in the title, this app is the best!  I always play it with my sister and its just my favorite app! I totally reccomend it!
B00338QENI|5.0|A very explicit as well as informative look at a real person.....with the history of Ms.Lacks as well as the technical information; and the outcome-all together what turned an otherwise boring story into the insite of one's own possibilty of actually profiting from the knowledge obtained from just one person's life and contrabution, though not intentially-contribution(s) for every person on earth.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Addictive game! Paid version much better than free one. The only thing I would change would be choice of tiles. The Chinese ones mess with your eyes.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|So beautiful... it has me singing along on a daily basis and I never tire of the songs. Every one is a gem!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the Walking Dead series. I am hooked. Have a hard time waiting to see the next episode. One of the best series yet!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I am a science teacher and this device helps me a great deal.  The display is terrific and it has the functions I need to calculate answers.
B006CLTFP2|5.0|If you like the music from the show then you will love this cd, good price, well worth the money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game its so fun. I love  it but its very addictive. The only thing i would change is having the puzzle pieces more often. It takes too long for these puzzle pieces to appear. Also maybe not having the gutters, having those blocked. Other than that i really enjoy playing this game.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Read all Larssen's books, and I have seen the movie once.  I wanted my own copy, and for my husband to see it.<br />I enjoyed the story very much and the character of Lisbeth Salander and the actress' interpretation.  I always get<br />great service from Amazon--my order comes in a timely fashion and exactly what I ordered.  Never have to worry<br />about returns.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was amazing but after reading the others I expected this book to be better but good job Jeff kinney
0547884591|2.0|Let me begin by saying, like most self-help books, there are some useful nuggets within the pages of this book.  But you have to sift through everything else to find them and this book has way too much everything else and very little reward for the effort.<br /><br />I think the author could have used a serious editor and I will just briefly list some of the reasons I did not care for this book.<br /><br />The number one reason is the cooking here is all 'Slow-Carb' recipes based on the author's weight-loss book.  Promising me I can cook like a Professional chef and then dumbing down Osso Bucco and substituting lamb or making scrambled eggs with 2 eggs and 4 yolks is NOT even close to professional.  His whole point is that he dislikes complicated recipes, so much of the book is about him simplifying a recipe and then recording it in his own new twitter style short-hand.  It doesn't make the recipe any easier it just alters the style of most traditional recipes and leaves out exactly the flavor intensifying steps that a professional chef takes the time to do.<br /><br />The name dropping.  Really, you hung out with [insert name of chef I've never heard of] for 5 hours at his restaurant [I've also never heard of] and drank how many bottles of wine while consuming one of everything on the menu? The implication is that deep secrets of these sanctified kitchens will be revealed but I am still waiting.<br /><br />After spending pages talking about his pet peeve with other cookbooks and the expensive list of specialized equipment they require, his own 'advanced' list includes a Vitamix blender and an Induction element.<br /><br />The wordy tangents:  Survivalist cooking, Learning Japanese [the big break through came when the author found a poster with the Japanese alphabet on it.  Really, you need to learn the alphabet to learn a language?  I am shocked.],Binging on a 20 scoop ice cream Sunday after talking to some world champion speed eaters, and the list goes on.<br /><br />I don't understand the 1,000 positive reviews at all.  Save your money.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Recipes are fun. Like designing the restaurant. Don't like that after a certain level you have to have neighbors to expand. Or that you can't add more appliances when you want. Some of the designing parts are difficult to rearrange. But it's fun for what it is....Will not be buying extra gems. Learned my lesson from another app...
B003L77GH4|4.0|This was on a family member's wish list and it made that person very happy. Not on the list of shows I watch.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|I seem to remember a movie of this title, but couldn't quite remember how it unfolded. Anyway, the book was gripping and I quickly put any thoughts about the movie behind me. The ending had a great twist and left me kinda exhausted.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Not my personal choose but made a good present for followed the series. Filler words now follow to finish requirement.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and we were both delighted with the entire set. It was way better than anything we had hoped for! The coffee table book is a lovely collectors piece filled with fun insights from David Lean and Peter O'Toole on making the movie. And the blu-ray was ASTOUNDING! The film looks spectacular - like it was always meant to be seen this way. With every new scene we were blown away by the fantastic restoration. It is breathtaking. This box set is a must own for any fan.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I love the movie Pitch Perfect and having the sound track mobel is so cool. But i do wish they would have put some of the bad aingers in there too. It is what made it funny. But the extra verse of my personal favorite &#34;Cups&#34; won me over.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Easy to read and an interesting story.  You will enjoy it.  Moves along quickly.  On to the next book now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Title says it all. The puzzel start out simple and get harder the higher the level number is . I feel that the game is very addictive so be ready to Love it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is good for the adolescent to read. It can tell teenagers how to adjust themselves everytime a problem appears or a chance is coming. However, I don't think it is good for adults to read since the book don't have a deep analysis.
1423140605|5.0|My son has devoured all of the books in the Rick Riordan Heroes of Olympus series.  This was a great gift to add to his collection, and priced better than retail stores.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show was so addictive.  I could have watched it for free but I would have had to wait 2 weeks and I couldn't wait!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I was disappointed in the plot or lack thereof.  It was not interesting.  I would not recommend the book to my friends. I love using my Kindle Touch.  I have read more, faster for entertainment than any other time in my life.  I have used the Kindle for about 60 days.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The price was great for this one too (i bought part 1 also).  Is a bit shorter than the previous movies but is the great ending to a great series.  Very enjoyable!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed this book; it gave insight to the basic human condition, while allowing me to put my own interpretation and spin on the various characters and situations.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|If you like this series, this in my opinion is the best one!  The price is way down now (got it for $8 i think), so you can't beat that.  For the price and it being the most entertaining of all the movies is why I give it five stars.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Can't go wrong with lego.  The box doesn't com full of legos to the top, but enough for many hours of play time for my 5 year old girl.
B007R21JJK|5.0|This motherboard has some nice features, including a built in troubleshooting readout LCD and an internal power button if you need to do extensive testing without having to mess with front panels. Another feature I like on this model is the dual BIOS which means if I ever get one of them into a non working state, I can just flip a switch on the motherboard and boot into some fail-safe settings.<br /><br />The board I received works a-okay so far and I would recommend it to anyone who is building their own machine, if only for the ease of troubleshooting which means easier times with the multitude of components that someone could install.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The beginning with the financial background was a little boring, but didn't take long and the story was up and running at full speed.  Couldn't put it down!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|For gaming, or anything else, this processor is great and has solid performance/stability.<br /><br />It doesn't have hyperthreading, but for most things I do, I haven't missed this functionality.  So, unless you're doing a lot of video encoding or other CPU intensive tasks this is a great processor even at stock speeds with the stock cooler.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone looking for a great balance of price vs performance.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I really enjoyed this game but I should have read the reviews first.  I never spent money on coins or peanuts but the games has stopped working completely.  I was on level 20-something when I tried to play it and it stopped opening.  After several days of not working I reinstalled it and got to level 30-something and it stopped opening again.  Very disappointed.
B005F96UNM|5.0|Movie arrived on time, in brand new condition.  Boyfriend loves the movie, and I was happy to find it for such a great price!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I have read!!! I couldn't put it down....  it made laugh, cry, and kinda of squirm....
0062009540|5.0|My daughter is a big time PLL fan. She received this book for Christmas and has not put it down since. States she likes the book even more than the series.  She is 13 years old.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it........this book left me breathless and waiting breathlessly for the next book in the series.......keep up the good work Sylvia!!
1938469011|5.0|Well written and informative. Heironymus does a great job of balancing the science and technical aspects with his obvious enthusiasm for hops, which makes the book a fun and interesting read!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After beginning Hopeless, my first complaint is that I thought Holder would be that bad body with a sometimes-sweet-side that is emotionally unstable, destructive, and controlling... the one that most girls think is romantic, but I would probably end up punching him in the face if I were dating him.<br /><br />My second complaint is that Hopeless is so damn cheesy sometimes, with a touch of what seemed to be insta-love.<br /><br />My third complaint is that the characters, although well developed and completely addictive, seem much much MUCH older than the 17 and 18 they are. It would be way more believable if they were 22 and 23. I'd even buy it at 20 and 21.<br /><br />My FINAL complaint is... damn Colleen Hover for making me love her writing so much, that I don't really give a s*** about the first three complaints. Seriously. The women may write some super sappy love stories, but I will be damned if she doesn't stock them with some of the heaviest s*** ever. Her books always leave me exhausted because I go through a roller-coaster of emotions. I laugh, I cry, I smile, I cry, I grimace, I cry... well you get the idea.<br /><br />For real though, Hopeless was intense. It's not without it's issues, but Hoover has a way with words that makes you overlook the petty stuff and focus on the life changing advice pouring out of her novels. Her characters struggles and revelations will make you sit back and go \\"wow\\". If you don't have a reaction to this book, you may want to check your pulse, because there is a good possibility you're heartless.<br /><br />Those are my thoughts at least, but what do I know? I'm just a hopeless romantic with a obsession that forces me to spend the money I use for groceries or bills on books(Who needs to eat or have heat when there is a book in your hands? lol).
0765325950|3.0|This book can't stand on its own as good reading; you should probably be fairly heavily invested in the Wheel of Time series before you read this.  AMOL is a series of wonderful plot point injections and very pleasurable wrapping up, and there were a lot of sections that I really enjoyed.  But it almost reads like a bullet point list of notes that have been fleshed out into a series of very short stories.  There may be way too many PoV changes.<br /><br />The flow of the book is weird; a few things seemingly happen for no reason, and for a book that's essentially about one huge climax, we spend a curious about of time focusing on events that wind up not mattering too much... because they were threads we had to wrap up, rather than being good story.<br /><br />In the end I think this is the inevitable conclusion of an epic that had become severely weighted down by things that *had to happen*.  This is a problem with prophecy (and having such a huge cast).  We spend a lot of time reading about things that had to happen, but aren't as interesting as the main plot threads *at all*.  Brandon Sanderson tries at various stages to mask how boring some of these plot threads are by using some interesting PoVs and characters, and he's often pretty successful because he's a good writer.  Parts of this book were double punishment inflicted upon us as a result of the scope of the previous books.<br /><br />Compared to other final works, this book is pretty disappointing.  I really found myself wanting to just find out what the plot points were rather than becoming immersed in the writing because the flow of the book was so strange.<br /><br />My rating doesn't reflect the lack of ebook; I think that's a horrible decision and I hope that the publisher gets wise on this, but I'm not going to penalize the book for the publisher's decisions.  But hey, my friend ordered me this book via Amazon and I had finished it by the time the copy I ordered from B&N made it to my door a week later, so at least one company is doing good things for its customers.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Not Compatible with Kindle once you access your yahoo email you are un able to sign out your Yahoo Email .  I have had many computer expert to make sure I was not incorrect.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Not only does this movie have a great story, but it has some good music and songs..We can watch it over and over..
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Wasted my time reading this book. Just had to skip over pages it was so boring just trying to get to the end.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|amazeing game great controls and you have control of volume overall I would buy any final fantasy game they release on the Amazon market
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It takes a while to figure out where this book is going, but once you do, it shows the knowledge of the author.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book. My concerns about whether or not it would hold my interest were quickly abated. I laughed quite a bit and l found myself literally holding my breath at the end. I look forward to reading it again!
B0091REZMW|3.0|You can only play for a short time before either leaving or being prompted to pay.  I prefer. to leave.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I'm constantly ignoring the battery warnings on my mouse so this is such a genius invention.<br />I'm gonna save so much in batteries that this will pay itself off in no time.<br />Plus the design is sleek and looks like its been made my Apple themselves.<br /><br />The charge lasts a long side so if you don't remember to put your mouse to bed for a while- no problem!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I play this on my kindle fire.  The graphics are downright aww-worthy with a side of weird, and the puzzles are fun without being too time consuming.  I only gave it four stars because the touch screen response for the game is sluggish, requiring multiple tries to slide the puddings and push buttons, etc.
B00288KNLS|5.0|One must appreciate the superb animations resulting from stop action frame by frame manipulation of characters and props.  The use of fiber optics was very creative.
B005LAII1C|3.0|Very comical movie.  I will watch this again due to the fact I purchased it, but should have rented before buying.  Some of the humor just goes to far for a Teddy Bear.  But overall good story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Total surprise ending - lots of surprises throughout this last book!  Couldn't put it down!  Read it straight through in once day!
B002GJI8PM|5.0|I love all of the Lord of the Rings music, and couldn't would wait to get all of the soundtracks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Brilliant story line!!  Full of twist and turns, great, great read!! I couldn't put it down!  Can't wait to read the Mocking Jay!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This story caught my curiosity with the first sentence, then held on to it with the next 4 paragraphs. A really good read - as usual -for Mr. Kings' work. He never ceases to amaze me with his story basis of &#34; .. maybe it COULD happen ..&#34;. Not the usual reactions of &#34;.. oh heck no - NO WAY that could happen ..&#34;. S.K. makes me FEEL the emotions of all the characters in this story & that makes for &#34;GOOD READS&#34;. An interesting story line, a comfy seat and an ice cold rootbeer set the tone for my &#34;book-a-week&#34; and has found a permanent spot on my bookshelf. Thank You S. King.
B009CSFUFQ|5.0|i love this book in the collectors edition. i have read it a dozen times but this version is fantastic!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|it works perfectly! I love it! its one of my favorite movies so im glad i bought it and it works like a charm!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This movie was pretty much what I hoped for with lots of great singing and some wonderful portrayals. All of the usual cast of &#34;college type&#34; characters were including although this movie primarily delves into the world of a'cappella singing groups. Lots of fun to watch!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I watched this with my mother and my 10 year old daughter, she loved the singing parts but I must say some of the adult humor was a bit much for her.  It even had my mother a little uncomfortable with her watching it.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Too hard to control. Using my finger on the game board makes it impossible to see where Pac man is going.  Using the control at the bottom us hard too, doesn't really correlate with the game board.
B003B02O3C|2.0|Why do we continue to purchase Grisham's books? My friends and I ask ourselves this question each time one comes out, we pay full price, and then read it--expecting something different than all of his other books. Okay, JG, we get it!!! Please change your formula. I appreciate that you give a lot of money to your Virginia community and am thrilled by what you've done for St. Anne's. I'm glad that you're spending my hard-earned money of doing good for mankind. I loved your earlier books, even your first one, for which you actually apologized!!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Loved everything about this movie! The cast was superb..while its not going to win any oscars anytime soon it's a fun watch lots of laughs. If your a fan of 80's music & just pop music in general you'll like it. My hubby who is into mainly manly action flicks even liked it & laughed through out the film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love that the season started off with a story about Agnes.  Being the middle child, I really relate to her.  Shirley Maclean really adds to the whole drama, and I love her and Maggie Smith together.  They are two of the spryest old bats I've ever known and they really make this classic fly!  The costumes and the dialog really make this time piece spring to life.  I would recommend this program to anyone who loves Classics.  PBS You've done it again!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Love this movie! This movie was when I fell in love with Emma Stone. She is hilarious! This movie is now up there on my list with Mean Girls.
0521397812|4.0|ANOTHER ESL CONVERSATION STARTER THAT IS QUITE USEFUL IN THE CLASSROOM.. ACTIVITIES ARE EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY STUDENTS.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|I love Ugly Betty. This season completes my Ugly Betty collection. So sad it had to end, but such a great series!
B008NR8YTQ|3.0|O.K. , Love Gary Moore but this was mediocre and not those ball-Busting Solos I was used to hearing !!!
B001ER4CNY|4.0|I bought this for my mom, who loves I Dream of Jeannie. The Genie bottle is just made of cardboard and wasn't all that impressive, which was disappointing. But it looks great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Where to start off!! after all the book i have read i never once was surprised by the outcome of it.. i knew something was up the first time shy meet holder that i thought wasn't as close to what the outcome was. holder is a dream, the way that he loves her you feel like.. i fall in love with him its hard not to.. because he has been looking for her all his life. this is a must read book it would have you crying and loving every page
B000JO9JHW|5.0|At first, we werent sure if we wanted to continue this and even paused after the first two shows of the season, then later came back to it...loved it, now Im hooked...would recommend this to anyone especially those who love crime movies.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Steig Larson has penned a masterful suspense series that is extremely difficult to put down, in fact, I just ordered the other two books in the series.  I first saw the story in the american-language film with Daniel Craig, then a friend made me aware that all three books were made into Swedish films, so I ordered them from Amazon, and they were good too.  I decided to get the first book because, at heart, I am a reader and the books always contain more meat than is feasible to include in a film.  The book did not disappoint and I look forward to the other two.  Larson's style is intricate, but easily comprehended, and his description of computer hacking shows a lot of research.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Yes, this is a typical Stephen King book. It starts out with some realistic stuff, and even continues to portray that throughout the many pages. But in the typical King fashion, it takes a turn towards the weird, which is why I like to read his books. He puts a sci fi twist to his novels that isn't a typical sci fi novel.<br /><br />If you like King, you'll like this one for sure.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I must have received a poorly constructed case because, it appeared to be of cheap construction and did not seem to seal properly, even though it was, indeed waterproof. The plastic bent and warped very easily and when the case was on the phone, it sounded like I was talking/listening through a tin can during phone calls. I was very disappointed. I am finally ordering an Otterbox, which I should have done in the first place, as this was what I had on my iPhone 3.

1401937519|3.0|This was an interesting read but there is some troubling stuff hear.  I was particularly troubled by a lack of responsibility for everyone in this life; whether good or bad, innocent or mass murderer, everyone is treated the same in the afterlife. That does not fly with the bible.  The bible makes it very clear as to how we should conduct our lives in this life and that we will surely be judged in the next life for how we lived this life.  Remember the passage about separating the weeds from the crop?  Anita talks about dying and has that in quotes but to my recollection she never really died, at least according to medicine or science.  She went into a coma and her organs were shutting down but she still had brain waves and a heartbeat. So, unlike other NDE stories I have read she was alive the whole time. I am not trying to invalidate her experience or her story but only to say that it is not 100% in agreement with Christianity.  So for me, because it is in contradiction with Christian teachings in part, I cannot accept it as a whole.

B0049J3QF4|3.0|My son loves it. It has some tender moments, and is vastly better than the horrible Cars 2. However, too often cartoons that are out for a few years get hailed as &#34;classics&#34; when they are far from even very good. Pixar has made one great movie: Wall-E. They made several that are competent. But most of their kids' stories lack heart. Plenty of children's movies over the years have been made with soul - this one has sentimentality. Oh, and cool cars!
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|I loved the look and feel of this product and my son loves it too.  However, the flash time is too long, especially for a four year that doesn't sit still for long.  The picture quality was also not that great on the screen.  I did not download them to my computer so maybe it's just the screen that is poor quality and not the actual picture quality.  It just takes too long to actually take the picture so I'm returning it.
0321898648|1.0|I am not the first to report this problem but it seems that it has remained uncorrected for a long time--note the dates on similar ratings.<br />The book requires that lessons be followed from the enclosed DVD.  However, the relevant DVD lessons are missing.  I am using the most recent OSX10.8.2 and the most recent edition of the book.  The book looks excellent but its usefulness is greatly diminished by a reader's inability to follow along.<br /><br />As sold it is a defective product though some seem to get it to work-perhaps on older operating systems.  I am contacting PeachPiit as some have suggested but this really should not be necessary for a product sold on Amazon Prime.

B004H6P2O2|5.0|I'm still working my way through this, and I'll revise my evaluation if I have to . . . but on first blush this is a terrific bargain: 5 discs at under $5.00 a disc, in great sound, and in my judgment, very good performances.  By now you probably know the rap on Lorin Maazel: too fussy, too controlling and unspontaneous, getting worse in these aspects as he gets older, yadda, yadda, yadda.  Well, I haven't done a point-by-point comparison of Maazel with his earlier self, but just on their own terms, these newer performances are just fine.  His new Fourth, for example, is in much richer, more immediate, more beautiful sound than his estimable 1960's version, and it takes nothing away from the grit and the unrelenting grimness of this great symphony.  This is as good as any recording I've heard -- Karajan's great 1960's one on DG, for example -- the concentration of the playing, and the richness of the lower brass and strings are riveting.  In the Second Symphony, there are interesting contrasts with Berglund's great (to my mind) Helsinki recording.  Berglund is more forward-moving in the first two movements especially (though he seems to omit the first-movement repeat), where Maazel lays out the thematic material more deliberately or even clinically, though that word doesn't do justice to the richness of the sound.  Then in the developments and climaxes of these first two movements, Maazel puts it all together to build to a strong ending.  In the third and fourth movements -- which make up a single big span of music, Maazel is simply superb -- arguably the best I've heard: seamless transitioning, particularly so between the third and fourth movements (a great moment this) but also within the movements, great solo playing, terrific massed brass playing, tender string-playing, and a build-up to the climax that is just overwhelming.  All in all a great interpretation of the symphony.  The box also includes a fine account of the Violin Concerto, a vivid and playful Third symphony that also drives to a fine (and very different) climax, and the bits of the other symphonies I've played sound fine too.  Sibelius fans -- and those wanting to explore at a cheap price -- shouldn't hesitate to snap this up.symphony that also drives to a fine (and very different) climax, and the bits of the other symphonies I've played sound fine too.

B0001CNRS4|5.0|I never would have picked this movie, based on the genre, music and theme. A friend likes this movie and said we should watch it. I was prepared to sit through another piece of hip hop hell. (SPOILER?) Music, Hip hop, but happy feel good music. Genre, dance, no jump & hump, stomp, ballet country or hooker moves. But feel good club dance. I wish I could move like that. Theme, dancer gets her dreams? To much to say without spoiling it. I am surprise, to have liked it enough, to give it 5 stars. If you know someone who thinks like I did this may just change their minds. I could drone on.
0316017930|5.0|In his book, Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell examines highly successful individuals and sets out to prove that their success is not a limited product of their intelligence, talent or ambitious, but very much due to their cultural background and opportunities obtained during their youth. Additionally, that people and their opportunities are very much a result of where and when (place and time) they are raised.<br /><br />I always cringe when people say that their success is entirely self-made and that \\"nobody ever gave them anything\\". Simply, because that is not true and they come across as bitter and angry. Gladwell does a solid job at proving that success or failure is a mix of things and one of the key factors is other people, including parents and teachers. How you perceive your life and opportunities are often a direct result of how you were raised. Success is often a multistep process and the foundation is built in childhood.<br /><br />Gladwell doesn't make the case that only children of rich parents are successful, although it doesn't hurt. Success, in part, can come with being from a cultural background that values a hard work ethic. The ultimate key to being a highly successful individual, seems to be more than one factor falling into place at the same time.<br /><br />For example, he argues that someone like Bill Gates was successful not only due to his intelligence or parent's wealth, but that he was born in the right year and had unusual access to computers. He knew when opportunities came his way and took them.  All of these factors made him successful and they are not mutually exclusive.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was \\"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\\", where Gladwell makes an argument for why certain cultural norms, specifically cultures that have a high power distance,  lead to a higher incident of plane crashes. It was completely compelling and a bit scary! Luckily, Gladwell noted that the recognition of this has led to airlines making changes, resulting in safer flights.<br /><br />I found Gladwell's book to be completely engaging, fascinating and entertaining. He has a knack for creating a compelling argument and taking the reader down unexpected paths. It's a quick read and would be great for a classroom or a book club, as it naturally lends itself to discussion and might be very polarizing.<br /><br />Please check out my blog for more book reviews and musings.
B005H2IAM6|4.0|Three words - WAVE MOTION GUN!!!  When we first watched the live-action version of Yamato, there was geek cheer at that sucker being fired off!<br /><br />The story line and cinematography was good, but had some variations from the original story (and I don't mean the Americanized &#34;Star Blazers&#34; either) that didn't fully jive up with the original storyline.<br /><br />Overall, the production was awesome, and I'm very happy to have it my collection.  Highly recommended!!

B0006AAS5G|2.0|I've on this for two months now.<br /><br />PRO: Cheaply priced watch; looks expensive granted it's not all scratched up.<br />CON: Lots of useless features; clunky feeling crown; and uncomfortable to wear.<br /><br />Functionality: The time piece works as it should be; Accurate to the second.<br />  The chronograph/minute timer also works but not as useful; there's a  60 sec dial and also a 60 minute dial to measure time elapsed; so if you want to see your best lap, be prepared to count fine lines just to measure the minute and seconds elapsed. Useless.<br />  The dials have glow in the dark material; but it's too thin of a strip to be visible under low lighting. Works only if it's pitch black dark.  Again useless feat.<br />  The watch band is uncomfortable; it chafes my wrists (esp the pinky finger side of the wrist.)<br />Aesthetics:  Silver dial is nicely polished; precise and tight second hand. Detailed background;  good sized window for a scrawny wrist like mine.<br />  The watch band is easily scratched so I'm sure it's not a stainless steel it's probably some allloy plated with some steel.<br />  The 3 crowns for adjusting time or activating the chronograph feels loose/wiggly once it's unscrewed.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Just an everyday watch; not really a rewarding watch to own because it feels cheap.

I would highly recommend this book. One point to make, the first half of the book can seem a little dull and predictable, but it is well worth sticking with it for the second half
0061998494|4.0|This book is a funny and candid biography of a Scottish comedian's life and love of America.  I enjoy Craig Ferguson's late night show and this book shows the history behind the successful talk show host.  The reader has an understanding of his life and basis for his witty humor.  Craig Ferguson connects with his audience on the show and in the book.  His pride in being an American and the opportunities here are heartfelt.  They serve as a reminder that hard work and perseverance pay off and that you can truly change your life.  I truly enjoyed the honesty and range of emotion Craig shows as a writer.  I would recommend this very highly.

B00181JGI2|5.0|For some reason, the Coen brother's \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is often labelled a cult hit. Let's see, hmm. I know two dozen people who have seen this great film. Each of those people know two dozen other people who love it. And so on... and so on... As of this writing, over 900 people have written reviews of it. To me, it is too wildly popular to earn the status \\"cult\\" which would indicate a lack of popularity among the general film-going audience. Perhaps it has a cult status because people recite lines by heart, or worship certain characters, a la \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\" Perhaps. And, ultimately, it doesn't matter. This is a gut-hurting, laugh out loud movie that has a wide audience that just gets wider with each passing year.<br /><br />I won't go over the plot (since you have about 900 other reviews covering that), suffice to say that there are as many twists and turns and twisted characters populating this world to keep you more than entertained. As strange as some of the film is, nothing seems beyond the scope of reality. In fact, the Coen brothers have a great talent for making the strange seem real and reality seem bizarre. \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is classic Coen brothers, in this regard. Added to that, you have a monster cast who not only perform superbly, they seem to be enjoying themselves. Bridges, Goodman, Buscemi and Moore push the comic envelope without going over-the-top. (John Turturro's relatively small part is a hilarious gem.)<br /><br />It's hard to believe that 15 years have gone by since I first saw this great film. And unlike other comedies of the late '90s, this one holds up. Laugh for laugh, nothing has gotten stale with age. Now kids who were just born when this film came out are howling with laughter at it. As The Stranger (played by Sam Elliott) intones,  \\"I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself.\\" This could apply to the growing, not-cult fan base for \\"The Big Lebowski\\".

B006UG90RM|5.0|I love Van Halen and I love their music. The first single \\"Tattoo\\" was very different from what I was expecting. It has a very slow and reserved pace that I thought was odd. I expected something more along the lines of fast paced barn-burner. However, I understand that singles are often a marketing ploy and I got to believe the song was made to appeal to the most general of audiences in order to boost sales. I don't expect much out of singles in the first place. Even them, the song seems to grow on you. It might not be your favorite song on the album, but you won't pass it up when it comes on you mp3 or ipod.<br /><br />The rest of the album is fairly top-notch work. I heard a lot about how Van Halen rehashed some of their older songs in lieu of making an album of all new material. I really welcomed that throwback to a time when riffs and leads were less \\"glammy\\" and orchestrated then they are now. When I say that, I mean to reference how some songs feel more choreographed and pretty. I feel like this album has more of a natural and down to earth tone, vibe, and grit that I personally enjoy. In particular, most of the riffs don't follow basic power chord schemes; the instruments complement one another rhythmically on the album instead of echoing and following one another throughout a song.<br /><br />I got exactly what I was looking for in this album. It was fun listening to that grit and stripped down style that always complements rock guitar so well. As for my favorite track, my personal favorite is \\"You and Your Blues\\". It's a catchy riff with some bluesy vocals and some burning choruses and breakdowns. I would definitely recommend this album for a first time listener or a long time listener. Whether you buy it here on amazon or see at a retail store, I say pick it up.<br /><br />*A special note of the DVD included.<br />There is not a whole lot of content on the DVD other than a couple of acoustic renditions of popular songs from early years. I thought it was a pretty cool novelty item if you have never seen the band live. It doesn't do them justice like some of their live dvds. I wouldn't say it is imperative to have , but, if you find it on the cheap, it is not a bad addition to the set.pretty cool novelty item if you have never seen the band live.

B009CPEOC4|4.0|I like Katy Perry's music, it is catchy and fun. However, I was pretty surprised to see someone who is so new on the music scene making a feature film about their career. But we were looking for something to watch the other night and this was one of the options, and my daughter picked it. I ended up really liking the movie! Katy Perry comes across as very down to earth and quirky, which is certainly someone I would rather my Daughter look up to than a Brittney Spears! She is talented, hardworking and really makes an effort for her fans and family which was nice to see. I recommend it!

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Now, first let me say, my 5 star rating doesn't mean it's on par with a classic \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" that I would rate 5 stars. I'm simply saying in a sea of all the other GARBAGE re-hashes and sequels, Looper was thought provoking, and very entertaining. In that sense, it definitely earns 5 stars.<br /><br />I find myself checking the info pane on my dvd player to see how much time is left on a lot of movies these days. I didn't have to do that with this movie. That's a sign of a good movie for me. Also a good sign is when is analyzing all the plot lines 30 minutes after the movie is done. That happened with this movie in the same fashion of Inception, or when The Matrix first came out. I know a lot of people include plot summaries in their reviews, but I'm not going to do that. What I will say is Gordon-Levitt is  becoming a pretty good leading man. Bruce Willis plays the same character Bruce Willis has played since the 80's, and that's fine, that's what he does, and it's great. Also, good supporting roles by Jeff Daniels and Emily Blunt.<br /><br />The real star of this movie is the story, how this didn't get nominated for \\"Best Original Screenplay\\" is beyond me. With all the mediocrity out there, give this a try.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I love this movie and feel they did a great job putting a new spin on an old and fun story.  So much better than trying to redo what's already been done, and will give them so much more flexibility to go so many new directions with this new storyline.  My only hope is that they don't wait so long to make more - one a year would be fabulous.  Love love love Chris Pine as Kirk - great casting all across the board.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Well, Renner isn't Damon, let's get that out of the way. And this is the worst Bourne film, and a obvious money grab. But, it's a entertaining money grab. This film is definitely more of a traditional movie. Differing from the non stop frantic pace of the previous Bourne films.<br /><br />It's funny, when I started this review I had a 4-star rating in mind. The more I think about it, the less I'm impressed. It probably didn't help that I watched Looper the next day which absolutely stomps The Bourne Legacy in every category. The shelf life on this film is just not there. I can turn on any of the Bourne films when they come on cable these days and fall right into the plot. That just won't happen with this one.<br /><br />Long story short, if you can try not to judge this film against the previous ones, have a couple of hours, and want to be mildly entertained, give it a shot. Just don't expect to feel like you gained something new from the Bourne franchise.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Ok, probably one of the best casting decisions in a long time.  Wathcing him go from strong and cocky to strong and noble was really nice and a great touch.  Nice reflection of my childhood images of these other worlds and the gods that inhabit them.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I don't get it, I really wanted to like this movie. I like comic book films, I really enjoyed much of what X-men put out, and I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman. First of all, this movie pretty much requires you to watch at least some of the previous movies with each individual character. I watched and was mildly entertained by Iron Man, liked Norton in The Hulk, and had the absolute displeasure of sitting through the garbage that was Captain America. Now, I never got around to Thor, so maybe that detracted from me liking this movie since from what I understand, the main villan was introduced in the Thor movie.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining in that it brings all the characters together. Where the lose me is the same way that Transformers and a lot of these other films are. The last half or quarter of the movie is some long drawn out CGI fight-fest. It's straight out of a video game sequence. Some may like that, I just don't, it loses my attention in the chaos.<br /><br />It's too bad because there are some good performances here. Downey Jr steals the show with his wit and sarcasm,Chris Hemsworth and Ruffalo also play there characters well. Evans continues his stiff depiction of Captain America, Samuel L Jackson does his Samuel L. Jackson thing, and I'm still trying to figure out what the heck Scarlett Johansson was doing there. Oh, and Jeremey Renner is in every movie now.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's a bad movie, and from the box office numbers people love it. But the substance just wasn't there. Maybe they expect you too spend 10+ hours meeting the characters in the previous films and then turn on this bad boy to see some action. I just can't get on board with that.
0545265355|5.0|While this is obviously not Hemmingway, the author does a great job catching and keeping our attention.  Nice flow from plot twist to each next step.  Love the ending, obsiously leaving a door open for more but not in an annoying way.  I think you really have to read all three together, and did so in 9 days.  Gripping!
B001F12J48|1.0|The 3D is bad and would not promote buying it.  There was an outline of red around the characters.<br />The Polar Express.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'd recommend this book for teenagers on up.  The story seems far-fetched but becomes more believable the more you read.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She wanted it bad.  We both watched it and loved the plot.  Only problem is it started to skip toward the end but could have been my player.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Maybe the movie made sense of this collection of stories but I could not figure out where it was going while reading it.
0792164903|4.0|My wife loves this movie and never sees it on network television.  It was a gift for her for Christmas.  She can watch it anytime she wants now.
B000QUM3EU|3.0|It wasn't as exciting as I remembered it.  I guess it all comes down to our tastes changing as we age.  Still, its a pretty good show.  I will watch it again.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Once you start watching this series, you're hooked! Great writing and great casting. I now understand why the show has won so many awards. Awesome!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|These game was fun and it was just like Mario. I think the Mario sauries was fun to play and this is a little harder to play when it comes to rich screen but it is still a really fun game to play I recommend it to the people who like the Mario type of game play.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Really takes you back to the old days. Way before my time but its still a good reminder.<br />I couldn't stop laughing for the fact bane from batman kept popping in my head.
1419701533|5.0|my nephew is 10 years old and he read the first book and was hooked so i dedcidec to get him the whole selection of the books.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|When I first watched it in Korea (3D IMAX), I didn't liked it.<br />I think it is because so many super heroes are fighting with only one evil just didn't appealed for me.<br />Then I watched it again in the US in 3D. I didn't liked it again.<br />Kida boring.<br />Most of the super hero movie, I like. But this one, no.<br />But i bought it because it is one of the biggest hit film historically.<br />I guess I owned it just because of that reason.<br /><br />The picture quality is super sharp.<br />And the sound is 7.1 HD channel.<br />All in all owning it in Bluday if you like this movie.
B00846REIS|1.0|I read the book because some said this book was better than fifty shades of grey..  There is no comparison bared to you was quite boring.
B008RC72G8|2.0|I watched this film at a theater.<br />I didn'te liked it.<br />I thought that it's because of my condition that day.<br />I bought it in a bluray because it was 9.99$ at that time.<br />I felt regret.<br />I still hate it.<br />Story is boring and actors are lame.<br />Worst Tim's movie ever.<br />Maybe he was tired making movie at that time or he was drunk.<br />The sound and picture quality is very good. The sound was divided into 5 channel HD nicely.<br />The video is clear and sharp.<br />If you watched this movie at the theater and still wanna have it, you should buy the bluray.<br />I don't know why they put the price higher from 9.99$ to 19.96$ though.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|love love love this.movie I think this is the best one so far. all the dance moves and actors are current.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|I first recognized Channing through this movie.<br />He is kinda rebellion that matches perfect with his costume and his face.<br />Of course the dancing sequance it the highlight and the chamistry with the woman part was nice.<br />IF you want to see Channing's real deal, watch this movie.<br />Good Video/audio quality DVD. 5.1 channel. No need to buy bluray cause it's not a masterpiece.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book but it blew me away. Thank-you for writing such an amazing book.
B003EYVXT6|4.0|Vincenzo Natali is a good director. He knows how to use the budget wisely.<br />His other movie 'Cube' becomes an istant classic.<br />Now this one, with a lot of budget, he made a pretty good monster sexual, incest movie.<br />Good Video, audio quality.<br />Liked it. Good price too.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a good Harry Bosch story but parts of it made me have to suspend reality too much.  I could recommend it, but the older books are better.
B004XQO90E|3.0|First of all, the picture quality and the sound was very good.<br />If you watched this movie in a theater and wanna buy still, buy the bluray. It's well transferred.<br />But the story, I didn't liked it.<br />I didn't liked it when I watched at the theater, I didn't liked it when I bought and watched again.<br />I like his other movie MOON very much and a great fand of the director.<br />But this one, na~~
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|The game never worked, it just froze on my kindle after about 2 minutes.  Not worth it even if its free.
6304458304|5.0|I watched this movie long time ago at the theater and liked it very much.<br />Then I own it in a VHS tape.<br />Now when I tried to search every site to own it in DVD, the price was too high thinking about how old this movie is.<br />It was 19$ and something when I bought it and it's even higher now.<br />Give us a break. Lower the price.<br />Most of the movies like this is between 7-11$ now.<br />BUT, I still don't feel regret spending 19 dollars and some to own it.
B004F57CFW|5.0|What can I say negative about this. One of my favorite CD's and It completes my collection that was lost in a fire years ago.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I like Woody very much. And personally think this movie is the funnest movie he ever made.<br />The picture and sound quality are all very goood. HD sound and video all right.<br />When I purchased this bluray, it was something like 16$ and something.<br />Now it's under 10$.<br />Quickly buy it before the price goes highter.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I heard the Thrift Shop on the radio on the long drive and liked it so much I wrote down the title to look it up later.  I found the music video on youtube and have played it upwards of 20 times.  I decided to branch out after that and see what else they offered.<br /><br />I was expecting more of the same: somewhere between LMFAO and Eminem, funny but still solid hip hop.  And then I found Wings.  It's well crafted; it's powerful; it builds on the theme that materialism brings out the worst in humanity and gives the Thrift Shop context and a much deeper significance than I would have expected from from a dude in a fox fur coat with a vanilla ice haircut rapping about his cock.<br /><br />I just ordered the album and I'm really looking forward to exploring it.  I see big things in these guys' future.  And not just their choice of coats.
B000I0QLZU|2.0|I had the VHS version of this movie.<br />I liked this movie because Angelina was in her peak years at that time.<br />But buying this bluday was a mistake somehow.<br />The quality is really really bad. Even worse than DVD.<br />What can I say.<br />IT's cheap and I can live with it.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game.  but I hate that when you want to change your player you cant because its so expensive
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Like Step up, this movie is good because of Channing. His dancing part is amazing.<br />He is a good actor but also a good dancer I guess.<br />For DVD, everything is decent.<br />Video and audio.<br />It's not a sci-fi or action film, so DVD is enough to own.
B001TW68P4|5.0|BEING A CHILD OF THE '60'S, BOUGHT THE TURTLES, BYRDS,  ETC.  WELL WORTH THE COST TO ENJOY THE TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.  THESE GUYS ROCKED THE '60'S AND THEIR MUSIC REMAINS WORTHY!!!
B005LAII12|4.0|i watched this movie in Korea.<br />It has so many fun moments.<br />But the thing is the Korean audiences didn't know what to do when the funny parts came out.<br />They just didn't know how to respond!<br />Am I supposed to laugh at that part or is this kinda dirty joke? They were confused!<br />For instence, when the Teddy is playing with the lotion at the supermarket to look like he is jurking off, people in the theater were all very very quiet. Is this a joke or dirty sexual stuff?<br />I know what to do but tried not to laugh out loud.<br />I bought it in DVD just to study more.<br />Did I liked it? It was ok. It reminds me of A.I(Spielberg's) movie that Teddy also appears.<br />I am a filmmaker and need to learn more about my people-Korean (Asian)<br />The picuture and sound are all good.<br />Think no need to buy it in a bluray because it's not a masterpiece or anything.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|looks great, but as with other backpacks I'm a little concerned the threads will begin to unravel soon, though no sign of that.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Comparing to one of those european Slasher film, maybe this is nothing.<br />But still it has a lot of shocking moments. Slasher bluddy parts.<br />Both actors acted so well.<br />The story is so well made that I cannot even judge or agree 100% to any part-Both parts are innocent and both are not innocent.<br />This is why it's a Very good movie.<br />I even felt sad when Gerald dies.<br />When I first watched, I thought it is a so so movie.<br />Now, I can say it's a very good film!<br />Go buy it.<br />The film quality is very good. No grains.<br />The sound is also perfect.<br />Bluray is indeed a very good quality.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|I had see  this movie and forgot what an inspiring g movie it was. When you think you know what each character will do, they step outside the stereotype. Each character endears you to them! Ashanti shines in this movie. You'll cheer for the team! I recommend you watch it again!
B007OV9EYG|3.0|It is a colorful movie. Fun to watch that.<br />But the story is too much instructive. Don't cut the trees.<br />I am not waching movies to learn things. I am watching movies to enjoy.<br />This one is too much pushy for us to learn something.<br />Didn't liked it.<br />I don't know why I even purchased the 3D included expensive one.<br />just because the movie has a huge hit at the boxoffice doesn't mean it's a fun one always.<br />The picture and the sound seems very good.<br />If you still wanna buy this, buying Bluray is a good choice.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|paid for it and went to download. it took all day to download. went to play it and said I needed to still install it. I have been trying to download still and it won't.  it's a waste of money in my opinion.
B000LW7OWE|5.0|I like Doors very much and enjoyed this movie for so many time even if I owned in Video disc only.<br />Then finally I have a chance to buy it in Bluray.<br />The price is so low that made me surprised and then the sound quality.<br />The sound is 7.1 Channel HD!<br />The image seems decent.<br />I am happy with this purchase.
B009B8YZKS|2.0|I wish I had just rented this, I wasn't very impressed with it at all. The production hours were decent, but the story dragged on for about 10 minutes of action.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I feel that these books are written more for teenagers than for adults.  I haven't finished the book but am well into it.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|3 in 1 is an awesome bluray to have in your collection at every home. you got to have it
B00138KNFK|5.0|In a word - \\"Awesome\\"!<br /><br />Another great effort from a great band of musicians.  Almost every song on this collection is worth listening to.  Also a nice mix of musical styles.<br /><br />While \\"Pamela\\" was really the big hit off this album, the follow-up \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" is equally as enjoyable.  The overlooked powerful and fast moving \\"Straight For The Heart\\" should have also been released as a hit single.  Even slower songs like \\"These Chains\\" is so smooth that it is hard not to get lost in.  And I can't even describe \\"Mushanga\\" with it's sort of spanish influence - it must be heard to be appreciated.<br /><br />Another musical home run!  Do not pass this one up!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case is especially protective--soft, just &#34;gummy&#34; enough to provide a firm hold, and it comes up over the sides to protect the face.  The only downside is that it prevents a good connection to the earphone plug.
B000008LNS|4.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this signified a change for TOTO.  Much harder than previous efforts.<br /><br />While I personally did not care for some of the songs in this collection, I have to admit that this shows the adaptability of the band and paved the way for the future.  My favorites - \\"Don't Chain My Heart\\", \\"How Many Times\\", and even the title track (which is very loud and powerful).  As usual, there are some slower songs like \\"Wings Of Time\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" that are definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />Overall, this shows that TOTO is not just a rock/pop group but can also contend with the big boys.  Unfortunately this also marks the departure of drummer extrordinare Jeff Porcaro who was taken way too soon (RIP).<br /><br />Shame on the U.S. airwaves for failing to recognize a continued talented band and kicking them to the curb!
0875428940|5.0|Although I no longer use this deck for my readings I still very much appreciate the pagan symbology and artwork of the cards.  I am pleased to have them in my collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am on the 3rd book and am really enjoying this series. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good book without all the foul language. The story line has some gory ideals, but it really draws you in to what a post-world could be like.
1577314808|4.0|...but soon into the book I knew what he was saying and couldn't even make myself go forward.  It was like reading old news of what I had already gone through and established on my own.  Fabulously wise and helpful information the author sets forth - so it is not my intent that my review is to diminish the author, book, or its content in any way.  That was simply my experience.
B003QSMC18|5.0|My two daughter and I all enjoyed this movie. It gives a touch of New Orleans' culture, a good message, and a little romance.
B0067R0APK|5.0|very accurate for my area. love the videos. could use a bit more interaction though. a must have for all your weather needs
8866130915|5.0|This was as described; perfect size for a handbag, while providing sufficient room for appointments and notes.  I especially like that it is simple without unnecessary frills.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was a wonderful book. The sex was great but the love was even better. At first, the sex seemed redundant but the more I read, the more interesting it got. I loved the fact that an innocent young woman can teach this rich man about something that he knows nothing about. Something that no amount of money can ever provide. It wasn't all about sex, there was a real story underneath all that sex. I enjoyed the read!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What a great story, told from an interesting perspective. Totally recommend! I was hooked from the prologue, and it kept amazing tension through the whole book. I'll have to re-read as I was in such a state to finish the book I'm sure I missed a ton of details.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|the movies /DVD and Blu Ray) was like new and the case too . .. . . really good price
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is my second book by Kate Morton and she didn't disappoint. Interesting premise: who was Mom before she was &#34;Mom&#34;. Gave me lots to think about for my own mom! Great pace and well written - kept me hooked and even a few surprises I didn't see coming.
B0000630YA|4.0|I never had found this in a store so it was nice to finally be able to get it here.  The extra song versions are a nice addition to the &#34;album.&#34;  Unfortunately this doesn't play on my my Dell work laptop, even though I listen to CDs all day long.  I am able to hear it on all other CD players - a Toshiba laptop, combo CD / DVD player, and in the car, though.
0062014102|3.0|This isn't a work of scholarly literature by any means. If you can read a scientific treatise while laying on the beach, it's probably not going to rise to the level of peer-reviewed theory vetted to five sigma. Nonetheless, most people read for a combination of learning, enjoyment and to waste time. So treat this as a summer beach paperback for the slightly nerdier you, with time on your hands.<br /><br />Talbot isn't a scientist. And he's certainly no Deepak Chopra (<- that was a joke there), and he can't put you to sleep and wake you back up again like Dr. Stuart Hammeroff, and the book doesn't bore the beejesus out of you like, say, Wuthering Heights, but it is a good yarn. Most parts anyway.<br /><br />I read it in the bathtub over a couple of days during deepest, darkest January. I did get out of the tub once in a while. It held my attention, which isn't saying much since I'm the worst kind of nerd...an engineer. He quotes a lot of oddball stuff. Someone who scrambled lizard brains (while still in the lizard) and found that the lizard still functioned like a lizard was something that I never knew. Learning how holograms are made was nice too. Might try that in the basement sometime. I started letting the water out of the bathtub when he got to the Swamis and Yogis intent on linking Quantum Mechanics via Holography to their dubious abilities.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line for me. And I'm being serious. Talbot wrote this back in the early 90's before he passed away. A lot has happened in the world of Quantum Physics since then to establish some very, very tenuous pointers to non-classic physics as a doorway to understanding the hidden and often misconceived weirdness of existence. It's a book that is about 50% rational and the rest just time wasting beach or bathtub reading.<br /><br />Next up for me is the Hammeroff-Penrose Orch-OR theory while its still bathtub weather, followed some Brian Green and Michio Kaku when I head down to Florida for some much deserved beach time.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I could never find this in a store and it is one of my husband's favorite movies.  The bonus disc was very informative.  We love it!
0316286850|5.0|I love this book. I have brown eyes and blond hair and do my make up the same everyday... till I got this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game and so do my kids.  There are plenty of levels from very easy to incredibly difficult.  It's fun for the whole family.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am extremely fascinated that we are not left alone on this earth and that this life is not it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is another game that I usually play on my phone and having it on my kindle fire is great.  It's a great game to fill waiting times in restaurants, airports, etc or during commercials at home.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and recently viewed the movie.  I recommend reading before viewing!  Both are exceptional and very well done!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book although I didn't think I would at first.  It has a slow start but is impossible to put down once it gets going! Great choice for my first book on my new Kindle fire.
B003Y3GZZY|5.0|I bought these shoes and had them wrapped up to return then I tried them on again. Problem was I thought the sling back was lower than it should be - it didn't feel right. Then I figured that is how it should be. I love them! Get compliments all the time! Very comfortable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie! Best book since twilight! Hope this series will continue at least one more book for an update on their lives with children.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|It's OK work, good really, but be ready to suspend disbelief. In the space of a few days, a man goes from being arrested for murder to leading an international investigation, partly into the dead of a family member. Does not compute!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It is an awesome book love it if you like to read comics try this one. You will love it. I promise
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just as great as every other book Mr. Flynn has written. I love the Mitch Rapp novels. Every book seems to in compass a current event.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Good book to read. Couldn't stop reading once I started.  The end was a surprise. Sorry the ending came too soon.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|great game! only flaw is that it has no way to exit so i have to turn my devise off to leave it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Up until now, I did not know a 'novel' could go so viral with so little word usage after Harry Potter hit the shelves. There's a lot of plot, very little writing. To be honest, this book caught my attention, so Marketing people... hurrah, you succeeded. The author, however... now that's who I'd like to pick a bone with. How the hell can you say that this is writing? It sounds like some scrawls from a high schooler's Diary. I'd also like to add that this book does not have depth. It is a very linear way of writing, with no regards to the complexities of your readers; their character. You need to make something more relatable, while still maintaining a plot. I don't know how many times I felt like chucking this 'Kindle' outa window!!! Utterly ridiculous. To sum it up... the only reason I'm reading this book is because I got caught with my 'fly' down and paid for the damn thing. So there
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. My friend told me to get it and she was right, it is awesome! It is fun but the demons are really scary. I couldn't stop playing  it once I got it. It is almost better than doodle jump. Who am I kidding, it is better than doodle jump!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Slow start, but then was intriguing until the end. Couldn't put it down. Had such a strong reaction to the main characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A book u will not want to put down! Keeps you captivated and up late! There was never a moment you needed a \\" chapter break\\".
B006MW3V6U|5.0|And loved the fact that Amazon made it available in downloadable form as soon as we purchased it!  We waited until we received the DVD, but it was a perk just the same!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey is great.  Great chance to review entire series and watch the episodes that were missed.  Awesome Christmas present!
B00441GYZQ|5.0|So many ups and downs in this movie,actors are great,almost happy ending.Harrison Ford is one of my all time favorite actors,and in this one ,doesn't let you down.
B00AWBNNAG|4.0|This app has directions for a lot of lego things, but not all. However, it is free and seems to be very helpful. It is easy to search for all the instruction booklets and you can download them right there.  I like this app, and I know it will always be helpful.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought it was heartwarming<br />It was so touching I loved please make another one thanks :)<br />Your books are great
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I really enjoyed the story line but found it too long winded...three books would have made one great book.  I found the sex scenes over done,  found my self skipping over a lot of them as they were too repetitive and predictive.
B000FC0O7M|4.0|I am proud of the achievements America has achieved in space. This Book strengthened these impressions further. I learned much about the three programs that led us to the moon. I wanted his thoughts on the Challenger since he was in Mission Control at the time, but he did not give us his thoughts on that.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would give this 10 stars if they were available. The cast is all wonderful, but Maggie Smith is perfect!
0425263916|5.0|What can you to say about a perfect man? In fact, he's not perfect, but his capable to be resilient is amazing and now his target is about a beautiful and submisse woman.<br />Mr. Gideon Cross belongs to our heros pantheon now.
B000T45C6E|1.0|There are two ways to look at this movie.  Either it is a rags to riches story or a story about what is wrong with Amerika. I choose the later.  It shouldn't be this hard to succeed in Amerika, supposedly the richest country in the world.
0425263908|5.0|I love the book.<br />I know some people like to say this book is almost the same as 50 Shades, but readers can find their difference.<br />Gorgeous, sexy, smart, intelligent and dom...Mr. Cross is perfect the way he is. And any woman would like to meet someone like him. Dont you?
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I watched this movie twice in the past two days, and each time it was better than ever. I consider this one of the all-time best movies I have ever purchased from Amazon. Fantastic actors who expressed powerful emotions concerning senior citizens and the ways they faced their loneliness and love. It was a very touching movie, one that I can relate to, and I plan to view it several more times before sharing it with some of my other friends. I look forward to more films in this same genre. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel, Tom Wilkinson, and Bill Nighy are to be commended for outstanding performances.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|Its really nice watch with its price ..<br />No body could believe the price when I told them<br />Looks nice ..very new (( every day ))
1574214276|5.0|The format of this book is perfect for the beginning &#34;tangler&#34; as well as for the more advanced artist.<br /><br />Following a description of what Zentangle is all about, the author starts with 3 patterns to learn.  Then you make a Zentangle from these three patterns.  Then the next day, one learns 3 more patterns from which you can make another Zentangle.  Now you know 6 patterns.  It goes on like this throughout the book.  Interspersed with these patterns, are tips and instructions on shading, color work,<br />Zentangles in Art, and other more advanced instructions.<br /><br />I was surprised how great my Zentangles looked--and I am not close to being an artist.  It's so much fun and relaxing to boot.
B0063IH60K|4.0|only bad feature is ads that pop up when open ap otherwise it is a good way to pass time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book stole my heart. It at times was hard to read, but sky and holder are great characters! I could not put this down!!<br /><br />Thumbs up!
B0071T4BVC|3.0|This is not Paul Mccartney's best work. It is ok and the price was right. If you like old favorites try it out.
0425252868|5.0|On December 20, 1943, Charlie Brown and his crew of the B-17 \\"Ye Olde Pub\\" had just participated in their first bombing raid on Germany.  Their target was the city of Bremen.  Brown's B-17 suffered terrible damage, and most of his crew were either wounded or dead.  The plane had dropped out of formation due to its tremendous damage.  It was highly unlikely that they'd reach their base in England.<br /><br />After a while, a German ME-109 was sighted.  The plane was piloted by Second Lieutenant Franz Stigler, a veteran pilot with many aerial victories to his credit.  Flying closer, Franz was able to see the tremendous damage Brown's plane had endured.  Franz realized that he could easily shoot the plane down.  Instead, he did something extraordinary; he flew alongside the stricken bomber until it was out of the range of German flak batteries.  Franz waved frantically at Brown to try to motion him to head for Sweden, but Brown couldn't understand Franz's gestures.  Instead, Brown flew over the North Sea, heading for England.  Franz returned to his base, certain that the B-17 would never reach England.<br /><br />But reach England Brown and his crew did.  Escorted by a pair of friendly fighters, \\"Ye Olde Pub\\" touched safely down on English soil.  Both men survived the war.<br /><br />This is an excellent book.  Author Adam Makos has done a masterful job of telling this true tale of chivalry, compassion, and sportsmanship.  The reader gets a look into both Franz's and Charlie's lives.  Franz was a successful fighter pilot before he ever encountered Charlie, racking up victories in both North Africa and Italy.  Charlie went on to fly other missions against the Germans after being spared by Franz.<br /><br />I especially liked the final chapters where Franz and Charlie are finally able to meet in person.  Needless to say, it was emotional for each of them, and they remained friends until the end of their lives.<br /><br />I recommend this great book very highly.  As Franzput it, it's easier to be friends than enemies.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Love the movie! It arrived in time for Christmas and I felt that it was excellently priced. :) :) :)
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Th plot of the is amazing the idea and the ending are all sending tears to my eyes right now as I have just finish the series.
1601251556|4.0|I love the size. Not too crazy about it coming folded up and being permanently creased, but it's pretty rad. I bought it for my husband, because we have a humongous battle mat that is just too big. This fits on the table better, and the square sizes are more reasonable. I want to buy another for me and start running D&D!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great to play and even though you seem as though you never go any further, I still love it
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started out a little slow but so many people raved about it so I was  excited to get in there! Lots of twists and turns I didn't expect. The very end paragraphs threw me off and left me wondering and slightly disappointed. Maybe I didn't understand the ending? Overall a great read!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I wanted to go see this movie when it first came out, but for one reason or another, I never got to see it until I purchased it in amazon. I loved it
1451695195|5.0|I really appreciated reading this book.  I have read many books one the subject of NDE (near death experience).  I found Eben's story to be fascinating because it is written from the perspective of a neurosurgeon who did not have any particularly religious beliefs at the time of his NDE.  From his pre-NDE medical/analytical/technical view, there was no quality of life and absolutley no consciousness if the brain failed, and there was no life beyond this one.  Although many patients had shared events with him of what happened when they had been decalred legally dead and then resuscitated, Eben chalked it up to nothing shore of hallucinations or wishful thinking -- never gave it any credibility.  Until it happened to him.  Now he knows.  Read the book if you want the rest of the story.  It's worth it!
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|I know that more than one person is going to be against the one star I gave to this game, but I honestly do not like it and did not find it fun to play. Maybe it is a matter of taste
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Obviously not filmed when blu-ray or hd was available, but the picture quality was higher than I expected. I'd buy &#34;old fims&#34; on blu-ray again
B009329Y30|3.0|The movie at the beginning was ok, the one thing that I really disliked was that you could already know what was going to happen next. To me this movie is great for teenagers that have fantasies that love is just this simple
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This was a pretty good movie.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed because we had to stop watching the first night because about halfway through it would buffer about every 15 seconds.<br /><br />We have crummy internet, but Netflix was working fine that night and I've had good luck watching Amazon movies before. So I think it was an Amazon problem.<br /><br />We sat down to watch the second half of the movie the next night, and fortunately it let us watch 60 minutes of movie even though I only had 45 minutes left in my 24 hours. And we didn't get charged double.<br /><br />I took away 1 star for my trouble. Fortunately we were available to watch the rest the next night. Otherwise I would have wasted my $4 bucks. I also think Amazon should give you more that 24 hours for 4 bucks. Redbox is only a little over a buck a day. But I knew what I was getting when I made my purchase, and it's pretty convenient to rent movies without getting up off the couch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this apps just to try this game and see how it was. It turned out to be fun, but not addictive and as long as you do not spend any real money I think it is more fun to play. The game gives you quarters to play by itself and you really don't have to end up using real money at all.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|I don't really understand the game and how it works so I do not play it often. Maybe just not the game for me
B003SI9WYG|5.0|It had been a really long time since I had seen this movie for the first time on theaters. I rented this movie for my three year old and even though I was more into the movie than her, I know she enjoyed it too. I love this movie.
B009O2XY12|5.0|THis game is a blast to play and is challanging . I like that it has so many different levels to play.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|Pretty good quality. The sound was a bit annoying. It was either too low you couldn;t hear it or way too loud
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game, but if they say it is free, it should be free and you should not have to buy anything to play it. I really like the game but not having to buy. There are alot of free bingo games you can play.  THis one is really fun to play
B0043KK4N6|5.0|The rest of the CD is okay, not memorable.  This was some time ago that I first played it and I don't remember the names of any of the songs.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is very challanging and I really enjoy playing it . IT has lots of levels which if you don't feel like to play a really hard level you can play a easier level. IT is a great game!
B008P1EWIM|2.0|still not  much information. no map option, no forecast detail, no extended 10 or 15 day forecast as I have from AccuWeather, weather channel, or My Weather on my I phone..
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not think the language was required.  Though there was a twisty plot, the characters were distasteful.  GONE GIRL could have been called &#34;PSYCHO BITCH&#34;.
B009C7JS14|1.0|generally worthless, too little information accuweather and weather channel give alot more information. I do not even look at anymore and had to buy the up grade which is not a whole lot better
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Ddefending jjacob- very popular among women, though more to do with the male species, denial is a big part of this bookl
B001CB8NQE|5.0|No problems with the DVDs. Wish the show had another season or a movie, but everything was wrapped up pretty nicely without a big cliffhanger.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Every time I think I have seen the last time travel movie that I will ever want to see it gets done again in some genius way. Very thrilling and very intriguing. I was engaged all the way through the end.
0765325950|5.0|In spite of wondering if there will ever be new content in regards to the lingering political problems that were unresolved (i.e. the outrigger novels that Jordan wanted to write afterward), this was a fantastic ending to an overall satisfying, if wordy, series.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|It's too bad that Charlize Theron had to hold together the whole film, the rest of the crew was a pretty weak performance.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Great movie, enjoyable for all families, outstanding movie , one of the best in the whole ice age series .
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A great story from a unique perspective.  Well worth the time to read. Both enjoyable and thought provoking.  Get the book.
B00632HWOG|2.0|it wont let you check multiple accounts. its ridiculous I have to go to the web rather than use the app on my kindle
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|Product arrived on time, a little earlier than I had expected, which was a good thing and was packaged safely!
0800141806|5.0|Man, Tom Hanks takes the cake in this movie. The music was superb! It brings some nosthalgia from the early 90s. Good flick, Antonio Banderas does really good too playing a gay man. I just did not liked the way it ended.
1449410243|5.0|I bought the book for a cat loving maniac. It is great fun and my friend LOVED it. I'll buy his other books now.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Cinematography so dark and underexposed as to render the film difficult to see. Very cheap and tacky digital shoot.<br />Plot is foolish and a waste of time
B005LAJ16I|5.0|it was a gift. I bought two of them and it was loved by all.  I can't wait for it to come back on. Homeland
B009LDD590|5.0|Even my wife,who usually eschews violence,was cemented to her seat while watching this on pay tv here in Australia.<br />How could anyone not like this operatic,Jacobean take on  the early prohibition years?<br />However ,we hope it is not the last of Nucky,Arthur,Chalky,our errant Federal agent now in the pay of Al,the depicable and self righteous hypocrite Margaret,and the rest of the damaged,revenging insane,greedy plotting gangsters,corrupt politicians and molls.<br />Boardwalk Empire deserves to go on its way through the prohibition years.Dare we hope the 'untouchables' and Hoover will arrive eventually with their machine guns too?<br />The sources are so rich and the quality of the writing and production are so good that the series could go on and on to at least series six or seven like 'Breaking Bad'.<br />How good of HBO to give usanother timely parable.Things haven't changed since their other fictional series 'Rome'.Life is still about survival and all the rest is the thin veneer of civilisation  and education which keeps us from complete anarchy.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|In view of the Occupy movement and the tremendous number of citizens who have lost homes as a result of the greed  of Bankers like Angelo Mozillo who never went to jail, the issues raised by Steinbeck seem very pertinent in 2013, almost  as much as in 1939 when he published the book.  It is true that there are more safety nets now for people, though some in our country are trying to get rid of these.  As a result of the social legislation of the 1930's there  is unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children, protection of  an individual's assets in banks that fail.  Why would our  legislators want to  allow these to disappear to save a few bucks when they continue to rent public lands for exploration to huge pick companies @$5.00 an acre, same with mining rights to  mining companies, depriving the US government from receiving justified revenue, no royalty rights???
1451629192|5.0|After reading Shattered Innocence I had to read S Stolen Life which made Jaycee's story even more real--a real eye opener
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel is set in my own home town if Newton Massachusetts so it was interesting to picture in my head the actual physical sites described in the book.  I thought the character of Laurie the wife not drawn out enough and during the trial of her son for murder, I found it implausible that Laurie's parents who are said to be psychiatrists, are not more visible during the murder trial of their grandson.  No exchange takes pace between Laurie and her parents throughout the book.  It seemed gratuitous to state  that they were psychiatrist and  describe Laurie's interest in discussing feelings and emotions, yet, they do not appear to support her.  Nevertheless, I liked the book.  I thought it very tense.  After The trial is over I was left with a feeling of foreboding that another disaster would follow.
1426308469|4.0|I rated this four stars because younger children can't 'read' the book. But the pictures are great. I recommend this book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in awhile! Never a dull moment and so many things get thrown at you that you never see coming!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Wonderful book, really good love story and suspense reading.  The Pact was so real to life, this could really happen to any family.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love this collection!  Saw them on CBS one Saturday morning and have been listening to them ever since.  So creative, beautiful, and makes me both smile and cry!
0486474917|5.0|I just finished reading this on my Kindle app and loved it. This collection was very interesting and entertaining to read. I enjoyed each story in this collection but, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, and The Adventure of the Copper Beeches were my favorite.<br /><br />This is what I would consider a must read for any fan of Sherlock Holmes. SO many of these stories are absolutely amazing and some are a bit on the slow side, but I feel Doyle really shows his talents in this volume. Those three stories I mentioned earlier are my clear favorites but I loved every one of the stories in this which is why I gave it 5 stars, please check it out for yourself, I bet you will be hooked on the worlds best consulting detective.
B0091LS07E|2.0|Did not care for her choice of songs other than Girl on Fire.  Very disappointed in this particular product.  Alicia Keys can do better.
030758836X|4.0|I cannot stress enough how messed up this book is; but it is messed up in a good way. Gillian Flynn takes the reader through the lives of two people who are the most explosive, messed up, and just plain evil I have meet in literature. These characters are so horrible that you find them fascinating because you want to know what they will do next. This is a tough book to talk about because I am so afraid I will give something away.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn, is very good at twist and turns, but she has also wowed me with her ability to write an in depth character, that whether you like them or hate them, these characters are going to be hard to forget. Gone Girl is loaded with twist and turns that kept me going and held my attention. I read this after my wife so it was great to be able to talk about this book with her. Some of the situations in this book are so shocking that a person would do this that my level of interest never dipped once.<br /><br />Of course this is about the wife of Nick Dunne, missing and everyone in town pointing the finger at Nick. I will say that we the reader find out what happens a little over halfway through the book and all I could think of was, what on earth with happen in the rest of it. I was not prepared for the ride Gillian Flynn took us on after that. It was like the whole book was building to that little bit of info and then the ride actually started. If you are looking for a good read that is intriguing and doesn't let up till the very end this is defiantly the book for you. The only cautionary word I must throw out there is that there is a lot of offensive language in this book so if you are not ok with that type of dialog I might suggest reading something else, but this story is so well written that it was very easy to look past all that.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|There are so many insights presented here which can be applied to child growth and development for children of dysfunctional situations. A should read for educators.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The movie skips and then stops in the middle, again another gift and a waste of money. very upset with this purchase.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie helped uplift the romantic comedy genre and give it some unexpected twist. I enjoyed this movie greatly and recommend this movie to everyone!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Product was as ordered and arrived very quick in time for Christmas which I was what I was hoping for since I was a late shopper!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This will become a classic romantic comedy for all those softies out there. The dynamic relationship between Kunis and Timberlake is undeniable. Its definitely a must see if you have not already.
B009DT424Y|2.0|The Bluetooth syncs' ok but the sound quality is poor. I set it aside for now. Will try it again when I have more time.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I have an extremely soft spot for romantic comedies and this caught my eye in the theatre so I had to purchase the movie. The cast is adorable and eventually I read the book.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Lovely read, fast read, or you can make it a slow read...lol.  Either way, it is a wonderful book to visit.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game offers a long demo period in which you can get a real feel for the game. However,  you will be prompted to pay once this trial period is over. I believe that it is worth paying a couple of dollars. The game is thrilling, mysterious, and challenging. It is not overly complicated and you have the option to ask for hints if you are truly stuck. The game also offers a bonus adventure after completing the game. You have to go under extras. There are options to listen to the music and replay the hidden object game. Its a game that doesn't end. You can find more to do. I hope there is a sequel to this game. Thanks G5!!!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|How can you not like  a book about ThIS american hero?.  I'll read it 9 times because he is worth it

Plantars Fasciitis in both feet, arthritis and fibromyalgia over the entire body.  Husband with prostate cancer  due to agent orange poisioning during vietnam.  Not sure this book can help us.  We love each other.  If it would work for one of us...lay it on me man

B0058YPGSY|5.0|I love Sons of Anarchy. I can't wait for the next season! They are such a brilliant cast of characters! There's nothing else like it out there!
B005LAII80|5.0|Honestly, this movie is a great little film, even for not Dredd fans.<br /><br />Karl Urban is fantastic as Dredd and Olivia T is excellent as Anderson. Its a 'small' feeling movie due to the budget, but it is done by people that are clearly fans of the comic books.<br /><br />it is a tragedy that it didn't do well in the theaters, and I am very hopeful that it does well in sales and gains a cult following like The Chronicles of Riddick, so that we might once again see Urban as Dredd.<br /><br />Kudos to the film makers for taking a risk. I hope movie fans will support this film in DVD sales and rentals, because it definitely deserves to be rewarded.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Much more frightening than your run of the mill scary movie but it's disappointing to pay $1.99 on a TV show that was free months prior;-(
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked this book a lot I thought the plot was great and not predictable . It kept me engaged till the end.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was an easy read with a decent amount of humor.  It was fun light reading.
0525953728|4.0|I read this book mainly because I was fascinated by the story of the raid on the Pakistan compound and I was excited for Kathryn Bigelow's \\"Zero Dark Thirty.\\" I finished the book shortly after viewing the movie, and while I can say the book was a bit slow for the first half or so, it was worth it when reading about the raid. The final half of \\"No Easy Day\\" was a very intense read, and the details were transitioned perfectly to the movie. I was very pleased with this book, and it's refreshing to read a book about the truth of the mission that killed Usama bin Laden, and to get one with this much intensity. Very reccomended book here.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother who is a big fan. she loved it very much.she can't stop talking about it.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|I bought this movie for my little granddaughter but it is good for the whole family. It has great songs & was very colorful.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. It will stretch and grow your vocabulary which is a fringe benefit to reading one of the most beautiful books of all time. You can often forget you are learning history as it is told through such compelling and well developed characters.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this on PBS before I ordered the DVD for my daughter.  It was wonderful. We all enjoyed this show.
0553801473|5.0|I read the first three books in high school and became engrossed in this world. Last month (10 years later) I just finished a one year odyssey of rereading the first three books and the most recent two. The story is gritty, brutal, epic, and inspiring. The action slows down in 4 and 5, and at first I did not really like this slowing of pace. But the more I thought about it, the more it grew on me. It showed the devastation that the events in the first 3 books wrought on Westeros and the characters within it. They became scattered across the world, fighting for survival and their place in the world. I particularly liked the sections on Arya and Jon and think that these story-lines illustrate this idea quite well...reforming your identity to fit the new environment/context they they find themselves in. I look forward to future Martin works in this series.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I was big fan of the first three movies. This was a huge letdown. Average acting, little action..... Don't waste two hours of your time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved it!! Can't wait for the second one! Going to buy it right now :) I would definitely recommend the book to a friend.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting from the first page to the last. It was a real eye opener to the possibilities that may lie ahead.  I would recomend this novel to all readers that  love action and terroism stories.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Though originally written as 5 short stories this is really just one book. A very good book around a world reduced to one underground silo. I don't want to say too much as I don't want to give anything away. One of the best things about this book is slowly learning more and having the world grow with each new section.<br /><br />The first book was probably the best in terms of atmosphere. It was gripping and thrilling then suddenly it was over and there were so many questions. Through each of the subsequent books much was revealed but there were also new questions each time.<br /><br />This is a really good book and I can't wait to read the prequels to learn how it all being. Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Nice to see Stephen King doing sci-fi. Not for hard sci-fi lovers though. This read more like a love story but the depth of his research into the 50s and 60 shines through and holds your interest.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i loved it!  i didn't want to put it down. this is one of the best books i've read and Holder OMG!! that guy is awesome..  yes i would recommend this book.
030758836X|2.0|They say misery loves company.  I'm convinced that is why this book is getting so much chatter.  It has to be a case of, \\"I wasted a week of my life riding this roller coster, so I'll talk it up and drag others in\\".  The characters are not likeable.  You keep waiting to feel drawn to one, but every time you get close, the author ruins them for you.  Amy is just a beautiful psycho.  Nick is hollow.  Even the outlying characters that you hope maybe you can really get into just never develop anything likeable.<br /><br />It is a wild, twisty read, packed with all sorts of \\"didn't see that coming\\"s.  But not in a good way.  More of a smack yourself in the forehead like \\"really?\\" and then more of the same over and over again.  I envision the author writing this drunk.  I almost gave up reading it at least 6 times.  Through some coaxing of friends that read it, and lots of \\"just wait\\"s, I trudged on.  I was never on the edge of my seat, more like at the very end of the bandaid that you just can't wait til someone rips off.<br /><br />If you are looking for a thriller, sorry to disagree with all the hype, this isn't it.  If you want to feel that feeling like you just stepped off the tilt-a-whirl after eating too much fried dough, then read on.  I literally flipped through my Kindle expecting another chapter to give some sort of ending that made any sense.  Even a good HOLY CRAP, would have been better than the fizzle the book leaves you with.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is very good with the graphics and very time consuming love seeing all the different kinds of animals . There's one thing I would like some help on tho I can't seem to find if their is any that is some grass can't find it in the shop only dirt paths ??
B008P9M614|5.0|I love my House DVD series I was so excited to get it I watch a disc a day it came quickly and was brand new as promised
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great romance and suspense at the same time!  Really show how important trust and honesty are in relationships.  I'm not a big romance novel reader but this book I thoroughly enjoyed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting and it's free! I'd pay at least $4 for it. I recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like ice age (if you find this review helpful, come to my village &quot;Pineapple&quot;)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|GREAT!Jeff did as good as he does with all his other books!I hope Jeff makes a new Wimpy kid soon!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|If you loved The Hunger Games, you'll love this! It's the same resistance with a great twist. I LOVE LOVE LOVED it!
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Absolutely amazing. i loved it. It only buffered a little. but i rented it so. i loved it &#60;3 amazing cheap too.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I think as the king of pirates. There should be away you can attack the actual planet,and gain control of the planet for your clan. and conquer enemy palaces , rummage through the star port,fight people in the spice bars its really BORING when all the factions hate you. You cant sell anything,visit any shops, so I just want go to the palace and make amends oh wait you cant get pardoned because they wont even talk to me. SO all i wanna do is take over the planet and claim my title as the KING but that is not an option.I NEED CONTROL OF THE UNIVERSE.
B00795P4EG|4.0|This is a great product. If you are a picture taker and have those oops moments this is for you.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I liked this book it was very good. I think Lena was ridiculous though but it is understandable to a certain extent. And I hope rid doesn't do what ever she is planning to do. Seems fishy.
0399157565|3.0|Perhaps it is me, but the story quality seems to be declining as this series continues.  I loved her early work, but have been less impressed the last few books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this.  It was a very thought provoking and emotion evoking read, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the Wool series.
1401322786|5.0|I read this book nearly a week ago and it is still lingering in my mind. What is time and why do we wish it away?<br /><br />This is a story about Father Time and two people on earth who are wishing time away or wishing for more time. Father Time? Silly? No, Albom creates his character as the ancient human who first discovered how to mark time, starting with a stick in the sand. He becomes obsessed by time and ... well to tell you more would likely ruin the story for you.<br /><br />Mitch Albom's books always have an enduring message. This one leaves you thinking about all the times in your life that you wished your life away (by this time next week I'll be finished with ...) instead of savoring all the time we have here on this earth, savor it as though each moment is your last.<br /><br />It's a slim book with an important message.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|Provides views from entirely different angle.  Provides good fodder for individual contemplation and group discussion. It was recommended to me by a friend, I shall pass on the favor.
B001P06GX4|4.0|We now have family game night, where everyone can participate. As a parent, I like it because it teaches strategy and also because I don't get bored (hello, CandyLand).
B00008DDXB|5.0|Bought for brother in law who had never seen Harry Potter and didn't know who he was. Bro in law is a big sci-fi fan so it was a great buy
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|There's no story to this film.  Jones and Streep are great actors, but nothing happens during the whole thing.  We got the feeling that all of the important parts of the movie got deleted.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I don't care who you are, you gotta love Harry and his friends. bought for brother in law who had never seen a movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In my opinion, Stephen King is one of the the greatest and most underrated writers in the English language.  This book is perhaps his best so far and a wonderful display of a master at the top of his craft.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun especially ones like temple run brave nothing is wrong with this game I love it and I hope you like it too
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the present dayness of it.  The references were aimed right at my 40 something demographic.  Ending was ok but story worth reading regardless.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|It's a classic.  It's got some of Led Zeppelin's best music.  This music is the beginning of all the rock music we know today.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I choose 5 stars as I felt the book was great!  It kept my interest, was well written and couldn't put it down.  That's five stars as far as I am concerned.  Can't wait to read the next in the series.
B004RFWZNY|4.0|It is a well produced dvd.  The Allman Brothers can't miss.  It is a wonderful experience except the last song is Whipping Post and the dvd ended before Greg could sing the last line.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise. Had I known what the subject of this story was before hand I would not have read it. BUT- I am glad I did... The characters are great!!!.
B0000636NQ|4.0|an oldie but goodie from the fastest guitar slinger (at that time) &#34;I'd love to change the world&#34; classic!! Alvin could and still can burn up the fretboard or squeeze feelings on slow blues
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a very addicting game but it takes forever to load at times. 5 stars if it wouldn't take forever
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The characters were very genuine and vulnerable; the language,however makes you forget that the book is set in the late 1800's.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Spielberg has finally made a film that gives him a place in the pantheon.  Any American who cannot connect with this film on the deepest, most emotional level possible needs to start life over and pay attention.  This is visceral, emotional, gut level filmmaking that connects with the \\"single greatest story that actually happened\\" on a level that links civilization with soul.<br /><br />This is powerful, deeply felt, authentic, and written with exploding ink.  Here we see the best of man defined as exactly the opposite of the Disney treacle a few pathetic clowns on here (looking for attention or just plain dumb) have described.  This is a film that leaps into the darkest questions about human purpose and the path towards meaning.<br /><br />Spielberg, Tony Kushner, Daniel Day Lewis, and team explore the capabilities of cinema to examine the meaning of honor, the nature of human capability, and the mysterious art of cinema itself This is film of a million shades of grey: truly cinematic music.  If it were a composer it would be Brahms--  hardly designed to please fools.  But for those prepared to listen: infinitely rewarding.<br /><br />John Ford, William Wyler....and now Spielberg.  American masters who capture a truly American point of view.  Lincoln is the single most honorable film made in--and about-- America since the golden age of cinema.  Sorry-- but if you don't get that it's your own fault.  And it is a moral fault: as a citizen you're inadequate if you can't learn the meanings here.  It's your duty.  But this film is anything but \\"dutiful\\" and \\"earnest.\\"  It's electric, grand, and big as the country it celebrates.<br /><br />(Argo?  Entertaining, skillful,  funny, but ultimately just a cheap chase third act designed to please the half awake).  Lincoln soars a million miles above every other film this year (a great year, too: one that produced wondrous delights like \\"Life of Pi\\" and \\"Moonlight Kingdom.\\"  But then again-- Lincoln soars beyond any other American film made in decades.<br /><br />Again, I know some people out there don't get it.  But America produces both great souls and utter imbeciles.  If you're the latter, you won't like this film.  You'll say it's \\"talky.\\"  And you probably would have voted against the thirteenth amendment.
B0039O8AQK|3.0|1984 stays mainly true to the novel save in a few areas. Julia is more intellectually formed in the movie (closer to Winston I) than in the book where she is interested in expression through rebellion. Also, the emotional range of the characters, I think, was underplayed. As much as the characters were conveyed through imagery the novel was much more thought-driven than visually desciprive--save at the Ministry of Love. Thereofre I would have liked to have seen more internal monologue to explain the world of Big Brother to the audience. I do appreciate that they used a great deal of lines from the book at the Ministry of Love between Winston and O'Brien and John Hurt plays a double-plus good Winston.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|It's a fun read. Easy to get through. Likable characters. The storyline is all too familiar. Good girl, bad boy... over used. I enjoyed it though.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I'm a huge sex and the city fan and this was the perfect movie. Loved the first one and loved this one too.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love this game -  and with the setup of Star wars it is even better.  Cannot wait for the next version.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I would like it to have the flute since I used to play the flute<br />But other than that i love it
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This movie had no real plot and went nowhere. The ending seemed to be in the middle of the movie and left me wondering if they just ran out of film at that point or realized what a poor story line they had going and just decided to quit.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works exactly as advertised. Lets me connect my android tablet and work as if i'm at my desktop. Thank you devs. Brilliant.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyed the style in which the book was written and the plot was something new and interesting. Made me pick up other Gillian Flynn books.
B002NUULNG|5.0|Great Update to an Anime Classic!  I already owned the original Ghost in the Shell on DVD, but after viewing some clips of 2.0, I decided to buy the 2.0 Blu-Ray version. Great upgrades to the old CGI scenes;  the updated orchestration; and the addition of the DTS soundtrack. Very pleased with my purchase!
B009KYXEY6|4.0|Not much more I can say, other than \\"Paradise\\" builds perfectly upon her debut \\"Born To Die\\" released earlier in 2012 - advancing all of the themes and musical stylings to the next level.<br /><br />Ideally this should've been a separate, proper 2nd EP release, because it does have enough substance to stand on it's own. For that reason, I'm docking it 1 star - but I'm sure it's the label's fault - so it's not an artistic criticism.<br /><br />Or just do like I did and buy them both separately on vinyl, so each work is represented as intended.<br /><br />Lana Del Rey is a true pop artiste of our time, and I eagerly anticipate her further development.
B000YHG72E|5.0|New holiday classic in our house. Love will Ferrell and Zooey is in it too! ! ! ! ! !
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I was really pleased with this purchase.  It came very quickly and was everthing I expected.  My daughter watches it continuously and there have not been any problems with the movie.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|A must see for any lover of crime dramas! This is an excellent film that deserves to be in your library! Chris M.
B002IXA5KW|4.0|There really isn't a great reason for me to like this movie. I like the look, I love the graphic novel, I think the movie is entertaining and does a great job of creating an understandable version of the book. Or I should say a more accessible.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Anyone that understands numbers (don't care about what kind of numbers), loves baseball, loves fantasy games, or simply enjoys an old idea with a fresh application will appreciate this book.<br /><br />Overvalued:  Billy beans interpretation of his own setbacks.<br /><br />Undervalued:  The need for a go to guy.  Regardless, of the stats, every successful organization has it's \\"git'er done individuals\\".  If you don't have a couple of those to balance the equation.  Well, you get it.<br /><br />If you are any kind of entrepreneur, business management, hot dog stand owner you will find yourself comparison reading as you go. It's almost annoying.<br /><br />Absorbing, intellectually stimulating, captures the imagination, difficult to put down.<br /><br />MAY HAVE TO REREAD IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
B00003CXBK|5.0|We had seen this movie before, amazing story great characters, very well put together. It is a little violent for the younger children to watch but we are old and still love it. would definitely recommend.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|My favorite movies in Blue Ray format. Although Shai Labuff in that good of resolution its unsettling. Optimus never looked so good
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|My family absolutely loves this movie, 1 1/2 yr old all the way up to 27 yr old. We were all glued to the tv for what felt like not long enough, wish the movie would keep going. Would recommend to anyone who likes cartoons, or clean anime.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great story line narrated by the dog...some fun, some sad chapters.  Could have done without tear jerker ones.<br />Quite interesting.
0345803485|1.0|So - after all the fuss about this book I've decided to check it out. What a waste of time! Don't get me wrong I didn't mind the subject at hand but the way this book has been written is comic! The choice of words to describe the anatomical parts of the body such as 'down there' are ridicuolous. How old is the author?!?? I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased the book. My advice - don't waste your time!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Short, fast read but decent addition to the Rapp series. Rapp lovers will enjoy the continued efforts of the author.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|It's funny that some see Sr. Aloysius as the bad guy here: but perhaps understanding the driving force behind the movie relies on a key group of people. These people are Catholic (or have recently left the church) and can understand the way the hierarchy, the silencing, the movement instead of termination. These people aren't so naive as to think that the church is only full of good people (even at the higher levels) and understand the position that Sr. Aloysius is in.<br /><br />Anyway, it was good.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|This movie definitely brought Mickey Rourke back from the darkness. Even people who do not like him, can't deny he nailed it in this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and I are always competing who has the highest score. You actually feel as if you are running for your life.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Download this because the movie just came out, I wanted to read the book first.  Difficult read, slow to get started.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|The 20 second penalty is annoying. Frequently I have been given the penalty for just searching the room. The puzzles kind of fall into a pattern. Same puzzle, different items. I give it a 3 because of the graphics and the fact that I am playing it for free as it was Amazon's free app of the day at some point.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Life changing. I'm currently going through a divorce and this book is helping me cope with it everyday. A must read
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the way the author keeps me reading, love the story and the characters, do not wait until the movie comes out because, as always, it will not be the same. And while you read you feel like you are living the story with the characters.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I've read every Morgan Rice book I can get my hands on, and loved them all.  This is quite possibly my favorite (so far.) Morgan has created an enticing world for us to explore, and so many interesting characters to meet along the way.  Exactly what I look for when I'm choosing a new novel in which to immerse myself.  I can't wait to read book #2, and one of the awesome things about Morgan Rice books is the frequency with which they are released.  Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Grat book to have at home and share it with your husband or wife. Besides spicing things up, it gets your husband to come home early in order to try some of the fun things mentioned in the book.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Amazing book . A MUST READ . (: I love this whole entire series . All I have to say is wow .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read it in less than 24 hours, I got so addicted that I bought the other two. Amazing story, sensual moments that make you warm your chair. It is a great book to share with your spouse and it does spice things up in the bedroom.
B003E88TKS|5.0|This movie wasn't so much about what I expected, people firing people, tough job, etc. Of course that was a part of the movie, but it had much more depth, substance, and twists as well. I would recommend this movie. I tought I waited way to long to see it, but glad I did!
B004J4WL50|5.0|Blake takes you in a great journey and explains what he has done and how he did it. It is an amazing story and an example to follow. I love what Blake has done, I bought a book for every member in my family and we all own at least five pairs of TOMS shoes. It is a book that motivates you to help others.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|This was not at all what I expected.  I missed the part that informed that it is a marvel product.  I bought it for my husband who is an avid western fan.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I think the worth of this headset is under $65, maybe $70.<br />The sound quality is great,  the bass is good (I think it cold be s little better). This headset has got an Audio Expander feature that let the headset simulate surround sound. But I think the sound is better with the expander feature off.<br />This is a great headset but to me it has two Cons:<br /><br />1)It has a hissing sound when the USB is plugged in.<br />This is not a big deal to me.You get used to it, but it's not going to appeal to some people. Maybe is just my headset but when I turn the Expander to ON the hissing sound is a little bit louder.<br /><br />2)They are not noise cancelling.<br />This headset doesn't really try to cancel any background noise. If you were in game in a quiet part you'd easily head anyone talking right next to you. My brother has a Skullcandy Gaming Headset that cost around the same price and they do a superb job at cancelling noise.<br /><br />Everything else with this headset is great. I'm considering buying the DSS2 processor.<br />Again, I think the worth of this headset is $60-70 because of those 2 things: hissing noise and non-noise-cancelling capability.<br />If you can try other headsets that seem better I'd say go ahead. But if you kinda got stuck with this one, then  you'll eventually love it. The sound is really great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an amazing book.  Had me so hooked I had urges to read while driving! Lol The end did suck though.  Felt like she just wanted to hurry up and end it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I can't look at my teddy bears the same. I like &#34;Ted&#34;, but its a humor that I think can hit or miss some audiences. Ted owns the show...Mark Wahlberg was ok. I am not use to Mark in this type of genre.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|At first I thought this book would be just another stupid \\"Vegas Wedding\\" story. It most definitely was not. The whole story line throws you for a loop, but as soon as the intimacy and emotions are laid out, you can't help but fall in love too.  This is a must read! Bravo, Mira Lyn Kelly :)
B0081L391C|5.0|LMAO...I started watching this moving on the plane and had to come home and finish watching it. I was skeptical about this moving and didn't bother to watch it in the theater, but was happy that I did end up seeing it now. It is not a type of humor for everyone...it is like Will Ferrell humor is not for everyone.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|broken up story line hard to follow, not Bruce Willis finest. Future story dealing with Blulder busses? If they can transport someone, why not to mediaval time?
B0096HIEE2|5.0|It was a sexy movie that had some lessons to it, however I am not a big fan of how it ended, it was awkward ending and I felt as if it took away from it being an even better movie.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A rich, multi-layered tapestry of dark and brilliant threads artfully woven to create and to ultimately solve an intriguing mystery.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I would recommend this book and series to anyone that enjoys reading about Greek mythology. I sure loved it And I hope you do too!
0345803485|4.0|I read this book expecting complete and total trash, due to all the bad talk about it. It IS about abuse and a woman accepting abuse simply because she thinks the man really loves her, even though he admits to enjoying hurting women. I hated that part. If the author had only made him into BDSM rather than abusive, this would likely have been an awesome, steamy romance rather than a book about a woman falling in love with her overprotective, abusive stalking (yes, Christian is a stalker, no matter what people say). Regardless, the sex scenes are hot, and Christian's tenderness with Ana in the moments he isn't abusing her is very romantic. I just don't want people to read this book and think its okay for men to treat women like that simply because they're \\"into BDSM\\". There's a difference between BDSM and outright abuse, and Christian is abusive. I have been the submissive in a D/S relationship, and it is NOTHING like the relationship between Christian and Ana. It is a relationship based on total trust between one another. That said, there ARE parts of the book that portray BDSM properly, such as safewords and hard limits and, to a certain extent, contracts.<br /><br />I know this started out as Twilight fanfiction, and that is almost unbelievable. I didn't HATE Twilight, but this is, shockingly, much better than the story it was based upon. If you can get past the abusive undertones and just read the story for what it is (a strange, shocking romance) then you'll like it. I am a woman myself and enjoyed the book once Christian stopped abusing Ana so much. I did almost throw the book away after reading the belt scene, however.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Me I need an app that will offer everything Microsoft word can and mabey more. But this is not worth $15! Its barely worth $1! I need a translator to come along because one of my charactors speak spanish, another french and german. I onky know english! I'm not paying $5 for fonts eather.  I need something on my fire that is productive while my laptop is on the mend and this ain't it. Mabey if it had clip-art, translate, and fonts FREE it would be but nope. I dont reacmend this to authors that need any of that or would like it to sync automatically. Nope dosn't do that eatheir
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I like this game for its puzzles. My son likes the Om-Nom stories. They cause him to fall over laughing, and he's only 2. He has also learned how to \\"Cut the Rope\\" and play with the whoopee cushion balloons on the game, which he finds hilarious as well.<br /><br />I compete with my fiance on who can get the most stars the fastest.<br /><br />Great game and well worth the 99 cents.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|The highest praise I can give this book is that its conclusions are obvious and self-evident.  Any fool could arrive at &#34;antifragility&#34; by himself.  For some reason, though, I hadn't.<br />I bought it on Kindle and now wish I'd bought the hardcover.  Oh, the concavity.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was very emotional and had happy moments and sad ones. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read
0316232955|5.0|I love this book! I got this book because of Chris Colfer. People should read this book then watch the movie.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I thought it was great to see the original ending. It's obvious they spent a lot of time and energy on it. I prefer the sappy ending, but this disk has both, so depending on my mood I can choose which one I want to see.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down loved it. Just the right amount of emotion. Can't wait to read the next book soon
B007SGM084|5.0|Great series I love Christian and Ana. Sexy love scenes great read. Would recommend this book to anyone. Very well written
B008XG1X18|5.0|It works perfectly on my kindle fire. I honestly like using the app more than going to the website. It's great! Everything you can do on the website, you can do in the app. Best app so far!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|So love this movies, I got them fast, i have no complaints.. Packing was perfect not to big or small , thank you,
B008458O3S|5.0|This little game is a great time killer. I have yet to finish all of the levels but each one gets harder. Great game to challenge your brain.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This was required reading in English Lit , in High School.<br />Now that I am 72, it is like reading a new book, wonderful
B0096C7QF0|5.0|If you like Joe you will LOVE this album!!!!!!!!!  Crank up the volume and let it rip! What a player he is!!!
0307596885|5.0|I loathe this may be her final tome, but it is a great one! The end section features stories of a more personal nature, a real treat. Always love her work and this book is no exception!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was my first NIcholas Sparks book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A story about love with some mystery too.  Overall a good read.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Interesting, but weak the last third . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
057809665X|1.0|This book could use some very basic editing!  For a book on communication, the poor writing style was beyond distracting.
B000W94FE6|5.0|This book should be read by people that want to  Understand  Human behaviuor ........... . . . . . .
0807014273|5.0|This is written by a psychiatrist that knows more about suffering than most of us will ever know. This book document his experiential experience of being a concentration camp survivor and how this experienced influenced his logostherapy. It's an easy reead but very interesting.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This is a cool game but I found it very hard to control. Adjusting sensitivity on tilt control helps but I did not land that thing yet.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got this for my son and he just loved it!! I highly recommend this! Three great movies and a great price!!
0375851569|5.0|Getting this collection was a great idea for my son. He's loves the rhyming and he loves how I read it to him in such an animated way. The colors leap out at him and he's trying to say the words with me now. These books will grow with him. Like they grew with me when I was a child. A very good collection set.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Great movie, arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Will buy again from this seller.  Makes a great gift.  I want my nieces and nephews to have all the Disney movies and this is a great place to buy them.
0805047905|4.0|I'm building my son's book collection now that's he quickly getting to that age where he likes for me to read to him. This book is always a classic and the rhyming gets his attention really quickly. He enjoys flipping the pages and pointing at the pictures as I read to him. And because it's a board book it can withstand his chewing habit. When he gets older I'll get him the bigger version.
B000IVW25M|5.0|Bought this for my daughter, she collects the Disney movies.  Everyone that collects needs this movie being the first feature length Disney movie.  Really good movie.  Arrive in great condition, would highly recommend this item and seller.
0399226907|5.0|This little classic was a joy to read to my son, who marveled at the colors and laughed when he noticed the wholes in the book. Now I just need to buy the plushy caterpillar for him so that when we finish the book he can see the caterpillar responsible for eating the book. A must have for any child and parent.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Great movie, arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Will buy again from this seller.  Makes a great gift.  I want my nieces and nephews to have all the Disney movies and this is a great place to buy them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book so much!! It had the perfect integration of romance and survival skills!! Can't wait to read  Mocking Jay!!
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is alot like 50 shades!! But its still a good read!! Enjoyed reading them looking forward to next book.
B0030MM68O|4.0|I would recommend it for anyone who does not mind a good tear-jerker! Although I have not have many first-hand experiences with military life and what it can do to people I could appreciate that this was written and directed by a woman. It really breeches the male psyche.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The writing style really allowed me to understand how the main character was thinking. I read it in a day and a half, so it's an easy read.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|i bought this for my son and he loves it...as all other Lego kits. The best part is that he can actually play with it unlike the Super Star Destroyer he just completed. GREAT STUFF!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I wanted to read this because of the hype about it, but was really disappointed. Not only because it was unadulturated sex throughout the book, but because the story line was vague. Am not sure I'd recommend it to anyone, found myself yawning through most of the chapters.
B0097PW7H8|1.0|Give my volume back! I toght  my battery was low so I enabled volume but I can't get it back and they said I can cause I able my sync back
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very useful thing to have. I expect it to be useful in the future for reference and just randomly looking up words.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I loved this book. It had many ups, downs, twists, turns, and surprises. Although I suggest you read beautiful creatures first!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is incredible for kindle fire hd ! It really doesn't work good for phones like: Android, iPhone,ipod, etc. But it is perfect for a kindle fire hd or any other kindle
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It wasn't the best book in the series but it does make me happy because there hasn't been any good wimpy kid books in a while and this was one of his better one
B00A80SHFM|1.0|The sound was terrible at the movie theater and I thought they butchered it there. So I listened through this soundtrack. I will keep it short since others said it before me. If you care about the music part of this musical, get a different version. I've heard and own several and they are all better.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is probably my favorite. Charlie is such a remarkable character and such a relatable one too. This is a story of his first year of high school, his first kiss, his first love, and on top of it,his first true friendship. I recommend this book to anyone I know.
B003Q6D2B4|1.0|This DVD is unlabeled and looks like it may be a pirated copy; whether it is or is not, I am returning a second one, for the same reasons; both DVDs break up, black out, skip. I returned the first one and received a replacement; can't explain why I ordered a second copy, except that I've never had this problem with Amazon. Anyway, don't order this title; I tried twice and both times I received a piece of garbage.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is by far the best trilogy I have ever read. I find myself smiling for Ana and Christian at all times. The plot of these books are fantastic. I couldn't put them down. They're definitely a must read!
1439107955|5.0|What an extraordinary accomplishment this book represents.  The author weaves the quest to define, understand and treat cancer in its infinite guises with the serendipity, doggedness, imagination, frustrations, and human failings and triumphs of doctors, researches and patients.  In the end, perhaps the most vivid portrait to emerge from this \\"biography\\" [the author's title) is that the face of cancer cannot be rendered clearly.  Its manifestations are myriad and its cure elusive.  There is no magic bullet for a moving target.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like it this is great for waiting at an appointment, or waiting f for some one to arrive. Great brain workout site to keep the Alzheimer's away.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I got one of these OEM with my el-cheapo 55-200 f4.5 zoom, and liked the ability to have lenses off my body and capped. This one worked like a charm for just that, to my knowledge this fits almost every nikkor f mount lens in existence.
B00079ZACM|5.0|Excellent choice for my husband!  He lives this film with the original cast...the best!!  I would recommend it over some of the newer versions.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Last Monday I WENT TO THE gala opening tonight of LES MISERABLES with Gorm Gylterud and let me tell you that it is a epic drama spectacular proportions and production values!<br /><br /> It is like Andrew Lloyd Webber(Evita 1996 and The Phantom of the Opera 2004) but WITH intelligence....<br /><br /> The first and last half are certainly the best; the middle DOES outstay its welcome at times... but on the whole it is a beautiful cinematic transcription of the famous French musical....<br /><br /> To my mind it will be a landmark in the genre of the musical film.<br /><br /> The audience indeed applauded after various experiences of catharsis.....<br /><br /> Anne Hathaway bring memories back to Falconetti as Joan of Arc 1928 and Marion Cotillard as Piaf in La Mome:-)<br /><br /> Her artistry is indeed a treasure to behold.... as is Hugh Jackman in the first half..... it is a pending pain to see these two.. their involvement in their characters are complete.<br /><br /> A major letdown are the Thenardiers.... On stage they are played with vigour, color and camp; Helena Bonham Carter and Sashca Baron Cohen let us totally down in their low key interpretations....<br /><br />They audience cheered and left silently and exhausted after an almost 3 hour run
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Wraps it up very nicely. Great trilogy, intense, powerful, and terrific all rolled into one. These 3 books will be classics down the road.
0345534379|4.0|The book is a great gift for my son each year. He enjoys reading the records and the photos throughout are good. It's a yearly gift!
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander feels a major goal of his life's journey is to show scientific and medical proof of life after death.  As a qualified neurosurgeon, he is able to prove this to the skeptical medical community.<br />Great book for anyone!
B003H6KRIE|4.0|Has it all: handsome leading man, lots of action, love story, government intrigue...but most of all a satisfying ending to the trilogy. Watching all three in a row is fun. Enjoy comparing all three versions of Moby's &#34;Extreme Ways&#34; at the end of each flick.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game; it's given my kids and I hours of entertainment. I would most definitely recommend it.
B002M9WW30|4.0|What's not to love...It's Rocky, after all. We all know that none of the sequels have the sheer emotion, grit and joy of the original (though I think Rocky III stands up really well), but when you put them all together, you've got a pretty decent life story of a guy who had nothing, then had it ALL, then LOST it all - including his mentor, best friend, and the love of his life - but in the end, life just couldn't knock him down. Just gotta love the guy.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is one very useful app. When distant stations, especially on the am band, must reduce their wattage to comply with FCC regulations, this app replaces the computer as the only practical way to listen to these local stations.  This alone makes this deserving of the 5 star rating.  The buffering times are almost instantaneous, which is another plus.  Also, this app sounds much, much better on the Kindle Fire HD because of the improved speakers and Dolby sound.  Very satisfied with this product.
B0091REZMW|2.0|its alright freezes and slows down my kindle. moves really really slow and skips like a cd or movie. not even worth being free
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The main character gets involved with a secret society of scholars who protect the written word.  This book was  Interesting, quirky, and fast paced. I will definitely reread this book in my e-book collection.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I absolutely loved this book from beginning to end. The use of language and language skills to show progression is amazing. I would recommend this book to even the pickiest of reader. The main character is so easy to get to know and love, you feel so terrible for him at times and you want to cheer for him at other times. No other book will evoke this much emotion in you.
B000062V9C|1.0|wouldn't play because they sent the dvd to the wrong &#34;region&#34;.  didn't even know what that was but apparently dvds have certain regions they will work in to combat piracy or some bs
1939416019|5.0|It took me three days to read this book, my kindle came everywhere with me. The storyline just grabs you and makes' you part of their world. I am not a avid reader by any means, and I usually do not veer from James Patterson. I read the first couple of pages before I purchased the book and decided to move forward. It takes a lot for a book to enthrall me; obsessed is a better word!!!!!<br /> At the end of the book, you will be absolutely be looking for the next book. The main character takes you on this journey with him to learn this whole new world, that he himself has not seen.So you get a chance to grow and learn with the character<br /> Just a great story, Morgan Rice did an outstanding job and I very much look forward to the rest of this series
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Very eye opening book.  Amazing what she went through but it was hard to stay with at some points.  Got a little boring.
030758836X|4.0|I listened to this thriller in the car and kept finding excuses to waste gasoline and drive somewhere to get to the next incredible section.  I kept trying to figure out how this was all going to end.  That didn't work and when it did end I was not satisfied.  But the twists and turns of this harrowing story attest to the author's brilliance.  She is very, very good and I want to read more by her.  Is there more?
1609611543|4.0|This book has LOTS and LOTS of information. I found it so disturbing that I had to take in a little at a time! Off the &#34;Frankenwheat&#34; forever!
B0070XMYWC|5.0|I really liked the doll house.  It took sometime to put it together.  But my husband and I love doing projects like this.  We work really well together.<br /><br />The best part of it all was to see my Grand daughter who is 4 1/2 yrs. old face light up.  She was just talking about it this week how much she loves it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I read her other 2 books before this one and I liked them also but I couldn't hardly put this one down.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|2112 never sounded better or fuller. The 5.1 really brings it to life and I was totally blown away buy the comic book that plays along to the story behind the album and each song. Highly recommended for any Rush fan or audio snob.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Great story of life, and wisdom with age. Great story line, and some comedy rolled in. Enjoy fresh story. Thanks
B008R3EYZ4|5.0|Really captures the Magic and spirit of this wonderful band. A real treat as well when Blackmore whips out the strat especially on the new song!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this trilogy that I've reread the books twice back to back! I hope they make the movie! So in love with Christian and Ana, Oh my!
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I was disappointed in the way the book ended and it's not my favorite book by Nicholas Sparks, but it kept my attention.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing! The first two books were definitely page turnovers, captivating my attention until the last page· Can't wait to finish the trilogy!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the fact that I can access the Bible on the go and not always carry my actual Bible. While I love my real Bible for underlining passages and keeping personal notes, having this in my bag at all times makes it possible for me to read at work on a break or waiting at a docor's office for instance.  It has several versions which I also find helpful.  You can also access reading plans for devotions.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|Solid album by Kelly. It mixes a lot of genres in it: Alternative, Pop, Rock, Slow mid tempo songs. Very wide in musicality all over. Songs that stood out for me in the album are:<br />1)Standing In Front Of You<br />2)You Can't Win<br />3)Einstein<br />4)Dark Side<br />5)Mr.Know It All<br /><br />Very solid album by Kelly and great to see her back again with a strong album.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn again captures the excitement and thrill of fast paced black ops in the pursuit of terrorists. Almost like you're reading from today's headlines. Can't wait for the next installment of Mitch Rapp.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I would prefer Pogo's Mahjong games.  Their mahjong games are more interesting. I have to figure out the enlarging of the text for this game only.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I found this book to be spellbinding. It's out of the normal genre that I usually read but I had no problems falling right into this book. I recommend to anyone that appreciates a good love story.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|He is one of my favorite authors.  First, there is always spicy humor in his prose.  He makes his story settings seem real.  His female characters are mysterious and sexy without explicit sex. Finally, his endings are suspenseful and satisfying.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. I recommended it to our book club at school. It is the kind of story that moves your soul as well as your belly! I laughed and cried often.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|The story is pretty good. Clever, even. But the delivery of goods leaves something to be desired. There's a bit too much CGI for a story that only needed some special effects to make it scary. Instead, we get to see gravity-defying physics and very unrealistic blood. And why did directors start using the weird density filters in their movies? I just can't believe you need to make everything a blue/black color in high contrast to have a great horror movie.<br /><br />However, this movie does have some decent (not great) acting and wonderful action scenes. Nice, gothy overtones (a la Tim Burton) help the style of the movie a lot.<br /><br />Peace.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|This Christmas CD of Rod Stewart is purchased for a fan of his. I think she has all his music as he progressed from his origanal style to a much softer blend.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Its a very good way of keeping In touch with family and friends,  with people  whom you have lost touch with. I did not give it 5 stars because &#34;keeping in touch&#34; is sometimes carried to extremes. One doesn't really need to share everything.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Enjoyed the book but not quite as good as The Hunger Games,  can't wait yo read the conclusion of the trilogy.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my daughter loves to draw it keeps her busy and the price was right i love my kindle so many things you can do with it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|the charger came very quickly and worked well!...it fit nicely into the kindle and also worked well with my kindle hd
B00881VLCE|5.0|you get to pick out a picture and then it turns into a puzzle that you have to put together
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I'm not really a movie person but I really liked this movie. It had a little of everything in it. This is a movie that I would watch more than once. Good chick flik for sure.
B001EC2J20|3.0|No initial regrets... the movie played well... the cost was low... easy to purchase... I would do it again... I did want however, to go back and rewatch parts that I missed, but once the movie ended it would not let me go back.. VERY BUMMED about that.
