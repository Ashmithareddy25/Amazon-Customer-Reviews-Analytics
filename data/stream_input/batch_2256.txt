B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I need to commend Colleen Hoover on her writing here.<br />I wasn't a big fan of her style on the \\"Slammed series\\" but in \\"Hopeless\\" she got it right. The characters are well developed. There's no way you will not get involved with their story.<br /><br />Hopeless brings the perfect dose of laugh out loud moments and heartbreaking ones.<br /><br />So, why i'm not giving 5 glorious stars? It just preference. Towards the ending the story was too heavy for me and I wished for a \\"chapter break\\" but it never came. I wasn't a fan of how many times she made Sky and Holder re-lived their dark moments but I understand why she did.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|As a long-time Justin Hayward and Moody Blues fan, I have anxiously awaited new material from him.  His 1997 \\"The View From The Hill\\" was incredible, and the first 12 tracks of \\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\" are just as incredible.  The more I listen to them, the more I like them.  While I loved the \\"original\\" version of \\"Broken Dream,\\" this version is at least as good, and maybe just a touch better.  \\"One Day, Someday\\" is a great song and almost all of them are very good and get better the more you listen to them.  But my advice is to burn those first 12 songs onto your own CD and then break this one in half before you ever have to listen to the Disco-Techno-Drivel-Sonicrap of the last two songs.  Why someone with Justin's talents would include such disgusting waste of time on his wonderful new album is totally beyond me.  Do yourself a favor and don't even listen to them because they will make you dislike what is a really good album!  Without them, it's a 5 no doubt, with them, I am tempted to make it a 3 but you can always skip the junk at the end, so I compromised and made it a 4.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|This watch is great for its price. The automatic movement is great. It has shown good accuracy, can keep running overnight, and has lovely sweeping motion. The watch face is very classic, with just enough shine from the 5 logo.<br /><br />There are, however, some issues that explain why it's affordable:<br />- the strap isn't serious. But replacement straps are cheap.<br />- the calendar is sloooooow to turn. While the day dial advances quickly around 11pm, the day of week takes 4 - yes four - hours to turn! 2 to go to Spanish, another 2 to go to the right English day. This is a bit crazy. In fact the manual tells you to avoid adjusting your watch during those hours. My other automatics turn instantly.<br />- the watch knob has not heft. May sound silly, but adjusting the watch (done regularly since automatics are bound to stop) is not a satisfying experience.<br />- similarly the watch frame looks plasticky. It says steel, but it looks plastic. Also very light.<br />- the glass is not sapphire. Not a bit deal, but cheaper.<br /><br />I think this is an amazing watch for its price, and I love the look. In fact with a brown leather strap I've been wearing it daily. That said, it does not feel more expensive than it costs, either, so not a bargain in that sense.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|J.J. Abrams is a genius, & I wish they could have kept the show going for more than 5 seasons. I love watching the shows comercial free yeah!!!! It is tempting to want to see more than just one episode, but I pace myself so that I have the episodes to look forward to. If you have not seen the show, treat yourself, you will be glad you did!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I haven't purchased music in almost ten years, so I picked out a few popular albums to see if I liked any of the new music coming in. Of the albums I chose (including Fun's &#34;Some Nights&#34; and The Black Keys &#34;El Camino&#34; album), this one is probably my favorite.

When she returns as the master's wife, she has to reconcile her new role with her feelings that the only family she knew are now separate from her and are the property of her husband.  It is an intersting book..

0761171703|5.0|The photogragher produced enchanting pictures that captured seemingly impossible feats. They often left you wondering how on earth he got the picture.  In the last section of the book he explains how he got the picture.  I really enjoyed the book.
0192853619|3.0|The book is a short and very personal kind of tutorial. Its reasonably explanatory in a textual rather than a mathematical way. Nothing more than basic algebra is used and that too very occasionally. I found it fairly interesting and even amusing but no one is going to become a mathematician by reading it but then that was hardly the aim.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|Wait a minute; I thought the Ghost Rider could only appear in darkness and/or night?  If I'm not mistaken, didn't they make a great to-do about that in the first installment of this franchise?  In this film he comes and goes whenever he pleases or displeases, with a newly improved fiery skull puss.<br />As for the story, Ghost Rider takes a road trip to Europe.  Why?  Why not?  He soon runs afoul of mercenary gun running drug dealer Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth, the guy who used to be in CSI: Miami), and soon learns monks can be treacherous (Christopher Lambert in a bit-bit-bit part, face totally obscured by a lot of bad notices).  There's also a new demon on board (Ciaran Hinds) with a new name to go with his sour puss.<br />This time, the filmmakers try to dazzle us with a few tricks such as occasionally punctuating the story with cartoon interludes/explanations and a mess of split screens.  Nicolas Cage over uses his penchant for squirrely behavior in lieu of acting (funny faces and cat calls aside, were his shorts pinching him or what?).  Half of the RULES they set up to explain things they just as quickly ignored.  There's some prophecy mumbo jumbo, and we quickly learn that even though you tell everyone you have VAST power, you still have to employ inadequate henchmen to do your dirty deeds and resort to sedation instead of overpowering your subject with your vast reserve of POWER.<br />Although they threw everything in their kit and caboodle at the screen it still came off as just a lot of smoke and very little fire.  (Loved the not-so-snappy rejoinders: \\"road kill\\" and \\"go home!\\"  That's telling them Nicolas.  You sure put them in their place.  Next time, get a script.  Or better yet, send the skull and stay home.)
1455523003|5.0|I'm a late-comer to the Hitchens fan base, but this book is one of his best, in my opinion.  I had no idea of just exactly how Mother Teresa was as a person.  Like her or not, Hitchens tells it like it is, and lets you know a lot more about how the Catholic Church works.<br />A really informative book.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|I don't know if it hurt or helped that I knew nothing of this movie's comic book roots.  I had to take it as is, this bizarre supernatural antihero film.....with Nicolas Cage playing a contractual demonic bounty hunter named Ghost Rider.  Since he isn't dead, one wonders where the ghost aspect comes in.<br />For me, I couldn't get past the overlong opening that's dull as dirt while trying to introduce how the deal gone bad happened in the first place.  As much as I like Nicolas Cage, his character was only interesting when on fire.  Peter Fonda made a poor Mephistopheles, could he have talked any slower.  His carefully measured speech came across as the lazy way to achieve menace, which he never did.<br />The story is interesting enough but it takes forever to get to the ultimate showdown.  After watching it twice, I still don't feel the threat of a hell on earth was ever in doubt.<br /><br />Eh.  At most, it was watchable, only I won't be watching it again.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book was recommended by a friend and was on a best seller's list.  I had seen a portion of an interview with the author.  The subject matter is fascinating, but his arrogance is evident in the first pages.  He really thinks highly of himself.  I tried so hard to get into the book, I just couldn't stomach it past the first few chapters.  I'm disgusted with myself for having not looked at other reviews before making the purchase.

B009FZFONO|4.0|It goes without saying that The Walking Dead has redefined the Zombie genre. Season 3 of this show has not in any way been a let down. The examination of people put into desperate situations and how they deal with them has been nothing short of brilliant. Yes, we all like to see a Zombie get it in the coconut, however the interplay between characters, manipulation of facts, and revelation of truths is far more interesting. Season 3 has done all of these things and more. Looking forward to Season 4 with some trepidation. A Change in Producer and the primary writing staff has me wondering...what now?

1937909514|5.0|The former reviewer expressed my exact sentiment - you can't stop and give individual comments cos you just can't stop reading once you start with the first volume. My emotions were on a roller coaster ride during the whole read - from hating Jake to loving him and hating him and loving him, and, well, loving him (how can you not at the end?). So, a warning - don't start if you don't have the time to run through all five volumes in a short time. You won't be able to stop!

B0089LOKHG|3.0|My Review: In preparation for this book, I listened to Pandemonium again - mostly because I couldn't quite remember everything that happened, and I wanted to make sure that I got the full effect of the final book. The thing that stuck with me the first time and the next time I listened to the book was this; it's unfair! I didn't want there to be the battle of two boys and one girl. But of course that is what we get.<br /><br />So here we are. The final book of the Delirium series, and this book is about finally breaking free of the oppression of a government who wants to control everything about the lives of....well everyone. By suppressing feelings of love and hate, they feel that they can create a perfect, safe world, but as it is in any world scenario - there are always exceptions and people who do not want to follow the rules. And in this case, the rule breakers are right. To live without emotion is no way to live at all.<br /><br />Requiem focuses mostly on the battles to come, planning, plotting and achieving the goal of overturning a corrupt government. This is expected and desired of the third book - I have no complaints there. The thing that was missing a from the book was the relationship between the characters. I felt all interactions between characters was surface level at best. Most of the time conversations were glossed over. Sometimes, all of the dialogue that could have happened was summed up in a paragraph, something like, &#34;and for the remainder of the week we got to know each other.&#34; (Those were my words, not a direct quote, by the way.) This disappoints me because the best part about books for me is usually character interactions. It's what makes a great book in my opinion. And this particular book was flush full of opportunities for good dialogue.<br /><br />The entire book isn't that way, mind you - there are exceptions, like the first real dialogue between Lana and Alex. Lots of emotion there. But there was not much to be had between Julian and Lana, no matter how much we may or may not have fallen in love with Julian in the last book. Lana just sort of used him throughout this entire book, and was very patronizing toward him as well; I was actually looking forward to Julian giving her the what for because of that, but he never did. Lana was all consumed with thoughts of Alex almost the entire time, and continued to use Julian to keep her warm at night. If you're trying to figure things out, you really shouldn't take advantage of someone's emotions while you're doing it. Just my opinion.<br /><br />If I wasn't so focused on the Lana/Alex/Julian triangle, and the lack of....anything, I might have had the chance to really enjoy the addition of Hana's voice to the book, which in hindsight turned out to be the best parts of the book...but instead of savoring the offshoot of the story, I was too consumed with the passion that was lacking - which I found utterly ironic since it was suppose to be &#34;passion&#34; they were fighting for.lian and Lana, no matter how much we may or may not have fallen in love with Julian in the last book.

B00B0NDF26|4.0|I've heard of Tegan and Sara before, but honestly was not much of a fan of their music. Recently however, I listened to the clips of this album though, and was reminded of the 80s infused techno-pop of La Roux, The Veronicas and to a lesser extent Little Boots and have found a new uptempo workout album for myself. Like La Roux, the lyrics (while still not exactly Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen) also are not just cookie cutter dancehall refrains, you can tell the young ladies put their heart into them as they talk about relationships and love (the primary topics on the album) in mildly melancholic lyrics, backed by uptempo music.<br /><br />People interested in pop music, dance music, and LGBTQ themes will find lots to like here. It's not a seminal album, but it's a surprising amount of fun and just a really great pop album. The production is also absolutely amazing and the best mixing I've heard on a pop album like this.<br /><br />If this doesn't break a mainstream single, Tegan and Sara need to get a new marketing/promo team. This should be a platinum record.

0345404475|5.0|Warning *spoilers*<br /><br />Set in a post-apocalyptic world that is spiraling toward entropic decay, this distinctly neo-noir masterpiece of science fiction at once engenders both feelings of misanthropic despair and triumphant solidarity in our common humanity. As with most great sci-fi novels, it is a profound inquiry into the human condition, morality and religion. Unlike most other works in the genre however, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? offers a far more nuanced take on religion and faith, especially through the lens of human suffering and desperation. It follows the main protagonist, Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter with bitter insecurities and a bleak disposition, whose miserable, nihilistic existence is more than palpable. He is very hard to like, along with most of the supporting characters such as his perennially depressed wife Iran, and J.R. Isidore, a mentally-deficient driver for an electric animal repair shop that masquerades as an veterinary clinic. The plot and subplots that unfold eventually culminate in a revelation that transforms Deckard's psyche and worldview and in the process, unsettles the reader's own.<br /><br />After the World War Terminus (oh humanity, why do we like to self-destruct?), the nuclear fallout has rendered planet earth virtually uninhabitable, and the situation is getting worse day by day. As an incentive to encourage people to emigrate to the various colonies in space, the U.N promises each person an \\"andy\\" - an android servant to attend to his/her every need. The thick miasma of dust and radiation particles ensures that the sun no longer shines; as a result, animals are exceedingly rare and a good number of species have gone extinct. The humans who remain are clustered in various putrefied urban centers, their bodies and minds slowly wasting away from radiation poisoning. In the opening scene, a argument between Iran and Rick ensue about a device called the Penfield mood organ, which can artificially simulate any specific emotion. Despite having the choice of dialing in happy upbeat emotions, Iran deliberately elects to undergo depression twice a month. It is a paradoxical, almost sadistic choice, but eventually, the reader discovers that Iran merely desires to experience a pure human emotion. She needed a baseline, an emotional trough, to make the machine-induced states of happiness and bliss real enough. That emotions can be so easily manipulated by neural stimulation sounds like an idealistic pipe dream - who wouldn't want to be able to do what Rick did to end the altercation, when he dialed 594 for the emotion: pleased acknowledgment of husband's superior wisdom in all matters? After the disagreement is settled, Rick uses the mood organ to motivate himself to get to work to hunt for andys, a job that he's barely passionate for, though it is noted that he himself has an innate, intrinsic approach that circumvents the need for plugging into the Penfield.<br /><br />The humanoid androids, manufactured by soulless corporations back on earth, deplore the isolation and indentured servitude that they have to endure on the colonies and many wind up fleeing back to earth, blending in with and living among the remaining humans. A group of Nexus-6 brain model types (a production of the Rosen Association) that have been squatting in the San Franciscan Police Department's jurisdiction, are marked up as kill targets for the city-employed bounty hunters who receive a monetary reward for each one that is successfully retired. Problem is, their highly advanced cognitive abilities and organic human-like appearance make them very difficult to detect; indeed, the only way to know with certainty is to do a post-mortem bone marrow test. Cautionary tale about unfettered technological progression notwithstanding, this poignantly raises the question of what exactly sets humanity apart from the androids. For as long as the history of human civilization is concerned, we have been obsessed with defining ourselves in relation to the \\"Other.\\" (Exhibit A: the embarrassing attempts by Western anatomists and sociologists to lend academic credence to the justification of the colonial slave trade)<br /><br />In Philip K Dick's dystopian story, empathy turns out to be the defining attribute of humanity and as such, the Voigt-Kampff psychological test is deployed to sift out the androids from the humans. The Nexus-6 types however, come really close to mimicking empathic responses that are increasingly becoming undetectable by the test; the line in the sand is continually shifting, in what is becoming a heated arms race between increasingly sophisticated android technology and increasingly sensitive gap-detecting psychological tests. This doesn't seem all too foreign a concept in our web-driven lives - how many times have you encountered a test to prove that you were an actual person whenever you tried signing up for something online?  That's right, these days, the CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) have become so sophisticated that most of us have to squint really hard at the screen or take multiple tests just to get through to a website or make a comment on a forum or blog. Ask yourself, have you ever been slightly miffed, maybe even mildly insulted by the idea that you actually had to prove to the website administrator that you are in fact, not a robot? These types of situations will become more prevalent as we increasingly migrate aspects of our lives into the digital realm.<br /><br />Due to the scarcity of real live animals, owning one has become a coveted status symbol and those who can't afford the real thing resort to buying electric animals to keep up the pretense. Initially, as Deckard's self-worth was tied to the sad fact that his black-faced Suffolk ewe grazing outside his apartment was ersatz, his prime motivation for following the directive of his job was to use the bounty from each retired andy to purchase a real animal. At first glance, this appeared to be merely a critique of man's penchant for mindless consumerism but it is later revealed that unlike humans, andys are hopelessly incapable of caring for and keeping a real animal alive due to their lack of empathy and nurturing sensibilities. Rick's obsession with acquiring a real animal becomes more of a yearning borne out of a need to distinguish himself from the androids, as the line between \\"them\\" and \\"us\\" start to blur. In the midst of his deepening moral quandary, Deckard tries to take comfort by reinforcing his own humanity.<br /><br />One of his kill missions, which involved retiring an android (Luba Luft) who was posing as a singer with the San Francisco Opera, rattled Rick's conscience to its core, causing him to question the morality of his actions. Luba had lived on earth for years with a rather high profile as a famous opera singer and Rick, ever the classical music connoisseur, had a hard time coming to terms with why he had to exterminate a productive member of society who never once caused trouble. In fact, her sole existence on earth was devoted to generating beautiful, emotive, artful performances for the enjoyment and appreciation of all. This, juxtaposed with an encounter with a rather cold and callous bounty hunter in the form of Phil Resch forces the reader to ponder, just as Rick does: Is a human with low empathy worth more than an android capable of showing empathy and if so, why? Our incessant compulsions to throw around labels, along with the degree of arbitrariness to which we apply these labels are called into question. Bearing in mind that Philip K. Dick wrote this novel in the 1960's before research in primatology and animal behavioral science showed that humans do not have a monopoly on empathy, what does that mean in terms of our own relationship as a species to the rest of the animal kingdom? Indeed, scientists have observed and recorded empathic and compassionate behavior in primates, mice and even chickens.<br /><br />Dick discusses religion through a fictional prototype called Mercerism, based on the journey of its founder, Wilbur Mercer, whose arduous climb up a mountain is an exercise in eternal futility.

Devoid of empathy, the andys are unable to partake in the main ritual of Mercerism - achieving an altered state of shared consciousness - so they were eager to call out the fake origins of Mercerism, expecting that this revelation was going to change everything, that the humans would immediately abandon their adherence to the religion.<br /><br />Isidore, dejected and shaken after the disclosure, has a mystical out-of-body experience with Mercer himself. What follows is one of those most subtly profound, nuanced allegories of faith:<br /><br />\\"I am a fraud,\\" Mercer said. \\"They're sincere; their research is genuine. From their standpoint I am an elderly retired bit player named Al Jarry. All of it, their disclosure, is true. They interviewed me at my home, as they claim; I told them whatever they wanted to know, which was everything.\\"<br /><br />\\"Including about the whisky?\\"<br /><br />Mercer smiled. \\"It was true. They did a good job and from their standpoint Buster Friendly's disclosure was convincing. They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed. Because you're still here and I'm still here.\\" Mercer indicated with a sweep of his hand the barren, rising hillside, the familiar place. \\"I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you until you lose interest and want to quit. But you will have to stop searching for me because I will never stop searching for you.\\"<br /><br />As an atheist, I felt like I was wearing the shoes of the \\"androids\\" who just couldn't get why nothing changed at all despite the obvious demonstration of Mercerism's inauthenticity. I've wondered why is it that, despite the fact that scientific progress continues to chip away at the gaps of knowledge that have traditionally been attributed to the divine, a good proportion of people still prefer to believe in myths and conspiracies. Rick Deckard, who was portrayed as a more or less nonchalant follower of Mercerism in the beginning, has his own epiphany at the end of the book where he \\"fuses\\" with Mercer. It is this blurring between reality and faith that radically alters Rick's worldview, in a way that wouldn't have been possible before. He suddenly sees the moral Truth with great clarity, and is no longer consumed by the desire to acquire an animal for one-upmanship. The principles and values that stem from Mercerism are very much real, even though the religion itself is completely fabricated - as long as a person experiences it as real and is transformed, what does it matter whether it was merely a human construct, or in this case, a cheap Hollywood production?<br /><br />Mercerism is not just a spiritual need for the remaining earthlings in the most desperate of times, it's practically a survival mechanism.  In a world torn apart by man's selfishness and mindless chase of consumerism and technological solutionism, it is the manifests of Mercerism, the shared empathy and communal consciousness, that reinforce our common humanity and sustain the collective will of the species to survive. It is somewhat ironic however, that the real humans have to utilize machines like the empathy box and the Penfield mood organ to experience the very things that make us human - deep, pure emotion, and empathy. In a way, this mode of life dehumanizes them, and makes them barely distinguishable from androids who have had their psyche and memories implanted artificially. If we think about the mood-enhancing drugs on the market today (Prozac I'm looking at you) or even drugs that \\"help\\" us get motivated and focused (Adderall), and how the internet and social media have conspired to artificially engender mass empathy through clever videos and viral sharing, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? suddenly appears to be quite a prophetic tale.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|Those of You that listened and loved the music of the late sixties and pre-disco seventies will want this collection. Not as a nastalgia piece but as a vibrant reaffirmation of Joni's artistry.From Songs tp a Seagull to Mingus a journey both intensly personal, artistic, and I believe eternal. Her music is never sappy but always straight thru the heart. Many a joni fan rued her jazz albums Luckily for me I had had already developed a jazz ear by then and fell into the verve of Don Juan's reckless Daughter and Mingus (also a C. Mingus fan). This collection deserves a place on your bookshelf of great literature and music as well as in your head. Thanks Joni thanks from the &#34;aging children&#34; and me.

I mean just getting to think about titles of video games and different genre matches... it is like living a dream of being a game Dev and wondering which one of my hits the public will love.  I don't know how else to say it, but for the price, you will put so many hours into this, easily making it worth it.  This is a must buy.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never watch Zombie movies & didn't want to watch this when it came out because of the zombie theme. But then I started & got hooked - the story isn't so much about the walkers as about how the survivors behave afterwards.  I just wish the episodes were longer - time seems to speed up when I'm watching them!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|did not allow me to use app... failed login both attempts for guest and facebook... tried using it multiple times
B003P2WO5E|5.0|There's SO MUCH to say about this book... If I were to write everything I want to say about this work, I would spend days here. I will try and be short for once.<br /><br />First of all, I think I should mention I had NEVER read anything from Brandon Sanderson before, and I am quite sure I couldn't have found a better start. I first discovered who Brandon was when watching Geek and Sundry's \\"The Storyboard\\". I got into it because I'm a huge fan of Pat Rothfuss', but then a guy showed up. He looked a lot like myself, and he was just SO funny! I thought to myself \\"Why not?\\". Then I came to Amazon and saw \\"The Stormlight Archive\\" for about $3,00. \\"Wut? 1k pages for 3 bucks? I'm in!\\". Here in Brazil, a 1k pages book would cost around 40~70 dollars. Kelek provide Kindle a long existance. Thank you.<br /><br />So, the book starts with a guy. A guy named Kalak. He is standing before a huge thunderclast, which is a creature made of stone and fire. There are dead bodies everywhere. Kalak has died many times. Many, many times. But this time he has survived. He, and other eight have survived. Only one of the 10 died this time. This Desolation was bad, but they survived. And they were supposed to go back. Go back to a place of fire and pain. But... Why? What if he just... didn't go?<br /><br />Where are the others?, he asked the King of Heralds.<br />They are gone. The Oathpact is finished. If you're going, leave your Blade.<br /><br />And Kalak leaves his Blade. And he goes away.<br /><br />After an awesome prologue, the story jumps four thousand and five hundred years in the future, and we meet Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, who's about to kil a king. He wears white on the day he was to kill a king. And then we are  presented to the concept of Stormlight. And we learn about Lashings. And we learn about Shardblades and Shardplates. And we get mesmerized by how marvelously Sanderson's writing is. His prose is crystal clear. The way he WEAVES the story before oureyes, using concepts we have never encountered before to create something plausible, belieavable, is just astounding.<br /><br />Szeth is one of the most marvelous characters I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. BUT, he is by no means the \\"main\\" character of the book. In fact, he appears only sporadically.<br /><br />After Szeth, we meet Kaladin. If there is a main character in this work, it is Kaladin. The character is complex. In fact, the story is complex. It is so complex, actually, that I've had trouble going through the first chapters. Everything is so REAL, so DETAILED, that we find ourselves in a new world, meeting new people, and a new way of life. There are rockbuds and axelhounds and chulls and chasmfiends and fabrials and ardents and parshmen and Parshendi and Alethi and... Well, it's a whole new world, really. It is one of the MOST MAGNIFICENT worlds I have ever had the pleasure to \\"be in\\". But it's a hard read at first.<br /><br />It is not hard because it is bad. On the contrary: it is hard because it is so good. You need some patience to understand you are in a whole new world, with its own fauna and flora. We have skyeels! Kelek's breath, skyeels! The peoples are different. The animals are different. EVERYTHING is different. Even the weather.<br /><br />I've found some references to anime and manga, especially One Piece here. The climate is pretty much crazy, just like the Grand Line's climate is also crazy. Seasons come and go unexpectedly, and they last what? Months? Weeks? No one really knows.<br /><br />And then, there are the Highstorms. They come from the Almighty-knows-where, and they come because... Why do they come, after all? Who sends them, and why? Why do they always come from there? The direction we call stormward? Highstorms are so powerful, and so important, that they have shaped the world and its creatures and plants. But what are they? When did they start blowing? They must be linked to the Heralds... The Knights Radiant, maybe? The Voidbringers? So many questions, and so little time to answer them... Because the True Desolation approaches, and Odium reigns.<br /><br />Really, I can't detail the book too much, because it would take days. I've already made a chaos of my review, but that's because the book is SO good.<br /><br />The series is planned to have 10 books. I don't know if Mr. Sanderson is ever going to read this, but anyway: if those book are NEARLY as good as the first one, then you, sir, will have written the most beautiful and epic fantasy of all time. I don't think it is possible for something to be better than the first book, but I wouldn't be surprised if Brandon did it. He is a master, and that's for sure. I'm so glad I got to read his work. SO GLAD...<br /><br />Kelek provide you live long and prosper, Brandon. Thank you.

B007REV4YI|5.0|The long running James Bond series (50 years and counting) has faced a lot of challenges over the years including having to change cast and dealing with studio bankruptcy. But probably the single biggest challenge it has faced is the end of the cold war. For years it struggled to find a direction that made sense in the modern world, with varying levels of success.<br /><br />When the franchise rebooted with _Casino Royale_ they stripped things down to the bare bones with a more brutal Bond. While not universally popular the move was met with considerable acclaim. They also started to introduce a new organisation as an opponent for Bond. But with the critical failure of _Quantum of Solace_ that has fallen by the wayside.<br /><br />Instead what we get is perhaps the most personal Bond movie to date and quite probably the most personal we will ever have. Because there's material here you really can't call on a second time.<br /><br />The amazing Judi Dench as *M* gets a lot of attention this time round and deservedly so. Everything is personal in this movie. The relationship between M and Bond which has been central to the reboot is explored at length with Bond, perhaps feeling betrayed for the first time and realizing that he is just a piece on the board. We find out just a little bit about Bond's background too. About his parents and where he grew up. And even the villain is personal, at least for M.<br /><br />Of course since it is a Bond movie we also have some epic action set pieces. From the opening chase (which leads into a great Bond style credit sequence) to the explosion at Skyfall house there's no shortage of action.<br /><br />And there are new characters too with the introduction of Q, and Moneypenny. Both have been reinvented and modernized but at the same time they are at their core the characters they always were. Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory is worth watching throughout the movie to see how our understanding of the character changes, even though the character doesn't really change at all.<br /><br />And, perhaps playing into the fact it was the 50th anniversary there are a lot of very Bond moments going on throughout. We have a casino, we have a dead lover, a familiar car shows up. I didn't find any of these disrtacting though and perhaps most impressive at no point in the 2 hour and 30 minute running time was I bored.<br /><br />Easily one of the best Bond movies and I really wonder where they will go next with the franchise.e character doesn't really change at all.<br /><br />And, perhaps playing into the fact it was the 50th anniversary there are a lot of very Bond moments going on throughout.

B000GX8B9I|5.0|The movie does get off to a bit of a slow start, but it does provide a good setup of what is going on, what the background story is, and why they are there.<br /><br />The action and the bulk of the movie get going once the fighting begins. The United States soldiers were only supposed to be there for a little over 30 minutes, but became trapped overnight when heavier fighting than they expected breaks out and they are bogged down. This is the most intense and realistic war film I have seen. It isn't about being funny, it isn't about trying to portray glamour. It is about trying to show you what these soldiers went through in this conflict, and about what soldiers go through in the heart of battle. This is an extremely emotional movie, and one that reinforces how proud I was of our armed forces.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|For a book club challenge, I had to read a Man Booker Prize winner or nominee.  I thought I had already read all of the books that interested me.  I started and could not finish two others prior to starting this novel, so I wasn't terribly hopeful.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying this book!  I know very little about the Soviet Union in the 1950s, so I was immediately entranced with the vivid descriptions of Leo Demidov's life.<br /><br />Tom Rob Smith kept me guessing the whole time, which I really appreciate in a story.<br /><br />As soon as I finished Child 44, I immediately started in on The Secret Speech, book #2 in this trilogy.
B0060D2PFY|5.0|This movie is entertaining and thought provoking, it is amazing to see how much he goes through after deciding to become a whistle blower. He is faced with decisions on whether his cause for justice is truly worth what he is forcing himself and his family to go through, and it makes you think about what you would do in a similar situation. The movie is based on a true story, and it is an interesting introduction into how injustices change, and how difficult changes are and how much pioneers are forced to go through. As for the movie, it has twists and turns that are sure to keep you interested and has a very fast pace.

B006RXPUR2|5.0|The premise centers around a mother who is somewhat irresponsible, but desperate to find her little girl who has gone missing. Two private detectives are hired to supplement the police investigation, and the movie focuses on facts that don't end up making sense, and the difficulties of finding the little girl. The story moves along very fast, a number of interesting characters are examined, and throughout the movie, we are faced with moral dilemmas that the audience has to ask themselves what they think about certain decisions/what they would do in certain situations. It is a very entertaining and thought provoking movie.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|\\"One day\\" is a pure love story between 2 people. Their love grows in years and they go through very hard times, but still manage to make it work. Both main characters have an interesting personality, they are so different, but yet so similar. The movie is good as well, but book has many details that will give you the better view. Book is written very well and it gets your whole attention. I highly recommend it!

B001L5YW9I|5.0|A great movie with a story-line that has emotion, love, twists and turns, and a historical context. The movie really makes you think about what it was like to be in times like this, when everyday you had to worry for your life that something could go wrong in war/conflicts with others. The story moves along fast, and it makes you think that, today, it still goes on in many places around the globe. It is a very powerful movie from beginning to end.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book five is a fast read, but tends to spend too much time on certain characters.  Still a great book and looking forward to book six.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|This is an amazing movie with several great elements that come together to make a very powerful movie:<br />*Culture- It's a great look at the Indian culture. The cinematography is excellent, the costumes are so colorful and fun to look at, the daily difficulties of lifestyle for so many are examined, the sacrifices many make for others, etc.<br />*Discrimination- It wouldn't be fair to put this category in \\"culture\\", because it is a part of every culture, not just the Indian culture. But stereotypes are a big part of the movie, and we see how him the main character coming from a poor background influences how others think about him/treat him.<br />*Love- This is very much a love movie, the main character is motivated throughout by his love for a girl. He isn't sure she loves him, but he's sure he loves her, and any progress he makes in life is driven by his love for her.<br />*Suspense- I really became interested in the well being of the main character, so I wanted him to do well. He faces many difficulties and hardships, and I found myself rooting for him. There are twists and turns and throughout you are always on edge about how things are going to turn out.<br /><br />It is a great movie that has a lively story that moves along fast, has excellent cinematography, and has a fun/lively soundtrack with cultural dancing involved.
B005UBNKWO|3.0|I feel like i wasted $110.00 on this. It works fine but an AMD tri-core processor would have done just as well by me. This is actually slower for some of the programs i use on a computer. I will always be an AMD fan, but i feel they let me and others down with this processor. Spend less and get a usable tri core or quad core AMD (save yourself about $50.00)
B001UG56ES|5.0|The movie combines an interesting story-line, excellent cinematography, and an interesting perspective on aboriginal history. The movie centers around a wealthy woman who inherits running her husband farms after he is killed in the outback. She meets an aboriginal man, who meets aboriginal children whose parents have been taken by the government and makes them her own. Along the way she faces challenges of both the system and the wilderness and it is compelling to watch. The cinematography of Australia is excellent with overhead views and stunning video of rivers, rock canyons, and land-forms. The story goes by fast and is very interesting from beginning to end.
B000UEA5EW|5.0|This book continues to set the standard for personal accounts concerning the United States Marine Corp in World War II.  My only regret is that I never had the chance to meet Mr. Sledge and thank him personally for his service.  I could not put this book down from the first few pages to the very end!  The details are graphic and emotional, and gives the reader a true picture of the horrors of war!  This should be a must read for every high school student in America!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|While there were a few unpleasant surprises in this movie, I thought it was awesome in the sense that it is like having a front row seat in a train wreck without being directly involved, and seeing what happens before and afterward.<br /><br />I prefer to learn from other people's mistakes, and dude, some of this movie felt real. Just looking at it made me grateful that I am only addicted to computers, movies and reading books.<br /><br />There was one point where Denzel and John Goodman were doing a sort of cowboy swagger down a hallway, and it reminded me of that scene in Malcolm X where Denzel and Spike Lee, I think it was, were striding down the street in their zoot suits.<br /><br />After making a movie like this, Denzel has carte blanche from me, even if one of his future movies winds up like Fallen, where he doesn't win and it's never over. I didn't like that one at all. I even watched Fallen twice to make sure I was giving it a fair shake.<br /><br />Fallen aside, I wonder why he doesn't make even more movies than I've seen him in. (Oh wait. Maybe he has.) After an IMDB check of their movies with actor creds, Denzel Washington, 53; Bruce Willis, 94; Tom Cruise, 40 (really? wow.); and another favorite actor of mine, just for kicks, Don Cheadle, 74. That's an eye opener. I had no idea Don Cheadle had that many. He's in \\"Flight\\" as well. Something to look forward to.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I own almost all of the Mavel movies and this is by far the best, can't wait for the next one. Also this was my first blu-ray movie and was great on my new blu-ray player.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|truly inspiring. i'm so glad that the story of franz and charlie was discovered and that it can be shared with the world.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I'm so glad i bought this cable, it is a must have if you use a otg cable. the only gripe i have and it is a very small one is they should label the side that charges.lastly it was shipped very fast and had it in less than 5 days

B00846F1YW|3.0|I am not a real BIG fan of Hidden Object games as I more prefer along the lines of RPG's and other types of action and or adventure games.<br />But at times I like a small change of pace and so I'll play Hidden Object Games for awhile.<br />And this one is fun while at the sametime a bit aggravating to me.<br />the main thing that bothers me is the way they tell you what objects you are looking for.<br />Instead of telling you what the objects are called that you are looking for, which alot of times that really doesn't make it any eaiser.<br />But instead here they give you a very encrypted and or vague white outline type of a picture of what you arelooking for and 90% of the time they can look like alot of things that are on the picture itself.<br />And that is what makes it so hard to tell what you are looking for.<br />If you like something different in the way things are done/played then thiis game may be for you.<br />But if you tend to get a bit aggravated when looking for something that youuureally don't understand then you might want to look at another Hidden object game.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Its ok game have to many freezes but get pass that it's ok other then that no other problem I have experience
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple Run 2 I feel is better then the first one the game play is faster and more responding to the player.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This from TV3 News in New Zealand<br /><br />\\"Movie star Ben Affleck's latest role in a film about the Iranian hostage crisis paints an untrue picture of New Zealand history.<br /><br />Argo  documents the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis where six US embassy staff were smuggled out of Tehran disguised as a film crew.<br /><br />New Zealand's ambassador in Iran at the time, Chris Beeby, and second secretary Richard Sewell secretly helped the staff escape by providing food and entertainment as they sheltered at the Canadian embassy. They also provided a safe house.<br /><br />However, the film depicts New Zealand as turning away the US diplomats, something which has troubled Affleck.<br /><br />\\"I struggled with this long and hard because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair,\\" he told Time Out.<br /><br />The film also says the British embassy turned away the US when in fact they were initially sheltered there before being moved to the Canadian embassy.<br /><br />The hostage crisis began in November 1979 after a group of militants and students took over the US embassy, holding 52 Americans hostage for more than a year.<br /><br />Failed negotiations and a failed rescue mission ensued the following year before a deal was reached in January 1981 and the hostages were released.<br /><br />However, six US diplomats evaded the crisis and were smuggled out to the Canadian embassy, given Canadian passports and flown to Switzerland.<br /><br />Mr Beeby and Mr Sewell played an important role in getting the diplomats to Switzerland.<br /><br />Mr Sewell drove the group to the airport to catch the plane to get them out of Iran.<br /><br />Mr Beeby also rented a property which could serve as a safe house if the US diplomats were discovered at the Canadian embassy.<br /><br />The actions of the Kiwi diplomats are chronicled in a book by Robert Wright about the ordeal called Our Man In Tehran.<br /><br />New Zealand's role was kept quiet because Iran wasthe biggest market for lamb exports at the time.\\"
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My husband found this app and he thought it was good so he showed it to me. I had to have it too. It is very useful and easy to figure out. I would recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy read, keeps your interest which is difficult for me as I am very easily distracted. The first night I bought it I read eight chapters, it is that interesting. You want to know what is going to happen next!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is obviously the best in the bloons series. The sun God is awesome and the the super monkey fan club it is awesome! This is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Only wish was that it would happen to all us girls. It is a cute story.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best bond movies ever, this bond has taken MI 5 into the 21at century. It also obviously shows that our OO7 spies never last for ever. Overall I give this movie 5 stars
1400064287|5.0|The brothers Heath have pulled the rug out from under conventional marketing. Rather than an outline for making our ideas more memorable, \\"Made to Stick\\" brings to life the six principles of sticky ideas, the ones that people get stuck to. Keeping your ideas \\"simple\\", \\"unexpected\\", \\"concrete\\", \\"credible\\", \\"emotional\\", and presenting them in the guise of a \\"story\\" are all essential elements to turning our ideas from hand-outs to Velcro. Whether a marketer, a teacher, a presenter, or someone who is fascinated by ideas and what makes some of them great, \\"Made to Stick\\" is recommended for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have just discovered Downton Abbey recently and I was instantly hooked!!! Too bad I have to wait till next year for season 4!!!!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I bought this movie for my four year old son. He loves it. Dr. Seuss' stories are always excellent and my son enjoys watching his favorite characters come to life on the TV screen.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Watching this ten year old season 3 in 2013, the acting is good, and the stage settings and special effects are not too dated viewed in HD.  Streaming quality from amazon is usually very good as received by my 2011 Sony tv via a Roku 2 XS.  I've been working my way thru seasons one and two and not all episodes are great, but that's been my experience with the Star Trek television franchise over the years, always a few 'stinkers' in every season but overall enjoyable entertainment.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Cassandra Clare builds a beautiful world where demons, angels, shadow hunters, vampires, warlocks, and werewolves all exist. However, they all exist without human knowledge. Much like the world of Harry Potter, the world of the shadow hunters is intertwined with the human world. The world is always there, but not for everyone to see. Step into another world and see the beauty and horror that lie just beneath the surface.
037571457X|5.0|This book has inspired me to read again and enjoy the comic narrative it follows.  This book is for my college class even though it is also used at high school level. Very engaging and simple to follow. Great source as a complimentary reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book before Hollywood made it a movie. In fact, I loved this book long before it became popular. I couldn't put The Hunger Games down and, after finishing it, I couldn't stop talking about it. I recommended this book to EVERYONE I saw and I still recommend it today.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have just finished reading this book and all I can say is, wow...  In the hell of war when Germany was near death throe, there was German pilot still holding on to his sanity enough to let go badly damaged B17 bomber with dead and injured crew only because...the bomber was helpless.  Had this been any other German pilot than Franz Stigler, the odd would have been obvious; the bomber would be shot down just like that.<br /><br />Think about it.  1) At the time, German pilot risked execution if it was found out that he spared the life of opposing pilot.  2)  German pilot earned 3 \\"points\\" for bomber shot down.  Fighter earned only 1 \\"point.\\"  3)  Had Stigler shot down this bomber, he would have earned easy three points and he would have also won coveted Knights Cross award.<br /><br />Any other ordinary German pilots would have succumbed to easy temptation but Stigler didn't.  He considered shooting down helpless bomber as murder even though the bomber piloted by Charlie Brown had bombed Bremen earlier.<br /><br />I only found out about this book by accident when I was perusing CNN website.  Under title, \\"Two enemies discover a 'higher call' in battle\\", written by John Blake, was story about an act of mercy that when I finished reading, I was amazed.  I quickly checked Amazon and found the book in question, read the sample section and promptly placed order via Kindle.<br /><br />I felt the author of this book did excellent job of tying in the story about the two pilots background prior to World War II, during the war and after.  The opening page quickly grabbed my attention, kept it and with difficulty I had to stop reading because it was late at night and I had to go to work.<br /><br />If you are World War II history buff then I can heartily recommend this book as worthy addition to your collection.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I'm a huge fan and I absolutely love having their music in the palm of my hands. Great album, but then again, maybe I'm partial. I have been a fan since Songs About Jane.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Loved the show, but can not stand the Theme music, they can do better, and I sure hope they do
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I am absolutely in LOVE with this series. Maybe I shouldn't be. The story is, after all, about being cured from, dare I say it?, love. Excellent series. Strong characters. A must read.
B007HLIUN4|5.0|Finally a book that explains most of the reasons why some nations have made it into the 21 st century and others are lagging. It is not religion as examples abound of rich Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus etc...It is not geography, not anymore. Africa is finally living to its potential and beacons of light exist to lead the rest. I love Jared Diamond, read his books and watched the documentaries but his point of view is over simplistic, too much based on observations of prehistorical societies. The emergence of agriculture and domesticated animals is certainly far off the mark to justify the differences between Canada and Mexico, or England leaping over France during the Industrial Revolution.<br />This book shows many failings: little hard data, graphics or numbers to illustrate the author's arguments. No historical trends either. It is a good idea to buy the kindle version so the reader can wander in search of corroborative evidence because the book doesn't offer much.  The author also chose to move from one topic to another without so much as a connection or strategy, and this is not the best way to convince those who are in awe of China and disregard democracies' greatest strength: in the long run, it is the only way forward to promote prosperity and exert power in a meaningful way. Humans are too competitive and dictators are bound to be toppled eventually either peacefully, in a bloody civil war or displacement by more assertive competitors.<br />Still I give the book great marks for the clarity of the arguments and this hopeful message in favor of democracy.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! Glad I was able to have  great friends recommendation. The whole bad boy loving the innocent girl,cute!!
B008EKOO46|3.0|I'm a fan of Jared Diamond although I disagree often with his conclusions, which I find over simplistic, especially explaining the prosperity of modern nations based on prehistorical explanations. Nonetheless his books are highly entertaining and the documentaries he stars in are riveting. This book is certainly not his best.<br />This book is too personal, and Mr Diamond makes sweeping conclusions based on a very small sample of primitive societies which he once studied. His observations are anecdotal and shouldn't be construed as arguments leading to actions and policies. He is also too myopic in his judgements of modern society and fails to look beyond the USA. In France and Spain for example, grandparents are still making a meaningful contribution to the well being of their grandchildren by babysitting them while the parents work. Old people might enjoy the independence retirement plans give them over living with their sons for their welfare, especially if the sons disappear in needless warfare as is the case in some of the tribes Mr Diamond describes. The heavy costs to society and individuals of privileging the traditional ways are not discussed in depth, if at all. There must be good reasons for modern societies to ditch most of the traditions and social mores Jared Diamond describes, and it would be more useful to look into this instead of longing for bygone eras.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Was surprised to hear they made another alien video. Didn't know until watching but oh so glad they did.<br />Wonderful movie, enjoyed it immensley. But then I always did like the Alien series.<br />Will be watching many times over along with the rest of the series.<br />Beautiful job, would recommend to any one, especially if they like sci-fi.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it every day. The abil ity to store sev eral cities is great. I wou ld reco mend it
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I like this game because it is just the best game I ever played and I give this a 5 star
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very good like temple run except without the very annoying turns. It's free only pay if you want to level up to get to the top of the leaderboards.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Took a little time to get into it, but midway it turned around and ended up being a real page turner....
B005Q1W10A|5.0|same comments as I made about Season 1 DVD. DVD arrived promptly. I am now ready for Season 3 to be entirely up to date before Season 4 begins!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie in the theater and really liked it.  The  product was shipped fast and we had no problems with the disc.
B000VYVH3Y|4.0|I read this book really fast because the thought of this not being curtailed freaked me out. They are using similar procedures now believe it or not.  This is a great, fast, disturbing read.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Read this and i legit felt happier. It's not like a preachy self help book. It's Ellen telling you in her own words how she stays so positive and happy. It's hysterical from start to finish, and if you watch Ellen on the regular you can hear everything in hey voice perfectly. Wonderful
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|I think one book... one movie is how it should be, this movie left off just where the book gets started.  Big disappointment.
B000QCSA54|5.0|Exceptional book! It helps you focus on what you need to achieve rather than everything. Better to focus on what works than not!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|its fun and exiting. beat the clock and get as far as you can.And get some coins.<br /><br />fun and amazing

B009FZFONO|5.0|Lets hear it  for the Judge..He brings some badly needed menace to the show.  Much less of the whispered conversations about their feelings/relationships between the men ..thankfully
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story about a sweet man finding himself is also very sad when the reader finds where he has been and what he has suffered. The author portrays the difference between his childhood and his manhood beautifully.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to just about anyone. The quality online was great and it was nice to see again.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was the most interesting and amazing book.  I was total mesmerized by what has been accomplished in medicine using the HeLa cells while at the same time I was so unhappy with the communication and care for her family.  I would totally recommend this book to anyone!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|We love  it and our kids do to. Wish you could ear the jellyfish and red fish but other then that it's so fun.
B008Q1T1IW|3.0|I absolutely loved the movie! Don't miss it!! And the soundtrack on the movie was wonderful, with the variation of Earth Wind and Fire, the latin-type sounds and the classical. However, this album didn't  have the classical mix that the chamber orchestra played for Driss, and I was looking forward to that. I did like what I got, especially the Wind theme. But I thought there would be more.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this film. I wanted to go back and see it again the next day. It was so pure, beautiful and up lifting. Definely on par with Message in a Bottle and The Notebook!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is s fun and addictive game working toward a great  accomplishment.  Graphics are great on Kindle Fire HD.  It does drain battery life quickly so keep an eye on that.  Can't wait for next one!!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I am a big fan of Walking Dead. However, the second have of season 3 has stalled out for me. Hearshshall is less mobile with one leg, they appear stuck at a prison with limited supplies, and Rick now has hallucinations.<br />I would like to see Rick and the Govenor to fight it out and then move on already.... Hope the writers for the series can help us out soon before this series starts to loose momentum.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome.  I love it. Its so fun to play when you just wanna get the anger out of you. All you have to do is click subway suffers in your apps and your ready to go. I also love how every once in a while they change the theme. To example acouple weeks ago they had Rio another time they had tourbof new houri. Well this game is so awesome and I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever. I don't know what I would do without it. Subway surfers is my life.  I have played subway surfers for every place like New York,Rio,Rome. I can't wait for the next one of subway surfers. I lllllloooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee subway surfers.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This game is olay for a free game. I am terrified to buy a paid game because I might waste my money. It's happened before. I've played a game or two on it and I like the sound when pieces are moved because I'm not good at staying focused. Since I'm just getting back into this I have to relearn keeping two plays ahead so the only thing I really don't like is, unlike the chess game on my computer, this games doesn't show the possible moves I can make with the piece I have my finge on at the moment. When you're learning, that can be a major help. other than that, I like the game.
0783240287|5.0|My son was in a production of this musical so I wanted this. I grew up with and love Andrew Lloyd Weber compositions. I was never a big Donny fan growing up (we are probably the same age) but I thought he did a great job as Joseph. My favorite part is when Benjamin steals the cup, and my son ended up playing him in the play.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|The movie was cute enough.  Humor was little above young childrens' heads. Entertaining and held our attention. Was a good way to kill an otherwise dull night.
B003VS0CXI|5.0|We used to get so excited when this movie would air on tv back when I was a kid. I bought it for my son when he was only two, and he/we watched it over and over and over....and it is over 2 hours long! I finally had to tell him I had other things to do, so he started asking everybody that came to our house if they would watch it with him. He is now 25 and I bought him this version when I saw it so he can show it to his kids someday. He loves cars to this day. Wonder if this is what got it started?
B00B2064IY|5.0|I love me some Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi Jimi JImi Jimi Jimi Jimi enough said
B001NEXEEG|5.0|I'm pretty much undecided which is the greatest all-time Western - \\"The Searchers\\" or \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" - but both transcend the genre and make an indelible mark on the viewer. And both feature Wayne who, perhaps, has never gotten his proper due as an actor.
B000093BDX|5.0|How can you go wrong with the Beach Boys?  Used the music for my brother's funeral wake- everyone loved it.
0802473156|5.0|I don't think there is a married couple that couldn't benefit from this book.<br />It becomes apparent early on that what we think our partner may want, to feel loved, could be entirely different from what they<br />really want.  A quick example is your husband brings you flowers every Friday when in reality all you want is his attention, or help around the house.  You may think he wants more pleasure in the bedroom when in fact all he wants is to hear you appreciate him and how hard he works.  It was a quick and easy read with good examples.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like temple run 2 better than every game  because it is so adventerest and exiting magical I recamand this to people who like adventerest things
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it. it is way more interesting than the first temple run. if you like temple run 2 then you should try subway surf.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my mother. She had seen a few of the shows after hearing about it from my wife and I. She is now a big fan of the show and loves this BluRay set. She also likes the included extras in the limited edition. It has a video about the area where the show is filmed and the family who now manages the estate.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great Game! The graphics are amazing and so is the gameplay.  Rivals any portable game sold but without the high costs.
0979019710|2.0|I don't like the &#34;selling&#34; that morning is the only way to be successful.  Trends are interesting and statistically speaking fun to play with BUT NOT the ONLY way to be successful.<br /><br />This reminds me of the old &#34;Amyway&#34; way to sell and how a sales team or management and pathetic attempt to brainwash people into doing it &#34;their way&#34;.<br /><br />It's not a bad book but it's for beginners and a sales manager wanting to &#34;establish&#34; their sales staff it's not bad but not good for anyone wanting to learn good habits or bad habits.  This book assumes mornings are the best of habits.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It actually works on my kindle fire hd! You just need to be patient.It's a great bargain too. You will not regret it. The graphics are the BEST! So hurry up and buy it!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book is not as good as the first 2 in the season. It seems as though the author ran out of things to write about and the plot because kind of strange.
B0088O11NU|5.0|this game is really fun and cool, but it is too easy, I finished the whole game in a half hour. would recommend, but not if you want it to last a little while. good game otherwise!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I thought that since this book was award-winning and had such great reviews, it would be unique and interesting. I finished it within a day and it was just too simple for an adult. I think it's geared toward tweens or maybe young adults.
B008D36INE|1.0|Awful.  This movie has awful.  Don't waste your time.  Cleaning your bathroom with a toothbrush would be more productive.  This movie has nothing to offer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER! It was so deep and meaningful. It was the best book I have ever read, by far.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love Love Love!!ll in 3 days. Everyone should have them!! I can't wait till season 3 comes out next year.
B00992CF6W|5.0|l really what it but it cost to much I haveit on my ipod so I know what it's about. Anyone have some money for me please.
0802473156|5.0|This book really does provide what it promises, which is a greater understanding of how to love your partner in a way that he feels your love. We often love another in ways we feel loved. We have an opportunity to see our relationships the way our partner, friend or other's in our lives feels loved.
B009AP2G26|5.0|This show is one of the best out there(opinion) although i can download it on my laptop for free, its nice to have it be portable, love glee!!
B008ZEP2KG|5.0|This movie is good but can be a little confusing at times if you haven't read the books, which I high recommend doing!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game isn't what i expected it to be. U don't get to free roam. It's just levels or stages but still nice
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|I bought The Hobbit for $14 which was available in HD and I was excited to watch. I decided to Purchase it from Amazon and not Xbox video because I did not have the room on my Xbox. This is the first time I have had a problem with Amazon Video, and most of the time I rent but I didn't want to wait for the rental. Unfortunately the video quality was poor, and it kept lagging, and I did not want to watch 3hrs of movie like this so I am out $14.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is an awesome app and it's almost like temple run I think it should be called temple o' fun
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love this app its free and its alot of fun i wish there wasnt thoughs stupid adds,  over all its a nice game to play to pass time warning its also addictive
B00722ZHG6|5.0|Birdy is a teenage girl from England who apparently is classically trained in music.  She seamlessly integrates this background to &#34;cover&#34; songs by other artists with a style that is right for popular genre of music.  So while the training comes though, it is not shown off - it doesn't dominate the titles she plays.  There are other a few other popular artists out there whose playing skills reflect that type of training but the music they do doesn't.  (Frank Zappa and Steely Dan, while not classically trained had styles of music akin to jazz that came through in their music without dominating it.  This set them apart  from the Rock 'n Roll/ Folk Music /Soul genre type artists of that error.)  A piano player herself, Birdy has come out with one of the more refreshing new sounds I have heard in 60 years of listening to  popular music. She crosses over the classical musical instrument sounds (not the classical sound of music)  without being a &#34;crossover&#34; artist.  She sings well and I think that her style, singing and instrumental, will have staying power over the years.  Having said all that, it appears she is more relatively more popular in Europe than in the Untied States; but so what.  This is an album you can listen to over and over again without getting tired of it.  I hope to hear more from her in the future.  For some good listening either as a stand alone CD or with the songs ripped into a larger play list of tunes,  you can't go wrong with this album.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|I've been a Cirque Du Soleil fan for 10 years and own many of the performances on DVD. This movie was (obviously) filmed different than the previous ones, but it definitely had some awesome performances and shocking stunts, along with a very visually interesting stage setup. This makes me want to go see KA live in Las Vegas.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I haven't read the Bible as I have never have taken the time.  My wife told me about this version for my iPhone.  I got the one where a narrator reads it to you, and if you want, you can read along with the text.  The narrator is different based on the version.  The KJV has an English accent.  The ESV has an American, no accent narrator.  The YouVersion has different reading plans that you can select.  I choose the Gospels in 30-Days that has a daily reading of about 15-minutes.  After listening to and following along with reading I have found I really enjoy &#34;reading&#34; the Bible.
B008QDCZJ2|5.0|If your a fan of the PSB, you need this compilation or you are not a true fan the the pop duo.
B00BNYCFNM|5.0|Wow! I must admit, I did not jump aboard the Big, Big Train until just recently, when I bought English Electric, Part One. At this same time, I also purchased another CD by a group that was also new to me, the latest cd by a band called &#34; the Mystery&#34;. At first, both cd's kinda pissed me off- how could bands with such great musicianship be content with making music that to me was merely an attempt to re- create the glory days of prog- rock, instead of forging out on their own to make new music. To me, &#34;The Mystery&#34; try to mimic Yes, and Big, Big Train mimic Genesis. I really couldn't shake that thought, so while I still really can't get into &#34;The Mystery&#34;, English Electric, Part One, started to grow on me, as some of the songs really started to get stuck in my ear.<br />But English Electric, Part One, did not prepair me for this next offering, Part Two. From the moment I heard it, I was shocked. Although the echo's of Genesis are still appearent, this is one of the only new progressive bands that I believe has broken through the traditions of old to create truely new music that stands on its own merit. The individual playing is unbelievable, its as if the keyboard player and guitar player are just trying to out duel each other with who can come up with the most new melodies and ideas, and the rhythm sections caliber of playing is just badass. But the vocals, harmonies, and song writing and structure are what I believe is propelling this band forward with the NEW. Lots of English Electric, Part Two, doesn't sound like anyone else but Big, Big Train, and its cool.<br />Maybe its just from playing togeather for awhile that has caused this band to jell like this, but whatever it is, I hope they continue on, for our prog loving selfs sake.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|Very entertaining and funny movie! My kids love Amanda Bynes! They really enjoyed this movie, and ask for us to buy this movie to add to their collection.

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The reason for the average rating is I'm having problems with my Amazon Instant Videos and was advised to up date my Adobe System but it still doesn't work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my favorite series!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this to everyone!!!! May the Odds be Ever in Your Favor. (:
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I was suprised that this album actually rocked. That being said, it is kinda of sad that it's only half of kiss that  partook in this project.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is great I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and its a great book I love it
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I just downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HD and I am having a blast playing this game!  The graphics are fantastic and it's so much fun to play. I recommend for kids and adults. Enjoy!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This is an adequate continuation of the Austin classic. After reading this from the great PD James, I realized its best to let go of Darcy et al as Austin intended.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Loved this movie. My husband and I appreciated the throwback game characters and my 5 yr old thought it was hysterical.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very good orbiting story. Good mixture of fantasy and intrigue. Kept me intrigued and very interested the whole way through.
B001JIAK66|5.0|For starters, Van Helsing is marvelously entertaining as an action-adventure-fantasy-werewolf/vampire movie. And the special effects and graphics are over-the-top and never stop -- even to the graphics used in rolling of credits.<br /><br />However, what really sets this movie apart from most of its genera is the character development, which has provided practical real-world insights into the mindsets of narcissists and criminal psychopaths. The use of contemporary American/English dialect (i.e., not \\"archaic\\") presented in a fantasy milieu has made the villains more comprehensible to those who might be initially upset by the chilling \\"reality\\" of real-world villains (such as contemporary serial killers, fraudsters, and similar \\"parasites\\" and \\"vampires\\").<br /><br />In addition to its value as entertainment, the movie also serves as a valuable teaching tool for those studying abnormal psychology, and provides several good character studies for those whose careers involve working with society's most evil (made more palatable in the movie as mythical beings, but symbolic of villains who are far too real).<br /><br />Worth watching several times.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Very good and accurate timing so far after having it for 3 weeks.<br />I like its designed and price<br />I would recommend to one who are looking for an automatic watch with a reasonable price
B005H9B44A|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie; looking forward to watching more Prime movies.<br />The free movies are convincing me to stick with Amazon Prime; the need more movies.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Awful. No silver lining here. Save your money. Can not believe it is a best seller. The book is as crazy as Pat.
B000FBJF78|5.0|Brilliant in concept and execution. A basic human approach in the telling. An expanding joy with every page. Hard to put down after starting.
B007XH6BPG|4.0|One can wonder of this oldies (but goodies) really can have something left of inspiration after all songs made during nearly 50 years. But, surprisingly, this record is really good. But more pop for mature soft rock lovers than really genuine prog rock. But all in all much better than the most out nowadays from all this really insignificant and pretty dull neo- and new prog groups popping up all the time.
B008V4H6N6|5.0|One of my favorite albums to drive to. The futuristic jazz mixed with sexy trip hop makes this an album to not only bang to, but bang in space.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg addresses a number of very key -- and unfortunately continuing -- obstacles (external and internal) that women who aspire to leadership positions face. While I believe Sandberg's message can appeal to men and women across the professional spectrum, I think it's important to focus on the sub title:  Women, Work and The Will To Lead. In this book, Sheryl Sandberg does not degrade women who choose to stay home with children as a career, or take long breaks in their career, or who have no real desire to climb the ladder to the C-Suite. She does not degrade men. And she does not dodge the fact that she and her husband have the (well earned) means to hire the resources they need for household help and childcare.  What she does do is ask her female readers to challenge those internal obstacles and patterns that often hold very capable women back from the leadership roles they want and are qualified for.  She challenges men and women to question some long-held, but in many cases outdated, assumptions about both genders that end up holding everyone back. I admire her sharing stories of personal and sometimes painful episodes in her own life and career to underscore her points.  Extensive research was done to back up all of her positions.  The book is enjoyable to read, and, if you allow it, will challenge your attitudes and assumptions about many things, most importantly, about yourself and how much you hold yourself back -- or choose to lean in.
B0046MBZO8|5.0|I have always loved Ken Follett's novels.  His stories are wide in scope, yet very readable.  I am now reading the second in this trilogy!
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|I would give it a zero, if it were possible. I don't even know why it appeared on my kindle.
0375831002|4.0|This is a poignant book about the indignities the Jewish people suffered during the second world war.  To those of us who were too young to know much about the Nazi regime, this is an eye opener.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Once again she has written a book that touches the soul.  The way she developed the characters and made them jump off the page and become real is a wonderful talent.  I cared about the characters, and felt deeply for them.  I hated to put the book down.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I really loved it. That movie was never one of my favorites because of Sir Mr.<br /><br />I though he was too old for that part.<br /><br />Marilyn was awesome.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|peter jackson does another great job on this awesome adventure!Cant wait to see the next two! the cast was very good the graphics and the story line all where written and done well.
B00136JT3Y|4.0|I downloaded this digital version of Pink IND for my wife to enjoy the upbeat sound anywhere! Can't beat it for $2.99.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I played this on my kindle fire. it really does take a while to download but so much fun- it took a couple days and there are some great mini games along the way as well as HO. beautiful graphics...another winner from G5
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Interesting storyline, romantic and funny.  Starts out slow, but builds on history of characters. A good read, short and sweet.
1476733953|5.0|My husband mentioned hearing about a book called \\"Wool\\", which was very popular as an e-book, and was science fiction. Might have been on NPR, or in the Wall St. Journal. He wasn't sure, but I had just finished \\"Dearie\\", a superb biography of Julia Child, and was without a book and desperate for an excellent consumingly good one, since I had just come off a fabulous 'read'. Praying that it would be dystopian fiction rather than just science fiction, I snuck my daughter's Kindle out of her room and downloaded the e-book. First paragraph made me stop for a prayer of thanks: I knew I was in the best of hands. I could barely work and feed the family for the next two days, captivated and distracted by this amazing, compelling, heartfelt and brilliant story, wonderfully and vividly told. I could see it: I could SEE the view projected on the walls, and the wheat-colored dirt-and-dust outdoors, the steps and the blue and yellow jumpsuits, and feel terror during the big swim and long walk. It was beyond my deepest hope for a transporting, thrilling, heartbreaking and thought-provoking transcendant read. My heartfelt thanks to Mr. Howey, and may he write on and on and on and make tons of money so that he can have whatever he needs to make more books, and also be happy. What a gift. I am now going to buy all his other works, one by one. (this says I bought the book as a paperback, but in fact I bought it as an e-book.)
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|great for kids its easy and fun! my 4 year old loves it! cant wait to beat the time limit and points to get new buggy's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game it RULES<br />I'm not kidding<br /> Get this game and change your life<br /> But its a little pricy
B00B23O96A|2.0|What a disappointment! If Eric doesn't care enough about his music (or his fans) to put out at least a mediocre album, why should his listeners continue to listen (or care) about his music? There are thousands and thousands of GREAT artists and bands who never get listened to; terrific and gifted musicians who never get the light of day because they are unknown, but guys like Clapton put out clap-trap crap like this and and add more money to their pile and never look back - and don't care!<br />A couple of the half baked reggae songs are just okay, and \\"Gotta Get Over\\" is an enjoyable straight ahead rocker, but the rest...I mean, if i want to hear \\"All Of Me\\" or \\"Born to Lose\\" and \\"Goodnight Irene\\" (!) I'll go back and listen to the MUCH superior versions by Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and The Weavers (respectively); why does EC think he can do these songs better than the originals - and why does he think anyone cares?!<br />What a shame....
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina's back and better than ever.<br />Recommend: Your Body, Just a Fool, Blank Page, Lotus, Let There Be Love, Red Hot Kinda Love, Sing for Me, Light Up the Sky. The rest is awesome too.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I Bought the 1st, 2nd, etc. now onto the next. Love the series! Very like the Belgariad in many ways, though much more suited to adults.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Any movie, critics like or is deemed an \\"EPIC\\". I generally put on my do not watch list. Sherlock Homes is just what a movie should be. ENTERTAINMENT. With reference level Picture and Sound quality. Buy both movies. Slap them in your home theater system. And be entertained.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I purchased this to get some classic Pink Floyd.  I was not disappointed.  I was surprised to see the hits.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|First the obvious - the move is incredibly beautiful. The graphics are stunning.<br /><br />Now everything else... the writing somehow manages to be both incoherently muddled AND utterly predictable.<br /><br />Tough Rebel Kid who's smart (but somehow not smart enough to know where his dad disappeared to DESPITE BEING TOLD THE WHOLE STORY in Act I) falls into the grid and.... does pretty much exactly what you'd expect from start to finish.<br /><br />Also.. if companies are supposed to give away their digital property for free - which they seem to harp on a lot - why did we have to pay for this film?
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this is a fun game if you like the angry birds.  so far it has been a little too easy but I like the star wars themed birds.  for .99 cents what is there to complain about?
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Grandkids and myself enjoyed +++++<br />One of grandkids will be playing the Beast in a school production and found it was very helpful.<br /><br />Thank you
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I think the developers have been really clever to expand the series this way.  This is a fun game and not overly hard which I appreciate.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is a great CD.  Music is upbeat, fun to listen and sing with.  Harmonizing is fantastic.  Would highly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun. if you like horses this game is for you.  in this game you feed and play with the horses.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Enjoyed the true story drama and the great acting. I wasn't too familiar with the story so it was captivating and suspenseful until the end
B00AF6B22E|2.0|The movie plot was good but the movie was way to graphic for my taste I would now recommend this movie to my friends.
B000002L5I|2.0|I'm not sure why this is marketed as Kenny Wayne Shepherd. He does not sing the songs, nor does he write most of them. He is simply the lead guitar player in the band. Not sure how I would describe the sound of this record, it's kind of pop-blues. It reminds me more of Kenny Chesney than Lightnin Hopkins. On a positive note, the Dylan cover is pretty decent.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|What a great movie for older children and adults. would not recommend this movie for small children for it is not well versed.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Great DVD. Did what I wanted it to do. Satisfied.<br />(Ok, now I am just filling in minimum word requirements).
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|What a great movie for both adults and children 10 and up would not recommend for children under 10. good

B00008G7UF|4.0|This is a good romantic comedy but I would say &#34;cute&#34; over &#34;funny.&#34; Kline and Ryan have chemistry. It is okay.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I dare say it is my favorite of Jane Austen' s books so far.  There seemed to be some joke amidst real English decorum in each chapter.
0783233477|5.0|The background music is beautiful and Claire Forlani shines in her beauty.<br /><br />Hopkins is as usual very good and Brasd Pitt is good too.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|This movie was not good at all...there was absolutely no storyline and the ending was horrible...definitely did not do the game justice!  I would not waste your money.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I love English history and know a lot about it and, as such, some of the poetic license in this series in a historical sense bothered me but I liked the whole series in general.<br /><br />This is attractively presented like a book too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game  is really fun and safe. I gave it this rating because it is so interesting and provides so many activities! U will never get bored of it!<br />EXCELLENT App!
B005FITIGO|1.0|I think one would have to be fairly well educated about economics to grasp what was going on in this movie but, aside from that, it was very slow moving and had poor character development.<br /><br />There is a HBO movie called &#34;Too Big To Fail&#34; that is actually factual but much more entertaining if you are interested in the 2008 economic crisis. The HBO movie explains economics in a way that most of us can understand.<br /><br />If you have no idea what anybody is talking about in any depth it cannot be very enjoyable although Jeremy Irons makes a couple of good analogies in the movie. That is the only redeeming feature of this movie in my opinion.<br /><br />Watch &#34;too Big To Fail&#34; though...I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Bad ending too in my opinion with obvious symbolization.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoying the hunger games trilogy. Can't wait to start the next book to see how this all plays out!  Easy to get hooked.
B004LWZVZC|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie but found it slow moving, depressing in color and, while factual, boring for somebody who loves Lincoln and has read extensively about every aspect of his life and assassination. So, maybe I had higher hopes than usual although, in as far as being factual, it should have been absorbing for me and it was not. Actually, I would say it is boring in general. Not Redford's best movie although he has made movies such as &#34;The Changling&#34; that are very good and interesting as well as factual. Incidentally, that is a movie I would give 4-5 stars.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|i completely loved this book it was different from anything I've read i liked this book because it was similar to Peter Pan you know like how he had adventures and Dorothy had an adventure with the scarecrow, the Lion, and tin woodman,  so  I really enjoyed it and i think anybody who enjoys the types of books with fiction and adventure i recommend this book for you. Once you read the first 2 chapters u r going to be glued to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|I found is enjoyable and with enough twists to make it flow to the end. Matthew is convincing in the part.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Really, the only downside I see is the ads that pop up. I don't like 'em on my computer, and I don't like 'em with my apps. Period.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved season I, Season II it's even more awesome.. Great directing, acting and absolutely amazing screenplay, photography and dialog
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|This movie made me think about Apollo 11 - how do you build tension when everyone already knows how the story comes out?  'Argo' accomplishes it beautifully.  The dialogue is well done and very believable - the acting is superb.  The inclusion of Alan Arkin and John Goodman for a needed dose of comic relief every so often, balanced the serious nature of the quest at hand.<br />I am a fan of the Mitch Rapp book series (Vince Flynn) and I know that, forevermore, my hero will look precisely like Affleck in this movie.<br />Very, very entertaining.<br />And, yes, I ordered and read Mendez' book to get the entire back story - a good read as well.

0307352145|5.0|I've always known I was an introvert, but I never understood how profoundly that affected my way of being in the world until I read this book. I am also highly sensitive/reactive, and the connection Susan Cain makes between the two was one of life's major \\"aha!\\" moments for me. I've always thought that I'm not as smart as people think I am because I don't easily think of answers to complex questions on my feet, or that I'm passive-aggressive because I often prefer to express important thoughts in writing, or that I'm not that good with people because I need to withdraw from social situations at work and at home in order to recharge. This book helped me re-frame those negative thoughts about myself and to understand them as traits of introversion. It affirmed that my coping mechanisms are common strategies used by introverts and that they are not only appropriate for my personality, but also necessary for me to function optimally. It sounds cheesy, but I'm so much more okay with myself after reading this book; I feel much better equipped to deal with my personal and professional life and to express my authentic self to the world. Thank you, Susan Cain!
B0094M2O7C|3.0|Essentially a 90-minute action sequence with very little plot and logic. Still, fans of the the series will be entertained

B0050DZN4K|5.0|I have been using Feedly for some time, and I've been very pleased with it. Even though Google reader is going away, I won't even notice it's gone.
0525426345|5.0|I've read this book 3 times now. Twice via ebook and now once via my very own physical copy of the collector's edition. A little part of me had hoped for a personal John Green signature but the little surprise under the cover is good enough for me.<br /><br />I've seen reviews that claim Hazel and Augustus aren't believable as teenagers and all that jazz, and if it weren't for the fact that they're kids with terminal illnesses, one of them being very into literature, I might agree. Terminal illnesses make you grow up a little faster. Besides in very young children, this is almost always the case. And from personal experience with teenagers (my best friend happens to have just turned 18 in February), they are, without a doubt, believable characters. Even the way they text each other is so incredibly familiar to me. Augustus texts Hazel multiple times in a row, sometimes in all caps without punctuation, and it's exactly like I text others when my emotions are running rampant.<br /><br />I've read this book 3 times and I've cried every time. I've also laughed every time. It doesn't lose its humor after the first read and it definitely doesn't lose its knack for evoking tears from my eyeballs.<br /><br />I want this book to be read by everybody and I want everybody to love it. It's truly an easy read. It's not filled with ambiguous metaphors that are impossible to decipher. It's just so real and so light and so incredibly emotional on all parts of the spectrum and it is truly a great book.<br /><br />I call it John Green's second best work because I can't possibly get over my love for his book Paper Towns. But in actuality, TFIOS probably ties for first. It's just really hard to make that decision so I just choose not to.
B007L6VR12|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br /> Some may say 'Moonrise Kingdom' is charming and whimsical. Others might say it's simply trivial. Perhaps the best assessment is somewhere in between. One thing for sure is that the cinematography is a visual feast. Set in 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Pezance, it was actually shot around Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.<br /><br />'Moonrise' is formulaic up to a point. Quirky comedies usually feature protagonists who are outsiders, non-conformist, slightly emotionally unstable and victims of persecution by an established order. In this case, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop fit the bill. A year before the break into the 'Second Act' where Sam and Suzy run off to their 'Moonrise Kingdom', they become pen pals after meeting at a church performance of Noye's Fluddle. A year later, Sam, who has a history of acting out behavior, finds himself ostracized by his Scout troop and then is dropped by his foster family after he disappears at his 'Khaki Scout' summer camp. Suzy comes from a more 'stable' family of dysfunctional attorney parents but also has behavior problems, and ends up running off with her 'soul mate', the equally troubled Sam.<br /><br />Quirky comedies also feature a group (or groups) who persecute our quirky heroes. In this case, Sam is the subject of vituperation by his scout troop. Similarly, Suzy is rejected by her parents, who have no tolerance for her rebellious ways. Perhaps the most unpleasant scene in 'Moonrise Kingdom' is when the Scout Troop attempts to chase down Sam out in the forest. Fortunately, director Wes Anderson later redeems his antagonists. The scout troop realizes that they've been bullying Sam and finally decide to help him. Suzy's parents also realize the error of their ways and employing their legal acumen, aid Captain Sharp as he adopts Sam and prevents the Social Services matron from hauling Sam off to the Juvenile Refuge.<br /><br />With both actors playing wondrously against type, Bruce Willis and Edward Norton as Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), also play characters worthy of redemption. Sharp, who's been having an affair with Suzy's mother, Laura Bishop, ends the affair and later nobly adopts Sam. And Randy, who initially loses his scout troop after they split camp aiding Sam, saves his superior, Commander Pierce, after Pierce demotes him for incompetence. Only the Social Services matron, who represents bureaucracy, finds no redemption in Anderson's redemptive pageant.<br /><br />'Moonrise Kingdom' feels a bit too long especially when Sam and Suzy run away TWICE. And we also see one too many chases throughout the film. Nonetheless, Wes Anderson employs a number of great creative touches that distract us from the drawn out narrative. I'm referring of course to the fictional books he creates for Suzy as well employing the marvelous Benjamin Britten music.<br /><br />One must realize that Anderson's characters are farcical types--not meant to be at all realistic. Rather, he's gently poking fun at those neurotic type of adults who lack insight into their own behavior. Fortunately, Anderson ends things on a positive note, as most of the adults such as the Bishops and Captain Sharp, redeem themselves in the end. As for Sam and Suzy, it's sort of like the kid's version of 'Silver Linings Playbook'--amusing up to a point but slightly over baked. When all is said and done, 'Moonrise' is sometimes a little too cute for its own good. But look a little closer and you'll also see it's a tale of the power of redemption--which is no small thing.r />With both actors playing wondrously against type, Bruce Willis and Edward Norton as Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), also play characters worthy of redemption.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I played the first MC and loved it. This one is much better than the first MC. I haven't played 2 and 3 because ethey are still $6 who'll this was on sale for $1, so I'm lost on the plot. Its a really solid shoot that I would reccomend. the game has a great single player, even if I don't understand the plot, and awssome addicting multiplayer. This is a must buy for your device.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love the ponies of course! Plus you get to play games to level them up, awesome. Food is grown for coin and the ponies (depending on their star level) work in the shops that sell the food, it really was quite addicting once I figured out it wasn't like other games in that way. The one thing I would suggest to is spending a little time on the details of the ponies and the way they walk on the grass, kinda weird, also when zoomed in navigation is a little jerky. And like most other games in this category your patience will be tested. Haha! The backdrop of mountains and castle are unique and not stationary. Overall fun time waster that keeps me coming back for more! =)...ponies!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Loved this book! Amazingly rich in detail. Beautifully told. A fascinating adventure about the depths of humanity, religion and animals.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I'm not a fan of sports movies but I do like Eastwood so I watched this movie.  It's more of a father/daughter movie with a sports background.  Some of it was uncomfortable to watch because I can identify with a man that can't do simple things, like getting a car into or out of a garage, as well as he once could but is still as good as ever at others.
B0033VUH6A|5.0|Shows the war as the no-win situation it is. This film should be required viewing to all folks wanting to join the service and the politicians who start these wars.  It does a good job of displaying the day-in/day-out risking of your life for no real, tangible reasons.  Who is really around to appreciate the job being done for the risks being taken?
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|If you're looking for an action thriller with car chases and butt kicking then go elsewhere.  If you're looking for some good acting and real life situations then this is your movie.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|This case is excellent and I think every person with a Voyager Pro/Pro+ should own one. The appearance is classy and simple (the branding is subtle and not garish and annoying), and the outer material is soft but very sturdy and hasn't scratched or otherwise been damaged even by heavy day to day use. The stitching is well done and holds up to being pulled out of tight pockets (including jeans) without fraying or other damage.<br /><br />The inside is soft and fuzzy and fits the earpiece perfectly. There's no room for it to wiggle around at all once it's inserted (if it's wiggling, it's not fully inserted) and the velcro on the flap always closes securely.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because there's no belt clip. You've GOT to have a pocket to put this in. Luckily it's small enough it'll fit in most pants pockets without a problem (even the small ones on windbreakers), but if your phone is ringing it can be a bit frustrating if you've got to dig it out of a tight pocket that's got 2 or 3 other things in it.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I waited until both Part One and Part Two were available before I watched either one.  There was nothing special about this because it was just a build up to Part Two.  It is necessary though to see it first.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I just love my little broom . This broom picks up everything. I love the way it goes around things with ez. I use it every day. Love it.
B0023S50DO|4.0|Sci-fi is my favorite genre and end of the world scenarios are what I like.  This is a good one.  I saw it in the theaters originally and watched it again on Amazon.  It's  cookie cutter asteroids are coming but well done never the less.
B0085157B8|2.0|Let's face it, we all know the reason your watching this movie. It's an action movie with a little more on the side. If you're into that sort of thing, then I have a feeling you'll like this movie.<br /><br />Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one. It's terrible.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|This was an item on the list a person wanted for a present.  I did not hear it and can only attest to the fact that it arrived on time
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The fact that I got this for free from Amazon's App of the Day, made this an awesome app from the start.<br /><br />I think that this app is a great idea, and I'm not really a power user, so this fits my needs perfectly.
B0000025H6|4.0|This was an item on the list a person wanted for a present.  I did not hear it and can only attest to the fact that it arrived on time
B00129H7VS|5.0|Never, have I ever, seen such a series with the production value of Band of Brothers. Kind words don't do this series justice.
006016848X|4.0|This was an item on the list of books a person wanted for a present.  I did not read it and can only attest to the fact that it arrived on time.
B0018AM1YY|4.0|There are about5-6 neil young songs that I like. It was worth the 2.99 to get them all the album
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Cannot get subway surfers to update to kindle fire!! Help! Why will it not work?  We love the game but want the updates!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|What a unique and fascinating story. The movie unravels slowly and very engaging. I imagine that hollywood will be making a blockbuster out of it soon enough...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is good game just don't use all your coins cause then you will have to wait to get more. that it is a good game but hard to.
B005LF9IO8|3.0|The main actress is great, but the story line is bit weak. Some of the action scenes waffle between intense to ridiculous. But all in all, it was entertaining.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I got a pair of these about a year ago. I basically threw them out 6 months ago. Sound quality was great, loved the design as well. Where the G930s fall flat is build quality, like a lot of logitech products I have owned over the last couple years. First place they broke was at the joint above the ear where the screws are. The plastic slowly cracked until the portion between the screws fell out, leaving them nothing to put pressure against. So now one side of the headset was kind of flopping around, but I could still manage when I could get the screws to sit on the small piece of plastic still connected. Then the padding started flaking and leaving black crap on my ears. Finally I lowered the boom on the mic one day, no abnormal movement or even quickly, and the mic snapped right off where the plastic has begun cracking there unnoticed.<br /><br />I really liked this headset before it fell apart, but I gave it a 2/5 because a product at this price point should not fall apart after less than a year. The two star is an acknowledgement of the sound quality and convenience of the wireless headset when it was still in one piece.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|It was hilarious and touching at the same time. Highly recommend it! The acting of the main characters is superb.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This book is everything and more for the fantasy/paranormal reader. The conclusion, for now, was absolutely superb! So many twists and turns, ups and downs, lefts and right. You will be guessing, and getting it wrong :-), the whole time. Please read the books in order... definitely not a stand alone book. ENJOY!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i could not put this book down took me less then a week to read and I will probably read it again in the near future
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Not that good and was always going off track than some how came back to the dance and also Greg was really freaked out by rowlly which I don't understand
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this game for my wife for a present based on all of the positive things I had heard about it.  She hadn't heard about it so there it sat for months until we played it last weekend...and played and played it.<br /><br />It's about as simplistic a game as can be.  It's a standard platform where you run around the remains of a lost empire.  It was a very short game (3 hours)  but in that time, my wife, myself, and our kids were mesmerized.  The landscapes were surreal, the music was surreal, it was amazing.<br /><br />Even for how short it was, I still gave it 5 stars.  It was that good.  For $20, we couldn't have taken the kids to a movie and this was so much more.<br /><br />Throw in the extra few games that are on the Collector's Edition disk (Flow is also pretty mesmerizing) and it's a wonderful bundle.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|It should be re named as the correct guide...every school student should be reading this one...a real eye openner and should be spread to all schools in Australia as a wake up call...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie before I read the book which is unusual for me. There were certain spots that the movie departed from  the book, but still enjoyed both. I'm going to read the next installment before the movie version comes out.
1250006341|5.0|I'm a big fan and the book just enhanced my opinion. Looking forward to more  on the next season and another book.
B00947N6UG|5.0|LOVED this movie. Wish I had made it out to see it in the theaters in 3D!!!! Must say though.......worse commentary on a CGI movie  I've ever sat through. First half++ was just self-congratulatory & nods to all the animators/voices. Dont get me wrong, everyone who worked on this movie did an AMAZING job, but the commentary is usually for the general people to be clued in on the deeper back story/views.....not commentary for the creators to their fellow peers in their field.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Much better that I anticipated.  I will probably watch it again in a few months. Good action. Not cheesy like some comic-based movies. And the ending where he .... Psych!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from this novel but I completely enjoyed it on so many levels.  The main character, Don is completely without ego and quite often insight into the social minutiae, but he is a strong and confident fellow in most respects and his journey to find love is very amusing.  Having the main character as \\"suffering\\" from a autism spectrum disorder may have been poorly characterised or insensitive but in fact, the author was able to highlight the many positive characteristics that may be possessed and this was a great strength of the novel. As a novel it was entertaining, well written and plotted, quite funny throughout and as a reader, I developed a strong empathy with the main character.  The other thing that I liked was that it didn't preach, where there were opportunities to do so and generally allowed the characters to stand on their own \\"feet\\".  Well done to the author, you have created a book that makes one think about the story well after is finished.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Good graphics and it reminds me a little of Mario Kart. Fun to play for those boring moments! Woo Hoo
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|have had this game on my android phone for a while.  much better on my kindle fire.  It is a little glitchy and slow right now but hoping that will pass.  really enjoy the game.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I rate books based on how they make me feel. I love when a book consumes me. I can't think about anything else. For hours, I sit in one place and just read. I smile, I laugh, I cry. And this book did this. This book is now a part of me. I finished it and immediately felt inspired to live my life to the fullest. &#34;Slammed&#34; taught me something, and that's why it deserves five stars.
B004G606K8|5.0|I first read this book right after it was first released.  This is the first time I have re-read it in about 10 years and it has lost none of its magic.<br /><br />I highly recommend it and the rest of the chronicles.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I started this book, but when I started it, I was immediately hooked. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I have read many great books, but this definitely tops the list as my favorite book of all time.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Holds my camera and all my lenses and accessories.  Stored extra stuff in the bag when I flew, and used it as a carryon.  I like the flexibility of the dividers.  The zipper tabs came off, though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So well done! I watched all three seasons over the period of a week and I am impatient for season 4!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie was very well done.  Kudos to DreamWorks for another great movie.  At times a little dark for small children but a clever way of putting a twist on the famous fairy tale people of our times.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this game is so super entertaining!  this is fun and exciting, if I could play this every day I would.
B000Q76K24|3.0|I was a little confused with the plot also the ending was kinda weird I wasn't sure where they were going.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Christopher must be a perfectionist in sound and audio technology. But if you are a half deaf music lover like me, there ain't anything wrong with this album. Sure, it's not new material. Tough for a dead man to record new music. Plus it was recorded before 1970. Tough to make 40+ year old recordings perfect. Listened to it again last night with friends, and they agreed that it is good, too. If you are in search of the perfect, out of this world sound, don't waste your money. But I'm glad I'm spending the cash for this cool cd.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It wasn't what I would normally read, but I enjoyed the change.<br />If you normally like Nicolas Sparks, I don't see any reason you wouldn't love this one.
0062014536|5.0|I loved this book! I thought it was a perfect ending to the series. I know a lot of people had a problem with the ending of this book but I thought the ending was incredibly beautiful.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|every 007 fan have the cds from all the soundtracks, great to have the hits in one cd, nice cover art
B00AFEY354|4.0|Bought this movie for my daughter's birthday. She read the book and fell in love with it, so I surprised her with the movie. I ordered it before it was out on DVD. I ordered it with other items, and this was the first to arrive, earlier than I expected. My daughter and I were super excited. Good movie!
B00845MRKE|5.0|love the different version of the film. cool book of picture, and special toy, must have if you are a fan
B005COO1X6|4.0|I bought this book as a cheap way to see if I would like using the Kindle app on my Android phone. It was a very good book and has me loving reading on my phone! It was a short book, but really good! A great choice as my first trial with Kindle! I'm a collector of Stephen King books and look forward to reading more of his kindle exclusives.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|in. the beginning I thought it was a girl. as I read on I thought they could make an awesome movie!
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I purchased this soundtrack to try out the Amazon MP3 free app on my phone. I love the soundtrack and the movie. I'm still not sure how I feel about the MP3 app. Has me confused a little, but I'm sure I just need to get used to it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app. It is easy to use and the dragons are amazing. My kids love playing it just as much as me.
B003Q6CUAI|3.0|It was interesting and contained helpful hints and recipes, but not enough scientific proof for my preference.  It covered everything it proposed it would
B006Q1SQCQ|4.0|Effective memory techniques date back to the days of the ancient Fomans and Greeks. Author Harry Lorayne based his books on a solid study of the history of centuries of development of training methods to help people improve their memory performance. With the MEMORY BOOK, anyone can find specific methos to help them remember Names and Faces, Numbers related to phones and addresses, Speeches, Lists of all Kinds.  I agree with Lorayne, there is no such thing as a bad memory. There are only UNTRAINED memories.  Practicing the techniques presented in this book can help anyone overcome poor memory performance. But, don't expect reading this book Cover-to-Cover to immediately make you a Memory-Whiz.  Practice, Practice, Practice, that's what it takes to get to carnegie Hall.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Liked it,,,,,  keep you riveted, wanting to see what on earth next...  couldnot put it down and when finished I was disappointed so ordered the next two books in trilogy
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was such a fun game.  Great puzzles and hidden objects.  I will be looking at other G5 games and would highly recommend.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Liked it.......  It completed the story for me - made me understand why Christian was the way he is.... Liked it.
1250006341|5.0|This book is a must have for all &#34;Downtonphiles&#34;, It is well written and makes you feel as though you are there at the filming. Loaded with great and interesting facts about the cast and crew. Lots of lovely photos,  make it the perfect &#34;coffee table book&#34; to entertain your guests, while they wait for you to bring the tea !! A great gift to Mom on Mothers Day. Always...fast shipping,great pricing, and excellent care taken that the books arrive in very good condition.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I love my Kindle HD ,I agree with the other customers that the cable should have been included in the box with the device , would be nice if Amazon would ship the cable to their Kindle clients per request.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|- amazing characters and such a complex world, it's a real page-turner. If you like fantasy or even adventure and intrigue set in a realm and time of knights and battles then you will love this.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well, Argo was a good movie...do I think it was an award winning film, not really.  I rented it, glad I didn't buy it as it is a 1 time film. You won't regret spending the 5 bucks to rent it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I heard the song, We are Young, and just had to have this cd, Some Nights.  I love it.  The very first songs rock it out, and I love the rest!  If you love Fun., you'll love this cd!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I click on it and nothing happens. Not sure what is going on. I could use some help on this one.
B0092MJ6B6|5.0|This is Glen Danzig s best album! A must for anyone loving metal. Just wish more of todays music would look to classics like this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game for when you have nothing to do. passes the time quickly and it offers a large variety of games.
B000EUDAWG|5.0|EXCELLANT TOY. BOUGHT THEM AS A GAG GIFT FOR MY GIRLS WHO HATE SPIDERS. ARRIVED ON TIME. I'M VERY SATISFIED.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Great movie. The online reception was great. No buffering. Watched the entire movie with no buffering interruptions. My family wants to buy the blu ray edition after watching this.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|It is true this movie is a work of art.  The visuals are stunning and beautiful.  I understood the movie and enjoyed it.  I purchased the movie as a possible book and film study for my high school seniors.  Not sure they will make it through the movie without falling asleep as there are many slow sections.  That being said, many of the slow parts are complemented with thought-provoking scenary and action.  That is part of the beauty and mystery of the movie.  I do not understand the many reviews saying this was a horror movie.  Horror, in film, is a lot different than a horrific life experience.  It is not a \\"horror movie\\".  As for the animals...one of the themes of the film is survival and also living on the planet with other species which God has created (all unique in their own way).  Animals eat one another in the wild and we eat animals too.  My domestic cats sitting here on the table beside me just ate their tuna and Fancy Feast, which, I believe still has meat in it.  If you watched this with your children and they cried all the way through...I don't believe you.  None of the scenes with animals eating one another were even slightly gruesome.  There was not any blood or carnage.  Reviewers, please know what you are talking about before you review...and focus on the story.  If you do watch this with your children...there is a lot you will need to explain to them.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining. We really enjoyed watching this show. The characters seem real and you can relate to some of them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game never get old. even after you have concored all of the levels you can go back and start again and again
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is one if my all time favorite books. I have read this book 4 times and would happily read it again right now. I love all the characters and I wish she wrote the stories of Travis other brothers
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have found this game to be very entertaining.  The graphics are pretty good and I like that it has a hint button.
B004K58GSO|5.0|This is one of the all time greats for the Duke!  Hope some of his other films are also on Prime.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed 50 Shades....  The story moved along very well and the principals in the story were very well developed.
0061537969|1.0|I was intrigued to read a dog's perspective but the author was not able to tell the story wirhout giving the dog god-like abilities to know everything at all times. Also, the author injected useless details serving no purpose except maybe to tell his own story (tell what you know) except that only works if what you know has relevance. Otherwise its just bad story telling. The story was very Hollywood with melodrama sprinkled throughout.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  A &#34;who done it&#34; that has you in suspense to the end.  I liked the setting, the characters and the plot.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I was looking for an alternative to Google Reader since they put up the notification that they'd be shutting it down in July. This was an easy seamless transition that imported all my feeds. I love the graphic nature of feedly versus the look of Google Reader and am glad I made the switch. Lots of cool features and shortcuts that work well on my tablet.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very dissatisfying ending for my taste.  People really can't feel the way these two did about one another and stay together, can they?
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Traditionally the worst thing an aging rocker can say is, \\"Now here's something from our new album.\\"  Not this time. I haven't been the biggest fan of the later Bowie music, but this one is different.  It has the same feel as the late 70's early 80's Bowie, but it doesn't sound old.  Bowie's voice is older, but is still solid.  I was surprised when this album popped up from seemingly nowhere.  But I was more surprised at how much I like it.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Lots of interesting twist, and a good story line .but will there be a next one with the mystery ending
B003JFJHVQ|5.0|Story of older man obsessed with a young woman. Great writer ,loved the book.A must read so insightful! Made into a wonderful movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really really like this game and it can be adicting if you let it its the beet game l 'ge ever played I hope all of you out there can play and enjoy this game as much as me! !!!!!!!!!
0761163808|5.0|I love the book, and my elementary students are completely enthralled with the motion.  However, the book was advertised as new/unused and that was not the condition of the book.  The hardcover corners were all bent and there were scratches and a small tear in the binding.  Not really what was advertised!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This Book Was Okay For My Kid ,But It Could Be More Advanced With A Little More Words On Each Page. I Like The Humor Though.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Awesome aftermarket CPU cooler.So much bigger and more effective than the factory supplied one.Used for my first build and it was a easy install.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It takes hours or even days for something to be for example hatched,built,evolved and stuff. I really wish there was an easier way to get gold.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Used this for my first computer build.Installed easy, and runs great.The fan that comes with it is kind of lame but hey that's what aftermarket products are for.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The map is very small and the sky goes in plain colors. There is only animals that give meat/wool etc.but you can not breed then. There is a few kind of monsters and there isn't even a nether. Wish the game was like the other versions of minecraft
B002PTHKNY|2.0|As with the last four releases from these guys I am surprised everytime theyr elease something and legions of mindless fans flock to their defense.<br />Let's get this straight, if the lead singer wasn't Vedder, this guys fizzle right off.  Secondly if they had releases any other album beside Ten as their debut, they would not have got a second chance at making another release.<br /><br />If  they put out Backspacer, Riot act, Vitology, Avocado etc...etc. They would have had a hard time convincing the record label to give them a chance, and had they did. 75% of the sales would have been gone from lack of any type of following and they would have disbanded in '93.<br />Had they pooled every Album since Ten they may have been able to scrape together another fine cd from the decent songs on all those cd's.<br />Jjust sucks listening to them and hear one or two songs that are grooving then have your speakers blown out due to a half put together song that they think will be well accepted by 13 year old's because it is 150 decibles. Just makes me want to turn it off immediately. No continuity at all in the layout of their music.<br /><br />Apparently no producer has the mind to tell them to turn it down or leave out so much filler.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is okay, but getting free gems is not easy. There is a lot of purchasing to get something to get the free gems.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|It is a free game and its a good thing.  Would not work and was just not worth the trouble.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You will enjoy this cool app so you can can play and play instill you are tired or your battery runs out.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|free was the price and still paid too much.  would not work after installed...kept returning to menue. Not a good value.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a fun stained glass puzzle set. Plus it has more puzzle sets included, such as paper puzzles, stone puzzles, wood puzzles and fabric puzzles.<br /><br />They 're all variants of the same idea.  You put in pieces from the pieces showing on the right.  The different sets are examples of doing work using different media.<br /><br />The puzzles get harder as you advance through a set.<br /><br />I find it very addictive.<br /><br />The music stinks but you can turn it off in options.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|When someone asks me &#34;What is your favorite movie?&#34;, I don't even have to think. Within seconds I respond with &#34;Burlesque&#34;. With that being said, I know every word to every song. The soundtrack is amazing. Christina and Cher are simply flawless.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Middle earth comes to life again.  Very well done.  There is special attention to detail from the original Hobbit and Simarilian. The bonus video on production is worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for Horse lovers it's fun u get experience with horses knowledge on how to groom and feed them.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|All I ever knew of Henry VIII was Richard Burton's rendition. This is completely different, and unexpectedly good. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is amazing as the handsome young Henry: well-educated, disciplined, and ruthless all rolled up into one. The sets are lush and the costumes are gorgeous. I have seen the entire series 3 times, and I still find it engaging. I also spent a lot of time with Wikipedia looking up all of these characters, and the series is pretty historically accurate. By the way, it's rated R for a reason, so be aware of both the bedroom scenes and the beheadings. I do use the fast-forward button from time to time. Enjoy!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyable. Fast easy read.<br />I liked the first novel better but will definitely read the third.<br />She is a good writer
B0052L2VFO|3.0|This was too much violence for me, but I purchased it solely because I adore Viggo Mortensen.  There are English subtitles which is nice.  If not for Viggo, though, this would not have gotten my interest.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The sequel to Temple Run has fun new obstacles but keeps the fun pass-time's idea and overall appeal. Couldn't get it fast enough when it came out.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|...entertaining. If, like me, you watched the movie and thought it was awful...read the book. The book fills in the MANY holes that are in the movie. The story in the book is so much more richer than what was presented in the movie. I'm not a big fan of romance, but Sparks is so popular, I figured I would watch the movie. The movie disappointed so much, I decided to give the book a try. It was an engaging story, the characters are developed fairly well, but it was predictable.  Hey, if you have a few free hours on your hand, reading this one wouldn't be the worst waste of time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved it it so much it was awesome but I wish that I could the<br />Building of Hades halie dehn
B000SEIDR0|4.0|I like how Michael Pollan explains the dangers of our growing and processing of foods very well.  It is a good read with lots of information.
B006PTL1GC|3.0|No, Jungian.  I knew the story, this is a Hollywood mishmash with good parts and questionable.  I like Kiera, find her lovely, but am not into S&M.  Hated to see her involved in it, but a great actress has to  sometimes do parts that stretch her beyond the &#34;norm&#34;.  Though a bit psychologically dark, it has some accuracies (and some glaring errors done for entertainment), but is a good introduction to understanding the Vienna school of psychoanalytics in those days.  Not for everyone, but otherwise good.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Get this app.x. x. D d f f d f dj j h h jj j j j j j i u j
B0054NRC6S|1.0|I wanted to watch this movie and thought I was getting it for free because I was a prime member. Truth is, you can't charge for a movie trailer, and that's what this is. It's not even the movie. What's the point?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome series. I'm passed the zombies and into the characters. There are only a handle of series I bother with and this is on top, with Breaking Bad, Dexter and Game of Thrones close behind. You feel for the characters, nothing is sacred, the characters you love may die next week. Just like it would happen in a real zombie filled world. You care for them and some you hate to like. Now they have some great music that just adds more to the experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Okay, this book made me a little crazy... in a good way. OMG!  If you can avoid the spoilers, and you love snarky dark humor, and deeply complex characters, then dive in!  The water's fine... just don't drink it - and keep your eyes out for sharp objects in the shadows.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I loved this game, but once I got to level 24 and had raised a whole bunch of money the game reset its self!
0374533571|5.0|Modern, complex, with unexpected reveals...  I like the unusual plot and characters, the quirky story, the use of psychology in the human condition.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|umm I was disappointed with this game by looking at other reviews and pica I figured it would be great but no it is super hard! :(
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is amazing. The suspense, buildup, everything makes it seem the characters are actually living and breathing human beings. Excellent book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its so much fun. You have to jump out of the way of the trains, jump and roll over and under the barriers, and try not to get caught by the inspector!
B0055SWM08|4.0|A gentle, fascinating game with help as you need it. Taxing enough to make you think, but not frantic. A bit like patience but without the frustration. Just enjoy it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Fantastic movie!  People say that money doesn't buy happiness. It's true; however, you can be unhappy with comfort and, consequently, less unhappy.  It is a must-see movie.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Disney did there homework with this movie. It's such a love letter to anyone that's ever played a video game or been to an arcade !!!
B000002KNU|5.0|I loved this album when I had it on vinyl. I played it over and over. This is thee best T Heads album in my opinion. This is such a fun, upbeat, quirky cd. Listening to it now, I think back how new and different this sound was back in the late 70's. This is a classic album. It was one of the first of that newer punk wave of sound that was more palatable  for people looking for a change from the 10 minute guitar solo, sappy love ballads, smoke machine, long big haired dudes. I love this album. It goes well with the Ramones, Blondie, Elvis Costello, Television, Buzzcocks, early punk sound. A must have.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|Any TV show that you have to send your child out of the room in order to watch should give you pause. The first 2 episodes of the show were simply ridiculous. Every 15 minutes the drama, for what it was, completely ground to a halt in order to introduce the Bob Guccione Penthouse soft core porn scene, entirely inessential to the plot. In one case you had your now politically correct gay sex scene, in another your few rapes. At some point the directors and writers must have come to their senses because all the sex scenes disappeared - at the start of episode 3. At this point, naturally, the storyline, for what it is, began to improve. By episode 5 or 6 the show got dramatically better and by the end was excellent. But anyone hoping for a consistently excellent show ought to look elsewhere or at least have the patience to wade through the first few episodes. Personally speaking I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth (the TV show) much more. It has more drama, more energy, less inessential sex porn violence, and a more rational story line.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is  wonderful game if u won't a  horse in the future it shows u how to care for one.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I have not finished it but I like it because it is challenging and a bit different than other games.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I gave this movei a 4 star because it was intertaining and had a lot of action in it.  Will Smith is an actor that makes a good movie happen.
B008EZVNFE|3.0|My husband and I listen to all kinds of music. Though We have no doubt that Ms. Havas is very talented, it was too much of the same sounding thing on one album for us. We bought the album because music critics in several magazines highly recommended it. We thought it was ok
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An amazing game! Sooo engaging. The graphics are near perfect. Great game to clear your mind but have fun at the same time
B007PLRM9Y|5.0|I love Ms Gardots music. Her other albums are timeless and so is this one. It is different then the other ones and still spectacular.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is Awsome because I can build anything. I also like that it has monster's and baby animals. I have the computer version and that is really fun to.<br /> People who think it is stupid because it is just a bunch of blocks and monster's have weird names don't know anything about minecraft.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app ever!  It is so easy to use when searching for scriptures.  I like comparing different versions.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|This is also one of Connelly's best Harry Bosch novels although it too was written several years ago.  I recommend it highly.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I am an avid fan of musicals and Phantom of the opera is one of my favorites. I loved it!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch novel. I have read practically all of them and really enjoy reading them before i go to sleep.  They make super bedtime reading.
B00008973A|4.0|This is one of my favorite musicals. I loved the singing and dancing.I wish I had seen it on broadway.
B00633W614|5.0|I love reading family chronicles and this is one of a series of books in that vein. The author's pattern is to take each character and describe his or her experiences from each of their perspectives as the book progresses, although the writing does not resemble the type of movie where everything comes to a halt and then begins over again (&#34;Memento&#34;, a really tedious movie).  The novel continually moves forward in time.  The second book continues the lives of the Cliftons and their progeny.  I am looking forward to the third book being released at the middle of April 2013.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|This movie was raw and gritty and Fassbender does an amazing job or really displaying the misery of his addiction and obsession. And his inability to have a healthy relationship.
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|Absolutely terrible! Couldn't be a more appropriate title...(something you would throw away). If you want to hear how an album of this style should be done, pick up Boz Scaggs \\"Memphis\\"
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have burned thru 4 other calendar apps before finding this one. All I REALLY wanted was a calendar that you could see your events on, without having to click on the individual dates. I loooove that I can just look at the month and see all my events easily listed on the calendar, just like a regular calendar. It has great icons, lists, &amp; other great features too - but my selling point was the ease of just looking at my calendar and being able to see all the month's events laid out. I also find that the repeating feature is very handy.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|Was available on the Kindle market...but doesn't work.  Data won't load.  Tried several things but can't get it to work.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The book is very good holds your attention. I have read quite a few of his books and have enjoyed all of them.
B00866H7SS|5.0|a book that is impossible to put down. very additive reading. cant wait to start reading the next book. a
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching my 4 year old daughter get excited about playing this game. It has taught her some basic medicine and care that she has applied in real life. Very well-executed app. 5 stars.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Loved this series, watched all three seasons.  Didn't want it to end. Can't wait for the new season to start.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of those books that captures you, you become so invested with the characters that you just can't stop reading. It's simply beautiful.
B008Y78M60|4.0|So far as I can tell, the movie hewed pretty close to the facts of the trial of Mary Surratt for conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln.  The focus was on the young lawyer who was pressed into service defending her and the utter travesty of justice committed in her case.  Robert Redford, the director and producer, obviously had in mind the story's relevance to current risks that vengeance against terrorists will override fundamental liberties and legal process.  The acting was very good, and the numerous villains played their parts well.  Interesting that the young lawyer, ostracized for defending Surratt, left the law and ended up the first editor of the newly-founded Washington Post.  Nice period portrait of the city of Washington, the buildings, costumes, and interiors of that era.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This was my first sigma force novel. A nice intro, the characters are deep and all have problems and issues which make them seem real or at least plausible. Nobody has special powers, nobody is Rambo. The entire time you read the novel you are constantly thinking and working out solutions yourself.  It's a great mystery, suspense story. I'd recommend it if it were your cup of tea. I enjoyed it even though I mostly read science fiction.
0316044695|5.0|the whiteny houstons, britney spears and other mainstream artist dont compare what this man has accomplish. only very true american hero is one that sacrafices all in the name of this nation. that one man is marcus luttrell. an incredible true story of heroism, adversity and sacrafice. would recommend for any red blooded american. however, his not very fond of liberals.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson did as good a job as Jordan would have done on this one, the last book of the Wheel of Time
0062082353|5.0|i would say 95% of this book was written by chris kyle. where as other books are written by the co-author. chris is raw. he doesnt BS. he has straight forward feeling about war, brotherhood, military, SEAL teams, relationships, politics, guns etc......woudnt recommend it for the liberal types.
1457514508|3.0|This was a pleasantly quick read, something appropriate to take to the beach or on an airplane. I really wanted to like the book.  It started off well and then devolved into a series of unbelievable coincidences that eliminated any semblance of believability.<br /><br />The story felt contrived and over plotted. Even in the most melodramatic soap opera one would not find so many connivances.<br /><br />At the center of the narrative the widowed members of the Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club meet daily in the local park to walk their canines, enjoy an early cocktail disguised in red plastic cups, gossip about their neighbors and mourn the expected loss of founding member, Thelma Elliott, who is dying of cancer and leaving behind an attractive, soon to be eligible widower, who is slated to become prey before poor Thelma breathes her last.<br /><br />Peripheral stories involve an unemployed Englishman with off-shore bank accounts who cares for his baby while his wife works as a nurse, a dumb as a box of rocks woman who works at the makeup counter at Macy's and dreams of becoming a model and constantly enters contests, an elderly man who never uses the poopa scoopa to clean up after his pooch and the matriarch of the dog walking club with a secret room that not even her deceased husband or maid could enter.<br /><br />The entire story could only work as a screwball comedy from Hollywood's heyday.  For me it just didn't work as a murder mystery, a sociological study of people or any other genre.  It was ok.  But I wouldn't encourage anybody to rush out and buy it.
B004CEUEWE|3.0|Right off the bat, I want to make it clear that I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the characters, the pacing, the set design, the cinematography, most of the dialogue and the locations were excellent. Affleck made a pretty descent back story as well. There are only a small handful of slight changes I felt would have made this movie better.<br /><br />First, I would suggest they cast Robert DeNiro for Ben Affleck, Al Pacino for Jon Hamm, Val Kilmer for Jeremy Renner, Amy Brenneman for Rebecca Hall, Ashley Judd for Blake Lively, Tom Sizemore for Owen Burke and Jon Voight for Pete Postlethwaite.  Also, I would suggest that they filmed the movie in the backdrop of Los Angeles. Finally, I would suggest they called the movie \\"HEAT.\\"<br /><br />Because that's what this movie was. Like I said earlier, I really enjoyed this movie, but I couldn't help draw all the parallels to the Michael Mann original.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Outlander(released July/08) stars,among others Jim Caviezel as Kainan,Sophia Myles as Freya,Jack Huston as Wulfric,John Hurt as Hrothgar,Cliff Saunders as Boromir,and Ron Perlman as Gunnar.This is a story set in Nordic lands long ago,and it successfully combines a futuristic flavour to the mix to create a surprisingly good and solid film.<br />The story finds us in the early part of the 8th century in Norway.A spaceship,from parts unknown,crashes into a remote lake there.Out comes two of its passengers and one perishes.It seems their world tried to colonize another planet that was inhabited by creatures called Morwen's,that looked like dragons of our folklore.They tried to exterminate them,but they were unsuccessful in getting them all and one got on board Caviezel's ship which wreaked havoc,causing his abrupt crash landing on Earth.Caviezel is the one who remains alive,and after a quick update on his location and the history of the Earth and its language(they obviously had been here before),Caviezel sets off to explore his surroundings.He comes upon a village that has been recently razed to the ground,but he is soon taken prisoner.The head of a local Viking tribe(Hurt)accuses him of killing the entire village.Caviezel claims he is hunting for a dragon but is laughed at.<br />Since the village that was razed,was under the auspices of another local tribe king(Perlman),Hurt is afraid that he will blame their tribe for killing his.However before he can send word Perlman and his minions come a-calling,with a raid on Hurt's village.The attack is repelled but Perlman and his men are set for another attack not far away.Before they can carry it out the Morwen jumps them and they flee towards Hurts village.Only a handful manage to make it inside and all get to see first hand that the Morwen is now the real culprit in the village razing and the deaths of the people.Caviezel is slowly welcomed into Hurts tribe and with his help they will try to capture and kill the Morwen.<br />A large trench is dug out,surrounded by a wooden pen filled with flammable whale oil.They lure the creature into it and set it ablaze.For the moment it looks like the creature is finally dead,but the women,all huddled in large hut,are being attacked by a younger and smaller Morwen.As the men rush to save them the big/mother Morwen leaps from the fire,wreaks havoc and flees,killing Perlman and taking the kings daughter.Caviezel realizes their metal swords aren't strong enough and he dives to his sunken ship to retrieve stronger material.They use it to forge new weapons and they drop down into the village well which leads them into a vast cavernous area.They follow their noses which leads them to the Morwen's lair.They first encounter the smaller Morwen whom they eventually dispatch.The final battle comes down to Caviezel hanging on for dear life over the edge of a precipice,with the Morwen holding onto his one arm.With a final swipe of his sword,the Morwen falls to its death.<br />Caviezel returns to a homing beacon he had originally set up.As a search and rescue ship comes within viewing range he destroys the beacon,which leaves him deliberately stranded.He returns to the village and becomes its king.Unbeknownst to Caviezel,the kings daughter had followed and witnessed his destroying of the beacon and the spacecraft over head.This secret she will take to her grave.<br />The story has just enough of a unique twist on things as to keep one interested throughout.The acting is solid all around,especially with John Hurt and Ron Perlman.Mr.Perlman's appearance as the rival Norse king is all too short,but being the good actor he is,he makes the most of it.Caviezel doesn't make the most charismatic of leading men,but his shortcomings are covered rather well by the supporting cast.The special effects were particularly well done and the scenery is to die for.It was shot in Canada's maritimes,with Gros Morne Provincial Park(a UNESCO heritage site)in Newfoundland,front and center.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound here with 27(!)deleted and alternate scenes,commentary,animatics,visual effects tests and production design galleries.<br />All in all a surprisingly good film.The premise at first glance sounded a bit hokey,but the interesting plot along with the great cast elevated it above the average.3 1/2-4 stars.Recommended.nter.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound here with 27(!)deleted and alternate scenes,commentary,animatics,visual effects tests and production design galleries.<br />All in all a surprisingly good film.The premise at first glance sounded a bit hokey,but the interesting plot along with the great cast elevated it above the average.3 1/2-4 stars.Recommended.

B001F9Y2CM|5.0|I set out to add the Abba songs from the movie Mamma Mia that I did not have to my collection.  I didn't want to just buy the Mamma Mia album because I wanted the songs as actually performed by Abba.  I discovered that the songs were scattered throughout all of Abba's 8 original albums.  I looked through their collection albums, but inevitably at least one of the songs would be missing.  This set is the best because it includes ALL of their songs, together for one very reasonable price.  In addition to the hits, you also get all of the songs from the albums that you didn't know before, many of them also incredible songs.  I couldn't be happier.  I am wallowing in Abba mania.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I played high school football with the director, Genndy Tartakovsky, in Chicago so I guess my review might be considered a little biased because I have supported him since he was an unknown. My kids and I really did enjoy the movie and have enjoyed his earlier creations like Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and the animated Star Wars Clone Wars for years and were pleasantly surprised by Hotel Transylvania. It is a great family film that will become a staple around Halloween for years to come. It is a touching coming of age story that is sweet and fun. Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez do a great job, as do the rest of the voice actors. Kudos to my old teammate on this great movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as my family did.
1400052173|4.0|This book was picked by my book club and I found it an enjoyable and educational read.  I had heard about someone cells being used without their permission and thought it was a myth.
0671891634|5.0|This is almost required reading for a novice investor in stocks.  Peter Lynch was a leading mutual fund manager and he discusses his approaches to buying and selling stock to support the Magelland fund's dominance on wall street during his tenure and the fund manager.  He gives lots of insight and states his &#34;Peter's Principles&#34; that could help keep you on sound investment strategies and help avoid some pitfalls he himself has succumbed too.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I grabbed this app awhile back when it was free and forgot about it. Recently downloaded this app to my kindle and am enjoying it.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|People say it's too confusing and that there's people acting stupid.  I didn't see what they are talking about after seeing the movie.<br /><br />(Spoiler)<br />Only part that drove me off the wall was when the android gave the guy a drink that contained the black liquid.

0385341008|5.0|The populace of the Channel Islands during WWII endured privations and sacrifices unique to their situation and geographical location.  This book was informative in an intensely personal way, through letters to each other.  The inividual personalities of the various characters really come to life using this format.<br /><br />I learned much while simultaneously falling in love with the literary society members.  I also fell in love with the island of Guernsey!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|This is a must have album for Fleetwood Mac fans.........many of the great older hits are here........and ofcourse the<br />incredible Stevie Nicks at her best.  I would buy this just to hear Stevie. I guess my favorites are 'Gypsy' & 'Little Lies',<br />but I like them all.

B007H1HQW0|3.0|This works on regular size bottles but not large ones<br />I called their customer service line to see if it could be modified but no one returned my call<br />I had to return the product<br />Only buy this if you are cutting regular size wine bottle or items of that size
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An excellent read from the ground perspective. Chris Kyle clearly captured the emotions of war and conflict in his personal account of his war experiences. The brutal honesty was refreshing when compared to many PC authors on this subject.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have done several books on it now, and it is wonderful.  I am a retired librarian and it was &#34;different&#34; not to have a &#34;real book&#34;.  But Love the Kindle.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|The strength of love in many different forms is discovered by the main character as we move through the investigation of the tragic fire which has caused a mother and daughter to be hospitalized and near death.  A mother's love is the driving force as we discover arson is just the beginning of the mystery. Well-written and thought-provoking, it's a love story in the midst of a mystery as good as any edge-of-your seat thriller
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like playing it and my son likes watching it be played. I go in it every day and play for a little while
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great graphics, easy to learn, tough to master. Fun to play. Great for when you need a quick stress reliever.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it pretty good. If you like to play hidden object this is the one you need to try.
B003V1WST6|4.0|This book I read to cleanse my palate since I was between books and it did it's job. The best way I can descibe it is a &#34;The Devil wears Prada&#34; meets &#34;Sex and the City,&#34; but in a moderate version.<br /> It starts with the main character having a life changing moment at her best friend's wedding and her world crashing down. She moves to New York to find herself. Instead she finds a new friend who gives her a make over and introduces her to the finest things in life and because of all these changes she ends up meeting two men and blogging about dating them both.<br />The story was well written and entertaining, I just got tired of reading about a certain accessory and how much the main character was in love with it. Also I didn't like the ending, but overall the book was enjoyable.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love this was not sure what it was at first but after the first show i couldn't stop watching it. 2 thumbs up for me can not stop talking about it. This show is great i say watch it for yourself and you will see what i am talking about.

B00BHMETKC|2.0|The only engaging character in this film was the one John Goodman played. Although it was based on a true story, the plot seemed rather disjointed. I wouldn't pay to see this film again.

0151012768|5.0|When the movie was on cable, we really liked it, so we checked on-line to see if there was a book.  We were very satisfied with the book.
B0076DELIG|2.0|This has to be one of Connelly's weakest efforts in story telling. Usually his tales are plausible and he does not leave loose ends. The Black Box starts out reasonably well but deteriorates quickly. Bosch the protagonist connects a thousand different dots and figures out the puzzle. This is where the story loses its credibility. Connelly  uncharacteristically  goes off the main story and writes at length about jazz and his daughter's experience at an electronic shooting range. I skipped over most of chapter 24 and all of 25. These chapters have nothing to do with the main theme. Connelly wants you to know that he is a jazz aficionado. Perhaps Bosch's daughter is going to be the protagonist in Connelly's future books and he is building her character toward that end. I found it annoying to say the least. M.C. also leaves large gaping holes in the story. I can not expand on this without spoiling it for the potential readers. Suffice to say that this story does not stand up to even light scrutiny. I am disappointed and would not recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've had this game for a long time and I love it so much!!!! The cool thing is that you can name take care of and just spend time with your horse.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The movie inspired me to read Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \\"Team of Rivals.\\" The book gives far more detail regarding Lincoln's character, but the movie represents the overall role of Lincoln in one of the most difficult times in our history. Some parts were overdone or overplayed to make a point, but the point was still an honest portrayal of Lincoln's genius and political acumen. Sadly, the hatred in the legislators who couldn't imagine freeing slaves is the same hatred I see in the civil rights anniversary films we are watching this year. And the same hatred towards our black president.

B0043RSK3K|4.0|My only complaint is that towards the end of the books (1980s and on) it starts to become noticeably biased. Facts are used a bit loosely in order to fit the events to an overall narrative theme. Nevertheless, very much worth reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the best temple run game ever I love it so much.I would highly recommend getting this game.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|My wife and I were searching Amazon for a movie to watch.  We stumbled on this movie.  Since we had seen a production in person from this group, we thought that it might be fun to watch.  I am so glad that we decided to watch this movie.  The production is mind blowing.  The scenery and sets are spectacular.  You won't be sorry you chose to watch this production.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Better than any scary movies I've seen.  This show is definitely better viewed on DVD back-to-back than on television, as I think the commercials and week between episodes makes it less terrifying.  Plus, the story line is so complex with each character being intertwined, so watching all the episodes in a period of a week or two will definitely increase your understanding and appreciation for the awesome writing on this show.
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|i respect Bon Jovi for making it 3 deacades despite what i feel is a  Band that is basically known for 2 and a half songs and  they represent that last wave of 80's  Arena rock bands and they know where to target there hype and fans. thing is with Bon Jovi they found a formula that worked a long time ago and have worn it out and re sewed it again and again, however this album while well played musically and Produced to match what they do so well, has no knock out tracks in the loot and it sounds and feels like going through the motions and i'm not madd at them, because they have out lasted a whole lot of acts, however  you alreaady know what to expect from this band and sometimes being so predictable can give the sound and vibe a  Bad Name.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I ever play and I had play many games like this. I would like to congratulates those people who work so hard to make this amazing game.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Classic James Bond once again Daniel Craig proves why he is my favorite Bond. ( Constant action and just fun to watch)
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|My five year old loves to play this game.  He enjoys having to make him complete his dream walking.  The graphics are great.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Disappointing movie had high hopes and they were crushed. Not worth watching even if it was free or you were paid to watch it.
B00942X8PY|5.0|It was a lot of fun and kept me thinking.  My five year old even loves to play it by himself.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The old stand-by solitaire. The easiest and best way to kill some time. Always a comfort tool and very addictive!
B0074QGGK6|3.0|It's okay.  I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're really bored, sitting on an airplane, early in the morning, wired from coffee, and need something to entertain your brain without overloading it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love the app but it keeps messing up. I've already deleted 1 time and downloaded it again. Looks like I'm gonna have to do it again. 3 strikes and it's out.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is an excellent adult movie. The f word is used several times so not real good for kids. A lot of actors from the 70's & 80's are in the movie which makes for an extra treat.
B000EGCITG|1.0|Autorip only downloaded partial songs to iCloud & would not let me download it to my device! What's the point of 24.99 a year if it does not work? Figure it out or give me iCloud money back!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you like fantasy stories.  It is a great escape from life for a little while.  I loved many of the characters in the book but Jace was my favorite.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Truthfully I had hoped that this blu-ray would come with an ultra violet copy since I don't own a blu-ray player. However I have not seen ay sign of an ultra violet for this.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book contains a treasure trove of information. I learned about what hybridization and genetic manipulation has done to some of our foods, wheat particularly. I have a &#34;wheat belly&#34; and have gone on many diets. I lost weight over all, but never more than an inch or so around my middle until now. I feel like I have a new lease on life. I have given up wheat in its entirety. It does present some challenges when planning meals but it can be done with variety. I started out at 230 pounds with a 42+ middle. 5 weeks into this and I've lost 10 pounds. Most if not all of this is around my middle. I am also a diabetic and have been able to maintain proper blood glucose levels without prescription drugs. I am also not going through the roller coaster of every two or so hours eating something because of feeling hungry. This book is a real life changer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You can empathize with the characters in the hunger games much easier than some other similar books. I enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I downloaded this app just to know what was the fuss about, and I am really caught with the game. In the starting levels is easy and fast, but as you go it becomes more challenging and engaging. Definitely recommended for all ages.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Goes along with Sugar Busters.  Lose the wheat and you will see a decrease in high blood sugars.  I didn't believe it until I did it.  I have been a diabetic since 1970 but losing the wheat has lowered my blood sugar to normal levels and I am now taking very little insulin.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|The other books were so easy to fall in love with and I honestly couldn't wait to see what happened with Alex and her mom and Hana. But this book was so below average from what she could have done with the story and how much further she could have taken the story as well. I'm sorry I wasted 10.55 on this lame book. Still love Lena but hated the middle to end.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed this book and look forward to finishing the series.  The idea of not being able to choose whether or not you will be claimed by good or evil is an intriguing spin on the current supernatural trend.  Many of the supporting characters are well fleshed out and interesting.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its sooooooooooo fun I wish it could stop being dumb when I first got it it worked but now its being a buthole
B007TK77QE|5.0|J K has left Harry Potter far behind, and this is no story for the followers of nice (if supernaturally powered) school kids. She does retain the knack of engaging us in this often gritty tale of tension between encroaching urban decay and the last gasp of the English Arcadian ideal. There is much to pity, and little to simpathise with ...<br /><br />Read it first before you hand it on to the kids.
B008I3RARW|2.0|I'm no pro when it comes to racing games. So, when I say it's too easy then it truly is too easy. The only mode that's even minimally entertaining is Timer. However, even in Timer, beating the default best time I could do in my sleep. I only downloaded because it was a free app of the day. Definitely not worth $4.99. The developer is definitely insulting people with this offering.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|A great entertaining read about the confusing word of family and relationships.  The main character really draws you into his world, and you clearly understand the tightrope of sanity that we all walk. It's an easy read, not a lot of emphasis of creative prose.  But all the characters are someone which whom I can relate, and for that reason it is a completely engaging read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great here are update ideas 1 add book and quilts 2 add flint and steel in creative it gets on my nerves sometimes 3 add mine carts<br />mine cart tracks red stone torches and boats 4 add emerald that is all still best game should be the best app in the app store.
0525478817|5.0|All I can say is that the book is just wonderful! i'm glad i got the book and would recommend the book!
B00001OH7O|5.0|Luckily, it was not a god awful small affair. I can now turn and face the strange, a couple of kooks.....you get the idea. A great cd, and a good shopping experience. Thank You
B005OKTPKC|5.0|I have not purchased a kindle Book before. I thought it would be harder. I was amassed at how easy and economical it was. I enjoyed reading the book more this way as I could increase the print, control the contrast and read in bed without disturbing my wife. What I great idea. I am just sorry I didm;t start using it years ago. Gone is the option to buy any printed books in future. As a senior citizen this is a fantastic breakthrough for me. I'm hooked!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I downloaded this book on a Friday evening and could not put it down until finishing Sunday afternoon.  I was compelled to learn Victoria's fate, being torn between heartache and triumph.  It is beautifully written, successfully creating images of the flowers and what they portray.  It was a welcome surprise to find a reference guide in the back with flowers and their \\"meanings.\\"  This reason alone makes me wish I had bought a hardcopy.
B002IVLH60|5.0|Ignore any nah sayers that are posting reviews.  I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but some people posting reviews about this album know nothing about music or pearl jam's history.  This album is more poppy than any PJ album before, but doesn't make it bad, it actually was genius.  I can't find one bad song on this album.  Has some great rockers in the begining and then there's Breathe, which is incredible simple ballad.  Amongst the Waves is one of my favorites as well with it's uplifting theme.  Unthought unknown is another right after with great accompainment of keyboard.  Then comes Supersonic where you want to turn the volume on full.  Could go on and on how great overall this album is, but don't have time.  Whether you like classic PJ or the more recent, this is a great album to listen to front to back.  No fillers or much political ranting on this either, which is another reason this is great. Finally a great album where every song is unique.  Great job PJ!!  Hope the next one is as good as this.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I liked all these books, they had a creative story and well thought out characters.  I didn't love these books but I did like them a lot.  I was a little disappointed with how the series ended however.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|This product came on time and was in good shape.  The viewing quality was good.  Enjoyable movie can't wait for the next movie.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This game can become an obsession, so don't start a new level unless you have time to finish it. I would have given it a higher rating except the mini game to open a new building area was frustrating for me and I had to ask for more time and start it over every time. Good game for eye - hand coordination, though.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Enjoyable movie... looking forward to the next one.  The DVD arrived on time and was in great shape.  Played well.
0525953728|3.0|The first half of No Easy Day gives us no new insight into the world of Special Ops or Seals that you can't find somewhere else. The author refuses to delve into his personal life and only sparingly describes his feelings. Personal accounts of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan can be found in greater detail in American Sniper or Lone Survivor. However, around the half-way mark, No Easy Day takes off as it describes the planning and operations of the UBL raid. It was fascinating.<br /><br />Characters are drawn a bit thin and the writing is somewhat mediocre, which isn't surprising considering how rushed this book was to print. But the telling of the raid itself is riveting. I found the character Jen really interesting and wish we could have learned more about her, but as she is an undercover CIA agent, this wasn't possible.<br /><br />The ending felt a bit incongruent as Owen laments how the identity of Seal Team 6 is leaked very shortly after the mission is completed. He goes on about the dangerous lack of anonymity, refusing to sign a flag for President Obama because he doesn't want his real name to appear, or how upsetting it was to him that the public came to learn it was Devgru that completed the mission. Then he writes a book about all of this and blows the lid even more wide open. I suspect the man is conflicted.<br /><br />However, none of this overshadows the mission to capture or kill BinLaden and how successful it was considering the obstacles they faced at the outset, such as the downed helicopter. The Seals control of force is exemplary. I was certainly left to wonder if our enemies would be as protective of our women and children as Seal Team 6.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone interested in Special Ops memoirs and the fight against terrorism or readers of military history.
B008XCM18Q|1.0|Nothing like the movie, which is good, but the writing style is simply terrible and not fluid.  This read was a waste of time.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Lots of gimmicks, bad facial expressions, gore, and screwed up historical aspects makes for some shockingly bad acting and plot lines. Russel Crowe and Lucy Liu could have done a lot better wth the roles that they had, but they played them like comic book characters. Silver Lion was about the best actor in the bunch and that is NOT saying much.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Love Daniel Craig as James Bond.  Hope to see more of him.  Like the way this one should more of his beginnings and people from his past.<br />If you truly love the Ian Fleming 007 stories this is definitely worth watching at least once.<br />I wish Ian Fleming was able to see how modern technology was able to push his stories into new dimensions!<br />I bet he would have like Craig's character.<br />I am going to have to break down and add this to our movie collection as my husband is a huge fan.
B005H9B44A|3.0|An incredible cast of top rate stars, and still not a good movie!!! Plot was slow to develop and though Thor was one of my favorite comic heros, this movie was NOT very well made or produced. Personal opinion of course, but Loki was lame and there really was NO character interaction that made a lot of sense.
0143118757|5.0|I followed the books advice and it worked.  this is a good book for anyone and is useful for daily life
B00AMBH70S|4.0|An intresting take off of the Bourne franchise, and definately a continuation move by the film makers. The scenery was great, the wolves were NOT at all real in their actions, but all in all an enjoyable movie if you suspend reality for a few hours.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Had a really good expectation on this First Season. Kept on suspection with \\"the walkers\\", good performers, thrilling all the time. We recommend watch this first Season of The Walking Dead and deliver other seasons in order to enjoy familiar times.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The plot makes sense at the end, the tricks and gimmicks work well, John Malkovich is wonderful as a wacky ex-agent and Hellen Mirren is astounding (though her shooting style is a bit far fetched). Found myself laughing out loud at times and enjoyed the entire movie.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game is cool ... I like shooting the scientists with my machine gun jetpack. It's like a joyride to infinity. I only gave it four stars because there should be harder obstacles. I also think the graphics could be a little better. The jetpacks should require fewer coins.
1400052181|5.0|My book club read this book, and we all learned more than we ever thought we would. Not only did we learn some history lessons, but we learned far more about chemistry and medical research than we ever thought we'd want to! =).
B001NLL0RW|4.0|I like these stories because the facts at well researched.  With each book the characters are further refined. A good read that keeps you interested, and if you like puzzles you,'ll enjoy trying to solve it before it is revealed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great game I enjoy it a lot it is much better than temple run awesome .
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Thompson is back with his usual terrific performance.  The extra material is worth the extra money.  Highly recommended.  In my top ten.
B00005R87Q|5.0|you might want to get this movie before Fast and Furious 6 comes out. It made more sense once I saw the earlier movies and had some back story. I get most all my movies used on Amazon and have yet to be disappointed with quality. I got a low quality pirated movie on ebay once, I never went back to ebay again.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|As I mentioned above, the story was a little weird, but the actors were good.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes British films.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|Bruce Lee put everything he had into this movie, but never got to see it on the big screen. If you like martial arts, this movie is the grand daddy of them all in my opinion. No collection is complete without it.
B008220C38|3.0|This movie was not as good as I thought it would be.  The story was weird, however the costumes were very good.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|I'm running out of things to say here. These are all good movies, you must have the complete set. I watch these over again. You'll want to get Terminator salvation though, trust me.
B004I744AS|4.0|i open this app every night to see what new words i can learn through the 'word match' and &#34;word of the day' features.  you can play 'hangman',  learn about historical events and, of course, look up words in the dictionary.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|This is a classic movie, it was in perfect condition and with the drone problem we face today in America, I recommend watching this classic.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this is a wonderful app. can be slow at times ie game play but over all a good game. easy interactive screens and love the code red feature.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|It's a love story actually. The effects are unsettling and I really hate trying to do movie reviews because we all have different opinions on what is good or bad.
0205313426|3.0|i found this book covers many basic grammatical knowledge. It's good, but not super awesome like some reviewers said. Would I recommend to others--maybe
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Any Harry Potter aficionado must have the set, you know. This is one of my two favorites in the series, which I own in it's entirety.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book lived up to its hype!  The book was not predictable as some of these type books can be.  I couldn't put it down and hope another comes out soon that is as interesting.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|With the guy fawkes masks showing up everywhere nowadays, don't you want to know the story behind it? Of course you do. This is a revolutionary video.<br /><br />&#34;The people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of the people&#34;.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I really liked the premise of this book but the book itself turned out to be slower and more boring at times than I would have imagined. The ending was very good, but to get there was a little slower than I would have liked.  Not exactly a page turner but it had some very good sequences.  If the trial had come sooner in the book and maybe the auther had left some surprises for it, that would have made it more interesting and not  feeling so redundant.  Overall, a thought provoking story theme and worth reading.
B001TK80C0|5.0|I'm running out of things to say here. These are all good movies, you must have the complete set. I watch these over again. You'll want to get Terminator salvation though, trust me.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Bought app on a lark, turns out it is a blast to drive around.  Would like easier upgrades, but you cannot have everything.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|I started out with fast five. I liked that one, so I started picking up the earlier movies. They are all good. This one was used but in nearly perfect condition. I've never got an bad used disk from anyone on Amazon, and I've ordered more than a dozen.
B00314VYNE|4.0|nicely done, the quality is quiet good and my goddaughter was very happy with this gift especially because is her favorite movie!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was worthy of the ending of the franchise. I suggest you get both parts and watch them back-to-back.
1616550414|5.0|This is the one Legend of Zelda book that you need in your collection if your a Zelda fan. It is very detailed and the pictures are just great, it makes you want to replay all of these games again.
B005LAII12|5.0|By no means a masterpiece this crazy flick gets a five star review from me for one reason and that reason is FLASH!!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000PMGS8G Flash Gordon: Saviour of the Universe Edition]]
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I didn't watch the whole thing, so i probably can't give it a reliable review. Maybe ill do better next time
B00785P2QC|5.0|U like that it give y so much mire thing to do I have started this over and over again and I still like it . I have so much fun I love this game and games like this
B002W1UEW4|4.0|This was a classic 1st movie in a series. Had to focus on background to introduce the plot, and came out just above average. It's not one to get super excited about, but exciting enough. Overall decent rental and entertainment.

B004EFYZ1C|3.0|Enjoy the graphics. Keeps you informed. Nice to refer to. Would like more info on how to put it to good use.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I wish I read this before knowing about vampires, Dracula, etc.  What a shock this would've been!  I can only imagine how scary this must've been.  It just eats at the taboo of seduction during that era.  Highly recommend this book.  The only sad thing is that we're inundated with Dracula, so the shock and surprise are gone.  Best scene is Lucy in the graveyard.  I wish movies would've capitalized on that.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|By far my  most  favorite game.  I reAlly enjoy  everything about it,, music, graphics, choices. I  play every day, great.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Sofia The First: Once Upon A Princess is a Disney DVD of the pilot for the Disney Channel/Disney Junior original series that introduces the newest member of the Disney Princess group, Princess Sofia. With an all-star voice cast including Ariel Winter, veteran voice actress Tress MacNielle(Tiny Toons), Sara Ramirez(Grey's Anatomy), Jess Harnell(Drawn Together), Wayne Brady(Let's Make A Deal), and TV personality Tim Gunn(Project Runway), Sofia The First tells the tale of a young girl named Sofia, who became a princess after her widowed mother marries the King, a widower himself, and Sofia and her mother, Miranda, are crowned Queen and Princess. However, life as a royal will not be easy for Sofia, as she is given the cold sholuder for her step-siblings and she is being coerced by a evil and goofy sorcerer named Cedric. So Sofia is going to the Royal Prepatory Academy run by the main headmistresses, The Good Fairies(Yes, the same fairies from the 1959 Disney classic Sleeping Beauty)and teaches Sofia all about being a good princess and being good to all.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome..! I have it on my kindle fire hd and I am addicted to this game!In my opinion,if you download this game you won't be disappointed (:

B0086700CM|5.0|i liked everything about this game n above all it has no violence in it... in other words its clean n fun
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|As an owner of several HP12Cs over the past 15 years, I have a good perspective on the 12C and its usefulness.  The original version which I have from the late 1990s was made in Malaysia and has great tactile feedback and build quality. The next version from around 2001 was when HP moved its calculator production to China and subcontracted to Kinpo Electronics.  The 2001 version, while still functional, has keys that rattle worse than a Mexican maracas.  I subsequently purchased the 2nd version of the HP 12C Platinum around 2006 and it was a vast improvement in quality and much faster; key feedback is very good (also made by Kinpo).  The latest version (Platinum) from late 2012 is even better with very good key feel and overall key quality. Interestingly, the newest HP 12C Platinum is a tad bid slower than the current regular HP12C with the newest processor; however, the Platinum version is made by Kinpo while the regular 12C is now made by another subcontractor (Invartec) and has inferior tactile key quality and feel (note:  all Kinpo made HPs begin with the serial# code: CNA while all Invartec begin with CY).  Why the latest HP Platinum does not have the ARM processor from the regular 12C is beyond me. Also, why is there no printed manual?  Come on HP, it can't cost more than a buck to get it printed in China.  In summary, the 12C is an iconic product which has a great range of useful features and applications.  Too bad HP can't keep the manufacturing consistent.  Perhaps time to bring manufacturing back in house and to the USA?
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great story, captivating characters. A bit many characters to keep track of in my mind but it's still a page turner that draws you in and won't let go. But read The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo first or it won't make much sense.
B00000DHRX|4.0|I like the Best of George Michael cd , but I can't say I love it. There are 2 cds & I like the one cd better than the other.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Warning! Major spoiler!<br />Very entertaining read, except, well, the part that Winterfell was sacked and burned. No, there is nothing wrong with it, I just don't like it. I love Winterfell so pardon me.
B004Q3UL56|5.0|Love this movie! I was a little shocked at Anne Hathaway's performance. She was amazing but never imagined her going so bold and showing nudity. Gyllengaal's performance was great and believable.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We love the film, and wanted to have the 3D version for home use (we have a 3D television).  Outstanding!  By the way, for what its worth as you consider this, I am in my 70's.
B00B23O96A|5.0|As a long time Clapton fan I had to buy his new album as soon as it came out. It is a unique album. It is a little different from the style I'm normally use to with Claptons music, But this album is amazing. All Eric clapton fans must own this. You will not be disappointed.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|This movie is a great action movie. Really brings out the best of  Nick Cage. The quality was very good and playback was smooth.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Rio is a colorful, funny, good music, and great story line. A treat for your senses. Kids and adults will love it.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really loved how it showed the inside workings of a castle for the era.<br />Love the accents, the clothes, all the fine manners.<br />I would love to have had captions, somtimes it was hard to follow.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book is the best of its kind.  I would recommend it to any Percy Jackson fan.  The book is a definite best seller
1616550414|5.0|Truth be told, I have only played two Zelda games, After reading the Historia, however, it has inspired me to seek out the games that I've missed and play those as well. The book has full color pages with fantastic insight into the series, sketches, early concept designs and details you might have missed about the characters. It certainly is a must-have for any Zelda fan.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to like? Great story, great cast, and great acting. Julian Fellows knows his subject matter and I have been a fan of his for quite a while.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The game is so engaging it is hard to put down. It is colorful, challenging, and FUN. I recommend it for all.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It is so sad that Jaycee had to endure so many years of torture.  It is so sad that there are crazy people like Phillip and his equally crazy wife allowed to roam free and ruin the lives of good people.  The police missed many opportunities to find Jaycee, but they blew it.  Phillip was allowed to live his life in the way he wanted even though he was previously convicted of child molestation.  Where was law enforcement when they were so desperately needed?
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|This is the last one i read. Wasted money and time. This is me filling the required word count. One more.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Easily one of the 3 best movies I saw in 2012.<br /><br />Don't recommend this movie to anyone who liked On Golden Pond.
B006RXQBUC|1.0|I have viewed many Instant Primve Videos, but the quality of this movie was so bad it almost felt like a copy.  I am going to request a refund.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Not a mystery as to why this movie brought in over $1.5 billion at the box office.<br /><br />Marvel studios has it going!!
B00B23O96A|2.0|I give it 2 stars. I love EC , own pretty much everything (apart from those super-deluxe-versions coming out recently for couple of hundred of bucks) Seen him live 17 times all over the world and by all means appreciate any artist who tries out new areas. Does the Album grow on you, it does -but in the wrong direction- I try over and over again and now i can only listen 5 mins to it (15 in the beginning).  I DO NOT COMPARE TO ANY OTHER ALBUMS , EC is a great artist, I expect him to try out new directions, but this one just does not work (and I am sure, Gary Moore will forgive him ;)
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is great! I opened this account when pinterest first started but never really used it. Once I got my kindle I got the app and its so easy to use. Very helpful.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Challenging and enjoyable.  It is one of the few games I've downloaded that I actually play.  Playrix did well with this game.
0545265355|5.0|I bought these as a gift - read the books - you have to read it!  The movie that has come out is great, too, and the books are even better.  I recommend The Hunger Games to all!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|this game is very addicting.  will have to have power cord handy. cant put it down.  great graphics and has many changes on the matching parts.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|We own another Bruder dump truck, great times with my grandchildren (2.5 yrs old).  They love to move them around, I love the detail and imaginary play.  We'll worth it.
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|The short is pretty good for a low budget production, it could have been made better by a longer Covenant presence and battle between ODST and the invading Covenant forces and less about the cadet with mother issues but as a featurette it works well.<br /><br />How they combined Halo 4 game footage with the movie was inspired and works well to link Forward unto Dawn with Halo 4 and explain why the commander of Infinity is listening so closely to the emergency broadcast that Cortana is sending out.<br /><br />Now we just need Microsoft to get a real full length Halo movie made.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Needed a calculator on my kindle fire HD and this one is perfect. Has everything I need and works great!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is an amazing game. It expands you learning of the dinosaurs. It is fun because when I was a little kid my grandmother and cousins would sit around and watch all of the Jurrasic Park movies as a family so it brings back some of my good memories of nmy childhood.
B00068TJM6|5.0|My wife bought this watch on Amazon. We live in New Zealand. I like quality and very fussy about my watches. I have an top of the range Olympic which I would rate with the best. The Seiko that she bought for me is awesome. High quality for a reasonable price, which is perfect for my sport and training. I have another watches for every day use, well worn. I would recommend this watch highly to all, if you want practicality, performance and good looking watch!. A excellent performer.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Though this movie did have several funny moments, overall it was offensive, childish, and pointless.  I felt like I'd wasted a couple hours of my life and needed to take a shower afterward to wash off the filth and stupidity.
B00340ESIS|4.0|I can't give it 5 stars unless I sell a script someday, but I've always appreciated the recommendations from this book.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|enjoy the game and it is easy toplay<br /><br />I really enjoy the game and find it addicting. it is easy to lose track of time with it. like the autoplay.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Slow start. I couldn't put this book down once I got into it. The last bit leads you to further investigation. Read it!
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|Years from now people will be sitting in a coffee shop talking about this album as if it were just recently released.  This is a classic.  As a musician I love everything about it!  Now go and buy the album!
B004SBX112|2.0|I don't want to give that many permissions to a game. something smells fishy.<br /><br />I guess I wont be getting any more levels to play.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not a book reader. Saw the first movie and decided to read the series only so I could know what happened. The books have been so much fun to read!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I like Star Trek and will always be a big fan of the movies they made. This set make it easy for me to watch them all again and have backups to the ones that are on dvd. Just wish the had the digital copy to go with them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the most best game I have played. The first best horse game I played. I'm McKinney I love this game so much I play it every day. Horses are my favorite animal . I ride them to. The horse is fast as a dog. I wonder if  someone will fell the same.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this for my aunt thinking she had the HD Kindle. Well.. I was wrong. This is a really nice case and the craftsmanship is very nice but the regular kindle just swims in it and doesn't fit. Just be sure you have the HD Kindle and this will do nicely.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|OMG!!!! The first time I played this game I was hooked. I haven&#34;t been to bed on time since. It is sooooo addicting I just want to play all the time. I really have to control myself and remember I have other things to do like go to work and bed. Everyone need to downlload this app.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|A friend told me about this book and I was a little skeptical about it, but it's hilarious and a really great read.

B000BGH2CM|4.0|Wrestlemania 20: Where it all begins again, on March 14,2004 you had the dead man return, former drug addict beat a olympic gold medalist and a man's life long dream come true.<br /><br />We start off with a promo with all of the main eventers and two rising stars( Randy Orton and John Cena) talking to themselves in a empty room about wrestlemania. It did get me pumped for the event and even had a little comedy with Vince, Shane and baby McMahon standing together in a dark room with the tagline being said.<br /><br />John Cena vs. The United states champion The Big Show<br />John Cena comes at first and gets a huge pop from the MSG crowd, the ironic thing about this is that a few years later he gets the most heat every night they are in MSG but anyways he cuts a promo making fun of The big Show and the crowd loves every joke he says. The Big Show then comes out he looks pretty pissed by John Cena's words. The Big Show dominates Cena for most of the match, Cnea gets some offense and is able to get the F-U but the Big Show breaks out, Cena becomes frustrated and gets his chain so he can hit The Big Show, the ref stops him and as the ref was getting rid of the chain, Cena gets brass knucks and hits The big Show and gives him another F-U for the 1-2-3. Good way to show off both talent and the right guy went over<br /><br />Then we get a promo where Eric Bischoff sends John Coachman to find the Undertaker and make sure he Undertaker does not beat Kane since he is from smackdown. This promo was a waste of time, it made no sense if Bischoff wanted to stop The Undertaker why would he send the jobber known as The Coach ? The next promo stars evolution. IT was a good promo for Randy Orton but it was a little too long for this show, it was more like a video package for Rock 'n' Sock connection vs. evolution.<br /><br />Fatal four way for the world tag team championship<br />Dudley boys vs. La Resistance vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. THe world tag-team champions Booker-T& Rob Van Dam<br />This match was pretty slow and for a fatal four way, I think they could have had bigger stars than Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak, even though they did a good job, the match was very short, the finish was well down with Booker- T and RVD both hitting their signatures on Rob Conway for the 1-2-3<br /><br />Next is a promo where that idiot Coach continues to look for The Undertaker, instead he finds four legends having a good time in a closet. I won't give their names but one of them did give birth to a hand.<br /><br />Christian vs. Chris Jericho<br />A very good wrestling match with little error. Jericho played a aggressive role since he wanted to avenge Trish Stratus; it would of made more sense if the match was more of a brawl type but these two are not the best of brawlers so that might of made the match into crap. This match ends with Trish coming to the aid of Jericho, Christian tries to attack her but Jericho saves her but by mistake she elbows Jericho and Christian capitalizes with the roll-up and gets the roll-up. AFter that Trish then turns on Jericho. Great heel turn, Great to see Christian in his first serious singles match at wrestlemania, but it's a shame to see Jericho loss at mania for the third time in a row<br /><br />2 on 3 handicap match<br />Evolution vs Rock 'n' sock connection<br />This match showcased everyone's talent and ability. It was cool to see a star from the 80's teamed with 2 stars of the 2000's vs two stars of the 90's. Mick Foley showed he had no ring rust. The Rock and Ric Flair's can you top that competition was quite entertaining. Randy Orton hitting the RKO on Foley and getting the win for the team was the right thing to do.<br /><br />First Ever Play boy evening gown match<br />Stacey Keibler & Miss Jackie vs Torrie Wilson & Sable<br />There wasn't much wrestling in this match but Stacey Keibler looked HOT in pink bra and panties. Torrie Wilson's body was nice but her face looked messed up and I don't really care about Sable and Miss Jackie. Yes this match did not belong on the show but I did not mind it all due to Stacy Keibler<br /><br />First Ever WWE Cruiserweight Championship open<br />Chavo Guerrero vs. Jamie Noble vs.Funaki vs.Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Nunzio vs. Tajiri vs. Shannon Moore vs. Billy Kidman<br />This match had too many people in it, it should of been a fatal four way at most. BUt Billy KIdman had a awesome spot. A guy would do two moves and the other got out, and went on for that until Rey went against and Chavo; it lasted for 3 moves and Rey was robbed at wrestlemania again.<br /><br />Goldberg vs Brock Lesner<br />This was the one of the \\"big four matches\\" that wrestlemania always has and had great build-up and it sucked; No it was worst than \\"sucked\\" it was crap between Wrestling heroes and December to dismember. They sat around forever starring at each other just to piss off the fans that were booing them due to the fact that they were leaving for B.S reasons. There was barely any selling in this match and every moved looked forced. Even if one of these two are your favorite wrestlers, it's still won't be fun to watch.<br /><br />Fatal 4 way for the WWE Tag Team Championship<br />WWE Tag Team Champions Scotty to Hotty & Rikishi vs APA vs. Basham Brothers vs. World's Greatest Tags teams<br />This match was a little quicker and unlike the last fatal four way, it was four real teams going at it.<br /><br />Women's Championship match<br />Women's Champion Victoria vs Molly Holly<br />With two good wrestlers you thought it would've been a good match but it wasn't at all. The only entertaining to happen was that Jerry \\"The KIng\\" Lawler mentioned MOlly Holly wearing gammy panties. I do believe that Molly regrets cutting her hair for this boring, unmemorable match.<br /><br />WWE Championship Match<br />WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle<br />After a underdog win by Eddie Guerrero to win the wwe championship, it was the right thing to goagainst Kurt Angle. The build-up was awesome and gave Angle plenty of heat and Eddie getting every fan behind him. Every time ANgle put Eddie in the ankle lock, you had the feeling he was going to tap but he didn't and finally Eddie was able to trick Angle into taking Eddie's shoe off and get him in the small package to retain his title.<br /><br />Kane vs. The Undertaker<br />After much wait; The Undertaker finally returns to get revenge on his brother for burying him alive, how can the match fail? Well that's what happened, it wasn't Kane or The undertaker's fault, it was the booking. Kane acted like a little girl against Taker and it only went on for nine minutes. Yes months of build up for a nine minute match.<br /><br />Triple Treat for the World Heavyweight championship<br />invisable man vs. Shawn Michaels vs. World Heayweight champion Triple H<br />This match is in my top 5 favorites, there was blood, there was false finishes, there was emotion, it had it everything that makes a 5 star match. Triple H tapping out after years of winning was priceless. Invisable man going through the table was a awesome spot. This was the right way to in the 20th wrestlemania<br /><br />My closing thoughts on the show: Only two out of 4 of the \\"big four matches\\" delivered however they were great unforgettable matches that helped the show a lot. Besides the mid card titles matches, all of the raw matches were good to great. Besides the WWE championship match, all of the smackdown matches were forgettable. The commentators did well. The 5th match to the 9th match, was a boring time of the show that dragged on for far to long, but the other matches made you forgive the show for those dull matches<br /><br />Overall I give Wrestlemania 20 a show percentage of 51%<br /><br />Overall I give Wrestlemania 20
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is a great one and I find it very fun to take care of your own horse feed it, groom it, and enter the horse in second competitions.d
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun.  Not like a the old virtual pets that you have to care of hourly.  So easy to enjoy when I have time.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love this game!!!<br /><br />You have to try it. I have been playing it for about four weeks now.  It rocks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My nine year old son loves it and so do I! Highly addictive and fast paced. A great time waster.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie I thought the plot was good.  Bruce Willis and Joesph Gordon- Hewitt did a great job they are both very accomplished actors.  The quality of the movie was not very good. I had it streamed to my tv and any other movies we have gotten this way have been clear, this one was not.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I like the fact that once I completed the game, I could go back and replay levels where I only earned one star and could challenge myself to do better without the pressure.  (p.s. to the designers of the game -- are Geishas really known for &#34;signing&#34;?  Spell check!)  Still, FIVE stars for the fun.  :)
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I like good app if you don't expect your tablet to light only screen does what it says<br />. ..
B008I3RARW|1.0|It works.  That's the best thing I can say about this app. Game play is horrible. Not even good for free,  let alone the 5 bucks they were trying to sell this for!
B007EECSFA|5.0|She has never let me down!  I've read all of her books so far, and her ability to tell a story amazes me every time.  Family mystery, interesting characters, surprise ending-I couldn't put it down!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|It's fun, but an \\"in-app purchase\\"?  My son earned the money to buy his kindle.  Now he earns money to buy certain apps.  He works very hard and spends his money carefully, and was very disappointed to see \\"unlocking\\" a part of the game would cost more.  This is a pathetic marketing ploy trying to take advantage of kids like mine.  Very disappointing to see them stoop this low.
0307352153|5.0|I very much appreciate this book. It made me see that, while I am even more introverted than some of the people in this book, I should never feel bad about being me. Ms. Cain has opened my eyes and made me realize how important my views and ideas are even if people won't stop talking long enough to hear what I have to say. The content of this book has also validated some things that I have always thought about how society feels about introverts while also making me more patient with extroverts. Many extroverted people that I have met are abrasive and I avoid them at all cost, but this book helped me see that it may just be their way of communicating and not to take it personally. I typically do not read this kind of book (I read fantasy), but this book was so interesting and well-written that I look forward to reading more books by this author if the topics interest me. My only complaint about this book is that some of the \\"scientific\\" studies are glossed over and I can't be sure that the author is always coming to the most logical conclusion or that the studies aren't fatally flawed therefore negating any conclusions reached from them. Regardless, this book has helped me to feel more confident and less apologetic about being me :)
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This is a typical Bond movie, if you like Bond you'll like this.<br /><br />This is for filler of seven words
B00003CX9E|5.0|About \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941).....<br /><br />Orson Welles was famously a self-promoter and opportunist of high skills and great gifts, and the widely accepted reputation of his movie \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) as \\"the greatest movie ever made\\" is due at least in part to his drum-beating, showmanship efforts over the decades to give the movie that label.<br /><br />In fact, \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) is a tabloid type celebrity scandal story worthy of \\"The National Inquirer\\" tabloid newspaper and/or scandal magazine (the publication appeared in both forms over the many profitable decades it operated).<br /><br />William Randolph Hearst (in the not too well disguised fictional persona of \\"Charles Foster Kane\\") is taken to task for having a pretty blonde unmarried ex-chorus girl mistress (Marion Davies named \\"Susan Alexander\\" in the movie), for living a life of profligate extravagance obviously both immoral and ridiculous, and for getting away with it all.....for living a life into advanced old age where he passes away, finally, in the care of uniformed nurses on duty at one of his mansions certainly as big as one of the Pope's summer palaces or any of French King Louis XIV's residential retreats.<br /><br />In short, \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) \\"dishes the dirt\\" and wades through sleeze, sleeze, sleeze, all sanitized by the fact the sleeze is perpetrated by a person of wealth and power, a captain of industry of the sort demonized widely and often in the 1941 world then very much in love with Socialism and the philosophy of \\"sharing the wealth,\\" meaning robbing the rich and spreading assets of rich around for the \\"poor\\" to share and enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Rich bad guys\\" were very much in vogue in pre-WWII 1941 in the USA as targets for politicians and the media (the \\"New Deal\\" and Huey Long's \\"Share The Wealth\\" hustles were two of many examples of the times.....Upton Sinclair's California \\"EPIC\\"....an initialism standing for \\"End Poverty In California\\" was yet another of fame in the 1930's...).<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) was a movie about a bad USA rich guy....tabloid stuff for sure.<br /><br />It was presented using tried and true 1920's German art movie techniques of proved value...extreme close-ups, distorted angles, unusual and rarely used techniques of framing and scene changes.<br /><br />\\"The Third Man\\" (1949) is the other movie of fame and honor Orson Welles made while still a handsome young man (middle 30's in 1949), and it also used eccentric and honored German art film techniques to portray post WWII Vienna, Austria as the dark world of \\"Harry Lime,\\" the villain (another villain) Welles portrayed in \\"The Third Man\\" (1949).....<br /><br />BTW, Welles was \\"the third man\\" referred to in the movie title, even though he was not officially given status as first billed movie star in \\"The Third Man\\" (1949)....Joseph Cotton was the \\"official\\" head movie star in that movie.<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) became a media event due to the efforts of Orson Welles to make it so, and his efforts continued decades after \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) was released, and quickly forgotten by most people.<br /><br />The retrospective (and in ways probably revisionist) history about the movie details....over the decades following 1941...tales of Louis B. Mayer offering almost one million dollars to burn the original negative before the movie is released, tales of the \\"battle\\" between then 76 year old Hearst and then 25 year old Welles, and blow-by-blow tales of how the movie \\"almost never made it to the theaters\\" and was \\"disappeared\\" after a brief release...<br /><br />Welles became a movie star starting with \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941), married Rita Hayworth, and was a mainstream Hollywood \\"player\\" during the 1940's and 1950's until his bad health and old age arrived early ended a not bad 20 year career in movies during which he was seen often on USA and world movie house screens.<br /><br />He even became a player in the world of television, which displaced Hollywood movies by 1960.......who can forget the Orson Welles \\"Paul Masson Wine\\" TV ads promising the world that Masson wines would never reach wine customers \\"before it's time\\"? \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.<br /><br />It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.<br /><br />10 stars for \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) for it's place in \\"the big picture\\"......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple.<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) was never \\"pure and simple.\\"<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG-AFTRA accredited movie actor, movie scholar and movie history teacher, and movie reviewer.<br /><br />See details about Tex (David) Allen on the IMDb website.od movies by 1960.......who can forget the Orson Welles \\"Paul Masson Wine\\" TV ads promising the world that Masson wines would never reach wine customers \\"before it's time\\"? \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.<br /><br />It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.<br /><br />10 stars for \\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) for it's place in \\"the big picture\\"......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple.<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane\\" (1941) was never \\"pure and simple.\\"<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG-AFTRA accredited movie actor, movie scholar and movie history teacher, and movie reviewer.<br /><br />See details about Tex (David) Allen on the IMDb website.

B00BESM14U|5.0|The movie was great but not as amazing as the book. I gave it five stars because of how much I loved the book and the characters. It was nice to see the characters come to life though and see the differences between the two. I didn't like how the movie changed the ending because it made the movie seem so typical since he ended up with the girl but it was still a great movie. :)

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|How the producers and writers make a show about paperwork so darn interesting is the greatest mystery of the 21st century.  If someone doesn't watch the show, it is very difficult to explain why I like it.  Seriously, how many shows can make 45 minutes of missing &#34;dress shirts&#34; interesting ... really? The Bates character is masterful.  He is the glue to the show.  I can deal with all the other characters departing over the show's life, but if Bates should leave, so shall I!

B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|I do like Valentine's Day, So She, Feel Like You're Going to Die.  But the rest of the album is all pretty blah.  The songs all run together and sound the same.  And there is not enough vocal melody to make up for the fact that the instrumentation really doesn't vary much from song to song.  2.5 stars at best and most of that is for at least getting back to recording after 10 years.  I'll Take You There is a decent song as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great !but one thing  with the jetpacks they go  guick it should be longer than that.and that is a problem.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Amazing book.  I'll admit I was hooked from the beginning with the pitch perfect rendition of official announcements piped into the homes of North Korean citizens.  And for me, it was a page turner --  jaw-dropping realities, characters I cared about and suspense.  It's also very funny.  Small caveat -- there are sections that might be a bit gruesome for certain readers, but they are never gratuitous.  It's the best book I've read in a long time.

B00B23O96A|5.0|I have been a fan of EC since the early 80's. Music and musicians have changed a LOT since then. I wittnessed the first hour of MTV, yes it used to be 24 hours of non-stop music, then VH1. From wax to cassettes to cd's and now digital music. EC's music has been moving towards its blues roots, mellow jams, and heartfelt songs. Back when he did Pilgrim I remember him taking shots and when he teamed up with BB he took more.<br /><br />Give the guy a break, he's making the music he loves and sure I'd love to get an all rock 'n riff offering from him in the near future but you have to embrace the evolution of EC. If you cant then just walk away...he's not going to do stuff he does not want to. He's earned that right, has a s***load of money and that gives a person creative freedom.  Hell he could probably to 4-5 cd's of just cats screaming before it would affect his standing to any degree.<br /><br />My opinion is that this offering is pretty good, it is more mellow but original. I've listened to it three times today and will stew over it a bit more before I comment on any particular tracks.

B007TNQ7EY|3.0|This game has so many glitches and its main problem when you get on bikes or act's they dont go anywhere not worth the money its really not
B0089J270U|3.0|If one is looking for a demo of some sort of a CinemaScope feature it is either this movie or How To Marry a Millionaire, both part of the Marilyn Monroe myth collection.<br /><br />How to Marry is way better than this. This picture relies entirely on M-G-M musicals to catch its audience but if falls short of just being another copy.<br /><br />It is interesting from a collector's or film scholar point of view, nevertheless. And this is ultimately the reason why I got my copy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|5 stars and loved the book. Already read them previously and loved getting all three books on my kindle at once. Great price too.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|This movie is sooooo awesome. Almadovar keeps you guessing till the very end. One of my favorite of his movies.
0765325950|5.0|every bit what was expected and so long waited for, glad it is finally here. I'm just sorry the author is no longer with us, but very happy that the saga he started is concluded
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Not what we expected, but refreshing and powerful. This is an inspiring film that teaches many life lessons. A great film to watch with family.
B007EDCWHA|3.0|Directioners will want to have this in their personal library! Facts about all the guys Leading up yo their X Factor auditions and beyond! Plus, a few things girls in love with any of the guys would want to know
B000W668R6|4.0|great, for my son for Christmas so I'm sure he will like it, has talked about owning the saga many times
B004E9T0HW|4.0|The story continues from Old Mans War and The Ghost Brigades and proceeds in the same gripping story style. The finale is quite Feel Good.<br /><br />But I seriously find some characters still under developed. Jane Sagan/Perry being the most under developed one.<br /><br />Also Aliens are not really described physically. Not that it takes anything away from the story but if we really are talking about 1000 + species compatible to Humans in breathing oxygen/nitrogen combination, how could there be so much biodiversity? Strikes you as being a bit far fetched.<br /><br />But then that is science fiction...
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Wonderful.  The characters, on the whole, were very likeable. The ones that were not really were not.  My heart went out to Eliza and Nell.  I wish the circumstances could have been different for them but then there'd be no story.  KATE Morton always leaves me fulfilled when I finish one of her books.  Can't wait to read another one.
B004JXXKWY|5.0|Just finished today - and what a masterwork. Easily the best explanation of the GFC I have read - as it helps explain the human side - such as why the people in the market did what they did
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The author pulls you in and makes you care too much about the characters  Wonderfully heart wrenching and not a false note in the book
B005PR44XC|5.0|Michael Lewis rarely disappoints, and has not done this time. The discussion of the Germans? well, just read it...you will be surprised
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Have this on my computer and so really wanted it on the kindle fire also.  My husband is always checking the weather and compares it to other parts of the country.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I read this book for one of my book clubs.  It gave me a feeeling for what happens to so may foster children and why, and I learned a lot about flowers and how they can influence people in many ways.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Great story and love the characters! This is a series that has a character who is such a goof, but a good kind of goof.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I like it and it worked as described but I had Google Chrome and I think somehow it interfered or changed it. I had to delete Google Chrome and can't run it on my main computer now. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Read the book about a year ago and was very intrigued with the level of personal detail and experiences conveyed.  The movie, while somewhat more condensed than the book, helped put imagery to the entire experience.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read all three books of The Hunger Games Trilogy twice and absolutely LOVED them! I disagree with many reviews because I thought all the books were equally good, with the exception of Mockingjay. I thought it was the best. I wouldn't say there's necessarily an age that you should be to read these books, I mean c'mon I was 12 the first time I read the books. As long as you know what's real and what isn't real you are fine. As for all you overprotective parents, well you can't shield your kids from the world forever. The last thing I have to say is these books were well written and the plot twist were great. There was one thing I didn't like though, what happened to Gale in District Two? Suzanne Collins, you should really continue the series so we know what happens to everyone else.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a huge improvement on the first. First, some of the new elements such as gems are nice additions. In addition, the change in scenery are very well done. Great game.
0425264351|3.0|I thought I would like to start new mystery series, saw the Jack Reacher movie advertised and bought the first 4 Jack Reacher novels.<br />I hope the books and story lines get better as Lee Child develops this character-I've read better plots but again I've read worst. It was a little slow in getting anywhere and took way too many pages.<br />The book quality was good-it was the longer and thinner design.  I would rather hold, read and pay for this shape of book than the &#34;regular&#34; smaller size books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love Zombies, own almost every zombie film ever made. Loved the comic, love the show. A must have for every horror fanatic, like me.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Would have rated 5 stars but I set this game down for 3 minutes to make toast and when I came back to it, the whole game reset. I was on the tiger shark and it put me back on level 1 reef shark! I had a 15 minutes survival time and at least 20 gems and now I'm back to the beginning. VERY angry. Until this gets fixed, 1 star for a very disappointing game.

031620157X|5.0|My son's teacher was reading this to the kids and my son just fell in love with it. HAD TO HAVE IT. He said it was funny, scary, suspenseful, crazy... exciting... everything in one book. He begged and pleaded with me to buy it. Everywhere else it was 20 buck... Amazon?? 13! Can't beat that. It was one of my son's birthday presents (he just turned 9) and he hasn't put it down and everywhere he goes, the book goes!
B00846WWVM|4.0|Pro: This is an excellent game, one of the best physics based games I have encountered.<br /><br />Con: As so many reviewers have pointed out,the control for the nozzle direction should be more responsive.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if the game was timed or not. I finally figured it out. Sprinkle is not timed. When one of the little houses burns down, the level will start over.<br /><br />While Sprinkle is a lot of fun, it also is much too difficult for the average player. There are 6 worlds with 12 levels each. A total of 36 drops of water are required in order to advance to the next world. After the first two worlds, it is quite difficult to gain enough drops. For me, it's beginning to look like 2 worlds or 1/3 of the game will be inaccessible. And that's a shame. An unfinished game leaves me with a sense of frustration rather than accomplishment. 1 star deducted for the difficulty.<br /><br />If you like physics based games and are a better than average player, get Sprinkle. If not, think about it.

I someone has issues with the bottle not cutting, it is not with this bottle cutter but with what you do after you've used this to score the bottle.

1416972242|4.0|I am a 39 year old woman and I saw the preview for the upcoming movie City of Bones and thought it looked amazing and at the end of the preview it said based on the books. I actually bought the box set (not through Amazon) as a gift for a friend and she had already read the first one of the series. She told me I HAD to read it and gave me the first book, City of Bones. Even though I did not care for the ending in City of Bones (book one) it did leave me wondering what happened to the characters. I, myself, felt that I HAD to read City of Ashes (book two)! So I ordered it through Amazon and took advantage of the free shipping and used the points I had earned from my Amazon credit card.  It is so well written that I feel like I have already<br />watched the movie!<br /> The only thing kind of negative is that the book,at times,is a little immature. I say \\"kind of\\" because the main characters ARE young kids so, to me, it makes sense that they would say or react to things in that way and it pulled me deeper into the world...I even rolled my eyes at some of the things the characters said much the way I have done to my own 13 year old daughter while overhearing conversation between her and her friends:-) I,personally, found it comical,however, others might find it more fitting for tweens or teens.<br /> Also for the men out there...my boyfriend read both books and enjoyed them as well!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed the opening & how the title implied with Travis or Abby was the disaster! I will read this again.

B002RVCD0U|1.0|\\"Terminator Salvation\\" was an experience similar to watching a 3D movie without the glasses. It tries it's best to make it's action interactive and exciting to the audience, but only succeeds in coming off as a dull special-effects montage. It's a flat, by-the-books action film, void of any originality or credibility, successful only because it bears the name of one of the greatest action franchises of all time.<br /><br />The first two Terminator films (1984's \\"The Terminator\\" and 1991's \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\") are films that will forever be regarded as classics in the genres of action and sci-fi. They combine their thrilling scenes of action with well-developed characters, clear and innovative plots, and the perfect amount of comic relief. The third Terminator film, released in 2003, was a rehash of Terminator 2 that failed to win the hearts of the fans, but is still considered to be a decent action film.<br /><br />Now, in Terminator: Salvation, we're shown the aftermath of an apocalyptic future of mankind, where the humans are fighting an un-winnable war against deadly machines controlled by a super-computer called Skynet. John Connor (Bale), the future leader of the human resistance, hasn't quite reached his full potential by the beginning of Salvation; he's still trying to figure out if the future's inevitable, or if it can be changed for the better. Geez, you'd think he'd have figured it by now!<br /><br />The film takes a further nosedive with the addition of a new Terminator, who in this movie is actually the first Terminator ever made. This particular Terminator has a unique twist; for some bizarre and unexplainable reason, he still thinks he's a human. Sounds exciting right? Well, it had the potential to be, but unfortunately the film goes nowhere with it. Instead, they decide to ham fist an utterly ridiculous fan service into the plot by having the new Terminator meet up with Kyle Reese.<br /><br />For those who are unaware (believe me, I get confused myself), Kyle Reese was the hero of the first movie who happens to be John Connor's father, making him a major target during Salvation's time. Reese is completely oblivious to his importance to the resistance and manages to get himself involved with Terminators yet again. Who does this guy think he is, John Mclaine?<br /><br />A coincidence of this nature is the mark of a lazy writer, and the writers of Terminator Salvation were clearly lazy about their work. Almost every piece of information given in this film contradicts with information given in any of the previous films. One could spend hours trying to figure out what Skynet knows, what it doesn't know, or what the characters know. They could even, god forbid, try and figure out what the hell is going on, but no matter how hard they think, they'll come to the same conclusion every time: none of it makes any sense.<br /><br />The Terminator series was never meant to be continued after Terminator 2, it wrapped the plot up nice and tight, but the introduction of T3 turned the whole universe upside down, and now, everything about the film is so complex and confusing that it's not even worth trying to figure out.<br /><br />The writers obviously want us to ignore the various plot holes, to ignore the silly and unrealistic motivations of the characters, and to ignore the terrible dialogue. Instead, they beg us to turn our brains into mush, while the fancy images on the screen keep us constantly entertained.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is a film so radically different from the first three that it shouldn't even be considered a part of the series. While the first two films revolutionized the action genre with the depth of their characters and plot, Salvation is a film that favors style over substance to a degree usually reserved for the likes of Michael Bay. It's so unrecognizable and detached from the original films that it resorts to a plethora of fan services, in a sad attempt to prove it's an actual sequel (I was surprised [and relieved] that nobody said \\"Hasta la vista, baby!\\").<br /><br />This unjustifiable train wreck has resulted in a mindless special effects exhibit, featuring boring action and even more boring characters, who, although they try and convince us there's an actual story hidden somewhere, ultimately fail in doing anything at all.<br /><br />This movie is responsible for over two hours that I've wasted from my life, time I could've spent on far more productive and fulfilling activities, like falling asleep for instance. I could rant like a nerd for hours about the movie, but then again, it's not worth wasting any more time on, so I'll conclude by pointing out that the director's name (McG) sounds like something on the dollar menu at McDonalds. Something you would probably find hair in.I was surprised [and relieved] that nobody said \\"Hasta la vista, baby!\\").<br /><br />This unjustifiable train wreck has resulted in a mindless special effects exhibit, featuring boring action and even more boring characters, who, although they try and convince us there's an actual story hidden somewhere, ultimately fail in doing anything at all.<br /><br />This movie is responsible for over two hours that I've wasted from my life, time I could've spent on far more productive and fulfilling activities, like falling asleep for instance.

B002BWP4A6|4.0|The White Ribbon is a dark, quiet, brooding film which may isolate and divide many of its viewers, but those who truly engage themselves within its world will be surprised, disturbed, and deeply affected by the film's uniquely brutal beauty.<br /><br />Taking place in a small village in Germany the year before the outbreak of the First World War, the film follows the lives of several different characters. There is the local pastor, a serious, brutal man who, in the beginning of the film, punishes two of his children for staying out after dark by refusing them food and beating them with a cane. He later ties a white ribbon around their arms to remind them of purity and morality. There is also the local doctor, his daughter Anna, the school-teacher, and the Felder family, a poor family of farmers who are struck by tragedy when their mother dies in a work accident.<br /><br />The village is plagued by a series of seemingly random acts of violence and malice. It begins when the local doctor is tripped on a wire while riding his horse, then continues with the torturing of the Baron's son and the burning of a barn. Nobody in the village has any idea of who could be responsible for the crimes, but the school-teacher believes the children may have the anser.<br /><br />This film is not an everyday `whodunit' mystery, where the audience guesses who is behind the crime only to have the entire mystery wrapped up nice and tidy in the third act. Master director Michael Haneke doesn't wrap the conclusion in a candy-colored ribbon and hand it to the audience. The ending is ambiguous in that the audience can come to their own conclusions as to who did what or if one character is right or wrong. This may be new to many viewers, but such a bold style of film-making is quite refreshing to see in a world of remakes and what-have-yous.<br /><br />That isn't to say the film is at all unsatisfying. The entire film is a series of scenes which can shock, disturb, surprise, or enlighten the viewer. The plot is thick and involving in that every scene is important to the narrative. Not a second is spared, and every frame has a meaning. The cinematography of the film is superb. It was filmed in color then rendered into black & white. This was a wise decision on Haneke's part, not only because the black &white perfectly suits the dark tone and setting of the film, but also because it resulted in beautiful, sometimes mesmerizing images which can linger in the mind for days on end.<br /><br />I remember first reading about The White Ribbon winning the palm D'or (grand prize award) at the prestigious Cannes film festival early last year. Little did I know that it would be almost an entire year before I would get to see the film in American theaters. I was slightly disappointed when I actually went to see the film only to realize that my brother and I were the only ones in the theater. I strongly urge you to see this film, as I believe it is one of the most original and thought-provoking films of the last ten years.viewer.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Metallica's newest record, Death Magnetic, is a rip-roaring return to classic form, and re-establishes the band as the reighning kings of commercial Heavy Metal. Impressive guitar work, progressive song structures, and lyrics dealing with themes of death and redemption are elements that echo the late 80's `golden' era of Metallica. Specifically the progressive thrash classic `...And Justice For All\\".<br /><br />Since their landmark commercial smash \\"The Black Album\\" in 1991, Metallica have been caught in a creative and popular decline that has lasted over a decade. This trend reached its climax with the disastrous St. Anger in 2003 and the release of an all- too revealing documentary titled `Some Kind Of Monster' in 2004.<br /><br /> In the years since, old school metal has experienced a major resurgence in popularity. This can be attributed to the appeal of bands such as Avenged Sevenfold and Trivium, both of whom consider Metallica to be their biggest influence. Another factor in this phenomenon are the video games Guitar Hero and Rock Band, who introduce hordes of new fans to the music of hard rock and metal bands everyday.<br /><br />The public's newfound interest in heavy metal prompted Metallica to dig themselves out of the creative grave and redeem themselves with a record that brings new life to the monster.  In September 2008, they released the incredible `Death Magnetic'. Tracks such as `That Was Just Your Life', The Judas Kiss', and the album's frantic closer `My Apocalypse' are all evidence that Metallica still possess the thrash metal chops that made their first three albums masterpieces within the genre. `Cyanide' and `The End Of The Line' are a bit more mellow and rocking songs, but are just as effective and memorable, having melodic and fluid verses that flow into catchy choruses that sound larger than life.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest song on the album is the incredible ballad `The Day That Never Comes'. Beginning with a touching vocal line and lyrics dealing with lead singer and guitarist James Hetfield's troubled youth, the song picks up near the end, before evolving into an all out assault complete with an impressive guitar solo from lead Guitarist Kirk Hammet. The song is similar to their grammy award winning epic `one', which appeared on \\"..And Justice For All\\".<br /><br />The album isn't without its flaws though. `The Unforgiven III', while not a terrible song, doesn't quite live up to the power and beauty of its predecessors, `Unforgiven' and `Unforgiven II'. `Suicide and Redemption' is a ten-minute long instrumental that seems overlong and plodding in some areas, but still features marvelous guitar playing from James and Kirk.<br /><br /> Redemption plays an important part in the lyrical and musical themes of this record. The advertisements promised Death Magnetic to be `The Return Of Metallica', the record that would rescue Metallica from the grave they dug themselves into over the years. That's exactly what this record represents, the redemption of Metallica, the rebirth of their creativity, and the hope for new life and music to continue in the future.<br /><br />Overall, Death Magnetic is an exhilarating dose of Metal that seems custom fit for the changing culture of the new millennium. It is the true return to form the fans have been waiting for, complete with thoughtful lyrics, riffs, and actual guitar solos. With a running time of 75 minutes, this record reveals new secrets with every listen, and never grows dull or old. With a North American tour planned for this winter, the future seems bright for Metallica, fans can only hope it doesn't take another five years to produce a follow up.lyrics dealing with lead singer and guitarist James Hetfield's troubled youth, the song picks up near the end, before evolving into an all out assault complete with an impressive guitar solo from lead Guitarist Kirk Hammet.

B001AIRUP4|5.0|The early 90's was a great time for film and animation, especially for Walt Disney Studios, who were experiencing a renaissance in terms of quality and popularity. Another giant at the time was Tim Burton, a star director who directed both the Batman films as well as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton has a unique vision and an ability to materialize his colorful personality better than most other film makers are cable of. From the very beginning, the idea of Tim Burton and Disney collaborating on a stop-motion animation film and its a match made in heaven. Add score master Danny Elfman to write the music, and you've got history in the making!<br /><br />The film opens with a brilliant song called 'This is Halloween', that establishes the setting and many of the major characters as they prepare to celebrate their yearly ritual of Halloween. They live in Halloweentown, so Halloween is kind of a big deal for them. They all go bananas when their pumpkin master Jack Skelington rolls onto the scene sporting a flaming pumpkin. He gives a spectacular show and everybody loves him, but in classic Disney style our hero is riddled with inner turmoil, longing for something new instead of the same ritual year by year. He wanders off and discovers a new holiday, Christmas! Jack falls in love with the jolly spirit of Christmas as a contradiction to his normal life and attempts to make the next Christmas the best one ever, though it doesn't exactly go the way he plans.<br /><br />The film is filled with catchy and memorable songs that will definitely tempt you to sing along (even in a crowded theater). Some of my personal favorite tracks from the movie are 'Jack's Lament', the town meeting song, and 'Making Christmas'. The songs are so memorable and iconic that there even exists a tribute album entirely dedicated to them, and it's pretty good too! Although it doesn't hold a candle to the originals by Danny Elfman, that man is a genius.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation was an excellent choice because it gives the film a very unique, life-like look. The animators put many man-hours into making the film frame-by-frame, and their dedication shows in the attention to detail. The amount of detail and care given to smooth out the movements really makes everything look a lot more realistic than most traditionally animated films. Tim Burton's twisted and dark imagination comes to life in the most fantastic of ways in Halloweentown, populated by a whole bunch of weird and wacky monsters who are honestly more lovable than scary (until they bite your face off).<br /><br />There is a lot of humor in this movie, which I really appreciate because it helps keep things interesting. One of the most hilarious characters in the movie is the Mayor, who switches between his confident face and nervous face to wacky results. Another favorite of mine is the Oogey Boogey Man. That guy used to crack me up as a kid. I have to admit, though, his ending part really used to freak me out.<br /><br />I've seen this movie three times in movie theaters when it was rereleased in 3d. It has remained a favorite of mine since I was a little kid and had it on VHS. For some reason it became a trendy, hot topic sort of thing and got super popular, but to me its not a fashion trend its a great animated movie!was an excellent choice because it gives the film a very unique, life-like look.

Tim Burton's twisted and dark imagination comes to life in the most fantastic of ways in Halloweentown, populated by a whole bunch of weird and wacky monsters who are honestly more lovable than scary (until they bite your face off).<br /><br />There is a lot of humor in this movie, which I really appreciate because it helps keep things interesting. One of the most hilarious characters in the movie is the Mayor, who switches between his confident face and nervous face to wacky results. Another favorite of mine is the Oogey Boogey Man. That guy used to crack me up as a kid. I have to admit, though, his ending part really used to freak me out.<br /><br />I've seen this movie three times in movie theaters when it was rereleased in 3d. It has remained a favorite of mine since I was a little kid and had it on VHS. For some reason it became a trendy, hot topic sort of thing and got super popular, but to me its not a fashion trend its a great animated movie!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is one of the best made-for-TV series I've seen in a while.  I particularly enjoy it because it's based on the historical activities of my ancestors, the Vikings.  I'm looking forward to watching the next episodes as soon as they come out!
B00BGR8030|5.0|`Paris, Texas' is a stunning and sublime portrait of the human spirit's quest for redemption and belonging, an extraordinary film which displays a remarkable understanding of its characters and of the vast, lonely world they inhabit. Through beautifully photographed images and flawlessly executed movements and dialogue, the film manages to elicit complex and profound emotions while still managing to maintain a genuine and personal perspective of reality. Rarely are films successful in presenting a world so rich with such authentic humanity, but `Paris, Texas' is unique in its ability to transcend the artistic boundaries of dramatic film-making, and will slowly but surely integrate itself into the lives of those who accept it for the quiet masterpiece it truly is.<br /><br />The severely underrated Harry Dean Stanton stars as Travis Stockwell, a lonely drifter who wanders aimlessly through a spacious and empty desert somewhere in the American Midwest, endlessly searching for something profoundly important, yet he can't quite remember what that something is. Travis is eventually discovered by his successful brother Walt, who is shocked that Travis is still alive. Walt explains to the dirty and mute Travis that he had completely disappeared for four long years, during which time he and his wife had been raising Travis' eight year old son Hunter for him. After Travis lays eyes upon Hunter for the first time in four years, memories of love and loss flood back into his conscious, and he soon embarks on a journey to rejuvenate his long disbanded family.<br /><br />What proceeds is a tale of reunion and rediscovery, where cherished memories of love and loyalty are finally restored and the emotional bonds tattered by years of loneliness and alienation are once again restored. One of the more remarkable aspects of the film is its dedication to the development of its characters; it takes its time to illustrate their often complex feelings, and the story is told through their context. Travis' early attempts to earn the trust of Hunter are so moving and sincere that it becomes heart-breaking to see him fail. The scenes are effective without the aid of melodramatic music or phony dialogue. They exist within a solid reality, where organic human emotions take center stage.<br /><br />Harry Dean Stanton delivers a brilliant performance, capturing every obscure idiosyncrasy and mannerism of his eccentric character with outstanding authenticity and style. His performance is almost haunting in its power to inspire such a wide range of emotions. His soul-bearing monologue near the end of the film is a high-water mark for character acting and the undisputed highlight of the film. It's one of the most beautifully emotional scenes I've ever had the pleasure of viewing, one which has stuck in my mind months after originally seeing it. It's such a brilliant monologue that I would feel guilty spoiling the context in which it's delivered.<br /><br />Paris, Texas is an American fairy tale of love and redemption, where the loneliness of the vast desert plains is echoed in the sprawling cities which surround them. It defies all stereotypes and genres, creating a world unique to the art of film, where the story relies not on a sequence of contrived events but on the genuine feelings and individual experiences of the characters. It's a slow and quiet meditation on life, a subtle film of unparalleled beauty and substance. There's no doubt in my mind that it's one of the greatest films ever made. A new reissue of Paris, Texas will be released on Blu-Ray and DVD on January 26 through the Criterion collection.ontext.

B007V693YK|1.0|I wanted this app to be awesome so I disregarded the bad reviews. The tabs are so laggy it's impossible actually learn anything. Save yourself $3.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book was chosen as our book of the month to book club. I initially thought, oh no, this is so not something I would read. Ended up living the book and read it in one day!!!
6304493681|4.0|So, this movie still confuses me. I like it, but I can't say I understand all of it. However, it looks very cool, and that can be appreciated at least. The main character gets naked a lot, which is kinda weird, but it serves an actual, practical purpose. And she is the only character I've ever seen try to pull something so hard that she ripped her arms off...she's a robot, shut up.
B0054S6N04|5.0|Great story with plenty of twists and turns. Fair warning it is a murder mystery, but the happily ever after is just that sweeter because of it. The dialogue and relationships were wonderful and the humor perfectly timed. Reinforces no one is perfect but hold out for the one that I perfect for you!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Fantastic! Better than the series. You get so many details and so much more information about the plot, characters , setting, I love the collection. the HBO chapters are a nice companion to the story.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I just love this quick reading romance book.  Good story, perfect for teens and young adults and me too. Lol
B009UX2YAC|3.0|fun fun good stuff great new and exiting ok game good set ups true to life scenarios ha lol legal yes indeed
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show, always creative and suspenseful from start to finish. Has you reeled in and glued to the television from the start, my kind of show!  Absolutely love this show!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I was so psyched to see this movie out of the vault.  I love the old Disney Movies and this one does not disappoint!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Got hooked after the first show!  Can't wait for the next season to start! I loved every moment, the cast is incredible.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Well, all my accolades for this CD relate to the quality of the recording, and to Amy as an artist. The actual CD took quite a while to get to me, and the case was cracked when it arrived.
0553801473|2.0|This book is an utter disappointment. Martin has managed to create his least exciting book of the series, despite having the half of the cast who are the most crucial to work with.<br /><br />I'll avoid spoiling by keeping things general, but relevant.<br />The writing itself has devolved dreadfully, Martin is repeating tropes and sayings of characters so much that he has gone beyond a parody of himself. Dany has become a ridiculous sex crazed nubile woman, his other women have become no different. Such stereotyping of women would make Jordan cringe.<br /><br />Jon, my favourite character, is now stuck in a malaise ridden plotline, Tyrion fairs no better. You'll be disappointed by the most promising plot lines in the book, which feature Bran and a few others. I won't say how, but you will be cursing Martin's narrative choices.<br /><br />The Martells and the Greyjoys, dreadfully boring and they feel irrelevant. There'll be a cast of characters introduced whose names you'll struggle to pronounce, let alone remember. All these aspect combine to make the book feel like filler. After reading Feast, which while testing was not bad at all, you're going to be let down by the irrelevance of this book.<br /><br />I don't think I can bring myself to read the Winds of Winter when it comes out. I think Martin has jumped the shark.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Very impressive collaborations between classic Tony, and so many new artists of great reknown. Especially loved his &#34;That's Why the Lady is a Tramp&#34; with Lady Gaga!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very fun and reminds me of temple run 1 and 2, it I'd an addictive yet entertaining free app.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Everything i'd come to expect from the only person who could pick up where Robert Jordan left off. Epic storyline, characters you cant help but adore, and a fantasy world that keeps on amazing you. I cant wait to read the next installment.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Fun game just wish you didn't have the energy crap to be able to play instead wish you could play nonstop.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Another well executed book by Karen - I will never grow tried of reading her books time & time again!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|We enjoyed this movie with light comedy, human interactions and witty dialogues. May be we are just tired of the intense scenes and the head hurting plots. This movie is simple and yet to the point exposing frailties of each person without putting anyone down. I read a comment that this movie is racist and I don't think so at all.

B00846REIS|3.0|This book was filled with erotic scenes. However, I did not like the story line set around it. Gideon and Eva both have issues due to past sexual abuse. There love and want for each other is very intense. Eva keeps running from her problems as Gideon chases after every time, it shows how much he cares for her.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of my favorite shows ever! It's great to have the convenience of watching The Walking Dead when and where I want to.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Love Denzel, and this was a very different role he played, but he pulled it off well.  Really enjoyed all the drama.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just started watching the series two weeks ago. After watching the 1st 2 seasons for free - had to pay to get caught up on this season!<br /><br />Well written, edge of your seat!

B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor works great. Is really fast in any operation and the operating system love it.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like is the cooler. Is pretty loud when the processor is a full load.<br /><br />But I recommend this processor.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This really was a good book. It was an easy read and really puts life into perspective. Now it's time to watch the movie. :)
B004JLDSIC|5.0|There's something about having a superior drummer come aboard, in certain jazz bands! For the Dave Brubeck Quartet, their recorded jazz hit a higher level of musicality with the addition of Joe Morello during the mid-fifties( hear their Jazz Impressions of the U.S.A. album);  during the same time period, for Ahmad Jamal it was the addition of Vernel Fournier( hear Jamal's But Not For Me album, which includes the groundbreaking Pionciana)! Similiarly, The Lyric, with the addition of Matt Skelton( and with the great sound engineering), Stacey Kent, who never sounded better, and her husband's band( Tomlinson on tenor, David Newton on piano, Dave Chamberlain on double bass, and Skelton on drums) evolved into a superior level of music making!<br /><br />Their baker's dozen of songs are all top quality renditions! I was particularly taken by their version of Michel LeGrand's What Are you Doing the Rest of Your Life, where Kent siezes on the English version( she had previously recorded a French version) in an intensely intimate and romantic reading of Marilyn and Alan Bergman's lyrics; If I Were a Bell features the best vocal rendition I've ever heard of this Frank Loesser tune( instrumentally, Miles Davis' 50's Quintet's version is the best I've heard), and Tomlinson/Kent take The Surrey with the Fringe on the Top( unlike Jamal's memorable uptempo version on But Not for Me) in a lanquid, slow tempo that is very harmonious with the meaning of the lyrics - to these ears very becoming, and which even achieves an uncanny swing in spots!<br /><br />This CD would be an almost unfair introduction to the music of Jim Tomlinson and Stacey Kent, and for devotees of this couple's music, this CD is a must addition to their Tomlinson/Kent collection!
B001DZLAWI|4.0|No this is not master of puppets or ride the lightning  . however its still a killer album . metallica is good at thrash . this is the album that influanced to start a vinyl collection because on you tube if you look at the loudness war debate the guitar crunch sound works better with analog then digital . rick ruben is a better music producer then bob rock . he is also grate working with slayer . I did not get the demos but if you go to you tube you will love the way the demos to this album sound .
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this book as a young girl. 40 years later, I still have my original copy. Over the years, it's become worn and fragile. To be able to have a Kindle version is such a gift. This story is amazing. I cried and celebrated with the characters. As a young girl who loves to read, I totally identified with Francie. As a mother of two now, I can see the world through Katie's eyes. If you have never read this book before, give yourself that present now. If you have read it, read it again. You won't be disappointed.
B0017WCERM|5.0|master of puppets is up thare with purple haze in the top 100 guitar solos of all time , but the whole album rocks this is a true classic . metallica will never be the same without cliff burton , he died on a tour bus accident . his base playing was insane he had a one of a kind sound R.I.P cliff .
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|This is a great, free French channel.  If you are looking for free entertainment, news, etc. in French, then this is it!  I recommend it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I've only played a few levels so far, but I enjoy both the pace and design of the game. I do enjoy slower, more thoughtful games. If you feel the same then I recommend giving this game a try.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a delightful movie.  It is funny, and I recommend it.  My daughter loves it, and wants to watch it over and over.  This is how I know when a movie gets a five-star rating.
0786889284|2.0|Lot too many mysteries today, this needed editing. Really feels padded. Much too much tortured thinking and wondering by the characters, until it tortures the reader, too. You want to tell the author that you get it, all ready, can we get back to the story, please! A shame because the basic plot is strong and some scenes are great examples of suspenseful writing.
0515123447|4.0|The first book in the series.  Good reading and a long series, so there are plenty more if you start on the first one.
B006T75DUU|4.0|I've read this book about 5 times in the last 25 years while traveling around the country and around the world.  Never gets old.  If you've read it before, read it again.
0062238868|5.0|This story make one proud of what our military does for us on a daily basis.  Taking out the bad guys that want to kill us.  Our troops stand for freedom throughout the world.  Being the good guy makes every nut job in every other country hate us, not our troops but our way of life.  They don't understand it and they feel the only thing they can do about it is kill us.  You get the idea.  We have to look out for ourselves, not to many will come to our aid.<br />Kris Kyle and all the troops need our support and thanks for a job well done.<br />Kris Kyle - rest in peace.  You did a great job.
B008Y212PI|4.0|this game is great in making you use math and logic skills.  It helps keep your mind sharp and your reasoning skills at the top of the game.  Beside it is entertaining and makes waiting for appt. Go by quickly.
B0015AARJI|5.0|We've had tons of problems with aftermarket controllers which are generally equally as expensive if not more so. They would continually break with one or more buttons becoming unresponsive after merely a few weeks. This controller has held up incredibly well to my younger kids (ages 6 and 4). No more wasting money on knockoffs that don't last!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books where a work of art  it was impossible to put them down.  Took me by surprise with all then twist and turns
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a beautiful true story.  I had a very hard time putting it down!  I thank this doctor for sharing his experience with the world.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I was never into watching series TV. Always have on stock market stations and all sports. Then 1 day about 6 weeks ago  I caught an episode of Castle. Absolutely fell in love with the characters ( esp. Fillion,of course ) LOL<br />The writers of thiese storylines are excellent.The comedy lines inserted at all the right places are written with much thought.<br />I never had a bucket list, but at age 75, I have now. To see Fillion in person.. Hell, I'd be happy to be able to afford to purchase the videos of each season. Got a copy of season 4 and wore it out already.<br /> I for one will be extremely disappointed in they don't renew Castle for season 6.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I loved the book even though it left me hanging . But other than that it was the best book ever!
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is a great  TV series. Will be absoulely horrified if the don't have a season 6 .<br />Next Social security day LOL  I will purchase season 3
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The word is FABULOUS left me wanting more more can't wait for third season !!!!! I'm hooked on this series.<br />Naming a new tri color collie pup Khaleessi.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|At first this is one of the better build your village games. But once it doubles the cost for land... that is when all the issues start. Every holiday they offer \\"specials \\" that never appear for you to get.  I now got to the under ground. But lost all my friends and keep trying to add them back but they are not saving and once topside again the games skipper glitches and at times completely freezes.  Fun to play and the side game is frustrating. Which keeps you coming back for more. Overall a great way to kill some time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy way to spend a few minutes. I have become addicted to this game and recommend it for anybody looking for something fun.
B008JAGG38|4.0|When you rent or buy this movie you know it's going to be more of the same exploits from the gang.  No disappointment here.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was an interesting book by someone who had a NDE, but it was not as interesting or compelling as other books I have read on the subject.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|This is a great performance that exceeds expectations. The blue ray is awesome - from the music to the editing- and is backed up by the cds to enjoy away from the TV. You do not need to be a Zeppelin fan to enjoy this, in what is in all reality, the band's last concert performance ever.<br />Fantastic!
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a fun game. If you don't have the time, don't buy it though. You will not be able to put it down.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|i had bought some other cheap cable that did not work but this worksgreat though expensive..it is a great cable.

B0054SMID0|4.0|Plenty of twists to keep you interested and entertained, wished there were more like this movie. Will watch again and again.
B005PK1G76|1.0|I unwrapped this caddy and was hit by a horrible chemical/gasoline smell. I attached it to my stroller anyway, figuring it just needed to air out. When I returned to the room a couple of hours later, I could smell it from across the room. So I put it outside to air out. Three days later, it still managed to make the whole room smell. I will return it and find an alternative.
B0012FHGCW|3.0|This film had a potential for so much more, in the end it just fell short for a film that has you sitting at the edge of your seat throughout. This could have been 4 stars with a better ending.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|it's ok and that's about it.  it doesn't match well with an existing app.  i was hoping for a more detailed presentation but...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinerest!  I have been newly introduced to this amazing site.  It is a great inspiration to get new ideas and share them with others...so fun...you're gonna love it!
6305212112|5.0|The DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition. It was a movie that I had never seen but had always wanted to . It did not dissapoint me. It was a very touching story . I would recommend it to anyone who likes heart warming stories of friendship.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|It seems as if each one of these books get better. Perhaps the writer is getting more into character, or perhaps I am.  Either way, a good read for any Castle fan, as well as other mystery readers.
0143039482|5.0|The book arrived on time,was packaged securely and was in perfect condition. John Steinbeck is one of my favorite writers. I love this book and look forward to reading it again.

B009NLN2CU|1.0|I regret to say that this is not a UK Harvest original, but a green vinyl Isreal made fake. I had to return for a refund which took a month to process. Not what I had in mind. I have owned several different pressings of this record, and the original is excellent. This press is the bottom of them all, BEWARE.
1401324649|5.0|A good ride, and history lesson! Humorous, clever, enjoyable and the characters were all endearing for in spite of, or perhaps because of, their flaws.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Out of all of these types of games, I love this one the most. I recommend it for people of all ages and although you can buy things with real money, its not necessary to have a great resturant.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|The whole family really enjoyed this movie. Great animation. Cute storyline. Loved the unexpected mystery person reveal in the climax. Overall it is a great family movie!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Great movie, hilarious even if you aren't a fan of singing this movie is sure to please. Humorous and delightful.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is very different and interesting.  It appears that a lot of energy has gone into this game to make it better than usual.  Each game is unique.  Fun.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it really is what a battery app should do. as long as it tells me how much battery life I have left and doesn't waste it, it's great.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I just purchased this mouse to replace a logitec gaming mouse that lasted about a year. Due to the fact logitec no longer makes the mouse I figured I would give this one a try. So far ive had it about a week and im happy with it. The mouse is comfortable and works very well. I definitely like being able to change the dpi on the fly especially when im playing RPG's. The mouse is well designed and I dont have many things bad to say about it performance wise. The only thing i would change is the side buttons, because they are so large its very easy to hit them on accident and because they curve around your thumb. I would rather have them in a straight line and smaller like my logitech buttons were. Also the macro function of the mouse is pretty useless due to the fact you cant record anything other than mouse clicks. Overall I like the mouse, id make a few minor changes but thats about it. We shall see how long this one lasts.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Everyone should see this movie. Burning natural gas may be clean, but producing it is not. Have we learned noting from past environmental disasters?
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I was not expecting much because most horror movies tend to disappoint. This one was different.  It was interesting and creepy and good acting, too.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I always enjoy this talented group & watching their videos brings me a  little closer to a country I have always wanted to visit, this was purchased as a gift, she loved it too
B001XUPGLY|4.0|I liked it. but like Netflex better because the movies and tv series are free and you pay for the streaming.  with amazon, you pay for a year and then still have to pay for a lot of movies and tv series
0823003035|3.0|Not the best. Ok for the 9th grade student, but does not meet the needs of a serious student artist.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this battery app. Simple to use and real easy to change settings. So much better at letting me know how much battery time left.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I found this story very predictable and was really put off by the &#34;twist&#34; at the end about the friend next door. Come on.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|If you can get used to reading subtitles...which lasts about 10 minutes...this movie is great!!  A must for any movie collection!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is so much fun! I love it much more than temple runbecause I don't have to tilt the screen also because little kids can understand the graphics too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead season 3 does have a lot of &#34;filler&#34; episodes where not a whole lot happens...which is disappointing, but I'm still a true 5-star fan, through and through!!  Love walking dead!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Great book!  I think it was easily worth the cost to have read it for all of the valuable information inside.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|A or more about how the first place for the world of America and the worldly and just like you are a kiss girls
B004NELBPC|5.0|This app gives new one cannot get from other agencies.  It is accurate and informative.  I recommend it as one source of news.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I swear this is the best game ever invented. This is my favroite game ever. I have played this game more than thousand times.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed some of this book, but felt it lagged excessively in many chapters. The tragedy of how lives get torn apart and never heal is so much a part of our everyday news cycle that I enjoyed listening to the narrator describe how your life  can be torn upside down in an instant and you  barely have time to react to the transformation. I never saw the ending coming and was not prepared for it. When I read this book I kept thinking of two other high-profile cases splashed over the news \\" Casey Anthony\\" and \\" Amanda Knox\\"' . Who can't remember day after day of media coverage.? This at least gave me a glimpse into how people cope or try to cope with unimaginable life injustice. Very provocative and tragic.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I loved this movie. I knew nothing about it, which is my favorite way to watch movies, and was so pleasantly surprised to see Justin Timberlake, one of my favorite people,and Amy Adams is always wonderful, as is Clint Eastwood. It gives you the whole reason to watch a movie, an enjoyable time with great acting.
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|I paid $1 more for this than Wreck It Ralph and got it for 24 hours instead of 48.  I thought that was a bit of a rip off considering how much better Wreck It Ralph was.  The kids thoroughly enjoyed it, although my 4 year old son was a little freaked out by the Villain Pitch Black/Boogie Man.  They did run around playing ROTG for about the next day, or two, though.  Easier to find on Amazon, since they were all out at Red Box.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie is the best children's movie I have seen...and I have seen them all I feel like.  The message is beautiful, and delivered with a combination of humor, sadness, love and hope.  It is a definite purchase, and if I could give it more stars I would. I cannot say enough positive things about this movie...you will give it 5 stars too, unless of course you just don't get that we should never be controlled by fear!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great attention to detail, thoughtful story line, and wonderful rendering.  Fantastic cast and nostalgia with the 80's and 90's video games.  Basically, this movie has it all.  Well worth the HD price for the 48 hour rental.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Very polished and fun. Play is nice and quick, rpg elements work well. Only played an hour so far. Worth the $2.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This is a worthy prequel to the \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" As of now there has yet to have been a film worthy to its sequel or prequel. The production starts out in black and white as the original film and switches to color. Aspects of Kansas are carried over into Oz so pay attention. The film has some early twists, which you may already know if you read any review, but it is nothing complicated.<br /><br />James Franco stars in the title role. He reminded me of Edward Norton in \\"The Illusionist.\\" Oz is a phoney and a bit of a womanizer. His magic consists of flash powder, glue, and determination.<br /><br />The best was Mila Kunis. She owned Theodora. Clearly a People's Choice Award. Her performance alone was worth the price of admission. The movie meshes neatly into the film we all know and love. Rachel Weisz shined in her performance as well. The on screen chemistry between Franco and Michelle Williams could improve.<br /><br />The flying baboons are far more fierce and scary than the flying monkeys in the original. Indeed, if your child has trouble with nightmares from horror films, you might think twice of taking them, but go yourself. Better than the \\"Snow White and the Huntsman.\\"
B008QE9XD2|3.0|If you were a huge Dark Shadows fan don't waste your money on this.I went into it  knowing it was a comedy of sorts so I have only myself to blame.This is more campy farce than anything else...made me miss the original even more.SyFy bring it back!!!
0198321511|4.0|The Tempest is an enchanting play that is fun and whimsical. Prospero had been wronged and deposed as his position of Duke of Milan. Ambitious nobles forced him to flee into exile. Prospero and his daughter Miranda met the spirit Ariel who is trapped on the island. Ariel taught him the magical arts and Prospero got a measure of revenge by conjuring up a tempest that shipwrecked the group of nobles.<br /><br />Prospero's intent was to provide for his daughter. He got Ferdinand to be isolated on the island. He fell in love with his daughter Miranda. The nobles endured some hardship and privation and were taught a lesson in morality. Caliban was a disgruntled mongrel of the spirit world. He hated his master and set off a plot to murder Prospero. His drunk companions were bungling and inept. Their attempts proved to be easily thwarted and were a complete farce.<br /><br />In the end, there is joy in the upcoming marriage of Ferdinand and Miranda. There is reconciliation between Prospero and the nobles. Ariel gains his freedom for his faithful and loyal service to Prospero. Prospero got to return to enjoy the pleasure of Milan.<br /><br />This was an entertaining play, but was not one of Shakespeare's best. The message of love and reconciliation were important themes, as was accountability and repentance for transgressions. Some of the scenes were a bit saccharine and predictable. This was meant to be a light hearted comedy, a departure from the serious tragedies like Macbeth, Othello, and Julius Caesar. In a way, this play was the antithesis of Romeo and Juliet. The warring factions of Italian politics got together and did what was in the best interests of their children. This was a fanciful and pleasant play in the tradtion of A Midsummer's Night Dream.<br /><br />This edition of the play was very helpful because it offered translations of the unfamiliar words and idiomatic expressions. There were some illustrations and some recaps of key plot events. There were a lot of characters of the play and the plot was a little difficult to follow in spots.of characters of the play and the plot was a little difficult to follow in spots.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|This album is the first album I purchased from this band and my collection now includes the self-titled album and Waking the Fallen. This one is the first one I've made it through and I'm very impressed! Great things going on in this album and many talents! M. Shadows has probably the most distinguishable voice out the vocalists I've listened to. Nobody else sings anything like him. The guitars on this album are just outstanding. These guys are close to being let into the club of the greatest guitar duos with Murray/Smith, Gelotte/Strömblad, and Tipton/Downing! This album is probably one of the best releases of 2010!<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />1. Nightmare- Starts off eerie and creepily, but then the guitars and drums come in and just hit you like a train! The galloping begins and your nightmare comes to life when M. Shadows comes in! The drums are top notch! The Rev will be missed. Portnoy did a great job covering his parts and playing in The Rev's style (This may be my first Sevenfold album, but I'm a huge Dream Theater fan and I know that Portnoy would've been a lot more intense and dramatic in his fills). The chorus is so emotional because the band is hurt by the loss of their brother and just the whole song has a melancholy metal style that kicks major butt! There are definitely many genres crossed in here. The guitars are like NOTHING else I've heard in metal music. They are very bluesy and they add a new twist to neoclassical type runs. I love rocking out to this song. It is a very good song and only the beginning of this album!<br /><br />2. Welcome to the Family- The drums do a great intro and the guitars just start jamming. This song was always one of my favorites and still is! I love how many genres they cross so easily and effectively! The guitars just play melodic/bluesy runs through out the chorus and they do some very heavy shredding and riffing in the verses! Shadows' vocals are even more awesome in this song than the previous song! I love this song with a passion and I always rock out to this song! It doesn't ever get much better than this song for me in this album...but there are a few more songs that match the charisma of this one for me later in the album! This one is going to be remembered years from now as one of their classics. I guarantee it. It is a great song!<br /><br />3. Danger Line- I don't understand all the reviewers bashing this song! I think it's a good song! It rocks! It starts off with a marching snare part and then speeds up. This one shows more hard rock roots with metal/blues guitars. I enjoy this song needless to say. It may not rank with Welcome to the Family or Natural Born Killer, but it is a good song. It still delivers the same amount of emotion and riffage that the other tracks do too. I'd love to see this song performed live though. It'd be good to see that. I must say that I really enjoy the bridge with all the passionate vocals. Love it!<br /><br />4. Buried Alive- This one starts off as a ballad and sounds really good. It's the guitars playing a bluesy intro and then some strings come in to accompany the guitars. It is a beautiful intro. Then the higher octave starts playing when the bass and drums join in. Then Shadows comes in as passionate as ever. I like this song. It has a nice beat and the chorus is heavier and most importantly emotional. The thing that holds this album together for me is the passion and emotion the band has put into it. This song is full of emotion and then right when you least expect it, the song intensifies and becomes a chugging rocker. I had mixed feelings about it but I like it now. The guitar solo ends and then it turns into a dark and brewing rocker. It sounds more evil than the title track. This song is just amazing in that respect that it starts off slow and mellow and sad yet beautiful, then effortlessly turns into a grim metal rocker! Great song!<br /><br />5. Natural Born Killer- This song starts off with a speed metal vibe. In your face and merciless and the drums just make it even heavier! Then it turns into a groove/thrash type verse and Shadows sounds at his best here! The pre-chorus has great drum work and the chorus is epic and slower than you'd think after being slammed by the intro. The genre crossing this band does on this song is probably more pronounced considering that each part of the song is a different type of metal. I love it because it's like a rollercoaster ride! You aren't expecting it to do certain things. The solo starts off brilliantly and continues being amazing! My absolute favorite part is the bridge! It still gives me goosebumps! The lyrics are so thought provoking to me in the bridge and it's got an Iron Maiden type vocal line over alternative metal guitars and Dream Theater style drums (wonder why). This is probably my favorite track on the whole album. It just has a great amount of emotion and I just love it!<br /><br />6. So Far Away- This is the band's ballad sung to The Rev. It's probably the emotional peak of the album. It is an important track and a good track. I like the song a lot. It isn't the best ballad on here though. I like Victim more. But this one is fantastic in its own right. It is the band singing to their fallen brother. A good track and a worthy single.<br /><br />7. God Hates Us- This starts off slowly on guitar and it's really beautiful. Then the drums come in and the guitars start riffing and the song just explodes in your face! The instruments in here are GREAT!!! But something about the vocal delivery just isn't connecting with me and I don't like the song that much. It's not the screaming, I don't mind it. I just don't like the song that much. But I can see why most people do like it. It's just not the song I praise.<br /><br />8. Victim- This song starts off with bells and a mellow guitar part. And then a high voice comes in and just sparks a lot of emotion. This song for me is probably the best slower song on the album. Shadows and the bandare singing about how they feel like victims. They feel like something got stolen from them and they want it back. It is true. The Rev was just taken from them and they got robbed of their drummer and their brother. This song hits my heart harder than So Far Away. This one is more bluesy in the vocals as well as the guitars. It sounds like heaven flowing from my speakers into my ears. This song ranks up with Natural Born Killer and Welcome to the Family for me. These 3 songs have a quality to them that just make them stand out from the rest of the songs to me. I know that my opinions aren't shared a lot, but if you haven't heard this album before, check this song out instead of So Far Away and check out Natural Born Killer instead of the title track. This one is seriously a masterpiece. Words can't do this song justice.<br /><br />9. Tonight the World Dies- This one just annoys me. I don't like this one in the least bit. This ballad just has no point on the album. Especially because it comes right after a 7 minute ballad. Sorry, but I think this one shouldn't have made the album.<br /><br />10. Fiction- This one starts off with a haunting piano part. Then the drums come in and play a triplet gallop beat. The vocals are haunting on this one because The Rev is singing it with Shadows singing over him. It has a nice gallop to it. It's a good song and it's an important track because it is the last thing that the Rev gave to his fans. I like the track, but it's so haunting and it's not a song that I would listen to on a daily basis. It starts to become hauntingly beautiful towards the end. And resolves to a beautiful finish. I have to say that this track isn't the best, but the fans will eat this one up because it's essentially The Rev's last track. RIP Jimmy<br /><br />11. Save Me- This starts off with a triplet bass gallop and then it turns into a Dream Theater meets blues type song. Then it goes through a bunch of cool instrumental jams and sounds really epic and onecould even mistake this for being one of Dream Theater's songs being put on here by Mike Portnoy. But when the vocals come in, we remember that this is a Sevenfold track. This song is a journey. The whole album is a dark journey through the band's emotional turmoil, but this song is a journey withing the journey. This song is a great way to end the album and I like this one a lot as well. It ranks up there, but it's my 4th favorite song on the album. It is great and I think that this song will impress anyone who is willing to hear it. While it is my fourth favorite song, it isn't one the same emotional level as Victim in my opinion. But in terms of offering guitar leads and great instrumental passages, this is the BEST! So many styles are touched in this track that I would run out of space trying to name them all. Synyster and Zacky play some of the best guitar parts of the album throughout this one song. If you are a Dream Theater fan, you will LOVE this song. This one song is better than anything that came off A Dramatic Turn of Events and Black Clouds and Silver Linings. Neither of those two albums have a single song that even touches this one. Unless DT pulls itself together, Sevenfold will be better at playing DT than DT themselves! This song is GREAT and I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />On top of crossing genres in single songs, this album has so much variety in the songs that you'll never get bored with it. None of the songs sound the same and except for Tonight the World Dies, there is never a dull moment on this album. I'm actually afraid that the other Sevenfold albums, past or future, will never stand up to the bar that this one has set. If you could have one Sevenfold album, I'd say this one for its variety and uniqueness from all other metal bands. I have heard other songs of theirs, so I do know what they sound like on other records. This one has the best overall sound to my ears. BUY IT NOW!!! This is the darkest, but best sonic journey you cantake from a metal band!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read this but as always the book is better than the movie  no loved it
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Things finally start to come together in a more interesting story. The disjointed feeling of season two is gone and we can see where the story is really going.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I like the cover. It keeps it tidy and away from harm yet easy to access. I'm a bit of a techno loser. I need little kids to show me how to work most of this stuff. So simple is good
031237674X|5.0|I am always on the lookout for books about reincarnation and past lives. I love this one because it goes into detail how the case studies of past lives were done, what proofs were used and the conclusion of the author.
B00151G08Y|4.0|The CD is great especially if you enjoy electronica/dance music.  The only complaint I have with it was that the case that it came in was smashed into a million pieces but the CD was still in great working condition and the case can be easily replaced.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I enjoyed the read, but have to say I'm skeptical. Also,  I'm not fat so I felt like a lot wasn't geared toward me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app just what I was looking for simple and easy to use.  If you want a great simple everyday calculator get this one.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|I bought this for 1 USD as welcoming &#34;present&#34; to my new kindle. I have been reading this for the past few weeks, story by story. This review tells more about the kindle than the book itself, since I have not finished it yet. Easy viewing, eye friendly and allows you to enjoy the beauty of the stories. Recommendable to own.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games I just had to know what happened next and this book certainly did not disappoint. Just seeing how The characters are growing and evolving with each new event and trial that they're faced with keeps the story interesting and gripping and makes you hungry for more. I decided to read the series again before the 2nd movie and once again, I am gripped!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is addicting i love it you would love it too. You have to download it now or you will not no how awesome it is

Parzival is a strong hero character who must fight for his own life and those of his friends whilst trying to save the one thing everyone holds sacred, their freedom to use the OASIS.<br /><br />this is a wonderfully creative story that stretches the imagination and reminds the reader that sometimes real life is the best reality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome.I wish I had gotten it in Rio but I got it in Rome.they should make one in the ocean.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app. use it for everything, from meal planning to trip planning to shopping list. not to mention the capacity to save useful info. awesome app.
0691126658|5.0|This is a great field book for East Africa, was recommended by our guide and it is loaded with every species of bird that you are prone to see on safari.  It is heavy, but well worth it.  The only negative is the difficulty in finding it, plus a bit on the costly side, but as I said, well worth it. I have not found a better guide than this one and we visit East Africa every year, so it is a crucial book to own.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|It's alright except the last level boss is like impossible to beat. All my acorns were taken away from me it was horrible. All the other levels were fine.

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Great movie, great entertainment, great author!  Now I will by the blu-ray disc so I can really enjoy it!  EXCELLENT!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down. So good! It was unlike a lot of the Nicholas Sparks books that I have read before. It was more suspenseful then some of the other books I have read by him. I would and did recommend this to family and friends because it was that good for me. It even inspired me to go and watch the movie which was good but I was a little disappointed because they changed and left out so many parts.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Enjoy big fish games on a pc. I was pleased they released some for the kindle fire hd. This one is a three match game. Enjoyable, and graphics are very nice.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book. My 13 yr old read the book for a book report. I would recommend it for older teenagers as some of the content was a bit mature for a 13 yr old.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun and entertaining. Great graphics and story line. Adjustable level of help makes it fun for all interested skill levels.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This book was good, although it didn't hold my interest at parts. I feel it almost took too long to get to the good parts, but those parts made up for the fact that it took so long.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I do not get HBO so I will wait my year for it to come out on DVD and watch all at once
B00ANGICRE|5.0|This is a great movie based on real life. The acting is excellent, the script provides plenty to think about, but some good laughs.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|super fast  this came so fast, ordered it and it was here, know the kindle fire will charge in no time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It had a few twists and  turns that was enough to keep it interesting.  I would recommend this book to any romantic at heart
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Simply well written.  Miguel is honest with his words and makes me wanna read over and over I felt like something shifted in my soul.  I will master each agreement.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Wonderful addition to the Outlander Series. Great characters, and inventive storyline. Some rather saucy adult scenes that I wouldn't recommend for immature audiences. However, it's refreshing that all of these take place within the confines of a sacramental marriage, so the book never takes on an immoral or hedonistic character. This book as well as the entire series, are suitable for male & female audiences who enjoying adventurous historic fiction. Can't wait to dive into book 4.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This truly is the greatest story of human tragedy and redemption. If only we could all learn to live outside ourselves and humbly for the benefit of others.  Jean Valjean should be an inspiration to us all!
B0035JNRXU|5.0|The best of star trek including a scary enemy, thrilling action and awesome effects with humor and funny jokes. Dont miss it
B008K9UZY4|4.0|My 11 year old loves Sonic and was excited to get the game.  He says that he liked it, but solved the game after logging in and playing it twice in the same day.  He says that if he creates a new profile he can replay the game, but it would be the same exact game and it has no variations to keep it interesting. IMHO, if you are looking for re-play value, you may think about it before buying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't believe what has to go on in this book.. It's a big twist. I can't wait to read the last book. Loved it!

B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I bought DA season 3 during pre-release just like I had season 1 & 2. The set arrived before the season had finished airing on PBS here in the U.S. so rather than spoil the anticipation, I continued to watch the remaining episodes week by week on TV. I still have not unwrapped these DVDs. First of all there is the shallow treatment of the characters we care about the most, especially the lack of the development of the relationship between Matthew and Mary. Then the plotline gone a-kilter what with poor Sybil, not to mention poor Edith, the introduction of troubled little Rose, the Jimmy and Thomas theme ad infinitum, and finally the coup de grace, the season ending, which takes all the enjoyment out of watching again. How uncreative of them not to figure a better way out of the predicament thrust upon them. I was shocked and felt betrayed as a loyal fan. Except for the continued beauty of the people, settings and costumes, season 3 would hardly be worthy of the Downton Abbey legacy.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I suppose EC still makes records because he can, but not because his heart is in it. The only track that I sort of enjoyed was \\"All of Me\\", but that's a song that you'd have to make an effort to ruin. The rest of this CD is filler, much like his previous studio album, \\"Clapton\\".<br /><br />Eric Clapton has always been a derivative artist, but he's a great musician with an expressive singing voice. But on this record he still mimics Ray Charles, as on \\"Born to Lose\\". Ugh. At least he could give us some guitar playing that reminds us why he's such an important artist with a long and successful career.<br /><br />I will always pay to see Clapton in concert because he puts on a great show, but sadly the days of anxiously awaiting his latest studio work has long past.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Meets my expectations.  I can't wait to hook up my record player and listen to these records.  I grew up listening to The Beatles.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|Excellent movie! Wish they had made a sequel. I would have liked to see them have some close encounters with other aliens.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is very well done and very interesting to see the differences in the classes. This show is very addicting.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Skyfall is an excellent way to celebrate fifty years of Bond.  A non stop action thrilling that starts out in your face and doesn't let up til the closing credits.  I like the fact there are some subtle tip of the caps throughout the movie to the classic Bond movies of old.  Worth a purchase or a rent.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|I've been using this app for my writing, and was really excited about the &quot;email pdf&quot; feature. I expected to be able to save my various pieces in my email so I could work on them at my computer, but of the three Notebook files I've created, I only receive one of them in my email. There is no option to send specific books to my email. Unfortunately, I have to find a new app to use new, because I cannot risk losing my data and not being able to send the files to myself, as this app implies.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its addicting and fun, and most of challenging. My daughter got me hooked on this game and so I cant put it down.
B001EC0OMW|5.0|One of the best &#34;Dracula&#34; movies in the Hammer studio line-up.  A must see.  Essential to any collector of vampire movies.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product.  It is a perfect fit and works like it should, and the price was very reasonable!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is a rather complicated novel, one joyously so, but have paper and pan handy to keep track of the myriad characters.  This is a novel of loss, discovery, history, evil, appearances, love and fairy tales, told by several women over many generations from England to Australia and back again.  While complicated, it does eek almost plausible despite the many coincidences along the way.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Finally, there's an app that minics youtube on my desktop. I've tried sooooo many youtube apps, and none come close to this one. I can access my saved videos and subscriptions which I couldn't do with other apps. Love, love, love this app!

B000FC12C8|5.0|\\"The Intelligent Investor\\" really impressed me with the clarity and simplicity of explaining the basics of investing. The other simple and practical book which I just read [[ASIN:B00BLJ61HK Make Money In BRIC Stocks: How to Invest in Emerging Markets]] is about the basics of modern global investing. To a large degree it is based on Graham's principles: know what you are buying and take time to evaluate assets. The first edition of Graham's \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" was published in 1949. It is really interesting to see that the fundamental valuation principles outlined in this book are as applicable these days to technology companies from emerging markets as they were back 60 years ago to US Blue Chips. I would strongly recommend \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" to anyone who really wants to understand this topic and become a successful private investor in the modern days of global opportunities
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer my niece was playing it at a cell phone store and she loved it so much I download it for her and I play more then she do. Good game.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|A must if you love the Beatles.  One of their best albums. Outstanding. Rocketed them into stardom.  All great hits.
B005S39YGU|5.0|Once you start watching these guys, you cannot get enough.  Hooray for Sheldon and his gang. This will get you laughing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is an such amazing game . I think tht everyone should ply it. It is the best game in the whole wide world
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The first time I played this game I was a little lost, there is so much going on.  The hints definitely helped.  Seems like sometimes u have to go from one place in the game to another place many clicks away, such as from the boarding house to the lake house.  A couple of times I could not figure out what action was needed, it kept taking me back to that item, like the faucet.  I guess that's part of the challenge in playing the game.  I have spent many hours playing this game, I'm on my third time through it.  Very good value for the money.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|The Cd is pretty good been long time since we had new music,jimi is still way ahead of his time !!!!
0307704513|5.0|Jason Fried has a refreshing view of working &#34;simply and smartly&#34; to accomplish great things. He values personal time to recharge and accomplish even more. This book is highly recommended for &#34;workaholics&#34; to illustrate that there is a much better way.
B006UV8DJS|5.0|This is such a great app. It won't crash your kindle that's just someone else's experience you have algal kinds of effects to use to!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|best horse sim game i have found so far. 4 stars only though due to the massive reliance on real money through purple gems
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is a very easy read but also very enjoyable. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00846WWVM|4.0|I think this is a great game for anyone but especially for families with children.<br />I don't have children, but enjoy playing it a lot. It's not violent and each level presents a new challenge.
B00785P2QC|5.0|So far so good. Just started playing so I don't know what else to write. If it sucks I'll let you know
B003M696QS|4.0|In a &#34;Darwinian&#34; viewed universe, some of the questions that remain unanswered is consciousness. Specifically, human consciousness. If, everything in the universe is the result of 'time + chance' how can human consciousness be developed, trusted and verified.<br />Add in this scientific look at consciousness beyond clinical death and the walls of naturalistic materialism thought break down farther.<br /><br />Dr. van Pommel has no hard answers (as if there can be any) but offers a thorough, academic investigation into the phenomena leaving the reader no options other than to ignore it or change what they think about what comes after physical death (and it may change your views of your religious affiliation!)
B0087JTAKW|2.0|Very light reading. Fantasy type story. Appreciating one's time on Earth always important. If you like Album great, otherwise never mind.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Easy to install, easy to record and apply macro's. Only gripe is that after a week of using it, the joystick nob started sticking in whatever direction i pushed it.<br />I just put a single drip of wd40 in it and moved it around, fixed it right away.<br />So other then that, i am pleased and would recommend this.
0823015033|4.0|I'm not terribly into polymer clay, although I've dabbled in it from time to time. Instead, this is an excellent book for the beginning sculptor of the human figure in any medium, giving good, practical lessons, not only in forming human features, but for the proportions and math surrounding them. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because, for the intended audience, it assumes a little bit too much experience, the usual, &#34;Here, take five minutes to...&#34; and it would take a beginner about an hour and five or six tries to do the same thing! Overall, though, the illustrations and photos are top notch.
B00000JBFW|5.0|Perfect stranger, one of the best albums of Deep Purple!!! Greats songs, great sound!!! Perfect Stranger, Perfect album! check it out!
B007U8U1V8|5.0|Jack can't stop finding new ways of amazing his audience....I definately waited too long to purchase...shame on me, don't make my mistake, each song a treat!
B007REV4YI|4.0|It's not the best James Bond movie in my view, I prefer the another two, but It's a good movie, and the edition it's cool!
B00B2064IY|5.0|Kramer brings Jimi back for another encore performance!  Nothing Jimi has touched ever fails to amaze and this collection is no exception!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Enjoyed show for historical representations, character development. Interesting to see how people thought in those days.  I like the characters and look forward to following their lives.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This should win awards for the best documentary of 2013.  A must see for music fans and those that want to be enlightened.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|my wife is a state forest ranger and she always needs a tool in her work. i bought this as a valentine present for her. now she has just about anything she needs for her work.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This seiko automatic watch it means a lot to me . It's so cool and so classic and sport .
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I haven't finished playing this yet but wanted to review it at this point. It is so far one of the<br />top five of this genre game I have played. The graphics are the best I've seen - beautiful!!<br />The creators of this game really put effort into the overall package. Story line is interesting<br />and it is not so hard you get frustrated and there is help if needed. Well done!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Gr8 extra's awesome Packaging Worth every cent. If ur a real big bat fan then this is a must have.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game overall and It reminds me of the old SimCity games you will love this game if you like the old SimCity games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love downton abbey.  I like stories taking place in other time periods.  It gives us a glimpse into what life was like many years ago.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book left me wit a smile on my face.......  I would recommend for reading pleasure...... just found me a new author I like
B000NYT1M6|5.0|it is the best toy I have seen. it teaches kids about things in the real world and lets them have fun at the same time
B0014DW3OS|5.0|If you like Denzel Washington movies you'll love this, it also has old skool Dr DRE and Snoop Dog, this movie is a good reality check of the contrast between justice in the courtroom and justice in the streets
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh has been a favorite of mine ever since he started.  I love his voice.  All That Echoes is wonderful.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|both my husband and I read the book and wanted to see how they portrayed the animals and island and the ocean. we both enjoyed the movie.
0790729369|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie, saw it many times, now i have it, cant wait to see it. very happy with the ordering, will order again from the sender.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app is the weather watcher's dream!  I mean it.  You can find out what the weather is in any part of the world.  This app gives you an hour by hour run down on the current weather and also the future weather for, if I remember right, a 16 hour period.  Also it gives you a 7 day weather forecast locally and, again I hope I remember this right, worldwide.  I can't give all the specifics of the app because I jusy started using the app today, but I had to pull myself away from it after I began trying it out.  See for yourself, you can't beat it for the price...FREE!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great for kids would regimens for any pressing with small children they will love. Ours snatched it time and again
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are intriguing and multi-faceted. The location is breathtaking and the costuming is a feast for the eyes. We can't stop watching episode after episode.
B000I9YWDO|2.0|it was just plain boring to me...couldn't wait for it to finish. i cant ever get that time back. lol
B009FZFONO|5.0|zombie fans unite,this is one show you will love, acting is good and story line is like more what would actually happen, hate when some of the main acters get knocked off but that is what would happen in  real life, the ups and down of thier lives keeps you coming back, but tell me how come nobody in zombie shows ever watched a zombie  movie?
B007JMW46U|5.0|I confess to going on a reading binge of Sherlock stories after watching the BBC show Sherlock. Though I read some of them many years ago as a young girl, I never truly appreciated the brilliance until I went back and read them all.<br /><br />There's a reason why Sherlock Holmes stories are still so popular today, in all their forms (movies, TV shows, adaptations, you name it). If you're a fan of brilliant logic and twisty detective stories, Doyle's Holmes stories are still the best out there.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|love the show, wife watchs id channel with all the based on true murders and ths show can make her jump with the twists and turns, has some bloody parts but the acting and inner acting with each other will keep you coming back for more
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Let's start by saying that Martin's writing is perhaps unparalleled in the fantasy world. The intricacy and complexity of his novels and the story he weaves from the viewpoint of multiple characters is incredible.<br /><br />As to the book, I'm not going to summarize as I'm sure there are other reviews that do that. All I'm going to say is, while it's a great book, it isn't for the weak of heart or stomach. There are some very harsh realities and the amount of incest, backstabbing, and general debauchery is astounding. The best way to describe this series is to say reading it is akin to watching a trainwreck occur in front of you. You don't want terrible things to happen, but happen they do, and you can't help but keep reading out of morbid curiosity. This isn't a feel-good novel. None of the Game of Thrones books are. But they are unmistakably real, consistently full of twists, and endlessly entertaining.<br /><br />I'd dock a star for the outrageous pricing (I understand this is a popular book but I have a great hatred for publishers who insist on pricing e-books at eight or nine dollars apiece, or more), but this isn't the place to review pricing. 5 stars for the book, 1 star for the idiot publisher pricing on a Kindle book. Get with the times, Random House, and stop overcharging people for something that has little overhead cost.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Good story, but some of the scenes became repetitive.  Hard to believe some of the scenarios...police never intervened?  Not realistic.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Why these songs dont get more radio play is a crime.  I havent taken this cd out of my player in my car in over a month.  I had only heard Burn title track on the radio before.  It is different then classic DP but Coverdale and Hughes vocals are outstanding.  I am not even a Coverdale fan but he is great on every song.  It is a more bluesy soulful sound then with Ian Gillian.  I recommend listening to this cd 3 or 4 times in a row and u will be hooked.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very good read. One that you just can't put down. I was very surprised at the end of the book. But loved how that was all put together.  Just goes to show you don't know the whole story on how far love can go.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Awesome songs.  Best album so far. Hours of good listening. I recommend it highly. I love every song on this album.
B000068OCS|5.0|Most beautiful audio visual achievement.<br />The impact is tremendous but like all works of art you either like it or you don't.<br />Very moving to watch and the message is sensitive and forceful at the same time.<br />Loved it.<br />Nanice Wassef
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|Although this can be slow to gain rewards in, it is simple and enjoyable for my 4 year old son. He likes to collect the coins, chop down trees and fight spiders, snakes and skeletons! If you're prepared to buy coin and gem packs to progress quicker you can, or you can slowly progress through. I personally am happy to let my son play without having to spend money. He enjoys it as it is :).
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I'm really enjoying this series.  Even though the books are quite long, I'm never ready for them to end!  They are extremely well-written.  The author makes me feel like I'm there with the characters, who are so well developed I forget they're not real! There are plenty of plot twists to keep you reading far into the night!  And the history seems pretty accurate, right down to the smells!  Can't wait to start the next book....
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and fast.  Challenging but not to the point of being unable to play and enjoy, Glad I finally downloaded.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because it is kid friendly.<br />fun. Awesome. Updating makes the game a lot more fun. Funny and fun to explore.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am very glad that I bought this series, because when I watched the previous two series on tv they were completely ruined by the large number of commercials interrupting the story and completely destroying the continuity of this wonderful show. I now know that the episodes run uncut for fifty minutes. but on tv it runs for seventy minutes which means they are showing twenty minutes of commercials in a fifty minute program. I know they need threir sponsers, but this is ridiculously annoying. Thank you for allowing me to have pleasure of watching one of the few shows nowadays worth watching on tv without interruption.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|The novel intersperses historical events and customs with characters and their families over hundreds of years.  Well-written and moving, this novel pulls the reader in and holds one.  Hard to put down.
0393061310|4.0|Interesting topic and some fun facts. Very similar to third chimpanzee and collapse. Definite repeat of facts but still worthwhile
B00A6L78TY|5.0|True, The Stones, The VU, Dylan, and others (Shuggie Otis!) are pretty clearly stolen from on this album. However, Foxygen do it so skillfully and playfully that it comes off as totally acceptable. And behind the very apparent influence-worship are two budding songwriters who I think may have a lot more to give us as they mature. Credit is also due to Richard Swift for the excellent production.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book has some surprise twists in it,making it a little different for a Nicholas Sparks' novel.  He is one of my favorite authors.  Loved this book (loved the movie).
B004I4H8QS|2.0|Disappointed..no good songs except Layla. It was my fault. I was expecting long version of the song. Instead, mixture of the group.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excelente app para leer palabra de Dios en todo momento; las versiones incluidas en español para leer ofline permiten el estudio bíblico sin que sea necesario la conexión a internet.
B005CRQ3LG|4.0|My son loved this book in its print version, but not as much as an e-book. There was nothing exceptional about it, but it is a fun book for kids to read. The best thing about the print version, the bold colors, doesn't seem to translate very well to the electronic version.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I was never a fan of Zombie Movies until now. This is a well written show with characters who make you feel connected to what's going on. Great work by all involved.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is better than other weather apps. Knock on wood -I have had no issues with it.  I use it on my Kindle Fire and, of course, have the advantage of a large display. I have found Accuweather to be more accurate than the other popular weather predictions. The app is quick and easy with everything you need or want to know with a touch of a button.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It's building up for something big in future books, the main characters are aligning and the new characters are only improving the background
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I play it every day.Sometimes I play it every day.It is so fun.If u r a horselover than u will love this game!
B009NX409M|5.0|It was a nice older love story..I would tell all my family and friend to watch..it is a movie I could watch over and over..
B009IEXKXI|4.0|enjoyed reading how the main character got himself out of scrape after scrape.  the science and engineering sounded plausible to me.  kept me reading.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|From the minute I Downloaded this App I loved it..accurate & the alerts even alerted me last night regarding falling temps & the potential for black ice if out driving last night..can set different locations etc..
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Played it much longer than I thought I would. Not as stunned by the soundtrack as other raters but the game is worthy of 5 even without.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the story because numerous characters are introduced so rapidly that I couldn't keep them straight. HOWEVER, the story gathers speed quickly and the characters soon solidified so that they were recognisable to me.  This book soon became hard to put down. Rowling's writing is superb as usual.  Good plot twists, too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought this was a great read.  It offered insight in to the mind of a member of the world's most eleite fighting force.  The way he told the stories was like you were sitting at a bar having a beer with him.  I really enjoyed this book and I didn't feel that any secrets were given away.  This novel is not kind to our current president so I think that is where some of the bad publicity maybe coming from.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Let me just say that this was top rate science fiction, with a very detailed and believable story and a protagonist with a really good sense of humor.  I highly recommend this book.  Don't get too hung up on the scientific details.  Just go with it and enjoy.
0743270754|5.0|This work is very detailed yet it reads like a novel.  It gives excellent insight into the workings of Lincoln and his cabinet.  The movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; is based on a very short period in his life and this period is also covered in &#34;Team of Rivals.&#34;
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I had hoped that since twitter is a short form media style it would be simple to make a great app that included all the content that's on the site. This is not the case. There are no buttons to expand and see media on tweets. There aren't buttons to see what the person you're following is responding to so it appears to be random tweets made out of context. This ruins the heart of the twitter experience which is the links and connections between everyone you can see. Try another app for twitter. I am
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Their are a few songs that I LOVED right off the bat.  I am sure once I listen to them a little more I will find even more favorites!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What a great read.  It helps to have read the first book Fall Of Giants first. The stories and characters are woven together throughout both books. It makes learning the history of 2 world wars more interesting and understandable. Great books. He's quite the author.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|first time bond looks dumb.i see all bond movie i am disappoint from this movie.story ok but not best movie.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I recommend watching this movie with your entire family. Especially with the little ones. It is a fun filled family adventure with a loveable bear who makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Make sure to smoke pot during this film.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I found the story very disturbing but after living in a former Soviet country for 18 months, couldn't stop reading the book. I found it a fascinating and insightful narrative about Soviet thinking.  I believe the author &#34;gets into the head&#34; of a Soviet security officer and captures the &#34;why&#34; of his profession. Many of the beliefs that Leo, the main character, had (he changes his communist thinking along the way),  are still evident in the former Soviet Union countries today. Be aware, some of the chapters are filled with gruesome details that are definitely not for the tender-hearted or those who are mentally unstable.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I like watching this movie because it looks pretty and i like pretty stuff to look at. It is not scary or anything like people may tell you. It is a tale of a tall white man and how he wants to oppress earth because he messed up on his science project. He's going to kill everyone on earth because ...eff us..that's why. Black goo, androids and Noomi. Sexual intercourse alien impregnation. Squid like face hugger.  Space ships and black dudes.
B00992CF6W|2.0|do not try to download and uninstal the app did not open for me after that and now app shows that it is installed but it wont open
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I felt that this prepare you for owning a real horse. Brock ,  just brovo. You might want to give a little more action. KK. Any thing else? Hahaha. :-)
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I just love this series.  It was even cooler than I thought it would be with the cute little carrying case and the added booklets.  It reminds me of the old barbie carrying cases.  Fun times.
B00005JMCT|5.0|this one gets funnier and funnier everytime this cast comes together. definitly my type of humor. i almost got the entire set
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love the movie so I had to own it.  Hubby downloaded the digital copy and now watches it on his iPod touch.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|who could ever get tired of this movie. its one for the ages a very powerful fantasy ride of what its like to find your passion and what you would do for love and believing in the good in people etc plus the music and dances are just soooo dreamy
B00571F26Y|4.0|Book is full of information.  Tends to be a little too scientific but the author skillfully breaks info down for the layperson.  Would like to check out the cookbook.
B000HT386M|5.0|a very nice story.I love most adams movies anyway but it reminds you of the imports of life and family and love
B004IDG97S|3.0|Okay, so I'm a Dredd fan. I watched the new version that came out in 2012 and decided to resurrect this dinosaur. It's cheesy. It's got over the top acting, and the only part of the comics it does follow is that there's a Judge named Dredd and he has a brother named Rico. If you're a Judge Dredd fan, watch it. It's not terrible. It's not great either! For example, the Judges Council consits of Judges from different eras of the comic - all in one place! And the one that actually was the savior for Mega-City One turns out to be the bad guy! Just makes you wish producers and writers would actually READ the stuff they base their movies on instead of throwing it out and making a B-Movie with it. I mean you have a pretty good cast: Max Von Sydow, Armen Assante, and...that weenie guy from Deuce Bigalow (who plays comic relief). If you consider yourself a SERIOUS Judge Dredd fan and haven't seen this piece of garbage, then STAY AWAY! But if you're looking for an amusing flick that may give you some ideas for the Judge Dredd RPG, then check it out. Either way, I watched it three times during the rental period.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|The controls are super confusing and hard to use. I set it on the mode where animals would only attack if harmed and I was killed three times by a bull. I didn't even touch the bulls. I deleted this after one minute because it was impossible to use. Don't get it or the real one. It's a waste. Get the mine craft pocket edition. It is so much better. The ONLY good thing about this game are the graphics. That is why I'm giving it two stars. Don't get this.
B0095DC07Y|5.0|Very nice, hope to see the rest of ELP re-issued the same way.In times when prog-rock is loosing it's position-it was very important to remind everybody how great some things were,are and always will be.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I absolutely am in love with these books....the authors every word comes down to one meaning and at the end of the series you will know just what im talking about!!!
0316227706|4.0|Cute, funny and comical pictures! No words, just pictures of swimming, diving dogs! Enjoyable by all ages, yound and old! Great gift idea!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|fabulous drama, writing and sophisticated humor- the acting is as high quality as only the great British can give us. great TV
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|This was my first time watching this. I enjoyed it. However, if you're a big follower of The Phantom of the Opera, there are going to be a few things that stick out like sore thumbs.. The main one being That Christine's child is really The Phantom's and not Raouls... It makes since to me with how ALW writes the story. I can see it annoying others though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very easy and time consuming. Keeps me entertained as well as my 4 year old. Graphics are decent and you are able to skip tasks for a price.
B004I2K4E8|3.0|This kind of annoyed me. I had the wrong idea when I made this purchase. I thought it was an actual stage production. It definitely not. They come on stage and sing in front of microphones in full costume.. This was my first time seeing, or attempting, to see the stage production. So I'm extremely disappointed...
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Completely ridiculous...every major character should have died about six times...and the ending literally made me say, &#34;What?....WHAT???&#34; Don't waste your money buying this like I did.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Listened to the book on CD several years ago and thought it was mostly boring. This was pretty good. The ending may be a bit much for children if they understand what really happened.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|If you are not a foriegn film person it will not matter. This movie transcends that issue and you may end up looking to more in the future.  A wonderful feel good movie about two unlikely people becoming great freinds. So simple and so wonderful. If more people in the world were like this what a world it could be. ENJOY
B004WN96ME|5.0|am a big fan of megadeth and have always love there music and this is the best album music ever, buy it if you can and you will like it.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|i real ly liked the pack aging and the qua lity of the inner box and liners/ fast mail service
B004V6MWFU|4.0|The first time I heard Eddie sing solo was \\"The Long Road\\" on \\"Dead Man Walking\\" soundtrack.  His deep moans and cries are soul-stirring , and one might imagine, they could be heard by excecutioners in Steve Earle's \\"Ellis Unit\\" -- was it # 1 ?  Upon receiving our family 2013 income tax return, manna from IRS, I purchased Eddie's c.d., \\"Ukulele Songs.\\"  The last time I heard extraordinary music like this was around 1968, artists Tiny Tim and Miss Vicky, and I wish Tiny was still around to do a duet with Vedder, and \\"dream a little yellow ledbetter-dream.\\"
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The best season ever!!! David Tennant and Catherine Tate, you can;t get any better.<br />Voyage of the Dammed: starts the season with a bang, great, great, the three best parts are when the Doctor says I'am the Doctor, A time lord, I'am 900 years old, I'm from Galifray and I'm the one who is going to save your lifes and the earth. the next part was the KISS, and the next one was the snap of the fingers and the angels take the Doctor up the the bridge to meet Alonzo and save the ship and Earth.<br />Partners in Crime: great - the two best parts were the silent speech from across the room between the Doctor and Donna, just so funny, couldn;t stop laughing. The next part was when the Doctor told Donna, &#34;I just want a Mate&#34;, and Donna misunderstood and said &#34;you'r not mateing with me, sunshine&#34;<br />The fires of Pompaii - excellent, the best parts were when the Doctor realized he was the one who caused the eruption and him and Donna decide to do it together to make history right.  The next one was when Donna made the Doctor go back and save at least one family, and how the Doctor admited he needed someone to keep him from going to far.<br />Planet of the OOD: This episode was so good in so many way;s, I just can't go through all of it, a 10 star episode. Must watch!<br />The Sontaron strategen, & poisen sky: - The Doctor, Donna, Martha Jones, Wilford, and Unit, great!<br />The Doctor's Daughter: The Doctor gets a Daughter and then loses her - sad - more glimpes into the Doctor's past.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it sooo much it is an amazing game that every one will love it boom goes the dynamite.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|fun game, takes time to get use too, doesn't give enough driving time though, try it, its addictive, remember to use your brakes
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down it was so good and intriguing. I don't like many love stories but this one was really good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this! What a wake up call! It really did put some heat back into my marriage. In our 50's, married 11 years and things are hotter and more intimate than they have ever been. This is perfect women's erotica. Just enough story to keep our heart involved, and just enough sex to keep you wanting to read more.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It brought back actual events from my past..am glad I was able to get out while I had the chance...Loved the book, but it went into someone else's life and I was lost
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|it is really fun to play but tricky to steer your car and the time limmits are hard to beat
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I actually bought the game for my daughter and I ended up playing it more than her. The game is a lot of fun and you really don't even have to pay any extra money to enjoy. The only problem I've had is that when there are updates the game won't open again and all my progress was erased because I had to reinstall the game but I liked it so much I didn't mind starting over.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I love fight movies, so it's not a surprise I liked this one - but even I have to admit that this particular film has a little bit more going for it than just fighting. The acting is superb and the storyline is absolutely excellent. My entire family loved this movie and that's really saying something. This movie very quickly earned it's place in my top ten favorite movies of all time. Definitely recommend. As for the blu-ray, this is a quality disc and looks great in 16:10 widescreen. I don't feel the need to own a lot of movies. After netflixing this I had to go out and buy it. Will watch again.
0553801473|2.0|The first three books of this series were phenomenal, but somehow George R.R. Martin's efforts were derailed, and the latest two books took a turn for the (much) worse. GRRM's original plan was to have the stories in AFFC and ADWD run coincidentally, and then have ADWD move forward after the first 600 pages or so. They were also originally planned to be released only about a year apart, however Book 5 wasn't released for another SIX YEARS after Book 4's release.<br /><br />There are so many problems with these books, it seems unlikely that many of them will be resolved with just another 2,000 or 3,000 pages. There is so much weird, extraneous activity going on, that is just left in limbo for hundreds of pages, that it's difficult to follow what is happening in some of the storylines, and even if you can trace back to the previous chapter, it's often still unclear what's going on. This is exacerbated by the prevalent style in AFFC, in which a chapter will begin with some astounding revelation about a character or an unexpected event that's completely non-continuous with the character's previous narration, after which GRRM fills us in on what happened in the meantime. This is done so often that it becomes cliche and annoying. I'm wondering if there is a version of \\"Cliffs Notes\\" out there so I can figure out what I just read!<br /><br />Also, so many new characters are introduced that often we feel like we're reading a different series. These characters can leave us disengaged as we wait to get back to the characters that we know and care about. There are so many loose ends that leave us confused, or happened so long ago we've forgotten the characters (What about that poisoning in Oldtown? What ever happened to Sam? 500 pages and nothing about Bran? 600 pages without Davos? 3000 pages without Rickon?) We're always waiting for some sort of resolution, some payoff, and it almost never comes.<br /><br />You can start to see how the HBO series \\"Game of Thrones\\" has deftly begun editing out many, many superfluous characters, events and storylines, and they have actually IMPROVED the story by drastically improving the pacing...and that's just in their version of Book 2. Imagine how much they'll have to trim the remainder of the books to make them manageable and INTERESTING.<br /><br />The storylines also move much more sluggishly in Books 4 and especially 5, with much bantering and arguing, and endless self-reflection and doubt. It's fitting that much of the action occurs on a slow river, as the word \\"meander\\" comes from the winding river, Meandros. The paragraphs-long descriptions of every single person's attire has always been frustrating to the storyline, but it's taken to new heights in these latest two books. Helpful Hint: If you start reading about someone's sigil, or see an endless list of knights you've never heard of and will never read about again, or read the words ermine, sable, lace, buttons, boots, etc, then skip to the next paragraph.<br /><br />And plots: people die and are brought back later. People thought dead aren't really dead. Many themes and gimmicks are recycled. I totally agree with another reviewer when they said \\"GRRM has gone to the same well a few too many times.\\" Characters you've been following since the very first few pages are killed off, and you get to the point where you think, \\"Gee, I wonder WHEN s/he is going to be revived and \\"surprise\\" us in the future...\\"<br /><br />If you listen to the audiobooks, you know that actor and GRRM friend Roy Dotrice did the narration for Books 1-3 and 5. He did a pretty good job with the first 3, changing voices as best he could (I especially like his Scottish Tyrion), but on Book 5 his voice has become noticeably older, slower and less flexible. His deep and sultry voice for Melisandre in the earlier books changed in ADWD to sound like all the other women he's tried to imitate: a Yorkshire leprechaun. And that leprechaun voice is so ridiculous and distracting whenit is used for such \\"beautiful\\" women as Cersei and Danaerys.<br /><br />The bottom line: Books 4 and 5 are very long. Things do happen, but very slowly, and I'm just hoping GRRM will be able to finally finish the series before he dies. We've been told he's up to seven books, and there are hints of maybe EIGHT OR NINE. He's not getting any younger, he's morbidly obese and most certainly sleep apneic , and these tomes take a long time to write, so we'll just have to see!it is used for such \\"beautiful\\" women as Cersei and Danaerys.<br /><br />The bottom line: Books 4 and 5 are very long.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is so fun. you can drive all day long on super adventures. you can create your own character and car.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Start with Season 1 or you won't appreciate the dynamics of the family - which includes the servants.  Wow Wow Wow
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This is an excellent collection for Harry Potter fans. I got the Blu-ray disks, and if you like behind the scenes extras, then this is the set for you - more than enough to satisfy any.<br />Well worth the price!
B008Y6SLL2|5.0|Good storyline, good acting, everyone should see this movie (I need a head to feed the traders when market opens)
B0072OFM28|4.0|This 2nd season is almost as good as the first - plenty of action, plenty of gore, and the women that men like to watch.<br />  But there are a couple of things I didn't like. First, almost all of the action scenes would go into slow motion for a few seconds, then continue in normal speed, then back into slo-mo again, and again, which was a BIG distraction!<br /> The second was the new Navia, Crixus' lover. The original Navia was played by Lesley-Ann Brandt, but she was replaced by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, who just is not as pretty as Lesley, and I never could accept her as Navia.<br />  The original Spartacus, played by Andy Whitfield, who unfortunately died, was replaced by Liam McIntyre, who does an admirable job. No complaints about him once I got used to the new Spartacus..<br />  Many of your favorites are back - Lucretia, Doctore, Crixus, Mira, Ilithyia, and Ashur. And there are quite a few new characters to get to know.<br />  Buy this DVD set? Certainly, if you were a fan of the first season.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is very fun and challenging, trying to anticipate the paths and avoid being eaten at the same time is downright<br />terrifying and fun.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|If you like blood, gore, more gore, even more gore, beheadings and chopped off limbs, and undressed slave and Roman women. Buy it!
B003097B64|5.0|A must have for any Little Feat fan. I only wish they had included  Waiting For Colombus to make this the perfect collection<br />ect collection
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am going to go see Wicked in a few weeks so I decided to buy the c.d and it is AMAZING. You will find yourself humming and singing these songs constantly. The Highlights of the c.d for me were of course the ever popular &#34;Popular&#34;, &#34;Defying Gravity&#34; A.K.A Idina Menzel's belt-fest, and the extremely catchy &#34;Dancing Through Life.&#34; There are many other song that are great too. Buy this c.d you will not regret it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Ok so my husband and son said I would love this game. I do, LOL! We now play at least one game after dinner every night before the dishes are cleared. Sometimes it gets to be two or three games. Great family fun!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie ended with a man asleep on the beach and I think that is fitting as it will certainly put it's audience asleep.  Loosely based on cult leader L Ron Hubbard but no where near as entertaining as scientology. PT andersen has made great films but this is not one of them. Slow and Pointless \\" The Master\\" should be more acurately titled \\" The Mundane\\"
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell's novels.  Kay Scarpetta is a terrific main character!  Great read as usual.  Intrigue and interesting story.
B000MV8XPG|2.0|I was excited when I put it together. I bought it for a three year old grandson but he didn't seem as enthused. It is a bit difficult to work the handles. Only one handle moves; the other is stationary. It is a little difficult for a three year old to figure out. And he keeps think he can put his feet on the wheel base for support, but that doesn't work out either. It is a bit wide for him to stradle. It looks like it would be easy to walk around with it, but it isn't. If I had to do again, I won't buy it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a must read.  This book is very poignant and shows just how difficult life as a Navy Seal can be on one's family and personal psyche.  Chris Kyle was torn between being a family man and the best Sniper America has ever seen.  He was a devoted Seal all the way to the day his life was abruptly ended by someone who he was trying to help.  That was his mission after leaving the Seals.  He is an American Hero.
B008L1F91A|5.0|love the new look of these statues cant wait till the rest of them are released.would recommend to anyone whoes a justice league fan
B00B0NDF26|4.0|This CD has a lot of good music. Seems strange to rate a CD though. You usually know what you're getting beforehand (thanks YouTube)
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this story. A fun love story full of sadness and heartbreak-but not the kind I expected . I felt connected to the characters.
0790731452|4.0|I bought this for my fianc&eacute; because he wanted this movie. Everything was fine with the order, it came when it was supposed to tho it was late shipping.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I don't have to tell you how good the show is if you're getting season two, because you just know.  So story aside I will tell you that this season's blu-ray version is wonderful.  I haven't gotten into the commentary yet, but I can tell you one thing that makes these a &#34;must own&#34;.  That one thing is the wonderful in episode guide.<br /><br />Having read the books I know some of the back story, but it's great to be able to pull it up while you're watching to refresh yourself with where the characters are and who they are.  If that wasn't enough then you get the wonderful history or Westeros retold to you in these beautifully narrated shorts that are nothing short of wonderful.  Aside from the in episode guide, enough cannot be said about how beautiful the video transfer is.<br /><br />I watch this show on my TV when it broadcasts on HBO, and it looks wonderful there.  A couple months later I get it on blu-ray and I don't know how they do it, but it looks even more visually stunning.  The colors pop, everything is crystal clear, and the blacks are to die for dark.  So what are you waiting for go ahead, and buy this on blu-ray.  If you don't have the first buy that one as well.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great book, written by an insider, when I started reading I could not put it down...it was that goood..
