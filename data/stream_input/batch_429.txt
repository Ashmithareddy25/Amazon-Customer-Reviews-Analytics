B00001ZT6Z|4.0|OK Sabbath is a band that, let's face it, unless you are a true Metal fan, most people assume either stopped or sucked after Ozzy departed.  I think most people reading this that that is certainly not the case.  After the Dio era, Tony Martin came in to fill the shows once occupied by Ozzy and Dio and that's nopt easy.  So for a moment let's pretend Ozzy and Dio never uttered a note in this band and take \\"Headless Cross\\" and listen to it on its own and judge it on its own merits.  This is solid metal with operatic vocals and demonic lyrics that outdo anything that came before.  I bought this CD for $5.00 and wow.  I took the attitude I was listening to a band distinct from the \\"other Sabbaths\\" and was blown away.  It may not be their best, but is worthy of anyone's metal collection.
B00005BL2A|1.0|Why did Depeche Mode release this? Were they desperate for cash? Was this a contractural obligation? Were they actually convinced that the songs on here were not crap? This album came out around the same time U2 shocked us all with the fantastic \\"All that you can leave behind,\\"  and when Madonna released \\"Music\\". At least they showed us that '80s artists could still swing it with the rest of them. Depeche Mode should have been like them but for some reason, they released this dull drivel. Such a wasted opportunity to embrace new fans. The tour for this album was crap too. Oh well, at least they didn't go hip hop.
B0000251VS|5.0|This is the best Iron Maiden album ever. I never manage to listen any Iron Maiden CD with Bruce Dickinson from the beginning until the end - just because all songs sound like each other and none of them remains in the memory - its just a &quot;metal chewing gum&quot;! But this one is a masterpeace - I want to listen to it over and over again, and all tunes are constantly in my head. DiAnno RULES !!!!
B000002MJC|3.0|This album shows the damaging effects of peer pressure. Depeche Mode felt pressured to release a rock album to keep up with the Joneses, and it caused their career to take a nosedive. Some would say that \\"Ultra\\" is when they \\"jumped the shark\\" (a term used to describe when a TV show does something stupid to cause the entire ship to go down), and others would even say \\"Violator\\" was the beginning of the end, but I think it started here. From here on out this group tries so hard to have a rock edge, and really, the rock thing ONLY worked with the songs \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Pleasure, Little Treasure.\\" Everything else sounds like some lame lounge psuedo-blues band.  <br /> <br />However, if you absolutely MUST buy this album, do so for the following songs: <br /> <br />\\"Condemnation\\" (universally hated, but I cannot understand why) <br />\\"One Caress\\" ( another Martin Gore classic ballad with gorgeous vocals and an actual orchestra) <br /> <br />\\"Rush\\" is okay but buy this album for the above songs and leave the rest on as background music.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This is the &quot;Best Album of 2004&quot;. Anastacia makes you feel every emotion with this album. Her voice alone will take you to places you've never been. America needs to open up and stop buying the junk thats out there with these pop artists and spend their money on quality music like Anastacia.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|At least Vanilla Ice wasn't pretentious. What was \\"8 Mile\\" all about? Do you really think that lame \\"revelation\\" at the end would actually work in a rap battle? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! No. Here's something that will work: puberty. Will your voice ever change? Bottom line: It doesn't matter how many black guys you pull in from the street, you're still Eminem at the end of the day, and that's sad.
B000001GQT|3.0|Karajan's account of Zarathustra is too solemn, tempos are too slow. Zarathustra is supposed to be a joyous work, a revelation to mankind of new truths, an occasion for celebration. Instead, this recording too often sounds like a wake. Reiner's 1954 recording captures the right spirit. And at 31+min, it's also a full 4min faster.
B000002L9M|4.0|\\"Black Celebration\\" sticks out as the gothic album of the Depeche Mode catalog. It's dark, melodic, ethereal and even upbeat on its down moods (A Question of Time). Ask any Depeche Mode fan what their favorite top 3 albums from this band are, and I guarantee you this one will be among the the three.
0790729342|5.0|George Miller's sequel to the Australian hit film 'Mad Max' takes us to the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Australian Outback where our hero must choose between defending the last shreds of civilized life or plunge himself into the depraved depths of anarchy.    Although the opening scene in this film starts off where the first one ended, there isn't much continuity between the two films.  The first film is set in a rather civilized setting where Mad Max is exacting revenge on an average biker gang that killed his family.  In the 'Road Warrior' there are no towns or any signs of civilized life other than a small group of squatters holding an isolated oil well and refinery.  The settlers are continuously besieged by hordes of punks/anarchists on bikes and muscle cars who want the installation as a criminal base of operation.  Although at first coming to the settlers as an opportunist only looking for gas, Mad Max finds his humanity and helps the settlers free themselves from their attackers.    This is a great post-apocalyptic film with some of the best car chases ever put on film.  A fast-paced plot with a good script keeps the audience on the edge of their seats until the final showdown.  A great film to own and watch many times.
B000002LK1|5.0|What else could I say that hasn't already been said for over 14 years? This album is essential for any serious music collector. It's phenomenal on all counts! Even if you are not a fan of this genre, the lyrics alone will have you reconsidering your musical tastes. This album was made back in the days when you could listen to a CD from beginning to end without skipping an entire track. Don't trust the sound clips, the BEST songs are definitely the last tracks. Definitely take the plunge and buy this one. If you don't like it, sell it to someone else, but trust me, this is an album that you'll be playing over and over again.
B00005ATQF|4.0|Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film is a two part view of the military as an institution more than about Vietnam specifically.  The film first looks at the institutionalization of soldiers through basic training and, second, how such training develops the characters in actual combat.  The film is more of a system analysis than the symbolic social themes present in 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now.'    The film starts in Paris Island where several Marine recruits undergo basic training.  This is definitely the best part of the film with the great performance of Lee Ermey as the zealous drill instructor.  The film follows how the training affects the recruits psychologically and how they work as a group.  Trainees who perform under par (Vincent D'Onofrio) are soon put at the bottom of the pecking order and are subjected to the abuse of their peers as well the drill instructor.  As for the combat part, there are pluses and minuses.  True, the city didn't really look like Hue and, in light of the huge offensive the North Vietnamese launched on the City, there don't seem to be many corpses littering the streets or any soldiers in the City other than a young girl with an AK.  Even accepting Joker's (Matthew Modine) limited combat experience, the other soldiers themselves look too disorganized and confused to be hardened men who've been in-country for a while now.  I did like Kubrick's brilliant camera work in filming the combat scenes; the cameras aren't fixed in one place at any time: they follow the action briskly with the men as they run, seek cover, etc.    This is a good film to own and watch especially for the first half of the film.  I rate this film with just as much quality and insight as the other two top Vietnam films of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon'.
B00000JCB2|1.0|How this band even existed is beyond me! I was foolish enough to buy this record back in the day, now it collects dust beside my \\"Ace of Base\\" CD. Stupid stupid stupid. I give it 1 star because \\"Nookie\\" has a nice dance beat in between all the shouting by that fat, balding lead singer.
B000083C49|4.0|As I explain in all of my Star Trek reviews, a good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) The even-numbered ones are extremely good while the odd ones (except for the first film which is rather average) are extremely bad. This continuation of Star Trek 2 and 3 directed by Leonard Nimoy himself is a pleasant viewing experience with a great screenplay, decent acting, and good special effects. A film worth owning or at least watching several times. <br />  <br /> Our famous Federation crew starts on Vulcan where Spock has been re-educated in his Vulcan ways after coming back to life on the Genesis planet in Star Trek III. He was of course dispatched in Star Trek II while fighting Kahn. Deprived of the Enterprise, the crew takes off to Earth in their Klingon bird of prey but are interrupted by a mysterious space monolith that is disrupting the Earth's oceans. The Earth is on the verge of destruction and our heroes must go back to 20th century Earth to find the answer. Once on Earth, the crew is in total culture shock with their ancestors' primitive ways. Their mission is soon helped with the reserved guidance of a marine biologist (Catherine Hicks.) Will they come back to the Earth of the future in time to save humanity?  <br />  <br /> This plot is not the action-drama that pervades Star Trek II and VI. Instead, this is more of a science fiction-adventure-comedy with little to no dramatic tension at all. I wouldn't worry too much about the link with Star Trek III because it's simply better to avoid watching that horrible film and accept that Spock just came back to life. A very pleasant film to watch with plenty of comical cultural contrasts between future and past characters and situations; not to mention the perpetual clash of views between Spock and McCoy: &quot;You green-blooded inhuman.&quot; Leonard Nimoy directed this film quite well and the actorsare comfortable in their roles. A fun film for the entire family.
B000000993|5.0|Yeah and their music shows exectly that!With anbiemt sort of songs and heavy at the same time tool impresses here. I love tool and i still will keep on supporting  them and  their music just flows all over while i close my eyes and listing to every single track...Its a rush!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The third and best installement in Sergio Leone's western trilogy involving the characters of Tuco (Eli Wallach), Setenza a.k.a Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and Joe Manco/Blondie/The Man with no Name (Clint Eastwood.)  One of the best-known westerns along with its legendary music composed by Enio Morricone.      As with its two predecessors, it was the last in a series of westerns that broke the traditional good vs. bad cowboy, sheriff v. desperado, plots and themes that dominated virtually every western film to precede it.  The characters are archetypes to set a particular mood of a land immersed in utter lawlessness.  Although Clint Eastwood's character is the hero, he's hardly a model of virtue as a bounty hunter who catches his fugitives only to save them later to increase the bounty.  Lee Van Cleef's character is the total sociopath who needs to keep up his reputation as a reliable hired killer even if it means killing his own employer. Tuco Benedito Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez is the epidemy of the Mexican desperado: instead of being the stern, cold-blooded Angel Eyes, Tuco is the repulsive yet likable bon vivant bandido who's always emotional; like everyone else, he wants all the gold for himself.  The shifting scenes showing the grimy faces and twitching hands of the gun slingers adds to the tension and mood of the film: sheer survival in a very Wild West.  Slow and detailed camera shots revolve around the characters while Morricone's brilliant brass symphonic arrangements make the audience feel as if they're watching a matador preparing to run his sword through a ferocious snarling bull. All of this is presented through close shots of the twitching eyes, dripping sweat, and nervous hands hovering over the grip of a Peacemaker. The humourous treatment of the characters keeps it as a satirical action-adventure western instead of a drama genre.    An excellent film that should be in every western genre lover's collection without exception.  Don't miss watchingone of the greatest westerns ever made.
B00005A46T|1.0|I love slipknot to death and im a huge fan specialy when i seen them at ozzfest but i was let down while listining to ioway because for some reason i just can't get into this album at all. Sure, its heavy,insane and all but i just find myself skippin every track here... I mean, every single track cause it just plain boreds me.  For slipknot that is actullie good ? Get their self title and their latest album vol 3 ( the subliminal versus) dont waste your money on this album.
B0000UJL96|4.0|A good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) In this final motion picture installment of the franchise, director Nicholas Meyer (director of Wrath of Kahn) brings us a dramatic adventure filled with mystery, suspense, and a lot of action.    Parallelling the political mood of 1992 when the US was rapproaching with Russia and Yeltsin, the story starts with the Klingons being on the verge of economic and political capitulation: the film plot is actually similar to the spy thriller 'The Package' starring Gene Hackman. Kirk and his crew have been selected for a diplomatic mission in which they must settle a future peace with the Klingon empire but not every human or Klingon wants peace.  When the Klingon diplomat Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) falls victim to a plot, accusations fly on both sides and Kirk is literally trapped in the middle.  Kirk and his crew must soon work against the machinations of the war-hungry Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) to save the peace.    A great finish for the Star Trek films with a lot of suspense and action.  The script is probably the best along with Wrath of Kahn; using a lot of lines from Shakespeare's plays.  A great film to own or rent.
B00005B36H|5.0|Not like their other albums but still not sucky at all. Infact, i realy realy love this album! The songs are slower and  actullie heavier but still not heavy like the previous albums. I sitll recommend for tool fans out there cause every song on this album is realy good.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|Irvin Kershner directs this 1983 remake of 'Thunderball' with the same Bond actor but without punch.  It's important to note that this is not an Albert Broccolli production and is therefore devoid of the trademark opening scene with the tracking gun barrel and the signature Bond music.  Instead, this production leaves much to be desired with a rather contrived script and bad acting even by Connery.    Just as in 'Thunderball', Bond goes to the Bahamas to investigate the dispearance of a NATO bomber carrying a nuclear payload. Bond soon comes face to face with SPECTER's second in command, Emilio Largo (now played by Klaus Maria Brandauer as opposed to Adolfo Celi) who has a hand in the disappearance of the plane. Bond uses his charm to seduce Largo's mistress, Domino, to stop Largo's and SPECTER's sinister plans.    A very contrived remake that seemed quite self-aware and tongue- in-cheek.  I can't recommend this film since Connery is in both versions and does a much better job in the original one.  This is one Bond worth skipping.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Let me start by saying that the cast was impressive and that was the main reason for watching this movie. How bad could it be? <br /> <br />This movie goes all over the place. The characters are not developed and therefore we are left empty and not caring one bit for these people. One reason I believe we don't connect is that there are way too many couples in this movie. Don't get me wrong the movie has potential but how can we possibly feel for over sixteen people when it's only a two hour movie? <br /> <br />The only couples I feel that needed more attention were: Emma Thompson's charcter and husband, Laura Linney and the guy she had a crush on. If you watch the movie you'll understand why. Emma's character has a stronger story and Laura Linney's character had to deal with an emotionally unbalanced and needy brother. We could have seen more as to how she was going to deal with this and still have a life. <br /> <br />All other characters were wasted and pointless. Such a great cast  <br />wasted on this nonsense.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie does have something of a spin to it. I think most mature American voters are quite capable of discounting the spin and addressing the issues raised, which are important ones; the movie may or may not influence their votes. I found much of what was shown extremely interesting and worth looking for more information about. Other parts of the film I discounted as hyperbole resulting from a passion against a certain political viewpoint. <br />  <br /> But, although the film does have its own slant, it has never been claimed to be more than one man's view of events; it should be understood as such. And any critic who says that in this free country a person expressing a different political view from his own is a traitor has a very distorted view of what the United States is supposed to be about. Mr. Moore has put forward his entry into the &quot;free marketplace of ideas.&quot; People of different views have done the same, and some of them also have opinions of interest. Truly, it is possible for people of honor to be loyal and well-intentioned, yet still to hold different ideas about the policies that would govern this country best. People on each side are entitled to try to win others over to their viewpoints. Personally, I liked the film very much. If some people didn't--hey, free country, right? Right?
B000066NW0|5.0|I'm a professed hardcore Britney Spears fan.  I admit it.  But that doesn't mean I'm not open to other genres of music, and Avril Lavigne's style is in my opinion totally awesome; it's punk but it's pop too, and that sits at a perfect balance of mainstream and not-so-typical.  Her 2002 debut Let Go is a definitely worthwhile entry in today's Britney-hyped music and skyrocked to the top of the charts with her co-penned No. 1 smash \\"Complicated,\\" which kinda became that summer's most popular song.  Every song on this sterling record could be hit and that makes Let Go even more irresistible.  Congrats, Avril...and to quote your song: \\"I'm with you.\\"
6305842442|3.0|I think that I am still relatively safe in saying that Blade Runner is one of the most prolific and inspired sci-fi movies of all time. But there are still several qualms that many people, myself included, have with the DVD release. First of all, the sound and video transfer flat out suck. There is no 5.1 sound, and as for the video, well, that's just because no archival negative has ever been made, so what you see is what you get. Secondly, the only version of the film that you can get on DVD format is the \\"Director's Cut\\", which is just a hurried fix-up from the original. Ridley Scott even said himself that he wasn't totally happy with this version, but it met his basic artistic vision of the film. Lastly, there are not special features except for a crappy cast and crew synopsis. <br />  <br /> Okay, so before you start to think that I'm totally blasting the film, hold on. The true version of this film is yet to be seen by anyone. According to Scott and Warner Bros., a three-disk, definitive version of Blade Runner is supposed to be released. Contained will be all the different versions of the film, including a new version which Scott has painstakingly digitally re-edited and reworked. It's not the original, it's not the director's cut, but it's just simply, \\"Blade Runner\\". Also included in the \\"Blade Runner: Special Edition\\" will be loads of extras, including interviews and documetaries. This is the true version of the movie, the version that should be viewed by the masses. One problem though. Legal struggles between Scott, Warner Bros., and the \\"Blade Runner Partnership\\" have made the release of this version all but certain. Scott has already done the work, and Warner Bros. is ready to distribute, but Jerry Perenchio of the \\"Partnership\\" seems less than thrilled to let Scott have his way. <br />  <br /> So, my advice is to hold out until the \\"Special Edition\\" comes out. I know, who knows when that will be, but trust me, if you are a fan of Blade Runner, you willonly be doing yourself a favor by waiting.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Having seen the Red Hot Chili Peppers live in concert myself, I must say that they are one of the few bands that sound better live than in their albums. This CD does a great job capturing the Red Hot Chili Peppers sound. Flea and John sound amazing. The only minor complaint is there are only a couple pre-Californication tracks on the CD. Only &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Give It Away&quot; made the cut. Other than that minor complaint, this a great live CD from a great live band. Highlights include: &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;Fortune Faded&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Dont Forget Me&quot;, &quot;Brandy&quot;, &quot;Rolling Sly Stone&quot;, &quot;Leverage of Space&quot;, and &quot;Black Cross&quot;.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book as my father lay dying of emphysema. What this book emphasizes is what I experienced: the sacredness of the \\"moment\\" with one you love. This is the gift of the book and the gift of spending time with a father or mother, mentor or friend, as they die. Much of it is challenging, prompting anguish and angst, but all of it is sacred.       This book reflects the experience faithfully. If we attend to those who are dying, they will share their wisdom, for they must. It is a part of the letting go process. They need to comment on their journey, to say goodbye in their own way. So we give them a gift in return: caring. It's what we all pray for when our time arrives to fade away, to move on. We pray that someone will care enough to be there, simply be there, and listen. That's what Mitch Albom did. And that's what we can do, too.      This book is a treasure for that alone. It can serve as a model for others, a guide, a handbook.      But read it also for a glimpse at Morrie's love affair with life and courageous acceptance of death. He paid attention to others all his life, teaching and sharing, dancing to the tunes of life. It was fitting that Mitch paid attention to him when it mattered most, a glorious and graceful tribute, to be sure.      This book is timeless.
B0002TT0NM|5.0|The third movie in the Harry Potter series was by far the best.  Alfonso Cuaron (the director) did a magnificent job.  He is so talented and was able to turn a movie into a film.  When compated with the first 2 movies, directed bu Chris Columbus, The Prisonor of Azkaban has improved visually creating a darker feel more similar to the books.  Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint's acting hsa dramatically changed.  They have all matured so much since the first 2 films.  In POA (prisnor of azkaban) they learned how to develop their characters so much more.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I think it's great that Lucas has decided to release the original trilogy on DVD. I don't mind most of the changes he made in 1997, and the newest changes that supposedly will be on the DVD (only Anakin is being changed in the force ghost scene in Return of the Jedi, and not Obi-Wan). I think, for the most part, they help blend with the prequel trilogy better. Plus, they're very minor changes, and 99% of the films are the same way they've always been but look and sound better because they're restored.<br /><br />However, I see no reason why Lucas can't offer both the original version of the trilogy and the newest version on the same DVD set. It's been done before with many other films on DVD, and I know it's something that countless Star Wars fans would appreciate. It just makes sense to me to release the original version on DVD with the new version so that we can observe and appreciate how it used to be and how it is now.<br /><br />So, I give 4 stars for the set because it's gonna be cool overall. But it's not a 5 star set simply because Lucas keeps tinkering with his movies and isn't including the original cuts with it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw, Chariot Stripped was a breath of fresh air to those of us who don't enjoy screaming rock and twangy country which we find on our radios nearly every day. His smooth vocals and piano skills appeal to anyone who listens, and I highly recommend this to anyone, who enjoys any type of music, because Gavin's style can appeal to any mood a person is in, and any type of music they listen to.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Again, people bad mouth groups that do not follow the norm. Even forgetting that the very foundations of Rap and Hip Hop were built on the differences, not the clones.<br /><br /> If we listened to them, Rap and hip hop would have never played, as they try to silence the players. My way or the highway...garbage.<br /><br /> D12 is great. They are not pretentious, do not pretend to be so cool you can't listen to them unless your in your Escalade, and are liked by their own group or peers, like Eve, Snoop, and others. Its the music that drives the soul, the lyrics, and the spirit. If you want to censor the music, fine, but sit back and listen to your gangster rap and pretend the rest of the world don't exist. There is no pretense, I actually laugh, and its obvious what they are trying to do. Wu Tang they are not, but they do not say they are. But its true! Look at the hangers on at the &quot;Mainstream Rap&quot; concerts, one superstar and 25 dingleberries.<br /><br /> I for one will continue to listen to the mix of D12, Dre, Snoop, Usher, LL Cool J, Tupac, 5O cent, Nelly, P Diddy and others. If people want to pigeonhole the music, let them do it on their own time and dime. Its my dime, its my time, your opinion is fine.
B00028HBKM|3.0|As a Messianic Jew, I saw both positive and negative aspects to this film. Jesus' resistance to the temptation to pick up the sword, and His decision to pick up His cross and endure all suffering until He fulfilled His Messianic mission on Golgotha was deeply moving and inspiring. However, this film reinforces the distortion that most Jews hated Jesus and wanted Him crucified. Thus our people were falsely labeled as &quot;Christ-killers.&quot; In reality, Jesus was very popular with most of the Jewish people of His day. It was this popularity that caused the political and religious leaders to fear and envy Him. He was secretly arrested and tried, not to hide it from the Roman authorities -- who also feared Him -- but from His fellow Jews. Likewise today, most Jews regard Jesus highly, as a good and wise man, perhaps even a prophet. And a growing number of us even believe He is the promised Messiah of Israel.
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|While this Marillion outing is not the 5 star effort their last disc Araknaphopia was, it is well above average. <br /> I made the effort to get the 2 CD version from the Marillion web site at the same price that Amazon is selling the 1 disc version, and it includes 4 more songs including the almost epic 18 minute song &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot; plus additional songs &quot;Genie&quot;, &quot;The Only Unforgivable thing&quot; and &quot;The Damage&quot;
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne sold millions of copies of her debut album &quot;let go&quot;. Many people wondered if she could do it again. She definitley did, only this time, she did it better. Avril grew up a lot since &quot;complicated.&quot; on &quot;under my skin&quot; she ditches the depressing and negative lyrics, for positive, upbeat, and serious lyrics. on &quot;nobodys home&quot; she forgets about boy troubles and talks about a girl who wants to return to an easier life, but she cant. &quot;slipped away&quot; is a song to her grandfather who passed away while she was touring. &quot;who knows&quot; and &quot;freak out&quot; are surprisingly upbeat, which is something most people didnt expect. The album is less pop and more rock, but Avril sticks to the catchy songs and choruses. &quot;under my skin&quot; is a million times better than let go, and id advise anyone to check it out, even if they werent a fan of her first album. &quot;under my skin&quot; is an amazing album. its one of the very few that is so good, you could never get tired of it!!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is the most exciting music I've heard in years. Unfortunately I live in an area where you rarely hear music other than hip-hop, country, or Mexican channels. Heaven forbid you hear some new music that has a decent beat and doesn't come from the US in this area. Anyway, I had not been exposed to any of the &quot;hype&quot; of Franz Ferdinand and happened to hear a small clip of &quot;Take Me Out&quot; on KROQ (LA radio channel). I immediately liked the different sound of this band as well as the smooth, sexy voice of the singer, Alex Kapranos. I bought the album and have not been able to take it out of the cd player since (2 weeks now). I love the upbeat nature of the songs as well as the lyrics that are sometimes odd but catchy. I love the somewhat retro sound and look of the band and scream out &quot;it's about time&quot; everytime I listen to the cd. I'm just going on my gut about this band and it says it wants more!
B0001AP12G|5.0|OMG!!! I will just say that this is by far the best cd i own. I never have to press the skip button on my cd player, because every song is great!. My favorite songs are: Jesus Walks, All Falls Down, Workout Plan, Spaceship, Never let me down, Through the Wire, Breathe In Breathe Out, Get em' High, basically all the songs on the cd are aw -awesome. If you dont have it GET YOUR LAZY ASS OFF THE COMPUTER AND BUY IT!!!
B000286S8S|4.0|This is a great cd to for new van halen fans. You hear some of the best songs of sammy and dave and even what they are like live. The new tracks are not great, but by no means bad (exept learning to see). However, you really cannot make a &quot;best of&quot; cd for van halen. The only true essential van halen compilation would be to buy all of there cds.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|i was really expecting more of this album after the hit single &quot;my band&quot;. i thought the songs would be a lot better. some of the songs arent that bad and i can listen to them but a lot of them are just regular songs, nothing special about them. i recomend just downloading some of the good songs.
0452285186|2.0|Quite sick, not that funny. Some drawings are particularly disgusting. I don't know, but I think the majority of it simply doesn't work.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Scary Movie is a parody of several films; I know What You Did Last Summer, Scream, The Exorcist, even Matrix. <br />Though not a masterpiece, it is a funny movie, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.  The casting is very good, and the story very well written. <br />Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!
0064407667|4.0|In &quot;The Bad Beginning,&quot; we are introduced to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, who suddenly become heirs to a very large fortune when their parents die in a fire. The encounter all sorts of misery when their guardian attempts to steal their inheritance. <br /> This book does contain many depressing things, but it documented in a way that lets the reader percieve the humor in each situation. Also, the Baudelaire children have a camaraderie that helps them (and the reader) survive each event more or less intact.  <br /> The Bad Beginning is a quick, lighthearted read that is an excellent introduction to the series.
B000059XVS|5.0|Definitely a great epic and an all time classic, Lawrence of Arabia, brings to the screen the story of Lt Lawrence a British military officer during WWI as he tries to unite the Arab Bedouin tribes against the military occupation of the Ottoman Turks.  There are no words to describe this multiple Oscar winning movie.  Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif (both major Hollywood heavyweights) as well as the rest of the cast truly outdid themselves in this one!  It is simply amazing how a movie made in 1962 surpasses by far most movies that have been made in later years.   <br />One must keep in mind that these classics must never be compared with today's Matrix-era movies/technology for they are from a time long gone. <br />Therefore it might seem slow at times, but keep in mind that this is the 1960's after all, and the effect it had at the time was tremendous! <br />Together with Spartacus, The 300 Spartans, Cleopatra, and the Fall of the Roman Empire, Lawrence of Arabia makes my list of Top 5 classics of all times.   <br />A great marvel indeed!
1400032717|5.0|This novel is, in my opinion, a philosophical gem. Through Christopher's orderly (autistic) view of the world and his surroundings we are introduced to the disorder and emotional instability of those around him -- the &quot;non&quot;autistic ones, -- his parents, the Shears and the characters on his journey through this compelling tale.       I found the subtle storytelling to be remarkable. I am truly grateful to have read this story.       I also recommend Life of Pi.
B00006IU73|5.0|I can hear so many influences right from the first notes of Blackest Eyes with the heavy guitar riff in open D tuning, thru the Japan-esque keyboards of Barbieri and Crimsonesque drums of Harrison. To call these guys a mix of Crimson and Radiohead wouldnt include everything else Wilson brings to the mix - 80's pop and alternative are as much in the mix as the 60's and 70's prog rock everyone touts. This album is really an original mix of everything listed above and more, with gorgeous vocal harmonies covering the conventional and unconventional to add yet more texture to what is already a thickly textural album. Bottom Line : if you are a prog rock fan of any time period you need to buy this album. This is worth the money and wait IMHO.
6305537321|4.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's is the story of how Hannibal Smith from the A-Team won the heart of a crazy woman. But not just any crazy woman--the single most messed-up, finicky, hopelessly unsatisfied ball of estrogen in the world. Take note that most of my points here go to the excellent George Peppard, who's as smooth as ever, even without his cigar, leather gloves, and machine gun full of magic bullets. All the other actors (with the exception of Mickey Rooney, racist jerk) were fine, but I always have a hard time watching older movies 'cause it seems like people talk in code. For example: when Audrey Hepburn says, &quot;Oh, I just saw a yellow-feathered pidgeon eating the berries from a juniper tree, it was delightful,&quot; it ends up meaning, &quot;Make love to me while I drink excessive amounts of scotch,&quot; and I'm none the wiser. <br />  <br /> This movie also features the best party ever thrown, the kind of wacky, kooky, smoke-filled party that makes you a swinging cat just for standing around in the middle of it. We should all aspire to throw such a mah-velous bash at some point in our lives. Really a great movie if you love it when a plan comes together.
B0001AP12G|3.0|i waz very suprised that this album waz actually ......aiight. i wazn't TOO sure about it caz i'm not too keen on the mainstream world of hip-hop (yeah i do consider him mainstream caz....hello he'z alwayz on MTV) but anywayz, just about all the beatz on this album are hot. my ALL time favoritez are \\"All Falls Down\\" (i play that song non stop because Syleena's voice is so SOULFUL!!!!), \\"Spaceship\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"Workout Plan\\" (i love that song LOLZ!!!) and then \\"Two Words\\"(thatz the HOTEST track off the whole cd, in my opinion). i woulda gave this album 5 stars.....but the skits in between the songs were kinda....ummm, bothering me and they were sorta wack.....but thatz jus my 2 centz ;o)
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp is a chameleon. He never seems to play the same character twice in any film. Granted, he brings many of the memorable traits of other films into each of his performances, but he's never boring. Depp is the main reason to see SECRET WINDOW. He plays writer Mort Raney, a somewhat successful author, who is going through the pains of an impending divorce. One day, a stranger knocks at his door and accuses Mort of stealing his short story, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What a strange man...in a Quakerish style hat, with a rich Southern drawl, and cold, clinical eyes. John Turturro is wonderful in this role, bringing an inevitable demonic presence into Depp's tortured life.<br /><br /> Although the outcome may be apparent, it doesn't really hit you until the director David Koepp wants it to. Depp's performance is great, including his habit of cracking his jaws whenever things get a little nervous. Maria Bello and Timoth Hutton as his estranged wife and her lover perform adequately, but they are really more plot tools than characters. Charles Dutton, likewise, isn't given a whole lot to do, but his presence is commanding. Veteran character actor Len Cariou is also good in his role as the local sheriff.<br /><br /> SECRET WINDOW is a quietly suspenseful movie; it's not really a &quot;scary&quot; movie, but more of an intense portrayal of a man's descent into madness. Depp was perfect for the role.
B000002IWQ|3.0|I count myself as a big fan of Rush, but this album seems to be an unfortunate departure for them, a letdown after Roll the Bones, Presto and Hold Your Fire. <br /> <br />It does have some strong entries.  I particularly like Everyday Glory, which seems like something that would have fit nicely on Presto.  Leave That Thing Alone is a very nice instrumental.  Animate is a solid opening that I recently saw them play in concert.  And, though the lyrics are less profound than they'd like to be, Cold Fire has a nice desperation to it. <br /> <br />The problem is that much of the rest of the album drags the other material down.  Nobody's Hero and Alien Shore have a self-satisfied quality to them that grates.  They seem less introspective than preachy.  Double Agent begins well, but loses its momentum amidst a mind-numbing voiceover.  Stick it Out is simply unpleasant to listen to.   <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a very mixed bag.  It simply doesn't compare as well to their earlier fare.  Lyrically, this album seems more of a departure.  I just don't think it worked very well.  The enchanting abstraction that marks other Rush fare is absent, and the void is often filled by lyrics that aspire to profundity but fall a bit short.
B00008EY65|5.0|You have to give Ron Perlman credit.  Who else would spend years on a tv show ensheathed in mounds of makeup and then turn around and do it again in HELLBOY?  Well, Ron, you've finally had a box office hit as the star!  Perlman is a good actor to hide in make-up; his voice is rich and tremolous; his eyes expressive, and his movements secure.  In HELLBOY, he uses these talents to bring us a delightfully flawed hero.  In films like this, I should think one could leave behind the concern over well developed characters and credibility.  It's a filmed comic book, for Pete's sake.  It has a lot of intense action scenes; some pretty cool monsters and a talented cast filling out their roles quite well.<br /><br />The CGI effects fit the movie perfectly; whether they set new trends of compare to others, that's really not the point.  They worked in this movie and that's all that really matters to me.<br /><br />I had a great time watching this movie; that's entertainment!
B000000WCA|5.0|OMG! I remember when they came out. I was a complete fan of them. I like them better than the Hanson which I thought they're music was very annoying. I love 2 become 1 and Mama. God, I really miss those days! It's too bad I never had their cd.
B000001EGE|5.0|One of the best rock albums of its time was Elton John's Honky Chateau album from May 1972. It is a terrific effort and sounds like a real band played on it. Gone is the &quot;wall of violins&quot; effect from earlier Elton records, and in its place we have some rocking and soulful tracks with some lighthearted moments thrown in as well. The Honky Chateau (D'Hierouville) in France was the venue for the recording sessions , and was the first appearance in the Elton John Band of the popular Davey Johnstone on lead guitar and mandolin.  <br />  <br /> Elton became the Rocket Man after his fantastic US #2 hit became one of his most famous songs, and thereafter a concert favourite. This tale of a disillusioned spaceman was timed just right for the tail-end of the space race. The second single was Honky Cat, which was a jaunty, fun-sounding song about the dilemma of whether to stay in the country near your roots or to seek your fortune in the city. Lyricist Bernie Taupin had lived this experience himself in the late 60's before finding fame in tandem with Elton after moving to London. The tune Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters is a splendid song - another of Elton's early classics. It is a sensitive song about people in New York, and has the sweetest melody and delightful piano and mandolin accompaniment. My other favourite song is the stomping Hercules - another rollicking rocker that bears Elton's adopted middle name! Salvation is also a nice one - this has a soulful style to its choruses and great backing vocals (a feature on this album), while Suzie and Amy are rock cuts that benefit from some quality teamwork among the players. Amy has memorable electric violin effects in it. <br /> Slave is a mid-paced track that sounds bluesy , while the whimsical I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself mocks its bleak tile with a lighthearted tap routine instrumental beat. Mellow is another song that runs along mid-tempo and is quite good.  <br />  <br /> Honky Chateau reached #1 on the US chart,and was the album that began his run as a dominant commercial force in 70's music. <br />  <br /> Overall, this is an excellent set, and I rate it 5 stars.
B00009XITP|5.0|Amanda Bynes is my favorite actress so I went to see this movie! I really enjoyed it. And it's funny too! I would get the DVD. When I saw the movie, I though it was great. I don't see why the others did not like the movie or was it simply because the movie attracts more females than the males. Anyway when I saw the movie the day after it was release, it reminds me of The Princess Diaries and Maid in Manhattan. I thought it was really funny when those people were dancing at the ball and then the chandelier had drop. Daphne Reynolds was a really cool character. She was the american teen rebel. I give this movie 5 stars, people!!!!
B00005JNA2|4.0|I have to say that even though I really liked &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, I wasn't exactly begging for a sequel. Though now that I've seen it, I have to say I am really happy that they made one. <br /> The movie picks up nine years later, where Jessie(Etahn Hawke) is doing a book signing for his first novel in Paris, where Celine(Julie Delpy) pops in. From there, the movie follows the same basic guidelines of the origanel with Jesse and Celine discussing their lives and things before Jesse flies back to the states. <br /> The difference this time is taht both charactors are older, less idealistic about love, and maybe even a little bitter at one another. We learn that they never got back togather six months later as they promised at the end of &quot;Sunset&quot;(this is not a spolier. Had they, there wound not be a sequel). But by the two of them being togather, they seem to want to recapture those days and ideals. <br /> And thats why I like &quot;Before Sunset&quot; better than its predesccor. Both charactors this time talk more about experience instead of dreams, and both come across as tragic figures. They had one shot at true love, but never really followed through on it. The dialogue, written by Hawke, Delpy and director Richard Linklater, has a realistic tone, and is full of humor that helps the more sour parts of the movie go down easier. <br /> Seeing these charactors again togather(they were briefly in &quot;Waking Life&quot; togather but...) brought a simile to my face that stayed for eighty minutes. It was like seeing two old friends again, which sounds weird I know, and just happy that their back togather. <br /> The movie offers up another ambigious ending that once again asks us whether we are jaded or a romantic. <br /> I really, really liked &quot;Before Sunset&quot; on every level. Though some people don't want it, here's to hoping we can hear another one of their long conversations again soon.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This documentary is an excellent example of what makes our country great. It is freedom of speech and the liberty to differ and dissent that formed our country in the first place. Agree or disagree, to say that Moore's film should be censored or banned strikes at the very bedrock of our country. <br />This film scares people, it scares the people currently in power and it scares the hell out of their bamboozled lackeys. It does what the corporate media is too spineless to do, expose truth about 9/11, using mainly news footage of the people in question. <br />It's implications are sobering and have potentially far-reaching consequences.  <br />Bravo Michael Moore, thank you for showing us freedom of speech in action and for taking the fire that the majority of us are too scared to take. One day we will hail you as a hero. We are all just too conquered in spirit and mind to do that just yet. We are not quite at the level of maturity that values truth above arrogant bullying or understanding over being reactionary. <br />But I have hope we will one day.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|I saw the movie before I paid any attention to the soundtrack...when I got round to hearing the score...I was blown away...the tension, the emotion...WOW and not other words come to mind...
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Enough crying about the setlist. I am sure that 100 different people would come up with 100 different setlists that they prefer.  Yes the Chili's sound different today than they did 10 or 15 or more years ago but that is precisely why they are still interesting and popular. (Remember, Abbey Road didn't sound like what you first heard on the Ed Sullivan show either). This CD is what live recordings should be.  The songs are obviously different than the studio versions with an explosion of guitar pieces by John. The live versions of these songs are simply much more hard driving than the studio recordings and give the listener insight to the live RHCP experience. While the whole band sounds tight, it is John who really cranks things up a notch and his background vocals are noticeably appealing.  When this band stops performing someday...this CD will be a fine example of live music at its best from a legendary band whose music is constantly changing and growing.  The RHCP are not the same as they were 10 or 15 years ago, but they are still great.
B000000HTO|1.0|Let me be up front. I have loved VdGG for 25 years and Still Life is a LP I will take with me to my grave. But reading all the positive reviews, and the negative one name dropping Davis and Coltrane, I thought an honest reality check is called for. <br />  <br /> Few people like VdGG much. Most people don't get it. I have never met a woman that likes them, except for a couple of the sickly sweet anthems such as Refugees. At their worst they are overdulgent and cringe-making. At their best they are in a parallel universe unmatched by any other band.  <br />  <br /> The band-comparision thing is very dangerous. Personally I love Miles Davis up to about 1972, Coltrane (the Free Jazz excepted), and Hendix, but have never much enjoyed ELP, Yes, Bowie, Genesis or most Prog Rock bands.  <br />  <br /> Certainly if you want your production squeaky clean like Steely Dan, forget it. Most VdGG albums have a wonderful sound, some quite velvety like a Pre Raphaelite painting, but there is also a rough this-was-recorded-in-week feel, and defiant 'our way' attitude.  <br />  <br /> Some of the lyrics are fab, some aren't. Most of the vocals are just something else. Most people say to me &quot;Hammill can't sing&quot;. He sometimes operates near to Tom Waits, but sometimes he has a strange falsetto that Waits-fans will definitely not like. It always sounds like he's never seen a vocal coach in his life, in fact I can imagine him sticking to fingers up at the thought. <br />  <br /> The band / vocal balance works for me like Elvis Costello and the Attractions, or Ian Dury and the Blockheads. A sweet, dense instrumental sound balances the sour vocal sound, but it is not something that appeals to most people.  <br />  <br /> It doesn't rock, and there aren't guitars to speak of, and there isn't a simple melody or chorus structure. In fact, most VdGG intros are longer than most great songs. It's all a bit self-indulgent frankly. <br />  <br /> Maybe you need a little bit of excessive 'adolescent male' attitude to understand albums like Still Life? It seems to appeal to nerdy types who like it laid on a bit thick. <br />  <br /> So be warned - the average person would give Still Life 1 out 5 at most. Us fans would give them 5 stars out of love, and 4 stars if we were honest.
B000002BBY|5.0|I would rather listen to this record more than any record the Beatles or any other artist has ever recorded. I also believe that there are millions of people out there who very quitely still share that opinion years after it's release. <br /> <br />If you liked Kill Bill Volume I you will love this record. If you liked Kill Bill Volume II better then I suggest you check out a band called RadioHead. You know who you are...
B000099T2L|4.0|A lot of people are saying Beyonce didn't deserve her five grammys for this album, but I say that is wrong. If you look at the catagories Beyonce won her grammys, then you will agree with me. Notice she was barely nominated for the three biggest awards of the night: Record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year. She was only nominated record of the year for crazy in love, but she didn't win. She wasn't nominated song of the year or album of the year. She was nominated and won her grammys for the RnB catagories only: Best female rnb vocal performance for &quot;Dangerously in love 2&quot;(she deserved this one because her vocals on that song was powerful), Best rnb song for &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;(She deserved this one because it was a great RnB song), Best rap/song collaboration for &quot;Crazy in love&quot; (She deserved this one because it was the hottest collaboration of 2003), Best rnb performance by a duo or group with vocals for &quot;The closer I get to you&quot; (She and Luther Vandross deserved this one because they did a great job doing this song together, Best contemporary RnB album (She deserved this one because she made all the hits and the songs in this album was the best compared to other nominees on the same catogory, they were all great RnB songs). She deserve to be nominated or win the three biggest catogories, except for crazy in love that was nominated record of the year, and I'm glad she didn't win because she wouldn't have deserved it. She deserved all her RnB wins. <br />  <br /> This album is great! I haven't bought it yet, but I hear the songs on the radio and I can tell it's great. Buy it now!!!
0064407667|3.0|There are plenty of feel-good books out there aimed at children aged 7 and above. This is not one of them. As the author reminds the reader (time and time again), there is no happy ending in this book. It is almost relentlessly depressing with the very rare break when something a little less depressing happens. The Harry Potter books are rather dark in tone also but at least our young hero manages to pull off at least a partial victory at the conclusion of each book. Not so, here. These children are orphaned, sent to live with Count Olaf, a distant relative who has no use for them (except as a means for acquiring their fortune). They are neglected, abused and threatened by Count Olaf. And at the end, just when you expect everthing finally to wrap up happily, the misfortune goes in a new direction. <br />That being said, the story is told in an engaging way, except for the constant asides to define some word or phrase. The children are intelligent and interesting as they try to extricate themselves from the situations they find themselves in. And though some of the events are implausible, to say the least, the book manages to keep your attention. More to the point, it seems to keep the attention of young readers, and if it encourages more kids to put down the video games and pick up a book, it can't be all bad.
B00012FXAE|5.0|The spine tingling film Alien had viewers squirming in their seats and jumping out of them as they watched an alien beast terrorize a spaceship. Aliens brings you back to the planet where it all started, but fifty years in the future. <br /> <br />It opens with Ellen Ripley being rescued out of hibernation onboard a spaceship. A lot has changed in the past fifty years. The hostile planet that's home to the aliens that terrorized her before has now been colonized. And just recently all contact with that colony has been lost. Ellen Ripley follows a team of space marines down to the planet's surface to investigate. And as the title implies, there is more than one alien down there. A lot more. <br /> <br />I love how this movie slowly builds; it gradually raises the tension and drips with suspense. And when the fighting finally breaks out, the action flows nonstop. This time the humans are ready for the aliens, and they have the firepower to prove it. <br /> <br />There is more to this movie than just aliens being blown away in epic battles, the plot has all the required twists and they work oh so well. You really feel for all the characters and sympathize with them, and they act like real humans would. The acting is great; you can really sense the characters' fear and agony. The character of Bishop was acted wonderfully. He's an android who always seems like he has something hiding up his sleeve. <br /> <br />I really must complement this film's special effects also. The aliens look very real and very menacing. I'm sure that quite a few people have had some nightmares involving these creatures. The set design was great, all the way from the spaceship's mess hall to the corridors of the colony. Many people don't regard sets as important as acting or dialogue when in fact they are vital for setting the tone and mood for the movie. The sets used produced Edgar Allen Poe esc feelings of fright, supernatural activity, and allow you to become totally immersed into the film.<br /> <br />The ending to the film is genius, but it leaves you wanting more of a conclusion. It cuts off too abruptly and things never really got a chance to settle down. Perhaps they were thinking about more sequels at the time. Regardless, this is not a fatal flaw, and likewise does not detract from the film too much. James Cameron has combined the elements of suspense and fear with intense action sequences taking the viewers on one hell of a ride.  <br /> <br />-------------------------- <br />[...] - We take reviewing movies seriously, and with an attitude, but not a serious attitude.
0385510438|5.0|Yes - this book does deviate from the standard JG formula. Rather than being told from the viewpoint of yet another lawyer or judge, it is told from someone completely outside of the legal profession. It gave the story a fresh perspective. <br /> <br />More importantly, JG has actually managed to write a character that I did not hate. He has a gift for writing characters that are totally unlikeable, yet tries to put them in the hero role where you are supposed to be rooting for them. See The Partner or The Summons for example. However, The Last Juror brought out a main character who grew and learned as time marched forward. It was nice to see that JG realizes that a main character can develop. I cannot express how important this is to me in a novel - most of his other books I finished and thought \\"Well, that was a waste of time\\". It is so hard to care about a story if you don't care about the people in it. Not the case with The Last Juror. <br /> <br />The ending was a little weak. It was easy to spot coming. It may not have been as thrilling as the typical JG novel, but it was entertaining. All in all, you don't read a Grisham novel to be intellectually stimulated. You read it to be entertained on the beach, an airplane, or on a rainy day. In this context, the book fulfills its purpose better than any previous effort by the author.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Perhaps a takeoff on the &quot;it's a small world&quot; theme? This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. The characters are so well-written and well-acted (and well-cast!) that I could actually imagine being any or all of them. The film also intro'd me to Aimee Mann, and I eventually bought (and I love) the soundtrack as well. Simply: This is a great film even if somewhat of an &quot;epic&quot; (it does run a little long...!). But it's worth it to set aside the time and watch it.
0743454529|2.0|I am probably not the right audience for this--this was totally off Lifetime TV. I didn't think any of the characters had his or her own voice except for the son. Nearly every chapter was depressing, and the ending was completely ridiculous. <br /> <br />Only the medical scenes were believeable in this book, but that's faint praise.
B0000CDL93|3.0|Oliver Stone's JFK is a powerful, well-told story. I saw it twice when it originally hit the theaters and was impressed with the dark picture it painted of renegade government forces conspiring to kill the president. However, any perception I had that it might be true was completely undone when I came home and watched my own copy of a news clip that Stone had used in the movie.      The news clip was from an interview that Walter Cronkite had with President Kennedy in the summer of 1963. Stone's movie used a portion of this clip to support the view that Kennedy was inclined to pull U.S. forces out of Vietnam. The movie portrayed Kennedy's desire for withdrawal as a major reason the \\"military industrial complex\\" wanted to kill him. In the part of the clip shown, the president tells Cronkite, \\"In the final analysis, it's their [i.e. the South Vietnamese people's] war. They're the ones who have to win it or lose it.\\"       The problem is, in the actual interview that I have on tape, Kennedy goes on to say, \\"But I don't agree with those who say we should withdraw. That would be a great mistake -- a great mistake.\\" These two sentences, which were edited out of the movie, completely cut the heart out of the idea that Kennedy was about to withdraw U.S. forces from Vietnam -- thus robbing the \\"military industrial complex\\" of its reason for killing him!      I asked myself, if the one place I could check the movie's claims showed the movie to be twisting the evidence in its own favor, then how should I treat the claims I couldn't check? From that point on I didn't take anything in this movie seriously. It was a good reminder not to get my history from movies. If moviemakers aren't caught tampering with evidence, they'll call their movie \\"true.\\" But if they are caught, they'll say they were engaging in \\"creative license.\\"       JFK is a powerful and gripping tale -- and nothing more.
0790729342|5.0|Before Mel Gibson became such an immense Hollywood icon that he could make a film of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ on his own, he was an Australian movie star who made a number of that fantastic film nation's best movies...and none of them were bigger or better than \\"Mad Max 2\\", released as \\"The Road Warrior\\" in a North American market that (save for a few raving cult film devotees like myself) generally never knew there was a \\"Mad Max 1\\".<br /><br /> George Miller and Byron Kennedy have reinterpreted the American Western in a fashion similar (though hardly as literal) to that of Sergio Leone's own \\"Spaghetti Western\\" visions and Akira Kurosawa's samurai epics...and Mel Gibson (as \\"Max\\", of course) wraps himself in the Clint Eastwood/Toshiro Mifune anti-hero cloak as naturally as any role he has ever undertaken. Max is no longer \\"mad\\" as seen at the end of the first movie (bits of which appear interspersed with newsreel footage to introduce the current world in which the movie takes place in a wonderful narrative piece to update any viewers unfamiliar with \\"Mad Max 1\\"). He is the apocalyptic loner who rides a supercharged black car instead of a pale horse...of course, feeding the car is more of a challenge than feeding a horse, and that is the cycle that Max finds himself trapped within when salvation is offered in the guise of an extremely quirky set of characters ranging from Bruce Spence as a gyrocopter pilot to a besieged town based around an oil refinery who are terrorized by a band of motorcycle brigands with whom Max forges an emnity within the first five whiplash minutes of the movie.<br /><br /> That's the plot, and it works, even in this post Cold War world in which we live now. It works because the action in this movie is absolutely unsurpassed anywhere. It's set at a breakneck pace that only lets up long enough for the viewer to catch his/her breath...and by the time the movie is over, it is impossible to believe that 95 minutes could go by so quickly.<br /><br /> And the action is all that more amazing when considering that all of it was handmade and carried out by real people...real CRAZY people. This was before the age of big budget CGI special effects; there are no blue or green screens here (most of the budget was in the cars)...they lined it up, they shot it, and it is an absolutely amazing string of events around which the film's star has perhaps two dozen lines of dialogue at the most. And it doesn't even matter.<br /><br /> This is the film that helped launch Mel Gibson in the USA. It wasn't the critical success he found with the more mainstream \\"The Year Of Living Dangerously\\", but it put US moviegoers on notice: Watch out for this Gibson dude; he's a major up-and-comer, fair dunkum. Easily one of the most re-watchable movies I own and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who THINKS they know great action movies.And the action is all that more amazing when considering that all of it was handmade and carried out by real people...real CRAZY people.

B0001CNRS4|4.0|Certainly not the most thought provoking movie, but entertaining, fun, and delivers a positive message to us all.  It was refreshing to see young people having fun instead of the ubiquitous gangster stuff.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is a true lyricist and singer..Although I saw her video for &quot;Criminal&quot; and loved the song, it was my mother who introduced me to the album..I seriously have to thank her for that..When I first heard the lyrics, I thought she had to be at least in her early 20's but to now find out that the girl was 18..It just leaves me speechless..For those who say that her lyrics can be a bit schoolgirlish at times, the girl was only 18 when she wrote these songs..Her lyrics are some of the best I have ever read and she writes better than most mainstream artists..You got to give her break!!! But anyway, her music is so beautiful and everything just seems to fit together perfectly..She will always be one of my favorite artists, and this is coming from a girl who loves everything from Teena Marie, to Jay-Z and Christina Aguilera..Fiona Apple f-n rocks!!! Get the CD now!!!!!!
B0001ZXM54|4.0|I am a guitar player and I took a chance on this collection hoping the whole lead on &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; would be there and it was! Later CD reissues chopped it off in the middle. So I was glad they did not edit the old material. The songs in this collection are in chronological order and it was fascinating to see just where the band changed. Once they started using synthesizers and electric drums in the mid-80's, Billy didn't have to fill in as many gaps with his guitar and I think it hurt the band. I still think they were better up to and including Eliminator. I would love to see them do an exclusively traditional blues CD with limited electronic effects.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I loved this album just as much as I love Tidal..They are both exceptional albums..Personally I cant say which is better because I love them both..And I must be crazy because I love the album title..I thought it was cool that she used a poem to &quot;title&quot; her album..As a songwriter myself, I constantly look for people who stretch the boundaries of word usage to create great works of art, no matter what anyone else thinks..She is a great singer but her songwriting is unparelleled...If you like her, pick up both albums, you will get something from each...
B000069CWE|5.0|This is LP's  remix album, a daring stunt as most artists don't put out a remix album until much later into their career. Linkin Park pulled it off though, they brought in other artists to completely re-do the songs. A lot of the songs changed drastically, the metal feel was almost completely erased and replaced with an extreme hip-hop/rap feel. The songs on this album take the songs from Hybrid Theory to another level, from a different point of view. Its an amazing album, the remix version of My December is just as beautiful as the original, which was written for a charity event. 'Reanimation' is an extreme remix and definently something to at least try out. I have a feeling you won't regret purchasing this CD, or any other Linkin Park album.
B0002KVULG|5.0|He's nuts.  I don't agree with any of his criticisms.  The script is streamlined and the dialog and believable.  The special effects only complement the mood and the actors seem at ease. This is one of the better versions of the classic tale.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Star Wars was great. Since Lucas had to edit his movies for no good reason, these movies are no longer the &quot;real&quot; Star Wars. I'm giving these impostor movies 1 star. The originals I would give 4, but not these impostors.
158799190X|3.0|<br /> I expected an &quot;Wow i'm surprised&quot; kind of book, I got an &quot;Ok..got the point..after all that blah blah&quot; .  <br />  <br /> Don't get me wrong, some parts are fun to read but many times beats around the bushes with little hard probabilistic facts.  <br />  <br /> Also seems Mr. Taleb despises speculative actions.. I agree in the trading world that's gambling too much, but in other areas like business (he is not proud of his MBA) you can rely so much on hard data and have to sometimes act on what you think it's best, hunches, trial and error..  <br />  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Ok, most of this film is Michael Moore's opinion. If you have been following Bush since he WAS given the job of President by our wonderful Supreme Court, you understand What Moore is showing to the World. Most the facts have already been addressed in the 15 or more books on Bush. No President has ever had so many negative books written about him,( in 3 1/2 yr and still in the White House) than Bush. I have to admit the film is amazing, shocking and the American people show be ashamed if they Really Elect this unqualified person on Nov 2, 2004. Bush has simply NOT done the job for us as Commander in Chief. Does anyone really believe he has made all the decisions on health care, social security, the WAR, and so on and so on. This simple mined man depends on Wolfie, Rumsie, Cheney, and Rice. Bush has admitted he doesn't read..Wow what does that say about the President. HE is in this Bubble of his World. Protected by his Soldiers and Loyal servants. Every country is against this man, except 48% of GOP. WE can have change on Nov 4th, after all even if he wins, 2008 he will be gone, so lets get it over with, See the Movie.  You don't have to believe everything Moore is saying in the film. Just watch, look at the 9 seconds of Bush just rolling his eyes, after the second plane struck the Twin Towers. Of course the Right will call all this...Bush Bashing. Well, it is Bush Bashing I suppose since most of the facts are correct. YOU have a right to disagree with The White House, they are too secret and are the cause for NOT making the USA safer. SEE it...
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead does a great job with these songs. I created an iTunes list comparing her versions of songs against version of those same songs by other artists. You can here snippets of each version. (...)
B000002UAI|5.0|I're read and agreed with many of the other reviewers here - this album clearly shows the toll that Beatlemania was having on John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br /> In fact, the song &quot;Eight Days A Week&quot; (another Ringo malapropism) specifically refers to the difficult of being a Beatle and the demands / pressures that they were under.<br /><br /> When you look back at the previous two years, you see an incredible schedule / lifestyle which included two albums a year, constant touring, a movie, requests for interviews from all corners of the globe and a thousand other things. It's a minor miracle that these guys even managed to retain some degree of sanity.<br /><br /> Many will look at &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; and see the effects of the above.<br /><br /> For one thing, instead of an album of original Lennon / McCartney tunes, as was the case with A Hard Day's Night, this album contained 6 cover tunes out of a total of 14 songs. It's possible to interpret this a couple of ways. Is this a reflection on their inability, under the constant gun of a deadline to come up with a new lp / single, to rise to the occasion this time? And the cover tunes were simply a convenient way to meet their obligation of a new lp with 14 songs.<br /><br /> Or were the covers simply their way of enjoying some great rock and rock songs that had a huge influence on them during their formative and younger years.`<br /><br /> Notwithstanding some of the criticism, there is some great stuff on this lp.<br /><br /> &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, for example, contains the first recorded feedback of an electric guitar that would later be used by artists like Jimi Hendrix and the Who. This sound apparently came after John accidently leaned his guitar up against an amplfier. It was this type of &quot;accident&quot; and search for new sounds - backward guitars, tape loops, etc - that would become a hallmark of the Beatles in the studio after their touring days were over.<br /><br /> &quot;I'm A Loser&quot;, for example, clearly shows the continuing influence that Dylan was having on John. By his own admission, John had heard &quot;Freewheeling&quot; and had gone &quot;potty on Dylan&quot;. Up to that point, alot of the Beatles songs were about &quot;she loves him&quot; or &quot;he loves her&quot;. Dylan taught the John to think about writing in a more personal style. It's hard to believe that a man who was the leader of the worlds most popular and important band, the idol of millions, a millionaire at a very young age, etc would think of himself as a &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; or (I'm A ) Loser crying out for &quot;Help&quot;.<br /><br /> Such was the appeal of John Lennon. It was comforting to know during the turbulent teens / 60's that even John Lennon was afflicted by feelings of insecruity and self-doubt.<br /><br /> The Beatles began this album about two months after the release of &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. All things considered, I would say that this album is a very good album.<br /><br /> And keep in mind that if this album is considered, by Beatles standards, weak, every other band on the planet would give their left you-know-what to record / release an album as &quot;weak&quot; as this.r. <br />  <br /> &quot;I'm A Loser&quot;, for example, clearly shows the continuing influence that Dylan was having on John.

B00005JMAH|4.0|Overall this was a good movie, if you put aside ALL of the differences it had from the book. I am glad that humor was added back to this movie since it had been missing in the first two films.  If that meant though that key information would be dropped from the film I would have chosen to forgo the humor. What I do not like or understand is the necessity to change characters or the setting.  One that really bothered me was Professor Flitwick he completely changed, he now has slicked back black hair and no beard instead of his grey hair and beard. Tom the bar keeper at the Leaky Cauldron also completely changed into a hunched back with a creepy look and attitude.  Why is a choir song more important to view than to hear how important it is that Harry's patronus is a stag and why Lupid knows how to use the Marauders Map? I also do not understand why it was ok for Harry to use magic at the beginning of the movie under his covers? Harry explains at the end of the first movie that it is not ok to use magic outside of school, he will also have a hearing on using magic outside of school grounds in his fifth year. Yes, it was funny but it wasn't accurate or needed when other important information was lacking. I also did not care for how Harry received the firebolt, It took out key parts of the film including the fact that Gryffindor finally won the Quiditch cup against Slytherin.
B000002UAF|5.0|After their conquest of America and turning on an entire new continent to Beatlemania, the Beatles returned to England with a real challenge in front of them.<br /><br /> In addition to their &quot;twice yearly&quot; requirement to record and release another LP, a film based on &quot;a day in the life&quot; of the Beatles&quot; was also in the works.<br /><br /> Without a doubt, the Beatles once again rose to the occasion - both in terms of the album they released and the film. In fact, some very prominent filmakers i.e Steven Speilberg have stated publicy that A Hard Day's Night had a significant impact on them as future film makers.<br /><br /> A couple of things stand out for me when listening to A Hard Day's Night.<br /><br /> Firstly, this is the FIRST Beatles album which featured Lennon / McCartney tunes exclusively. If you listen to any of their previous albums, you'll see that there were always a couple of cover tunes on them (primarily American R & B songs or Carl Perkins-type tunes).<br /><br /> But more importantly for me, this album primarily showcased John Lennon's songwriting / perfomring talents as the lion's share of the songs on this album, although attributed to Lennon / McCartney, were clearly Lennon-inspired songs.<br /><br /> The title song, for example, was inspired by one of Ringo's malapropisms or, as John referred to them, a Ringoism. Remarkably, this song was written, arranged, rehearsed and recorded in a little over 24 hours. And it may have the most distinctive and instantly recognizable opening chords in the history of music. There is no mistaking what this song is once you've heard that chord..!!<br /><br /> This album also had an significant impact on an important American band (one of my favorites), that was later given credit for the folk-rock sound. Roger McQuinn of the Byrds heard a distinctive &quot;jingle jangle&quot; sound on the album and after seeing the movie realized that George was playing a new 12-string Rickenbacker guitar. Roger loved the sound, eventually got his own 12-string and in the space of a year, we were all treated to the sounds of &quot;Mr. Tambourine man&quot; and &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot;.<br /><br /> In 1964, it was a very special treat to enjoy a new Beatles album coupled with a great film.<br /><br /> Forty years later, both the film and the album still stand up very, very well.ng Rickenbacker guitar.

B0002ON6ZK|5.0|From the director Robert Zemeckis, filmed at Paramount Studio, 1994.  This film has to be one of the finest in decades.  Tom Hanks plays his character Forrest Gump so beautifully you would believe there is no pretense.  Hanks demonstrates his character Gump with such passion that he will bring tears of sadness to your eyes from the magnitude of truthfulness he displays.  At almost the same time, Hanks will bring laughter to your face from the sheer honesty and most sincere expressions as he plays out his character.  All of this comes together for the outstanding performance of Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump when he triumphs, winning your heart over with just the absolute integrity of the character.  Once in awhile a film touches people to the inners of their very soul.  This is no doubt one of those films that will go down in history as the remarkable performance is exhibited by Tom Hanks.  The highest rating is five stars which this film deserves.
B00003CXXM|5.0|This action-packed thrill-a-minute spy story is based on the excellent book by Robert Ludlum (he's still the best).  This adaptation is excellent.  It starts out fast and keeps the pace right up to the end, which is very satisfying. <br /> <br />I can't wait to see the sequel The Bourne Supremacy.  I know Damon is back, I hope the woman is back too.  They had excellent chemistry. <br /> <br />Over-all, one of the best spy-movies I have ever seen.
0671582364|5.0|The audio version of this book is far superior than the print version. The fact is that when Stephen King speaks, it's as though you are in the room with him. When he talks about his life, his hardships, and his successes, it is as though you are a friend. This audio book offers sincere content and outstanding narration.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Yep, it's true. &quot;Beggars banquet&quot; is The Rolling Stones greatest album ever! Every song is a must listen, and a masterpiece, as well. &quot;Sympathy for the devil&quot; is one of their greatest song, that features excellent lyrics and nice guitar work, by Keith. The following song, &quot;No expectations&quot; is a folk song, with nice lyrics. The other highlights, is my opinion, are: &quot;Jigsaw puzzle&quot;, &quot;Street fighting man&quot;, &quot;Stray cat blues&quot; and &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, which is perhaps the masterpiece of the album. &quot;Beggars banquet&quot; are way better than &quot;Let it bleed&quot;, &quot;Sticky fingers&quot; and even &quot;Exile on main st.&quot;. The Stones made their greatest album ever here. Thanks for reading again! I'll be back soon!
B00005AQE8|2.0|Sure this CD has some good tracks, however the second CD is just plain wack, the only good song on the second CD is &quot;all eyes on me&quot; the rest is all filler, Me against the world was pac's only good album, the rest of his albums are wack.
0694003611|5.0|This is the last book I read my daughter every night before she goes to sleep. She's 5 months old but has loved this book (or tolerated it) since she was 3 months old. Now it's part of the routine. It's a great book -- now I know why so many parents have this book!
B000286S8S|2.0|Whay don't they release the best of Era 1 and the best of Era 2 for f**ks sake?  It's obvious that many fans are only buying this to listen to the old Era.  The new tracks suck, they aren't even worth a star.  Your probably better off downloading the best MP3s and then burning them onto CD.
0689835604|2.0|I think the illustrations in this book are a little creepy. My baby is not so nuts about it either.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I think this was a brilliant film in its entirety and for the many reasons others have mentioned, but I loved the subtle things in the film that one could miss if not paying attention or if unfamiliar with Catholic tradition.  It was a great film for all people and all religions to see, but it was interesting to see a major motion picture told from such a very Catholic perspective.  As for the violence, I thought it was accurate to the way things were and I have to say that this is the first time I have ever heard such an outcry from Hollywood or anywhere about violence in film.  I think it is worth seeing by everyone, though I would use discrection when allowing children to see it.  I saw many kids in the theatre, but I don't think I would have allowed my own children to see it until they were older.

B00008EY65|3.0|I recently caught a TV ad for this DVD release and quickly headed to my local video store to rent it.  The concept looked great in a 30-second commercial.  And, in fact, the concept is great.  But the execution of that concept was a letdown.<br /><br />Take a little bit of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (the ending, anyway), a little 'Men in Black,' add some 'Spawn,' and you have 'Hellboy.'  Unfortunately, the whole is less than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />The Hellboy character sounds promising and full of box-office potential.  But this film, like so many (too many) others is plagued by an uninspired and formulaic plot, underdeveloped characters and weak attempts at humor.  The film's only strength (a relative term here) is its special effects, but they're about as uninspired as the rest of the film, and nothing worth laying down the long green to own.<br /><br />This movie was truly a disappointment to me as the TV spot really had my hopes up.  After previous films like 'Blade' (very cool), 'Spiderman' (good) and 'Hulk' (basically well done), I was starting to think Hollywood kinda sorta knew how to bring comic-book characters to the big screen.  Silly me.<br /><br />Ron Perlman is a very capable actor ('The Name of the Rose'), but here he's just a big cigar-chomping red guy with a serious scalp condition.  We hardly learn anything about who or what Hellboy is or what powers he possesses.  Yeah, he looks cool, but beneath that red exterior he's as shallow as a kiddie pool.  There's no angst.  No inner conflict.  And even when catastrophe strikes (practically everyone important in his life buys the farm at some point), he doesn't seem to really care.  The love subplot between the female firestarter character and him is so poorly developed that when he utters the line at the end about how he'd cross over to the other side just to bring her back it rings hollow as...er...a bell.<br /><br />This film sits squarely in the 'rental' corner.  I'm generously giving 'Hellboy' 3 stars for its potential (which was barely scratched).  Reportedly, a sequel is already in the works.  I won't get my hopes up a second time.s barely scratched).  Reportedly, a sequel is already in the works.  I won't get my hopes up a second time.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is to correct all the folks that are being fed false info about Pantera...CFH is a highlight album from a band that discarded a glam image and then pretends it doesn't exist they had 4 albums prior to CFH...Metal Magic, Projects In The Jungle, I Am The Night, and Power Metal. Power Metal was Phil Anselmos first album with the band and it is in all fairness a good album...but CFH is a killer album with no filler on there at all anyone interested in Pantera owes it to themselves to get this album. Diamond Darrel (thats right Diamond Darrel) absolutely shreds his heart out and Vinnie Paul and Rex Rocker supply a rock solid rhythm section that never misses a beat. Dimebag indeed...
B00009V7P8|1.0|I would give this zero stars if possible, it would be tremendously funny since then it would match the album title.  somebody burned me a copy of this.  I am either going to use it for a coffee cup coaster, return it to the person, or give it to someone I only can hope will appreciate this whiny little man.  I think this would be a better instrumental cd.  I am not just bashing the religious nature of the music.  I just think this guy was not meant to sing.  Perhaps he should write and let someone else sing.  Also, the words themselves don't go good with the rhythm of the guitar.  The end.  May I never listen to this dude again.  He stinks.
B0000640VO|5.0|I Must Have Amelie! <br />  <br /> What a delightful, endearing movie this is. I couldn't believe most of the comments I read were so negative. I'm consistently amazed when people dismiss fictional characters as &quot;unbelievable.&quot; Where is it written that everything must be rooted in literalism and stick to the tedious confines of abject humanism? Amelie is a joyous tale where everything is possible if one will only allow oneself to get out of one's own way.  <br />  <br /> Visually it's a treat - it's every Parisian fantasy come to life with a score that fairly screams &quot;Paris!&quot; <br />  <br /> Director Jeunet captures everything with a deft touch and he is aided by a uniformly excellent cast - most notably in Audrey Tautou who is . . . (sigh) just about perfect.  <br />  <br /> I love you, Amelie! <br />
B00023BLXK|3.0|The dancing wasn't impressive and the story wasn't complex or deep. If you can enjoy simple &quot;boy meets girl&quot; stories or enjoy watching people dance then you will probably enjoy seeing this movie once (but I doubt twice). I would recommend renting instead of buying.
B00005A46T|4.0|The debate of the century seems to be whether or not Slipknot is metal. After all, they do have a DJ. Plus their Self-titled album seemed to have more of an emphasis on rap than metal. Well with \\"IOWA\\" Slipknot seemed to have evolved past their rap stage. The songs on this album are perfect to get angry to, especially \\"People=Sh*t\\", \\"My Plague\\", \\"The Heretic Anthem\\", etc. While Slipknot can't match up with heavy metal legends like In Flames, Slayer, Metallica (the good years), and Opeth, and since I'm into that I give this album 4 stars.
0385336810|1.0|As a fan of the Shoppaholic series (particularly the first book) I was VERY disappointed in this one. I am simply amazed by all the rave reviews. <br />  <br /> Where can I begin? I agree with the person who said that &quot;er, um, erm&quot; was a major fixture in this book. Another repetitive theme--Emma standing staring off into space and thinking idiotic thoughts. All of a sudden a voice calls, &quot;Emma.&quot; and she looks up to find [fill in the blank of person she is shocked to see here]watching her. <br />  <br /> I was NOT interested in this character and don't understand why Connor was interested in her either. I also don't see the appeal of Connor either--OK so in the beginning he was a big know-it-all and would tease and mock her in the beginning--fascinating. Further, their relationship was very undeveloped. Two dates and she's in love...riiight. <br />  <br /> Finally, there were many idiotic, silly little plot lines (i.e. Emma thinks her roomie is having sex noisily but it's just her practicing dance routines with a partner for the big dramatic dance finale at the end!). The tension that was attempted was so uninteresting. (Here's a sample of bad dialoge: &quot;'You stupid cow!' Lissy slaps Jemima across the face. 'What were you doing?' 'OW!'&quot;) Worst yet, Connor's big &quot;SECRET&quot; (which I won't reveal here) was a huge disappointment--VERY cheesy.  <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw is so passionate about his work and you can definately hear it in his music. He has raw talent that you definately don't hear very often now days at all. He is a writer who writes with his heart and isn't afraid to speak the truth about love, relationships and self image when most guys now days are. His songs are the best to listen to cheer you up or nake you cry, every song portrays something new and wonderful. This cd contents are full of love, hope, disappointment, self image, joy, and the push that keeps people to be able to wake up every morning and say they love there life and there ready to live it. This cd has changed my life and made me more positive and happy to be living each day! <br />It is a awesome cd and chariot stripped is by far the best live cd i have heard in many years. i hope you will give him and this cd a chance to change your life with his amazing voice and lyrics and fall in love the amazing artist known as gavin Degraw
B000002J0B|4.0|After Zeppelin 4 was released, it reached critical acclaim and sold millions of units sending Zeppelin into the stratosphere and officially making them the best band of all time. Two years later, in 1973, they recorded this excellent follow up. Some may say it's not as good as Zoso but that's prolly because their expectations are set too high. Read on for my review. <br />  <br /> 1.The Song Remains The Same-A nicely played multilayered song with heavy parts followed by extremely soft spots. Overall, an upbeat intro to an upbeat album and is really a catchy as hell song. <br /> 2.The Rain Song-The only problem with the album really. The song stretches for 8 minutes and doesn't really have much dynamically happening which just generally makes the song boring. Cool to have Bonham playing with jazz brushes though. <br /> 3.Over The Hills And Far Away-It's like a five minute version of Stairway To Heaven and has an instantly recognizable acoustic riff to start the song out but the song quickly begins to rock out. Shockingly, John Paul Jones pulls out a cool bass line during the solo which is quite unusualy for Jonesy who's known for being very reserved and not generally showing off. <br /> 4.The Crunge-Let there be funk. This is just a weird but catchy funk song with cool bass work by Jonesy and an excellent backbeat by Bonham. <br /> 5.Dancing Days-Total hippie song. This song is just soo happy that it makes the listener happy. Even though it's not commonly played on the radio, it has a real catchy riff and overall great performances by the band. <br /> 6.D'yer Mak'r-For those who don't know this is a weird way of saying Jamaica. If you disagree then watch the Old Grey Whistle Test interview on the Zeppelin DVD and you'll see that I'm right. Anyway, this is a total departure for Zeppelin and has a cool reggae feel to it. It shocks me how Robert makes such crappy lyrics as what this song has and makes them sound good. <br /> 7.No Quarter-Ladies and gentleman, John PaulJones on keyboards. This is a real dark mystic song and tells a tale of Vikings. Jonesy does a great job on this song as does the great jimmy page. <br /> 8.The Ocean-&quot;We've done four already and now we're steady and then they went 1, 2, 3, 4&quot;-John Bonham's only solo vocal performance (recorded at low volume intro) Old school blues is back. This is just a great song with constant stop start playing much like Black Dog off of Zoso. The bluesy instrumental part during the solo is also really cool. Great ending to a great album. <br />  <br /> Overall, they pulled it off. They did what they shouldn't have been able to do. They didn't do as well as Zoso but still whipped out a great album for the ages that any and all music fan should own. Then again, any music fan should own the entire Zeppelin collection. That's my two cents. Peace. <br />
B00005JLR8|5.0|This film is phenomenal! The story is small and somewhat insignificant in the grand scheme of things but isn't that what life for most immigrant American's really is? <br /> <br />The Sullivan's arrive in America illegally and find themselves living in a junkie infested tenement in New York. With the dreams of immigrants, having arrived from Ireland, they set up a home proudly and without questioning their circumstances. The apartment becomes a bohemian beauty and is filled with love between the Sullivans's despite the dire circumstances they face. The family struggles with finding jobs, maintaining pride and adapting to the openness of life in America. The two young girls who play the Sullivan daughters are absolutely adorable and seem to run through life filled with innocence and hope, something adults sorely lack most of the time. The girls befriend many of the \\"strangers\\" in their neighborhood and seem to adapt to all of the endless oddities that surround them. Their greatest friend comes in the form of an ailing artist, (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou), who looms over them with what soon becomes a lifelong affection. The intricacies of the relationships in this film are what make it extraordinary. All of the actors are perfectly casted and deserve attention for what they have accomplished, no one is over the top yet they have all earned stardom for their down-to-earth simplicity. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a movie that is effortless but well-written with characters of great depth and meaning this film is for you. Many scenes are touching and will make you consider your own existence in America, possibly appreciating it a little more.   <br />

B00005B36H|5.0|I own over 600 rock and roll albums.  This is the best one I have.  No higher praise can be given to an album than calling it the best of all time.  Zeppelin, Sabbath, Rush, Pink Floyd...all the masters' work over the years culminated in Tool's perfect release: Lateralus.  More so than Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or Rush's Hemispheres, I feel that Lateralus is the ultimate, complete musical experience from start to finish.  Each song is perfect, each note, lyric and drum fill has a purpose and meaning.  There is no filler on this album...every moment is important to the experience.  If you are at all musically inclined, this album should inspire you to create your own music.  Tool are the Zeppelin and Sabbath of this generation, the band that has defined and redefined the boundaries of rock in our time.  Progressive, ethereal, driving, soothing, surprising, and 100% brilliant - Tool's Lateralus is the best rock album ever made.
B000062YAZ|5.0|i am a 13 year old, christan who normally listens to christan bands (zao, norma jean, extol etc.)and useally stay away from satanic bands, unless its the black dahlia murder......cause they rock. Anyway, when i herd Angel of death on my sisters copy of the jackass soundtrack i was hooked on slayer. I had herd that this was the best slayer album so i bought. At my local record store the cashier told me &quot;excellent choice&quot; as i paid for it so i expected alot. and slayer most definitely deliverd. If your a christan, dont mind the lyrics. The music makes up for it.This is a great album so go buy it if your a fan of extreme music.
B000002MP2|5.0|This album is incredible from start to finish.  A must buy!  Every song is worth hearing and rocks really hard.  Best Green Day album EVER!!!!  You won't be dissapointed. Great bass lines, incredible guitar solos, and insane drum fills.  The lyrics are so meaningful and are sung great by Billie Joe.  This album has great messages through out and sounds great every time it's heard. YEAH GREEN DAY!!!!
B00005JN2F|3.0|3 stars may be generous, but I thought this movie told a good story. I think Jason Bourne is a great badass, played as close to ordinary as Matt Damon could bring a amnesiac assassin.  <br />  <br /> When someone says &quot;This guy doesn't make mistakes&quot; about a character played by Steven Segal you wouldn't be able to hear the rest over the audience's laughter, but Matt Damon has a way of making me believe it. Maybe it is Bourne's plainness or reluctance to take up his former identity's life that makes him so cool to watch in predator mode. I love how he tracked down his enemies and kept them guessing through the whole thing.  <br />  <br /> Sometimes all you need is a good story, but in this case even the tense script, great performances is brought down by the epileptic cameraman who could not hold still.  <br />  <br /> With movies in Southern California costing upwards of 10 bucks I often find myself weighing the plusses and minuses of going to the theater against waiting for the dvd to rent. I have to be seriously interested in a movie to be bothered with the theater these days, and Bourne Supremacy, I thought, would be worth it. The actors are worthy, and so is the story. Now I have to warn people that while it is a tense film and a well told story, it is a horribly filmed movie. <br />  <br /> People use the term \\"shaky cam\\" to describe the constant shaking of the film, particularly during action scenes. Listen to them. They aren't exaggerating. Certain movies are hard to sit through, but not physically. This movie hurt my eyes, plain and simple. I could not follow the action at all. Why have lengthy car chases no one can understand? The cameraman should have checked himself, or the director should have checked him, or the producer should have checked the director. How could they not know that a style like that on a gigantic screen in a dark room would wear on people's eyes? NYPD Blue is a TV show! Shake the camera all day on a small screen, but what iswrong with the director of this movie? How could he think this would've worked?? I'll tell ya, somebody's to blame for wasting such a good story with such good characters by making the film physically difficult to watch. <br />  <br /> However I will say that this movie might be a better experience on a smaller screen, but don't bank on it. If you're going to spend $10 see something else. I hear the Manchurian Candidate actually manages to hold the camera still AND tell a good story. Wait for dvd, then rent this. Don't buy cause you may find yourself closing your aching eyes and listening to it instead. <br />  <br /> The Bourne Supremacy is a movie with a good story and a good cast shaken into a nauseating mess by poor directing, and there is no blame on Matt Damon or any of his supporting cast. They didn't shake the script around as they read it! Who knows, maybe we can get a \\"special edition\\" DVD where they hold the picture still... wouldn't that be a laugh? <br />
B00006LLLN|5.0|Even if you don't like Bluegrass, this two CD set rocks. Alison's voice is so crisp and pure. Couple that with her ability to inject the subtle emotion that makes up bluegrass music and she just rocks!! Finally, Alison allows the musical talent and vocal talent of Union Station to shine!!      This CD set is a must!
B00005JNEI|1.0|An Australian newspaper review stated in it's first paragraph-\\"9/11 takes information out of context,is full of distortions and half-truths\\". The reviewer then proceeded to give the film  a good review.  Excuse me,but what ever happened to truth in journalism?  I find it interesting that the same people that slammed tabloid journalsim taking things out of context and distorting the truth turn around and embrace it when it suits their politics. What hypocrites they are.  What we have here is left wing version of McCarthyism,this time seeing right wingers under the bed and showing a paranoid attitude to the US Government.  This film just gives ammunition to terrorists and,let us not forget,was made by the same man that in the last election told people not to vote for Al Gore.

0316666343|5.0|Amazing!!! <br /> <br />The story is about Susie Salmon, a 14 year old, who is raped and murdered by a neighbor. The thing is, the story is told from Susie's point of view *after* her death.  <br /> <br />It's a bit disturbing at times, but wonderful the rest of the time. I had a huge emotional reaction to this book, and often cried while reading about heaven and Susie watching her family.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book!!! <br />
B000000WF0|5.0|I recently added Urban Hymns to my CD collection. When I popped it in, I was transported back to 1997, one of the best periods(1994-1997) for music in a long time. Before all the mickey mouse bubblegum crud hit the airwaves and you could still some great alternative tunes on the radio or on MTV2. I personally think this CD stands the test of time when it comes to that period of music and will still show its freshness now or 25 years down the line. Each track was more enticing than the next and it kind of stinks that the band went their separate ways,though richard ashcroft has had a pretty decent solo career.  A must buy for any fan of mid-late 90's alternative
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand's best book. In fact this book is my most favorite book till date. It instills in me, the courage to face the big bad world filled with people who try to rule our lives. It help me to realize that our lives become second handed once we allow people to affect it. Everytime I read this book, I become more assertive, confident and I know when to stop people from walking all over me. This book makes you feel that you are the absolute, everything else comes next!!!!
B00001MXXH|4.0|When I was growing up, Ferris Bueller was a cultural icon. He was the hero of my generation. So imagine my surprise when as a twenty-something high-school teacher I decided to show my students Ferris Bueller's Day Off only to discover that not one in a class of thirty fourteen-year-olds had so much as heard of the film. This is tragic. <br /> <br />Ferris Bueller is a laugh-out-loud comedy that epitomizes the eighties teen-movie genre: All the usual John Hughes ingredients are here, including the adolescent angst, the deservedly humiliated high-school principal and the teen romance. There are even some truly poignant moments in there amid the hilarity. And the director lenses his native Chicago with great affection. <br /> <br />It took me quite a few minutes to settle into the commentary, until I realized director John Hughes's style was deliberately ironic, and from thereon in I enjoyed it immensely. He offers a dry, witty commentary that really helped me understand more where he was coming from as a filmmaker.
B00000I9MK|5.0|Belle & Sebastian's first album, which was the result of guitarist/ Vocalist \\"Stuart Murdoch's finishing his 'Music Business Course'.  And this proves to be a perfect introduction to those new to Belle & Sebastian,  as it's here that you'll find the artistic and musical templates that the band, would work up and constantly refine over the course of the successive albums, resulting in 2003's superb \\"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\\".  Songs that on first inspection had a intensely optimistic twee sound, hopelessly saccharine, on the first couple of listens deceivingly disposable.  But throughout the album, the instrumentation is first class with all band members giving incredibly robust performances in their playing.  And on closer inspection the lyrics proved themselves to be intensely sarcastic and witty and brimming with a subtle intelligence.  The seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and '60s pop, but Murdoch's gift for not only whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. Unquestionably one of those bands that on first listen will leave most listeners scratching their heads, as to what all the fuss is about. But once that initial reservation has been overcome, and the music has had a chance to suck you in, you'll most likely see, why they've managed to build up such a devoted following.  It should be mentioned again that those entering into the world of Belle and Sebastian, would be very well served making this their first album to purchase, as it beautifully illustrates their humble musical beginnings and how they developed and refined their sound and songwriting as a group, which is not to take away anything from this truly superb effort.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I remember 3 years ago when I watched on MTV the anime video of the first single by Daft Punk's album &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;One More Time&quot;. I really thought it was something quite original. The music was also fantastic. Then I found out that there were more videos from the same album following the sequence of events. The story seemed totally awesome. I could only watch 4 episodes and the curiosity covered me. Finally, I decided to own it. The first time I saw it, I watched on a huge 32&quot; TV plasma screen, home theater, and surround sound system. It has been one of the ultimate experiences of my life. I'm 200% satisfied with my purchase. Maybe you should try it too. And I also hope to hear of more joint projects from Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto.
B000002H2H|5.0|Most metal bands I do not enjoy, they're either incredibly sloppy and stupid like Slayer or just plain dumb like Anthrax. Metallica though I have loved; give me the crisp and clean stuff like &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;. Excellent, excellent album, RTL is just a pure adreneline song. And ending with something special like Call of Ktulu? Simpley awesome, this IMO was the best Metallica album ever put out
B00002MZ12|5.0|This is one beautiful Unplugged. Alanis. Holy [bleep], you rock!    You Learn, Joining You, That I Would Be Good, Head Over Feet, I Was Hoping, Ironic, You Oughta Know and Uninvited are favorites of mine. So when I saw that these songs were on this CD, I was greatly happy. I could not wait to hear them, unplugged, live. And oh, my god. Her voice is so beautiful. It made me smile and of course, cry. Not that the songs are sad, it's her voice. Wow.    I wish that this Unplugged had Thank U though. That's all.    But what makes this Unplugged honestly beautiful and precious are No Pressure Over Cappuccino, Princes Familiar, These R The Thoughts and the cover of Sting's King of Pain. I had never heard of these songs before but I was glad to be offered something new. I cannot express in words how much these songs are worth listening to. Oh, my god!    Seriously, this is something to own. It's so beautiful. I wonder how many times I have said that word. BEAUTIFUL!!!

B00005JNEI|5.0|Does Mr. Moore grandstand?  Absolutely; it is the only way to get sound-bite America's attention these days.  Yes, his timelines tend to portray things the way he wants us to see them, but do the research, all the facts he shows are absolutely true.  All he is saying is that we as Americans have a right, a duty really, to question and challenge our leadership, and that the current administration is Hell-bent on taking that right away, and making our government corporate and imperialized, using fear of terrorism as its blanket reasoning.  The scariest thing is that the majority of people either don't know it, or don't care.  Read, watch, think, form your own opinions, people!  It's your country too!!! <br /> <br />And don't criticize a film that you haven't seen!!!!!!
1400049628|5.0|If you enjoy pontificating on the details of horror movies as much as I do and are usually dissapointed by the flawed logic and flimsy theories on topics such as the undead, this book is for you. A non-fiction slightly comedic approach to the horror genre is thoroughly engrossing. I couldn't put it down because it made so much sense. I didn't really laugh nor did it inspire terror in the traditional sense that Zobie stories aim. Instead the book instils a temporary and almost justified paranoia and total fascination with the topic at hand. He has you convinced that the Zombie problem is serious and planning your own plan of action(I know I was going over the logistics of how to demolish my staircase). In that case the book is an interesting study in how survival guides and information such as that distrubuted post 9/11 is an easy propaganda tool because instinctually most of us take guides and manuals of this sort as an indication of a black and white topic that is not to be triffled with. Overall this book is bloddy brilliant and there's so many other ways to analyze it. I constantly lend it out to friends and every one wants to have a chat about where my far away spot would be and their secret desire for a Shaolin spade.
B000002MY3|5.0|Let me just say this: I love this album. Oh, my god. I love this album. Some of the songs that Alanis wrote shocked me. It made me smile. It made me sing and scream along with her while nodding my head to the AWESOME music or dancing and jumping on my bed. It made me feel her anger and pain. Seriously, when I think about what she writes, I feel bad for her. But I also feel happy that she's offered us such an amazing and speechless talent. That she's sharing with us some or all of her deep personal experiences or feelings that she has had. I respect her a great deal. <br /> <br />Out of the fourteen songs on this album (including the alternate take of You Oughta Know and the hidden song that makes me cry every time I listen to it, Your House) the only one that I did not like was Mary Jane. The rest are ... just simply amazing. I can't describe in words perfectly how much I love this album. It IS one of the best and it won I-don't-know-how-many awards. Seriously, this is an album to own. I find that many people, including me, can really relate to it, to her.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|As founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com), I know something about feature movies and this one is a BIG disappointment. For one it is in fact long and seems even longer, moving at a glacial pace. This would be fine, if for our time and money, something of real character develops, but folks, I could not (try as I might) get involved with this story.<br /><br />Jude Law (who starred in such classic films as “Enemy at the Gates,” and who is a personal favorite of mine), here plays a “man of few words,” who ends up looking awkward and out of place in the film.<br /><br />Another personal favorite, Rene Zellweger, plays a character so over-the-top, that it is almost cartoonish, and embarrassing to watch, not something that adds anything at all to her film legacy. As for Nicole Kidman (who I can take or leave), she looks good (as usual), but her character is just too unreal for a woman trying to survive in a developing country. As for her much trumped up brief nudity: give me a break! it does not carry the movie. Aside from these stars, I can’t find another actor in this film that distinguishes themselves so that I would EVER want to see this film again.<br /><br />Beyond that, the film is poorly put together, with crude segues, and a plot that does not even amount to what we could expect from a good session of the Walton’s. The meaningless ending appears abruptly, makes little story sense, and is a poor reward for staying to the end of this seeming endless movie. What was all the hype about? This movie is forgettable and I am doing just that, ASAP.<br /><br />Michael Erlewine -- Founder the All-Movie Guide
6302779278|3.0|This is a decent enough film, particularly considering its genre (romantic thriller as superstar vehicle). Literate writing, some nifty and very effective plot twists, good portrayals all around. But... <br />  <br /> Did anybody notice they used *both* possible endings? There's &quot;the bodyguard turns his back on happiness and goes on to do his duty with a stiff upper lip&quot; and there's &quot;the singer turns back at the last minute and flings herself into his arms&quot; ending, and I'll be damned if they're not both used, one after the other. The technical term for this is a &quot;contradiction&quot;, something you want to avoid in a narrative, particularly at the climax. I've never seen this particular trick used before. I'm sure I never want to see it again. Call it a three-and-a-half.
B000002KB8|5.0|Ozzy Osbourn is one of the best vocalist ever. Tony Iommi is one of the best guitarist of 70's like I said about Jimmy Page. Theres no ryhthm guitarist no lead guitarist Just Tony Iommi. Ozzy isnt quite at his best but he is still good. Bill Ward drums a kick ass beat. Terence Butler dose some killer bass work. This band often gets compared with Zeppelin. Zeppelin's is good but not as good as BLACK SABBATH. Zeppelin's first or second album is there best. Sabbath get better as you follow them through their career Zepplin gets lighter and Sabbath gets heavier. Sabbath have dark sound that I like better then Zepplin. Sabbath is the reason for metal today. But you can call them both the first metal bands. I like to follow both bands through their career. Ozzy is the only singer for Sabbath Dont buy any of there albums with Dio. The Best Sabbath albums are Master of Reality, Paranoid and Sabotage
B00005JNEI|1.0|This film is entirely biased. He act as if its the truth but if you take the time to research it yourself its just propaganda for his point of view. Watch it for the sake of entertainment, but don't think its 100% fact. Most people will see this film and see it as a documentary and thats what he's going for. I'm just saying don't jump on the \\"anti-Bush bandwagon\\" because its cool, do your own research and you will realize this is just a movie. For entertainment purposes it holds its own, its funny, but its not the truth.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I recently heard these folks live at the local Curiosa Festival not too long ago. Their sound is firmly grounded on the group's guitar riffs and accentuated by the singer's distinct voice. Their resemblance to The Smiths, The Clash, The Cure and Coldplay mixed together, makes you feel that rock (or punk rock, should I say?) is alive and well and the eighties are back in a new fashion.<br /><br /> It is hard to pick a best song from the album, since it is all very solid, but &quot;NYC&quot;, &quot;PDA&quot; and &quot;Say Hello To Angels&quot; scream volumes about what they're capable of. I am hopeful that they can maintain this same level of quality in future productions.

B000002OX7|5.0|Bill Gates and Mick Jagger separately have created enough trends to fill about a dozen careers, with some left over. So, it's a little surprising to see them responsible for a trend created in cooperation with one another, and to see that The Who have been by far the greatest beneficiaries of this trend, especially from works on this album, `Who's Next'. The trend is the use of songs written and recorded by major 1960's rock groups in advertising campaigns. The story I heard was that Bill Gates personally approached Mick with the proposal to use the song `Start it Up' as part of the campaign to release Windows '95. Jagger was not especially keen to do it, but didn't want to turn down flat, so he set a figure so high that he thought even Gates and Microsoft's deep pockets would balk, but Bill called Jagger's bluff, and we get the Rolling Stones endorsing Microsoft through the use of one of their lesser songs.<br /><br />Several other classic rock songs have appeared in commercials since then. We are now even treated to the sight of Alice Cooper doing Staples `Back to School' commercials. But, `The Who' have won the commercial exposure sweepstakes. I have heard their songs used as soundtracks for everything from HP computer ads to prescription decongestants. At least they are being used for classy products. The real bonanza has been in the use of Who material as opening theme songs to all three CSI (Criminal Scene Investigation) series. And, in almost every case, the material comes from the `Who's Next' album.<br /><br />This album marks their emergence from their great initial success beginning with `My Generation' and ending with `Tommy' and `Live at Leeds' which is a brilliant recap of material from this phase of their career. There are a few echoes of classic Townsend phrases in these songs, but not many. It is also, I believe, the last album of new material which was done by the original band, before the death of drummer Keith Moon. This makes the album especially poignant, as the band's work was always collaboration of four talents rather than as an instrument to play Pete Townsend's material. And, this collaboration is never more evident than in this album. I am especially impressed by Daltry's vocals. I have seen The Who perform live twice, 30 years apart, and Daltry always seemed on stage to be a conscious parody of a rock star, yet his vocals on this album put Mick and Cocker and Rod and Steve Winwood and any number of other rock vocalists in the shade. Keith Moon's drums are as powerful as ever, maybe even a little more under control than on `Live at Leeds' and Entwistle and Townsend are as good as ever, with Pete contributing excellent backing vocals for Daltry.<br /><br />For as long as I have known and enjoyed The Who, I was not aware until I read the liner notes to this CD that much of the music on this album was prepared for another major Townsend work, a stage play / concert performance entitled `Lifehouse'. These plans fill Townsend's career, beginning with the very early concept album `The Who Sell Out' and ending with `Quadrophenia', peaking with `Tommy'. On sheer creative vision, Townsend always seems for me to outshine even the greatest of rock figures, including John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, and Paul McCartney. The only artist whose ambitions may have been comparable is Frank Zappa. And, Townsend's vision is not limited to doing great music, an area where I believe he outstrips even the very talented Zappa. Townsend's subject matter beginning even with his earliest success, `My Generation' is class and generation conflict, mysticism, and personal freedom. Townsend looks so far beyond the issues of the moment that fueled so much other music of the moment.<br /><br />After all this, Townsend's career reminds me of the career of David O. Selznick, the uberproducer of the movie `Gone With The Wind' who was so afraid of having an obituary headlining him as just the creator of `Gone With The Wind'. Townsend seems to have been committed to creating something better than `Tommy'. While this album is just a collection of unconnected songs, in many ways, it succeeds in surpassing `Tommy' in musical creativity, if not in scope of vision or power of concept. `Tommy' the album had just a little more than its share of filler tracks. There are no filler tracks on this album! If you happen to own the old vinyl version of the album and are still in a position to play it, please know that this CD contains seven (7) tracks which are not in the original nine (9) tracks, although all sixteen (16) come from the same period and group of sessions and are almost all connected with the `Lifehouse' project.<br /><br />After all this, I am just waiting for T.Mobile or AT&T or Verizon or Sprint to start using the song `Going Mobile' in one of their ad campaigns for cell phone services. And, I hope Pete and Roger take good care of themselves. I don't want to loose another `Who' for a very long time.<br /><br />This is possibly their very best single album for music and for powerful, memorable songs..

0375432302|2.0|The second of Dan Brown's books to feature Robert Langdon, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; opens in Paris with the death of Jacques Sauniere. Murdered by a mysterious albino, Sauniere - the curator of the Louvre - realises that a highly important secret will die with him if he doesn't find some way of passing it on.<br /><br /> A short time later, Langdon is woken by a phone call. A professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University and the author of several books, his first adventure was outlinedin &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; - the events of which have turned him into something of a celebrity. In Paris on business, the phone call leads him to the Louvre at the request of the DCPF - officially to lend his experience and knowledge at the crime scene. Sauniere's body had been found in a very strange position, with a number of codes, symbols and phrases written on and around the corpse. Furthermore, it's clear that Sauniere himself was responsible for writing the codes. As Langdon puzzles over the meaning of what he sees, Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist, arrives at the scene. She provided interesting information on the meaning of the codes, and some disturbing information for Langdon himself. It seems that, rather than being asked along for his expertise, he is instead the prime suspect. Langdon and Neveu go on the run - trying to avoid arrest and the albino, while also trying to solve the mysterious sequence left by Sauniere.<br /><br /> After I'd heard so many positive reports about this book, I found it something of a disappointment. Langdon wasn't an entirely likeable character - there were times he was a little smug or dismissive - while Neveu, his sidekick, sometimes appeared almost gullible. Bearing in mind both Langdon's and Neveu's professions it was almost shocking watching them struggle with some of the most obvious clues. While Dan Brown may have been an English teacher, this book does little to support the suggestion that he is a &quot;master craftsman&quot;. The twists and turns I'd heard so much about were pretty obvious, while certain words and phrases were used to the point of distraction. On the other hand, the story is easily enough followed - you won't have to concentrate to figure out what's going on. It'll be a useful way to pass a few hours on a long flight or on the beach. On the whole, though, I think I'd recommend &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;, by Umberto Eco instead. It has a similar 'theme' to &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, but is a much more absorbing book.r craftsman&quot;.

B00005JKGK|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best films I have ever seen.  There are too few feature films that present Chinese American life as something multi-dimensional, but the Joy Luck Club manages to do just that.  It does away with stereotypes and shallow perceptions of Asian culture.  The female leads--both the mothers and the daughters--are strong, beautiful women who are a delight to watch.  As Wang takes us from one story to the next, we never tire because each frame is so meticulously crafted, so well done.  Ming-Na's monologue about the single swan feather at the opening of the film is lovely.  If you love sagas and intergenerational works of perfection, The Joy Luck Club is definitely for you.

B000059TFO|3.0|A racist America!, August 6, 2004 <br /> A Kid's Review <br /> One can see the supression of the black people from the first scene. The Documentar reports shot the racist scene of the 60's. <br /> 1. The two FBI men like Dafoe and Hackman tried to disolve the problem in the deep south by hunting the KKK members. Though they failed to disolve the problems...The black men are in misery again <br /> 2. The two protagonists are white guys and the white guys dominated the roles again,...where are the black heroes in this film? <br /> The white guys on again -&gt; the black men are still in misery! <br /> 3. The complicated problems which happened in the racist deep south, did not sorry anyone in the States, many citizens have just seen the tragedy but did not help them. Black men are in misery again. <br />  <br /> Could USA be a tolerant State in the future? the answer blows everyone of us.  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
0345409671|1.0|Rice gets more and more lurid with the Vampire Chronicles, to the point where this hardcore Rice fan is getting turned off to the series. Lestat's stylish self is missing in this novel and it's hard to have sympathy for him. Religious overtones were a definite turnoff. Rice seems to take a love-hate relationship with the Catholic Church to extremes in her writing and it definitely detracts from this one.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|If you purchase this DVD, don't give in to temptation and watch the \\"Director's Cut\\".  There are a lot of movies where the \\"Director's Cut\\" is equal to if not better than the Theatrical Cut... but this is not one of those instances.  There are a couple of additional scenes spread out sporadically over the course of the Director's Cut, but nothing that radically changes the film... save the ending.  The ending in the two cuts are completely different and after seeing both cuts... I must say the Theatrical Cut has a better ending.  I would even go as far as to understand the reason why the \\"original\\" ending was left on the cutting room floor.  A lot of people have said this movie is a somewhat depressing film in that it shows the consequences of our actions and what would happen if we try to change the past.  In the Director's Cut, the depression factor is overwhelming.  I can honestly say that if I could change one thing in my life... I would not have opted to watch the Director's Cut...
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|It is said the further the Irish get from the holy soil of Erin the crazier they get.  Since the immigrations from Ireland following the Great Hunger, there are more \\"Irish\\" in America than there are in the Emerald Isle.  Given that most \\"Irish\\" families have been American families for several generations now and the high rate of marriage with members of other ethnic groups, it is of some note that customs and attitudes from the old country persist.  All three main characters are sons of Ireland living in the New World.  .  But their \\"Irishness\\" is also not an accident.  Others liken MYSTIC RIVER to a cinematic dissection of middle class life.  But this misses the point.  Instead of keeping the people in this film at a distance and offering contempt for modern American life, MYSTIC RIVER holds these men in sympathy and respect while mediating on the theme of justice.<br /><br />There are three notions of justice working themselves out in the imponderables of the murder of a teenage girl.  Sean is a policeman who works in a world of correct processes, written and codified rules, and a system of rights created to replace the justice of revenge and \\"eye for an eye\\".  Crimes are no longer committed against an individual but are transgressions against the modern civil society itself.  Civil justice replaces the hot-blooded execution of revenge with the detached, cool tempered administration of law.  Civil law is seen as more rational and humane-replacing the perpetual war between clans.  Families and individuals cannot be trusted to carry out \\"justice\\" because their real interest lies in personal vindication and protection for which there are no clear limits in pursuing those ends.  Civil justice labors to protect the accused from miscarriages of justice-swearing it is better 10 guilty go free than to wrongly punish one innocent.  The dark side of civil justice is that the guilty frequently escape punishment.<br /><br />Much older is the unwritten code of tribal justice.  This justice is so old that it seems bred into the bone--appearing almost phantomlike from the deep forests of primordial memory.  It is blood for blood.  Wound for wound.  Tribal justice sees revenge not as an evil but a duty full-blooded men and women must fulfill.  Taking revenge is a sacred duty that sates personal rage and is an obligation.  Honor must be defended.  The blood of a loved one must not be spilt without vindicating his memory.  But wrong blood may be spilt.  The innocent may be punished.  The guilty may be punished beyond measure.  Vindication and revenge often stop at nothing.  Yet in spite of all the advances in the administration of civil justice, it is the rare human being who does not hear the call of tribal justice.<br /><br />But there is another justice that is unnamable and more savage at work in spite of the efforts and safeguards of human justice.  Call it karma or fate, there is a far older, ancient justice ineffable to human understanding.  It is a power that flows into the lives of men and women from some unknown place whose purposes are never understood but rules far more ruthlessly and pitilessly than we can withstand.  Like a mighty river, it cannot be stopped; yet the smallest gestures can change its course.<br /><br />MYSTIC RIVER is a tale of these three modes of justice weaving in and out.  Sean the policeman knows of the revenge murders Jimmy has committed yet keeps these secrets to himself.  Jimmy experiences crippling guilt after carrying out revenge only to find out it was the wrong man.  A horrendous crime has ruined Dave's life-but neither civil nor tribal justice provided vindication-so his past drives him insane.  Several times during the story, characters ask themselves \\"what if I had done something different long ago\\" questions.  But these questions are unanswerable and cannot change the past.  At end of the movie, primordial righteousness has wrecked its justice in the lives of Sean, Dave and Jimmy.  In an odd way,everything has been put aright.  The price of justice is far too high; but it will be paid and not always to our betterment.  Against heartless fate, we can only tender apologies, ask for forgiveness, and offer absolution.  More surely than justice, these change hearts and afford mercy.<br /><br />Sean does not act against Jimmy's crimes because they were not done with \\"criminal\\" intent.  Jimmy was carrying out the demands of tribal justice and not merely to advance his own self-interest.  Sean is all too aware of the imperfections of civil justice.  The biggest thieves are honored while the little thieves are left to rot in prison all their days.  Sean does not justify what Jimmy did; but he will not destroy and further damage the effected families and community just to satisfy the demands of civil justice.<br /><br />Likewise, Jimmy's wife responds to his crimes with love and forgiveness because she sees Jimmy's great heart and love for his family.  As she says, Jimmy is a king and a king must do what he must.  If he made a mistake it was out of love and not malice.  She clings to Jimmy because she trusts his heart.<br /><br />Dave's wife has no such fortune.  She has no such ground to cling to Dave.  She cannot trust either his motives or his word.  His crime redeemes no one and does not vindicate anything more than his own personal demons.  While we have sympathy for him, Dave's own madness destroys him and threatens to take down all whom he loves.<br /><br />The mysterious justice symbolized by the Mystic River rolled on and has done its work.  Its justice is inexplicable and unsettling.  Its judgments are final and undisclosed to us.

0792165020|1.0|The film begins with a piano recital at an upper-class reception. The piano player wears a Princeton blazer. This impresses the host to hire the piano player to go to Europe and return his wastrel son. [Would some top businessman hire an uncredentialed stranger for this job?] Tom Ripley shows himself to be a &quot;charming mimic&quot;, and this is a symbol of a defective personality. Tom continues to study the personal habits of Dickie, like an understudy for a double. This copying again suggests a faulty personality. Tom insinuates himself into Dickie's life, like some parasite. Dickie lives it up in idle self-indulgence like there's no tomorrow for him. [This story just drags on, was it meant to be boring?] <br />  <br /> During a festival the dead body of a woman pops up (she had been friendly with Dickie); the same old story? But Tom's failure in his mission means he's off the job. Dickie also wants to drop him. Will this trigger his psychopathic personality? Dickie's emotional rejection triggers the murder! Now Tom takes over Dickie's life for real. As well as his own! But complications pop up at the opera, and then the cafe. Having committed one murder, another becomes necessary. But now the police are involved, and investigate &quot;Dickie&quot;. Reporters try to take his picture. Juggling two identities becomes more difficult. Can you believe that both the police and the American private detective couldn't expose Tom's charade? This reminds me of Raymond Chandler's essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot; about &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot;. <br />
B0000AM6LY|2.0|While this CD was okay, it was more restrained than earlier Simply Red releases and I was disappointed with the content.  Maybe it's because they're aging.  Many other musicians have fallen short of their earlier works with recent releases, as their CDs yielded only 1 or 2 bankable songs from the likes of Michael Jackson, George Michael, Lionel Ritchie, etc.  Simply Red's remake of Dylan's Positively 4th Street was sad to say the least; it's like doing a Stones' or Beatles' song ... don't go there.   <br /> <br />Simply Red's first US release surpasses this.  Picture Book gave us tunes that are unmistakingly Simply Red, songs like Money$ Too Tight to Mention, Holding Back the Years, Sad Old Red (great jazz), Jericho, etc.  Their second release, Men and Women, wasn't bad either.  But I never liked any of their other works as much as Picture Book because I saw them do it live in Chicago and the show was awesome.  Keep looking ... you can surely find a better Simply Red release than this.  <br />
B0001HAHXW|4.0|All this negativity about the justification of RJ. Sure the dichotomy will remain, but I for one can't stop smiling when listening to the hilarious lyrics and attempts to express his true feelings about the blues (whOOhOOO!!). To think the latter is not authentic, well the only way to judge is to try it yourself. Now back to my organ to imitate that milk cow.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album offers more than just energy and catchy tunes. This album offers deep thought and percision of emmotion from start to finish. Anyone who passes this album off as &quot;played out&quot; or &quot;sloppy&quot; is a sad exscuse for a music fan. I, for one, will continue to play the hell out of this CD for the rest of my life, just as I have since it's release in '91.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|\\"Donnie Darko\\" is very original and thought-provoking.  I heard a lot of hype about this film before I saw it,(including the customer reviews on this site), which usually leads to disappointment.  Surprisingly, it was better than the hype.  Read the reviews below, and ignore iLLMATiC81 \\"BK-BASS-81\\"'s opinion,  it is simply laughable.  Donnie Darko is every bit as good as its praise, and better.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|Rather than a fullscale review, I just want to convey that after listening to the &quot;Say You Will&quot; CD about 50x, I think it ranks as one of the best &quot;return&quot; albums by any of the top 70s/80s rock bands. I am simply amazed at the quality of Stevie Nicks voice -- her vocal depth, intonation, and complexity has gotten better with age. I have several other FM albums (Rumours, Best of, etc.) and for a FM fan, this is a must have item.
0385508417|5.0|Nearly 800 reviews have been posted on Skipping Christmas. This book clearly has been widely read. If you spend a few minutes reading the reviews, you will not need (want?) to read Grisham's tale. Skip the reviews.<br /><br />You either like Grisham books or do not. If you do like Grisham and have a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book - even in August.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A stuffy accountant (Luther Krank) calculates exactly how much the family spent on Christmas the preceding year and discusses it with a partner at work. If you know an accountant (or are one) you can imagine how Grisham's description of these events could be simply hysterical. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Mr. Krank decides he would rather skip Christmas and spend the money saved on a Caribbean cruise. Now if he can only sell his wife on the notion. The convincing, then doing it and dealing with the neighbors and seemingly the whole town is the substance of this book.<br /><br />It is a short story that is rapidly read. I laughed more than once until my eyes watered.

B000062XFG|3.0|Although better than the first season of Star Trek TNG, season 2 was extremely hot and cold.  A few great episodes, such as 'Contagion', 'A Measure of a Man', and 'The Emissary' (as well as a few more) make this season worth having.  Overall, I found Worf, Data and Picard to be fairly steady characters throughout this season, but the others seemed to waver quite a bit (I think the actors did a great job - it's as if the writers kept changing the characters on them!). <br /> <br />The character of Dr. Pulaski - although the actress herself did a great job - was simply repulsive and inconsistent to me.  She seemed extremely bigoted one minute, and then suddenly would become this selfless person rushing to someone's aid.  Then in another episode she would be portrayed as incredibly stubborn.  Writers, make up your minds!  The way she acted made me question why or how she would become the chief medical doctor on a starship, especially the Enterprise where she truly did not fit in.  The character of Dr. Crusher, re-introduced in season 3, was far better and more consistent, while also interacting more believably with the crew.  Once again, I emphasize that the acting was actually quite good - the writing was inconsistent. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there is some good character development throughout this season for most of the bridge crew, with the exception of Riker who was also portrayed inconsistently.  I must also admit that Wesley Crusher tends to get on my nerves - needing a young teenager to get the federation flagship out of trouble multiple times does not make any sense.  However, there was some decent development between him and Picard. <br /> <br />If you have not seen any of this series yet, I would strongly recommend not starting with this season.  But, for all you out there who have seen and enjoyed it, there are some great episodes in here.
B00005ATQH|5.0|This is a sublime adaptation of Nabokov ' s novel . This a controversial story of a man in the critical age who suddenly is infauted with a &quot;nymphet&quot; . Satiric script around the consequences derivated from an unhappy decision .<br /><br /> In the cinema story we must to remind The blue angel (Joseph von Sternberg) that is very close in that spirit and Tristana (Luis Bu&ntilde;uel) about another novel of Benito Perez Galdos and more recently the famous Sam Mendes film American beauty .<br /><br /> In this case the perpetual and present of the nymphet in the emotional , afective and disturbing world of a man in the middle age causes a fatal atraction that slowly will be growing in intensity and high caliber drama . The reflections about the double moral about the thin line between the rol of father and passionate man are difuse. James Mason made one of his best works in the screen and Peter Sellers is amazing too . And considering Kubrick as director , How can you lose this game?<br /><br /> Superb!
B000002O1P|4.0|(Actual Rating- 3.5 Stars)<br /> Southern Accents(1985). Tom Petty And The Heartbreaker's Fifth Album.<br /><br /> After releasing the Multi-Platinum album 'Hard Promises', Tom Petty and Co. went back to record 'Southern Accents', which would become their most experimental and, some would say, worst album. 'Southern Accents' took a long, hard three years to complete, and at its worst, Tom Petty broke his hand after slamming it into a wall, frustrated over the CD's mixing. Upon its release in 1985, 'Southern Accents' peaked at #7, riding on the heels of hit single 'Don't Come Around Here No More', yet again becoming another Multi-Platinum smash for Tom Petty. But despite the commercial success, many fans were displeased with the album's experimental aspect, which found the band branching out to include Soul, Psychadelia, and New Wave. So, is 'Southern Accents' another solid release from Tom Petty, or an experimental disaster? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> Rebels- \\"Rebels\\" finds Tom Petty as his usual self, blending Country sensibilities and lyrics with catchy, hooky acoustic guitar riffs with his commanding vocals, much like \\"Refugee\\". A good track.<br /><br /> It Ain't Nothing To Me- \\"It Ain't Nothing To Me\\" builds up slowly, with a catchy sax solo and Petty's slightly distorted vocals singing behind a typical New Wave beat. The Disco-y chorus is a nice touch to a good song.<br /><br /> Don't Come Around Here No More- \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" is 'Southern Accents' big hit, and it's no surprise! A catchy, New Wave-y synthesizer beat backs up Petty's drawling, yet oddly addictive vocals. Excellent usage of a backup choir and Synthesizer's make \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" an excellent and catchy monster hit!<br /><br /> Southern Accents- \\"Southern Accents\\" begins behind a subtle Classical Piano and Petty's brooding vocals. As this ballad progresses, slight touches of an acoustic guitar and a violin are added in. \\"Southern Accents\\" quickly gets boring though, as the slowness and repetitiveness really begin to show.<br /><br /> Make It Better(Forget About Me)- \\"Make It Better(Forget About Me)\\" reminds me of Huey Lewis and The News, starting off with a chugging guitar riff combined with Saxophones, Keyboards, and Organs, not to mention Petty's upbeat vocals. A solid rocker with some interesting instument use.<br /><br /> Spike- \\"Spike\\" is a Psychadelic Rocker along the lines of The Doors, using Petty's sneering vocals behind a slow, placid keyboard beat(Much like The Doors) and short bursts of an acoustic guitar. Quickly gets repetitive and boring after hearing the same thing over and over though makes \\"Spike\\" an average track.<br /><br /> Dogs On The Run- \\"Dogs On The Run\\" builds up, starting off with Gospel-y organs and Petty's accented vocals, but it soon adds in a catchy, bluesy guitar riff to make \\"Dogs On The Run\\" a good Gospel influenced rocker.<br /><br /> Mary's New Car- \\"Mary's New Car\\" sounds almost like The Clash, using a subtle, catchy, punky riff, combining Keyboards and Saxaphones, and puts Petty's sarcastic vocals and weird lyrics to good use. Interesting song.<br /><br /> The Best of Everything- \\"The Best of Everything\\" is a Soul-influenced ballad, putting heavy use of the melodic keyboard, not to mention Horns and Saxophones to use to create a repetitive, heartfelt ballad that gets a tad boring when all's said and done.<br /><br /> Overall, 'Southern Accents' is a solid Tom Petty album, yet, unlike his previous albums, it seems like a lot of the energy's missing, putting more emphasis on anything but Rock N Roll. While it has its moments, 'Southern Accents' songs, with the exception of \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\", are good, solid rockers, yet there's nothing all that interesting or special about them. I would say it would be worth the purchase if you highly enjoyed the song \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\", but, then again, you can always get that off a Hits Compilation.<br /><br /> RECOMMENDED TO ROCK, NEW WAVE, COUNTRY, AND TOM PETTY FANS. A GOOD, SOLID ALBUM, YET NOTHING SPECIAL LIKE PETTY'S EARLIER ALBUMS.<br /><br />Killer Kuts- \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\"<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> Long After Dark- Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers<br /> Street Survivors- Lynyrd Skynyrd<br /> .38 Special- .38 Special<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!M, YET NOTHING SPECIAL LIKE PETTY'S EARLIER ALBUMS.

B00004YA0T|5.0|To win conducting Bruckner demands from a director several issues . You must have a first order orchestra ; second your rapport with the orchestra ; third Bruckner symphonies are a real challenge they are real difficult works because you have to maintain the sound all along the work ; fourth: the different mood changes and the running time of every symphony demands a serious analysis and commitment with the inspired and rapture melodic lines inmersed ; fifth : to underline and emphasize the sforzandos , the dramatic accents are almost an epic achievement ; sixth : since the undeniable influenc of Wagner in Bruckner you have to keep the balance and obviously to have studied Wagner in every work and consider the fact if Wagner would have lived twenty years more Would it sound in the brucknerian mood?  and if all the previous factors were not enough , you have to consider the giant directors in Bruckner : Wilhelm Furtwangler , Hans Knappersbutch , Jasha Horenstein ,Carl Suricht , Horst Stein and obviously Eugene Jochum and the most remarkable Bruckner conductor in the actual times : Daniel Barenboim .<br />Jochum was a noble man and he had another important point to his favour : the orchestra : placed in the East Germany kept his sound due the isolation in the thirties forties and fifties . I underline this because the character and presence of similar orchestras as the Gewandhaus of Leipzig let obtain a pure sound ; and not a traditional vision .<br />This set is relevant in your collection because the standard level of every work is very high and often inspired . So it is easier for you to make a musical journey all the way.<br />I really recommend to you .
B00005RDRO|3.0|The last time I saw this movie during it's original theatrical run back in 1976 (3 or 4 times actually) when I was a kid. I thought it was the funniest movie I had ever seen. I revisited it on DVD recently for the first time since then and my enthusiasm for it has waned some. It's still a very funny picture. Most of the jokes are hit or miss, but there's enough there to justify a recommendation. Peter Falk and Peter Sellers are the standouts in a uniformly good comic cast. I certainly like this infinitely better than the more &quot;serious&quot; comedies Neil Simon wrote for Marsha Mason (&quot;Goodbye Girl&quot;, please!).

0783231032|2.0|I saw &quot;1941&quot; as a teenager during it's original theatrical run. At that time I thought it was loud and chaotic and only sporadically funny. Before you had a chance to laugh something else was getting blown-up or destroyed. If I didn't particularly like this movie in the first place why would I purchase it on DVD? Because, I've come to believe that Spielberg has become possibly our greatest American director and I thought maybe I had missed something in this early work. Guess what? I didn't. The movie has a number of great actors in it's cast but there is so much mayhem and screaming going on that they get lost in the shuffle. The movie's nominal star, John Belushi, plays what is essentially a pale shadow of his &quot;Bluto&quot; role in Animal House. The movie's obvious inspiration is &quot;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; but &quot;1941&quot; makes that film look like a drawing-room comedy. However, do I recommend this movie? Well, there are a few laughs amid the chaos and if you are interested in the development of Spielberg's career(this is not his worst movie;that honor goes to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;). <br /> Also, if you are interested in the career of Robert Zemeckis, he co-scripted this film.

B00005JKJA|4.0|I thought this was an interesting film noir about love and competition in Hollywood, in ex-Eagle Don Henley's phrase.  In the course of the film lead actress Naomi Watts is transformed from an ingenue, freshly arrived from Canada and all agog over her prospects as an actress in Hollywood after winning a jitterbug contest, to a spooked, depressed,jaded, disheveled, and humiliated woman who has also been spurned by her lesbian lover, Camilla, the film's other female lead. So jealous is she that she arranges to have her lover shot. The film is \\"looped\\" in a surrealistic fashion so that the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end, much like the film \\"Memento\\". The film follows some tortuous dreamlike sequences; in fact the whole movie is a dream experienced by Betty.  The film is a masterpiece of horror and  includes numerous short scenes concerning  underworld characters, detectives,a cowboy,the landlady, and important Hollywood types most of whom turn out to be relevant to the main plot.  There are numerous auditions, a hatbox full of money, and a mysterious square blue box which opens with a blue key. Rita a.k.a. Camilla is a voluptuous brunette and successful actress who becomes an amnesiac following an accident on Mulholland Drive, and newly arrived blonde Betty a.k.a. Diane attempts to help her regain her identity. While it appears early in the film that Betty and Rita will become good friends, it turns out exactly the opposite in the film's diametrically opposed second half. The first half of the film is bright, bathed in colorful light, and quite optimistic, mostly because of Watts' stellar performance as a young, aspiring actress. But whether this is dream or reality is unclear. The film's second half is equally bleak and almost hedonistic, among other qualities. It reminds me of Hitchcock's \\"Psycho.\\" Because time and action in the movie are surrealistic, we can only begin to piece together the story by the end of the movie.  The story is ultimately one of high expectations, jealousy,betrayal and certainly not the least lesbian love. There is no explicable reason why Diane should not be successful, but her Aunt Ruth is her only ally--and she uses Ruth's insurance money to pay off a hired gun. At Adam's dinner party, it is almost as if he and Camilla (and a second Camilla,as well)and Adam's mother  are all mocking her.      Camilla's notable success as an actress might be attributed to reverse discrimination; Adam's success as a director might be attributed to his conversation with the cowboy and to his consequent decision to cast the other Camilla in a lead role.      There are some scenes in the movie that appear to be somewhat gratuitous: for example, the scenes at the diner where a man claims to have seen a monster out back in a dream, and the monster man nightmarishly appears around a corner, and also appears later in the film with two little men who wind up in Diane Selwyn's apartment, appear designed mostly to spook the viewer.Likewise the scene where the director, angry over finding his wife in bed with another man, pours red paint over her jewelry.  But such techniques have been used by other directors. Diane's sad suicide is possibly more the rule than the exception in Tinseltown.
B00005NGZX|5.0|A band that has been around for quite a while & still  releasing original songs nonstop as well as always having crystal clear production...In every album which none are weak or dissapointing, at all. Jane doe, has  some of the most brilliant deliverence yet and i haven't realy heard such an intense sound from another band todate and i don't think i ever will. For every one into pure & not generic hardcore,noise, &,grind all mix together without being one bit terrible but actullie a masterpiece!
B00005JMAH|4.0|Better then the other 2 but still it remains a movie you can enjoy, but has its flaws.  The story is good, the performances are better, the f/x are great, and overall its a fun movie.  They could have used a better quidditch match, and the ending could use a little more adventure, it was too short.  Buckbeak and the werewolf are the best. 8 out of a 10. Goblet of fire should prove better, they have a new director who is plannin on having dragons and more quidditch.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Len Wiseman's Underworld has to be taken for what it is: an action film dressed up in goth-couteur with vampires and werewolves. This film doesn't have the scares of other films that include either a vampire or a werewolf or both. It is without any kind of apology a dark, gothic action film.<br /><br />Underworld's story owes alot to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and White Wolf Gaming's Werewolf: Rage and Vampire the Masquerade. Any fans of those two pen-and-paper urban gothic role-playing game would see alot of similarities in Wiseman's film. The film starts off pretty quickly and doesn't really let up until the final scene. There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath. These scenes would be just as good as the action sequences if not for the scenery-chewing of Shane Brolly's Kraven. Looking like a stereotypical Euro-trash vampire, Brolly's Kraven doesn't know the meaning of understated acting. Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in-character.<br /><br />The person who really holds the film together was Kate Beckinsale. Who knew that she could be convincing as an action-heroine. Her petite form and soft-spoken demeanor actually gives her ass-kicking character some sex-appeal and both fuses well together. It didn't hurt that she pretty much spent almost the entire lenght of the film in some outfit that was all black, and either leather or latex or a combination of both. Ms. Beckinsale is both hot and dangerous in this film.<br /><br />The action sequences owes alot of The Matrix and the other imitators that showed up after the release of that film. Unlike, most Matrix imitators, Underworld doesn't overuse the slo-mo, 360-degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular. The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them. But overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.<br /><br />Len Wiseman has already announced that Underworld 2 will be made once everyone involved in the first film get their schedules straightened out. The ending of this film really needs a sequel to continue the story that really just started with this film. Underworld is fun and a rollercoaster of a goth-action-thriller.overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.

B00006LJ72|3.0|I love Enya's music. She'll be remebered as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. My gripe is that there's just collections of old stuff and hardly anything new here. As a first Enya collection it's fine but when will we see an all new album with all new material? Has Enya run out of inspiration or has she got composer's cramp? This is the kind of stunt we see every now and then from old rockers when they start to run low on cash.

B0000028W9|5.0|This was the first Leonard Cohen album I ever listened to. And almost the last album I ever listened to - everything else seems mundane afterwards. Even such a musical luminary as David Gilmour considers this the best album of the 90s. <br /> <br />Some might puzzle about the master songwriter including a couple of covers. Some might gripe about his lyrics and disagree with his philosophy and politics. Some might even object to the military march beat that appears in Democracy. But there's no escaping the way Leonard's voice wraps itself about you and spirits you away to some other mysterious place. I cannot understand all of Leonard's lyrics, and to try to interpret them seems pointless. But they paint vivid pictures in my mind, invoke my emotions and tantalise my thoughts. Tacoma Trailer works as well as any Cohen piece with words, and illustrates Leonard's underrated musicianship. <br /> <br />I love this album and all its imperfections. I love Leonard and all of his.
B00012FXB8|3.0|Alien 3 has the unfortunate task of trying to live up to Ridley Scott's excellent Alien and James Cameron's equally thrilly Aleins. First-time director David Fincher was handed the reins by the Alien franchise's producers and tries to live up to the Alien franchise's pedigree.<br /><br />Fincher's direction of this third leg of the Alien Quadrilogy can't be faulted for this film's weakness when compared to the first two Alien films. Fincher's career after Alien 3 can attest to the fact that this man has very great directing skills i.e. The Game, Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room. I place the blame for this leg of the Quadrilogy wholly on the team of writers who decided to go away from the conclusion of Aliens go their own disastrous way. I would applud such a daring move if it made sense, but discarding of certain characters that became such a huge part of the franchise was just idiotic. These writers could have easily taken a look at the excellent Dark Horse Comic series that continued the Alien story after Cameron's film and set it on Earth. Now that would've been a film that I'd rather see have been made under Fincher's direction.<br /><br />The acting in Alien 3 is actually very good. Once again, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley becomes the bedrock upon which the rest of the cast rallies around. Charles Dance's inmate-doctor Clemens does a great job of creating an early repoirte with Ripley. But the stand-out of the film has to be Charles S. Dutton's character of Dillon: the spiritual leader of the prison colony of Fury. Dutton's portrayal of Dillon was very powerful and one could actually see the righteous anger seething just beneath the surface.<br /><br />The film's tone borrows more from Scott's Alien than Cameron's sequel. Right from the start the tension begins and once the Alien is born and starts hunting the prisoners and prison staff members, the film begins to start moving. The CG work on the Alien-dog hybrid looks dated when seen in this dvd edition, even after some digital remastering. But the close-ups puppetry and animatronics is as good if not better than what was in Aliens.<br /><br />The ending of the film does take abit too long to unfold when seen in the theaters, but when seen in the comforts of one's own home its easier to tolerate. Alien 3 is the most spiritual of the 4 films in the Quadrilogy, a very good scifi thriller and overall the film would've stood well if just judge on its own merits. But one cannot judge an Alien film without at least some comparison to the rest of the Quadrilogy's films. On that note, Alien 3 has to be the weakest of the bunch. I'd recommend this film for scifi and Alien aficionados, but for casual film fans I say rent it first and see what you think.ven after some digital remastering.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I will pay for the original films on DVD but not these 're-makes'.  How great were the original Ewok toons that got replaced in these versions?  How LAME does it look when Han is confronted by Jabba at Mos Eisley??  I have seen more realistic special effects on Saturday morning cartoons.
B00004YYDI|5.0|French filmmaker Luc Besson's film about a young pubescent girl and her neighbor who happens to be a \\"cleaner\\" (another name for assassin) is not just an action-film of operatic proportion, but also a poignant story of friendship and love. Leon works well as both and would probably be relegated to a run-of-the-mill actioneer if it lost that humanity.<br /><br />Luc Besson's casting of Natalie Portman as the Lolita-esque Matilda is perfect. I can't pciture this young girl character being played by anyone else. Ms. Portman was still 12 or 13 when she made this film, but she comes across very mature and sure of herself as an actress. What is even more surprising is that Leon is her very first work. Jean Reno as the title character is also a great choice. He is both physically-imposing in a lean and hungry way rather than hulking like Schwarzenneger or Stallone. His character is interesting in that he is almost perfect as an assassin, but very immature socially and almost child-like outside his profession. In the pairing of Matilda and Leon, it is Matilda who comes off as the adult of the pair. The one who ends up showing Leon what the world has to offer outside his profession as a hired killer.<br /><br />The scenes where Matilda and Leon interact are both raw and powerful. There is a certain taboo feeling to seeing a young pubescent girl getting so close to an older man and Besson doesn't push away from it. He hints that there may be something more between these two interesting characters, but he leaves it to the viewer's own imagination to decide if there is.<br /><br />Outside of these two greats actors, the other cast member who almost steals the entire film is Gary Oldman as the corrupt drug enforcement cop Stansfield. Oldman's portrayal of this law enforcement agent \\"gone native\\" -- so to speak -- is one reason to watch Leon. Oldman straddles the line between mad-genius and caricature. His talent pretty much keeps him on the former instead of the latter. Stansfield has to rank up there as one of the better villains ever put on film. Without Oldman's character there would be no venegeance-fueled motivations for Matilda and certainly no paternal feelings of protection from Leon concerning her.<br /><br />The action sequences owes alot to the ballet-style of gunfights made popular by the Hong Kong films of John Woo. Besson's looks abit more grittier and harsher than Woo's style, but Besson still keeps the sequences very operatic. The fact that Besson has admitted to being a huge fan of John Woo and his work makes it easier to see the influences.<br /><br />This uncut international version of the film is the definitive dvd edition to buy. The extra 20 or so minutes of re-edited scenes really explains more of the dynamic relationship between Matilda and Leon. These extra scenes give the climactic finale more of an emotional impact than the U.S. theatrical version. The video and audio have been totally remastered and it shows when shown on a nice home theater system setup. The Superbit Edition even goes further but sacrifices all the supplemental features to do so. Either international dvd editions will do, with the Superbit being best for those who dont care too much for supplemental extras but do care for the best picture and sound in their dvds.<br /><br />Leon: The Professional ranks as one of the best intelligent action films in my book. It easily belongs in the same league as Woo's Hard Boiled and The Killer and Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Luc Besson may not be well-known outside of Europe and Asia, but he is a talent that Hollywood should look to more in the future.tansfield has to rank up there as one of the better villains ever put on film.

0195067142|5.0|I loved this book.  Among the many celebrated books covering WWII, this one seems to receive comparatively little attention, the positive reviews on this board notwithstading.  Sledge gives a very humble and vivid account of what it was really like to be in battle against the Japanese in the Pacific in WWII.  It simply amazes me when I read of the conditions under which so many of these battles were fought.  I highly recommend this book.
B00005JNEI|5.0|its funny how most people say that this was a bit over hyped but according to the 9/11 commission report the facts are there.. <br />  <br /> The September 11 Commission's 567-page final report has confirmed key facts presented in Fahrenheit 9/11. These include: <br />  <br /> Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265  <br />  <br /> After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, he went ahead with his classroom event. After Bush was informed that the nation was under attack after the second plane hit, Bush stayed in the classroom for nearly seven more minutes, continuing to read with the children. Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 35, 38-39.  <br />  <br /> Bush failed to have even one meeting to discuss the threat of terrorism with his head of counterterrorism Richard Clarke. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 201.  <br />  <br /> Bush failed to react to the August 6, 2001 security briefing, \\"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S. Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 260-262.  <br />  <br /> 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country after September 13. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 556, n. 25 [Note that Fahrenheit 9/11 understates the number of Saudis who left.]  <br />  <br /> Individuals were interviewed by the FBI before being allowed to leave (although the report confirms that most individuals on these flights were not interviewed.) Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 557, n. 28.  <br />  <br /> White House former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke approved these flights. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329. <br />  <br /> It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including: <br />  <br /> What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly were the flights arranged by the U.S. government?  <br />  <br /> Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: \\"At a time when 14 of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections.\\"  <br />  <br /> Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew of Osama bin Laden, who &quot;was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth&quot; (WAMY), which the FBI has described as \\"a suspected terrorist organization,\\" and that the bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that \\"has been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps traveling with President Bush.\\"
B00005JNEI|5.0|I attended the premier night of this film in Rochester, NY with a group of 87 people.  It was a historic event.   <br /> <br />All showings in the area were sold out.  The unbiased reviews of this film can only dispute some minor time sequences, but by and large, this film is factual.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure this film fits the description of documentary because Michael Moore is way more talented than the run of the mill film maker.  The movie is informative, entertaining and eye opening.  Overall, the film asks only one thing:  THINK.   <br /> <br />We collected all the ticket stubs from everyone in the theater and mailed them to GW Bush.... <br /> <br />This film is the \\"must see\\" movie for everyone who truly believes in democracy.
0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of wrath is John Steinbecks masterpiece. That he never again wrote an opus of this caliber is of little matter. few others have,either before of since. Steinbeck tells the tale of America during the Depression,by making one family come to life,the Joads. Now a part of the american Lexicon due to the movie of the same name[and a later bruce Sprinsteen album,the ghost of tom joad},the Joads are once proud Oklahoma famers devastated by the dust bowl droughts of the 1930's[which Steinbeck describes brilliantly.} They gather together, tie up their meager belongings, and head out furthe west to California, the land of opportunity. Needless to say, their plight mirrors that of literally millions during that decade, and theier reception in California is less than welcoming. They fight with crooked cops,abusive migrant bosses and &quot;instigators&quot; in camps,until they finally find a labor camp that treats them, and others as human beings. The Joads,in their utter despair and poverty,retain, even ennoble the human condition, by growth and compassion and kindness. There are tow ways people react to adversity, to lash out or reach out. the Joads become, then, paradoxically,with their poverty and rough edges, the quintessential Americans:tough, undogmatic,principled,compassionate,not looking to take advantage even when the opportunity presents itself. The final scenes, with Tom forced to go on the run again,the final conversation between Tom and his Ma are astonishing, and Sharona {the roseofsahrona, as she is referred to] nursing a dying man with her breat milk intended for her stillborn baby, is as unforgettable as exists in all Literature. If Moby Dick is not the great american novel, then this is. One of the very very few pieces of literature as relevant as when it was written. as Masterpiece, a galaxy full of stars would not suffice, never mind 5 stars. MAGNIFICENT,UFORGETTABLE.A MASTERPIECE.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie is definately one of the most unique and stylish films of the year.  Uma Thurman, and the rest of the cast pack a punch unlike any kung fu film ever made.  The action is non stop with a lot of blood shed and stylized martial arts.  The story itself is interesting even if there were no action.  You develop a hate for the villains of the film before you meet them.  The bad guys by the way are Vivica Fox, Daryll Hannah, and Lucy Liu.  Quintin Tarantino should keep doing films because he gets more innovative and more original with each movi he makes.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna is truely one of the most talented artists on this planet, and American Life really displays this.  It is my favorite album, besides the Immaculate Collection. Her songs are so unqiue, and her voice is one-of-a-kind.  She is my favoirte, and anybody looking for great music should definately consider one of Madonna's many albums.
B00005JM02|5.0|Expecting your average Pixar film, I walked into the theater without knowing how wonderful this film really is.  Even with the technological backgrounds and modern storytelling, this film reminded of older Disney classics.  It will never be forgotten.  The highlight is the absent minded fish, Dorie who could've ONLY been brought to life by the brilliant Ellen Degeneres.  Even if you feel you are too old to see this movie see it anyway because I think that it will appeal to adults even more than the kiddie crowd.  The DVD is wonderful, especially the transfer.  This is one of the best films of 2003, a must see.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore did exhaustive research to put this movie together. Yes, he has his opinions but aside from sarcastic conjecture every single claim is true... just because FOXNEWS reported this movie to be a two-hour lie does not make it so. Try this link [...] <br /> it will take you to the michaelmoore site where he has provided a bibliography of sorts for his movie (in it's entirety it prints to nearly thirty pages if you're on someone elses computer) Agree or not with the politics it is a well-put-together attack on the president. The most damning things in the film is footage of the president; making faces like a six-year old at the television monitors before announcing THE INVASION OF IRAQ... A NATION SO POWERFUL THAT THE US ENFORCED NO-FLY ZONES THERE FOR A DECADE WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE. Or the time when after he gives an impassioned address to the media that the world needs to unite against terror then he invites them to &quot;...now watch this drive!&quot; as he steps up to show off his golf prowess. Or maybe the seven minutes he sat while New York crumbled! Doing nothing! Yeah, that's strong leadership through difficult times if I ever saw it! If you plan to bash the film please see it first - Dale Jr. said that every American should see it and for once I agree with the face of NASCAR.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Packing less punch than the first and third installments this sequel to the 2001 blockbuster still carries the story of the ring well.  In this film there is more special effects, and battle sequences and we are introduced to two new fantastical characters.  First there is the cryptic Treebeard, and then there is the outrageously believable creature Gollum.  The characters develop more as well, and you also meet more human characters including the Riders of Rohan and Ghandalf the White.  The DVD is also wonderful spectacle to watch.  This will definately be a remembered film for years to come.
B00008EY65|5.0|Glenda Findley said it best, \\"we were all young once, try looking at this movie through the eyes of an 8 year-old\\".  Don't ever believe because you age, your inner child must fade away.  The newest reviews, stated that there was too much emotional or mental bagage...that's talk of narcissistic, self-righteous, over-zealous, egomaniacs, who are more or less likely not to keep in touch with their inner child, feelings, emotions or the sensitivity of others.  I couldn't disagree MORE!  It is because of the emotional/mental torment that makes these characters so lovable and easy to relate to.  I agree, there were many clich&eacute;s, and \\"one-liners\\" used time and time again in this crazy Western popular culture of ours...but remember that this is simply entertainment: take it for what it is and nothing more!<br />The special effects were spectacular, and as explained in the Bonus DVD are wonderfully executed, thought-out and well planned.  This movie does deliver the best eye candy I've seen in a while, in terms of special effects.  And it was thoroughly enjoyed by most.<br />I congratulate Guillero Del Toro, for staying as faithful as he possibly could to the comic book - which by the way is based on the \\"Seed of Destruction\\" series.<br />Although such characters like Abe Sapien (Doug Evans), Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) are not developed enough.  I thought it wasn't necessary.(...)<br />Liz Sherman (for whatever reason's character and acting ability continues to be undermined by her beauty - again by crazy misogynists) represents the severely depressed, yet terribly intelligent, charming, compassionate and giving.  Her abilities similar to Abe Sapien's, can only be accessed when they are heightened by emotions/feelings/energies.  She is profound, an intellect, sensitive, a thinker, and independent of any one being: her full self.  Her character although not fully developed is still essential to the story line.  Let's remember that if we develop each and every character to such a wide extent that ALL MOVIES would take more than 4 hours + (remember Queen of the Damned).  Her depression stems from the fact that she is a very profound intellect and detached of any selfishness, pride, ego, or superficial trappings.  Her emotions/senses are the reasons why she can utilize her pyrokinetic abilities.  This is because she has a deeper range of emotions, that connects her to all living things.<br />Ron Perlman, was brilliant as Hellboy.  No other human being in the world could have played such a well-developed character.  I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role.  It was made for him perfectly and he is stunning that makeup.  No one else could have looked that well in \\"lobster\\" makeup.  He delivers his performance brilliantly.  Even those over-used \\"one-liners\\" seem brand new when said by Ron Perlman.  Nothing to say except : Perfect Performance.  A+++<br />John Hurt as Hellboy's \\"father\\" was a joy to watch as well.  Like any father, he cares for his son...and raised him to do by right although Hellboy is \\"hell itself\\".  Proving that we can all do away with that side of ourselves if we work hard at it.<br />Jeffrey Tambour as the boss, delivered the best performance he could, given the script he had to work with.  The one thing I must mention about this character is that, often times, when he seemed perturbed by Hellboy's personality...it didn't quite \\"feel\\" right...it felt forced and was delivered simply as an \\"add on\\".  His character is made to be believed by the audience that he will not be intimidated by a hell-born creature, that he will always be the \\"Boss\\" of everyone and no other man or creature for that matter could take his place!  His character is suppose to represent the egomaniac, power-hungry-obsessed \\"boss\\" who doesn't give Hellboy a rest...but that doesn't quite flush out perfectly enough!<br />The cinematography is enjoyable for the most part.  The pacing is reasonably well.  The only thing that needed work for themost part are the villains.  They had to be a thousand times for threatening...even the monsters Sammael are not demonic enough to frighten anyone in any subway!  I believe, all in all, that the villains needed the most development as characters...but everything else is just fine.<br />What's best about this action super-hero/heroine movie is that the characters are FLAWED, that's what makes them so special and unique and more importantly human.  Hellboy is madly in love with Liz, but terribly insecure when Agent Myers spends time with her for a coffee on a bench, even goes as far as throwing a small rock at his head!  That was delightful...even the conversation he carries with the 9 year-old boy.  It shows that beneath that machochistic exterior, there really is a wonderful Hellboy inside.  All of these characters (except the villains of course), have inner demons to deal with...even Father has an ailing heart that he refuses to reveal to his son, in fear of making him upset.  It's the humanity in these characters that makes them so easy to relate to...Superman and Spiderman are superficial garbage...with little or no substance...Superman comes from another planet...I can hardly relate to that.  And I wouldn't want to.  If being perfect and well thought out, is being selfish, an over-zealous egomaniac, with little concern for others except yourself, then don't watch this movie because by that definition, this movie would surely suck!<br />I love seeing that these are not your typical \\"heroes\\", they are imperfect and it's the flaws that make people perfect and strive to make people better themselves...to be perfect, which doesn't even exist, logically, then there really would be no point in living.  But striving to achieve perfection, gives you meaning and purpose to your life and something worth thinking about.<br />They don't even look like your typical heroes.  It's wonderful to see an \\"X-File research an X-File\\" or as other people have mentioned \\"X-Men meets the X-Files\\"...there's an original idea.  This movie just explains Hellboy's origins, and what he's about.  The sequel will, no doubt, offer more in terms of plot.  I remember the first X-Men wasn't anything much, because so much of it, just explained their origin and what they were.  It's the same with this movie.  And it is the best thing we've seen this year so far (considering how deplorable movies have become over the years).<br />The Bonus DVD includes wonderful features, from commentary to deleted scenes, to Mike Mignola's explanation of his original creation...it was wonderful.<br />Great effects, well enough plot, reasonable pacing and cinematography, developed characters with the exception of the villains...but over all, different, unique, and certain a different take on superheroes.<br />By the way: The big hand is a Stone Hand.  He never really uses it for what it's made for because Hellboy was raised by humans.  The Stone Hand is used to unlock the \\"portal\\" to set Behemoth free of its crystal prison.  In the human world, he just uses it to smash things.<br />The most unforgettable thing is the relationship between Hellboy and Liz...they did after all grow up together as \\"freaks\\" of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense as children.  Her \\"power\\" is pyrokinesis, and he is fire-proof.  It's no wonder they are the perfect match.  I wonder what their children would be like \\"half-hellish half-human\\"....<br />The most important thing I've learned from this movie is that our imperfections make us who we are.  As far as I'm concerned, to have no \\"baggage\\" at all, is to experience nothing and to learn nothing...and to agree to refuse to \\"disconnect\\" and remain ego-centric.  Sure, \\"baggage\\" has to flush out, but new \\"baggages\\" must arrive at the airport some time soon, giving us reasons to exist and to learn and to grow.  It's a continual process...I liked that these heroes were not \\"clean-cut\\" or the stereotypes of what heroes are supposedly meant to be.<br/>Can't wait for the sequel!<br />My rating: Excellenthe X-Files\\"...there's an original idea.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|This film turned out to be a whole lot better than I expected.  I had heard that the film was slow, the acting was bland, and the action to boring, but turns out this movie is pretty good.  Russell Crowe plays Jack Aubrey well, and the other acting is great too.  The plot may not be full of excitement and action, but the film has brilliant special effects and realism that will keep the audience occupied. I disagreed with the Best Picture nomination and some of the other Oscar nods.  That is the only thing I disagree with about the movie. The DVD is packed with extras and the digital transfer is amazing.  I reccomend this movie for Russell Crowe fans and epic lovers.
6304712499|4.0|While most would agree that &quot;Spawn&quot; had potential but never truly amounted to anything much...I would have to disagree.  When the film first found its way into theaters in 1997, most critics gave this flick 7 out of 10 stars.  It really wasn't as dreadful as I had anticipated.  To begin with, Spawn is a wonderful, exciting creation, created by Canada's own: Todd McFarland.  <br />The story of &quot;Spawn&quot; centres around Al Simmons, the highest-trained assasin for the CIA, the coldest of cold-blooded killers whose sole mission is to serve his country.  When his superior betrays him, in exchange for a Heat-16 device, that when triggered will blow the world to oblivion, in order to dominate the world, his soul is sent directly to Hell where he is told in order to regain whatever is left of his humanity, his identity and his wife, he must lead Satan's army in the bid to kick-start the Apocalypse.  Satan's lieutenant, his right-hand &quot;clown&quot;, fuels his anger in a bid to direct it toward Jason Wynn, in an attempt to have him killed setting off the Heat-16 device, starting the Apocalypse.  Wynn is told Spawn is a supernatural creature that must be stopped so he can take control of the world and gain all its riches, not letting him get in the way.<br />Satan's bid is to pit one against the other, so His plans to created the Eden of Armageddon on Earth.  Spawn is left with the choice of having to fight his inner demons and use his supernatural abilities to overcome whatever evil has begot him.  The central point that needs to be emphasized is that Spawn is a character who has to find a way to save the world, regain his life, without &quot;selling-out&quot; by doing Satan's bidding.  By letting his anger &quot;get to&quot; him, Satan can only use that against him, never fulfilling His promise of having him returned to his wife and a normal human life.  He must find a way of destroying the Heat-16 device, without destroying humanity, therefore not causing Armageddon.  He must channel his thoughts and actions into positivity, where he can focus using his abilities to better humanity without causing too much damage and teach Satan a most valuable lesson: He must do his own &quot;dirty&quot; work himself if he cares that much to kick-start the Apocalypse!  Satan is the ultimate coward in this film.  Spawn is the true winner because he has lost a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; life, must rebuild from the beginning to find his identity and his true meaning in life, all the while fighting Satan and his lieutenant, accept that the woman he loves can no longer be with him and still try to find peace within himself.<br />Unlike, Superman, Spiderman or Batman...Spawn is not &quot;clean-cut&quot; nor &quot;pure&quot;.  He is flawed, he has much learning to do, the creator, as he claimed in the DVD Special Features, did great justice and exemplified true fairness in creating a superhero that did not confine to the stereotype of what superheroes should look or be like.  He was not a rich man who owns millions of dollars and owns most if not all of a city (Batman) from whom we can all get something...He does not come from another planet (Superman) who is seemingly human except for the fact he has powers...and He was not bitten by a Spider and given magical spider abilities.  Spawn/Al Simmons was a just a man working, serving his wife, living life day-by-day, believing he was doing right and trying to make the best of the torment he gained as a result of killing in the name of &quot;good&quot;.<br />Spawn teaches us and shows us that even killing in the name of &quot;good&quot; draws you toward the &quot;dark&quot; side and that we must, all at some point in our lives, find ways of not succumbing to it.  This character has so much depth, and inner torment, and it's this flaw that makes him so exhilarating to watch and follow.  After having watched this flick both when it was released in theatres and on DVD, I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially when I re-examined the character over and over again.<br />There were wonderful performances by Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Martin Sheen and of course Michael Jai White.  The pacing was reasonably well organized, the cinematography, some of the best of seen and the special effects are first rate.<br />The only thing that could have been more developed was Spawn's deep-rooted anguish toward life, himself and the loss of his humanity, and having to strife to make sense of his super-powers.<BR>I thought this movie was actually deserving of a sequel.<br />I do agree that the animated series is amazing and more faithful to the comics...but for an action-packed flick, &quot;Spawn&quot; does deliver...I believe that for most the intelligence required to truly understand the depth of such a character can be quite trying.<br />My rating: Very Very Good.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Nirvana is easily the greatest grunge band ever, if not the greatest band of the 90's. This is a welcome to the unbelievable collection of classic CD's of one of the most influencial bands ever. Huge hits like &quot;Smells like teenspirit&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Heart-shaped box&quot; and many more are on this album plus a brand new song titled &quot;You know you're Right&quot; which is a great song by the way. Also an acoustic version of &quot;All Apologies&quot; taken from the Unplugged album is here, all wrapping up with an acoustic version of David Bowie's &quot;The Man who sold the world&quot;. This album is awesome, some of you Nirvana-haters dont realize that. Do some research and then you'll see why Nirvana ISN'T a punk band and is more metallica then The Sex Pistols (Who are a great band, don't get me wrong). Nirvana did not want to change rock and just wanted to be an average band who would maybe sell 50,000 records. Apparently you Nirvana-haters are really stupid if you cant realize that since it was announced many times on Kurt's interviews... m*****f*****s. Buy this album, its Nirvana.
1559409002|5.0|I really like this Criterion version of Carnival of Souls -- especially all the included background material on the locations and actors. You really get a sense of what it takes to make an independent film. I highly reccomend this DVD to anyone who is a film buff or is a film student.  <br /> <br />However, I recently came across another DVD release of Carnival of Souls that is also very interesting. It features both the original B/W and new Color version of the film, which is suprisingly accurate to both the locations and the mood of the film. It also has an audio commentary by Mike Nelson of MST3K. In addition, there is also an effective 5.1 channel DTS soundtrack. You can find out more info on this version at www offcolorfilms dot com.
B0000844IT|5.0|Ok, by now you know that this movie is an absolute hoot. Turn down the lights, get a good grip on your favorite adult beverage, leave the other hand free for popcorn and let 'er rip!<br /><br /> However, let me suggest AS STRONGLY AS POSSIBLE that you make sure you get one of the following:<br /><br /> - The original release ending.<br /><br /> - The directors cut with the original ending available<br /><br /> Probably like many of you, when I saw the directors cut first come out and read the words &quot;15 extra minutes&quot;, I pretty much went right to the checkout counter. However, the directors cut may give us 15 minutes previously missing but takes away perhaps one of the coolest endings EVER. Whats worse, the directors cut I have does not even include the original ending anywhere on the DVD. Boo hoo!<br /><br /> If everything ran the way I would like to see them, I would get all my extra minutes... with the exception that the directors cut ending stays on the cutting room floor and that awesome theatrical release ending stays where it belongs.<br /><br /> I dunno..... there may be some folks out there who disagree with me on this. But then there are people out there getting their tongues pierced too.<br /><br /> Just kidding... um... tongue piercing is very wise.... really. (NOT)
B0000399WC|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Papillon\\" in the 70's and it kept me interested to find out how did Henri Charriere make out after his great escape. So when I found the book Banco (the story- sequel to Papillon) I read it.  <br /> <br />The movie was great and I have been looking for a copy (either in VHS and DVD formats) for many years in the Philippines but no copy was available. This week I tried to order a copy from Amazon but there was a problem because the distribution of the DVD format is prohibited in the Philippines.  <br /> <br />Though a good number of scenes were depressing,  the portrayal of the  courage and one-singlemindedness of Henri to be free made the movie very interesting. I agree, Steve McQueen should have won the best actor trophy that year. His acting was splendid. <br /> <br />I hope in the near future I could find a copy here in the Philippines or it can be available here at Amazon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I picked up this DVD edition today, and having not seen the film, I was relying on the fact that it was the \\"2-disc edition loaded with features\\" to make it worthwhile if the film happened to be of poor quality. I've read many reviews of this film, and most have butchered it saying that it is a ripoff action film of 'The Matrix' or 'Blade', and that its characters and plot are very weak. This is only partly true. If you watch the film with very high expectations, then yes, you may think of it that way. However, if you accept that it's a film from first-timers Len Wiseman and Danny McBride, and give it some leeway, it can be very entertaining. The one thing I must say is that this film isn't as much of an action film as the creators lead you to believe. Sure, there are action scenes, but they don't overshadow the plot. The action scenes work within the plot, instead of vice versa.      The only notable performance is Kate Beckinsale's. She is excellent as the vampire Selene, and she looks really hot in the tight leather outfit. Other acting in the film is average.      The action scenes in the film are amazing. The big shootouts come at the beginning and end of the film, but there are little action snipits throughout. The reason people have tagged this as a ripoff of 'The Matrix' is that the creators decided to use stop-motion camera styles in some areas. Slow-mo is used in some of the action scenes, and I have to say that it only makes them better.      Bogged down by all its negative reviews, 'Underworld' has nevertheless become another one of my favorite films. The film really is very good, despite what many critics have said. The key to enjoying this movie is to not expect much from it. A worthy plot interwoven with action scenes galore make this film an excellent addition to the genre.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I was desperately trying to summarize all that happens in &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; for this review and was at a loss. To be sure, the film is at times bizarre and quite weird, but also wildly original and inventive. Aside from the general strangeness of the movie, what stayed most with me was what it had to say about forging connections with others and finding meaning in a world that often makes no sense at all. I would recommend reading Brandon Curtis's review of the film at [...] for an articulate take on the movie.
B00025ETIW|2.0|Sinfully indulgent on the pretensions of overnight success My Chemical Romance believed that they would indeed fly with the gods and angels by signing a major lable deal and become likened unto music giants with fat wallets and frequent rotations on MTV and channels that forcefully feed the masses &quot;hand me down&quot; music. But what world is this they stumbled into? Is the intense light outside of the cave to overbearing for their new found source of income? Is the underground going to fogive them for stumbeling into the mass crowd of enthuisiasm that evelopes those who look upon them? Will they fly as eagles or crawl as ants among giants? The answer is yes and no. Though the underground still &quot;stands by their band&quot; they are often to blind to see that they are being hoodwinkled by a band that is watering down a vibrant sound. Yet those who stay faithful still insist that there is an amazing vibe still remaining and a fierce feeling of pride vested in the mass confusion that has become of thier reigning heros. &quot;Which way do we go?&quot; cries the crowd to the leader who faithfully commands attention from the podium. And the leader stands up he says &quot;wherever the hell I lead you.&quot; And you see the analogy or you construe it to your own meaning but we all know that our heros of MCR are being lead down a road of one trick ponies and consistant bait and switch tricks that lead so many to debt and obscurity, the music industry.
B00005T30L|3.0|As some film reviewers have already pointed out, &quot;Ghost World&quot; has been far too overhyped and overrated. I've had my share of teenage angst and general hatred for the world around me, but Enid (Thora Birch) is so unhappy and disdainful of the world around her that it's hard to garner any sympathy for her character. She's mean spirited and believes everyone to be stupid and idiotic. I've no idea if the comic book character upon which the film was based is more sympathetic or well drawn, but Enid left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I do admit to seeing this film a couple of years ago, so my opinion may be different if I were to see it now. I'm not sure though--my overriding feel for the movie was annoyance with Enid's self pitying ways and hoping that she'd get a grip and simply deal with and make something of the world around her.
B00008K7AM|1.0|Offended. I was offended by this movie, but even more offended to find that there were complimentary reviews to accompany it. Oh cursed is the man who created this ship wreck of a movie, I believe that anyone who is involved in this movie will no longer have a career, hey it's called karma! Terrible excuse of a movie, a sheer insult to anyone's intelligence! Walk slowely when you see this, in a mournful spirit for all those who delight in stupidity. Walk slowely in memory of those who gave their lives to cinema, just to have thier memory insulted by thise bilge. Tears fall from my face as I think of the classics defecated on by this, by the numerous movies that dare to challenge this movie in unrivaled stupidity. Walk slowely for the gods of art and expression mourned the day this was created, concieved and thought of. I must take moments of silence for those who saw this and appreciated and wonder why the world accepts stupidity, why we all idly watch stupidity and shallow inanity on television. From celebrity break ups to the very worship of Hollywood &quot;gods&quot; from the faceless masses that support this awfullly offensive material. This is propaganda for stupidity! This is woefully crafted cinema for the delight of morons and 13 year olds! And when all the buildings fall down and common man toss of the chains of oppression and capitalism, we will march to the movie stores and cermoniously destroy each and every copy of this movie with religious delight and zeal at the comforting thought of this movie no longer existing.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Rick Rubins best work. The technicality of Rage Against the Machine, combined with the creativity of Soundgarden. If you liked Rage against the machine, but hated Zach de la Rochas average voice, this is for you. Tom Morello continues his streak of excellent-but-not-flashy guitar work, and Chris Cornells voice is sounding better than ever. This is some of the purest rock n roll ive ever heard. If you love heavy metal you'll like this. If you are a mellow music person you'll love this. There is no way not to love this cd. Suprising openings and amazing solos make this cd the best of 2002. I dont care who you are. Give this cd a try. You will love it
B0001UL7RY|1.0|When Eve offered Adam the apple how did she do it? Was she forceful or did she politley convince him to go down with her? I believe she puffed out her bare chest and demanded that Adam eat the apple, saying that she'd forever be without him if he didn't, that HER happiness depended on his forced decision. She got to him she postured her way into forcing him to consume the apple and accept life as a mere mortal. He could have conversed with beast and bird dammit! But no his arm was twisted by this forceful and fake woman, who couldn't find happiness within his happiness, no she he had to find happiness in his pain! Well I've heard Avril and she sounds the same, shining in other people's sadness (the men and women who bring down her &quot;brash&quot; orginallity) strutting left in right in punk rock clothing, brash sneers and callous eye rolls. Yet with that heart shaped mouth she sings of being betrayed and forced into being the ways she is. She excuses the constant abuse she gives to the people who love and want to be with her, as a sort of misconstrued misunderstanding of her fierce and independant spirit (which meanwhile is complete dependant on people trying to step on her). She sets up the front in her music and fashion that compels people to &quot;step up&quot; or in Adam's case consume the apple in the garden of good and evil. And as soon as common mortals who, by force and overt attraction, consume that apple they are dragged into a world in which they are villians and commoners forced to work for their survival in the world off of the sweat of thier backs. Virgil lead Dante to the depths of hell to find heaven, Avril lead us to the depths of hell and misery by forcing us to swallow her brashness and &quot;punk rock&quot; sensibility. Yet it's all wrapped in a pretty musical package (in the guise of independance) that makes other's salavate and makes most fear and regret.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|I refuse to buy these butchered versions of the best movies ever made.  Lucas' not-so-subtle scheme to milk more money from unsuspecting Star Wars fans is sickening.  <br /> <br />View the original versions on VHS.  Skip the special edition DVDs.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I thought it looked like a cool movie. As I watched it I thought it would all tie together in the end and make sense. But it didn't, it just left you hanging there. This movie is simply a bunch of random scenes thrown together. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I was so mad I destroyed my video tape afterwords. Steer clear.
B000286S8S|3.0|First off, why no songs from the &quot;3&quot; album? There were some great songs on there. 2nd, the intros and stuff to the new songs are good but the song quickly goes to crap. What is wrong with Van Halen? 3rd, there were way better songs from the Balence album they did not put on. Whoever made this compilation is a moron. Let me do it!
B00005NTJM|4.0|I remember back in the day when &quot;Aqualung&quot; was all the Jethro Tull I knew of, and yet the first song I remember hearing from them was &quot;Fat Man&quot;, and it was on a AM radio station. This was when rock and roll radio was sooooo much fun folks. Anyway back to this album. It's really not all that bad an album. The group is unfortunately stuck in the throse of 3 genres. Blues, Jazz, and Rock. However, there are only 2 songs that really stunk on here. They end up being the second track on both sides. Purely blues, and they sound so identical. &quot;Somedays The Sun Won't Shine For You&quot;, and &quot;It's Breaking Me Up&quot;, and both are harmonica infested, so if you hate harmonicas avoid at all cost. Now onto the juicy stuff. &quot;Dhrama For One&quot; is the albums highlight as it sways back and forth between Rock and Jazz rather splendidly, &quot;Move On Alone&quot; is a creative blues with claghorns which makes it sound like soul music. &quot;Serenade To A Cuckoo&quot; is one of the most beautiful jazz pieces ranked up there with Circus Maximus's &quot;Wind&quot;, and The Blues Project's &quot;Flute Thing&quot;. &quot;Beggar's Farm&quot; is a more dark sounding piece where Ian really shows off a good flourish of his flute playing, and let's not forget the song that may have inspired Black Sabbath to go to doom and gloom rock and roll &quot;Cat's Squirrel&quot; surrounded by a few stacks of Marshall Amps up to 11, and Mick Abraham's 9 string guitar. The bonus songs on here aren't too bad either except for the one Christmas song. It didn't do to well over here in the United States, but got some underground play I'm sure because after all the next album would put Tull on the map. I just happen to think &quot;This Was&quot; a rather very good album.
B00006CXSS|5.0|When I saw one of the chapters of this marvelous series on HBO I got impressed with the reallity, scenography, photography and costome design... the uniforms are very real !!! <br />It's a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes to watch great productions !!! <br />If I could I'll rate with 10 starts !!! <br />
B0000026UV|5.0|What a treat to listen these two great musicians having fun together.  The humor, the smooth guitar work, and little bit of Vince Gill in the back ground made this CD so special.  If want to listen to perfection, this is it!
0156027321|5.0|Pi is a young Indian boy who boards a ship to Canada, only to be shipwrecked on a boat with a huge Tiger.  Hope is gone until he learns that he can tame the tiger and hopefully survive long enough to reach land.  Without getting into much detail and spoiling the story, his journey is harrowing, scary, inventive, sometimes disgusting, but thoroughly captivating. <br /> <br />This would make it a good book, but the ending provides a fascinating twist that requires the reader to re-think all the events in the novel, making it great.  The preface (which I read last, as you should probably do as well), explains how this novel came about which is almost as interesting as the novel itself. <br /> <br />All in all, a great, thought provoking, inspiring novel.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This film was definatly the weakest of the trilogy, but it is still one of my personal fovorites. This film lacked the sophistication of The Fellowship of the Ring (which I believe is one of the most perfectly filmed motion pictures of all time) and was not nearly as entertaining and exciting as The Return of the King. First of all, nothing really happened in The Two Towers to advance the storyline. The movie can be summarized with two phrases...Gandalf returns, Saurumon is defeated...that's it. The ring does not get any closer to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili never catch up to the hobbits, Men have not untied against a common enemy, and the ending does not present the future challenges of the first film (i.e. the good guys win in the end). Secondly, the second half of the film is all about playing up the battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengard. In the book, the battle of Isengard and Helm's Deep do not seem that important. The battle of Isengard is barely even mentioned and the battle of Helm's Deep is half of a chapter (the battle of Minas Tirith is the real \\"great battle\\"). Finally, I must say that the ending to this film was absolutely terrible! If Peter Jackson would have ended the film were the book ends (Gandalf and Pippin riding off to Gondor), the conclusion of this film would have been much better. The film ends foreshadowing the victory over the forces of evil with the major victory of Helm's Deep. The film does not end with a major cliffhanger like a good second film should (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example); the film ends with a \\"key victory\\" rather than a setback. With all of this said, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is still a superb example of fine filmmaking. This picture is a must have for any fantasy lover.
B000002KEV|5.0|no, Im not talking bout the queen album, it is just like this album was played in heaven (or hell?), the well known anthems highway star, smoke on the water and strange kind of woman, plus the mammoth drum solo by Ian paice in &quot;the mule&quot; (check john bonham solo in moby dick - how the west was won, about 20 minutes of solid drumming), the funny interaction between Ian Gillan's voice and blackmore's guitar, sounds like two guitars really. All in all this is definitely one of rock n roll's milestones, a real icon in live recordings. Also, you can hear everything they play, since the jap fans are so quiet. <br /> Im missing the point, great classic rock n roll, power, some folk and jazz (yeah!), a killing voice, long jams, rocking seventies at its best. Real people playing real rock, as simple as that. Highly recommended.
B000002IU9|5.0|Manowar is one of those bands that has a lot of songwriting talent but are often dismissed from their inability to graduate from the \\"all hail us\\" kind of mentality that characterizes their lyrics.  This album marks somewhat of a departure from that songwriting mentality; I say somewhat because it is still present on a few songs.  However, overlooking that aspect, most of the material showcases some real lyrical talent, not to mention the amazing instrumental feats. This is not an album for those with short attention spans.  This is not to be listened to piecemeal, or a little here and there.  Lock the door, disconnect the phone, and put this on as loud as your neighbors will tolerate.  It will blow you away.  The first song, over 28 minutes in eight separate movements, is a masterful discourse of the story of ancient Troy in Greek myhology.  Follow the leaflet so you understand the separate movements and what they represent, and you will be hard pressed to find anything similar in modern music that can reach this plateau.  This is the kind of songwriting skill that the classical music masters put into their work, and it takes on a similar style and grandeur.  The subsequent tracks all showcase similar effort, although the theme varies.  The final track, Master of the Wind, is a soaring spiritual journey into the eternal strength of the human character that packs a more powerful punch than any of their earlier \\"we rule\\" mentality songs ever could.  This album is an oddity for Manowar in their career, always advertising on the record sleeve \\"no synths, no pedals, no wimps: just power, metal, and might\\" they make extensive use of them in this album, and somehow stand more powerful and mighty through their intelligent use of such devices to bring their music to another level.  Incidentally, the drummer for this album, listed only as \\"Rhino\\", is the most talented drummer I have ever heard, making Lars Ulrich and Tommy Lee look like kids banging on upturned kitchen potsin comparison.  Too bad he isn't on any of their other albums.  But then, none of their other albums even compare to this one.
038533348X|5.0|Having never read any Vonnegut before (but hearing good things about him from my sister), I was unsure what to expect. I still don't know that I could aptly describe what I read; however, suffice to say, I enjoyed it! Part sci-fi, part philosphy, part mystery, and part general confusion, Cat's Cradle kept me hooked from beginning to end!
B000000OQF|5.0|Arguably the best rock album of the 80's, and maybe one of the best ever, Appetite still remains relevent today and probably will forever.  Five dirtbags from LA got together somehow just long enough to capture and make history on one album.  Songs like Sweet Child O Mine and Paradise City accomplish in two songs what artists like Bon Jovi couldn't accomplish in an entire career.  It's So Easy is a sneering and arrogant kick in the nuts that all on its own makes so-called heavier bands almost look impotent in their ability to convey wrath.  You're Crazy is like three shots in the back of the head below the ear; just dumped out on the table with no doubt of it's implications.  The ablility of this band to convey the inspiration for the material, undoubtedly from first hand experience, is what sets this album apart from the rest of anything they ever did afterword.  Many have tried before and after to craft something to elict the same feelings that one gets upon hearing this album, all unsucessfully.  Girls lose their virginity to this album.  It's the quintessential expression of the demons of human nature, and just like this album, that will always be with us.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Unquestionably the front-runner for metal album of the year, IMO. This album tops even the much acclaimed Killswitch Engage release, &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; and even God Forbid's latest effort, &quot;Gone Forever.&quot; Unlike some other metalcore bands out there, Unearth manages to incorporate melody into their music without sacrificing a bit of brutality. This album will have you head-banging from start to finish with such amazing tracks as &quot;The Great Dividers,&quot; &quot;This Lying World,&quot; and &quot;Black Hearts Now Reign.&quot; Personally, I was not a fan of their earlier studio efforts, mainly due to the poor, poor, production quality. However, Adam Dutckiwiecz (if I spelled that right, bow down to me) does an impeccable job on this release.  <br />  <br /> Bottom line: If you are a fan of metal-buy this album. You will not regret it.
B000001C6M|5.0|Like so many great metal bands, Slayer is stigmatized and cheapened alongside today's music by their childlike demonic images on their album covers and their over-the-top super high speed riffs alongside Tom Araya's barking out words so fast you can't understand what he saying. Nonetheless, if you can get past the album cover of this one (for some people it's hard to bring this one to the register) you'll be justly rewarded by some of the best metal music ever committed to tape.  Slayer never actually plays too fast to be coherent, upon a closer listen they actually maintain a chorus and melody in all thier songs. So much so-called thrash metal are what I call \\"cookie monster bands\\" that consist of one endless gutteral growl along with some jackhammers in the background and a guitar \\"player\\" who really just turned up the distortion on his amp and plugged the input into the wall socket. All the songs on this album, however, showcase the roots of the talent that kept Slayer on the stage and in the studio for the past 20 years.  Show No Mercy shows no sign of becoming irrelevent anytime soon, with songs like Metal Storm/Face the Slayer, Crionics, and the Antichrist all on their own enough to send their architects to a permanent place in metal Valhalla.  If you find yourself wanting more, pick up Hell Awaits for a more expanded take on this style.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Well, I was not as pleased with this movie as with movies 1 & 2 respectfully.  I liked the inclusions of the newer characters and their importance.  However, I felt cheated from the lack of important characters like Cho Chang and not nearly enough of ones like Neville who is more than key to the later plots.  It was with a disjointed feeling that the scenes seemed to move and there wasn't enough made of the Marauder's Map and the reasoning for Sirius's animagus and the stag of Harry's Patronus.  It wasn't right to me how the ending left the fact that Sirius sent the Firebolt and that he'd signed Harry's permission slip for Hogsmeade the next year.  I was entertained by the way the movie matured into a more serious, darker tale as the characters are maturing and the books are showing them doing more mature things, while keeping their characters fairly true.  I missed the funnier, more loving portrayal of the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, though Michael Gambon did a great job making the role his own.  I hope, as I do with all these movies, that by seeing these films more people will be encouraged to pick up the books and get a better look into the world of Harry Potter!
B000002H2H|5.0|This has always been my favorite album by Metallica.  Some claim Master of Puppets to be the best, but I disagree. This is raw Metallica; louder, faster, and tighter than Kill 'Em All, but somehow looser and more ominous than Master.  I can't think of many songs in the whole genre of metal that can come even close to For Whom the Bell Tolls, or Fade to Black. I feel like I could do anything with those songs playing in the background. Despite the morbid overtones, this album wraps you up in its power and carries you on a hurricane ride for forty-seven and a half minutes. The instrumental Call of Ktulu, often overlooked, is quite simply some of the tightest work I have ever heard by any band in any genre.  Cliff's bass work that spasms at several points through the track is really a unique sound that has never been duplicated.  I could go on and on.  This is the first metal album that I ever heard, and the shock has never really worn off.
B00008EY65|3.0|well, at least the effects were good. Actually the story wasnt that bad. Ron Perlman is a great actor and if you want to see him in an amazing fantasy/gothic film check out City of Lost Children (WHICH IS AMAZING!) As for Hellboy, I thouht it could have been much better. I think it could also have had a darker tone. The cinematography was great and so were the effects but the story and the way it was told could have used a little more work. After listening to Del Toro's and Miliola's commentary on Hellboy, I discovered things about the story that there was no way I would have figured it out if the director himself hadnt explained it. The love story was pathetic I thought. Didnt need it in the film. Also, the commentary was very self centered, Del Toro and Miliola constantly refering to themselves in the 3rd person got really annoying, you would have that that Hellboy was this genious creation when in reality it's nothing more then a few other well known comic characters rolled into one. All in all rent it and have fun.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Don't get me wrong, Screaming for Vengeance, British Steel, and Hell Bent For Leather are great albums; many consider those to be the best this band has to offer.  I disagree; this album, somewhat of a dark horse (in the words of the band themselves) has it all.  Some of the most powerful metal songs I've ever heard are here: Some Heads are Gonna Roll is a prime example.  No, its not the fastest metal or even the best guitar work but this band is so tight on these tracks that it doesn't matter.  Halford's vocals are almost frighteningly powerful: Night Comes Down is a good example.  Many people don't realize how much more talent it takes to craft such a tight set that balances harmony and chourus and at the same time keeping everything moving smoothly.  A lot of bands can bang out tracks with a singer that just yells in key.  This is a masterpiece made by masters of music at the top of their game.  Don't miss out.
B00024BHTC|4.0|This is a great Nightwish cd. I like all the songs on it. You can't go wrong buying this if you like there other stuff. I can't stop listening to it. Tarja's voice absolutely mesmerizes me.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I think what sets this album apart from all the rest for me is not so much Joe's lead work (which is EXCELLENT don't get me wrong) but the rhythm section that provides that \\"tape loop\\" element that is designed to showcase the lead guitar work (listen to a few of his albums and you'll see what I mean). The rhythm guitar, bass, and drum sections are so tight that the lead comes across so much more dramatic than it actually is on its own.  It's sickeningly powerful concoction, and its hard not to just sit on the edge of your seat in anticipation of the wild lead stacattos that permeate the entire album.  Steady diets of this stuff will probably bore you, making you feel like you're playing Nintendo (around and around and around the race track).  But when you're in the mood to hear some incredible lead solos, always grab the Satriani, since their's nothing to beat it.
0385336810|4.0|I absolutely LOVED the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series. I had high expectations for this book, but was a bit disappointed. Character development was weak, especially with the &quot;love interest&quot; Jack - I also didn't feel there was any real chemistry between them. I did enjoy the book, as it was a fun, easy read, but I did not find it up to the standard of Kinsella's previous novels.
0752208446|4.0|This manual is considered to be the USCM &quot;Bible&quot; in Aliens fan circles.  Contains exhaustive information on weapons, equipment and organizational structure of the fictitious United States Colonial Marines.<br />Although there are wonderful photographs and illustrations, this manual could have contained much more visual information, including more &quot;cut-away&quot; blue-prints.<br />A must-have for any Aliens fans, as not all were fortunate enough to buy it some ten years ago...
0553277472|1.0|This book is dull and screamingly pretentious.  He promotes himself as having profound insights that qualify him to tell other people what's wrong with their lives and how they should change.  A self-help book like The One Minute Manager that wraps the advice up in a little story to try to make it look better.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time, but I got a bum steer on this one from The Whole Earth Catalog when I was an impressionable teenager.  Good title though, at least the part before the colon.
B000002LEU|5.0|How can one describe the first time one hears the voice of Ian Curtis?  It happened late one night watching mtv and anton corbijn's \\"atmosphere\\" rolled.  My teenage disillusion was rewarded with a worthy soundtrack.  There was something disaffected in the voice, a strange sort of longing that could never be fulfilled.  Something in the arcane rhythms and the off-kilter basslines demanded further investigation.  Sustance could be known as the \\"Top of the Pops\\" offerings of the darkest of bands.  Don't let the darkness fool you, there is a warmth somewhere at the heart.  Check out \\"Unknown Pleasures\\" and \\"Closer\\" too.
B000000I02|5.0|The music on this debut by Hatfield and the North is arranged in a large suite comprised of 15 parts, which includes lengthy instrumental sections interspersed with a vocalese by Robert Wyatt, excellent singing by the Northettes, and of course proper vocals by Richard Sinclair.  Stylistically, a great deal of the music on Hatfield and the North is superficially in keeping with the rhythmic and harmonic practices of jazz-rock, yet there are sections that are more in line with what most folks would consider to be progressive rock proper.  Specifically, there is intricate (and occasionally heavy) ensemble playing that emphasizes chord progressions used in European classical, which at times is reminiscent of Dave Stewarts work with Egg, passages that border on avante-rock, and spacey sections dominated by quiet, understated guitar parts, churchy organ, electric piano, and the superb, three-part vocal harmonies of the Northettes.  I think it is worth pointing out that the Northettes focus on creating soft soundscapes with their voices, much like a sustained mellotron pad, rather than the traditional backup vocal parts found in much of rock music.  In fact, they function as a very disciplined \\"mini choir\\".  The playing of all musicians is just excellent throughout, and the complexity and deadly seriousness of the suite contrasts sharply with section titles like \\"Going up to People and Tinkling\\" and \\"Shaving is Boring\\".  In addition to the 15-part suite, there are two separate pieces on this version of the CD entitled \\"Let's Eat (Real Soon)\\" and \\"Fitter Stoke has a Bath\\".  Although both of the additional pieces are enjoyable, the latter is much better than the pop of \\"Let's Eat\\".  This is absolutely excellent music and perhaps one of the best recordings created in the Canterbury style.  Recommended in addition to other excellent works of Canterbury rock including \\"Rock Bottom\\" (Robert Wyatt, 1974) and \\"In the Land of Grey and Pink\\" (Caravan, 1971).
B00004RJ74|4.0|That's the only real problem with this movie. Quentin Tarantino is a silly dweeb on camera, and his effort to portray a homicidal nutcase is, well, completely laughable. You have to stand up and cheer when George Clooney knocks him unconscious.<br /><br /> This isn't Quentin's strongest dialogue either--his trademarked approach of having characters talk about all manner of things to give the story &quot;realism&quot; seems forced. Also, the directing isn't what you'd expect from a Tarantino movie--shots are at times cliche, forced, and anything but subtle. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderfully realized scenes. But Tarantino didn't direct this, and it shows.<br /><br /> Now here's what's good. George Clooney, Harvey Keital and, yes, even Juliette Lewis turn in terrific, engaging performances. Now this isn't Shakespeare. It's Thelma and Louise meets Bonnie and Clyde meets 28 Days Later, with a humor, vampires, and a Holy Water supersoaker thrown in for good measure. Bear in mind, this is one violent, gory, and bloody film. If you've got a problem with that, go elsewhere.<br /><br /> And a review of From Dusk Till Dawn would not be complete without mentioning that Salma Hayek does a dance that is all the proof you need that she may well be the most beautiful, sexy woman in Hollywood. I never want to meet her, though, because I'm scared that when she opens her mouth she'll be dumb as a doorknob, and there's nothing sexy about that.
0385486804|4.0|This is an interesting and well-written book about a young man from a privileged background who felt compelled to live in the wild as much as possible.  I found McCandless an interesting character, but the parts of the book that I remember most are Krakauer's two chapters on his own wanderlust  This led him to his own adventure that could have taken his life in the same way that McCandless' took his.<br /><br />Krakauer and McCandless both went through more extreme versions of this wanderlust than most people, but many of us feel it more weakly.  His insights into this part of the human condition make the book.
B000002KDS|5.0|The Alice Cooper Band put out some of the best rock of the 70's and 'Killer' is one of the best albums of the decade. I won't bother going thru the individual songs, there are other reviews that do that very well, but suffice it to say Alice is in top form vocally, and the individual songs on 'Killer' are so strong and memorable, excellent guitar and keyboard work by Michael Bruce and Glen Buxton give each song a personality. But it's the backbone of the band, the bass by Dennis Dunaway and drums by Neal Smith that are worth the price of the disk. Dunaway's bass lines on songs like 'Halo of Flies' and 'Dead Babies' are so crisp and really drive the songs. This is Dunaway's best album outside of 'Love it to Death'. Neal Smith's drumming on the entire album is just amazing. I just don't see how Dunaway and Smith were not able to land a higher profile gig after the Alice Cooper band broke up?? 'Killer' is the perfect showcase for Smith and Dunaway's mastery of thier respective instruments. If you are interested in playing the bass or drums, then pick up 'Killer' to hear how to do it right.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Great realism. Those complaining about the shaky camera... I didn't notice it... I was busy focusing on the CONTENT in the screen. Some people are so used to Hollywood GLOSSING UP its movies that they can't appreciate realism. Those who complain about the camera shaking are as much with reality as someone who goes on a date with a beautiful woman and then COMPLAINS that she doesn't look like the women on the cover of MAXIM or FHM. Tsk, tsk... The movement of the camera ADDS to the realism... and draws the viewer into the action. Really, I was so engaged I didn't notice to camera was not straight. If it was nauseating I would say it was. <br />  <br /> And ALL THE LOCATIONS... VERY WELL DONE. This is WAY more realistic than James Bond who GOES EVERYWHERE and introduces himself as &quot;Bond... James Bond&quot;.  <br />  <br /> LOVED THE SUBTITLES AND THE AUTHENTIC LANGUAGES... Again... REALISM!!! <br />  <br /> NO CARTOONY GADGETS... JUST PURE SKILL, INTELLIGENCE AND SPEED.  <br />  <br /> The movie proceeds at good speed and is genuinely thrilling. Plus it's not all action... you have to use your brain to figure out what's going on and tie things together. But the story is told well and everything gels nicely and you aren't lost during the movie.  <br />  <br /> The only thing I didn't appreciate was the LONG CAR-CHASE. This went overboard I think... I don't think that vehicle could have been running with all those hits. All the other scenes are just the right duration. <br />  <br /> I still give the movie top marks for plot, realism (similar to Traffic, Man on Fire [kinda]), acting, music and everything else.  <br />  <br /> One of the best of the year! <br />  <br />
B00005V9HH|4.0|I will be brief about Bryan Singer's THE USUAL SUSPECTS. It is often classified as a modern film noir, but though it isn't the equal of great modern film noirs as CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, on its own terms it is a well-made, entertainingly twisty little mystery. It has good performances all around (Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for basically bringing a welcome wit and energy to a generic narrator role---well, at least it seems generic for most of the movie), and Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar-winning screenplay offers deliciously hardboiled dialogue and, especially, some genuinely startling plot twists---with the final twist being the most shocking of all. Personally, I was able to accept that controversial final twist a bit more easily than many others did---it certainly made for great theater, if you know what I mean. Now, whether it truly stands up upon repeated viewings is a more difficult question. All in all, a very good, not great, thriller, but suspenseful and entertaining enough to be worth a viewing or two---and I'm sure most people who watch it once will feel compelled to watch it again. Recommended.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Great... Just when I've broken down and bought the Divimax version, the release of the Ultimate Edition of Dawn of the Dead is announced. I can't wait to get my hands on it, then call in sick at work for a few days to enjoy all of the features on the discs! <br />  <br /> Just an idea... can't these companies arrange a rebate of some kind, like Disney did for those who bought the VHS copy of &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; and chose to upgrade to DVD, for those of us who bought prior DVD editions of &quot;Dawn of the Dead?&quot; Just a thought...
B000002VCE|4.0|Good Disc from a great band.  The guitar playing by Jones and Thomasson is awesome.  Arguably the best guitar assault in all of Southern Rock.  No Henry Paul on the album is a letdown.  Overall a good live album to sit out by the pool and listen to with a cold one in your hand!!!
B00005M91K|5.0|Still my favorite film of all time.<br /><br />A must-see for all humans.<br /><br />Love is the Law &#60;3
B0000028SR|4.0|This is not Springsteen's best album, but like several previous reviewers I think it is one of his most underrated. Some Springsteen purists resented the fact that he used L.A. studio musicians rather than the E Street Band to make this album. The resulting sound is slightly more polished and commercial than his earlier albums, but doesn't undermine the essential raw emotion and energy of Springsteen's music. <br /> <br />Human Touch is a collection of mainly hard-rocking songs about the difficulty of life and love, and fears of inadequacy in the face of those difficulties. There are several songs of great depth here, including \\"I Wish I Were Blind\\" (one of Springsteen's best ever, in my opinion), \\"Human Touch\\", \\"Cross My Heart\\", \\"With Every Wish\\", and \\"Man's Job.\\" I also like the blue-eyed soul funkiness (unusual for Springsteen) of \\"Soul Driver.\\" True, there are also a few stinkers among the songs, but overall I think this is a good album and deserving of more credit than it has gotten. <br />
B00005JN2F|4.0|A great action movie (not art film)which was almost ruined with the &quot;artsy&quot; hand-held camera. With all of the innovative mechanics for the camera available today, why employ an out of date technique - the jerky, hand-held camera? Matt Damon's excellenbt action sequences could not be fully appreciated and the car chase sequences were hard to follow. It did add to the tension - I wanted to assassinate the director. The bad guy was too obvious. Matt Damon was perfect in his role and the rest of the strong supporting cast were great, especially Joan Allen. I would have given this movie a 5 star rating if not for the irritating camera work.
B00005JN2F|1.0|Loved the first movie - all that made it great IS NOT HERE!  IWAITED TWO YEARS FOR THIS SEQUEL!!!!! I WANT TO SCREAM!<br /><br />My GOD how did Universal let this movie out?!?!?! Surely there were executives watching the 'daily's' back from shooting and could see this director COULD NOT HOLD A CAMERA STRAIGHT! I mean - my four year old could have made a better movie if he were operating the camera...  Sure - a little shaky cam is okay - but not 2 CONTINUOUS HOURS! I literally had to look away in sections...<br /><br />There were fight scenes in the first movie perfectly choreographed. Not only could you not see what was happening - but Matt Damon could have had his double do 90% of the scene and you would not know because the camera work was beyond pitifull!<br /><br />Let's not even go into the concept of a decent script and decent acting. I can't lay blame on the actors - (well - except the CIA Deputy Director and Director - they were just plain bad...) Because these were the same actors for the most part and 'Bourne Identity' was a great movie - so again - I have to blame it on the Director and the Studio.<br /><br />I tried to fine something decent on the movie - John Powell's score was fairly good and mixed well enough that you could hear it.<br /><br />But save your self the nausea and the loss of 2 hours of your life that you can not get back!

B0002IQJUK|5.0|Chariot, Gavin's first record has been playing non-stop in my CD player since I got it - His voice gives me chills, his piano playing is amazing, his lyrics are real and relateable, you'll have these songs in your head and want to sing them all day....but wait...there's more!  The stripped double CD version comes with a 2nd CD - Granted, it's the same songs as the 1st, but they're more acoustic, more real, and are different enough to love them all the same!  They really show off his voice...and again...more chills!!!  This DOUBLE CD is DEFINATELY worth the money!!!
B000000P17|3.0|I guess this is different in scope because the entire album <br />is cover versions of tracks the band likes. I guess it gives <br />you a more introspective look at the band. The negative side <br />to this album is there is no G'n'R original material, but the <br />positive side is that G'n'R introduces artists that they like, <br />or artists that might have been long forgotten. Anyways, back <br />to the reviews. As others have mentioned, the selection of a <br />1950s oldie seems out of place, that being the first track <br />listed. As you listen to the album, it appears G'n'R really <br />are fond of punk and rock, covering the likes of The Sex <br />Pistols, Iggy Pop, Nazareth and The New York Dolls, which <br />makes the choice of The Skyliners' Since I Don't Have You <br />all the more puzzling. <br /> It is really difficult for me to evaluate how well they <br />pulled off the cover versions, especially since I have <br />only heard the Skyliners and Nazareth original songs. <br />My advice is to get the other G'n'R albums first before <br />buying this one. They do a reasonable job on Hair of The <br />Dog and Since I Don't Have You, but I prefer the original <br />versions to the G'n'R covers, as I do for most songs. As <br />the title suggests, it is probably nothing more than a <br />collection of favorite songs band members liked when they <br />were growing up. <br />Here's the Track Listing: <br /> 1. Since I Don't Have You 4:18 The Skyliners - 1958 <br /> 2. New Rose 2:38 The Damned - 1977 <br /> 3. Down On The Farm 3:23 The UK Subs - 1980 <br /> 4. Human Being 4:32 The New York Dolls - 1974 <br /> 5. Raw Power 3:10 Iggy Pop and The Stooges - 1973 <br /> 6. Ain't It Fun 4:59 The Dead Boys - 1978 <br /> 7. Buick Makane (Big Dumb Sex) 2:37 T.Rex - 1973 <br /> 8. Hair Of The Dog 3:57 Nazareth - 1975 <br /> 9. Attitude 1:29 The Misfits - 1980 <br />10. Black Leather 3:45 Steve Jones/The Sex Pistols - <br />    1980 <br />11. You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory 3:34 Johnny Thunders <br />    - 1978 <br />12.

B00005JN2X|5.0|Los Angeles, the City of Angels. Under a blank, blue sky, millions of people go to sleep, go to work, endure the daily grind. The monotonous cycle, over and over again. With nightfall, the street lights glow a shade of murky yellow; the coyotes come to prowl; and the city becomes beacon-like underworld in the midst of the darkness.<br /><br />And it started like any other night...<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is a 12-year veteran cabbie making the rounds to achieve a dream that, by the day, becomes more and more just that. One fateful evening, a grey-haired fare by the name of Vincent hires his services and his life will never be the same...<br /><br />Vincent is an assassin, sent to kill five key players in a major drug case. He meant to complete his assignment without Max ever knowing the better, but situations are compromised, fate intervenes. Now, Max is caught up in the uncomfortable position of driving this killer from hit to hit, always knowing that, at any time, he himself could be killed.<br /><br />Filmed on location in LA, words simply fail to describe the excellence of this film. Every single bit that comprises this masterpiece was crafted so well: the direction, the performances, the script.<br /><br />Directed by Michael Mann, he uses a rather grainy filter for the movie, accentuating the griminess that is LA at night. The angles used are not at all cinematic in the typical sense; they're jolty at times, never contrived; natural. The lighting is interesting as most of the scenes, thought lit, provide an overwhelming sense of darkness, mirroring the overbearingly shady proceedings going on amongst the ignorant bliss of common folk.<br /><br />The performances, most of them anyways, are not \\"electrifying\\" nor all those other fluff/buzz words; they are what they are meant to be: BELIEVABLE. Whether it's Max falling for one of his fares or Vincent just losing his intel, their emotions, actions, reactions all flow so smoothly; nothing is contrived. Tom Cruise as the brutally effective assassin Vincent is nothing less than inspired casting; after being bombarded with goody-goody roles for the extent of his career, he is finally revealing his dark side and he delivers. Every line, from the most scathing threat to sickly sweet falsified niceties, is spoken with complete disregard of the camera's existence. After this convincing performance, I am certain some will begin to question his Hollywood Nice Guy reputation.<br /><br />But even more impressive yet is Jamie Foxx's turn as the befuddled cab driver Max. Grim at times, sometimes poignant, and with a touch of wry humor, his performance is simply unforgettable. He is able to show his character worry, contemplate, and mature so well.<br /><br />Lastly, there is the incredible script. The dialogue never gets too movie-ish; there are no three-minute soliloquies or indecipherable metaphysical debates. These are spoken words by any person, any average citizen. The cab exchanges between Max and Vincent, besides showcasing the fantastic chemistry between Cruise and Foxx, become scenes of psychological warfare between the two. Max tries to prod into the inner workings of an essentially empty, driveless man while Vincent attemps to reveal the harmful nature of one man's complacency. Never does the dialogue become inaccessible or needlessly complex, always clear and to the point.<br /><br />Many films are great. But rarely are they ever so close to perfection that you wonder when such a film can ever be outdone. Then again, Collateral is a rare movie in and of itself, the sum of all equally great parts, an exhilarating trip through Los Angeles, that it deserves to be one of those films.brutally effective assassin Vincent is nothing less than inspired casting; after being bombarded with goody-goody roles for the extent of his career, he is finally revealing his dark side and he delivers.

6305678715|3.0|Barring some gorgeous shots of San Francisco and a couple of stray good moments with Sean Connery, there really is very little in this movie that makes too much sense.<br /><br />The washed-up theme of two partners forced to work together despite hating each other's guts is colored a little by tossing in another character to convolute affairs -- one partner's daughter. Who adds precious little to the theme at the end of it all. In fact, we don't even know what really happens to her after that baseless (no pun intended) bedroom sequence.<br /><br />And if you mistakenly lead yourself to believe that this was simply an overdrawn soap, there's a \\"gem\\" of a secret plot that unravels just in time before the credits roll, leaving you with a simple question -- why was it necessary to involve bottled water at any moment in the execution of the criminal scheme?<br /><br />An added bonus of skipping this utterly skippable movie may be that you will not have to ask yourself that question.
B000059Z8J|3.0|The historical importance of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" is indisputable, as a matter of fact, the importance of the character is indisputable. In the 1930s Superman was one of the earliest superheroes that came to life. In the late 1970s \\"Superman: The Movie\\" was the first comic-based movie, and ever since those historical landmarks, thousands of superheroes have come to life in the comics, and dozens of comic-based movies have hit the screen.       Well, many years later, Superman (the comic) has lost a lot of its appeal with younger generations, and Superman (the movie) has dated in many areas. The performances are very solid, to be honest, only \\"Batman (1989)\\" can compete with \\"Superman: The Movie\\" in that area. But the visual effects every year look more and more dated. Obviously, a movie is much more than special effects, the most important thing in a movie is the story.      Well, this movie tells the story of a superhero who can keep secret his identity with thick eyeglasses and changing his hairstyle, of a flying Alien that can reverse the time and events in the Earth by changing the rotation of the Planet. As you can see, the plot is very nave, but it's also very entertaining.      The romantic idea of an almost invincible superhero might not be appealing for today's kids, because today's movies present more complex characters, like the X-Men, Batman or Spider-Man, characters that have a dark side (Batman) or represent issues like the social segregation (X-Men), or have an inner struggle between having a normal life or save people that are not thankful (Spider-Man). But to people who are 30+ years old \\"Superman: The Movie\\" is pure fun. By The way, \\"Superman II\\" is better than this movie because it actually present a vulnerable hero, he is a more complex character in the second movie, his relationship with Lois is deeper, and he faces real danger.
6305558167|4.0|Few movies have impressed me visually and symbolically as 'Excalibur' has. Though it takes place in the Middle Ages, it is still very much relevant to today's time.  <br />  <br /> It tells the story of the life of the greatest king who never lived, King Arthur. Though, as you would expect, there are the epic battle sequences, the jousting matches, the feasts at the famous Round Table, etc., there are so many underlying themes that this story tells.  <br />  <br /> Guenevere and Lancelot's affair tells of mankind's general inability to resist that which tempts us. <br />  <br /> Merlin's Dragon, which encompasses all of the very earth, &quot;It's scales are in the bark of the trees, it's breath is in the wind.&quot; This is likened to the Medieval conception of God - that he is all encompassing.  <br />  <br /> Though I could go on for much loner, suffice it to say that the movie, though dated today, met extraordinary visual and symbolic depths. The result - 'Excalibur.' <br />  <br /> I strongly recommend this film to anyone interested in the tale of King Arthur, or even anyone just looking for a good movie. The only negative about this movie is that it is a bit confusing and slow in the beginning. But, as I told my brothers, once you get into it it is very hard to stop watching,
630179513X|3.0|***  stars for &quot;Back To The Future, Part III&quot;. Well, this movie isn't exactly a western, but it's a nice twist in the direction of the series, and a good conclusion to this excellent saga. This time, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and our favorite mad scientist Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are stuck in the Old West, and that premise gives a lot of opportunities to play with opposite genres, Western and Sci-Fi. <br />  <br /> &quot;Back To The Future, Part III&quot; also presents references to classic westerns, specially John Huston's famous camera angles that show desert landscapes, and spaghetti westerns, like Sergio Leone's &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot; and &quot;The Man With No Name&quot; trilogy (or &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy, if you prefer). One funny example of a reference to classic westerns happens when someone asks Marty his name, and he always answers &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;. <br />  <br /> I can't imagine a different cast in these movies: Michael J. Fox superbly plays the hero of the trilogy, Christopher Lloyd does what he does better: he plays a lunatic, Thomas F. Wilson mastered the role of Tannen (Biff, Griff and Mad Dog Tannen). In few words, every actor seems perfect for every role. <br />  <br /> &quot;Back To The Future, Part III&quot; is a very amusing movie, it has comedy, action and romance, and the movie closes one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made.
1592400876|1.0|Zero tolerance? Indeed! Haggling and argufying minor point after minor point displays zero tolerance? This approach is no better than the pre burger-chain disputes over table manners. <br />The Athenian Greeks used no punctuation. Nor did they distinguish lower and upper case.

The rest will follow naturally.
B00008DDXL|4.0|Harry Potter returns to Hogwart's for his second year in Magical-Scholastic training. And now he is pretty well settled to begin afresh on a new adventure. He is sprung from his room {he actually is granted a room, probably at the behest of Magical intervention}, away from the muggles who despirately try to keep him as their virtual slave; released by the Weasley Brothers in a flying car to which they affix a chain to Harry's barred window and make away back to school, his true home in this case; with Privet Drive being more like a tower of imprisonment holding many bad memories.<br /><br /> They run into The Whomping Willow, a burly tree who beats the car about unmercifully, instead of weeping. When they finally meet the ground, the car, a living being in itself, becomes understandably annoyed and races off.<br /><br /> Arachnophobes beware! Arachnophiles delight! Another remarkable moment occurred when their adventures lead them into the enchanted forest, followng clues by a vision, deep into a cave to speak with a huge spider creature, a wise monster indeed, who would not allow them to leave without providing sustainance for his young:<br /><br /> &quot;I cannot deny them fresh meat which comes so willingly into our midst. Farewell, friend of Hagrid...&quot;<br /><br /> And the chase is on. They unbelievably make it out into the forest where they are rescued by the car, squashing a few spiders along the way, until they finally reach the safety of the castle. So the mystery monster has yet to be divulged, until the very end, Voldemort makes an appearence as his preferred manifestation of youth, aspiration, and vigor - along with an impressive serpantime basilisk at this bidding, which he orders to kill Potter, but is eventually thwarted by Dumbledore's phoenix who plucks out his eyes.<br /><br /> Draco Malfoy's father plays a role in the film, along wth Gilderoy Lockheart, a popinjay-poseur opportunist par excellance, which does speak to the faux &quot;magician&quot; type who frequently takes credit for others' accomplishments, as well as natural occurrences; jumping in at the last moment pretending it to be their own - he may fool the muggles, but a true Magician can spot this type outright. He has the audacity to engage Snape in a wand-sparring competition, of which his knowledge and experience is virtually null, and is forthwish humiliated by the Dark Potions instructor. His rottenness reveals itself in a subsequent in which, behind the fanciful facade of a rather weakan exterior in aesthetic and shallow personality, deems to take credit for the exploits of Harry's innovation, but through circumstance loses his memory by a well-deserved blow to the head by Ron Weasley.<br /><br /> Overall, it is analyzed that the film should be seen three or more times in order to appreciate all of the quick scenes which run by far too fast, as there is so much to the books, that each one could quite easily fit into two films at a time, but for expedience, was compressed into a little more than two hours. Viewing this film in the theatre is amusing for an entertaining &quot;night out&quot;, but I believe it would be far more appreciated in one's own Lair. Still, to experience this series to the fullest, the highest resommendation is to read the books themselves, and this the films will be far more vibrant.<br /><br /> Another element that was noted was in the instance when introduced to &quot;Dobby&quot; the house elf, who appeared just as I imagined him, who is a masochistic characterpracticing self-flegellation for the smallest infraction in slave conduct who, through all of his efforts, attempts to prevent Potter from attending another year at Hogwarts, for the apprent reason that he fears for his safety. although it is later divulged that he has another Master, who himself does not wish Potter to return.<br /><br /> In one scene involving the house elf, Potter frees him from his cruel master's rule by actually bestowing him an articleof clothing, thereby liberating him from slavery, which did receive a few han dclaps of approval from the audience, particularly from a negro woman who obviously conected this as a metaphor for ancestor oppression... but the question remains, &quot;what does Dobby do now?&quot; For it is known, that the slave-type encompasses most of humanity, who are in the majority followers, necessitating a leader, a ruler, a master, whether it be a so-called &quot;God&quot;, messiah, television, trends, etc. Although in this day and age, they still want to be told what to do, but without the use of the word &quot;slavery&quot; - so instead, PC terminology has been invented such as &quot;team player&quot;, &quot;church group&quot;, &quot;congregation&quot;, etc., that it may be more palatable - yet drones they remain, no matter which connotation is used.<br /><br /> Overall, if one has been well entertained by the premiere film &quot;Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, then &quot;The Chambre of Secrets&quot; is well worth the watching.bestowing him an article of clothing, thereby liberating him from slavery, which did receive a few han dclaps of approval from the audience, particularly from a negro woman who obviously conected this as a metaphor for ancestor oppression... but the question remains, &quot;what does Dobby do now?&quot; For it is known, that the slave-type encompasses most of humanity, who are in the majority followers, necessitating a leader, a ruler, a master, whether it be a so-called &quot;God&quot;, messiah, television, trends, etc. Although in this day and age, they still want to be told what to do, but without the use of the word &quot;slavery&quot; - so instead, PC terminology has been invented such as &quot;team player&quot;, &quot;church group&quot;, &quot;congregation&quot;, etc., that it may be more palatable - yet drones they remain, no matter which connotation is used.  <br />  <br /> Overall, if one has been well entertained by the premiere film &quot;Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, then &quot;The Chambre of Secrets&quot; is well worth the watching.
B00004Z459|5.0|Let me start out by saying I own cds of all genres: cookie cutter pop, chirstian rock/pop, pop country, classical, rock, and soft rock. All except rap. I hate rap; in fact, I DETEST rap. I find I don't like rock that much either. And yet Hybrid Theory gets more time in my cd player than any other cd. Why? Because many of these critics are right: this isnt pure rap/rock. And that's the way I like it; simply, I like Linkin Park for what they are. You can't categorize Linkin Park under one genre and expect thier music to fit in seamlessly.    So with that said, what amuses me to no end about this cd is that there is a lot of screaming, enough that it verges on being vulgar, yet there is no swearing (shut up would literally be the extent of it). They're rageful, but WHAT they have to say and HOW they have to say it is enough to express themselves; they don't need the cheap effect of cuss words to make their point. My hats off to LP for managing that. (In reality, I don't care whether a band swears or not, as long as they sounds earnest.) But this lyrical cleanliness just works out with Linkin Park, which is admirable, considering the fact that they're music is most associated with \\"rap/rock\\", two genres riddled with the f-word.    But lyrical cleanliness aside, the greatest part of HT is the meat of the cd, as it should be; in other words, the music. They're lyrics are dead-on; a lot of teenagers will relate to them. The songs can be about anything the listener wants them to be about--the effects of conforming with the rest of society, expectations from friends and family, a lose-lose relationship, and peer pressure. It all works.     And those lyrics are delivered in the form of disgustingly addictive choruses, raps and screams by two artists who know what they are doing. Chester can sing his heart out. Even his screaming, while angry, is harmonized. And you can actually understand Mike's raps, which never, ever stoop to the \\"bling-bling kind of rhymes with f--ing\\" trend rampant in today's hip-hop world. Not only can you understand them, but his smooth raps complement Chester's angry, tortured vocals flawlessly.      With that in mind, I won't hesitate to give Hybrid Theory a five out of five.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Afterglow is a great cd, although I think my favorite is still Surfacing.  Perhaps because it is a little more of a commercial sounding album.  However, Afterglow seems to return to the original Sarah sound that I fell in love with.  Good for stress reduction in traffic after work!
B00009Y2K9|5.0|Purely Magical!  This is one of those rarities that make you re-gain your lost and forgotten powers. When you listen to these collaborations, you embarke on a journey with some of the world's most talented artists and improvisers; you are taken through some of the most beautiful labyrinths in Cuba, Spain, Argentina, Brazil,America...etc. Boundaries are non-existent, and suddenly you will realize again that the Language of L'amour is your only passport to this world.

B0001WTUH6|4.0|I watched the extended version last night, never having seen the original movie.  I enjoyed it.  I though that the characters were interesting, the acting was good, and the story compelling.  The feel and visuals were excellent and consistant through the film. <br /> <br />What I did not like was the way it was all put together.  Many of the scenes were filmed from odd angles, and the editing tended to be crude, wasting a lot of time between scenes, where a shorter edit, while not removing anything, would move the picture along a little faster. <br /> <br />In viewing the attached specials, it becomes clear why this is so.  the creators have a wonderful vision and know what they want to show us, but this is a young crew.  Even their experienced cinematographer has never worked on a movie of this type.  The result is that their vision is hampered by a lack of experience.  Even so, it is a good movie that I will watch again. <br /> <br />I am looking forward very much to the sequel next year.  Hopefully they can maintain their quality of vision and bring greater experience to the screen.
B000286S8S|5.0|I just got into Van Halen recently and i bought this &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot; greatest hits package and i am very impressed with all of the songs even the 3 new ones are good but the rest is utterly Amazing &quot;Aint Talkin Bout Love&quot; is probually my favorite right now but there are other classics such as &quot;Runnin With The Devil&quot; and &quot;Jump&quot; &quot;Unchained&quot; &quot;Dreams&quot; its all here if you have never heard of this band then go out and instead of buying some Nu-Metal go buy some Van Halen
B00005JN2X|5.0|Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are outstanding! Without a doubt Tom Cruise will be nominated and most likely win the best actor Oscar (Denzel got one for a much more basic bad-guy role) for his role as the cool and dangerous hitman named Vincent. Foxx should at least get nominated for a supporting role, because he proves to everyone that he can hold his own with Cruise. Without these two casting choices the movie wouldn't be half as good. The plot is a little thin and predictable at times, but the dialogue is written very well and the direction is tight. The action scenes (mainly Tom kicking butt) aren't gory, but they are brutal and fast much as they would be in a real fight with a trained killer delivering the blows. The realism of the film adds much more depth and some of the time I completely forgot I was watching a hollywood made movie. Kudos to all involved and thanks Micheal Mann for reviving the thriller/suspense genre in such a stylish way.
B00003CXCT|1.0|For everyone who is upset at only the Revised editions being available on DVD, well, I agree with you. With the capacity of the DVD disc, there is no reason why both the revised and &quot;classic&quot; versions of the movies couldn't be placed on all three discs. This is what I hoped would be done, but alas, George wouldn't get twice the amount of money that way. The latest piece of information I heard, and I hope this is wrong, is that the ghost images of Obi Wan and Anakin will be replaced with Ewan McGregor and Haydn Christensen in the DVDs.
B00009M97Z|3.0|I bought this CD based on the reviews I've read.  I have to say I'm slightly dissappointed.  Don't get me wrong, this CD is worth a listen.  Is it great or something I'd rave about?  No.  Carla Bruni's voice is calming and capable, but it lacks depth and character.  It's missing a certain flavour that would make her music more interesting.  When music is as pared down as this, you need a voice that carries more emotion or depth or at least evoke a certain mood.  Take Francoiz Breut or Coralie Clement or even Vanessa Paradis for example, their voices are not powerhouses but they add a bit of flavour to the songs they sing.  Carla's guitar playing is more impressive.  All that said, I'd recommend this CD as a worthy listen, very suitable for a quiet, relaxing day.  It is a CD that's pretty good for a model.
B00003CXXM|5.0|If you didn't know it already this one was the top selling video rental of 2003. Now that clearly states it targeted for a diverse audience and that it hardly dissapoints anyone.  <br /> <br />The best part about this movie was that it always keeps you thinking...never a dull moment. Matt Damon was always a great actor but with this he's got a break as a star.  <br /> <br />A car chase, good stunts (including the one at the embassy), strong story line, great acting and good direction summarize the movie. A true thriller. One other area that deserves a mention is the music (especially at the end)...very aptly composed. My only complaint is that Clive Owen and Julia Stiles were not used to their full potential. Nevertheless they performed their bits extremely well. <br /> <br />Worth watching atleast once. <br />
B0000035E7|5.0|Okay, I started out with Nirvana's Nevermind Album, so I never really got why people kept saying that Nirvana was one of the loudest sounds in rock music. I mean, most of the songs on Nevermind were pretty, well, plain rock. Nothing loud or special, although the songs themselves were absolutely amazing, and Kurt has got have one of the best voiced I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Upon trying Bleach, however, I was immediately blown away. I mean, it almost sounds METAL. I must say that Nirvana's style had evolved during their short time under the spotlight. You don't hear any tracks similar to Something in the Way or Come As You Are. It's not a good thing, but it's not all that bad, either. It's a good album if you want something hard and heavy. <br /> <br />I wouldn't say it's their best, that spot being reserved for either Nevermind or Unplugged in New York (I just like hearing the interraction between the band and the audience, that's all...) but it is DEFINITELY Nirvana, and is quite an enjoyable album.

B0000TB01Y|4.0|Wicked is the new Broadway smash hit. Wicked is the number one show on Broadway right now, and everyone is going crazy for it. <br />  <br /> The Original Cast recording for Wicked is quite good. The two leading ladies are Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Though, Chenoweth is not part of the cast anymore, she really left her mark on the show, and won't be forgotten. Both ladies have extraordinary voices. This Cast Recording is worth it alone just for Idina and Kristin. <br />  <br /> The album starts with the beautiful &quot;No One Mourns the Wicked&quot;, with Kristin as the main solo singer in the song. Kristin's voice is absolutely beautiful in the song, she shows off her opera skills, and she sounds wonderful. A great song.  <br /> Idina Menzel makes her entrance with &quot;The Wizard And I&quot;, another beautiful song where Elphaba expresses her hopes to meet the Wizard. Next Elphaba and Galinda meet, and makes their first duet &quot;What Is This Feeling&quot;, another great, fun song. Next is &quot;Something Bad&quot; performed by Doctor Dillamond and Elphaba, the song is pretty much useless, and uneeded in the score. Next is another great song &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot;, followed by Glinda's hilarious solo song &quot;Popular'. Elphaba's &quot;Im not that Girl&quot; follows, which is just an okay song. Next Elphie and Glinda are enjoying their &quot;One Short Day&quot;, in the Emerald City, a wonderful song. Nex they meet the Wizard, in &quot;A Sentimental Man&quot;, this song should've been reworked, it's too short. Next is one of the best songs from the score, the amazing, the beautiful, the acclaimed &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;. <br />  <br /> The Second Act has some extremely high points also. &quot;Thank Goodness&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful&quot;, are wonderful songs. &quot;As Long as You're Mine&quot; is a beautiful love ballad. &quot;No Good Deed&quot;, is Elphaba's powerhouse rock number. And &quot;For Good&quot; is Glinda and Elphaba's extremely touching and beautiful duet. <br />  <br /> So clearly, &quot;Wicked&quot; shouldn't be missed, its a great score. The Cast Recording has it's high and low points, but is entertaining regardless.
B00007KWHN|5.0|For a lot of fans, Yes truly began with 1971's &quot;The Yes Album.&quot; While this is totally inaccurate (don't forget &quot;Yes&quot; & &quot;Time And A Word&quot; you guys), the band DID make it's first real splash in the world with this prog-rock beauty. With new guitarist Steve Howe (replacing Peter Banks), the band were in a real make-it-or-break-it situation. Their first pair of albums, terrific as they are, still didn't sell very well. So, for their third album, Jon Anderson & the boys had to come up with a commercial winner this time around, or they would've been dropped from their label. Thankfully, they came up with a beautiful, classic rock album that still sounds just as fresh today as it did 30 years ago, and the record buyers responded in droves. With &quot;The Yes Album,&quot; Yes were finally on their way.Anchored by Chris Squire's amazing basslines, Yes are in peak performance here. &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; kicks it all off with a bang (and a riff that, according to drummer Bill Bruford, the band lifted from the TV show &quot;Bonanza&quot;!). After the galloping wonder of this song, Steve Howe comes in with his upbeat acoustic showcase, &quot;Clap,&quot; which has since become Steve's signature piece. &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; is another winner, with one of the most rousing rock instrumental finales ever recorded. &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; is a lovely sing-along piece, and yet another Yes signature. Next up is &quot;A Venture,&quot; easily the least-mentioned song on this album, and yet I don't know why, 'cause it's a truly great tune---featuring Tony Kaye's thumping piano, Jon Anderson's amazing vocal delivery and some fine drumming from Bill Bruford, &quot;A Venture&quot; is a true buried treasure. Finally there's &quot;Perpetual Change,&quot; an amazing album closer that sees the band floating off into the aural heavens in great style.There's not a bad track anywhere, and the band's musical chemistry, captured in all it'sglory by producer Eddie Offord, is supreme.   &quot;The Yes Album&quot; paved the way for the later Yes classics &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close To The Edge,&quot; and is arguably the band's finest work. Yes, poised for the big time in 1971, had creativity coming out of their ears at this point in time, and &quot;The Yes Album&quot; wonderfully captures this great moment in the band's history for all to hear. Buy, listen, and enjoy Yes at their very best.

B00005JLYW|4.0|So the plotline is lacking in some areas, this is still a fun movie to watch. It sure made me forget about my boring life for a while. Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu kick booty once again as Charlie's Angels. This time Bernie Mac plays Bosley and there is a whole new bad guy (or gal in this case) to battle. There is quite a bit of comedy, I laughed at the dirt bike race when Lucy Liu was like 'no, uh-uh' to that one guy who was bugging her. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and the special effects are over the top, especially the dirt bike scenes! Rent this movie and see how many of the cameos you can pick out (PS where are the Olsen twins in the cameo-graphy?). I personally could have done without the gratuitous car wash scene over the closing credits. All in all it's a still a good time, just watch it with nacho chips, cuz it oozes cheese.
B000000OQF|5.0|During an age where the Rock world was dominated by ridiculous makeup-wearing, party-hardy hair bands and prissy shredding, along came Guns 'N Roses and their album 'Appetite For Destruction'. The gritty and down-and-dirty Rock 'N Roll sound they brought with them was something not heard since the days of the Stones. There isn't one filler to be found, and every song had the potential to become a hit single. Every track on here is a winner. From the snarling guitars of 'Welcome to the Jungle' to the punk bass-influenced 'It's So Easy', you can't doubt such genius. \\"Think About You\\" and \\"Sweet Child\\" reveal the band's heartfelt side, two good love songs. 'Nightrain' is a great blues rocker while the mean riffs of 'Out to Get Me' scream paranoia and speed metal wreaks havoc in 'You're Crazy'. \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" is as lyrically impressive as it is musically. The rest of the album is as equally good.<br /><br />Frontman Axl Rose isn't a flawless singer, but he gets the job done. Guitar players Slash and Izzy are definitely the best axe attack duo since Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Slash is a great lead guitarist, with his trailblazing work in the outro of 'Paradise City', the wah-wah pedal inducing 'Sweet Child 'O Mine' and slide guitar in 'Rocket Queen'. But also look out for Izzy's soloing in 'Nightrain' and 'Think About You'. Rhythm players Duff and Steven keep everything tight each track. Many believe 'Appetite' is an overrated album, but do not know the impact it made. The sound is rather outdated today, but the songwriting showcased here is still unmatched, heavy at times but still melodic. All this while staying true to Rock roots. GNR was the band that put good Rock back on the map. However, they would unfortunately soon fall to the likes of Nirvana. This was truly the last time the whole world was exposed to the real roots of Rock 'N Roll.<br /><br />Best moments and highlights of the album? Get a dose of Axl's incredible vocal range in the transition from 'Welcome to the Jungle' to 'It's So Easy'. Keep a close ear out when Izzy and Slash switch off solos right in the middle of 'Nightrain'. Also, listen to when the album shifts from the end of 'Think About You' to the intro of 'Sweet Child 'O Mine'. There's nothing quite like it.'Welcome to the Jungle' to 'It's So Easy'. Keep a close ear out when Izzy and Slash switch off solos right in the middle of 'Nightrain'. Also, listen to when the album shifts from the end of 'Think About You' to the intro of 'Sweet Child 'O Mine'. There's nothing quite like it.
B000007WNN|5.0|Just a slight correction to cedarsurfer...Rick Rubin was the producer on the album , not Bob Rock...Electric is one the best PURE rock albums of the 80's..
B00005JNEI|2.0|This film is based on Michael Moore's oppinion of President George Walker \\"Dubeau\\" Bush and nothing more. While it does have some truths in it, there are scenes in which he blames Bush for doing something that was all opinional. Example. It you asked five hundred people whether Bush should have stayed in the classroom for the time he did after he received the news that America was under attack, half the people would say that what he did was right, and and the other half will agree with Moore and say that he should have left immediatey because Richard Cheney can't run a country. It is purely a manner of oppinion, and because Bush stayed in the classroom doesn't make him a bad person (...).    So, if you are a leftist who hates Bush and likes Michael Moore's oppinion of Bush, this is a great video to get. However, if you want a non biased view of the Bush administration, ask Ralph Nader.
B000002OZY|5.0|Pete Townshend possibly feels a lot like David O. Selznick, the producer of the movie `Gone With The Wind' in fearing that he will only be remembered in his obituary by his creating that one work, as Townshend, like Selznick, seems to have been spending his time after completing their most important work in trying to top it.<br /><br />To my mind, Townshend should have no regrets about not topping `Tommy', as it is easily one of the two or three most important albums and works in the entire Rock canon, similar in importance and possibly superior in quality to `Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and `Blond on Blond', to name just two others high in the ranks of great Rock albums.<br /><br />One thing which surprises me about writing on `Tommy' is how little deep analysis has been essayed about the story behind the songs. In a nutshell, the story is this:<br /><br />Tommy Walker is born while his father is off on some journey (`It's a boy') from which he becomes several years late in returning. Tommy's mother takes up with a lover, father returns, mother and father kill lover with Tommy as a witness, and mother and father tell Tommy he saw and heard nothing (`You didn't hear it'). (If all you have to go on is the recorded performance on the original album, it is not very clear whether it is the lover or the father who is killed. But, printed copies of the libretto say the lover is the victim.) Tommy becomes functionally blind, deaf, and dumb to all outside appearances, however, it is evident that within his own head, he can see and hear everything (`There's a doctor I've found'). He is tormented by various malicious relatives (`Cousin Kevin' and `Fiddle About') and `treated' by various attempts, including hallucinogens (`Acid Queen'). As he grows up, the only outside experience to which he responds is a pinball machine, at which he becomes expert (`Pinball Wizard'). Tommy is finally cured by watching his image in a mirror smashed by, I believe, his mother's lover (`Smash the Mirror'). Being released from his isolation for Tommy is like being released from a practically lifelong mystical experience heightened by pinball. The charisma with which Tommy is imbued by this experience leads him to become a `New Messiah' (`Sally Simpson') creating a movement which expands beyond local resources (`Welcome') and becomes institutionalized into a ritual modeled after playing pinball while deaf dumb and blind (`Tommy's holiday camp'). The story ends with a revolt of Tommy's disciples against his new religion (`We're not gonna take it').<br /><br />The theme of being oppressed runs throughout practically all of Townshend's work, although in `Tommy', it takes a back seat to mysticism. The people who dote on the philosophical background of  `The Matrix' should sink their teeth into the `Tommy' story and ruminate on that a while. The major musical theme of the work seems to be Townsend's search for a magical chord. And, anyone who, like myself, has seen `Tommy' performed live by the original Who will have no trouble believing Townsend has found his chord as he hits that first great whirlwind chord in `Pinball Wizard'. Talk about a rush! In general, a lot of the music echoes earlier Who works. Townshend seems to constantly cut and paste phrasings from one work to another and I have no problem with this except in the most tedious of the three instrumental pieces (`Underture') in the album.<br /><br />Some writers have said that 'Tommy' is more like an Oratorio or a Song Cycle than it is an Opera, but I disagree. Neither of these other two genres requires a plot, and an Opera does, and Tommy has a plot. I prefer to think of it as a selection of arias and instrumental passages from which some bridging dialogue has been left out. My biggest problem with this plot is that the actual event that triggers Tommy's autism is only hinted at in the most vague of terms. It is easy to believe that it was a murder, but the lyrics of `You Didn't Hear It'never come even close to saying exactly what the event was. On the other side of the coin, the great majority of the songs on the album `Tommy' directly support carrying the story forward. Practically the only exception is the Sonny Boy Williamson classic `Eyesight to the Blind'. It is probably symptomatic that only `Pinball Wizard', `I'm Free', and `Sensation' out of the 24 cuts in `Tommy' really work for the Who outside the context of the whole work. That's why I'm especially happy to have seen The Who perform virtually the whole album live, four days after it was initially released. It is also interesting to see that the two cuts describing episodes of sadism were written by Entwistle and not Townshend.<br /><br />This CD contains exactly what was on my original vinyl two record album bought in 1969, suitably enhanced with modern electronics. My greatest respect for Townshend is for creating a classic musical form, the Opera, using an entirely ROCK instrument, with the slightest classical leavening from John Entwistle's French horn on a few early numbers. So many `rock' versions of traditional forms simply overlay rock performances on classical arrangements or make classical arrangements of rock melodies. Aside from `Quadrophenia', the only other work which succeeds at doing this is Spooky Tooth/Pierre Henry work `Ceremony An Electronic Mass'.<br /><br />Listening to this album and every other early Who album reminds one just how much their performances were a collaborative effort between the original four, and how much we miss Keith Moon and John Entwistle today. We can only say that with `Tommy' and numerous other works and recorded performances, the memory of The Who will live forever.<br /><br />Seminal work in the history of Rock.what the event was.

B00005JMEW|1.0|My husband and I are huge martial arts fans, but this is aweful.  Blood and violence everywhere too the extreme that it was pointless.  We didn't even finish watching it.  Obviously we'll be skipping Vol 2.  And that jumping forward and backward in time just gets confusing.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Since the release of Star Wars Episode I there has been a growing number of crazed anti Star Wars fanatics. These people acquire great joy from bashing all the work that George Lucas has done on the series since 1994. They refute anything new and uphold the original trilogy on a pedestal. I scratch my head and wonder; why are these people being so brutal in their criticism on the new Star Wars material but absolutely refuse to employ the same criticism on the original, pre special edition, movies? How perfect are these movies? These movies are full of just as many mistakes as the new ones. In fact critics unequivocally hated the original Star Wars movie, yet it went on became the biggest selling movie of the time. So maybe this lingering negativity is not so unusual, however it has almost become a trend to condemn the new movies and it doesn't just end with the Star Wars sagas. It seems to me that the \\"special effects\\" generation (referring to those who grew up with high quality digital effects in movies) detests the way that modern movies are made, while the older generation that remembers the entire evolution of effects in movies is genuinely amazed at and appreciative of the advancements.   <br /> <br />Where did this start? It started with Jar Jar Binx in 1999 with the release of Star Wars Episode I. Audiences were so displeasured and annoyed with the character that born from this discontent was a craze to hate modern CGI effects. From then on the new Star Wars films along with the Special Editions were disregarded as special effects movies. Where they see nothing but mindless special effects I see an evolving art form. Even with the many mistakes that these movies have I am happy with both the new trilogy and the special editions. However, the \\"special effects\\" generation has spit so much vitriol at these films that I have become increasingly agitated with this judgmental fad. <br /> <br />While attending college I come across hordes of younger people who gather in circles and endlessly, I mean endlessly, complain, complain, complain, complain, complain until I want to throw-up. Everything and everyone is on their hit list. Nothing can live up these people's standards and Star Wars is one of the main topics that these people like to sit around and endlessly smash. It is an orgy of negativity and it quite disparaging to witness. I can't even talk to these people without my subject being attacked at the very moment it slips off my tongue. This segment of the \\"special effects\\" generation hates everything and this negativity toward all the Star Wars movies is being perpetuated by this rigid and unforgiving cultural phenomena. This is fad conjured up by this depressing class of people.  <br /> <br />So Lucas made some mistakes, so the movies aren't perfect. George Lucas isn't a god you know. I'm tired of hearing your endless, mindless and negative bantering!  Just shut your caustic mouth and go away. The only people that want to hear your endless unprovoked attacks are those from your own social disorder.   <br /> <br />Now for my actual review: I own the original movies on Video. I probably will never watch them again. When I think of Star Wars I think of Episode I-VI and the special editions were an attempt to blend the new series to the old. He used this method is reverse when Lucas incorporated antiquated latex effects in the new movies. We can endlessly complain about mistakes in the production of these films or we can buy these films and enjoy twenty years of sacrifice that Lucas has made to bring us these movies. If you're a Star Wars fan you will buy these DVDs and enjoy them, if not why are you even reading this?
B000001F6A|5.0|This album weaves a magical sonic trail through your imagination. Perfect for listening in good headphones, this is one of the best of early '70's psychedelia. The Moody Blues were at that time definitely not your average pop group, sounding at times more like a troupe of Rennaisance artisans than rock musicians. The Mellotron of Mike Pinder and guitar tracks of Hayward and Lodge were, as usual, simply stunning, the melodies simple but dense with nuance and feeling. (Personally I think you should buy a copy of all their albums, but they are my favorite band ever so I'm a bit biased.)
B00005JN2F|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy is an excellent action/thriller that will keep you riveted throughout.  Ex-CIA assasin, Jason Bourne, is now living in peace in India with his girlfriend, Marie, after leaving behind his forgotten past.  When Bourne is framed for the murder of two agents in Berlin, he must return to what he knows best to prove that he is innocent.  At times, the plot is confusing, but in the overall picture it doesn't really matter.  This movie never slows down from beginning to end.  Great action throughout, especially a high-speed car chase through the streets of Moscow, one of the best chases ever put on screen.  Plenty of exotic locations as well with Bourne globe-hopping in India, Berlin, London, and Moscow.  While the plot may at times be confusing with plenty of twists and turns, this is still a great action movie.  It isn't essential to see The Bourne Identity first, but it will help you understand more.  Highly recommended sequel. <br /> <br />  Matt Damon once again is excellent as CIA assasin and amnesiac, Jason Bourne.  He is very believable as a secret agent torn apart by inner demons that he must deal with.  Franke Potente returns as Marie, Bourne's girlfriend living with him in India.  Brian Cox is also very good as Ward Abbott, CIA supervisor helping in the search for Bourne.  Joan Allen plays Pamela Landy, the CIA officer trying to track down Bourne for the murder of two of her own agents.  Karl Urban is perfectly creepy as Kirill, a Russian hitman hired to kill Bourne no matter what the cost.  The movie also stars Julia Stiles, returning as Nicky from Identity, Gabriel Mann as agent Danny Zorn, Marton Csokas as Jarda.  Highly enjoyable action/thriller with great action sequences and characters.  Once again, Matt Damon proves he can be an action star.  For a fast-paced action adventure, check out The Bourne Supremacy!
B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park is a fairly rare specimen. The murder-mystery genre is largely defunct, with most efforts being relegated to TV movies, most of those simple rehashes of previous stories. The movie industry has largely ceded the mystery to the TV series, where shows like Monk and Murder, She Wrote present them in flippant hour-long episodes, and the occasional effort of the semi-regular series, such as Columbo, are slowly disappearing as well. <br /> It's somewhat refreshing to see a period piece as a murder mystery, indeed, and this well-cast film does a commendable job of providing good, solid entertainment. But all of the main players provide more than adequate acting skills, and in the large repertoire of both guests and servants, there's nary an off mark. The dialogue is sharp and focused when it needs to be and demurely sublime otherwise. Kudos especially go to Stephen Fry, playing Inspector Thompson, providing just enough comic relief to pick the movie up just when it seems to drag without turning it into a farce. <br /> The movie largely plays by the old \\"fair play\\" rule of the between-wars mystery writers, where it's conceivable that any viewer can unravel the culprit up to the point of disclosure. As pieces of the mystery are slowly revealed, it all congeals, though when the murderer is revealed it's hard to believe anyone would be all that surprised. <br /> In some ways, this does seem to be a little bit of a waste. Much of the movie builds up an almost unbelievable amount of motive from guests and servants alike, but anyone who's paying close attention knows which ones to discard almost immediately. And, instead of focusing on the bits and pieces of the actual murder-muddy footsteps, broken glasses, the eponymous dog that doesn't bark-it focuses on personalities and motives. This in itself isn't a big deal, and the movie itself pokes fun at itself for just this reason. Alas, the movie also seems to be enjoying itself a bit too much, especially at the end when all of the unresolved issues are closed up in what is supposedly shot-after-shot shocking revelations that are neither shocking nor revelations, but are entertaining anyway. <br /> The movie is a touch too long-the buildup of motives takes too long, considering that most are easily ignorable anyway-and no one actually gets murdered until around the halfway point. But this is a good, sturdy, entertaining film for anyone who is even remotely interested in the subject matter.  <br />
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a classic western almost always ranked with Shane, High Noon, and The Wild Bunch as the greatest westerns ever made.  In the late 1890's, Butch and Sundance and their gang, the Hole-in-the-Wall gang, are riding high as they rob banks and trains while living the high life.  Things change when the head of the railroad, Mr. E.H. Harriman, hires a super posse to track down and kill Butch and Sundance.  Seeing that time is running out for them, the duo heads to Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend, Etta Place.  Once there, they try to go straight but eventually returning to a life of crime.  From their opening introductions to the final freeze frame, this movie never slows down.  One of the first buddy films, the high point of the movie being the relationship between Newman's Butch and Redford's Sundance.  Perfectly blending comedy, action, and romance, this is a can't miss western. <br /> <br />  What makes this movie special is the casting of the two main leads.  Paul Newman and Robert Redford are perfectly cast as two outlaws trapped by their legend in a changing time.  Newman's always optimistic, always thinking Butch and Redford's steely-eyed, quiet Sundance are perfect together.  The two men played the most amiable and friendly outlaws I have ever seen.  Katherine Ross plays Etta Place, the Sundance Kid's girlfriend who loves both outlaws equally.  For much of the movie, Etta plays straight man to Butch and Sundance's antics.  The movie also stars Strother Martin in a great part as mine owner Percy Garris, Jeff Corey as Sheriff Bledsoe, George Furth as Woodcock, and Ted Cassidy as Harvey Logan.  The Special Edition DVD offers commentary from director George Roy Hill and cinematographer Conrad Hall among others, an excellent making of documentary, 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Hill, and Burt Bacharach, widescreen presentation, 3 theatrical trailers, production notes, and an alternate credit sequence.  For a great western with fantastic performances by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, check out Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid!
0783240236|5.0|I don't know what this movie is 'about,' but it's brilliant. There are many theories about what the birds represent, but none of them, not even Donald Spoto's, seems entirely correct to me...Anyway, I reccomend this movie solely on the grounds of its devastating visceral effect. It takes a very campy-seeming premise (most people today, hearing about it, probably can't even imagine it would be at all frightening) and turns into an excellent suspense and horror film. The atmosphere of menace builds with each succesive bird attack - passing such rightly famous scenes as the crows slowly gathering outside the school - until finally, in the last scene (in which the birds are not even attacking), the sense of quiet horror is all but unbearable.<br /><br />The final brilliance of the film is revealed in the 'making of' documentary included with the DVD. You'll learn how Hitchcock meticulously planned the cycles of violence and suspense, how Tippi Hendren had to endure having live birds thrown at her face and body for hours, and, most strikingly of all, how Bernard Hermann created the eerie soundtrack composed entirely of bird noises using nothing but a revolutionary early version of the synthesizer. Also, you get to see Tippi's screen test with Martin Balsam (the detective from 'Psycho'), which is pretty amusing.
0676974112|5.0|I was given &quot;How To Eat&quot; as a gift by my brother...I devoured the book from cover to cover and absolutely loved it's contents.  I have collected cookery books since the age of eleven and have to say that &quot;How To Eat&quot; revolutionised my collection.  I decided to buy &quot;How To Be a Domestic Goddess&quot; and was a little disappointed that it was slightly less &quot;chatty&quot; than the previous.  However, I read it from cover to cover and enjoyed it.<br />I rarely use cookbooks though I love to read them, I use the ideas but not the recipes.  I have been told I'm a good cook...but by my own admission a lousy baker.  My pastry is dry and boring, my cakes consist of a basic all-in-one recipe I learned by heart years ago and consequently all taste the same.  I decided to take the plunge and follow some of Nigella's recipes...wow!!  The difference is astounding and I now bake cookies, cakes and pastry using her recipes.  I use this book regularly (though curiously have never cooked from her &quot;How To Eat&quot; book).<br />I also purchased &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;,I read it from cover to cover in the vain hope of finding it interesting eventually.  Sadly this book is not to the same standard and I have never referred to it for any of the recipes or ideas.<br />I would recommend &quot;How To Be A Domestic Goddess&quot; to anyone looking for inspiration for baking, for mothers wishing to wow their offspring with more than just a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, for young cooks and this book makes a perfect wedding gift.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This film displays all of Hitchcock's genius - his intricate camerawork, his understanding of the mechanism of suspense and his appreciation of humor, as well as more brilliant work by his regular costume designer Edith Head - and I think that for several reasons, it its solidly his best film. For one thing, while films like 'Marnie' have long since begun to show their age, and even such greats as 'The Birds' lose something for modern viewers accustomed to slicker visuals, Rear Window is such a simple story (though not without a great depth of subtext) that it has a timeless quality. Also, the comic script is one of the best that Hitchcock ever adapted, full of crackling dialogue and fully drawn characters.
0676974538|2.0|I bought &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; since I'd enjoyed &quot;How To Eat&quot; and &quot;How To Be A Domestic Goddess&quot; and absolutely loved them.  I thought that this book would be just as good.<br />Sadly, I found &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; too similar in content, same jokes, same opinions, same old - same old.  I guessed that maybe Nigella had said it all already and was just trying to push out another book.<br />Truthfully, I love Nigella Lawson's style of writing, I relate to her attitude in the kitchen, her thoughts and her descriptions of the things she loves...I can't bare to watch her on TV.  The book &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; is directly related to her TV series, I couldn't bring myself to sit through hours of watching her trailing through her home and entertaining her guests, to me its irrelevant.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book, though would strongly recommend the two others above (I didn't read &quot;Forever Summer&quot; since the reviews were not good either).  I am looking forward to the new release in November 2004 of &quot;Feast&quot; and am keeping my fingers crossed that it will be as exciting as her other books.
0064430170|5.0|I first read this book before I knew what words were. Well, I was read the book by my parents. I'm now 23 years old and still love it! It became a family keepsake over the years. I've read it to children I've babysat and to my parents when I come home to visit. I loved looking at the pages, trying to find the mouse. Its easy to read and symbolic in a sense. It's especially great to read to young children before bed, its calming and relaxing! I would definitely recommend this book to ANY parents, young or old, who would like to give their child a gift of a lifetime!
0316168815|4.0|I just finished reading this &quot;lovely&quot; book. I had purchased it a while back and kept avoiding it. I was worried that it would be too depressing. I found it to be anything but depressing. I would recommend it to anyone who is missing a departed loved one. It was warming to read about Susie's ability to see what was happening and being still a part of things going on here on Earth. I am not a big fan of brutality in things I read, but I think that laid the foundation for the rest of the book. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt there were &quot;gaps&quot; in the story and some things didn't really &quot;line up&quot;. But this is fiction, so I suppose the story was written how it was meant to be written!! I read it fast, as it was really hard to put down. Definately worth reading, should not skip this one. I felt really good at the end.
6304806442|5.0|this is probably one of my favorite movies,and one of the few movies ewan macgregor is actually good in (if you dont believe me watch moulin rouge and and those piece of trash star wars movies). <br />Trainspotting centers around Renton (Ewan MacGregor-Nightwatch,Shallow Grave,Big Fish) Spud (Ewen Bremmer-Black Hawk Down,Acid House,Alien vs. Predator)Sick boy( johnny Lee miller-Dracula 2000, Mansfield Park, Regeneration)Tommy (Kevin Mckidd -bedrooms and hallways, topsy turvey,dad savage)and the amazing Robert Carlyle as Begbie(The Full Monty,The World is Not enough,Formula 51) <br />   Spud renton and sick boy are heroin junkies who do almost anything to get high, tommy is a weight lifter who videotapes himself and his girlfriend having sex (although Renton steals the tape, his girlfriend flips out when Tommy says he may have returned to the video store), Begbie is a psycho who beats people up for money or for being \\"doss c**ts\\", Begbie doesnt do drugs and neither does Tommy at first (later in the story Tommy shoots heroin with Renton, and i can't forget that (to quote the drug dealer Mother superior)Sick boy knows a lot about Sean Connery. <br />Trainspotting is part drama part black comedy,the funniest parts are when spud drops speed before a job interview and in a drugged up frenzy freaks the crap out of the the interviewers, and when Renton finds out the girl he slept with is a catholic school girl in high school currently. <br /> <br />Overall this is a really good movie it is not an anti drug movie or a pro drug movie, even to call it a drug movie is a cheap way to describe it. <br /> <br />And to correct another reviewer Trainspotting doesnt stand for herioin, there are people who spot trains all the time its all they do do is stand by the tracks and wait for more trains to go by them, the book and movie is called trainspotting because all the junkies do is get high and get high again and again, as Renton explains. <br /> <br />And one more thing why do people say this a pro drug movie, obviously its not, the withdrawal scene alone proves that. <br />
B0002EXH4K|5.0|While many may say this new remixed version of 'Countdown To Extinction' sounds bad and shoddy, I like it much better. For one thing: It's heavier! Dave's voice also sounds better on this version than the old one. This is my favorite album by the very wonderful band Megadeth. Although Megadeth always lived in the shadow of singer/guitarist Dave Mustaine's former band, Metallica, I find Megadeth to be just as, if not more, talented. Songs like 'Symphony Of Destruction' and 'Sweating Bullets' make this an ideal choice for any metalhead. Up the Irons!!!!
B0002234LS|2.0|It seems like lately too many movies in the suspense genre are trying to be Fight Club or The Sixth Sense. This movie is no different. About 15-20 minutes into the movie I thought to myself \\"This really seems like it's leading up to a Fight Club-ish twist.\\" I didn't think I would be right, because that would just be too simple, and it was too early in the movie. They had to at least have something new up their sleeve even if the flick was a little deriative. Sadly, I was right-- the suprise is basically the same as Fight Club's, however I don't feel this movie earned it like Fight Club did, and thus, it isn't rewarding or suprising in the least. It's as if the producers were scavenging for something that could cash in on this now trendy type of ending, found King's story and made the movie with only that in mind. The rest of the movie comes off flat, and lacks any kind of style and suspense. Aside from a couple nice nature backdrops in shots, almost all the interior cabin shots are too well lit and clean to conjur up any mood of suspense. The only thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was Depp's performance, and in fact, his (and thus, the movie's) best scenes have little to do with the main plot-- those scenes in which he is bickering with his ex-wife and her new boyfriend. Tuturro, who usually is another great character actor really isn't given much to work with. He mumbles threats through the movie with a southern drawl, but really doesn't seem that intimidating, nor fleshed out in the least. He's definitely no Tyler Durden.
0195067142|5.0|As I found outshortly after I first read With The Old Breed...Gene Sledge and I were in the same replacement draft which joined the 1st Marine Division on Pavuvu, British Russell Islands, but were in different units in the division. We both made the Peleliu and Okinawa landings, and his account of both battles--the savagery and bloodletting is exactly as it was. Coinicidentally, I was a stretcher bearer supporting Company K, 3d Battalion, 5th Marines, Gene's outfit but I didn't know that until long after the war. Gene became a close friend after his book was published and we exchanged experiences. With The Old Breed deserves every commendation it has received over the years, from Marine veterans and others We lost Gene to cancer several years ago, but his memory and memoir will live on and be an inspiration to Marines of this and future generations, as will the exploits of the 1st Marine Division in all of its combat operations. Benis M. Frank, Chief Historian of the Marine Corps, Retired.
B00005MCX2|4.0|Although this live chestnut from '73 is hardly worth the $36 new price, it's worth checking out used. &quot;Born To Go&quot; rocks like a truck of horny jaybirds. Lemmy plays a mean bass, and you can hear where the roots of the live Motorhead rhythm section came from on this LP and &quot;Hall of The Mountain Grill.&quot; Disc two is largely superflous.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This wasnt about the Jews, or the gentiles. It was about the Son of Man coming to earth to redeem us, all of us. We had all sinned, we had all fallen short. Certain Jews & romans just happened to be the catalyst that fulfilled the prophecy...They could have been any denomination, but they happened to be in power then (all be it, thru the courtasy of the romans) and that was what was used. <br />I do not in anyway hold the Jews responsible for the crusifixion of Christ, nor do I hope, do other Christians. People were used throughout history to forfill a destiny. <br />Even Judas fate was sad to me as it seemed to fullfill the phrophesy and yet was regreted almost immediately upon reflection. <br />Part of the confrontation however, I believe, was to bring the gentiles band in to the fold. Through Peter and Paul. The think we must remember is God workd on a bigger plan than you and I. <br />Sorry if this is preachy, its just what I felt.
6305079811|5.0|This movie epitomises the very meaning of the word hokey. From it's formulaic story line, lead characters who are going through the motions, up to it's dodgy visual effects. And Yet it's so much fun, it's hard not to like. It's supporting cast, especially Von Sydow whose lapping up every minute of his role as Ming, and more than impressive soundtrack by Rock legends Queen which really bring this movie to life.  <br />It's a pity this particular DVD release hasn't done like it's French(Studio Canal) counterpart, which is presented with remastered picture and 5.1 sound. Maybe this is something that can be remedied in the future. Australia is getting a local release off the Studio Canal masters in October.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This is a great CD and one of my favorites from Rush and I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  I would however like to point out one thing: the origin of the song Cinderella Man.  I looked over most of the reviews (not all) to see if anyone else mentions it but I don't think so.  I really like Cinderella Man and it sort of bothers me when I read that people think it's the weakest track on the CD, or that Geddy didn't know what he was thinking, or as one reviewer put it, \\"it just freaks me out.\\" .  The truth is the song is based on an old 1936 Frank Capra movie titled \\"Mr. Deeds goes to Town\\".  It's a really fun screwball comedy that stars Gary Copper as Mr. Deeds (The Cinderella Man) and furthermore it was quite popular in its day.  So, if you're ever in the mood for a fun classic movie, check it out.  Hopefully you'll then have a whole new appreciation for Geddy's song.  RUSH has never done anything stupid therefore if the song doesn't make any sense to you just check out the film.
630495297X|5.0|I probably own over 100 tapes and dvds on this topic. This one is the best of all primers. A most comprehensive look at this subject with a surprise ending for those of us who had not made the connection with the scriptures. Since viewing this tape the first time and looking for evidence in the Bibcal light of things, the whole UFO mystery has begun to unravel. This tape really does point towards the Truth.
B00003CXGG|2.0|Tell me if you've heard this one from Joel Silver: a martial artist, a singer, and a comedian walk into a movie.<br /><br />The punch line: Romeo Must Die.<br /><br />Romeo Must Die is a slickly produced, big budget action flick that revolves around a gang war between two crime families, led by the African-American Isaak O'Day (Delroy Lindo) and the Chinese Ch'u Sing (Henry O).  They are engulfed in a battle over the sale of Oakland-San Francisco waterfront property, the future location of an NFL stadium.  Oozing all over the deal as The White Man is Vincent Roth (Edoardo Ballerini) who embodies greed in a corporate suit.<br /><br />Isaak has a plan to stop his life of crime after the sale, but his second-in-command, Mac (Isaiah Washington), has other plans.  Ch'u has his own lieutenant, Kai (Russell Wong), who doesn't seem to do much but wear sunglasses until the end of the movie.<br /><br />As a result of all the skullduggery, things don't go as planned.  Ch'u son (Po Sing, played by Jonkit Lee) is murdered, setting off what seems like a retaliatory strike against Isaak's son, Colin (D.B. Woodside). Word of the murder reaches Han Sing (Jet Li) in prison, who immediately breaks out and flies halfway around the world to avenge his brother's death.<br /><br />There, he meets Isaak's daughter, the gorgeous Trish O'Day (Aaliyah).  After Han steals a taxi and barges into Trish's house, the two decide to work together to discover who's really behind the murders. Why Trish should trust Han so quickly, given that he is the son of a rival gang leader, is never made clear.<br /><br />Even more inconceivable is the supposed relationship that exists between the two.  That's right folks, Li is supposed to be Romeo and Aaliyah is his Juliet. The two never even kiss. Somewhere, Will Shakespeare is spinning in his grave.  With the high death toll, Romeo must Die has a lot more to do with Hamlet than Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />This movie is so grossly enthusiastic about its violent content that it actually has special effects to demonstrate how people die.  In other words, instead of indicating that an arm has been broken by a loud crack, the movie shifts to an x-ray vision view of the victim's body, showing the bone break.  It's like Speak n' Spell for action films, explaining in precise detail the damage inflicted just in case you didn't figure out how the bad guy died. This is alternately amusing and pathetic - now we have to dumb down our action movies too?<br /><br />Li (the martial artist) has some amazing action sequences, including the most creative use of a fire hose and zip lock ties.  When he's fighting, Li is in his natural element.  When he's speaking...he's not. The considerably more handsome and understandable Wong should have had the lead role.<br /><br />Aaliyah's (the singer) presence is breathtaking, but she has very little to do in the movie.  Mostly, she complains about her father's criminal activities.  Although Aaliyah's music floats in the background of most of the scenes, all evidence of her musical talent is subsumed under two extremely contrived dance moves.  Worse, Aaliyah's dancing sucks.<br /><br />Let us not forget about the comedian, Maurice (Anthony Anderson).  Big and loud, Maurice is the bodyguard assigned to Trish.  He's also a non-stop laugh machine, churning out joke after joke, sometimes mumbling punch lines that only he gets.<br /><br />The movie's lack of romance, despite the title, is forgivable.  The attempt at a plot (and the inevitable twist) is high-minded if misguided.  But what makes this movie almost unwatchable is the rampant racist remarks.<br /><br />The taxi that Han eventually steals is driven by \\"Akbar,\\" an Indian man.  Everyone calls Han \\"Akbar\\" with a sneer, because clearly that's a name for Indian people who drive taxis, not Chinese guys driving taxis.  Then Han is called \\"Dim Sung,\\" after he pretends to be a Chinese food delivery guy.  The blacks have rhythm, swear a lot, and breakout into random dance moves.  The Chinese are unfailingly polite, grieve in private, and all know martial arts (a trait Han says, with a smirk, is \\"state law\\").  And the white guy is a corporate suit, with slicked back hair and his own crony.<br /><br />Ever since the success of Exit Wounds, starring DMX (who made a guest appearance in this film) and Steven Seagal, Joel Silver has been trying to create more cross genre pictures of this type to attract the hip-hop and martial art crowds. Romeo Must Die simply doesn't have the guts to go all the way with its romance, with its plot, or by breaking any stereotypes.ave rhythm, swear a lot, and break out into random dance moves.

038551123X|3.0|Based on the concept of this novel, I thought I'd love it... and I did love parts of it (especially the first chapter and parts where Dexter was alone).  The problem was with the supporting characters, especially his sister Deborah.  We are supposed to believe she's a \\"great\\" cop, yet she can't do a thing at work without Dexter's help.  I found her constant berating of Dexter to help her figure out the mystery a big flaw in her character.  How are we supposed to believe that she has a shot at being on the homicide squad when she is consistently without a clue as to how to solve a murder?  The other supporting characters (La Guerta, Doakes, etc) aren't much better.   <br /> <br />The character of Dexter is interesting but I hope that the supporting characters get more realistic and believable in future installments.
0743454529|1.0|If I could have given this book no stars, I would have. The writing is extremely self-aware: because the characters each have their own chapters, we don't get into a real rhythm of the story, and then within every single chapter, there are abrupt flashbacks or interludes, wherein the characters reflect on astronomy, or fires, or what have you. Nearly every single large chunk of text ends with a meaningful phrase, something along the lines of &quot;Life's not nearly as stable as we think it is.&quot; This maudlin writing wears so thin, it's a relief when we're not being beaten over the head with the introspection of the characters. <br />  <br /> The ending was a complete cop out, and I thought her choice to not allow Kate to speak until the end was weak; it would have been nice to know how she felt about all this, and hearing it from Anna on the stand was not the reveal I think it was meant to be. <br />  <br /> I was really excited about the premise, but extremely disappointed with the execution. Thank God I didn't buy it, but only borrowed it from the library. <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|To say that Kill Bill is without a plot isn't' exactly correct, rather the plot is quite simple; an ex-lover's pregnant bride-to-be and her wedding party are slaughtered by his gang of trained assassins [she herself at one time a star member of this hit-squad]. She survives, goes into a coma for four years and seeks revenge when she recovers.  Its title should make the level of violence within Kill Bill readily apparent to any potential viewer. And, being a Tarantino film, it's frankly surprising that anyone is surprised.  Suffice it to say that if you subscribe to the Michael Medved school of morality and movie reviews you won't like Kill Bill Vol. 1.<br /><br />Uma Thurman is wonderful as the vengeful bride her, actions set within Tarantino's cool homage-to-the-seventies style.  And what a style it is; everything from the seventies is here, a soundtrack to Ironsides, marital arts stars and a flashy-retro sensibility. It's told in typical Tarantino non-linear fashion with each chapter a different adventure in revenge by Uma. The non-linear style allows the director to slowly reveal the motivation for Uma's character [the character is nameless in Vol. 1 except for her code name- Black Mamba]. The supporting cast, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and especially in Vol. 1, Lucy Liu are fantastic.<br /><br />With violence that exceeds the final scene of The Wild Bunch, cinematography that rivals the best in film and a timeless story of revenge Tarantino has built a movie both exceedingly simple and complex. My one and only criticism is that both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 should have been released as one movie, studio execs be damned.<br /><br />Moralists and those with queasy stomachs should avoid this film. Everyone else be prepared to experience what may be a landmark film, certainly one of the most stylish of the last twenty years.<br /><br />Excellent all around and highly recommended.

0800177177|2.0|I am romanian and let me tell you that the beginning of the movie, insofar as it pretends to portray history, is absolutely ridiculous. First, Vlad Dracul is not the same as Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler) who inspired Stoker in writing his novel, he is actually his father ; second,neither Vlad Dracul nor Vlad Tepes ruled in Transylvania but in Muntenia which is the southern region of Romania. now, I don't know who's the guy talkin' in romanian for Vlad (I heard it was Lux Interior from the Cramps) but I as a native speaker could hardly understand anything.  Keanu Reeves sucks.Tom Waits rules.Anthony Hopkins get carried away.Winona Ryder is ok.Gary Oldman is lame.  so except for Tom Waits's performance (...), this movie is a waste of time and an insult to romanian history.  watch Nosferatu the Vampyre instead
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Its great to see and hear a well established artist bravely enter new territory. Unlike 99.9% of his peers, Neil's not out there giving you what you want. This man is truely an artist. This is no mediocre album put out to satisfy a record deal or to be used as an excuse to tour. This is a fantastic effort and album, and if its subject matter makes you mad, happy, sad, uncomfortable....well good. It means you are engaged in the work, and that is the purpose of art. Most importantly, its great music! Fantastic guitar work by Neil. Read these reviews! Lots of good praise for an album that generating a buzz. Most of the bad reviews (20 out of 220 at this point) are not even about the album, but are in regards to the live show. Some concert goers, expecting to see a nostalgic act and relive some part of their life, were instead given some new music. The second half of the shows were the hits anyway, so those few should of stuck around.
B00023B1A8|4.0|I guess that this is one of the first concerts with Crosby back after all his legal problems.Man, does he sound great here.This is a good concert with some new songs (in 1991) that are really pretty good.I was a little disappointed with the sound in 5.1 mode.The background acoustics really distracted from the vocals. I swithched to 2.0 stereo and what a difference! I usually always prefer the surround sound mode, but the stereo mode was the clear winner here. So much cleaner,especially at higher volumes.  For CSN fans a real winner!
B00005JNEI|5.0|.... a lobotomized, brain dead, moron. <br /> I will guarantee you that he has never seen the movie. <br /> The problem with his screeches of righteous indignation that it is &quot;Lie lie lies&quot;...he didn't name one lie and can't because the words ooze straight from the mouth of the smirking one. <br />  <br /> All one has to do is read newspapers & get their head out of Faux Spews to see that even though Moore might spin some of these to give them a comic overview, what can one do with a would be president who is scared S_ _ _ less & who sits with a doofamous look on his face for an eternity after being told of the attack on the WTC? <br />  <br /> Furthermore, I cannot understand anyone who would vote for this pathetic fool after what we have observed over the past 4 yrs. <br /> Good for Michael Moore. Keep on telling it like it is.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Ok, so, help me out here: Mr scruffy tough guy nihilistic sociopath hit man with hip sunglasses and a killer steel-gray suit(Tom Cruise) comes to L.A. hired to kill six people. He is walking the streets with thousand of dollars cash in his pockets, has vastly superior physical skills, slings and shoots a double-barrel magnum like he's flinging a biscuit to a poodle, and carries a highly sophisticated laptop loaded with a wireless internet connection and a file that includes the pictures, names, addresses and biographical summaries of his six victims. But he needs a cabbie (Jamie Foxx) to take him around the city while he knocks people off? Some guy he's never met and feels no need to kill even though he will be the number one witness to the crimes and the murderer? As for researching the directions to get himself around a city he has admittedly visited many times before -- oops. Kinda screwed up there. Oh well. Let's hop a cab. Most hilarious of all is the arrogant hitman's assertion that anonymity is his &quot;code&quot;. Right -- when I want to remain anonymous, I always make sure to ask a cabby to drive me around one of the biggest cities in the world all night while I go kill people. Of course.<br /><br /> If an appreciation of a work of art requires the suspension of disbelief, &quot;Collateral&quot; requires a lobotomy. A 2003 census of the total population of Los Angeles clocks in at 9,871,506 people. And out of those near-10 million people, two of the key players in the biggest murder to go down that night just happen to pop into precisely the same cab, one immediately following the other. These are merely a few of the many illogical conveniences the film's plot relies on for its story and action to unfold. Yet this wholly unbelievable scenario manages to pull itself off, thanks to the compelling work of Jamie Fox, whose tandem with the brutally suave Tom Cruise gradually rises to a fever pitch of suspense, humor and moral quandry. Fox turns in an endearing and intense performance as an under-achieving cabbie who is hurled into epiphany by circumstances beyond his imagination or control, while Tom Cruise delivers his strongest performance since playing a sleezy and misogynistic motivational speaker in &quot;Magnolia&quot;. The premise the film depends on for its effect is entirely fantastic and challenges even the most boundless imagination, but Michael Mann's script and instinct for suspense does more than save the film: it makes for one of the year's finest movies. If you are willing to relinquish your grounding in the real world in exchange for the thrill ride of the summer, you're in for a real treat. If you want your stories to happen in the world you live in, though, you're looking in the wrong place.ng and intense performance as an under-achieving cabbie who is hurled into epiphany by circumstances beyond his imagination or control, while Tom Cruise delivers his strongest performance since playing a sleezy and misogynistic motivational speaker in &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I was very excited about the original movies coming out on DVD but upon seeing them, I was utterly shocked at the tweaking that Lucas has done with his original Star Wars movies. They were absolutely perfect the way they were and the special effects were perfect for their time but whatever these 'special editions' were aiming for, they miss delivering by a mile. Now don't get me wrong, special edition or not, these are masterpieces without a doubt but after three or four versions of this trilogy being released on the soon-to-be out of print VHS editions, I am absolutely tired of waiting and waiting for the DVD editions of the originals to surface. There was nothing wrong with them and to see him do this to us is really saddening and has badly tarnished my respect for his lack of attention to his gargantuan fanbase to release these classics in their unedited versions on DVD. Why?? WHY?? WHY???!!!! I mean the revamped versions are really excellent but the new CGI effects are so out of place with the much older versions of the movies special effects of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is ridiculous. Okay so maybe he wasn't one hundred percent pleased with the results of the originals but come on!!!<br /><br /> Earth to Lucas, Earth to Lucas. You should have looked at the way they did the Alien Quadrilogy where they had both the original versions of the films along side the special editions of each plus tons of bonus features. The Star Wars trilogy DVD is deficient in every possible way having really lame bonus materials.<br /><br /> I have had it with his act of denying us Star Wars fans our chance to see the untouched originals cleaned up and remastered in their original forms and now I simply give up on ever seeing the original versions of this trilogy on DVD. This was Lucas' chance to really come up with a grand spectacular DVD set but he totally blew it! Do not buy this DVD. Stick with your VHS editions. OUT!!!
B000002C2E|4.0|Much of the cruel and jaded postmodern response engendered by \\"Time Out of Mind,\\" inarguably the most inspired and vulnerable record of Dylan's later years, says far more about the audience than it does about the man. The suggestively titled \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is the work of a man out of his time; an embattled and solitary pilgrim wading the cool winds of a present in which Ashlee Simpson's debut album ranks as the #1 best-seller at Barnes & Noble. That the woman had her own television show before ever recording an album is even more condescending than the music itself: a vulgar onslaught of over-wrought production, kitsch passed off as authenticity and the kind of lyrics an angry 15-year-old scribbles on her dinner napkin after Daddy grounds her. Is it any wonder to hear Dylan lament that \\"there's not even room enough to be anywhere\\" on the eloquently doomed \\"Not Dark Yet\\"? In light of this current climate in which once-encouraging talents such as Jewel, Liz Phair and Sheryl Crow end up taking off their clothes and turning album covers into Playboy Centerfolds, the songs of a broken man moaning from \\"the dark land of the sun\\" with the \\"blues wrapped around my head\\" echo the primal screams of the broken-hearted just as accurately as the sighs of the dispossessed. \\"I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,\\" Dylan wails from somewhere deep inside the immaculate gloom of another raw confession. Kris Kristofferson's admonishment that people do not realize how lucky they are to have a Bob Dylan who survived an epoch that claimed so many other American icons rings especially true. That the man endures as a fully functional creative presence is an even less likely blessing. After traveling an unpaved road where the overlooked comforts available to so many -- anonymity, ordinariness, escape -- are exchanged for the disquietude of fortune mixed with fraud, it is only fitting that this late blues masterpiece would disclose not a man, but the shreds of him, those \\"pale strippings\\" Whitman wrote about. \\"Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think,\\" Dylan screeches in fury and surrender. \\"The diplomat who carried on his shoulders a Siamese cat\\" has given way to a simple man whose \\"soul has turned to steel.\\" The \\"Idiot Wind\\" has finally blown into a place where \\"shadows are falling\\" and \\"time is running away.\\" If it doesn't sound like Byron, that's because it shouldn't sound like Byron. Just as any further production would have made a catastrophe of Neil Young's recent \\"Greendale,\\" the vaguest suggestion of poetry would only distance both speaker and listener from the bitter ruin that is \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" or \\"Million Miles\\" and its plea to be rocked \\"'til there's nothing left to feel.\\" As its many masterpieces suggest -- \\"Lou Reed's\\" unremitting \\"Berlin,\\" for instance, or The Stones' \\"Sister Morphine\\" -- rock 'n roll was not necessarily meant to make you feel good, and it certainly is not reserved only for golden-voiced princes. Albums like \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" succeed not because they cheer us up, but because they acknowledge our hurt. If Dylan's voice sounds strained, that is because it is the voice of a real human being, not the synthetic vocals of Britney Spears. God help a world in which the live recordings of real people have drifted so far from commercial viability as to be called \\"dreary\\" or \\"most puzzling\\" by some of the reviewers here. \\"The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,\\" Dylan yowls at the onset of \\"Can't Wait.\\" Well, so am I, buddy.

B0001906O0|5.0|Ok....I don't have this box set yet, probably because I've made my own complete collection of all the B-Sides. Someday I'll remind myself to get this for the fact that it's an OFFICIAL release while mine is a mere creation of my own work. Anyway....this doesn't lose any stars for the fact that the Robert Smith has answered all the fans requests since 1998's release of 'Galore - The Singles 1987-1997'. If you remember, it was released on (Limited Edition vinyl, cassette, and CD). All formats were the same, meaning it didn't include ANY B-Sides from 1987-1997, don't know why, I guess we'll never know why. At any rate, fans were quite preturbed to discover this so called \\"cheat\\" to Cure fans. 'Standing on the beach / Staring At the sea - The Singles 1979-1985-86' included the B-Sides from '79-'85-'86 (cassette only). That is now out of print, and has been for some time now, 1995 to be precise. SO......without further ado, here you have the long out of print B-Sides 1979-1985, plus the long awaited B-Sides never before released in a collection of it's own, 1987-2001. \\"But...but....but....it doesn't have 'Carnage Visors', it doesn't have 'The Peel Sessions', uhhhh....it doesn't have the 'Curiosity' songs\\". GET OVER IT!!!! I'm sure Robert Smith is well aware of all this and will release it accordingly. For fans who have the albums Faith, Pornography, and Three Imaginary Boys'. You all know Rhino Records is releasing these in expanded editons, eventually. For all that are worried that they have to shell out more money for songs they already have, do it anyway. \\"But what am I going to do with the copies of those albums I already have\\", here's a novel idea, there's a site called 'Ebay', and services within' 'Amazon' to accomodate your needs, use them!! I'm sure any newbie to 'The Cure' will be most honored, and gracious to buy your old copies. This collection 'Join The Dots' has been set out to do exactly what it's supposed to do, to compliment the material that hasn't beenreleased on any of The Cure's albums!
B00002E224|4.0|I avoided watching this movie for close to ten years.  When I finally watched it, through a friend's recommendation, I discovered that it was one of the better movies I had seen in a while.  However, during the first twenty minutes or so, I wanted to throw the DVD out the window: the dialogue was stilted and the acting was forced, but then something happened and I'm not sure what but when they got off the train I was pulled in.  From there on, I found myself involved in an exceptional film.  The dramatic tension was great especially for there only being two main characters throughout the entire move and also not many supporting characters; it's really hard to have only two people remain interesting for a long time if you think about it.  The acting, aside from the beginning, I thought was excellent.  This is a smart, deep, and at times illuminating movie.  I knew it was purely fictional but I wanted the kinds of discussions and the kind of searching those characters did to be real.  Beyond the beauty of the movie, the DVD had little to no extra features, which I felt was probably due to laziness by the people who put it together considering how much hype this movie generated when it was first released.  Nevertheless, it is quite enjoyable to watch these two characters meander through Germany and also through their own lives.

His genius is there on every page, and although he substitutes aesthetics from time to time (there will be moments when you will wonder 'where exactly did the setting go?' or 'this character really doesn't need to be here, isn't that obvious?') in order to wow you with the sheer power of his brain, it is still a great book.  There are so many humorous scenes in this book, especially with Dr Hilarius, that it is worth it to read it just for them.  But beware there is a lot going on beneath the surface here, and even if you're a highly intelligent person, you will still be scratching your head from time to time.  I located an online study guide and followed after each chapters and it enhanced my enjoyment of this slim but heavy book.
0425179877|5.0|Everyone else has reviewed the technical and historical aspects of this book, which I also found enthralling.  However, a side benefit is that it can also be seen as a great how-to book on leadership.  The Mission Control \\"mission statement\\" and the struggles that Krantz went through to lead the fledgling agency are a great study in teambuilding and the power of visionary leadership through integrity.  I've posted the Mission Statement by my desk at work.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Figure 8... what can I say? 15 wonderfully realised masterpieces of pure pop genius. In a single album, Elliott has managed to fully display his unbelievable talent and ability in writing the most gorgeous melodies and stunning lyrics (just take a listen to \\"Junk Bond Trader\\"). From jangly athemns like \\"Wouldn't Mama Be Proud\\" and \\"LA\\" to the typically Elliott, quiet folk-like tunes such as \\"Everything Reminds Me of Her\\", \\"I Better Be Quiet Now\\" and \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\", there isn't a weak song on this album. Rarely does an album come along where every song is a winner. <br /> <br />Ignore the biased opinions that Figure 8 is overproduced. Some elegant string arrangement, keyboards and a few delicious guitar leads here and there never hurt anyone now did it? Elliott made such expert use of his budget to create colour up his songs that they never lose their intimacy. <br /> <br />Anyone who enjoys music as it, without any pretensions, without the need to listen to something just because it's popular or indier-than-thou, just wonderfully written songs, simply must have this gem in their collection. <br /> <br />We have lost one of the most under appreciated pop geniuses of our time. May God bless Elliott's soul...
B00005JN2X|4.0|Seriously Hollywood, dont you make enough money off of merchandise, ticket sales and DVD's? Why should I be distracted from the movie with Bacardi Silver ads every 5 seconds? <br /> <br />It's one thing in ET to drop Reeses Pieces as a cute part of the plot. It's another when the camera flagrantly zooms to the top of the taxi cab to advertise for Bacardi Silver... <br /> <br />please stop cheapening our films. thank you
B00005JMAH|4.0|Overall,I liked the way Alfonso Cuaron directed this movie, but I'm glad he isn't directing any more of the Harry Potter films.  <br /> <br />I thought that, visually, it was the best film yet. Chris Columbus (director of the first two Potter films) went a bit over the top and made everything  look like it was covered in stardust or something. It was kind of a relief to see that Cuaron did not do the same. His approach to the visual aspects of the film was much grittier and geared toward a bit older audience, which was appropiate because Prisoner of Azkaban is the first book in the series to get into slightly more adult themes. I was also impressed with the way lighting was used to give an entirely different feel to some of the same sets. <br /> <br />What I was not impressed with was the story-telling. Unlike the first two films, it didn't come close to doing justice to the book. Important parts of the story, such as the origin of the Marauder's Map, were left out completely, while uneccesary (and extremely cheesy) parts were added in. I was especially disgusted by the adding in of a sappy, worn-out speech Sirius gives to Harry at the end of the film, and by the painfully drawn-out version of Harry's flight on Buckbeak. They could have left out that cheesebally stuff and used the extra time to put in the story of the Marauder's Map, which is one of the best parts of the book.
0800177177|1.0|This movie was a huge let down for me, considering all the great actors in the movie. If you have read the novel and expect to see a movie, do not be compelled to see this movie, it is perhaps the worst dracula movie ever created. It is simply nothing compared to the actual novel. So many of the characteristics of the characters in the novel have been altered. I wonder how a great director Francis Cuppola have created such a preposterous version of Dracula when he has created such masterpieces as the Godfather trilogy. This movie is just so pathetic, so much useless nudity from Lucy Westerna. This movie is a disgrace to Bram Stoker.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|There are no words to describe how HORRIBLE (!!!) this \\"movie\\" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: ULTRA SLOW, SOOO BOOORING, NO PLOT (none!)... and the \\"movie\\" just ends!  Can it get any worse???  Probably not!  One wonders how did this film win ANY awards apart from \\"worst movie of the year!\\"  Rent or buy at own risk.  You have been warned!
B000002I25|5.0|One of the greatest debuts in rock history. \\"The Doors\\" is a brilliant combination of rock, pop, blues, jazz, hard rock, psychedelia, and, even noise rock. And this was released just at the right time... in 1967. There were many great releases such as \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"Are You Experienced?,\\" \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico,\\" and \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" But the Doors' debut isn't any of those albums. It's all those albums combined. The hard rock and brilliant guitar work of Hendrix, the beautiful and melodic sounds of the Beatles, the haunting and prophetic visuals of the Velvet Underground, and the psychedelic drug trips of Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />The band doesn't include a bassist, and none is needed. It's all in Ray Manzarek's work on the keyboard. He keeps the band together. He puts out the most brilliant keyboard work. And he's what makes this band distintive from every other band. Without him, the show wouldn't go on. Robby isn't as brilliant as other guitarists like Page or Hendrix, but his simplicity would inspire other guitarists later on (think of him as a 1960s version of Kurt Cobain). John, like any other drummer, wold keep the beat just right. That just leaves the Lizard King himself: Jim Morrison. <br /> <br />Instead of just delivering plain rock lyrics, he added a twist: He delivered poetry instead. And he delivered them with such a beautiful voice. And his stage performance would set the standard for a rock performance. He was wild and rebellious. Spontaneous at every time. And speaking of rebellious, he would also bring birth to what would become punk rock. <br /> <br />Darkness and mystery is what the Doors brought in the time of what was supposed to be peace and love. Some people would say that the Velvet Underground brought that first. Not a chance. They shocked people, and that was it. The Doors were the guys that made people dance, bang their heads, and go crazy. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest rock albums made and one of the most influential as well. The Doors went beyond what rock can be. They showed that rock can be art not just with Morrison's poetic lyrics, but with the epic sound experimentation in the songs \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"The End.\\" This is nothing like \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or those other albums released in that year. \\"The Doors\\" remains as a timeless classic and landmark in rock music. This is THE album of 1967. And this will remain as this reviewer's all-time favorite album. <br /> <br />Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin...
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The Adventures Of Robin Hood, one of the best swashbuckling adventure films ever made, has come to DVD in a deluxe 2-disc edition that has everything you could ever want in a digital package, and more.  The movie itself is peerless.  Errol Flynn as Robin, the beautiful Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the bad guys, and Hollywood's top tier of British-born character actors fill out the saga.   <br /> <br />That's all well and good, but the DVD is where Warners has really excelled.  For a movie that's over 65 years old, the picture is practically pristine, and while the soundtrack is little more than glorified mono, there are no hisses or pops that I could detect.  And the extras ...  <br /> <br />On disc one we have a commentary by Rudy Behlmer, whose tracks are almost always guaranteed to be as entertaining as they are informative (see his chats for Casablanca or Yankee Doodle Dandy for more great yakkers).  He relays studio trivia, production notes, gossip from the era -- anything and everything.  That's not all, though; there's an isolated music track featuring the score of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, a rousing work that has been unfairly dismissed as being simplistic and overbearing.  Warners also attempts to give us a peek at what it would be like to attend a movie in 1938, with a theatrical trailer, a newsreel, a cartoon and a short subject.  It's a wonderful idea that should be repeated more often on classic DVDs.  Rounding out disc one is an Errol Flynn trailer gallery, with previews for 12 of his movies (actually 11, as Robin Hood has two separate trailers. <br /> <br />It doesn't stop there.  Disc two has two documentaries, one on the history of Technicolor (most informative) and one on the movie itself (pretty good, but a bit repetitive from the commentary).  There are a couple of deleted scenes (without sound), and a blooper reel from various Warner movies of 1938.  We get a couple of short featurettes: a retrospective one on the history of the Robin Hood legend in film, a contemporary one about archery, a travelogue Errol Flynn made a few years before he died, and Basil Rathbone's home movies from the set!  We also get a couple of Looney Tunes cartoons slightly related to the movie, a huge still and publicity material gallery, and, finally, a couple of audio supplements: a radio show promoting the movie and some piano tracks with Korngold himself playing music from his different films. <br /> <br />Whew!  Suffice it to say, this is definitely up there among my top five DVDs ever.  Not to be missed. <br /> <br />The film:  5 <br />The extras:  5+
B000002UB6|5.0|This was THE first Beatles album I've ever listened to. And ever since first hearing it, I loved it and decided to check out things about this album (as well as the band). Unfortunately, I found a lotta negative feedback. Critics bashed this album mostly because of Spector's \\"overproduction\\" and also the band's laziness put into this album. Even though this was recorded way before Abbey Road, it just makes me wonder why the band were in lousy moods on this album, but they seemed pretty content and well-mannered on Abbey Road. One of life's mysteries I guess. <br /> <br />Despite all the criticisms and Phil's overproduction, I see this album as a masterpiece. I've heard great classics like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"Rubber Soul,\\" \\"Abbey Roadm\\" and others, but none of them packed the great and powerful music the Beatles put into this album that I could enjoy again and again. And maybe it's just me, but I love things that are different from the rest. \\"Let It Be\\" is different from the rest of their albums. Chaos runs through this album and it becomes art. Hey, if you can love the chaotic visuals of \\"Surfer Rosa\\" by the Pixies, you'll certainly love this album. <br /> <br />The songs \\"Two Of Us,\\" \\"Across the Universe,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" and a few more serve as the band's greatest acheivements, in my opinion. And if you consider this album \\"overproduced,\\" then won't \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" be considered overproduced as well? That album sounds grander than anything they've made. \\"Let It Be\\" sounds like the band worked at a garage or indie label. And to me, that's something better. <br /> <br />As mediocre as this album is, I consider this to be the greatest Bealtes album made. It shows what could happen once intergroup tensions arise. But like I said before, there are songs here that I can enjoy again and again which no other Beatles album has done.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Milos Forman's AMADEUS won eight of 11 Oscars back in 1984, but has since been given short shrift by those who think Laurence Olivier read the wrong title (Marisa Tomei had the same problem eight years later, when she won for MY COUSIN VINNY).  To be honest, there weren't any instant classics in the top five in 1984, and AMADEUS is still the most famous, so ...  <br /> <br />While I can't really compare it with the theatrical version (which I haven't seen in over ten years), the director's cut is opulent, fascinating ... and really, really long.  The acting by Tom Hulce and especially F Murray Abraham is quite wonderful, as is the music, and the sets are astounding, but it's just ... long.  At three hours, it does tax the buttocks. <br /> <br />That being said, the DVD itself is impressive, with a newly-mixed 5.1 soundtrack.  There's also a commentary with Forman and Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play the movie was based on, and explain their choices in changing certain aspects of the play (last year I played Mozart in a production of AMADEUS, and I was shocked at how much the film differs from the play, not only content-wise but also, in a lesser way, thematically).  Disc two houses an hour-long documentary on the making of the movie, which was fraught with troubles but succeeded despite -- or perhaps because of -- them. <br /> <br />The film:  4 <br />The extras:  4
B000002J09|5.0|I am 15 years old. I started listening to Zep when I was 13, and loved em' the moment I heard em'. My first Zeppelin album was II, which was awesome, I started out only listening to \\"The Lemon Song\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" just because they rocked. Then I began listening to the tracks that took longer to develop, like \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" and then I listened to the whole album in it's entirety. I then saw thatonly did zeppelin rock, but they also had loads of skill at composing, arranging and most of all, playing! After I got II, I got I, which I liked alot, but not QUITE as much as II. I has grown on me though, and now i can't pick between it and II. After I and II i went on a buying spree and bought every other Zeppelin CD i could get my hand on. They are all excellent (with the exceptions of theyre post Graphitti LPs, which are good at best) but of all the Led Zeppelin CDs i have, one thing has always been clear to me... IV (Zoso) blows the others out of the water.  <br /> <br />          IV is an amazing CD, all my stupid freinds think its too \\"old\\" and automatically clasify it as \\"lame\\". well i say \\"F*** them!\\" they like Beyonce, and Jinuine, so i dont think they are allowed to have an opinion on music. I on the other hand, disagree with the large, stupid, immature youth population and say that this is one of the 5 best albums of all time. This CD has quality tracks and arangement comparable to that found on the likes of The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and The Beatles \\"Revolver\\". This CD is always playing on my iPod. <br /> <br />here is a track overview <br /> <br />1. \\"Black Dog\\" - 10/10 - A good ol' \\"let's do it!\\" type song that rocks like hell and has an infectious beat that just screams \\"PLAY AIR GUITAR TO ME!!\\" and i usually do. <br /> <br />2. \\"Rock And Roll\\" - 10/10 - Those damn Cadillac ads have ruined my ability to listen to this great, fast pace rock out. <br /> <br />3. \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" - 10/10 - One of the most emotional Zeppelin songs, along with quite a few \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" tracks and Stairway To Heaven. I just get goose bumps when i hear Plants beatiful vocals in this song (Plant? beautiful vocals?!?! yes, he shows great talent in this song, he could do a friggin Puccini show.) Sorry for ranting, just love this song. <br /> <br />4. \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" - 11/10 - If you havent heard of this song, you have been living in a bomb shelter your whole life without a radio. This is my favorite song of all time, i listen to most songs at medium volume or a little higher, but with this one, i can crank it to full blast. The increasing complexity and pace of the song is just so well done, others have tried, but Stairway succeds. Beautiful song, I sometimes cry when i hear it (yes, im a guy). <br /> <br />5. \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" - 10/10 - Another excellent track. Kinda funky lyrics. The strange is, the beat never really changes, and it doesnt get boring. Only Zeppelin can do that! <br /> <br />6. \\"Four Sticks\\" - 10/10 - A very cool track with real heavy riffin'. Good solid beat. I cant really describe wat makes this song good. but it sure as hell is! <br /> <br />7. \\"Goin' To California\\" - 10/10 - The only gentle track on IV is really quite good. It comes of very innocent in the beginning, but gets minorly more ferocious towards the end. Great song, love the whining vocals. <br /> <br />8. \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" - 11/10 - My second favorite song on the album, after Stairway To Heaven. If I could describe this song in one word, it would be \\"Powerful\\". This song is solid as a brick. There isnt a single quip with the song, i can listen to all 7 minutes without a single \\"How much longer?\\". With some sweet harmonica at the beggining, this is the most bluesy track on IV. This song should really be used in a movie, the levee breaking as an analogy for a squad of troups conquering the other side. i just picture a huge battlefield with one side trumping the other side everytime i hear this. such as solid song. <br/> <br />overall i give this CD 10/10 <br /> <br />for other great Zep, check out Houses of The Holy, I, II, III and physical graphitti.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|Disney's version of Alice In Wonderland has gotten some flak over the years for being too simplistic, and not faithful to Lewis Carroll's original story.  I don't have much of a problem with the movie, other than the fact that it moves a bit too quickly and there are a few too many songs (this coming from a huge fan of musicals).  I think my favorite scenes have to be the \\"Walrus and the Carpenter\\" number, the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, and the caterpillar with the hookah. <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself, it's filled with loads of historical artifacts, but the first disc is geared towards youngsters only.  Aside from the ubiquitous 452 trailers that Disney likes to preview before the movie starts, there are a couple of singalong songs (\\"The Unbirthday Song\\" and \\"All In The Golden Afternoon\\"), a couple of virtual games, a newly discovered Cheshire Cat song called \\"I'm Odd,\\" which was left out of the film for a good reason (it's simply not that memorable) and, best of all for the adults, the Mickey animated short Thru The Mirror. <br /> <br />As for disc two, we have a promotional TV special from 1950 called \\"One Hour In Wonderland,\\" which shows clips from various Disney films and features Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen.  It's only mildly entertaining, but as a historical document, absolutely fascinating (and it contains perhaps the only scenes from Song Of The South that will ever make it to DVD, as Disney keeps handling that politically incorrect film with kid gloves).  We also have one of Disney's earliest cartoons, An Alice Comedy: Alice's Wonderland, in which young Virginia Davis finds herself trapped in a cartoon world filled with lions.  The last of the major specials is an excert from the 1950s TV show, The Fred Waring Show, featuring Stanley Holloway and Kathryn Beaumont (the voices of the Cheshire Cat and Alice, respectively).  It's not very good, but it's nice to have. <br /> <br />After that we have a couple of theatrical trailers, a couple of TV introductions made by Uncle Walt himself, a huge gallery of storyboards, backgrounds, and character drawings, and finally, a couple of deleted scenes, one featuring a song that was cut from Alice but made it into Peter Pan a couple of years later (with different lyrics of course) and the other a daydream Alice has.  Lastly, a few demos of songs that didn't make the final cut. <br /> <br />All in all, a pretty good DVD.  But Disney, where's the commentary?  Is Alicesuch a minor blip on your historical radar that it doesn't warrant a yaktrack?  After all, the movie's only 75 minutes long, and Kathryn Beaumont's still alive to share her experiences.  It's the only disappointing thing about an otherwise wonderful DVD. <br /> <br />The film:  4 <br />The extras:  4
B0002858YS|5.0|It is so refreshing to hear a band come out kicking for once!! The up-front guitar licks mixed with the awsome introductions with the bass are sweet! I can't wait until their next album. Nice to hear good rock from a new band!
B0000CDL93|5.0|JFK is an amazing piece of cinematic propaganda second only to TRIUMPH DES WILLENS, Leni Riefenstahl's glorification of Nazi Germany, in its powers of persuasiveness.  In detailing New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) case insinuating the involvement of prominent businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) in the murder of JFK, Stone paints several detailed scenarios of a conspiracy to murder the President.  These are so persuasive that even though he often goes a bit overboard on his ssumptions, you find yourself almost believing what he says.  I do believe there was a plot to murder Kennedy, although I wouldn't go so far as to implicate everyone in the world with the exception of Jackie O, as Stone does. <br /> <br />At first Costner seems totally wrong for the part, but he grows on you, and turns in a decent performance.  The rest of the actors vanish beneath the facade of their characters, including Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Sutherland's scene in particular is brilliantly directed and edited, as Stone has you hanging on every single word.  Forget Judi Dench in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE -- his is the best extended cameo appearance in the history of cinema. <br /> <br />The technical staff did just as good a job.  Editors Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing blend actual documentary footage with film shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and do such a fine job that you can never tell which is which.  The music score by John Williams is great, as almost all Williams scores are.   <br /> <br />JFK is a film not to be missed.  Film buffs and students will admire it for its technical achievements, and the average moviegoer, regardless of whether they believe the magic bullet theory or not, will see this as top-notch entertainment.  Definitely one of the best movies of the 1990s. <br /> <br />EXTRAS:  The commentary by Oliver Stone is informative, focusing on historical details more than the production itself.  He definitely comes off as an authority on the era, and acquits himself nicely.  The 1992 hour-and-a-half documentary on disc two, BEYOND JFK: THE QUESTION OF CONSPIRACY, is relatively informative, but don't watch it after watching the movie, unless you want to experience conspiracy theory overload (as well, much of it is repetitive, like it's defending the movie -- and considering it was made by the film's producers, it seems almost a tie-in).  There's almost an hour of deleted scenes, with optional commentary by Stone.  All of these are very interesting, and add much to the experience of Stone's vision (especially the scene in which Oswald speaks from the grave).  Two shorter featurettes, on the real Mr X (Donald Sutherland's character) and the effect the film has had on the releasing of related documents round off the disc. <br /> <br />Film:  5 <br />Extras:  5
B0002858YS|5.0|Every song on this album is great, if you give them all a chance thier great. I love these guys.
B0001FR3IG|2.0|I have to be honest. I didn't care for this one. Maybe I was expecting much more than what was delivered, but I kept looking for a deeper plot. Halle's performance was exceptional, but that wasn't enough to save the movie for me.
B00005JMUA|2.0|I have Volume 1 on DVD. I saw it twice in theaters and have watched it numerous times at home. If I reviewed that one, it would be five stars easily. I decided to review this one as a warning. Also, this one will contain spoilers.<br />The problems with Volume 2 start at the very beginning. Uma Thurman (the Bride) is seen at her wedding, in a long, drawn-out flashback. At the end of that scene, and a good twenty minutes later, what did we learn? Absolutely nothing. We already found out in Volume 1 that everyone in the chapel except her was killed. This was completely pointless. Even Samuel L. Jackson's role didn't save this seemingly endless scene. Ok, so then we're in present day. Uma is on her way back to the desert to kill the next on her list, Budd. After a not so brief tale of a day in his life, she finds his trailer and is about to bust in, when he blasts a round of rock salts at her from his shotgun. He buries her alive and then what happens? Another flashback, going even further back this time, to when she was trained as an assassin. This would have been cool if Gordon Liu (Pai Mei, the bride's trainer) wasn't so borderline cheesy. Yes, I know what to expect at a Tarantino flick. The humor is as pertinent as the violence, but Pai Mei was dumbass funny, not cool funny or even slapstick funny. It just got annoying after awhile. So, then she escapes from her grave and goes back to the trailer to find not one, but two people from her list. Elle Driver (remember Daryl Hannah in that sexy nurse uniform in Volume 1?) came to buy the Bride's (they say her real name, but it makes no difference because they could have said it in Volume 1. Another pointless thing.) Hattori Hanzo sword from. In the trailer, Budd opens the bag of money and inside is a Black Mamba snake. It bites him a few times and he dies. To that, I have to say, what the ****? Then, Uma busts in and a fight ensues. Might I add, an hour into the film and this is the first fight scene. This fight was decent, but it ends with the Bride goughing out Elle's other eye. Then she leaves the trailer without even killing her. Again, what the ****? Then, the movie goes downhill from there. And if you haven't seen it yet, I'm sorry for giving so much away, but I think you'll thank me if you were planning on dropping your $20 for this. If you don't want to know the ending, don't read on.<br />So, the Bride finally catches up with Bill. she walks in with her gun and is confronted by her daughter. Not too shocking, since we already know her daughter survived the massacre at the chapel. Now, her whole motivation changes. She goes from a vengeful force to a parent and starts to care for her, with Bill? Ok, last time, what the ****? The little girl goes to sleep and Bill and the Bride finally decide to have it out. But, instead of having a big fight scene with a lot of cool choreographed moves and pints of blood being spilled, they have a talk. After about 15 minutes of pointless banter, they finally draw swords. If you blink, you'll miss all the moves because that's how short it is before she does this heart exploding move thing. Basically how it works is Bill takes five steps and his heart fails and he drops dead. Yes, surprise, she kills Bill.<br />If there was no Volume 1, this might have been a better movie because it built up to this. I fully expected that as she got closer to her goal, the odds against her would be stacked that much higher, especially Bill. He didn't have one guard or suboordinate on his property. Also, what happened to that dangerous vigilante Uma played in Volume 1? In 2, she was actually torn as to whether she should kill him because she might still have feelings for him? Please! The saddest part about this is that it's supposed to be a continuation of the first one, not even a sequel. It felt like a totally different film. I was surprised by Tarantino this time around. I found it difficult to believe that I loved Volume 1 so much and I hated Volume 2 somuch. If you still might be thinking that it can't be that bad, I'm telling you it is. 2 stars is actually a little generous. If you absolutely have to see it for yourself, rent it, but you are forewarned.
B00009V7T2|4.0|This album is not for those who like cute three minute pop songs, in fact it stretches music itself with guitar solos, bleeps, electronic drones, and whatever else the Mars Volta can throw in. It should be listened to as a whole as it shows it's brilliance with repeated listens.  Mars Volta combine Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Aphex Twin, and Yes all into one but maintain their unique sound. What more can be said about this that hasn't been said by the other reviewers, it is amazing music plain and complex. The vocals at times seem like an instrument themselves and the guitar work is as intricate as you can get.  Mars Volta are the good band that resulted from punk outfit At-The- Drive-In. Do yourself a favor and buy this ASAP.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Eminem is such a sexy white boy.  His blonde hair and tattoos and blue eyes make me get all excited.  People say he's homophobic, but I don't believe that.  I really think he's a sweet dude.  Maybe I can ask him out the next time I'm in Detroit.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|It's hard to knock Richard Curtis: as a writer, he's more-or-less singlehandedly revived the fortunes of the British film industry, comedy or otherwise. That said, his vein of humour - gentle for the most part, with alternating bouts of sentimentality and vulgarity - is an acquired taste. <br />Anyone who found sitting through Notting Hill or Bridget Jones a bit of a struggle might want to pass on Love, Actually. This is Curtis in extremis, from the \\"love is all around\\" mantra to the bumbling Hugh Grant character, the big musical numbers to the Christmas setting. <br />There are no less than eight stories on offer, running the gamut from schoolboy infatuation to full-on marital infidelity. Some of the plots are a hoot: I defy anyone, for instance, not to enjoy washed-up rocker Billy Mack's (Bill Nighy) quest for Christmas Number One. There are some strong performances, too - Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are particularly good as an estranged married couple. <br />Elsewhere, though, Curtis's preference for quantity over quality gets a bit irritating. The central romance, between Grant's bumbling prime minister and Martine McCutcheon's tea lady, could happily fill a whole movie. The fact that it's given so little screen time here just robs the characters' final declarations of love of any meaning. Curtis may have intended to create a towering monument to the glories of l'amour, but instead he often ends up reducing \\"I love you\\" to a banal platitude. <br />Still, as an entertaining bit of fluff, this just about succeeds. Fans of Curtis's previous work, and anyone of a diehard romantic bent, will probably find much to enjoy here.
0739420712|5.0|A GREAT APPRECIATION OF THE HOLIDAY HUSTLE WILL OVERCOME YOU AS YOU LAUGH AND GRIN THROUGHOUT SKIPPING CHRISTMAS. ALL THE NUIANCES OF THE HOLIDAYS BLARE OUT FROM THIS NOVEL AND MIX WITH REAL LIFE. WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED READING THIS YOU CRAVE ANOTHER HOLIDAY NOVEL BY GRISHAM.
0060926317|4.0|50 year old Marlo Morgan is on a job trip to Australia, when one day she is invited to a special ceremony. This ceremony is with the Aborigines, Australia's native peoples. She dresses up, expecting a meal and some form of award, but little did she know that this was not just any ceremony. It was a ceremony to prove herself worthy of going on a 3-month trip across Australia with these unfamiliar faces. Only one, a young man who picked her up for the ceremony, can speak English. He becomes her well-needed translator. Despite her protests, she is dragged along with them wearing only a wrap-cloth given to her when she arrived. Shoeless and in much pain, she soon discovers that in order to live through this journey, she must learn the Aborigines' trade. She must learn to talk like them, walk like them, eat like them, clean like them, and care for herself like them. Miss Morgan comes close to death, or seemingly close to death, quite a few times throughout this journey, but it helps her grow and understand more each time. She flashes back to before the journey when she was sitting in a Psychic Cafe in Australia, waiting for a friend. That friend never shows up and a young man comes out to inform her that she is on this trip because there is someone here that she needs to meet. This message appears to her at the end of her walk with the Aborigines' also, but this time she acts upon it. Although she insists that this story is completely true, I only believe some aspects to it. There are a few things that are quite out there, but we'll never know the real truth. This was a great story, and I reccommend it to anyone who does not take offense to other people's cultures and who is willing to learn and listen to the Message in this book.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|I first encountered Edguy when my friend burned a power metal mix CD. The song of theirs that was on it was 'arrows fly.' After one listen I was hooked. So when I saw \\"Hellfire Club\\" the other day, I completely ignored the fact that FYE would overcharge me for it and bought the damn thing. Let me tell you...I was amazed. It's kick-ass from start to finish. There really is not a bad song on this album in my opinion, however the best ones are 'Piper Never Dies,' 'Down to the Devil,' 'Under the Moon,' and 'Navigator' I paid $17 for this at FYE which was a bit overpriced but I am not sorry at all for spending that money, in fact had I known how good this album was beforehand I would have been willing to spend more. If you like Edguy or just power metal in general you must buy this album!!! You will not regret it in the least!
0743455967|5.0|I find Stephen King's novels a little too scary for my taste. That's why I haven't read any of them in a long time. However, this book is different. This is non-fiction. And it's all about him.<br /><br /> The first section is an autobiography of his life. I found this fast-paced and interesting reading and it gave me a bit of insight on this man who has made such a name for himself in the writing world. He and his brother were raised by his loving single mother and their childhood experiences included playing in the woods, a painful ear infection and lots of childhood mischief making. He has only good things to say about his wife; they've been married for more than 30 years and have three grown children and a new grandchild. Stephen King worked hard to learn his craft of writing and money was tight at the beginning of his career. Now, of course, this has changed. But there are still other kinds of struggles. This is all fun reading, especially because he is so good at writing.<br /><br /> The second part of the book dealt specifically with the craft of writing. I found the part about grammar boring. But I enjoyed learning about his personal style and the process of how he works. Some of this reminded me of articles I've read in \\"Writer's Digest\\". They are inspiring. But yet, in all the years I've been writing, and all the advice I've received, very little of it has ever worked for me.<br /><br /> The last third of the book is the story of his terrible accident in 1999, an accident that happened while he was in the process of writing \\"On Writing\\". He was walking along a road and was hit by a van. His pelvis was crushed and he broke a lot of bones. He almost died. This third of the book is about his will to survive and how he coped with the pain and recovery process. This is all very moving and easy to identify with. It was difficult for him, but the completion of this book is testament to his courage. I feel I got to know him as a person. And I like him.<br /><br /> This is a good book by a good writer. He shares pieces of himself that made me understand him. And one of these days I might just read another one of his novels.a good writer. He shares pieces of himself that made me understand him. And one of these days I might just read another one of his novels.
0345350499|5.0|This book pulls you in and you can't help but be moved. What especially impresses me is how it has a sense of accuracy...nothing seems 'cheesy or 'over the top'.  very moving-one worth reading over and over again.
B00005JN2X|4.0|When a normal taxi cab driver winds up with a hired assassin you would think it would be non-stop action for the whole film.  Yet it is not, and that is one of the great aspects of this movie.  Jamie Foxx plays the average guy, a taxi cab driver with hopes and dreams that he understands will never be his.  Cruise plays the calm yet calculating killer who is just trying to get a job done.  We can relate to Fox's character the most, but, like Reservoir Dogs, redemption is the theme here. Redemption in the sense that both characters try to explain to each other, and themselves, why they do what they do only to get a better understanding of their mediocre life.  Both are given the power to change their life, but the story is really whether one will.    The director, Michael Mann, adds to the story with offbeat camerawork, including a lot of hand held shots used with a lesser quality camera.  This gives the movie a more distinctive feel, while the great music overtones Cruise's and Foxx's characters life with mellow serenity.  Actually my favorite part is not the action, yet instead it is the three or so minutes where Michael Mann just does some beautiful shots, all while an Audioslave song, Shadow of the Sun, plays over.  Michael Mann repeats that same kind of filming later too.    In summary, Collateral, is not too quick action wise, has very little \\"gore\\", and has no twists in it.  That is because this is a more intelligently done action film, with great characters, cinematography, and a beautiful score.  I feel that Collateral is definitely deserved of some Oscars.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's success is his own style. And he did it again. Kill Bill is sophisticated and action. I love it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is a sweeping, majestic saga about two old(er) former Texas Rangers - Augustus \\"Gus\\"McRae (Robert Duval) and Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones) who decide to embark on a cattle drive after years spent in a sleepy \\"little fart\\" of a bordertown on the Rio Grande River.<br /><br />Robert Duvall, a great actor, has perhaps come up with the role of his lifetime as Gus, a man who enjoys nothing more than a good \\"poke\\" with whores and drinking good whiskey. A magnificent character who comes to life both on the screen and in the book.<br /><br />Captain Woodrow F. Call (Tommy Lee Jones) on the other hand couldn't be more different. I'm not sure that Call has anything resembling a sense of humour and he possesses zero tolerance for lawlessness, lazy workers and any activity that doesn't involve a purpose i.e. drinking and whoring.<br /><br />I love westerns so it was only natural that I would fall under the spell of this movie. However, I can say with absolute certainty that this would be an impossible movie for anybody - men or women - to dislike.<br /><br />There's no shortage of action in this movie and the exploration of the relationships between both the me and the women is done very, very well.<br /><br />In addition to the main characters - Gus McRae and Woodrow Call, there is also a number of standout performances by many other wonderful cast members.<br /><br />The late Robert Urich, for example, is excellent as Jake Spoon, a Ranger friend of Gus and Woodrow who, unfortunately, is the architect of his own demise. Jake is a character who shares some of the same traits as Gus - drinking, whoring, avoiding hard work - however, he lacks Gus'moral code when it comes to law and order and crosses the line when he falls in with some bad characters who go on a killing spree. When he and his new \\"friends\\" are finally caught by Gus and Woodrow, it serves as one of the most poignant moments in the film.<br /><br />Danny Glover is also excellent as the dependable and personable Deets, a friend and tracker of Gus and Woodrow who has worked for them for many, many years.<br /><br />Anjelica Huston plays a \\"sassy\\", no nonsense former love interest of Gus, a notorious womanizer, who represents the truly independant spirit, which many pioneer women possessed. When they were younger, Gus and Huston's character fell in love, however, poor Angelica could never compete with Woodrow, who she blames for keeping her and Gus apart. I guess poor Gus could never se himself as settled down with a wife and children.it would have infringed on his ability to drink and enjoy the whores he has such a good time with.<br /><br />Little Ricky Schroder plays Newt, an orphan who is looked after by Gus and Woodrow. Unknown to him, Newt is the illegitimate son of Woodrow, although Woodrow will never admit it to either himself or his son. One suspects that Newt is the product of a love affair that Woodrow once enjoyed, but never materialized into something more meaningful and now carries this terrible regret with him.<br /><br />And finally, we have Diane Lane, a young sporting woman named Lorrena, who is also captivated by Gus and his personable ways. Unfortunately, Gus is unable to deliver anything more with her than he was with Huston's character and she qucikly falls in with Jake Spoon, who promises her a better life outside of Lonesome Dove. Of course, Jake is a leaky vessel - thoroughly undependable - and much prefers nice shirts and card games to responsibility.<br /><br />This wonderful and captivating story depicts the trial and tirbulations of a 2,000 mile cattle drive complete with outlaws, the forces of nature, indians and a host of other factors which the cowboys of the late 19th century had to contend with.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the most authentic westerns ever made by America film makers. It's a panoramic 6 hour epic film which is almost impossible to step away from once you've started to watch it.<br /><br />So it you've never seen it before and you happen to insert the film into your DVD player, be prepared to put your life on hold for about 6 hours and sit back and enjoy this wonderful, wonderful film..!!old for about 6 hours and sit back and enjoy this wonderful, wonderful film..!!
B0000UJL96|5.0|Now all six of the original cast Star Trek films are available in DVD special editions, and each one is well worth the price because of the restored sound/video, the fantastic extras, the candid commentaries, and the learned text commentary on each disc by ST historian family, the Okudas.  It's almost like the film itself is secondary to all these neat extras!  Fortunately for Trek fans, this final voyage of the original crew is also one of the best (for my money, only Wrath of Khan is better).  Nick Meyer retakes the directorial reigns, and uses them to craft an engaging and exciting story, interwoven with strong parallels to the real political climate of the time. <br /> <br />The story: an environmental disaster occurs in the Cronos system (containing the Klingon homeworld).  The leader of the Klingons realises he must sue for a peace treaty with the Federation or the Klingon Empire will collapse under its military budget.  On his way to Earth for negotiations, under escort by our heroes in the Enterprise-A, he is assasinated.  Kirk and McCoy are held responsible, tried and convicted, and shipped off to the Klingon Gulag.  They must attempt to escape while Spock and the rest of the crew try to find the real assasins. <br /> <br />Because Meyer is not a Star Trek person, per se, he tried to craft the best movie he could, regardless of \\"Star Trek sensibilities\\".  He succeeds admirably in making a great film with engaging dialogue.  Because the film works so well, and because the characters are cut a little more sharply (Kirk says of Klingons \\"Let them die!\\"), the melodrama is heightened and the payoff is more poignant.  Older fans (like myself) will easily recognise the parallels with the Cold War Communist/NATO conflict (in fact, the Klingon General Chang gets to use Adlai Stevenson's famous Cuban Missile Crisis line: \\"Don't wait for the translation, answer me now!\\")  Other notable Star Trek-isms include frequent quotations from Shakespeare and Chekov's claim thatCinderella is a \\"Russian epic\\". <br /> <br />Basically, the film just works.  There are many small joys in the details of the characters, and my favourite segment in ALL of the Star Trek films is the opening of the assassination sequence: it gives me chills every time I watch it.  Finally, with such a collection of Canadian actors (Christopher Plummer and Kim Catrall join regulars Shatner and Doohan), how could a Canuck like me not like this film?!
B000002TYX|5.0|I've read a few reviews here that claim this double CD is nothing more than a cheap, cash grab.<br /><br /> I couldn't disagree more.<br /><br /> For REAL Beatle fans, it's very interesting and enjoyable to listen to the early, formative years of a band that would go on to not only become the most important and popular band that ever or will ever exist, but also to hear four guys who would change the world and popular culture.<br /><br /> It's remarkable, for example, to listen to some of this stuff that was recorded in the fifties and very early sixties and think about the progress they had made i.e. Sgt Pepper in just six or seven short years.<br /><br /> In addition to the above, the listener is also treated to alot of previously unheard studio outakes.<br /><br /> However, the biggest treat, of course, is the inclusion of a new Beatles song &quot;Free As A Bird&quot;.<br /><br /> This was the record - the Beatles first release in 25 years - taht would &quot;reunite&quot; the Beatles - if only by CD.<br /><br /> Free As A Bird was another Lennon song that was very, very autobiographical.<br /><br /> After years and years of pressure to come up with a new hit Beatles album or film or interview or solo album, John, in the mid 70's when he decided to become a full-time dad and &quot;house husband&quot;, was finally &quot;free as a bird&quot;.<br /><br /> With his wife, Yoko and his new son, Sean, John had finally found the stable family and home that he had always sought. I think this type of life had eluded him even when he was younger and married to Cynthia and fatehr of Julian. Now he had it and he was hell bent to hang on to it.<br /><br /> YOu could also hear John thinking back on his life a la &quot;In My Life&quot; and Strawberry Fields in the lines &quot;Whatever happened to / the life that we once knew&quot;.Clearly, John had a very special affection for those those times, places and people he once knew before he became a Beatle and his entire world was turned upside down.<br /><br /> For somebody younger who isn't too knowledgeable about the Beatles and their music, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a first purchase.<br /><br /> But for people of my generation who came of age in the sixties with the Beatles and the British invasion, this is a must-have CD.e and his entire world was turned upside down.  <br />  <br /> For somebody younger who isn't too knowledgeable about the Beatles and their music, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a first purchase. <br />  <br /> But for people of my generation who came of age in the sixties with the Beatles and the British invasion, this is a must-have CD.
B00006LIRI|5.0|I don't usually do reviews, but I had to put my two cents worth into this one. I discovered U2 in the early nineties, due to VH1 and Achtung Baby's release. I have since purchased all their albums from Joshua Tree up to present. I LOVE all of them. When I first listened to U2 - The Best of 1990-2000 I was a little disappointed, but not disappointed in U2. I was disappointed because you just can't sum up all of their greatest songs from Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop and All That You Can't Leave Behind into 16 tracks. There are too many great songs missing from this compilation. U2 really needs to release a Boxed Set containing ALL the great songs from all their albums. I give this CD five stars because U2 deserves five stars and there are a few songs on this CD that can not be found on any of the studio albums. U2 is simply the Best!
B00005JMUA|2.0|After Having watched the DVD release, I confess I was too harsh.  The \\"making of Kill Bill 2\\" In the extra features agave me a different perspective and I will change my rating to 4-STARS.  Also, there is a deleted scene will DAvid Carradine (Bill) taking on a gang in an old \\"kun-fu\\" theater sword fight and hand-to-hand fight that was absolutely thrilling.  It was a real shame to see it left out of the final cut.  A must buy on DVD.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I found Fahrenheit 9/11 to be an great film for viewers of all political stripes. It was informative, emotionally moving, and even comical at times. As far as the accusations of \\"lies\\" from right-wingers... how can film footage of Bush golfing while he is saying he's doing \\"all he can to find these terrorist killers,\\" be made up? How can the footage of him at a fundraiser for the Elite be made up? How is the heartache felt by the mother who lost a son in Iraq faked? These events really happened-- get over it. This film should be required viewing for the entire American  electorate. It raises honest questions about our current leadership that could fuel informed debate. Then again-- I guess some would rather hide their heads in the sand... Ignorance is Bliss, I suppose.
B00000I41J|5.0|After hearing \\"Kind of Blue\\", I was so impressed by Cannonball that I wanted to start getting some of his own albums.  All I heard was positve reviews for this wonderful masterpiece, so, of course, I picked it up and was enthralled.  This album has the ability to put anyone in a happy mood.  I know this because when I first bought this, I was a bit depressed, but that all went away after listening to this album and Dexter Gordon's \\"Go\\" (another Blue Note masterpiece!).  I love the way Cannonball and the band (which includes Miles Davis on trumpet in one of his rare appearances as a sideman, Hank Jones on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and the incredible Art Blakey on drums) play the over-done standards \\"Autumn Leaves\\" and \\"Love For Sale\\", and make them more exciting than anyone has ever done to these gems.  \\"Autumn Leaves\\" has a very laid-back, but moody feeling, while \\"Love For Sale\\" swings hard.  The title track does an awesome job of showing the formidable solo talents of Cannonball and Miles, and they engage in one of the most amazing interactions in jazz history.  \\"One For Daddy-O\\", written by Cannonball's brother Nat (who appears with him on many sessions featuring Cannonball's classic quintet), is the blues of the set, and the feel is just awesome.  Cannonball and Miles always shined on their blues performances and this track is definitely no exception.  \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" is Cannonball's individual showcase, and boy does this track haunt me!  The way Cannonball handles this often-done standard has the ability to move me to tears.  Finally, the track finishes with \\"Bangoon\\" a Hank Jones original that wasn't included in the original album, which provides a worthy ending for an incredible album, which is in my opinion the best album jazz has to offer!
B0000026NC|4.0|This 2-disc live set is a great collection, especially for fans of the \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" album, as this is recorded from that tour. Though I love \\"The Wall\\" most, I actually listen to this even more. Maybe that's because I have it on cassette, cd, and vinyl. Anyway, other than the inclusion of 6 tracks from \\"AMLOR\\", it also has 9 of their biggest and best songs. My personal favorites here are \\"On The Turning Away\\", \\"One Of These Days\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". Overall, great album title, great photos, and excellent music. There's also the live \\"Pulse\\" collection from 7 years later if you want to look into that. Either of these is a good way to spend your \\"Money\\".
B00003CXCT|3.0|I want to agree with most of the reviews here. <br />  <br /> The original series was excellent, and I do not like all the changes and extra CGI George Lucas added. I own a set of LaserDiscs of the series AFTER remastering and BEFORE all the changes, and I will not be replacing them until a proper version of the DVDs, with the original effects and scenes exists. <br />  <br /> However, if we go by Mr. Lucas' track record on Episodes I & II (which I thought were pretty awful movies) he has lost touch with his audience and can't imagine why everyone doesn't like his &quot;improvements&quot; He is lost in a world of CGI for CGI's sake! <br />  <br /> So, 5 stars for the original series, and 1 for this DVD set with the altered versions. <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|Was fortunately able to rent this in Europe MONTHS before the US release.  Was surprised by that... <br /> <br />Would have given it a 4.5 if I could have.  Not a perfect movie by any means, but still one that jars you, stuns you, and pokes you uncomfortably enough to either be: 1) turned off totally (as one reviewer was) or 2) inspired to really contemplate the message being portrayed in the movie.  What this movie focuses on ISN'T the warm and fuzzy niceness of being human. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman portrays a woman in some sort of trouble, who turns to the folks in a small Colorado town to help protect and hide her.  They reluctantly do so at first, but then slowly discover their position of power over the woman isn't so uncomfortable after all. And eventually, almost every person in the town begins to exploit the woman's predicament, and their begrudging pseudo-benevolence slowly mutates into horrific abuse. <br /> <br />The entire movie is shot on a sound stage resembling a large-scale play set.  Minimal props and effects give the whole story a surrealistic feel.  The characters and their costumes are the only completely made up items in the movie. <br /> <br />Not a big Lars Von Trier fan, as he seems quite the pretentious **** at times, and yes, there does seem to be an anti-American slant to his work, but the themes and ideas presented in this movie definitely aren't unique to the U.S.  Several non-American friends of mine didn't see the movie as necessarily an American-bashing flick.  Its message is bit more universal than that. <br /> <br />Similar themes have been presented in other stories (\\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" came to mind during the film) where we examine a small isolated group of people, trying to define what's moral, what's just (and excessively patting themselves on the back for doing so), but ultimately failing miserably and ending up even further away from the humanity they're proclaiming to represent. <br /> <br />Outstanding performances in the film, despite the stage-like setting and minimal props, from Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, et al.  You get the feeling that Von Trier kept things tense on the set, just to add to the overall feeling. <br /> <br />If you want to buy/rent a \\"feel-good\\" flick, then this isn't the one to get.  If you want an insightful and thought provoking story though, this one delivers.
B00003CXCT|2.0|There is no reason why both the original and Senor Lucas' remake should not be on these discs.  Sure it has been said before, but if enough people sau it maybe Almighty George would listen.  Ain't buying it!
B00005JN2F|4.0|You can tell 'Bourne Identity' was a sleeper hit just by looking at the scope of 'Bourne Sumpremacy' - India, Moscow, New York, Berlin and other locales - in particular, huge, costly, shut-down-the-streets production pieces in Berlin and Moscow.  And, there's no doubt it makes for a riveting two hours of cinema.<br /><br />I've seen reviews that say 'surpasses the original.'  I'm not sure of that.  I liked the cleaner storyline of the original, plus more of Chris Cooper and (especially) the wonderful Franka Potente.  Furthermore, the original was such a pleasant surprise - like most people, I went on a whim with no expectations and was really taken in by Dougie Liman's direction and the raw intensity of Matt Damon's performance.  [Mr. Damon's internal gyroscope - the one that sniffs out good roles in well-made films - continues to function flawlessly. Erstwhile buddy Ben Affleck ought to be taking notes.]<br /><br />Two comments here about the Russian antagonists in the film:<br /><br />- In the book, this is a Cold War confrontation, government-to-government.  In its film incarnation, in order to have present day significance, screenwriter Tony Gilroy had to do a major overhaul to make it more of a quasi-corporate skirmish with an ear skillfully tuned to modern-day Russian Oligarchism.  My compliments - it's a masterful job turned in by Mr. Gilroy.<br /><br />- I couldn't help but stifle a laugh at 'Gretkov,' Karel Roden's oligarch-like character.  He's got it nailed, from his Khordokovsky-like wireless-rimmed glasses to his Abramovich-like perfectly coiffed four-day or so stubble.  Bravo, Mr. Roden.  You've done your homework well.

B00005R2IS|5.0|Mel Gibson has a history of playing borderline psychotic, revenge-driven loners from contemporary actioner Martin Riggs (\\"Lethal Weapon\\") to widescreen epic hero William Wallace (\\"Braveheart\\") to hard-boiled noir tough guy Porter (\\"Payback\\") to historical fiction family-man-pushed-too-far Benjamin Martin (\\"The Patriot\\") to the classic Shakespearean originator of the mold Prince Hamlet (\\"Hamlet\\").  You could almost say it's his niche.<br /><br />And in all fairness, he started young.  Mel Gibson was an impossible 21 years old when he starred in this 1979 throwback to 1960's biker thrillers produced by the then-unknown team of George Miller and Byron Kennedy.  A huge hit in Australia, it was limited to small theatres, drive-ins, and arthouse runs in the United States...where, despite a dubbed dialogue track that would make most kung fu movies seem Academy Award-worthy, it picked up a loyal cult following and enabled a small group of would-be hipsters to be able to say \\"Mel Gibson?  Oscars? P'shaw...he'll always be 'Max Rockitansky' to me.\\"<br /><br />The movie is not exactly original...it's a redux of the American western with elements of the aforementioned biker flicks, but it is VERY original in its use of some very innovative cinematography (cameras mounted at fender-level on fast-moving cars...I'm not certain it had ever been done before) and some of the more unbelievable stunts ever filmed, the like of which would not be seen again until the sequel's release in 1982 (\\"Mad Max 2\\" or \\"The Road Warrior\\", depending on your location).  The action is more personal because it is REAL.<br /><br />Mel Gibson's performance might not seem on par with his better roles since, but the role he was playing was that of someone much older than himself at the time...and it can't be denied that even at 21 he had a command of the camera he has never relinquished; you can't take your eyes off him.  Of his earlier roles Gibson is rather self-conscious of his performance in \\"Mad Max\\"; he refers to himself as \\"Mr. Porkchop\\" in this movie, somehow under the impression that he must have been overweight at the time...but fans of his will want to see this movie to see how he looked before his days as a household name and to chart his development as an actor.<br /><br />Fans of action movies will want to see how movies of this nature looked in the \\"old skool\\" days before high-budget special effects when the level of action in your movie was dictated by how far your stuntment were willing to push the envelope of sanity.  In Australia during the making of this movie and \\"The Road Warrior\\", it fast became evident that no such envelope even existed.  The result is a piece of hand-made brilliance of guerilla filmmaking that would inspire latter day innovators such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez into accomplishing so much with so little.<br /><br />And of course the fact that this DVD is equipped with the Australian dialogue track is a selling point unto itself (it also  shows exactly why a dub track was used for US distribution; it's not that we can't understand the accent, mates...we just have no idea what the slang means).  That and the commentary track by the production team make well-received treats for those of us who are old enough to have loved this film since its original release.  A retrospective on Mel Gibson's career and its beginnings is also a nice addition.

B0000AI44Q|4.0|well first i am a big neil young fan so take it as it is. I really think this is a great piece of work . hes back to a very smooth voice and talk style no loud yelling which i think is the true sound for neil. the cuts devils sidewalk and carmichael are great songs done in the neil young way with great harmonies and the great sing song way singing very clear with his vocals sounding at top form. if you are a true neil young fan i think you wont have to listen to much of this cd to understand why i put it up there just under harvest moon and comes a time its rock done in a softer way. i really give this cd a big thumbs up. <br />
B000002A3T|4.0|This album is far superior to its predecessor, A Momentary Lapse of Reason.  David Gilmour is the dominant composer on this album, whose noteworthy contribution to this album is \\"High Hopes.\\"  However, The Division Bell is incredibly long and Dave definitely throws in some bad tracks, such as \\"Take it Back\\" and \\"Lost for Words.\\"  This album is so long that it could have dumped the filler and still been a very comfortable 45 minutes. <br /> <br />The real difference that sets this album apart from AMLOR is that Rick Wright is back in action, composing and singing on \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\", an album highlight.  He cowrites the instrumentals \\"Cluster One\\" and \\"Marooned,\\" both of which are very nice to listen to.  The tracks written by both Rick and Dave seem to naturally sound the most like Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />So if you were dissapointed by the 80s Gilmour solo effort mistakenly billed as \\"Pink Floyd,\\" pick this up and I think you'll find a few tracks worthy of that title.
B00005JNA2|5.0|DVD extras:  Not much, just the theatrical trailer and a 10-minute segment called \\"on the set of Before Sunset\\", which intersperses bits of interviews between the two actors and the director.  I think most people would find it mildly interesting but definitely not essential.<br /><br />The film itself:  \\"Before Sunset\\" is the sequel to \\"Before Sunrise,\\" a wonderful little film from 1995.  You don't have to see that film first, but I'd recommend doing so anyway, because it's very good, and because it increases the emotional impact of \\"Before Sunset\\".<br /><br />If you have seen \\"Before Sunrise\\" and liked it, you will almost certainly like \\"Before Sunset.\\" If you found it boring or otherwise unappealing, then skip \\"Sunset.\\" The two films share a lot in common: an overwhelming focus on the two main characters, lots of good dialog, and a very sweet love story.<br /><br />There are a few differences:<br /><br />The acting is better in \\"Before Sunset.\\" The Jesse character (Ethan Hawke) is more likeable in \\"Before Sunset\\" (some people found him slightly annoying in the prequel). In the sequel, there seems to be more tension: they only have 80 minutes rather than a whole night to figure out if they should be together. There's also more at stake: it's so rare in life to find someone with whom you truly connect, and if you let them go, it's even more rare to get a second chance with them later.<br /><br />Many people who really liked the prequel said that seeing the sequel gave them the sensation of visiting old friends. I felt this too.<br /><br />I *URGE* you to be very careful about reading other user reviews. Most reviews I've seen give too many hints about the ending.<br /><br />Those of you who have already seen this film may be interested in discussing the ending. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, STOP READING NOW!<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT! ***<br /><br />Most people have an opinion about the ending of \\"Before Sunset.\\" Some love it, some hate it, but most are frustrated by the ambiguity, at least initially. Do they stay together? Or does each of them return to their committed relationship?<br /><br />We can't be certain what happens, but the writers (Linklater and the two lead actors) have given us some very strong clues.<br /><br />In the final scene, the song playing on Celine's stereo is called \\"Just in Time,\\" performed by Nina Simone. Simone is famous for singing very moving, haunting, sad songs. But \\"Just in Time\\" is quite happy: \\"Just in time/I found you just in time/before you came, my time was running low/I was lost/the losing dice were tossed/my bridges all crossed/nowhere to go/Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going/no more doubt or fear/I've found my way/For love came just in time/you found me just in time/and changed my lonely life.\\"<br /><br />Why do you think the writers picked that song?

The last thing Celine says to Jesse is \\"Baby, you're going to miss that plane,\\" and the last thing he says to her is \\"that's right\\" (or something to that effect).

0312995423|2.0|This book should be a perfect manuscript for a bad tech-movie (think &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;). There are a lot of cheap suspense tricks scattered over the book, and the cryptography/computer world is pictured very stereotypically.      Many things in the book are very farfetched, but not as many reviewers here seem to think, entirely implausible. For instance, the author does mention that TRANSLTR has _quantum computer_ elements in it, making it quite distinct from the &quot;normal&quot; computers (&quot;Turing machines&quot;) of the rest of the world. While currently only a theoretical possibility (there is active research going on in this area and there have been some recent advances), a quantum computer has the possibility to solve so-called NP-complete problems in polynomial time. As far as I know, it is not known whether factorising large numbers is an NP-complete problem or not, but there certainly is the possibility that it is. And it is very possible that a quantum computer may be able to factorise very large numbers, and thereby crack for example RSA-encryption, in very short time indeed. The time needed to find the key would not need to be increasing exponentially with the key-length, but could be a polynomial function of it. And - voila! - you could crack a 1 million bit key in a few hours instead of a gazillion years.      After all, this is fiction, and while I agree that even in fiction a story should be believable to be interesting, most elements in this story are, if your willing to stretch your credulity a bit. I don't find it impossible (although unlikely) that a virus could be fed into TRANSLATR the way it is described in the book, especially by a former employee that supposedly has good knowledge of the system. After all, it was only a few years ago it was thought that viruses could not spread via email (because email only conveys text messages, right?) and look what now is the major distribution channel of viruses. Trivial mistakes, like thefact that 64 bits doesn't equal 64 characters and so on are minor nuisances and in my opinion not really detracting much from the story. Worse is the irrational way supposedly intelligent people act. Just saying that a person is very smart is not enough; she also has to behave intelligently to convince the reader.      But what I found to be the real show-stopper in this book was the central theme itself. I can accept that there may be a super-advanced computer with quantum computer capabilities and advanced self-training algorithms that can solve all known encryption methods in minutes, and even crack new encryption algorithms just by some clever brute-force algorithm search. But what I cannot accept is that being unable to decode a string of characters implies there is an unbreakable encryption algorithm! It's plainly silly. A good encryption algorithm makes the encrypted message look like random nonsense. Well, what if it _was_ random nonsense? Then no-one would ever be able to decrypt the message, because there would be no! TRANSLTR could run for an infinite amount of time on that random string without finding the solution.      All-in-all, this is not the worst book I have read, it was quite thrilling in some passages, but ultimately it was a silly and disturbing book, perfect for a bad Hollywood film. I have not read the da Vinci code, but from what I've heard it should be much better than this one, so I will still give it a try.
B00008EY65|3.0|I loved Blade II but this one dragged in a few places. The first 30 mins blew me away but once the middle section and finale set in it's fairly by the numbers.<br /><br />Ron Perlman is perfect and John Hurt does a great job. Salma Blair is blah (not just in this flick) and so is the othe guy. Perlman saves the day as does the skill of Del Toro. He sure knows how to deliver what's required of a comic book superhero. Love to see him tackle something sicker next time - like a H.P. Lovecraft adaption or something. Can't think of another director working today who would be better suited to bringing that author's works to life. To date there's only been 1 decent Lovecraft movie (86's Re-Animator). C'mon Del Toro -do your worst.<br /><br />For those \\"other\\" directors claiming to be the future of horror. There's only 1 Guillermo Del Toro and he's raised the bar higher than the others can jump I think... Go Guillermo! You're the modern day Sam Raimi. (when Sam used to do horror)<br /><br />I usually prefer slasher flicks but this monster movie was pretty cool.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|You can't criticize music just because it wasn't what you expected. Avril Lavigne's style has grown up and out. She's improved a lot.  <br />This c.d. is one of my three favorite c.d.s of all time. There aren't any fill-'er-up tracks. I was really impressed when I read that all of Avril's songs come from an experience. I give credit to any artist who writes their own songs, and even more to Avril Lavigne.  <br />I would write more but I have to go... <br />Take a listen for yourself before you go judging stuff on other people's opinions.
B00003CXCT|5.0|As a child, the Star Wars films were the definite shaping influences in my life. I loved these movies with all my heart. I am thrilled to be getting these films on DVD...including the changes. Ok, I am on board with the whole Greedo shoots first debacle, but otherwise I feel like most all of these changes improve on the films. Personally speaking, I feel that it is entirely hypocritical to hate the prequels and love these films, seeing as they are in much the same mold. To hate a sci-fi/fantasy film because it had too many SFX?! Whatever..the point is that these films are classics and the moves to tie the saga in tighter to continuity is a move that I am happy for, and as for the originals being re-released (untouched), I guess it doesn't matter to me as much...only us old fogeys will care about that anyway, the kids will not like them so much, I think. A must buy for any true SW fan.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|What gets me the most where Avril is concerned is the way this pop garbage dressed up as faux-punk is spewing out all these little punk rocker wannabes who don't even know the true meaning of the culture. Punk isn't just about wearing ties and going to Hot Topic. Punk is deeper than clothing style. Punk is being your own person and real punk values intelligence as it escapes the mainstream garbage. It's about thinking for yourself. It isn't about crying over a boyfriend. What is punk, you might ask? The Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, just to name a few. Good Charlotte? Ummm...no. Avril? Definitely not! It's people like Avril who are ruining the true heart and soul of punk and turning it into this mainstream crap people are trying to escape from. It's just turning it into pop culture, into something unintelligent, and making it so 'teenybopper-ish'. Please, don't support this cruddy cd. Support real artists with intelligent lyrics and good policies. Go to the alternative tentacles website and purchase a nice Jello Biafra spoken word cd or a Dead Kennedys cd. Don't give into this poser-clown. Support real artists and intelligence!  <br /> <br />I'm begging you!
B0000256KE|5.0|Roxy Music's second album, and last with Eno, is quite possibly their greatest achievement. The entire album is wrought with tension and angst. Sonically its fantastic, with Eno treating the various instruments electronically, which leads to a very alienated feeling by the listener. This CD has no filler, 8 tracks 8 classics, but 8 very very different songs. Blue Lagoons is the closest thing to upbeat this album has to offer, and even that has its weird moments. However, songs like Do The Strand, Editions of You, In Every Dreamhome a Heartache and Bogus Man each show a VERY different side to Roxy Music, each very dark and deliberate in their delivery. The piece de resistance though is the closer/title track, which devolves from a sad song to a cacophony of delay feedback and warped piano tones.<br /><br />Along with Country Music, this album defines what Roxy Music was about, what they could do, and why they continue to inspire musicians today.
B00005JN2X|4.0|\\"O' Oscar, Where Art Thou?\\" is a phrase that Hollywood super-star Tom Cruise has become all too familiar with, especially as of late. Ever since his break out in Risky Business, a film, as good as it may be, is hardly Oscar material, Cruise has made numerous attempts to take home the golden statuette by taking on roles in such high-profile dramas as Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, and Magnolia, only to come up nearly empty handed (he received Best Actor nominations for his roles in Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia). But his last two films (Minority Report and The Last Samurai), quite possibly the best chances at an Oscar nod in years based on critical as well as public acceptance, failed to produce even a nomination. Does this affect his career, let alone his own self-esteem for his craft? Hardly! Cruise continues to take risks as an actor, which includes performing in a role that doesn't suite his personality: the villain.  <br /> <br />The story centers on an ordinary man living in the big city just trying to make a decent living as a cab driver until one day he picks up the wrong guy at the wrong time and becomes embroiled in a situation he never could have imagined. For twelve years Max has been a cab driver in the city of Los Angles, a position that he envisioned would only be temporary until he saved up enough money to start his own limo service, one that would be like a \\"club experience\\", but some things in life don't always work out the way we envision them. Take for instance, one night Max picks up a man named Vincent, a person who one would describe as well put together, who \\"hires\\" him to drive him around to five locations that night for double the amount of money he would normally make in a single night. Max, believing him to be a decent hardworking guy, agrees to the deal only to shockingly discover that his occupant is actually a contract killer sent by a narco-trafficking cartel to eliminate five individuals, both witnesses and prosecutors, involved in a federal grand jury trial set to take place the next day. Though Max tries everything in his capacity, which, at times, can be quite limited, to escape, Vincent forces him at gun-point to drive him around to each location. As the increasingly distressing night drags on, Vincent and Max become more dependent on each other and begin to reveal within themselves aspects of life they never once considered before - aspects that will change the course of their own lives forever. The story for Collateral is not all that complex and, in a sense, remains fairly predictable from beginning to end but the way Michael Mann successfully blends an intoxicating atmosphere with sympathetic characters and brilliantly choreographed action sequences, that feel neither drawn-out nor short-lived, that make it the most fascinating storylines this season. <br /> <br />One of the most striking aspects about the film is the way the filmmakers allow a small group of performers to carry the entire feature without missing a beat. Though several background characters are brought in and out throughout the film's two hour time length, they are, in essence, meaningless to the audience as many of the main actions occurring on screen primarily affect the relationship between Vincent and Max, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Tom Cruise, who is better known on the big screen for playing the hero rather then the villain, could have been disastrous had he ended up like most actors who break their usual mold, but he demonstrates that he's just as good, or even better, being bad. The grey-haired, clean-cut Vincent may seem intelligent and even debonairish in certain respects, which makes the character all the more enticing, much in the same way Anthony Hopkins portrayed Hannibal Lecter ... a person so interesting and majestic that you can't help but root for him at times, though in your heart you know should be hating his guts. The other reason the character works so well is the way his acts and reacts with the character of Max the cab driver, played by Jamie Foxx. The film starts off with Max as the weak-willed, cautious pawn in the grand master-plan that he can't control, but as time goes on and their conversations become more and more profound, his personality changes in such dramatic fashion that it snaps the audience's moral compass back in line by having them root for the man they should be interested in from the beginning.  <br /> <br />Overall, Collateral started like any other film and could have ended up the disaster it should have been (based on the clear-cut final sequence it finished with) but its impressive cast, tense atmosphere, brutal violence, and, more importantly, its austere message make this film the sleeper hit of the summer. The ending is not disappointing in the sense that is flat or uninteresting but rather that if one figures out early on that Jada Pinkett-Smith's appearance in the film is more then just a mere cameo (if you caught the appearances on the late-night talk shows, this should be a given to you), the way the film wraps-up isn't all that surprising. But this hardly deters the audience from having an enjoyable experience none the less. The aspect, one that literary wizards will adore, that sets Collateral apart from other thrillers is the Richard III-ish affect it has on the reactions of the audience. Early on, we should be hating Vincent, a man who viciously kills people without any second thought, but the character is ten times more interesting then Max, who comes off as a cautious neat-freak rather then a hero, that we are easily attracted to him and, dare it be said, root for him even though we know deep inside that we should be loathing his actions. Only when the real hero emerges in Max and he finally begins to escape the precarious shell he has kept himself in do we begin to shift our attention to the person that deserves it the most. Collateral's message, one that is hammered further and further into the minds of movie-goers as the story unfolds, that life should be lived to its fullest and one should take advantage of every minute of every day. This may sound simple and even clichd but once you've seen this film, it's easier to understand and therefore take to heart once you've exit the theater.

B00005JLO2|5.0|Once again a really good, almost epic, film is overlooked by a great majority. This movie is well worth its weight! <br /> <br />The story begins in 1880 England with a handful of British soldiers preparing for war in Sudan. One soldier falls in love and makes the unheard of decision to leave the army rather than face death. But the very reason the soldier quits blames him for being a coward and the relationship ends. The soldier, played respectfully well by Heath Ledger, becomes an outcast but finds his way to the Sudan in order to help his friends. Watch the movie for the complete story because it is complicated, deep and troubling. The question that comes to mind is what would you do for your friends? Just how much should a brave man sacrifice in order to be courageous and accepted in society? This movie will bring about all sorts of deep rooted questions about the rights and wrongs of war and friendships. <br /> <br />In my opinion the best actor in this film is Djimon Hounsou who plays a desert wanderer who rescues Heath Ledger in the Sudanese desert. Hounsou believes that God has placed Ledger in his path and that he is responsible for protecting him during the rest of the film. Again the question of what qualifies as a friendship enters the mind. Is a true lasting friendship worthy of death? I believe we would all be so lucky to fall into the path of such a man as Hounsou portrays....they are few and far between. <br /> <br />The main focus of this film is the war between the British and the Sudanese. The scenes are well directed and powerful. The fancy professional soldiers don't stay pretty for long in the brutality of the desert. It becomes apparent that as usual a big powerfully choreographed army does not have all that it takes to fight native warriors protecting their land from invasion. The British expect the nomads to fight a war exactly as they do without taking into consideration the history and behaviors ingrained within such people who fight withswords and brutality rather than pumped up ammunition. It all sounds somehow familiar! Needless to say you may begin to look at the rights and wrongs of war after watching this movie. Is it really right to take over another country without permission from the occupants? <br /> <br />As I said many questions will arise during the viewing of this film, it is deep and moving with reflection. Interestingly enough the message contained in this film appears to be timeless as it appears humanity still insists on creating war instead of peaceful negotiations. White feathers are distributed to cowards, at least in 1880 England, but this movie might convince you who really should receive the feather, for bravery comes in many forms.  <br />
B00005JN2X|5.0|Collateral is one of the best thrillers I've seen in quite some time. The mood is dark and remorseless, presumably to accentuate and emphasize these same qualities in Vincent (Tom Cruise), a professional assassin who has chosen Max (Jaimie Foxx), an everyman character with a heart of gold and big dreams to chauffer him to his targets' homes/hangouts. All would go well for Vincent if Max would just drive the cab... but he doesn't. Revealing more of the plot would be doing this intelligent movie a great injustice, but let's just say that the movie is a real rollercoaster, varying in intensity and setting often, never losing us in what could have easily been a boring vehicle for A-list actors and directors to fill their time. Along the way, we learn much of both of these characters, whom director Michael Mann obviously cares a great deal for. Truly superb acting, storyline, directing, settings, music, tone, and mood make for a great movie that deserves awards and recognition as one of the best thrillers of the last decade.

B0002234LS|4.0|Interesting......with a bit of a twist to keep it so! <br /> <br />Johnny Depp plays a depressed writer living alone in a cabin while going through a divorce due to his wife's affair. Depp is very convincing as the loner in the wilderness, taking days to sleep and walking about in a tattered robe, while letting his hair go wild. His character is completely likable and throughout the film you somehow hope for a better existence for this down on his luck guy. He crosses paths with a few eerie characters played by John Turturro and Timothy Hutton, both actors effective in their individual roles as well.  <br /> <br />I was surprised to find out that this film is an adaptation of something Stephen King wrote because usually I find the King books un-complimented by their movie versions. However I found this film to be along the lines of something Hitchcock would have mastered. The story is interesting and the movie moves along most of the time without much effort. The great surprise for me was that I didn't have the film figured out in the end; I like movies with those kinds of mysterious secrets!   <br />
B0000UJL96|5.0|This is personally my favorite Star Trek film; it possesses an original story based on [at the time] current events, and for a trek film it is both intriguing and a bit spooky.  The film follows the (now functioning, post ST: V) Enterprise-A as they are sent to escort the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon to Earth, under the command of reluctant James T. Kirk, who detests the Klingon race for the cold murder of his son (as seen in ST: III).  En route to Earth, an incident occurs in which the Chancellor's ship is seemingly attacked by the Enterprise and the Chancellor is assassinated by disguised Starfleet crewmen.  Kirk and Dr. McCoy attempt to aid the dying Klingons, but they are arrested as assassins by Gorkon's chief-of-staff, General Chang.<br /><br />Kirk and McCoy are sentenced to the prison planet of Rura Penthe where they have several assassination attempts pitted against them.  Spock, meanwhile determines that several Federation, Romulan, and even Klingon members conspired together to murder the chancellor so that there would be no peace in the galaxy and each government could profit off war.  Kirk even realizes that he had held a grudge against peace due to the murder of his son.  The movie shows a great deal of conflict that has a great feeling of political pressure, analogous to the Cold War tensions.<br /><br />The Ups: The space battles are awesome; it's nice to see Sulu as captain of the Excelsior, considering he fell in love with that ship in ST: III; Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Chang is great; and the \\"crew's\\" acting, including Shatner's Kirk are all wonderful; Nick Meyer's direction is of course magnificent, as he had previously demonstrated his ability with ST: II; and Cliff Eidelman's score is incredible and it's eerieness completely compliments the mood of the film itself.<br /><br />The Downs: The Enterprise-A gets decommissioned, though it was just commissioned at the epilogue of ST: IV; I feel that there should have been more of a presence of the Romulans in the picture, and Chang's quoting of Shakespeare, at times, comes across as too much of a carbon copy of Khan quoting Melville in ST: II.resence of the Romulans in the picture, and Chang's quoting of Shakespeare, at times, comes across as too much of a carbon copy of Khan quoting Melville in ST: II.
0312995423|1.0|I quite enjoyed reading Dan Brown's Da Vinci code.  I found the whole cryptography/art history/chatolic church them quite fascinating.  But at the same time I felt my qualms about the the lack of development of characters and the unimaginative plot where overrun by the sheer volume of interesting data that was being used in the story.<br /><br />I decided to check out the author's previous works, Angels&Demons, Deception Point and now Digital Fortress.<br /><br />I have to say this - my initial qualms about this author came right out into the forefront.  He is a BAD, BAAAD writer.  Terrible characterization, plots from writer's workshop 101,wild-eyed misstatements of facts and hackneyed writing.<br /><br />I am done with Dan Brown.

078322737X|5.0|I grew up a few years later than the main characters in this movie, in a society in which millions of people were unlikely to agree about what life was all about, or whether anyone had the right to consider that a fair question.  Listening to the documentary on this DVD, I was reminded of how many people would end up being nobodies in my society, and that being in a movie like this, which was about as big a hit as anyone with less than a million dollar budget was likely to make even once, could be just a start for the people who would have the opportunity to do things like say something and have everybody hear it.<br /><br />If this movie was what being a teenager was all about, I missed my teen years completely, being even more of a geek than the geek character in this movie.  I was even taught by some serious adult people that I knew at church when I was a kid that the music that the teen characters in this movie listen to was lame.  It took me a long time to figure out how different most things are from whatever adults are thinking, and this is particularly true of some early rock songs that still sound good, even after they are no longer in the top ten.  I had to count songs in this movie to find about ten songs that are still really great, and some of those songs are used in 2004 for exercise classes at the YMCA in Saint Paul, Minnesota, if you really want to know what little old ladies listen to before they do can-can kicks in the swimming pool.  I was never a fanatic about cars, so that large element of this movie and the local cops were never a significant part of my life.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is that everything happens all at once.  The documentary on the DVD explains how many years it took to get this movie written (by George Lucas, Gloria Katz & Willard Huyck), cast, filmed, edited to be less than three hours long, and marketed for showing in theaters.  Most of the people making this movie were young, and have now been around so long that looking back so far makes them think they really were nobodies once.  Harrison Ford in the movie is the only character who plays a big shot and tells Toad `I'm not a nobody.'  The way the movie ends, he is just another loser, and even the guy who beat him can't see the sense of racing these nobodies.  Cindy Williams complains in the documentary about having such a sad part, while the other girls get to have fun, but being head cheerleader with one more year of high school to go is the top of the social heap at that level, and knowing what she wants, by the end of the movie she has latched on to something.<br /><br />I have often complained that entertainment values have become the main economic motivator of changes in American society.  While this movie is a nostalgia boom that won't let go of a teen culture still unaware of the changes that were going to hit American society after 1962, the success of the movie started a drive to reproduce elements of youth culture in forms that millions of people could relate to on a personal level, as a form of entertainment that is superior to the extreme themes and clear villains of myths that have an obvious message.  Consider the drunk Terry the Toad telling someone, `You are talking to the woman I love,' when she happens to be the first woman in the movie who would even go out with him.  This is an easy mistake for someone in Terry the Toad's position to make, and laughing at him hardly helps to make the situation any better, but it is so damn funny that it even makes Curt Henderson's best line, about wimps getting all of the snatch, sound a little lame.<br /><br />Three scenes that were deleted for the theatrical release of this movie have been restored in the film on videotape and DVD, and those scenes might be surprising for people who have not seen them before.  The documentary on the DVD explains which scenes were cut to save six minutes.  It didn't hurt the film much, but if you have not seen the long version, consider buying this DVD just so you can hear Terry the Toad telling a used car salesman, `For God's sake, leave me alone!'nsider buying this DVD just so you can hear Terry the Toad telling a used car salesman, `For God's sake, leave me alone!'
B00003CXCT|5.0|I can't believe people are getting so upset about the changes George is making to HIS movies - they're not ours, they never have been, and we have no right to dictate to him what he should or should not release. Personally, I jumped for joy when I read about these changes - an updated Jabba, better lightsaber effects, Ian McDiarmid in Episode V, and Hayden Christensen as Anakin - these changes tie the saga together as it should be. The prequels so far have been superb, and I believe Episode III will be the best Star Wars film of all. I will always be grateful to George Lucas for the joy he's given me with these movies, and seeing these changes, as well as the beautiful picture quality of the DVDs, is the best gift he could have given me. The Star Wars Trilogy is dead - long live the Star Wars Saga!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|For the most part, Lost in Translation was a very interesting romantic story about two people staying in the same hotel while in Tokyo. The secret to enjoying this movie is to make sure that you are in the right frame of mind while when you go to view this. There is a very laid back pace throughout the picture. <br /> <br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both did wonderful jobs. They needed to since the movie focuses so heavily on them. This was a very well thought out and carefully planned movie and it shows. This is definitely a movie to check out when you find yourself in that right frame of mind. <br />
B00005JMJ4|1.0|To be truthful, boring and insufferable. The Academy was asleep when it nominated this flick for awards, and dead on its feet to grant one. There is nothing likeable about the characters and Bill Murray is totally wasted as a has-been actor making a commercial in Japan. Johannsen is cardboard as the largely ignored wife of a hot photographer. Murray is rich and famous, but unhappy: well, he cheats on his wife! Johannssen, unlike many REALLY unhappy and abused wives could easily leave but doesn't. Sorry, Hollywood, people with REAL lives and REAL problems aren't going to be entertained by rich people who have it all but sit around complaining about how shallow their lives are. Rent Bill Murray's classic &quot;Stripes&quot; instead and have some real fun.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I have to say that this is her worst album- and this is from a die hard fan. I have all her albums- I have even worn out my first copies of Madonna, Like a Virgin, The Immacuate Collection and Music and had to replace them. I consider this woman a genius, and yes, I even like a lot of tracks on this album, hence the three star review. And her reinevtion tour is brilliant! But this? It's just? I think she wasted her time. <br />Track 1 is American Life (5/5) I wish there were some way we could see the original video. That would be really cool. <br />Track 2 is Hollywood. (3/5) I can't believe she released it as a single. She looks like Eva Peron on the coverm and the song isn't good. Track3 is I'm so Stupid (0/5) She was stupid to release it. Track 4 is Love Profusion, which she also relased as a single(3/5) It is very repetitive and I don't like the video <br />Track 5 is Nobody Knows Me (5/5) Some people think it's annoying but it was a B side I think for Love Profusion? And I liked it a lot. Track 6 is Nothing Fails (4/5) She released it as a single and it is a ballad dedicated I think to her husband/ Track 7 is intervention, which I think is dedicated to her son, and I am not going to rate it <br />Track 8 is X-Static Process, and I also give it a 0. <br />Track 9 is Mother and Father (5/5) I always enjoy hearing about Madonna's mother. Track 10 is Die Another Day (6/5)  And Track 11 is Easy Ride(2/5) <br /> <br />Overall Grade C- And I HATE to give a Madonna album that grade. Like I said I am A die hard Madonna fan, having WORN OUT some of my othre CDs from listening too much. Overall, save your money. Download American Life, Die Another Day and Nothing Fails and save your money and buy Immaculate Collection, Like a Prayer, Ray of Light, or Music which all contain NOTHING but GREAT songs from her!  I think I have worn out all of the aforementioned albums and have had to replace them. To read about them, go and see my reviews. Avoid this though, please. This andDick Tracy are her worst. If you are even more hardcore then me, please do not buy it new like I did. Buy it used. Buy my copy. I'm trying to sell it. DO NOT BUY IT NEW.
B000000WF0|5.0|FYI to Mr. Hayes. It's a British band. The Verve Pipe is a Michigan band. If you are gonna attempt to add tidbits of info to your review, make sure you get your facts straight first, mmk?<br /><br />The album starts off with Bittersweet Symphany, which remains one of the few songs I could put on permanent replay and never get tired of. Amazingly enough, the rest of the album manages to still hold it's own. Great lyrics, great imagery and soaring music.
B000005J08|3.0|The cover of this album is a man who has just been shot. Either by himself or another, it is not clear. Like the murder of this man, this music is violent, intriguing, but ultimately pointless. I have never met another person in the world that actually liked this guy besides myself. <br /> . <br /> HOWEVER, if you are interested in John Zorn (aka Masada, Naked City, Painkiller, etc) then there is nothing anyone can do to stop you until you have heard it, and why not? The thing is, John Zorn exists in a very weird place in music. He is halfway in the Jazz section and halfway in the pop section. Look in an indie record store if you don't believe me. He even sometimes makes it into the 20th century composers section along with Morton Feldman, John Cage and Philip Glass.  <br /> . <br /> Forget Harmony Korine, John Zorn is the original Ritalin kid. There are so many rhythm changes that your head will spin. My advice is this: if you are coming from mostly a classical/jazz background, you might want to start with \\"Duras: Duchamp&quot; or &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; (if you liked pop music back in the day) as your first experience. If you are coming form a mostly pop/rock background, this is the best album for you. Why the difference? Well, if you like angry-sounding music (like metal or hardcore punk) then this disk won't be completely alien to you. You'll start with the tracks that are more familiar in sound and work up to some of the more jazzy tracks like &quot;The Sicilian Clan&quot; which is also on &quot;The Big Gundown.&quot; I'm still not sure what I make of John Zorn.  <br /> . <br /> He's like Radiohead in a way. I only like listening to Radiohead when I've been dumped, and when I have just been dumped, Radiohead is the best album in the world...otherwise, Radiohead stays on the shelf. If I have been made manic by deadlines and work, then John Zorn is the only album that I want to listen to. But if you played this when I was sitting in a field looking at clouds(yeah, as if I have ever done that) then this album would likely just be a headache-inducing mess. Should you buy it? Well it's good music, but your world won't end if you don't have it. Then again, how many times has the world ever ended?  <br /> . <br /> Besides, why would you buy something you didn't like?
B00005JNEI|1.0|Of course Republicans could make a movie about the libs but we don't need to.  And believe me, there is plenty of stuff I can say about the liberal democRATS.  This is just propoganda and jibberish from a complete and total SLOB. <br /> <br />This movie is absolute RUBBISH!!!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the best film of 2004! Before I got any further, I must say that some amazon reviewers are idiots!!! These morons are giving this amazing film one star because of its lack of action? I mean, come on, Kill Bill Vol. 2 has so much to offer. It has great acting and an awesome plot.  What more can anyone ask for? If people are giving this film one star for its lack of action, they are simply idiots! There is so much more to a movie than just action. If you guys want to see non stop action, then go check out a Jet Li film or something.  Anyhow, I thought Kill Bill Vol. 2 was a lot better than the first.  It had a better ending and the story felt more complete. So go out and get the film when it comes out!
6302878527|5.0|I read in Danny Peary's \\"A Guide for the Film Fanatic\\" that some people have formed a strong emotional attachment to this 1967 film. I am one of them.  From the opening notes of Henry Mancini's evocative score (personally I think it's his best work) to the end where the main characters drive off into Italy after some verbal sparring, this movie still provides the same pleasure it did when I first saw it on TV in the early seventies. \\"Two for the Road\\" is a time capsule of Carnaby Street fashion and French new wave scene juxtaposition, but it remains timeless in its emotionally piercing view of marriage and in the beguiling presence of Audrey Hepburn.  There will unlikely be an actress with more style or grace on screen, and never has she seemed more sexy, playful or innately human. It's a shame she never played a role as rich in texture as Frederic Raphael's script provides here. His dialogue is sharp and insightful, as he has the main characters often repeat one another for the sake of getting a different meaning from the same line of dialogue.<br /><br />As Joanna and Mark Wallace, Hepburn and Albert Finney get to live out more than a decade in their characters' lives from initial meeting to near-divorce. What makes the evolution more impressive is that the story is not a linear narrative but rather a series of five road trips that volley the viewer back and forth in the relationship. Finney provides a formidable match for Hepburn, and he plays with the right mix of roguish insouciance and insecure ambition that doesn't make his character always likeable but certainly believable.  Their chemistry is palpable, especially in the early days of their courtship as the movie makes hitchhiking the most romantic of adventures with the couple cutting through the entirety of France in various vehicles in record time. Only in the movies. The episode with the pretentious American tourist couple and their bratty daughter provides some biting and funny moments...ironically, the actress portraying the wife, Eleanor Bron, is British. Not surprising that this movie was not such a huge hit stateside since the four Americans in the movie are portrayed in such an unflattering light.<br /><br />Regardless, credit needs to go to director Stanley Donen (himself an American), who somehow pulls all these disparate elements together and uses his extensive Hollywood experience to bring a nice glossy sheen to the whole film. His third collaboration with Hepburn (after \\"Funny Face\\" and \\"Charade\\") really turns into a tribute to her as she makes a remarkable transformation from naïve choirgirl to jaded jet-set housewife that goes well beyond the changing hairstyles and clothing. This is one to treasure.<br /><br />**ADDENDUM ABOUT THE DVD RELEASE POSTED ON NOVEMBER 17, 2005**<br /><br />At last!...This wondrous film has been lovingly restored for its much-delayed DVD release. The print quality has been significantly improved over the VHS tape I've had for over a decade. A nice bonus feature is a split-screen before-and-after short that shows the visual improvement. Best of all, there is finally an audio commentary track to accompany the film, and Donen provides illuminating insight on the elliptical narrative structure and the non-chronological juxtaposition of the scenes. He explains that the characters are reliving their memories by association with the feelings they are having in the present. His adoration of Hepburn is pervasive and understandable, as he claims rightfully that this was her best performance (they worked together three times). I just wish Finney was available to add his perspective. Moreover, if you ever wondered why the young Jacqueline Bisset's voice doesn't sound like her at all, he admits she was re-dubbed by another actress due to the blaring noise of generators during the location shooting. She apparently had already moved on to shoot her first Hollywood film. For those like me who adore this film, the DVD is a must-buy.portraying the wife, Eleanor Bron, is British.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|Just when you thought as bad as it could get was seeing naked pasty white Neo doing the dirty with Trinity while shots of the fat people doing the naked rave party dance scene... ENTER MATRIX 3!  It almost fools one into thinking it is not going to be bad... and then boom.  The end comes and you are left with the biggest 'wtf' since the end of The Red Planet. <br /> <br />Don't buy this movie, pool your cash together with all the others who bought the first two movies and hire someone to give the creators a nuclear wedgie. :P
0385335482|5.0|This is the first book in a great series.  S. Kinsella is able to convey B. Bloomwood into an actual person (through the up and the downs).  The book is one of those books that you hate to put down and are bummed when it's done.  The series only gets better as Bloomwood grows in Kinsella's mind.  It's great to see that Bloomwood doesn't stay the same, that throughout the series her life changes.  Sometimes good sometimes bad, but always with humor.  I can't wait for Kinsella's new book A Shopaholic and Sister to be release in Sept.
0345457684|1.0|Who edited this garbage mascerading as a book? \\"Altered Carbon\\" has to be the worst book I've ever read. By the time you are 10 pages in you want to throw the book across the room. By the time you are on page 100 you woner how you can get 2 hours of your life back. This is the only book I've never finished! Don't believe the hype skip this awful book.
B000002H6C|5.0|Well here it is...metallica's peak. Everything from kill em all until this has gotten better...but this is where it stops. I'm not saying I dont' like black album and later...I think they all are MASTERPIECES! But this is the BEST metallica album.<BR>A lot of things are happening here...Cliff Burton passed away...so this is the first studio album with the new bass player...Jason Newsted. I don't mind jason... but cliff was 100x better. You can't even hear jason's playin in this album (the production SUCKS!).<br />1)Blackened - I love this song. Fast...the main riff is killer, and lars' double bass is wicked too. 10/10<br />2)...and justice for all - i (personally) love this song. Most people say it droans on too long. Kirk hammett (lead guitar) said that they won't play it live anymore because they saw too many people in the crowd yawning. so that explains it. 9/10<br />3)Eye of the Beholder - I don't much care for the intro...but it gets better. not bad. 8.5/10<br />4)ONE - Metallica classic. If it wasn't for this song there wouldn't be a metallica now. One brought them to fame as they released their first music video. This song is incredible...lars really pulls it off in the interlude...and kirk blew me away with that crazy solo. The lyric's are VERY powerful. 11/10<br />5)Shortest Straw - Cool song, the lyric's are about Cliff's death. Stong lyrics good solo...- 8.5/10<br />6)Harvester of Sorrow - Cool song, I love the intro...the main riff is fun to play on guitar...over all good - 9/10<br />7)Frayed Ends of Sanity - Stupid intro..but the rest gets better. - 8.75/10<br />8)To live is to Die - Instrumental. Incredible. THis is the last song that cliff burton wrote before  he passed away. I love this song. IT's just great. - 10/10<br />9)Dyers Eve - WOA! Lars' kicks ass on this song...the double bass is soo fast i've never heard anything like it. THe lyric's are strong...fast...overall greatness. 10/10<br />I love this album...kirk pulled off some of the greatestsolos ever, lars's drumming is at the top of it's class...james' lyrics are outstanding...and jason's bass...well you couldn't really hear it lol. The songs are amazing...<BR>BUY THIS ALBUM
B000021YQV|5.0|Once again they seem to go beyond what I expected. There first cd was the best ever and this was really close to beating it. SOAD is probably one of my top 3 groups that I like. If you are a fan of heavy, rock, music this cd is for you. Not as vulgar as the first. This cd really made out well in 2001 and 2002. They got there songs Science and Shimmy on two video games. The best music video in the world is Aerials and that song is featured on this cd. The songs Toxicity and Chop Suey also had great videos made for them. Some people say Serj's vocals are bad but I think there awesome. The drummer and guitarist are also great. I like how they start off there songs. It kind of starts off soft then gets really heavy.     If you can find the limited edition version of this cd with a dvd featuring 3 live tracks and a toxicity video, get it.     RATINGS:  1.Prison Song-(3:21)-10/10  2.Needles-(2:13)-10/10  3.Deer Dance-(2:54)-9/10  4.Jet Pilot-(2:06)-9/10  5.X-(1:58)-10/10  6.Chop Suey-(3:30)-10/10  7.Bounce-(1:54)-10/10  8.Forest-(4:00)-9/10  9.ATWA-(2:56)-10/10  10.Science-(2:42)-10/10  11.Shimmy-(1:50)-10/10  12.Toxicity-(3:38)-10/10  13.Psycho-(3:45)-9/10  14.Aerials-(6:11)-10/10    Rumours of a new System of a Down cd coming out in November of 2004.

0385504209|4.0|After over a year on the national bestseller lists I finally decided to read it.  I was surprised to find that the novel was not only a well written mystery but contained some of the most intriguing thoughts on Christian doctrine that I've come across to date.  While the novel's interpretation of religious symbolism and history has caused a flutter of derogatory commentary and reviews from some, there are many who can appreciate the storyline from a purely novelistic perspective:  it's great material that generates a lot of interest from readers, it's fiction and therefore has some truthful elements and many imaginary ones.  I won't bother with a plot description and character analysis with this review; there are many other reviews here that provide that information.  What I will say is that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a worthwhile read that motivated me to read a bit more about the historical aspects covered in the text.  Brown's writing is crisp, economical and easily accessible.  My curiosity was heightened and my perspective expanded all while being thoroughly entertained.  No need to highly recommend this one, the readership already has.  I suspect this novel will be a bestseller for quite a while.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I am not even going to go into detail on the number of historical inaccuracies of the film. The briefing; the plot behind the name; is nothing more than the typical - i.e. two drop-dead manly flyboys fall for a makeup encrusted portrait of a nurse, thus forming a love triangle...and so it goes. The  film dishonors the men who fought and died at Pearl. There appears to be no overall theme, the characters are cardboard, the plot is shallow, Pearl Harbor has practically been thrown in just so that the directors had something to blow up, and historical accuracy totally flunks out. Had the film really focused on Pearl Harbor, something might have been achieved. But because it had to be written and aimed at the typical teenage audience, it fails miserably.
B0000029AL|5.0|I actually own this album on LP, and I absolutely love it. I am not a fan of Aerosmith, but I bought the LP because \\"Dream On\\" was on it, and I ended up adoring the entire album. Every track is a winner, in my opinion, and if Aerosmith had not strayed from their blues roots and gone mainstream-rock, I would count myself one of their fans based on this album alone (that's saying a lot, I know). But then again, I'm a blues afficionado. So if you like great blues-rock, get this album. If you like \\"Dude (looks like a Lady)\\", you may not like this one.
B0002KVULG|4.0|Odd how this 1979 little gem of a \\"different take\\" on \\"Dracula\\", based on Frank Langella's Broadway version, was fairly well-reviewed when it was first released, and considered a handsome and sumptuous updating of the old Bram Stoker chestnut, only this time with a mesmerizingly charismatic Count, with lush locations and costars like Laurence Olivier and Kate Nelligan.<br /><br />Perhaps it wasn't perfect (they get Mina and Lucy, for one thing, mixed up--- but then, how many filmed \\"Dracula\\" versions are all THAT faithful to the book?!?) but it had a melancholy mood and texture that was quite absorbing and did quite well, justly, in '79.<br /><br />It also became a top horror video rental in the '80s.<br /><br />Today, it's reputation has fallen from 'good' to 'mediocre' to 'huh?'<br /><br />It's been said that Langella's stage performance \\"gets lost\\" amongst \\"trendy special effects\\", and I have to confess that I never saw Langella do the Count on stage [I understand he turned taking-off his cape into an artform], but anybody who can virtually wipe even Olivier off the screen as Langella does in the movie can't have had ALL of his stage-presence removed in the film!<br />And as for \\"trendy special effects\\"? The \\"effects\\" are subject-appropriate; nothing excessive. Good job of directing by John Badham, and music score by John Williams.<br /><br />Of course, I've yet to see the DVD quality-- hope it's good.<br /><br />UPDATE 3 MONTHS LATER AFTER POSTING THE ABOVE REVIEW (8/04)....  Well, guess what?--- it's NOT good (the DVD). I just got mine and what should I find? It's virtually now in black-and-white. And guess what else? Director John Badham did this DELIBERATELY for the DVD release. In the DVD commentary for the film, Badham states that they couldn't \\"drain\\" the color out of the film to his satisfaction in 1979, for mood purposes, so now he can [and DID] for the DVD.<br /><br />The problem is: the movie didn't NEED this \\"improvement\\". The original photography (now completely counteracted on the DVD) was rich and atmospheric and, as it was shot in England so artfully, it had been dreary and drab in all the right spots--- but SOME scenes, expecially the low-lit interior moments [like the candlelight dinner between Langella and Kate Nelligan] had been wonderfully warm as an effective \\"counter\\".... Well, not no more, Drac-fans... The skins tones are gone, anything once orange is now dull white...<br /><br />The DVD has been ruined, and on Badham's misguided orders...<br /><br />There's even that one scene by the cemetery between Langella, Lord Olivier and Miss Nelligan at sunset--- and during the commentary, Badham talks about how the actors and crew had to wait all day in order to get just the right natural light, and that \\"today\\" they'd just put in the sunset with computers... But Badham's stating this as you watch the scene with the sunset now REMOVED by computers, 'specially for DVD! The pink stripe across the sky they waited for hours to get is no more! It could be just another foggy noon in England-- in which case, the Count should be in bed... And after seeing this travesty, so should I.<br /><br />I feel SOOO ripped-off... Why do directors go back, so many years later after they've lost all objectivity, and \\"fix\\" good movies they got right to begin with ('cause aint nobody fixin' the BAD ones!)?<br /><br />One last knife-turn: during the closing credits, Badham states he now wishes he could re-edit the film and speed it up \\"so it kicks ass\\".... [long eye roll on my part here] Terrific. So then it'll be yet another shrill, frenetic, off-paced piece of incoherent tripe we're getting in the theaters today, where you can't even follow the plot and the \\"mood\\" is non-existent because everything is screaming at you at mach-speed without relent.<br /><br />Only Mr. Badham would apparently also do so in virtual black-and-white, which is now the approximate color-scheme the \\"Dracula\\" DVD.<br /><br />Thanks, Mr. Badham... It's yours to destroy.rs to destroy.
0375432302|3.0|All the ideas, theories and opinions written by Dan Brown in &quot;The Davinci Code&quot; (Mary Magdelene, Jesus, Opus Dei, femininity being crushed by the church) are issues i've been hearing about since eighth grade religion and history classes.<br /><br /> I've developed my opinion that even though the church *today* is a perfectly harmless corporation, a few hundred--even just fifty years ago it was a suffocating force preciding over human kind to own guilt and punishment just for being alive, which to me is disgusting. (I won't even go into how the church has treated women)<br /><br /> Its nothing new, yet Dan Brown has managed to put it all into a work of fiction to appeal to the masses. Personally, I agree with all of the theories but thats *not important* when it comes to reviewing this book.<br /><br /> The writing is nothing more than ordinary, and I dare say i'd have appreciated him just jotting all his theories down in document form rather than a hocking work of fiction.<br /><br /> The first chapter was well done but by the middle of the book I was bored, confused and aggrivated by his writing style--'and then, and then he smiled, and then she did this, and then they did that...' and dan Brown's obsession with naming &quot;Harvard&quot; every few pages made my eyes roll back into my head.<br /><br /> Saying that, however, my interest was kept piqued throughout the novel, and I managed to finish it, no more knowledgeable then I was before but definately enlightened. If only Donna Tartt had written this.
0446677450|5.0|I first heard about Robert Kiyosaki from a friend at work. Mr. Kiyosaki was coming to our area and would be conducting a Rich Dad seminar but I really didn't want to lay out the bucks. <br /> <br />Sometime later, I saw Robert Kiyosaki's infomercial and my interest was piqued. Still, I usually don't order from informercials and have always been suspicious of these late nite promoters. <br /> <br />I found out that our local library had Rich Dad Poor Dad (call me El Cheapo!) and requested it. Found out that there was a long waiting list and that all 50 copies were out. After about a week and half, the library mailed me a copy and I went to work reading this tome. <br /> <br />At first, I was a little dissappointed. The book seemed almost like it was written for children. Hey, I have an MBA. This was beneath me, or so I thought. <br /> <br />But the more I read, the more I found what Kiyosaki was saying applied to me. I felt like he was talking directly to me. <br /> <br />I too had been bred with a lot of old wives tales about how to make money and create wealth. I thought that education was the be all and end all. And I still believe it is...just not traditional education. As I said, I have an MBA and I can truthfully say that all that MBA got me was a job for awhile unntill I got downsized. Then another job and downsized again. Then another job and well, you get the message. <br /> <br />So I read Rich Dad Poor Dad. I began to realize that my mortgage, even though it was 75% paid off was not an asset, but a liability. I also knew that a job was doing nothing for me but helping my employer get rich off of me untill they didn't need me anymore. <br /> <br />I have to admit, it wasn't easy letting go of my prior false programming. Untill I realized how much money it was costing me. <br /> <br />Rich Dad Poor Dad impressed me so much that I wanted to keep it so I went out and bought my own copy. I also bought CashFlow Quadrant and Rich Dads Guide to Investing. After seeing that informercial again, I went ahead and ordered the home study course as well. I was tired of corporate America playing games with me, my family and my wealth. <br /> <br />The first thing I did was change my philosophy. I went from the E Quadrant to the I Quadrant. I used my home equity to buy rental properties and notes and created immediate cash flow. Now I was in control of my life. <br /> <br />I am grateful to my friend who I used to work with for introducing me to Robert Kiyosaki and the Rich Dad way. And I encourage everyone to at least check him out. If you are really skeptical and an El Cheapo like I was, at least check it out at your local library.  <br /> <br />Judging by the recent unemployment numbers, even though we have had 13 months of job growth and are headed in the \\"right direction\\" for those who want a job, it is so painfully obvious that people are NOT happy with the job market and all the more reason to follow Robert Kiyosaki's methods. My experience is that all a job does is leave you Just Over Broke. You are essentially exploited and are making your employer rich. Employers pay you what they have to to keep you and they only keep you as long as they have to. You are never paid what you are worth, unless you work for yourself. <br /> <br />Thank you Brad for telling me about Robert Kiyosaki and thank you Robert Kiyosaki for a powerful wealth building system! <br /> <br />
B00005JN2X|4.0|4/5 <br /> <br />The premise sounds pretty dull, doesn't it?  Tom Cruise plays a hit man who coerces a cab driver to drive him around LA to knock off five people.  Jamie Foxx portrays the reluctant cab driver.  Director Michael Mann proves that a compelling drama doesn't require an excess in plot, car chases or violence or humour.  Much of the film takes place in the cab with Cruise and Foxx exchanging philosophies of life, goals and dreams.  Foxx, a cabbie for 12 years, wants to save up to open a limo service.  Cruise is more enigmatic about his past, but instead is a relentless, cold-blooded assassin.  Still, he's not one-dimensional at all. <br /> <br />Cruise is excellent as the laser-focused killer with taste.  Witness the scene in the jazz club to see how good his taste in music is.  He's not cocky like the mastermind bad guy in the first Die Hard, but he is cool, confident and obviously emotionally detached from his victims.  He doesn't care who they are since he's just doing his job.  He also doesn't flash the million-dollar Cruise movie star smile. <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx also performs well as the uncomfortable cabbie counterpoint to the Cruise character.  He's just your average joe hoping to get ahead in life but obviously taking a long time to get there, just like most people. <br /> <br /> <br />What's refreshing about this film is that it doesn't scatter the character development over too many players.  The lack of comedic lines also reinforces the grittiness of the script.  Michael Mann has produced a mostly believable thriller, that makes the competition look like cartoons for adults.   <br /> <br />Sure, there are stretches in the storyline but so long as you're prepared to gloss over them, this is a fine film.  Collateral is also much better than Cruise's last film, the pretensioulsy bloated The Last Samurai. Anyone looking for a non-stop action film or a \\"Lethal Weapon\\"-type film should look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Review by Triniman. <br />
B000002KIE|5.0|I just wanted to write a review to tell something to all those (...) kids who think they know what its all about. The Sex Pistols werent a band that was put together by the manager. Steve and Glenn and Paul all played together, and they recruited Johnny. Sid later joined the band cos they all hated Glenn. Not because he was better looking. He actually could play the bass contrary to what some people say. Also he wasnt just randomly picked, he was friends with john. They wrote their own songs. If you look at the inside of the booklet it tells you so. If you read \\"Rotten : No Irish no blacks no dogs\\" it tells about the practices where they wrote them. Also, it doesnt matter what record label you're on as long as your making music YOU like. Most of you who gave this under 3 stars are full of sh*t and obviously dont know your facts. Dont say sh*t you dont even know for sure. Do some research. I dont know what blah blah blah even is thinking. The sex pistols didnt sell out. People like music, and there are always gonna be posers, so dont blame that on the band. Especially the band that practically created the genre you say they ruined. (...)
B00005JN2X|4.0|Cruise saved us from last years dull movie season with The Last Samurai. This year, he is back to save us again with Collateral.<br /><br />Collateral is a very intelligent, yet simple action movie. Tom Cruise plays a cool hitman named Vincent. This is one of Cruise's best characters ever. If you enjoy dumb muscle bound, Vin Disel type badguys you might not fully appreciate the movie. If you enjoy a smooth talking, Charismatic, Clint eastwood style badguy then you will love this movie..<br /><br />Jamie Foxx's character isn't very exciting. He plays, well.... just your average guy(who works as a taxi driver). Ahh, but that's just what we need! When Foxx's average guy character gets taken along for a wild ride with Vincent(Cruise), we feel like we are taken along too(because we can relate to Foxx). Jamie Foxx did an excellent job with this difficult role. Playing a regular guy in a crazy situation, that movie watchers are constantly asking \\"would I react like that, if I were in this situation\\", is a hard role.<br /><br />Casting=5 stars<br /><br />ending=3.5 stars<br /><br />Directing=4.5 stars<br /><br />plot & storyline=4 stars<br /><br />replay value=4 stars<br /><br />OVERALL= 4.2 TOTAL STARS<br /><br />The last 2 years of American movies have been a bit dull. If you need a fun escape, then take a ride with Foxx and Cruise in Collateral...
B000001IPL|4.0|Smash was the last great Offspring album. Everything after I highly advise you stay away from. Ixnay had a few shining moments (like the &quot;Genocide&quot; rip-off &quot;Change the World&quot;), but they're too far and in-between. Smash is the last solid, consistently good release they put out. My favorite tracks (&quot;Killboy Powerhead&quot;, &quot;Not the One&quot;, and &quot;Genocide&quot;) make it clear that there were still remnants of Ignition and their eponymous debut on Smash. But that doesn't mean I'm going to lie and say I didn't love their big radio-hit &quot;Self-Esteem&quot; just as much as anyone else. I see that others have commented that it's too &quot;commercial&quot; for their &quot;tastes&quot;, but why care when it's one of the strongest songs of the band's career? I don't have a problem with good songs that become popular as long as they are worth all the airplay they get. &quot;Self-Esteem&quot; was definitely worth all its airplay. However, I do have a problem all the new Offspring songs (1998-present) on the radio. To be frank, their new songs suck and waste valuable airtime. Those embarrassing songs need to be replaced by songs from a band that is worth listening to and has something worthwhile to say. The Offspring have become so juvenile that it's hard to believe it's the same band that once sung out about the LAPD's abuse of power, American soldiers' abuse of power, and even the president's abuse of power. At least I still have Smash to remind me that The Offspring once had valuable, worthwhile ideas and songs. <br />  <br /> Four stars out of five
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When I heard this CD for the first time only about 7 of the tracks really impressed me. However, as I listened to them more and more the others grew on me equally and it truly is a great, eclectic CD. The only track on the CD that I do no care for much is &quot;The Hook Up&quot;. So many of Britney's facets are revealed on this CD. There are tons of different sounds, cool lyrics, and her voice adds character to each song. Overall it is one of the best albums of the year in all honesty.
B00005MJ13|5.0|Ferenc Fricsay's old recording of the Dvorak \\"New World\\" Symphony is about as individual as you can get in this music. It is also about as good as you can get, in my opinion. Not everyone feels this way, of course.<br /><br />Third Ear, a fine publication that suffers from having only one person review a composer or a large slice of his music, dissed this CD. Steven Ritter, one of American Record Guide's stable of reviewers, grouped this CD with recordings by Marriner, Eschenbach, Tennstedt, Klemperer and Slatkin that he said, \\"...may safely be dismissed on musical or sonic grounds.\\"<br /><br />This is to say, I suppose, that this critic can only accept the music a certain way, for everything musical and sonic about this recording -- especially in its newest reincarnation -- is satisfactory. The recording always sounded good and it is splendid in the new rendering. Since its release in 1962, the performance has been on many crtiics short list of the very best renderings of the New World Symphony. The add-ons in the current recording -- Smetana's \\"The Moldau\\" and Liszt's \\"Les Preludes\\" -- are exceptionally well done by Maestro Fricsay (apparently pronounced Free-shoy much as I'd like to say FREEK-sigh).<br /><br />Fricsay's way with symphonic staples was similar to others in his day. I'll never forget his recording of the Beethoven Symphony 7, which took a deliberate pace throughout until the closing pages, where he picked up the pace and completely turned around the musical experience.<br /><br />In romantic music he tended to add a lot of syrup to what was already pretty thick, and he did that with this music as well. Phrases often begin slowly and build dramatically, with a burst of ongoing romantic sensibility that can seem overwrought. I think this approach works fine in the music although I agree with those who say it varies from score markings. Indeed, it is what separates his recordings from all others.<br /><br />I have a co-worker that loves the music who told me his current favorite recordings was by the New York Philharmonic and Kurt Masur. This is a recording that has received plentiful critical acclaim over the years. I burned a copy of the Friscay recording and gave it to him. His verdict: \\"I think this is the best performance of this symphony I've ever heard.\\" If you buy this CD, you will say that too.as by the New York Philharmonic and Kurt Masur.

B00005JN2X|5.0|\\"Collateral\\" is a beautiful film: vibrating with gorgeous digital-clear shots of Los Angeles from Pico-Union and Downtown to Hollywood and Koreatown. And like director Michael Mann's previous \\"Heat,\\" \\"Collateral\\" is a visual tribute to Los Angeles. But \\"Collateral\\" is also a tribute to the acting talent of Tom Cruise who doesn't seem to get all the credit he is due: for example his excellent work in \\"Samurai\\" went virtually un-noticed last year.<br /><br />As Vincent, a cold blooded hit man, Cruise shows us once again that he can not only look good on screen, he can play a role completely against type and succeed admirably: his Vincent is cold, calculating, resolutely committed and totally focused on completing his task. Cruise's Vincent is a professional assassin: he kills for money because it is his job and is probably unsuited to much else; yet at the same time he revels in the hunt and the catch: enjoying it, feeling no remorse at all.<br /><br />Along the way he enlists/coerces/forces the help of a cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) who resists but ultimately adopts some of Vincent's amoral characteristics. Max becomes Vincent's unwitting disciple and his avenging angel.<br /><br />Michael Mann has directed with a keen eye and a jaundiced view of what makes Los Angeles, Los Angeles:  the City of the Angels, the final frontier of last chances, every inch the Wild Wild West where everything is cool as long as you wear the right clothes, have the right haircut and drive the hottest car.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|As you have already read by now, this movie is about 4 people whose lives spin out of control due to destructive lives and drugs.  The mother's story is in my opinion the most shocking, becuase her doctor basically got her addicted to speed-like diet pills that eventually drive her over the edge.  Every person in this film gradually succumbs to madness and addiction, and its done in such an amazing matter even you find yourself shocked when all of a sudden they all turn into junkies before your eyes and the change was so graduall you didnt even notice it.  With the use of tripped-out scenes, inovative and original camera angles and shots, amazing actors, brilliant directing, and a nervracking use of the last 20 minutes, youll not only be left shocked and amazed, you'll find yourself feeling like youre literally on a roller coaster.  Ive never seen any movies that had me saying 'oh my god' out loud and that could keep me so on edge for almost half an hour, but this movie did.    And this isnt a sleazy film that makes the characters look like evil degenrates like most do, but it makes you sympasize with them becuase of the horrible things the drugs do to them.  Easyily the most shocking and nervracking films ive ever seen.  And has probably one of the best movie endings  ever.
B000002H2H|5.0|this is by far the best cd metallica has ever produced.  This album has everything a metal fan could want, insanly heavy tracks like \\"fight fire with fire\\" and \\"creeping death\\" and even a melodic (but still heavy) track like \\"fade to black\\".  I recommend this cd to any hardcore metal fan.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX was a great PPV. Aside from the evening gown match, the two fatal-fourway tag title matches & the disapointing Cruiserweight open (which was booked poorly, wasn't given enough time, and failed to really get the crowd into it), all the matches were three stars or more. The highlight of the night comes at the end, when Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero embrace in the centre of the ring. Like I said, it's a great PPV. <br /> <br />But the best reason to buy this is for the extras. They really, really went out of their way to include as much cool stuff as possible. <br /> <br />The highlight is definitely The Mania Of Wrestlemania, a candid documentary filmed at Wrestlemania 19, which mainly focuses on Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar, and Steve Austin vs. The Rock, but also includes deleted scenes on Triple H vs. Booker T & Vince McMahon vs. Hulk Hogan. This documentary is worth the price of the DVD alone. To hear Steve Austin get emotional, to see Hulk Hogan requiring acupuncture on his back before he can wrestle, to watch as Brock Lesnar freak out backstage after infamously botching the Shooting Star Press and knocking himself silly... a true fan needs to see this. <br /> <br />Other features on the WM XX DVD include pre- and post- match interviews conducted specifically for the DVD, a special called Wrestlemania's Ten Greatest Matches, hosted by Ric Flair, and the Dudley Boyz vs. Lance Storm & Val Venis for a tag team title shot from Heat weeks before, among others. <br /> <br />This is a must-have.
6305075492|1.0|The story is told in a very simplistic manner and the pace is sluggish.  The hammy, melodramatic acting really dates the film and causes what was once a horror film to seem comedic.  The one high mark is that the twist ending actually surprised and impressed me.
B00005JNEI|4.0|It seems the rightists, with their pretentious parroting of the same phrases, continue to go to the extreme. <br /> <br />Journalism? No, this film is a documentary, and as always, presents the filmmaker's perspective. A documentary is always slanted so, presenting its subject as the creator sees it. For example, a documentary about a charity might present it as needy, effective, misguided, or, perhaps, even futile - presented as the documentatian sees it and wishes to present it. In other words: his/her opinion, using supporting facts. It is important to note that documentaries are NOT scientific research. <br /> <br />Certainly the speculation (of course not facts) of what may have been in the President's mind at that school on 9/11 were the authors opinion; however, the President's words, as recorded, were his own. <br /> <br />Some have said this film was \\"lies\\", but obviously those writers had either not seen the film, or else they do not know what the word \\"lie\\" means. It is obvious to any observer that Moore's opinions (and those of others in the film) were merely opinions, not facts. But then the right does has trouble distinguishing between fact and interpretations thereof, as can be seen on Fox News. <br /> <br />One writer commented that Moore is a \\"great filmmaker\\". I suppose this is to imply fairness on that writer's part. In my OPINION, while Moore is intelligent, cares about people & fairness, is a strong opponent to neo-facsism, an excellent investigative documentarian, and an all-around decent guy, he is not - again, my opinion - a \\"great\\" filmmaker.  Whatever his ego may be privately, Moore is unlikely to classify himself as a peer to Fellini, Bergman, Almodovar, etc. <br /> <br />For eaxmple: I thought there was actually one film here that should have been two. The first half was clever, witty, funny. The second half was quite serious & sad. But given the scope of the material & subject matter, I don't know what Moore might have done otherwise. Istrongly recommend the movie, whether one agrees or not. What it presents is certainly worth pondering.
B00006JDSI|1.0|A renowned and influential work of movie history that manages to tell the story of Dracula at a sufficiently vibrant pace.  Since the story has been done so many times since, it is entirely predictable to the modern viewer, and the melodramatic pantomime of the day causes what was once a very frightening film to seem rather comical.
0375422307|5.0|Outstanding memoire. Eagerly awaiting sequel due out this month- August. Really makes one stop and think as one get's caught up in the life of this family.
B00004RYO4|3.0|The story is simple yet entertains throughout, from the discovery of the primitive tribe of Skull Island that worships Kong, to the kidnapping of beautiful Faye Wray, to the many perils faced by the men who are pursuing the great ape through the jungle, and finally to Kongs destructive rampage through New York City.  The final scenes atop the empire state building are awesome with the city spread out below and the camera taking the point-of-view of the biplanes zooming towards the giant ape.  Truly astounding special effects for such an old movie.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|It started out good and by the end of it, you keep looking at your watch, waiting for it to be over.
B000002J0B|3.0|It gets three, because it's still Zep, but Plant lacks powere (or doesn't muster it) here, and the keyboards are becoming too prominent. Jimmy Page is a God. That is all.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink is one of my favorite punk bands and they probably will be for a long time. i think they're awesome. thats why i bought this cd. of all of their music, i think this is the best of all. i will review each song and rate it on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br />dumpweed: tom does a good job at singing this song. the song is really fun to listen to. they just need to play a larger variety of chords. 9/10 <br /> <br />don't leave me: one of my favorite songs on the cd. its good to listen to at a party. i like travis's drumming in the song (you should see him in their concerts). 9.5/10 <br /> <br />aliens exist: the very beginning sounds good but then it completely changes. its a good song. tom sounds like a little kid singing this song. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />going away to college: the beginning of this song sounds weird but  then it starts to sound really good. the lyrics are pretty good surprisingly. it is a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />what's my age again?: this is a really funny song about being too immature for your age. at the very end there is a sequence where there is no singing that sounds really good and the part before it is good where mark has a harmony with himself is good too. 10/10 <br /> <br />dysentary gary: the guitar in the song sounds really good in the beginning of the song. mark has a part in the song where its just him that i like a lot. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />adam's song: this song sounds very depressing from the very beginning where there isn't any singing. if this song is to keep you from commiting suicide then its doing a bad job. it made me cry the first time. its depressing. wahhhhhhhhhhhh! 8.7/10 <br /> <br />all the small things: i love this song. if i could give it an eleven i would. the guitar and bass are awesome in this song. even my parents approve of it. i like to listen to it over and over. this was the first blink song i ever heard and it hooked me. 10/10 <br /> <br />the party song: mark does this song very very fast. i don't knowhow he did it. he takes like one breath the whole song. it even sounds like he's running out of breath. it sounds real good though. took me a long time to figure out what he was saying (think sean paul). 9.5/10 <br /> <br />mutt: the music itself sounds a little out of the ordinary but it goes perfectly with tom's singing. somehow if you take two weird things you get something thats pretty good. go figure. its not my favorite but its a good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />wendy clear: i like the melody in the song. i also like mark's singing but the lyrics are stupid. i don't care though. it sounds like he wants to be the miss america of teenagers. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />anthem: this song is really funny. especially the weird guy humpin the dog. i like the fast pace of the song. i don't know why they used this song to end the cd. its really good. i don't know why he sez that he's a time bomb but its sounds good so i didn't care. 10/10 <br /> <br />they matured a little in this album but blink still kept their image of immaturity pretty strong.
B00000AFDW|2.0|I don't think anbody in the world was looking more forward to this than me. The songs are hackneyed, with no real hooks or standouts. Can hardly hear Gene on bass - Performances by Ace and Paul's vocals sound good, but it's like a great actor with a bad script. The acting doesn't save it.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|It could have used a battle somewhere in the middle but the one at the beginning and end are realistic and well done.  The story is about friendship, honor, and duty.  There is alot of dramatic things such as when the man gets knocked overboard during the well done storm sequence, the man drowning himself with a cannonball as a weight, and the 2 main characters playin music together and fighting over right and wrong.  Overall its a good war drama, with good action, performances, drama, cinematography, and visuals.  I give it a 8 out of a 10 because it needs a battle in the middle to help quicken the pace a little to make it more watchable but everything else is good entertainment.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm sure that the people who say that this movie is full of lies probably don't know this FACT.  They just listen to hate mongers like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and don't bother doing the simplest of research on the internet that any child is capable of. Go to his website for a line by line affirmation of Moore's running commentary with sources listed.  It was combed through by fact checkers for New Yorker Magazine and by three lawyers.  It is legally true which means it is well within the bounds of Fox News and CNN.   <br />  Oh, by the way it's an excellent film, with many clips that you won't see elsewhere.  There is footage of the news, of government documents, of average folks, and in Iraq.  The occasional tastefully placed humor and tear-jerking moments really round out this excellent movie.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I personally think Vol 2 is better, but this one certainly is not bad at all.  This one is a stylish action packed revenge story, with good performances and is lots of fun.  The second one is more of a character driven drama, with 2 cool fights, and a brief but still well choreographed fight between Bill and the bride.  Also i must say that apart the movies are great, but if they were put together, which they will be soon, they would be 10 times greater.  I a waiting for the merged dvd because i would prefer watchin the whole bloody affair all at once, hint hint, (thats what the combined version is going to be called).  I give this movie a 9 out of a 10, i thought the reference to pimping out the bride while she is in her coma was kind of stupid, but everything else kicks a$$, esspecially the gogo fight.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I, like most people, bought this cd based on my liking of &quot;Take Me Out.&quot; I'm a huge fan of the British band Pulp and felt the singers voice and the music reminded me so much of Jarvis Cocker and his band. He especially pulled on Mr. Cocker, I felt with &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;Matinee.&quot;  <br /> While the cd does have some high moments, &quot;Tell Her Tonight,&quot; &quot;Come On Home,&quot; &quot;Take Me Out,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Matinee,&quot; the album comes off as sounding rushed at some points. Would I see them live? Most probably. There's something about a group whose band members know how to dress when they really aren't required to. However, I would think twice about purchasing another one of their cds.
0425173755|4.0|Agatha Cristie does it again, in her Hercule Poirot mystery, Murder on the Orient Express. Known as Mystery's #1 Best-selling Author Agatha Cristie writes the astonishing mystery about a detective, Hercule Poirot, on vacation when a snowstorm brings his train to a standstill a murder takes place in the cabin next to his own. Agatha Cristie has great talent when twisting plots and this is no exception. <br />     <br />    In the beginning of the book, chapters two and three, Agatha Cristie leads you on to suspicious characters before the crime even takes place. In this specific case some of the members on the train are built even before Hercule gets on the Orient Express. He encounters a man and a women on his previous train of whom he is suspicious of and even the victim and his co workers, all of which he quickly decides to keep a close eye on. A few pros and cons with this technique are as follow. The con, at some points you feel as the story will never continue, that the whole time all you will know about is this persons paranoia. The pros, firstly, you feel as though you must continue to read because something is bound to happen. Another point is you began to think you know who are the bad guys and as mentioned early Agatha Cristie knows how to twist a plot.  <br />     <br />    Towards the middle of the book, chapter 63, another story is introduced. One of a crime that took place a few years back. The second story, is brought up from a piece of evidence, it is about a three year old girl who was kidnapped and turned up dead, weeks later. When it is first introduced it could tend to be a bit confusing and also a little frustrating because just when you think you know who the murderer is in a single chapter you know there's more to it then you originally thought. This does however add a bit of excitement to pick the book back up after a couple of informative yet on the boring side chapters. This gives the detective his hunch that this kidnapping case will lead him to the murder. <br />     <br />    The next section in the book is labeled the Evidence. In which Agatha Cristie introduces you to every member in the coach. She goes through and gets to you to feel sorry for some and suspicious of others. This part is great, and is why the characters being built before the crime is no longer a necessity. This part leads up to some great discoveries made by the detective and evidently the unusual and surprising outcome. <br />     <br />    Agatha Cristie is able to teach and put morals into the most unusual stories in this case she incorporates pay back, love, and the common never give up ideas. Though this is not my favorite mystery of all time I have no regrets in reading it and do plan on reading future Agatha Cristie novels. <br />
6305907145|1.0|It's a free world, so the filmakers are free to make whatever kind of adaptation of Mansfield Park as they like - no matter how dissimilar the film becomes as compared to the book.  That said, it is both sad and frustrating that a film such as this is made.  As many people have stated below, this film does not come close to representing the spirit of Jane Austen's work.  It would be fairer to say that this film accurately represents the spirit of Uncle Tom's Cabin or Nicholas Nickleby.  The people who will be inclined to like this film are the ones who enjoy spending money on movies that have plotlines which expose the evils and injustices of slavery and the class system - in a word, leftists.  I'm always amused when I listen to people as they try to explain their interest in such stories.  They use many of the same words and terms that the five star reviewers on this page use, such as: ambiguous; depth of character; character flaw; darker undercurrents; nuanced; socioeconomic; hollywood (as a pejorative description); cookie cutter; pablum; and of course, bourgeois.  If leftists want to make a movie about class struggle and the evils that white men have caused throughout history I think that's great.  I would just appreciate it if they would avoid using a literary classic that has nothing to do with that as a vehicle for their political agenda.
B000002U82|5.0|Quality: A++++++++  <br />Sound: A++++++++ <br />Value for money : A++++++++++ <br /> <br />Would have easily give it 10 stars. If you like pink floyd you should buy this album. Dark Side Of The Moon (further; D.S.O.T.M) is a excellent masterpiece. <br /> <br />My favorites: <br /> <br />Great gig in the sky ( A++++++++++++++++++++++++) <br />TIME (A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++) <br />Money (A++++++++++++++) <br /> <br />but the ohter tracks are very very very well indeed. Some people don't know that in Germany one record press only presses D.S.O.T.M for more than 30 years now. Why? Because it is a extremly good cd, Every one should own this. <br /> <br />As you might have guessed i am a D.S.O.T.M. freak. Mind the loudspeakers especialy on track money, time and a great gig in the sky. They go very high on treble and also deep in the bass as well. <br /> <br />the MFSL  (24 karat gold) disc is the best, then comes the SACD version, the twenty year version, and finaly the original studio album. <br /> <br />Like one of the Young Ones (with Cliff Richard in living doll) <br /> <br />\\"if you don't buy this record than your ata ata ata !\\" <br /> <br />D.S.O.T.M should be in every one's collection !!
B00005JLR8|5.0|I am incredulous that this film was criminally overlooked at the Oscars this year.  Whereas other films may have had more technical attributes(\\"The Return of the King\\") or star-power driven(\\"Mystic River\\") or inexplicably critically acclaimed(the crappy \\"Lost in Translation), this film had the best story and the best ensemble acting.  This is the story of a family coming to America from Ireland looking for not only the economic opportunity this country promises but to a put a tragic past behind them.  The five principle actors in this film are all uniformly excellent.  Samantha Morton was justifiably nominated for an Oscar as the mother and wife trying to hold together her family through harsh economic and emotional times while subordinating her own needs.  Djimon Hounsou is excellent as the bitter dying artist who takes a chance by allowing this family to enter into his life.  Paddy Considine's performance is probably the most overlooked because he plays a man who struggles to provide for his family financially but internalizes his personal pain.  The real delight here are the performances by the Bolger sisters, Emma and Sarah.  Despite all the hardship they've experienced, they put an uncomplaining sunny face on everything.  Despite the gloom and despair that hang over this family, the efforts of the actors here make America seem like a magical place.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|One morning (the only time any cable music station actually plays music videos) I was flipping channels and I came across Franz Ferdinand's \\"Take Me Out\\". To me it was incredibly refreshing and so I went out and bought the CD that very day. <br /> <br />However, upon listening to the rest of the album, I was not really struck by any of the other songs. I didn't think of them as bad, but they certianly weren't good enough to listen to over and over again. After getting my fill of \\"Take Me Out\\", I proclaimed the CD mediocre and put it away. <br /> <br />A few weeks later I was very bored and needed some new music to listen to, so I again took out the album. I really don't know what I was thinking the first time I listened to it, because it's one of the most fun and sexy rock albums I've ever heard. My favorites (which are near the end of the album, unfortunately, so they can't be previewed on Amazon.com) are \\"This Fire\\", \\"Michael\\", and \\"40'\\". <br /> <br />Over all, Franz Ferdinand is weak in a couple of places, but definately of interest to any rock fan who wants to hear something new. Finally, a rock band you can dance to, I mean, really dance to.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|I am an unabashed Kubrick fan.  I was initiated into his work with \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" when I was 16 and went from there.  Why is it that \\"Barry Lyndon\\" has in my mind surpassed other more revered works.  You can cite the magnificent technical attributes of the film(cinematography,art direction, costume design,music), however, a technically proficient movie is not necessarily a moving experience.  I would have to say that what elevates this movie is the screenplay and the acting.  Kubrick does a great job moving the story from Redmond Barry's youth to his downfall among the English aristocracy.  Kubrick has also gathered a great cast of actors here in supporting roles(Parick Magee, Leonard Rossiter, Marie Kean, Godfrey Quigley, Steven Berkof, etc.).  What cannot be overlooked is the performance of Ryan O'Neal.  If some find him wooden or off-putting should consider that he is essentially playing an unsympathetic rogue.  It is a daring performance and O'Neal is utterly convincing whether playing a headstrong teenager or a cold manipulator.  One gripe about the DVDs in the Kubrick Collection: with the exception of \\"The Shining\\", the only extras on these discs are trailers.
B00007GZR5|2.0|I read the book by the same title for the first time in 1984. I was entranced by it. I have since read this book about once a year because I feel that it is that wonderful and I get something new out of it each time I read it. I had always hoped that they would make it into a movie. Lo and behold, 15 years later they did. I couldn't wait to see. When I did I was extremely disappointed. I hated that the screenwriters felt the need to change the original story line so much, because I did not see the need to change so lovely and magical a story line. For me, that completely ruined the movie. If I had not read the book first I would have probably enjoyed it more. If I were Mr. Matheson, I would have felt violated by all the changes, which in the movie, turned out to be contrived, cheesy and predictable. The only aspect of this movie that I did enjoy was the visuals. If one has not yet read the original book, do so now, it is extraordinary!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|When I bought this CD I bought it because I loved his song \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" which was his first single and the theme song for the the WB show One Tree Hill.   But when I listened to the CD, there were so many songs that were even better than \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\".  Now I am completely addicted to this CD.  There is not one song on here that isn't worth listening to and I definitely recommend this CD to EVERYONE!!!!
B0000027K7|5.0|A Rock Classic! Perhaps, one of the most underrated albums ever. Simply put this album, which was originally released in 1969, made we want to go out and buy a guitar when I first heard it. The quality of the CD transfer is exceptional. Every song on this album is terrific...great driving music as well! The songs cover the gambut of musical &quot;ebbs&quot; and &quot;flows&quot; from the quintessential rock anthem &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; (which, in my opinion, could have been voted 1 of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll by the Rock n'Roll Hall of Fame) to the gripping and heartfelt, &quot;Theme for an Imaginary Western&quot; (this is one of my wife's favorite songs to this day). Tremendous songwriting and gut-wrenching guitar playing by Leslie West, truly one of the great rock guitarists. Mr. West doesn't play fast, but plays in a raucous, electric blues-rock form, which is melodic and hauntingly moving; to me that makes for better guitar. The other members of the band, Felix Pappalardi - bass(and producer of the Cream albums), Corky Laing - drums, and Steve Knight - keyboards, are exceptional in their own right and contribute to making this one of the true classic rock albums! If you do not own this record, you are missing out! As the CD sleeve suggests, &quot;THIS RECORD WAS MADE TO BE PLAYED LOUD&quot;. <br />&quot;Beloved, if God so loved us, <BR>we ought also to love one another&quot;<br />John 1: 11
6305922756|5.0|This is Spinal Tap is, inarguably, a classic comedy.  Now, with the recent trend of brainless teen boppers (Brittney, Christina, Jessica, etc) it has again become all the more relevant.  The really great thing about this film is that it's not all about the rock and roll, the truly hilarious observations and conversations come from the trio just being human and having enormous egos.  This one definitely deserves a second look, if not only for the classic scenes (Stonehedge, the airport metal detector, Puppet Show and Spinal Tap...)  Do yourself a large favor and crank this one to 11 all over again.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|Mystic River (directed by Clint Eastwood) remains a mystery for various reasons. Notwithstanding the unfolding of the 'complex' plot at the end, various aspects related with the movie & direction along with the innumerable \\"appreciative & impressive\\" press reviews remains well- \\"mystical\\". Why so because the direction as well as the script seemed overrated. What makes this rather slow paced movie watch-able throughout is the strong ensemble cast (Tim Robbins,Sean Penn,Kevin Bacon,Lawrence Fishburne,Marcia Gay Harden)- with Tim Robbins being superb.    The film begins with three boys; Dave (Robbins), Jimmy (Penn) & Sean (Bacon) playing street hockey. While the two boys- Jimmy & Sean inscribes their name with a stick at a wet street-side pavement slab; Dave as he was writing his name could only write the first two initials \\"D A\\" while they were being interrupted by possible pedophiles acting as cops. As Dave was then unfortunately taken away in their car & physically abused (shown in small flashes), the childhood trauma remained with him even as he grows up. As he (Robbins) looked at the pavement where the names were inscribed, his life looked a broken-unfinished one; as was his unfinished name there. While another tragedy, the murder of Jimmy's teenaged daughter Katie [Emmy Rossum] affects all their lives decades later, the story spins a web of mystery & suspicion. Dave's blood drenched hands at the night of the murder makes him a suspect & so was Katie's boyfriend. Even the mystery woman calling Sean (Bacon) from some phone booth (her voice being phased out) adds to the suspense. May be Eastwood wanted to add some enigma to this thriller genre with her as another suspect of sort...Whoooo!!! But other than these few 'soft touches', the film really doesn't keep u glued to the screen or make u think wild about the plot- well if you would really want to.    While Sean Penn's performance is good, it's not exceptional for an \\"OSCAR\\" ( considering Tom Cruise wasn't even nominated for 'The Last Samurai' the same year).Laura Linney being left out in the whole movie to show her skills, suddenly tries to do a lot at the end and it falls flat. Also what Dave(Robbins)actually did that eventful night could have been shown a 'bit more' visually to make it interesting rather than letting audience visualize it mentally. Overall an \\"average\\" movie but certainly not a \\"Great\\" one. I will give it a max of Two Stars (**) rating for the cast - especially Robbins.    (...)
B00008EY65|4.0|Wildly gothic and imaginative, Hellboy simply put is one hell of a good movie.  In the era that very few comic book films live up to their colorful pedigrees, Hellboy fleshes out what the comic created, creating a cinematic experience that is not only action packed, but startingly human as well.  Centering all of this magic is an incredable performance by Ron Pearlman as the title character.  Hellboy is certainly no one's first image of a hero, more of a tragic anti-hero who is just doing the job that he feels he was put on Earth to do.  But with Pearlman's excellent rendition, he gives Hellboy a heart and provides many humourous and human moments.  The special effects and make up effects are top notch and the action scenes are destructive and large scale.  But, in the end, it is the story and characters that win us over.  An extremely rare feat in a summer film, or plain action films in general.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Rick is a genius, he has taken another band and made them change their sound for the better, he has produced a variety of acts(Johnny Cash,Slayer,RHCP,Beastie Boys,SOAD)and have made them successful, this is not your typical nu-metal CD. Corey and Joey are great as always but what the big difference is that Mick and James are now a guitar duo to be reckoned with, Mick has proven he can shred with the best of them and if slipknot keeps this up they will get better and better and they will never let up. I had found myself to be losing respect for Slipknot but this CD has changed all that they are now credible musicians although they could stand to lose some of their members(maybe 5 or 6 instead of 9).
B00003CY0V|2.0|Swordfish is a high gloss, low concept action film without a smidgen of reality.  Everything in this film looks completely fake; from Halle Berry's bare breasts, to John Travolta's laughably inane attempts to speak cool dialogue, this film is a cheap Hollywood product all the way through.  Think of it as Lethal Weapon without the funny diagloue, Speed without the tireless momentum, Spiderman without the heroic prince.  Think of it however you want... just don't bother seeing it.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Hearing great reviews from the film I checked it out at my local video store and when I watched it I was totally amazed at how simple it was.  The film may be slow but the depth that you receive from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson's characters is a wonderful thing to see on screen.  They have an odd chemistry that works.  The cinematography is wonderful.  It displays the city of Tokeo as a vibrant place that never sleeps.  I reccomend this film for anyone who loves to see great acting.  The DVD has a few extras and the picture is wonderful.  The movie I give four stars.  The DVD, I give three and a half.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|...Your not a real fan of this genre and need to kill your self and do us all a favor.Anyways,unearth's music being the purest form of metal-core you can find its hard not to be into them. I just can't see how you could be into metal-core and metal in general and still dislike such a genious and talented couple of musicians such as unearth! First, redchord is by far  beyond talented people and i  love their music but so is unearth and to be fair their just as good and if not more talented and im not even saying nothing bad about the allmighty redchord because im a huge fan of their music and i own their album fused together in revolving doors which i thought was a masterpiece of blast beats and just out of this world. Unearth's latest  oncoming storm is for true metalcore lovers and if you find yourself not liking this then you dont need to go to metal concerts at all.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|In the world of movies there are little sequels that are good, and very few that are better than the originals.  X2 X Men United, surpasses the original definately.  The action is more stylized and frequent.  The characters develop more.  The scenery and locations are more dangerous and exciting, and the plot is more suspensful and edgy.  The DVD of this film is full of extras including documentaries, trailers, and commentaries.  My question is, will X-3 be even better than X-2?  I guess we will find out in 2005.
B00002E224|1.0|If your thresholds for dialogue and acting  are <br />low, or if you need no more than the thinnest semblance <br />of a romance,  this movie will satisy you. Otherwise,  <br />I recommend that it be avoided, even as a preamble <br />to Before Sunset - and that you see Brief Encounter <br />instead. <br /> <br />John Huston said that a good movie has five good scenes and no <br />bad scenes. The first clinker in this one arrives early.  The kids <br />have just met, Ethan has convinced ( lamely ) Julie to tag along, <br />and they board a light rail. Ethan decides that they should have <br />a revealing Q & A. He goes first, and instead of asking Julie how <br />she feels about poetry, or music, or frog soup, he asks her <br />what her favorite sexual position is, or if she's ever tried a <br />vibrating egg. A great start. ( That's not quite the truth, <br />but his opening question IS something from the Newlywed <br />Game. ) <br /> <br />Throughout this scene, which is poorly edited, Hawke looks left <br />at least twelve times ( away from Julie ), drawing attention to himself while Julie tries to answer the questions - and to act like an <br />actor instead of as a poseur. <br />  <br />There isn't a jot of humor, or of clever dialogue, and Viena is wasted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001AVZA8|4.0|When I watched this film, I realized that this film is a one of a kind.  There has never been a romantic comedy with older men and women as the main characters.  Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton are a great onscreen pair.  They should work again someday.  The movie was funny, smart, hip, and cool.  The setting was beautiful (The Hamptons) and it fit the story perfectly.  Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand gave amusing supporting roles as well.  The DVD has a great transfer along with a few bonus features.  I reccomend this for anyone who loves romance and laughs.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one of Miyazaki's best works.  The story is enchanting, the animation is great, and the character development is wonderful.  Even though its meant for younger viewers, I can't help but become suspenseful at a few moments in the film.  Definitely one to watch with the family, as it is adults and kids friendly.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This movie can be respectively called the oddysey of all romance films.  An epic of romantic proportions this film focuses on a number of romantic relationships that are all linked.  Set in the beautiful city of London the movie is charming and spreads the Christmas spirit.  It will make you want to fall in love.  Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth are hilights of the movie.  Laura Linney and Keira Knightly also have good performances.  All in all it is a good movie for adults to watch in the holidays.  The DVD has a few features and a great transfer.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Will and his father Edward have become estranged over the years because of the many tall tales that Edward has told his son.  When Will receives a phone call from his mother telling him that his father is dying, he knows he must go to him and find out who his father really is and what is the truth about his life.  Whenever Will asks questions, his father replies with the outlandish stories that he has heard all of his life.  As the movie continues, Will finds out that not all of his father's stories are fantasy, and those that are have served a purpose in his life.  This is a beautifully told tale of fact vs. fancy, and the reconciliation of a father and son.  It is touching and is well-acted and directed.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This film is the most underrated movie of the year.  It did well at the box office, and scored well with critics but when Oscar time came around we only had one nod.  This is among Tim Burton's finest creations.  The story, effects, acting, score, and humor all come together beautifully in this film and no one ever noticed.  Best Acting goes out to Jessica Lange who wins the crowd with her devoted wife role.  I reccomend this film to everyone.  The DVD is great too.
B00004XQ8E|4.0|I own nine different recordings of Mahler's Das Lied Von Der Erde, and I would probably rate this somewhere in the middle, with Kubelik, Sanderling, and Klemperer ahead of it, and close to on-par with the Horenstein.  <br />  <br /> This is an excellent and deservedly legendary performance. Patzak and Ferrier both give extremely artistic performances. There is great charisma and depth to their singing and interpretation of the words and melodies. However, technically, there are far better performances out there (they were both past their prime). Fritz Wunderlich, Peter Schrier, and Waldemar Kmentt as tenor and Janet Baker and Alfreda Hodgson as alto come to mind immediately. Bruno Walter gives a very moving reading of the song cycle, but the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra does not perform very well. It sounds rather unrehearsed and unrefined (and not in a good &quot;fresh&quot; way). <br />  <br /> What you have here is a very moving, very magical performance of Das Lied Von Der Erde that should be heard by everyone. But it saddens me to think that many people would purchase this as their &quot;only&quot; recording of this piece (due to the justifiably positive reviews) and feel they can explore this piece sufficiently with it.  <br />  <br /> I highly recommend checking out the Kubelik/Baker/Kmentt recording. It is an absolutely essential recording with a brilliant conductor, excellent orchestra and sound, the best alto performance available for this work (Baker!), and an excellent tenor. Klemperer and Sanderling give equally amazing readings with two of the best tenors you will ever hear perform this piece (Schrier and Wunderlich, respectively).  <br />  <br /> Although I find this recording to be far inferior to the three mentioned above, I truly believe one must own several recordings of this work, and in that respect, this Walter/Ferrier deserves the shelf space.

014118213X|5.0|In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief.  Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.  When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore.  Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims.  When Henry asserts that Porphyria Fire Insurance Co. is on the verge of collapse, Helen and Margaret persuade Leonard Bast, a young clerk they have befriended, to resign his position there, only to have him later \\"downsized\\" out of his subsequent bank job.  Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on those over whom they have little control.  Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success.  When Helen returns from Germany, where she has been living, and Henry and his family discover she is pregnant, Henry's belief that her condition reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry.  Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it.  With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm of the country and that its conflicts are those of the nation.

B000002H97|5.0|Metallica is easily the greatest heavy metal band due to their heavy yet melodic songs and strong lyrics. This is Metallica at their best, Kirk Hammett proves he is one of the greatest guitarists of all time and James Hetfield finally becomes an incredible frontman along with Lars Ulrichs thunderous yet complex drumming. I'll rate the songs: <br /> <br />Enter Sandman: 10\10 <br />Easily the greatest heavy metal song ever and also serves as a great introduction to the bands greatest album.  <br /> <br />Sad But True: 10\10 <br />This song is truly heavy with a great guitar solo by Kirk Hammett and screaming vocals from James Hetfield. Lars' drumming also applies here. Greatness. <br /> <br />Holier than thou: 10\10 <br />This song remains heavy all the time while still having awesome lyrics and yes people, another awesome guitar solo. <br /> <br />The Unforgiven: 10\10 <br />Now, this is a bit different. This song has very heavy verses and a softer but still Metallica chorus. Another fine guitar solo. <br /> <br />I WILL STOP TALKING ABOUT GUITAR SOLOS SINCE THEY ARE ALL GREAT <br /> <br />Wherever I May Roam: 10\10 <br />Great intro, it makes you think this song will be much softer, man was I surprised. Perfect song with no flaws whatsoever. <br /> <br />Don't Tread on me: 9\10 <br />This song could have been longer, but it has a great tune and should be the new national anthem. <br /> <br />Through the Never: 9\10 <br />Not the best song, but certainly still awesome. The interlude after the guitar solo is awesome. <br /> <br />Nothing Else Matters: 7.5\10 <br />The worst song on the album, it has a good tune but the verses are repeated over and over. <br /> <br />Of wolf and man: 9\10 <br />Great tune with strong lyrics, not as catchy, though. <br /> <br />The God that Failed: 9\10 <br />I would give this a 10, but after a while this song doesn't seem so great. <br /> <br />My friend of misery: 10\10 <br />The best guitar solo on the album is here, plus very strong lyrics and great drumming. <br /> <br />The Struggle Within: 9\10 <br />Great intro but the verses aren't that great. <br /> <br />Well, there you have it. This album is a must-have along with Nirvana's Nevermind, Led Zeppelin IV and Black Sabbath's Paranoid. Definately worth the money.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I don't actually understand the other reviews on here. To me it seems absurd to analyze each aspect of a movie, and criticise individually.  To me, this is missing the forest for the trees and I don't see how people can do this and miss out on the fact that this is a truly great movie.  How I review a movie is this:  when I sit down afterward and ask myself if I enjoyed it. When this movie was over, it left me regretting that fact.  Daniel Day Lewis' performance was outstanding, and Leonardo DiCaprio's was great too. I don't see a necessity for the movie to follow a stereotypical hero-protagonist-as-central-character in order for the movie to be as great as it could be. As far as the characters being stereotypical, I found this to be anything but true. I thought Day Lewis' character as well as DiCaprio's were complex, and maybe others who watched the film missed out on their complexity. In fact, the whole film pretty much blasts away at one's tidy view of good vs. evil, or how American civilization back in those days really was. There are these little lost corners of history that people forget, that are like a furnace in which cities like New York are born. It's important to remember that Leonardo's character is one of the only characters in the entire movie who is not based on history as in the book \\"Gangs of New York\\". This is why I seriously recommend that when you watch the movie, you buy/rent the DVD and watch ALL of the special features including those which discuss the history behind the making of this best of films. This is the master, Martin Scorcese at his absolute finest, on the cutting edge of film making and I imagine it will take many years before this film is fully appreciated as it so richly deserves. Do not confuse visceral authenticity which marks Scorcese as the great director that he is, for being low-brow.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelins best. With such classics as Stairway to Heaven, Black Dog and Rock N' Roll. I won't rate these songs because they're all awesome, scoring at least 8.5\10. This is a must-have from the greatest band of all time even though there are only eight songs (8-tracks were used until 1980 something). Just buy it, it's definately better than Gay Charlotte or Licken starch. It's pretty cheap too.

His charactor is deep and he portrays a kind of Villain good guy role you never know which until the end.  The scenery is awesome and the fight scenes excellent except the river scene in which the gun shots sound strange but overall an exclellent movie that keeps you guessing with deep plots and excellent charactors.  Absolutely the Best!
B000000WCA|1.0|I think it was 1998 when some retarded third graders introduced me to this s***. Back then I was 8 and I was going through my first music phase which has enormously improved over the past six years. I liked them because I didn't know anything better before since I was too young. But it was only 3 months before I moved on to my next phase which was video games. Now that I have discovered Nirvana and Metallica I am and going to stay in metal and some grunge\punk. Here were my phases: <br />'98 - British Pop (It sucks) <br />'99 - Regular Pop (No) <br />'00 - 01 - Some rock <br />'02 - Eighties (Don't ask) <br />'02 - 03 - Rap <br />'03 - Punk <br />'04 - Grunge and Metal <br /> <br />This is what usually will happen to kids. Okay back to the review, these songs are very repetative with only two singers who are the black one and some dark haired one. This was the beginning of the end for music.
031286504X|5.0|I Am Legend became the basis for two so-so movies during the 60's and 70's. If you've seen either movie (\\"The Last Man on Earth\\" featuring Vincent Price and \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charleton Heston), you'll get a taste of the theme without the full flavor of this marvelous novel's full meal.<br /><br />A plague has been released on mankind. Everyone has turned into Vampires except for Robert Neville.In a very clever inversion of Dracula, the last remaining human becomes the monster in their eyes as all of humanity has changed except him.  He's not just an outsider but a crusading outsider --the Van Helsing of the book--bent on destroying these mutant creatures.<br /><br />Matheson's novel isn't just about horror but about character. His best work has always concentrated on the humanity of his characters and trying to create a convincing world where they just don't fit anymore (The Shrinking Man is another fine example of this theme). Skillfully written, I Am Legend doesn't feature blood splattering or gore at the turn of every page (this was written in the 50's folks) but concentrates on character, mood and suspense as it does on the horror that drives the story.<br /><br />I have to agree with Dean Koontz and Stephen King about Matheson--he set the standard for the modern horror story with his thoughtful, carefully plotted stories and glimpse into these isolated characters. Like fellow writers Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont and William F. Nolan, Matheson's stories turn as much on the creepiness of the situation and core idea as they do on the convincing characters he creates. He doesn't rely on cheap tricks nor on a bloody rampage to keep you turning the pages. If you're the type of person who always has to investigate a place where there's a prominent \\"Keep Out\\" sign (or did so as a kid)or did something precisely because the other kids wouldn't do it, you'll appreciate Matheson's complex character driven horror and science fiction stories. I'd also recommend A Stir of Echoes (adapted into the criminally underrated but quite different film of the same name).Stir of Echoes (adapted into the criminally underrated but quite different film of the same name).
B000002KIE|4.0|The Sex Pistols are the greatest punk band ever, well if you dont count Nirvana as a punk band. They were one of the only mainstream one back in the late seventies as well along with the Ramones and The Clash. I love songs like \\"Bodies\\" and \\"Problems\\" mainly because those songs are like so rebelious and its like you vs. The Sex Pistols type thing. This band rules and if you're a punkrock fan you should already have this (if you don't you're a poseur) and if you're not a punk fan (like me) get it anyway, this album rules and this is real punk, not the crap record labels pass off as punk these days.
0553801546|5.0|I've discovered something about Robin Hobb, something that has recoloured my view of Golden Fool.  Hobb writes slow-paced character studies that emphasize that character over the action.  She writes about relationships, and she writes them very effectively.  I still found Golden Fool to be too slow with the character interaction not as interesting as she has shown she is capable of.  However, I now have a bit more of an understanding of it.  That is because I read the third book in the series, Fool's Fate.  This book is more of the same, but I found it much more interesting.  Fitzchivalry Farseer is still going through rough times, but it seems to have more of a point to it than it did in the second book.<br /><br />Fool's Fate seems very unusual in that the \\"climax\\" of the book takes place almost two-thirds of the way through the book, with the rest of it dealing with all the scattered pieces of Fitz's life that Hobb has left and how Fitz attempts to put them back together. This is where I realized what the point of this series was.  It wasn't just the story of a dragon-quest and a political alliance.  It was the story of how far Fitz has come since the events in the first Assassin series, a story of relationships.  The dragon is important, but only in relation to Fitz and Dutiful and the past that Fitz has to face.  The pace of the book is extremely slow, but Hobb's strong writing makes it interesting (unlike the second book, which I think just came across as too depressing to be interesting).  The text is dense and you won't plow through it in a day or two.  That could be a fault if you don't like that sort of thing.  I do, when it's done well, so I loved it.<br /><br />Another strength that Fool's Fate had that Golden Fool didn't have was that it didn't seem as contrived.  Many times in the previous book, Fitz had to be spying a lot so that the reader could understand what was going on.  He was constantly sneaking through the secret passages in the castle so that he could watch, for example, the Bingtown Traders come for an audience with the Queen.  That's a hazard of writing in the first person, and I thought it let Hobb down in the second.  Not this time.  There is a little bit of spying, but not a lot.  Exposition isn't quite as necessary in Fool's Fate, it being much more immediate to Fitz.  He's also directly involved a lot more, so what exposition there is comes more from a character relating the story to Fitz.  In large doses this would be tiresome too, but Hobb minimizes it.<br /><br />All of the characters are extremely interesting and three-dimensional.  The only one who gets short shrift is the villain of the piece.  I realize that's because she isn't that important in the grand scheme of things, but considering how evil she is and some of the things she does, I found the cursory way she was dealt with disappointing.  Her influence is felt more in the surroundings than it is directly by her actions, and this is actually quite effective.  Consider her even, with both a huge plus and a huge minus.  Every other character, however, is far up on the plus scale.<br /><br />The only other character fault is Thick, but it's not because he's badly characterized.  He actually gets a lot of development and is one of the most three-dimensional characters in the bunch.  However, I just found him annoying.  His constant whining about not getting on a boat, constantly being sick, his single-mindedness, all of it was just aggravating.  If he doesn't reach your annoyance threshold, then you will like this book even more then I did.  And I did like it a lot.<br /><br />The relationship between the Fool and Fitz is very touching, a love that goes beyond lovers and even beyond family.  I think that one of the strengths of Fool's Fate was that they weren't at each other's throats so much as they were in the second book.  Their relationship colours everything else in the book, and the book lives or dies on it.  They have their arguments in this one, but you don't feel like the heart has been ripped out of the book.  What happens is almost tragic, and the way the relationship is left feels almost fitting.  It's an ending and a beginning, and they have to decide whether being together will be part of that.<br /><br />Finally, Hobb does a wonderful job with pulling together all of her series.  If you read this series first, you will find out a lot of what happens in the first Assassin series, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  She ties together that series and the Bingtown Traders one into a cohesive whole, using elements of everything to leave the world in a different place than when she started.  She also ends it fairly definitively, so there doesn't appear any chance of a sequel.  This is a good thing, as it would be nice to see her try something new.  I know she has written as Megan Lindholm, but it would be interesting to see where she goes as Robin Hobb.  Here's to another book, but definitely in a different world.  Give the whole series a try, reading the second book with an eye to what I said above.  You'll probably enjoy the second book a lot more than I did, and then you'll have this wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />David Roytheir arguments in this one, but you don't feel like the heart has been ripped out of the book.

B000002H33|5.0|This is a truly FLAWLESS release and now its 2004 and it still kicks ass.Very TALENTED and the lyrics are SPOT ON.It's best to purchase this album and READ THE LYRICS (WHICH ARE TRUE,NOT BS) and fully appreciate that REAL METAL NEVER DIES REGARDLESS HOW OLD IT GETS.Forget the rest get the BEST.
B00005176F|5.0|The guy who compared Blur to R.E.M needs to rethink that one...you are talking about Blur, right?
B00005JN2X|5.0|I went to see a matinee of Collateral show expecting a much different movie than I saw. I was expecting a lot of violence, over the top characters, and not to much of a story. What I got instead was possibly the best movie of 2004. <br />  <br />Max(Foxx) drives a cab in Los Angeles for a living. He says it's his side job and his plan is to one day run his own limo service. He takes pride in his work in being the best cabbie in LA. He picks up Annie(Smith)who bets him her way to getting to downtown is faster. He wins the bet and charms over the girl. He's to shy though to ask for her number when she leaves. She comes back and gives it to him, and we see that Max really is a nice guy whose plans are taking him longer than expected. <br /> <br />A man quickly enters the cab. He asks Max to take him to his destination and Max give him an ETA. After he makes the ETA the gentleman give him a proposition. He'll give him $600 to drive him around the whole night. Max reluctantly agrees to the man. He introduces himself as Vincent(Cruise) and says he looks forward to a great quick evening. <br /> <br />Things quickly turn bad when a body falls from the second floor onto the cab. Max realizes Vincent just killed the man though Vincent just says \\"I shoot him, the bullets and the fall killed him.\\" Vincent takes Max hostage and tells him he will drive him around town or he will kill him. Now Max is stuck with Vincent as he takes him to murder people. The ultimate target though is the DA Annie who Vincent just met and likes. Now he must stop Vincent and save innocent people before they die. <br /> <br />The acting in Collateral is terrific. Jamie Foxx is great as Max. This is a different role for him. He's known more for his comedy and cocky characters like in Any Given Sunday. Max is an Average Joe kind of guy we can all relate to. His plans aren't coming as fast as he wants them to. Foxx plays the role to perfection and he has me really looking forward to seeing him play Ray inThe Ray Charles movie later this year. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise steals the show as the killer Vincent. It's a much different role for Cruise because he's the bad guy. He takes the bad guy and runs with it. Vincent is a cold killer who does it for a living. He has no remorse for the people he kills. He's confident in his abilities but not cocky. He'll do anything to achieve his round as he shows to Max in brute force. Cruise brings an intensity to the character. He's charming when he needs to be and we see that Tom Cruise we love. He becomes Vincent and is flawless. This is one of his best performance of his storied carear and is as good or if not better than some of his Oscar nominated performances. At this point he has to be the favorite for what should be a \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" nomination.  <br /> <br />Michael Mann directs this film to perfection. A lot takes place in a cab and he utalizes a a lot of different camera shots so you don't get bored during all the dialogue. He allows the characters to develop in the movie and thats what makes the movie drive. He shots the fight scenes to perfection especially the big one in the club. <br /> <br />Steven Beattie wrote the movie and he has himself an Oscar caliber screenplay here. His only other big time writing was with Pirates of the Carribean and he exceeds that here. The script is beautiful. It's comical when it needs to be. The dialogue never drags and it isn't boring. He doesn't waste lines in the movie and it's why the characters develop so well. <br /> <br />Collateral is a great movie. The critics nationwide have loved it. It's not some cheap action thriller. Michael Mann doesn't let us out that easy but puts together a great action thriller with character and substance. The movie is flawless. There isn't anything not to like. Bring on the Oscars because this movie deserves some and maybe Tom Cruise can finally get one because he sure does deserve it. You don't want to miss Collateral.
B000286S8S|5.0|What's good about it?<br /><br />You don't need me to tell you about all the monster (and minor) hits that are on this disc; you know them, you love them.  Unless of course you're one of those people that can't enjoy both versions of Van Halen.  Either way, there's plenty of classic material to please David Roth fans (15 songs) and Sammy Hagar fans alike (15 songs).  There are three live (Hagar) tracks thrown in for filler, and three brand new studio tracks to celebrate the reunion.  These are the tracks you really want to know about.<br /><br />\\"It About Time\\" is the first track that was released to radio, and it appears to be the Van Halen reunion anthem.  There's really no other way to explain the lyrics.  It's you typical Van Hagar song.  The heavy opening riff continues where \\"Humans Being\\" left off.  The arrangement is a little congested, but the track tends to grow on you.  \\"Learning to See\\" has Sammy Hagar's writing style all over it.  It's a thoughtful power ballad that tries hard to capture the magic of past Van Halen jems.  I think more of \\"Feeling\\" than of \\"Right Now\\".  Eddie shows that he's still the master of the fret board during his extensive solo.  Led by a great chugga-chugga riff, \\"Up for Breakfast\\" is a blues based song loaded with plenty of sexual innuendo. Take a guess what she's getting up.<br /><br />Anything bad?<br /><br />Worst Van Halen album cover ever!!  This release makes your purchase of Best of Volume 1 worthless, except for the two new Roth tracks.<br /><br />Bottom Line<br /><br />The most complete Van Halen hits collection!  This should have been the one released years ago.  I guess there's no chance of Vol. 2 seeing the light of day.  The Best of Both Worlds is sure to please Hagar and Roth fans alike.  The new songs take a little getting used to.  In my opinion, they're not as good as the Roth songs on the last Best Of.  As far as the reunion goes, only time will tell if this is the real thing or a quick cash-in.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|After I purchased Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I watched it after not seeing it since I was little, and I had forgotten how much I liked the movie. I think that it is one of the best Disney movies out there to date.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This film was so bad that all the existing copies should be destroyed, the writer and directer keel-hauled. I only made it through to just past the cemetary scene.  <br /> <br />It is a shallow reworkinging of the storying and is an unmitigated failure. <br />
0140366822|3.0|I was interested by the comment that \\"Pollyanna,\\" in the opening chapters at least, has so many similarities to \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L.M. Montgomery. I have thought that myself, and wondered why it never seems to be pointed out. especially as \\"Pollyanna\\" was published only 4 years after Montgomery's instantly famous book. Perhaps it is because it develops differently as the book progresses. <br />As to my opinion of it, I can only repeat \\"mixed feelings.\\" Just as I am about to dismiss it as corny, unrealistic and third-rate, I find that I actually want to keep reading it! I have to admit, young girls like it - I liked it without reservations when I was a young girl, and made a point recently of finding a copy for my eight -year-old.
B00005YXZH|1.0|Some guy said that he couldn't post a 1 star review, so I wanted to try this.  I'm guessing that it won't show up much.  I happened to really like the album, although, I'm no critic, so I can't add any eloquence to my thoughts.    No real information, just the fact that out of all my CDs (100s from the past, less and less as time goes on) this one tends to get played more than the rest since I got it.
0380715430|4.0|As the title says, this book is quite informative on the origins and progression of English specifically, and to an extent, language in general. Mr. Bryson's prose ranges from informative exposition of historical facts to a flood of linguistic trivia. Rarely in this book does he linger on the vacuous, but it happens from time to time, but not for a great duration either. Overall, a highly recommended survey linguistic history book that concentrates on English.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Star Wars was my childhood. I still have the very original trilogy on VHS. My favorite edition of the trilogy was the \\"Definitive Edition\\" THX version that was released on LaserDisc some time ago. The crisp sound and picture were welcome touch-ups to the original film transfer.  <br /> <br />But apparently, \\"Definitive\\" wasn't good enough for Lucas. I admit, when I was a kid 1997, I loved the Speical Editions. But as soon as I got the VHS of the SE trilogy, I realized that what I liked about it was only the thrill of seeing the trilogy in theatres. I watched the tapes once.  Whenever I wanted to watch the triolgy, I watched my LaserDisc set. <br /> <br />If there's one thing I hate about action films today, it's the sore thumb I call CGI. It's just lazy, obvious, and inauthentic. I remember in films like Ben Hur where if a filmmaker needed thousands of people for a crowd scene, he would cast thousands of extras. I definitely prefer puppet Jabba to CGI Jabba, puppet Yoda to CGI, hopping, light-sabre dueling Yoda, and no character at all to Jar Jar Binks.  <br /> <br />The new music in Jedi is obnoxious. I can only thank God that they didn't tamper with the classic Cantina Band songs.  <br /> <br />And why does Greedo shoot first? Someone explain that to me please. I didn't want to see the Wampa and I didn't want to see the Sarlaac monster. I laughed myself silly when I heard the added scream when Luke falls after having his hand cut off. <br /> <br />But it's not like these additions make the movies bad, I would just prefer to watch the theatrical versions. The movies are still classics. Not to mention that the DVD format will be a welcome change to having to stop the movie to change the side 14 times to watch the whole trilogy on LaserDisc.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This album is absolutely beautiful. The soundclips here don't do it justice at all. This is an album that was created as an album, not a bunch of random songs thrown together. You have to listen to it from start to finish to get the full effect. It's just powerful and gorgeous, a must buy.... so buy it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Why did I like this movie?? I certianly enjoyed this movie because this world, this earth needs to understand what Jesus really went through when he died for our sins. It wasn't just 3 beatings with a wip and they put him on the cross with 3 nails. This movie shows the real thing on how Jesus, the Christ really did for us. This movie directed by Mel Gibson, actually shows in depth the Passion of the Christ. Mel Gibson (Braveheart, Lethel Weapons) did what every other director in the world wouldn't do. I give him stars for his courage. He didn't care if people mocked him for this movie. He just did whta he was going to do. He even used his own money. Back to the movie. This movie was supposed to be rated PG-13. But they rated it R because they wanted to hurt Mel. But then putting that in the pape would just let more people want to see this movie. So everything they wanted to (meaning the rating company and the media) do backfired. This movie had no graphic violence. I'm a 10 year old but I just said I'm over 13 to get on the adult rating thingy. This movie should be seen by everyone, the President, children, I mean everyone. I would rate this movie 100% good if I was allowed. This movie is a must see. And after seeing this movie think to yourself, would Budah, die for his desciples. Would you do what Jesus did. Some of you would joke around about this and say, \\"I wouldn't I have to see the Yankees win hte World Series this year but really think about it. Would you? That's all I have to say. But really think about it. God Bless!
B00005JMAH|4.0|This movie is THE BEST so far. I love Alfonso Cuaron's way of directing. Ron is even funnier than usual. The only thing that I found about it was that it was more of a teen adelosent movie than usual.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Just returned from seeing this movie.  It was one the best movies I have seen so far this year.  You have to listen to the dialogue carefully - will want to see this one again - well acted - well directed - Cruise and Foxx are at their best - didn't expect the comic dialogue - the suspense - the action - the insight into the depth of the characters is extremely well done -
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There I was at blockbuster and this movie was on sale, you know one of those two for twenty dollars specials and my kids wanted it because they 'heard' it was good. I had seen Burton's film some I would never let me kids watch, some were disappointing rememberances of awesome movies, in general though Mr. Burton had disappointed more than delivered in his past films. This time there was no way I was buying this movie without a peek, so I told my kids we would rent it. One thing led to another that evening and I found myself alone watching this movie, what the heck I thought - probably safer that way. I had somethings to do at the sametime and after 15 minutes they were left forgotten on the table. Big Fish had landed me and I was captivated by the sights and the story, before I knew it the movie was over, I felt I had learned something all over again, something I had misplaced, something that was welcome.... What was it? I am not a big fish so you will have to watch the movie for yourself and see what you find, five stars on this one for me!
B00003CXA2|3.0|A stupid is a stupid does, and Tom Hanks is stupid.
B00015YVD6|4.0|Usually when I hear &quot;an 80's comedy&quot; I really hear &quot;a silly, gross, stupid comedy&quot;...but not this time my friends, because &quot;Splash&quot; is one of the funniest films of the 1980s. You see, it really has it all: funny jokes, tender moments, romance, an intelligent script, and a very charismatic cast.  <br />  <br /> In &quot;Splash&quot; we can see a very young Tom Hanks (in his comedic period), a promising Darryl Hannah (she didn't quite reach stardom, but in this movie she is great), a hilarious John Candy (in one of his finest and funniest performances), and Eugene Levy, he plays a wacky and clueless scientist. <br />  <br /> &quot;Splash&quot; is a movie that effectively combines comedy with romance and fantasy, perhaps the movie succeeded so well because the people involved in the film were youthful and energetic, and they put their hearts in the making of &quot;Splash&quot;. This movie is highly recommendable.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This movie looks so stupid I don't even wanna see it. I'm giving it one star because it looks dumb.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|*** 1/2 stars rating for \\"Lost In Translation\\". At some point of our live, everybody have felt that sensation that despite the fact that we are surrounded by people, we feel alone. That sensation that for some reason we don't fit in a group of people or that we don't belong in a place. Those feelings of loneliness are described in \\"Lost In Translation\\".       This comedy / drama is very similar to a movie made in Hong Kong, \\"In The Mood For Love\\". In both movies we are witnesses of a relation that goes beyond the physical factor. So at least we must give to Sofia Coppola the credit for making a movie that rejects the typical elements of the romantic comedy. Her screenplay is the most rewarded aspect of the film, also, Bill Murray's performance has gathered some acting prizes as well.       \\"Lost In Translation\\" is a must seen to all the fans of the great Bill Murray, one of the finest comedians there are in these days. He gives perhaps his most mature performance to date. On the other hand we have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, a very young actress with a great future, she's only 20 years old, but she already has shown her great potential. Also, she is very beautiful and classy and she has won some awards for her performance in \\"Lost In Translation\\".      Despite all those awards, \\"Lost In Translation\\" many times gives you the feeling that is more admirable than enjoyable, it's a comedy with a lot of original and interesting situations, but sometimes the pace of the film is slow and reiterative. For those reasons \\"Lost In Translation\\" is a good movie, but some details prevent this film to be a true classic. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people that likes the \\"American Pie\\" trilogy or owns some Adam Sandler's DVDs, but I would recommend \\"Lost In Translation\\" to the audiences that love independent cinema.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE.  VINCE VAUGHN, LUKE WILSON, AND WILL FERRELL WORK JUST GREAT TOGETHER.  TO ME VINCE VAUGH IS THE FUNNIEST MAN OUT RIGHT NOW.  I KNOW A LOT WOULD DISAGREE AND SAY FERRELL IS THE FUNNIEST AND I AM OK WITH THAT BECAUSE HE IS FUNNY, BUT VAUGHN'S HUMOR IS FOR ME.  I LOVE ALL HIS MOVIES, SO WITH THE ADDITION OF FERRELL WHOM I LOVE ALSO THIS WAS A CAN'T MISS MOVIE.   <br /> <br />IT BEGINS WITH WILSON LOSING IS GIRLFRIEND ( I WONT SAY HOW) AND HE MOVES INTO WHAT ESSENTIALLY IS A FRAT HOUSE.  FERRELL HAS JUST GOTTEN MARRIED AND VAUGHN IS A RICH MARRIED WITH KIDS GUY.  WELL EVENTUALLY THEY THROW A PARTY AND END UP STARTING A FRATENITY WITH REGULAR GUYS INCLUDING, YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE, A 80 YEAR OLD GUY.  LIKE ANIMAL HOUSE THEY HAVE A DEAN TRYING TO SHUT THEM DOWN.   <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE IS HILARIOUS FROM START TO FINISH AND YOU WILL CRACK UP EVERY TIME YOU WATCH IT.  IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED, LATER \\"WE'RE GOIN STREAKIN WHOOHOOO.\\"
B00028HBKM|4.0|Finally, Mel Gibson's controversial movie &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; arrives on DVD. The film has been the generator of an impressive publicity campaign: magazines, TV, newspapers, religious and non-religious comments, you name it. However, the most interesting thing about it is that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is not your typical Hollywood biography, this is not a crowd-pleaser, the film is a risky proposal and doesn't make concessions at all. <br />  <br /> Director Mel Gibson could have made a comfortable film, with well-known superstars such as himself in the lead roles, but the main criterion to chose the actors was that their physical appearance and acting style were suitable for the essence of each role. Basically, the cast is a bunch of little-known actors (at least when the movie was filmed): Jim Caviezel as Jesus, the gorgeous Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Rosalinda Celentano as Satan and Maia Morgenstern as Mary. Most of those names didn't say too much before the release of the movie, but their performances are solid and believable. <br />  <br /> In the technical aspect &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is EXCELLENT. The costumes, the makeup, the photography, the sets, the locations are amazing, you really get the sensation that you are a witness of the real events. The photography shows beautiful landscapes that made a big contrast with the tragic scenes in the movie, a very interesting combination. The music is atmospheric and the sound effects are very real. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; visually is one of the most powerful movies ever made because there are a lot of violent scenes, most of them are so real that you can almost feel the pain and the torture, definitely this is not a movie for little children, is a movie for mature audiences. By the way, there has been a lot of criticism for Mel Gibson because some people think that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is an anti-Semitic movie, thatis, against the Jewish, but let's be objective here, the message is very clear and obvious, &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is a criticism against THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE, not against a specific community. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites everybody to reflect about our violent behavior, most of us are capable of using violent methods in order to get our own benefit. &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites us to reflect about our very own human nature. Definitely, Mel Gibson is a very, very interesting director, let's keep an eye on him, he might surprise us again, like he did with &quot;Braveheart&quot; and with &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot;.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The only reason people dont like this movie is because it doesn't have that much action. Though I thought that Kill Bill Volume One was an amazing movie that mixed a perfect blend of japenese cinema to modern cinema, I still believe that Kill Bill Volume Two was so much better. The dialogue, plot, and just the extreme emotions flying around made this film ever so much better. Also, volume one's action had basically not point. It was just, hey let's kill some people and have fun. Volume two has fight scenes that seem more personal to the main chracter. I dislike movie watchers that look at the movie genre as an action no thought thing. Watch both and keep an open mind or DIE
B00005T7I1|3.0|\\"Dick Tracy\\" is a movie that looked better in 1990, but still is entertaining and has interesting things, for instance, the production design, which makes that the movie feels like a mixture between a cartoon and a comic book. The costumes also are good, as well as the makeup. <br /> <br />The most surprising thing in \\"Dick Tracy\\" is the fact that the impressing cast (which includes great, great actors like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Paul Sorvino) portrays cartoonish characters, some of them characterized in a kinda cheesy way, however, you can tell that these great actors had a great time when they filmed \\"Dick Tracy\\", it's evident how much fun they had in the making process of the movie. <br /> <br />Warren Beatty is adequate as Dick Tracy, the main character in the movie, Beatty also was the director of \\"Dick Tracy\\". Charlie Korsmo did a good job as The Kid, who is an interesting character and he brings out the more human side of Dick Tracy, he became almost a surrogate father for the Kid. Madonna also appears in the film, and even though her musical contribution to the movie is better than her performance, her character is a key for the development of the plot. <br /> <br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" is an amusing movie, specially for those who enjoy film adaptations for comic books, or for those who saw this movie when they were kids (like myself) and feel a bit of nostalgia.
B000021YQV|5.0|I too have thought about the meaning of Chop Suey! I came up with the conclusion that the song is about the Columbine High School massacre. I know this probably isn't true but I have related each line to that possibility: <br /> <br />\\"Wake up grab a brush put on a little make up, hide the scars to fade away the shake up\\" <br />The day of the shootings the killers get up and put on their \\"make up\\" which is a metaphor for their combat gear and trenchcoats, this is their make up because it turns them into the video game characters they fantasised about being. With this gear on they are hiding the scars of being bully victims because now they are dressed in this gear they feel powerful and strong. <br /> <br />\\"Whyd you leave the keys up on the table, here you go create another fable\\" <br />They left the keys on the table because they weren't going to need them again because they were gonna die that day. Create another fable meaning they were gonna create a big news story that day that will be talked about for a long time. <br /> <br />\\"I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide\\" <br />Their suicides were self righteous because they did it to make a point. People wouldn't trust in their suicides though because people think it was pointless. <br /> <br />\\"I cry when angels deserve to die\\" <br />They proclaim themselves to be the victims because they were bullied. The people who they killed are made out to be angels but they think they deserve to die because no one cares about them being bullied.  <br /> <br />\\"Father into your hands I commend my spirit...why have you forsaken me\\" <br />They kill themselves thus giving themselves up to God's judgment but God forsakes them because they killed all those people, they are asking why because they consider themselevs to be victims also.  <br /> <br />Thats the great thing about SOAD songs you can interpret them anyway you like because they are so masked in metaphors. So KarlMarx you need to wake up & smell the coffee, SOAD are amazing, lyrically & musically. Malakian is an amazing composer and Serj writes amazing lyrics. <br />Aerials is my fave SOAD song ever, its amazing, the strings, powerful riffs, and hypnotic vocals means I never tire of hearing it. SOAD is the greatest band on earth!
B00003CXDG|3.0|&quot;Mission: Impossible 2&quot; has some of the elements that made the first &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; a good movie. For example, Tom Cruise is back in the lead role, there are cool gadgets, beautiful women, some good songs. But this movie also changes a lot of the things that resulted in a very good first movie. <br />  <br /> Obviously influenced by the blockbuster movie &quot;Matrix&quot; (1999), &quot;Mission: Impossible 2&quot; switched from the complex style of the first movie, to a very different style plagued of explosions, summersaults and martial arts. Far less interesting than the original movie, but more dynamic and spectacular, &quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot; is perfect to relax a couple of hours, but definitely it isn't an essential movie.
B00008972S|4.0|Let's face it: the Musical is a genre that the recent generations don't seem to enjoy very much, with some possible exceptions, like the more recent Films with songs and dances like &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or the Disney Films. However the classic Films of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s don't seem to appeal to the youngsters, is there a specific reason? Perhaps they think that the musicals are too dated or are old-fashioned or for older people. <br />  <br /> However, this movie &quot;West Side Story&quot;, will delight everybody. &quot;West Side Story&quot; is one of the best musicals around, a lot of people consider this movie the best of the genre, and there are a lot of reasons why this movie is considered a classic. <br />  <br /> The songs are great, the choreography is stunning, the actors / dancers are fantastic, the cinematography is flawless, the direction is almost perfect, overall this movie is very good. The story is not very complex, but that's not a bad thing because it's told very well.  <br />  <br /> I think that one of the best things about &quot;West Side Story&quot; is that the movie was one of the first movies that introduced issues like the ridiculous racial hate, the intolerance to interracial love, and the reason why some kids become members of street gangs: the lack of love of their parents, &quot;Our mothers are addicts and our fathers are drunks&quot;, claims one of the kids. And remember, this movie was released in 1961. <br />  <br /> Perhaps &quot;West Side Story&quot; has a couple of minor flaws: the running time is 151 min. Some scenes aren't very important and they go back to things that already have been established. Perhaps a 120 minutes running time could have been better. The other minor flaw (in my opinion, anyway) is that the acting sometimes feel a bit dated, but in a musical that's not the most important thing, the songs and dances are the main attractions, and in &quot;West Side Story&quot; are just great.
0790729652|4.0|Even if &quot;Superman&quot; is a decent movie, Batman is the real thing; Tim Burton created an ultra-stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the TV comedy series; in my opinion that was the right choice.<br /><br /> This film is also the best of the series; when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left this movie franchise after &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, the quality of the rest of the films was pretty poor. In &quot;Batman&quot; there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.<br /><br /> A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film.
6305313687|4.0|&quot;American History X&quot; tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a neo-nazi leader of a skinheads gang of Venice Beach, California. Derek is introduced as a racist scumbag in the first scene, when he kills a couple of black men in front of his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong); Derek is sent to prison and Danny gets so impressed with the actions of his older brother that he decides to follow his footsteps as a radical racist.  <br />  <br /> Then the movie is divided in two kind of scenes: the black and white scenes, the flashbacks, where we can see the past of Derek, his thoughts about every person which is different to a white American person, he hates black people, Jews, Mexicans, Asiatic people, etc., he just hates them all. And then are the color scenes, the present, where we see a new Derek, a reformed Derek, he is now ashamed of his racist past, and now he has to fight to save his brother of following his footsteps. <br />  <br /> &quot;American History X&quot; is not a popcorn movie; is a powerful drama with strong scenes, strong language, and a very disturbing ending; it requires an open mind because the subjects that the story introduces to us may be controversial.  <br />  <br /> Edward Norton is incredible as Derek, in this movie he offers his best performance so far, and that's saying a lot. In &quot;American History X&quot; he is as impressive as Robert De Niro was in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; or as Daniel Day-Lewis was in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;. The rest of the cast is also perfect in this movie, particularly Edward Furlong as Danny. The extras on the DVD are not very good, but one of the deleted scenes is very interesting. <br />  <br /> Perhaps &quot;American History X&quot; may offend some people, but open minded people will appreciate better this movie.
B000022TSH|5.0|&quot;Chinatown&quot; is a film packed of mystery, plot twists, suspense, incredible revelations, great performances, great direction, great storytelling, great...well, in few words, everything is great. Jack Nicholson (as J.J. Gittes) delivers one of his best performances, perhaps second only to his performance in &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;. Faye Dunaway is also pretty good as Evelyn Mulwray, and John Huston delivers an incredible performance as the corrupt water Baron Noah Cross.  <br />  <br /> The screenplay in &quot;Chinatown&quot; is amazing, you just can't stop watching this great movie, simply because you don't want to miss a single detail. Hollywood doesn't make films as good as &quot;Chinatown&quot; no more.  <br />  <br /> However, the DVD extras are mediocre, there is a standard interview, a boring trailer that doesn't reflect the true essence of the movie. But the wide-screen presentation of the film is really the reason to get the DVD, &quot;Chinatown&quot; is a must-have for any movie fan collection.  <br /> Absolutely recomendable.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|&quot;Mystic River&quot;, Clint Eastwood's most recent film, explores the dark side of the human being, that side that keeps terrible secrets and haunting memories from the past. It's a movie emotionally charged with situations that can be very dramatic, so the only way that this movie could have been well made, was counting with a good director and excellent performances. <br />  <br /> Thankfully &quot;Mystic River&quot; has an impressive cast that successfully contributed to create this complex movie. In the wrong hands, this movie could have been merely a good film. Clint Eastwood managed to get an excellent performance from everybody in this movie. From the big stars to the supporting cast, every actor in &quot;Mystic River&quot; did a terrific job. <br />  <br /> Without a doubt Sean Penn's performance in &quot;Mystic River&quot; is outstanding and he deserved every award that he got for his role of Jimmy Markum, a multi-dimensional character. Tim Robbins is excellent in his portrayal of a very dark character, a man tormented by his personal demons, and his complex performance also granted him some nominations and awards. Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Tom Guiry, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg created very human and believable characters, their performances help to get the audiences involved in the plot, making &quot;Mystic River&quot; a very interesting story from beginning to end. <br />  <br /> &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a very good movie, one of the finest of the 2003 class, and thanks to its great artistic quality, it's a very recommendable film.
6305308659|4.0|&quot;Pleasantville&quot; tells the story of David and Jennifer, a couple of teen brothers who are as different as water and oil; David (Tobey Maguire) is a shy and cool guy obsessed with a 1950's TV sitcom &quot;Pleasantville&quot;; Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) is a beautiful, popular and modern girl whose main interests are dating with boys and watch MTV. One day, an old man appears with a magical remote control, when the teens activate it, they are transported into Pleasantville, where they have to interact with the characters of the show, and everything is in black and white.  <br />  <br /> But when Jennifer brings modern life elements into the life of the old-fashioned characters, the things begin to change, every time that someone does something different, the people and things of Pleasantville change from black and white to colors. <br />  <br /> This movie is a breath of fresh air, the entire movie is very, very amusing and original. The movie makes a satire and a homage to the 1950s society at the same time. Also the movie criticizes very important issues, like the racism, the ridiculous discrimination to people who are not &quot;normal&quot;, and the exaggerated devotion to the TV. <br />  <br /> Everybody in the movie delivers a strong performance, all the cast is young and talented, it's a shame that the Academy didn't take too seriously &quot;Pleasantville&quot;. The movie is a candy for the eyes, the photography combines in a perfect way the black & white with the rest of the colors. &quot;Pleasantville&quot; is a must see.
B00003CXRP|4.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; reunites once again the awarded team Zemeckis / Hanks, and once again they made a good film. There are several remarkable aspects in &quot;Cast Away&quot;: overall the cinematography is excellent, the photography is quite realistic and Tom Hank's characterization is also great. <br />  <br /> Robert Zemeckis and William Broyles (screenwriter) showed a lot of creativity by including the lovable character &quot;Wilson&quot;, definitely a character to remember. &quot;Cast Away&quot; sometimes feels and looks so realistic that you really feel trapped in a lonely island with Tom Hanks. You will suffer along Chuck Noland (Hanks) loneliness and desperation.  <br />  <br /> Technically &quot;Cast Away&quot; is almost flawless, like all the movies directed by Robert Zemeckis, and overall the story is very good and realistic. However the movie also has weak spots: Helen Hunt is misused in a very lackluster role to Helen's standards. The first half hour of the movie elapses with few highlights, and the last half hour is kinda disappointing.  <br />  <br /> At the end of the day, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a worthy movie. Specially for Tom Hanks' fans or Robert Zemeckis' fans.
6305308659|4.0|I found this to be quite a Satanic film to consider in that it focuses on a McCarthyistic / Rockwellian environment, with its residents being virtual clones in a black and white world in dualism, remaining pleasantly ignorant of anything ouside the fetters therein.<br /><br />A fan named David of a program named \\"Pleasantville\\" gets paid a visit by an unassuming, though a bit meddling TV repairman {Don Knotts} who observes his passion and extensve trivia of the show, thereby zapping him and his sister into the Letharginator turned virtual time portal, wgere they arrive in the quaint little towne complete with period clothing to match, and a remote controller whch now has the power to transport them back through the letharginatrix when desired.<br /><br />They are warned not to interfere with the goings-on, but to to only basque in the charming simplicities of the time. But little by little, gems of knowledge are released to the Pleasantvillians, to which an interesting enigma occurs - they begin to acquire COLOR - the more wordly knowledge that is accumulated, the more colorful the town and the people become; until this eventually causes a rift between the black-white civilians and the \\"colords\\".<br /><br />Knotts notices the changes from the future, admonishing that they make a hasty return, but David is determned to remain as a veritable Lucifer enlightening the polulace, along with his sister Jennifer, who decides to become quite the succubus, to the delights of the flesh of the world, of the mind and the emotions, and the fortunate young men she chooses to bestow her beauty.<br /><br />Of note, the relationship between David and the cook at the local soda shoppe, who in the beginning would not even close up shop without the help of his little waiter-friend, but who begins nurturing his talent for art, as Davis presents him with a vertiable \\"forbidden book\\", which sparks an inferno of motivation; so much so, that he begins persuing his bliss agressively, making up for all that lost time when he was only allowed to draw one different painting per holiday season on the front window of the shop. And now, the place becomes strewn with paintings, although most of them are portrits of David's mother, whom he has been infatuated with for a long time - and there is a very interesting story behind that as well. She too has acquired color, by both persuing her reciprocal infatuation with the artist, and finally experiencing an ORGASM - it seems as if the residents were not even aware of coitus much less masturbation - they didn't even defecate!<br /><br />The ignorant populace subsequently become rousted when a new mural on the soda shoppe is spotted - that of a semi-clad David's mother in all of her elegant beauty. The grey-scale cretins smash it to bits and vandalize the shop for his creative efforts. Still, he follows his heart and eventually creates another masterpiece, this time on the side-wall of the place, which pictorally recounts the unfortunate occurrences as of late, most noticably, the despicable burning of books which are depicted sprouting wings and flying up into the sky like so many angels. This was cause by David and his sister recalling the contents of certain literature in the librarium, to which the predictable blank pages in the myriad tomes begin to fill by the recollections of their memories.<br /><br />Of course, because of the various labidonous and epystomological expressions thus surfacing in the once completely bland township, the politicians amongst the greyscale drones mobilize against the evolutions by passing restrictive laws to squelch all future manifestations of the imagination, until the mural incident, in which the artist is called into Court, where there is one judge, no jury, and the attendents therein are divided between the greys and the colords. David must act as his own and the cook's attorney until finally, he invokes a response emotional enough to surface color in the Judge himself, to which he goes out running amidst the laughter of all in the hall.<br /><br />After this, the toen is in brilliant Satan-O-Vision color, as if painted by the hands of daemons. So David finally returns, and all is as it was in his own time, with an additional kaleidoscopic flame of knowledge to boot.imself, to which he goes out running amidst the laughter of all in the hall.  <br /> <br />After this, the toen is in brilliant Satan-O-Vision color, as if painted by the hands of daemons.

6305949980|5.0|Into the wonderfully enchanted world of Halloweentown, set on the edge of reality, where your nightmares and dreams live in joyful celebration of the dark and morbid, but in a perpetually playful rapport. Two holidays collide by the curiosity of Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, who grows weary of the redundancy of his role, although he always manages to invent something scarier each Halloween than the previous year's. Amidst a fanfare of admirers singing the wonderfully evocative and enchanting \\"This Is Halloween\\". He arises to take his seat as the fearful Lord of Samhain unto a cavalcade of vampires, werewolves, witches, zombies skeletons, swamp creatures, devils, ghosts, and miscellanious beings, who all herald him as their leader. His depression leads him to explore the unknown in an enchanted forest, where he discovers trees which are essentially doors into the differing holidays' worlds he finds Christmas Town, and remains fascinated by all the shiney baubles and quaint customs until he finally sees the shadow of Santa \\"Claws\\", which intrigues him even more. He tells the residents of his adventures, describing SC as a huge being with \\"bulging sacks and big great arms\\" who \\"sets to slay with his reindeer on\\", and introduces the novel idea of celebrating Christmas in Halloweentown, at which the residents are enthusiastic, but keeping to their natures, transform it into a nightmare of sorts, replicating the traditions with Halloween prankery.<br /><br />Jack sets out to BECOME Santa Claws fir a year, delivering the nefarious gifts to unsuspecting commoners, who receive quite a fright when their presents begin chasing them and eating up their homes. Just splendid. Finally, the military becomes alerted, and he is shot out of the sky, landing in a graveyard, where he focuses himself and becomes determined to \\"set things right\\". Underlying all of this, there is a romantic element between Jack and Sally, a pretty zombie-like character, reminiscient of a sexy bride of Frankentein-type without the electric-shock hair, who aids Jack throughout the whole tale. In one poignant moment, as she ponders the wonder of the xmas tree, it erupts into flames, which serves as an omen fortelling of impending doom; she tries to warn Jack againmst venturing forth as St. Nick, but his determination grabbed the best of him.<br /><br />Santa is kidnapped by \\"Lock, Shock, & Barrel\\", the three trick or treating underlings of \\"Mr. Oogie Boogie\\", and in one instance, actually accidently bunny-nap the Easter Bunny! Eventually, Jack confronts Oogie Boogie in his lambent Lair which appears to be a Hellish Casino, until distracted by the curvy leg of Sally. Santa is scheduled to be chopped up into so much xmas mulch, until rescued by the heroic efforts of Jack. Finally, Santa is released, and Christmas is saved thanks to The Pumpkin King.<br /><br />The musick in this production is scored by Danny Elfman, Satanic Composer Extraordinnaire, is most excellent, incorperating many of the characters from Halloween legend, most wonderfully achieved. The puppetry is remarkable, and lends an evocation towards older productions from the 40's through to the 60's in whjich one might expect Bing Crosby to be crooning; this certainly is a welcomed utilization of a past orthodoxy. Most highly recommended for Infernal Progeny - quite an alternative to the charming, yet redundant productions usually available in the Yuletide season.<br /><br />Moral of the story? Do not attempt to be something you are not.<br /><br />__________________<br /><br />* The Special Addition version also contains two of Tim Burton's earlier films: 'Frankenweenie' and 'Vincent':<br /><br />FRANKENWEENIE<br /><br />Set in contemporary suburbia, young Victor Frankenstein happily plays with his aptly named bull terrier \\"Sparky\\", when the tragic happens... the spunky pooch is hit and killed by a car.

Under the suspciious gaze of a neighbor, he gathers the necessary equipment from the garage, and sneaks out to the pet cemetary to disinterr the pup, anxiously awaiting the next storm to arrive, which is fortunately within a couple night's time.<br /><br />Predictably, after studying through several books on the subject, he actually manages to revivify Sparky, who now resembles a patchwork puppy, bolts, scars, and all. Joyful to be reunited with eachother, all seems well until Sparky decides to run amok through the neighborhood, although most of the panic is due to the hysterical nature of a neightbor lady and a whining little girl.<br /><br />When his parents realize that Sparky is actually alive again, they accept his return from the grave, welcoming him back to the family.

B00006F2TV|5.0|From the pages of comic book legend, another hero materializes into the third dimension to ooh and ahh the masses with super-human abilities, to wish for a super hero in such proportions of terrorist pre-occupation. And indeed, the war propaganda was made evident in the closing scene where the webslinger was perched atop a flag pole demonstrating Olde Glory, which received a few handclaps of approval from the audience.<br /><br />Besides this, I was accompanied by some friends to accompany them to this film - so being that I have had an affinity for the webhead since a Dracling, I decided to go. Rememberences of going to the corner store picking up copies of The Amazing Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, X-men, any of the Draculas I could find; and there was even a time when I went through a Superman phase {Note: Superman was actually inspired by the ideologies of Friederich Nietchzie, in his philosophies of the \\"Ubermenchten\\" or \\"Overman\\" / \\"superman\\"}; so it afforded Me particular interest to view this film.<br /><br />Sam Raimi {The Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman} kept as close to the story as possible, so as to not disappoint discerning Spidey fans with minor modifications {such as the spider which bit Peter Parker was actually a mutated clone, which seems more timely, whereas the original story related that it was a radio-active spider}, yet these small changes do not really distract from the overall wonder of the character. CGI technology has advanced to the point where the spider stunts can now be brought into the 3D realm, whereas prevoiusly, Spiderman presentations were primarily relegated to either pure animation, or when actually using an actor, as on the short-lived television series, certain shots were made from a distance and whatnot, although that presentation seemed to have more of an air of believability, only because stuntmen were used more frequently.<br /><br />The only contention this writer had, was with the CGI in this particular presentation; was in the kinematics of the fluency of the character during swinging sequences, which was just a bit too animatronic. Yet again, these are small details that can be overlooked for the overall super hero drama of The Amazing Spiderman.<br /><br />Raimi also decided to use the original portrayal of web shooting directly from Spiderman's wrists, rather than from the eventual web-shooters added in subsequent evolutions of The Spiderman Saga.<br /><br />The Green Goblin {William Defoe} was quie impressive as well; the product of experimental radiation, he in encased in sinister armor bearing a demonic rictus, wihch also serves as a mirror / doorway to his dark subconscious in which his diabolical personality split speak to him in 360*, which gives the impression of possession; but the higher man wouls realize this as one's collective dark-side consciosness of the brain's expression of possiblities.<br /><br />The Prodicer decided to use a mask instead of the anthropomorphic face used int he comic book scenario, and for these purposes, I think it worked quite well. The goblin mask represents an archetype of villainy, and in this Satanist's opinion, is well-hewn.<br /><br />Of note, the Mary-Jane Watson character {who is a ditz in real life}, in one remarkable scene, during a kiss sequence she shares with the webslinger, the outline of her nipples and breasts are revelaed drenched in the rain underneath a white blouse - which was quite a delightful surprise, really.<br /><br />There is a touching scene with Peter's uncle really tugs at the heart-strings, in which he was shot by a mugger who exited the very same event Parker was wrestling at, even brushing past him in a getaway, stealing from an unscrupulous promoter {spidey fans will be very familiar with these events} - both the promoter and the thief receive dark justice.<br /><br />Overall, this film is definitely recommended for the Spiderman fan, who should not be disappointed; and for those new to the homosapien-arachnid's lore, this will prove to be a worthy introduction.homosapien-arachnid's lore, this will prove to be a worthy introduction.
B000286S8S|5.0|Van Halen's back, and they've kicked off their return with a remastered collection of all their most popular songs. One of the only 80's bands to survive the grunge movement, Van Halen broke up just as their crossover appeal was exploding, leaving Aerosmith to take their place as the band 90's kids could listen to when they didn't feel like moping along with Kurt Cobain and company. This 2-disc set plays like a Van Halen fan's perfect driving tape. After the obvious album starter, Eddie Van Halen's legendary solo \\"Eruption\\", the album debuts the first new songs since their reunion with Sammy Hagar on the microphone. \\"It's About Time\\" is one big wink to the fans, an apology for being gone so long. Musically, it's in the same vein as \\"Top Of The World\\", and \\"Runaround\\". Next up is \\"Up For Breakfast\\", an anthem for the glory of morning sex. The thinly-veiled food innuendo (handled more tactfully, and cleverly than David Lee Roth's \\"Hot Dog and a Shake\\") and surprisingly heavy guitar work is enough to make any heterosexual that's gone through puberty grin. \\"Learning To See\\" rounds out the new songs, as the required ballad. <br /> <br />What follows is non-stop Van Halen hits (the number of which, when seen all together in this compilation is staggering). Standout tracks are \\"Dreams\\" (the song you've heard at every air show you've ever been to right after they played The Scorpions' \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\"), \\"Hot For Teacher\\" (the best example of David Lee Roth's always-entertaining lyrics and party-starting vibe), \\"Right Now\\", \\"Panama\\", Dance The Night Away\\" (my favorite song of all time), and \\"When It's Love\\". The number of tracks may be intimidating to newcomers, but a quick listen to the album will have anyone who's turned on rock radio since 1978 saying \\"oh my god! Thay wrote that?!\\". Older fans will be re-living the days when songs had guitar solos and David Lee Roth had hair.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Although this series was one of the best sequel and prequel mixes ever I think that the final battle left us wanting much more. I loved Tarentino's optimal use of his actors playing multi roles (Gordon Liu & Michael Parks) Thier make up and talent along with Tarentino's directing genus make this series one of the best that has ever been attempted. The only one to equal or surpass would be the \\"Star Wars\\" Saga.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Robert Altman's GOSFORD PARK was a critics' darling when it was released and even copped an Oscar for Julian Fellowes' screenplay.  I found the whole product rather trifling and dull, myself.  When the murder finally happens (well over an hour into the movie), it's so quick and unexciting, it's meaningless.  Meanwhile the overrated Altman lets his excellent cast wander around the estate, speaking in such thick accents, much of their dialogue is undecipherable.  There are so many characters that one needs a scorecard to keep up with who's with who and how they relate to each other.  Altman did do a fine job in capturing the look and feel of 1937 England, and Patrick Doyle's score is affective.  The cast has some marvelous performances, particularly by Maggie Smith as the gossipy down and out countess; Derek Jacobi as one of the faithful valets; Eileen Atkins and Helen Mirren, as sister servants with dark secrets; Alan Bates as the head master of the valets, and Michael Gambon as the doomed head of the household.  Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Clive Owen give marginally good performances, no vitality though.  And Ryan Phillipe is very, very uneffective in his role as the masquerading valet.<br /><br />GOSFORD PARK is a stylish but vacant movie, leaving me wanting more from less characters and subplots.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Finally, a Harry Potter film which transports that special spark one feels from reading the books, to the silver screen.  By far and away, one of the most moving, powerful chidren's films ever made.   <br /> <br />The qualities that make the books unique and amazing are fully present in this adaptation.  The mature reworking of the themes of loss, memory, time, and the depth of emotion underscoring the thrilling storytelling, are all here.  The cinematography and editing are spectacular: they capture on film what I envisioned in my mind as I read the book, which rarely happens with film adaptations of great literature.  The visually ravishing imagery, with it's muted yet sparkling tones of silver, green and deep blues, the lush outdoor settings coupled with the mundane, the existence of magic as an organic element of the action rather than a self-conscious attempt to wow us, (as in the Columbus-directed installments), should be used as a blueprint for the rest of the series, as it springs directly from the emotional tone of the book.  The use of widescreen framing to capture the epic scope of the story, and the excellent moving camerawork, placing the characters within a realistic yet otherworldly context, shows just how much Cuaron connected with this material and took it to heart.  Even the way closeups are worked into subtly, and earned dramatically, rather than liberally sprinkled throughout the action to underscore what the imagery should have told us already, was perfectly done.   <br /> <br />Cuaron clearly understands kids, and he vividly remembers that terrifying, and as Mavis Jukes, a well-respected children's author in her own right, commented, magical moment when we learn that we CAN face all those frightening things that await us in our future, that we can face ANYTHING that comes our way, and that we must find that the power, the power to overcome, lives inside us, and not inside another.  There are few moments in film as deeply moving, heartbreaking yet uplifting, as the moment when Harry realizes that his dead father will not come to save him, and he conjures the Patronus to save his own life and that of his godfather, discovering that he's much more powerful a wizard, and human being, than he ever thought possible.  Whatever else was missing from the book in the film, Cuaron couldn't have realized the intentions of the source material any better than he did, and Rowling acknowledged that when she said that this film was her favorite of the three.   <br /> <br />Radcliffe, and his costars, have improved dramatically as actors as well, which helps tremendously, and I think having a truly competent, innovative director, (one who elicited amazing performances out of the children in his captivating adaptation of A LITTLE PRINCESS), was just what was needed to bring all these kids forward artistically.  Had Columbus directed this film, we could have expected only perfunctory performances.  Cuaron knows how to get his actors to connect emotionally with the material, and Columbus has never had that talent.  Witness Radcliffe's particularly impressive improvements in the scene in Lupin's office where he attempts to conjure a happy memory powerful enough to repel the Boggart-Dementor.  It's an astonishing accomplishment for such a young actor, and helps us to believe that he will further amaze us in the incredibly difficult and intense emotional scenes to come in the film versions of both GOBLET OF FIRE and THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. <br /> <br />All in all, this film was a great experience; deeply felt, emotionally satisfying, and still a thrilling adventure of a story.  Let's hope Cuaron comes back to make another Harry Potter film before the series is through!
B00004RITP|5.0|This is one of the best recordings of Mahler's 10th ever made. Really red blooded performance, generally slow tempi (but not boring of course because very controlled), very good sound quality. As you know, this is the best completion of this \\"sketched\\" symphony. I impressed especially with 1st Adagio and 5th Finale movement. In the last minutes of Adagio, there are very dissonance (but they're very amazing) chords, nearly atonal, and they're spine-chilling (this passages comes again in Finale). There are 2 scherzos, which the first is unregulared rhytms, the second is the ghostly, devilish fast waltz. And the finale is terrific (starts with the bass drum strokes which \\"death blows\\") and then really Mahlerian tempestous Allegro and as like the first mov. again Adagio and heavenly and calm conclusion. Simon Rattle (who may be conducted this symphony over 100 times) is clearly one of the best performer of this work, comparable with Eugene Ormandy and Mark Wigglesworh's (on a BBC broadcast) versions.     It is an essential recording and highly recommended for any classical music lovers.
1400049628|4.0|the book is good for what it's worth. just don't take it seriously, everyone watching you read it will think you're crazy. i like the book cause i love zombie movies, but it was somewhat inconsistant. such as it's review of a crossbow for a legitimate weapon(negative), and later telling you to bring one because of it's light weight. some would hate it because of that, i just figure he was trying to tell you to just use what ever the hell you find. the book can be interesting to pass the time with
B000001DQI|5.0|One of the most famous records in rock history, Elton John's 1973 album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road represents the pinnacle of Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin's ascent of the ladder of \\"success\\". It was a record that saw Elton's 6-year solo career peak commercially (the album was a #1 hit almost everywhere simultaneously in late 1973) but also critically - people were genuinely excited, moved and inspired by the songs on this collection then as now, and rock critics at the time praised Goodbye... as the ultimate Elton John collection. Although its 17 songs cover a diverse range of styles and subjects, there is a general sense of the album being part of the entertainment industry \\"dream machine\\" -that is , the songs are somewhat idealised, even romanticised snapshots of life as seen through the eyes of Elton and Bernie (two unabashed fans of modern, chiefly American, popular culture). Here, references to TV, film and pop culture abound - from the album's cover, which shows a satin-clad Elton stepping through a cartoon bill poster into a fantasyland depicting the fabled Yellow Brick Road from the beloved L. Frank Baum Tales of Oz stories. This sets the mood of the album.  <br /> <br />The 17 songs include some of his greatest ones. I'll start with the terrific opening track : Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding. This is an inspired piece of music. What a surprise it must have been to have been an avid Elton fan in 1973, and to have spun this track for the first time - it is an 11-minute merger of an elegiac synth-keyboard instrumental with a rousing, rocking tale of the vagaries of the rock n' roll lifestyle, interspersed with driving guitar ,exciting choruses and a truly memorable coda. Everybody knows the song Candle In The Wind - it is a sensitive ballad about the tragic celebrity Marilyn Monroe. Despite its well-knownness, this song never fails to move me. Then we have Bennie And The Jets, a fun, escapist sort of song backed with \\"live\\" crowd noise dubbed in the studio. This was apt - it is a track that works very well live in concert (better than as the studio version) and gives Elton free rein to display his extravagant piano-playing talents and showmanship. It's about a space-age female glam rock band!! Track 4 is the album's title tune - another great standard that features high harmony vocals, classic choruses and wonderful strings arranged by Del Newman (successor to original Elton album arranger Paul Buckmaster). At this point, we've only listened to one side of the 4 original vinyl LP sides and it's 4 classics in a row!! <br /> <br />This Song Has No Title is OK. Grey Seal is an interesting inclusion as you can hear the difference between the original 1970 version of this lyrically-intriguing song (which was an early B-side) and this fast, rocking version. The biggest difference between the two is Elton's vocal persona - here he is much more extroverted and flamboyant than he was in 1970, and he kicks this song into overdrive on the fadeout. The choice of the Caribbean to record the album (when things got tricky there, the players all decamped back to the Honky Chateau to finish the job) may have influenced the jaunty reggae rhythms of the lighthearted Jamaica Jerk-Off. The quiet, orchestrated ballad I've Seen That Movie Too was about betrayal, and closed the first half of the record on a sombre but impressive note. <br /> <br />Sweet Painted Lady is frankly about prostitutes in a seaside port, and is a languid tune. All The Young Girls Love Alice is also about one particular lonely \\"naughty girl\\" whose search for happiness ends in a sordid subway demise. This track really works well -it has a rocking intro, tempo changes, and a dramatic coda, with overlaid sound effects of sirens , noises etc. representing the protagonist's sad exit. Dirty Little Girl threatens to turn this side 3 into a catalogue of misogyny as it deals with an unclean \\"lower socio-economic\\" lady. Social Disease is sort of down at this stratum of society too - the character in the song is a lazy alcoholic good-for-nothing!! Bernie was obviously in an ornery frame of mind when he penned the lyrics for this part of the album!!  <br /> <br />Whimsical nostalgia is represented by the slow country-styled tune Roy Rogers. I'm too young to have grown up with Cowboys and Indians on TV and Westerns and the Lone Ranger etc, but clearly these TV shows had a profound impact on people of Elton and Bernie's generation growing up in the 50's, so this would have meant a lot to 1973's record buyers. A real treasure here is the beautiful song Harmony. It did not become a hit, but as Elton says himself on the Classic Albums DVD that celebrated the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album in 2002, it was one of the best things on the album. It has, appropriately, wonderful harmonies and the classic Elton John chorus sound created by overdubbing backing vocals performed by the Elton John Band (Dee Murray, Nigel Olsson and Davey Johnstone).  <br /> <br />The teenage pandemonium caused by Rocking Elton on his previous LP Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player was represented here by the showbizzy little rocker Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock And Roll), which sounds like a sequel to Crocodile Rock. It then leads into Elton's best-ever rock vocal performance on the tremendous Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting). This was one of those rock 'n roll songs where the players threw everything into the performance, holding nothing back. Elton's vocal sounds raw and he yells out the choruses in a way that he never would have tried doing earlier in his recording career while some of his early bashfulness remained. It is really exciting, and works well as a concert staple, often closing sets (particularly on a Saturday!)  <br /> <br />The remastered CD has no bonus tracks owing to lack of space on the CD - the album out-takes /B-sides ended up on Don't Shoot Me... remastered edition instead. <br /> <br />A 5-star Classic Album if ever there was one!!

B0001L3LUE|4.0|The Fog of War is a compelling documentary about the life of Robert McNamara (generally) and of the Vietnam War specifically. The documentary segments the film into eleven \\"lessons,\\" most, unfortunately, are too banal to be accurately described as lessons. (\\"You can't change human nature\\"--no kidding.) <br /> <br />That said, the documentary is otherwise outstanding, comparing both McNamara's early life and its culmination as his seven years as Secretary of Defense. Not all of it would, under normal circumstances, seem to be intertwined, and yet you feel that his time at Ford at least in some way affected the later decisions made. <br /> <br />There are many dimensions to this film: we can see, on the base, the archived information presented in an informative, rather than dry, manner, such as the tapes from both Kennedy and Johnson. This supports with McNamara's commentary, rather than presenting nuggets of long-ago recorded conversations and work McNamara around it. McNamara himself is surprisingly lucid given his age. Alas, as the focus of the documentary, there's little in the way of competing arguments, but McNamara has been forthright in his decisions (in his book, \\"In Retrospect,\\" among other forums) so he has little incentive to be elusive. <br /> <br />This movie, along with its eerie score, is worthy of watching by anyone--those ignorant of Cold War politics, those who lived in the turmoil of the time, and those who are slightly informed about the Vietnam War and would like to see significantly more depth without being bored. While the documentary can be a bit too proud of its own cleverness-interposing Japanese cities with American cities of comparable size along with death rates is clever, but not repeated 40 times-there's a lot more positive to it than negative. <br />
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is a great mix of Hollywood comedy and independent drama. It works because of Bill Murray's terrific comedic performance, and Scarlett Johansonn's role as suffering wife to Giovanni Ribisi (who has yet to give a bad performance). The film can get tedious at times, especially during a second viewing, but it all depends on taste. I am amazed at some of the bad reviews for this though, because it is well-made and funny, albeit not hilarious.  <br /> <br />Lost in Translation is a sometimes funny, often poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human and finding yourself. It is definitely different from most films and those looking for a typical Bill Murray comedy should look elsewhere. This is a touching and beautiful portrait of a romance that could never be, with real characters, not cardboard cut-outs. Perhaps that's what turns most people off, because God forbid they see some of themselves in a film character. I loved this film, my date admired it and was 'wowed.' Love it or hate it, Lost in Translation is a good film worth viewing at least once.  <br />

B00008PRR9|5.0|`A Quick One' is an expansion of the English LP which was released in the United States as `Happy Jack', with, as was the practice at the time with all English acts like The Who, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones, fewer cuts than the comparable English release. These cuts represent The Who at the height of their Mod period, as in `Mods and Rockers', two fashion factions prominent in London in the mid 1960's. The Stones, I believe, were the darlings of the Rockers.<br /><br />Even in this early, first widely successful album, all of Townsend's songwriting subjects and directions which flowered with `Tommy' and `Quadrophenia' are present. The title cut, `A Quick One, While He's Away' is a little story which parallels the beginning of `Tommy', where a male lover is missing and the grieving woman takes solace with another companion. Gladly, this story has a much happier ending. The title cut of the American release, `Happy Jack', is another common Townsend theme, where an odd youngster is victimized by chums / family / colleagues (pick one) yet survives with good cheer, buoyed up by some inner strength (sound familiar?). Even John Entwistle's French horn, so prominent a feature of `Tommy' is here.<br /><br />Like all of The Who albums through `Who's Next', after which Keith Moon dies prematurely, the album is clearly a collaboration of four talents rather than being merely Pete Townsend's band. The liner notes give a monetary explanation for why all band members contributed songs to the album, but the end result is a much richer mix of material than simply being a Townsend songbook. Entwistle contributes his usually dark subjects, headlined by `Boris the Spider', making me wonder how he knew the name of the spider was `Boris'. Of all the British Invasion bands, it always struck me that The Who did a lot more of their share of novelty songs, more than anyone except those groups such as the Bonzo Dog Doo Wah Band who specialized in comedy songs.<br /><br />The album also contains three covers of songs by American writers; however, these works seem to show that The Who are much less influenced by American styles than they are by the native British skittles and music hall traditions. One odd presence is the performance of the `Batman' theme from the American television program. This show must have been at least as popular in the UK as it was in the US, as the Kinks also performed and recorded this tune at about the same time.<br /><br />This album doesn't have the cohesion of `The Who Sell Out', `Tommy', or `Quadrophenia' or the great power of  `Who's Next', but it shows the continuity of themes and style in the music of `The Who' from their early popularity onward.<br /><br />This album confirms my belief that there is not one original `The Who' album which is not worth having if you have the least bit of fondness for their music. I withhold general judgement for re-released material in after the fact `best of' compilations.<br /><br />Great early stuff from one of the true legends of rock and roll.

B00005JNEI|1.0|This film illustrates what is wrong with this country.  I am a big beleiver in freedom of speech, but you don't yell, \\"Fire\\" in a crowded movie theater when it is a LIE.<br /><br />  Anyone can make a film or \\"documentary\\" and by editing and splicing things together make it appear how you want it to be.  Hell, I could use the same methods as Moore and make a documentary with film clips, and interviews, and make Adolf Hitler look like a philanthropist deserving the Nobel Peace Prize. Show the good and edit out the bad, or in Moore's case, make it look bad, and edit out the good.<br /><br />  This fillm is not a true and fair representation of the Bush administration.  That is what is polarizing this country, the half truths, and down right lies that are put forth as fact.<br /><br />  Maybe the terrorists of 9/11 have already won.  Look at the polling numbers, nearly 50-50 right down the middle...DIVIDE AND CONQUER.  I'd like to thank Mr. Moore for his little contribution to the effort.
B0002858YS|5.0|This cd is one of the best I've bought in a long long time.  Every song is amazing and deserves to be played over and over.  \\"Smile,\\"  reminds me a lot of the Cure.  The lyrics are awesome and draw you in.  Each song seems to have a little surprise, like in \\"All These Things That I've Done,\\" the gospel sound, or the horns in \\"Believe Me Natalie.\\"  I haven't stopped listening to this cd since I bought it, when I'm running, driving, and even falling asleep to it.  If you buy one cd this year, make it this one, it's on sale everywhere and The Killers may just be the next big thing.
B000001E7L|5.0|I remember buying this CD when it first came out. They played the  openning song \\"Ode To My Family\\" on MTV every day and I loved it. Today, this is one of the best albums in my collection. Every song in it brings forth an emotion that touches something inside me. This album is Delores O'Riordan singing her heart, backed by enchantingly beautiful guitar riffs in every song. <br /> <br />For me, this album is dark and depressing, but that is also why I describe it as being beautiful and real. This album is like a black and white photograph, reminding ourselves of the sad reality we sometimes experience in our own lives and in those around us. <br /> <br />Buy this album and hear it for yourself. Years from now you will still put this CD into your CD player because it is simply a timeless masterpiece.
B00005B36H|4.0|Well what can i write that hasnt been written by literally hundreds of reviewers before me? Ill just share my personal experience, I love Tool, i own anemia but i ended  up downloading most of the tracks from Lateralus, downloading with a band like tool doenst make sense, they make true albums that have a mood from start to finish and this is one of the few cd's that I can play from start to finish, this is not to say that they arent any songs i cannot get into (2 actually) but the album is absolutely brilliant. Its more mellow and introspective that earlier tool, and this is tool at their creative peak. Elements of psychdelica and ambience are blended in to great effect and the lyrics sound as if Maynard has either gone to therapy,worked out some of his demons or fallen in a love a bit. This is a more mature tool. The sounds quality of this album is A+, it was obviously recorded in DDD, and its an HDCD as well. It has lost a bit off the bass end than anemia, but it totally makes up in the midrange and treble, the cymbals and drums are recorded perfectly, in fact, i have never heard drums sound better. This is one of the albums that (with a decent system) it sounds like you are listening to them right in front of you, rather than to a mere cd. Tool really should release their stuff in super audio and dvd audio, it'll do the sound justice, but this is plenty fine. I really love this album and if you like tool or any other good music, buy this...you wont be disappointed.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Another gem from Michael Moore.  This documentary makes a gutsy and convincing case for a change in administration this November.  A must see documentary in this political season, regardless of your political persuasion.  Before going to the polls, the electorate needs an incisive review of a candidate's job performance - particulary the incumbent's.  (After all, this election is as much a referendum on the incumbent president as it is about the challenger.)  This documentary offers a perspective that the mainstream news media - most of the time manipulated to be mouthpieces of political candidates by the respective campaigns - will not cover.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's debut album, \\"In Utero\\" was a complete disasterpiece and banned from the media for it's blantant display of ripping off the more talented Puddle Of Mudd. You'd think these guys would learn that copying superior bands is not the way to success, and that everyone hates you for doing so, but I guess these guys just can't get a clue. They are back with their most popular album, \\"Nevermind\\". It immideantly created loads of controvery due to the fact that it had a naked baby on it (something Puddle of Mudd had already done before with their album \\"Come Clean\\". That's just great! First they rip off the sound of POM, now they're ripping off the album covers too!). <br /> <br />This album wasn't as successful as their debut, and they once again were banned from mainstream play, due to the fact that everyone thought Nirvana vocalist Kirk Konami was some kind of pedophile. So, if you are a die-hard fan of Puddle of Mudd and simply must have something similar before they release their next 5-star album, then get this imitation. But good luck finding it...they successfully banned this thing in the United States.
0425180638|3.0|The story was filled with information, but never reached a resolution -- and this book should have brought a decisive conclusion for the questions that were brought up in Point of Origin and added to in Black Notice.   <br /> <br />The story was engrossing, but the copious rehash of the same clues and similar ones used in Black Notice, and the gratituous torture murders simply made it long.  The story is still not wrapped up.  Why were the murder / tortures even included? <br /> <br />Whether the next book will resolve the crimes, criminals, and unearth significant details is the question.  The serious problem is that I don't trust Patricia Cornwell to finish a story started in Point of Origin. <br /> <br />Because I hoped for the conclusion, I kept reading, and her style did cature me.  So that gives the book a few stars.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I used to be a huge fan of real punk acts like Black Flag (Rollins rules), The Misfits, Bad Religeon, and The Ramones. It absolutely disgusted me to see these poser pop-punk acts like Sum 41, Blink 182 (what's with all the numbered bands?), Simple Plan 24, and Green Day 148. That's why I was so happy to see the return of real punk like Avril Lavigne becoming popular in the mainstream. It was amazing how hardcore this punk was, and it was even more amazing hearing it coming from a female! This woman doesn't care about record sales and refuses to alter her style for MTV or any other mainstream network. This wild attitude has even gotten a few of her videos banned, which only made people like her more!  <br /> <br />It makes me mad to see so many people give this a low rating, but I really can't blame them since they've never been exposed to real punk before. They fear what they don't understand. I must say, Avril is probably the best punk rocker around. Let me just ask you a quick question: Who would you rather see? Henry Rollins dancing around on stage bare-foot and showing his pecks to everyone, or a beautiful girl like Avril singing her heart out and removing the steriotype that \\"punk is just for men\\"? Yes, I know you chose Avril. That's what I thought.
B00028HBKM|1.0|If I could rate this zero stars I would. A totally perverted view of the Story of Christ. A base film that totally panders to a bloodthirsty audience with short attention spans.   It's no wonder it was a hit. It offers nothing of the teachings of Christ to a novice. If you want to see a moving well made version of this story, seek out Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew. Gibson is laughing all the way to the bank! <br />
B00008H2LB|5.0|Wow, this album certainly isn't for those that don't like heavy metal. The screaming was pretty loud, and this kind of music is only for those that like extremely heavy stuff. In fact, this album is probably the heaviest thing my ears have ever heard. All you Britney fans better watch it! This will be too heavy for your ears to take! LP's last album successfully mixed thrash and hardcore rap, but they're going with a more death metal style for this one. This is certainly better than poser death metal like Napalm Death. I mean, those guys haven't even been on TRL (If you've never been on TRL, you are not good!)!
B000089RVX|2.0|Amy Lee has a very good voice. That being said there's nothing else to like about the album. The riffs are unimaginative and boring, the drumming sucks and their attempt to add some variety with piano ballads fails miserably. Of course as we've all seen over the past few years this formula of sucking is a sure way to sell millions of records. Hell, I think the worst album ever, St. Anger was a bestseller around the time this was. I won't chastise all you mainstream fans like a lot of people, I'll just give my opinion. Evanscence have a good song or two but overall aren't very good. Dying your hair black and putting on some makeup does not make you \\"gothic\\". Ripping off other nu-metal bands who ripped off some other band who ripped another band does not make you a talented artist. If you want to get into some real \\"gothic\\" bands check out Tiamat, Cradle of Filth, Paradise Lost, or Agathodaimon. If you want some bands that are female fronted that are way better than this check out Alas, Lacuna Coil, the Gathering, Brave, Within Temptation, Nightwish, Rhea's Obsession, ...How Like A Winter, Draconian, Darzamat, Otep, Leave's Eyes, Arch Enemy, Tristania, Persphone, Theatre of Tradgedy, Sirenia, or Trail of Tears.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's debut album, \\"In Utero\\" was a complete disasterpiece and banned from the media for it's blantant display of ripping off the more talented Puddle Of Mudd. You'd think these guys would learn that copying superior bands is not the way to success, and that everyone hates you for doing so, but I guess these guys just can't get a clue. They are back with their most popular album, \\"Nevermind\\". It immideantly created loads of controvery due to the fact that it had a naked baby on it (something Puddle of Mudd had already done before with their album \\"Come Clean\\". That's just great! First they rip off the sound of POM, now they're ripping off the album covers too!). <br /> <br />This album wasn't as successful as their debut, and they once again were banned from mainstream play, due to the fact that everyone thought Nirvana vocalist Kirk Konami was some kind of pedophile. So, if you are a die-hard fan of Puddle of Mudd and simply must have something similar before they release their next 5-star album, then get this imitation. But good luck finding it...they successfully banned this thing in the United States.
B0002DB52M|5.0|You are probably wondering how Dogville, a film that has become famous for its sparse theater-like set and supposed anti-Americanisms could ever be considered a love story or uplifting. Well, it is uplifting because it holds up a mirror. Those who don't like what they see may be seeing themselves represented on screen.  <br /> <br />Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the ideal character of the film, and yet she is persecuted and taken advantage of by good-intentioned (and emotionally-blind) citizens of Dogville. Tom is the man Grace slowly falls in love with, yet he is the same person leading the town's citizens into a moral crusade against her. The climax of the love story comes when Grace finally realizes Tom is not the good-hearted man she once loved, and acts accordingly.  With the powerful words from her father (James Caan), Grace learns that she has been arrogant by not making people accountable for their cruelty, because she has not held others to the same moral standards she holds herself. She considers others incapable of those standards (and, considering she is an ideal character, she is probably right). <br /> <br />The core of the film is the love story--the disillusionment of Grace when she realizes the true nature of Tom. When Grace finally has her revenge, it is sweet for those of us who know what it is like to be persecuted.  <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|Like (I suspect) most people reading this, I have a long history with Star Trek and all its incarnations.  But it all began with this show.  And I for one am tired of hearing about how \\"cheesy\\" it was, or \\"bad special effects.\\"  What?  Man, this was groundbreaking stuff in the late 60's, and anyone with a sense of history should realize that.<br /><br />I've pretty much enjoyed all the spinoffs, movies, etc.  But you'll never convince me that any of them had the chemistry, the ingenuity or sheer entertainment value of the classic series.  Kirk was the all-time thinking man's action hero, an Alpha Male for the 23rd century.  And there just hasn't been a more interesting alien character than Mr. Spock, played with intelligence and dignity by Leonard Nimoy.  And...well, you know about the cast already.<br /><br />As with the other Trek series DVD collections, there are several well-made featurettes.  It's a nice treat (and a bit surprising) to hear a few stories you may not have heard before.  I especially enjoyed Leonard Nimoy's comments on his widely misinterpreted autobiography \\"I Am Not Spock.\\"<br /><br />Maybe it's been awhile since you really sat down and watched Star Trek.  Maybe you marvel at how the technology on the show  Enterprise seems far in advance of that on Kirk's ship, even though Enterprise is set BEFORE the orginal Trek.  Maybe every time you see one of those Priceline commercials you wince at what the Mighty Shatner has been reduced to.  In any event, this excellent DVD set comes at a time when I think maybe we all need to be reminded of why Star Trek has endured for nearly 40 years.<br /><br />Casual fan or hardcore \\"Trekkie\\" (or \\"Trekker\\"), I really think you should get this one.
0679879269|5.0|Throghout this whole book the Church is trying to get rid Lyra because she is Eve. But Phillip Pulman's writing leaves some gaping holes in it, such as  <br />1. Why is Lyra Eve <br />2.Who is she tempted by <br />In the end, I was utterly confused. How is Lyra Eve when she is not tempted, and how is Dr. Malone \\"the snake\\" that will tempt Lyra when she urges her to go back to her own world. And if Lyra is Eve, is Will Adam? I was also dissapointed in the fact that Lyra loses the skill to read the alatheiometer because she grows up. In the first book, the Golden Compass, Iorek Byrnision says \\" When you grow up you might lose the skill to read the alatheiometer, but I'm not sure, maybe you are different.\\" I think that she should have kept that skill. Indeed, it was one of the most interesting aspects of the series, that she could read it without books, whereas others cannot.  <br /> <br />Alas, though the writing had holes in it, I still have to give it five stars. When Lyra journey's to the underworld she must leave her daemon behind, and it is heartwrenching. I cried so much and I too felt the loss of Lyra's daemon. This turned out to be a blessing in diguise, though, and after Lyra and will are able to seperate from their daemon's like witches daemons can.Speaking of witches Serifina Pekkela does not have much part in this story except for the very beginning, and the very end.  The reader wil;l also discover that Mrs.Coulter has softened and sacrifices herself to save Lyra. In the end of the book Mrss. Coulter and Lord Asriel work together to overcome the Authority. <br /> <br />I also loved the fact that Dr. Malone journeys to another world and lives with the animals there, and discovers a way to see dust. She also learns that Dust is running out of the worl, and unless it is stopped humans and animals alike will have no idea that they exist. Meanwhile the Church sends out an assasin to kill Dr. Malone and Lyra. Without knowing it the Church is helping the Authority in many ways. <br /> <br />The ending was the most moving writing I have evr seen or felt in a book. Again, I cried my little eyes out. This is a great story, though in need of a better ending, and I recommend it to every one and any one.
0226264017|5.0|Five decades on, Friedmans thoughts of the functioning of the economic and political life, are still mind-blowing. Written in a clear and powerful language, the points are well made after logical discussions of some important issues facing all societies.<br /><br />The main theme in the book is the close link between democracy and capitalism, or political freedom and economic freedom. Without the latter the former is very difficult. The Hollywood blacklist threatened the freedom of many film workers. However, the movie companies desires to make money gave them incentives to hire the blacklisted writers, producers and actors, and the workers got to work because of capitalism. Conversely, Winston Churchill never got to speak against Hitler on the government owned BBC between 1933 and the outbreak of WWII.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Friedmans belief in the individual and his abilities to take care of himself stands as a lighthouse. However, because man is imperfect, and cares mostly of himself and the closest ones, often disregarding others, power should be dispersed as much as possible. Those two propositions are the bedrock of the conservative ideology (Friedman calls it liberal, furious that the left has stolen the term), and of this book and its attacks on ICC (a regulating body turning into a lobby organization), Social Security (why is the government monopolizing saving), counter-cyclical economic policy (impossible), corporate social responsibility (not a corporate issue), the Medical Association (modern guild restricting the education of doctors) and a range of other organizations and institutions.<br /><br />In general, I think Friedman is giving to little weight on neighborhood effects, or public goods as it is called now. Nor is the fact that most human beings are irrational shortsighted, and therefore better off forced to save for later, touched upon. At last, information problems make several markets, among them education, far from perfect. Still, its one of my best reads of the year.till, its one of my best reads of the year.
B000069AUI|5.0|If you bought this album before Coldplay's debut album \\"Parachutes\\", you will see a graind improvment in their music. \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" is a grand improvement over the original. Coldplay are musical geniuses. They are the best!
B000002B2T|5.0|mad season isn't just some other side project, they were an amazing glimmer of light. only 1 cd, and that was all, but i think it should stay like this. side bands like mad season who only produce one album, produce one album for probably the purpose of making it an amazing stand out, so you could look back and say \\"man, that band was truly amazing\\"    \\"wake up\\" in my opinion is the best track here, even if it is an opener. it introduces you to the soft and hard side of \\"above\\" and the lyrics are emotionally grabbing, you understand staley. and \\"all alone\\" is a great closer, few lyrics, and just a slow goodbye after the storm. sort of like a door closing on grunge.     layne staley was truly an amazing artist, r.i.p layne.
B0000508U6|5.0|Two years before they recorded this album, \\"Coldplay\\" formed. \\"Parachutes\\", the best debut album I've heard, becomes the biggest album, becoming in the end a 4x platinum CD.  <br /> <br />This is a great set of songs from the Best Band I've heard since \\"The Beatles\\" Also, if you want to hear better music from Coldplay, buy \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\".  <br /> <br />The Real Classics on this CD (I think) are \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Everything's Not Lost\\". I love \\"Spies\\".  <br /> <br />Overall I give it  5. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY, PERIOD.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is easily the best documentary DVD I've ever seen.  I stumbled onto the program a few years ago and didn't know what it was.  I had turned the channel without knowing what was there and was hooked.  I couldn't stop watching it and had to find out what this beautiful show with no words was.  The images are breathtaking and the fact there is no dialogue helps the viewer to add their own thoughts.  This should be shown in all classes on world religion and culture because it is unbiased, honest, and respectful of all traditions in the world emphasizing unity rather than difference.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a sociopathic hit man, in \\"Collateral,\\" Michael Mann's new thriller.  Vincent offers a cabbie named Max six hundred dollars to drive him around Los Angeles for the night.  Max soon regrets allowing this wacko into his taxi.<br /><br />The best part of \\"Collateral\\" is the chemistry between Vincent, played chillingly by a gray-haired, steely-eyed Cruise, and Max, winningly portrayed as a likeable everyman by Jamie Foxx.  Cruise has flown into Los Angeles to wipe out five individuals who play key roles in a drug case, and he plans to fly out the next morning.  Whether he likes it or not, Max becomes Cruise's wheelman.  In between hits, the two men get into philosophical discussions about such topics as man's place in the universe, the challenges of making a living, and their relationship with their parents.  These sidebars are terrific and for a few fleeting moments, Cruise emerges as a human being instead of just a robotic killing machine.<br /><br />The other reason to see \\"Collateral\\" is the magnificent cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron.  Los Angeles is photographed as a glittering beauty with a cold and forbidding personality.  Vincent's and Max's isolation from the rest of humanity is symbolized by this city where, as Vincent points out, a dead man can ride on the subway for hours without anyone noticing.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, put your brain on hold.  The plot is filled with enormous holes that demand a huge suspension of disbelief, and there is a hectic chase scene that is simply absurd.  However, in spite of its obvious flaws, \\"Collateral\\" is worth seeing.  It is a funny, quirky, and off-the-wall buddy movie with a twist.
B00005ATZT|5.0|<br />The Fugitive is one of the best action/crime movies out there.  The story itself is gripping - a man wrongly accused, breaking loose and trying to prove his innocence while being doggedly pursued by ruthless law enforcement officers.  The movie doesn't waste a single moment; you're constantly propelled from one scene to the next, each scene linked tautly to the others, and you really feel that you're in the middle of the chase.  You become deeply involved in the fugitive's desperate actions. <br /> <br />He's Dr. Richard Kimble, a prominent doctor convicted of murdering his wife.  He is played by Harrison Ford in what is one of Ford's most memorable screen roles.  The performance is wonderfully understated, and that's why it's so powerful; we sense Kimble's quiet despair, quiet determination, his single-minded, all-consuming mission to clear his name and bring the real killers to light.  Tommy Lee Jones plays his pursuer, U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, and he is chilling - a cool, calculating, ruthless machine.  Even after it seems to dawn on him that Kimble is innocent, you're not sure what he'll do, or whether he'll refrain from shooting the fugitive doctor.  What's also so amazing about this film is how the relationship between Ford and Jones subtly changes over the course of the movie.  At first they're pure opponents, with no room for dialogue between them (\\"I don't care,\\" Gerard says at one point, when Kimble protests his innocence).  Then, as Kimble starts leaving clues that point to the real murderers, the two are not merely opponents, but are also partners; Kimble must trust that Gerard's agile mind will pick up on the clues and form doubts about the doctor's guilt.  And at the end, Gerard reveals a new side of himself in one simple act of courtesy that moves you unexpectedly and makes you let out a sigh of relief. <br /> <br />The Fugitive is definitely worth owning.  It doesn't matter how many times you watch it - you will always be gripped, you willalways be caught up regardless of whether you know what happens or not.
B000063CMK|5.0|I must apologize for previously giving this 2 stars. For the longest time, I was convinced this album would never grow on me, but finally it did. There is so much cool stuff here, and I really don't know why it took me so long to get into it. But I sure am glad it did. Pain of Salvation is such a great band, and they bring together such a myriad of textures and styles here. Actually, I'm still not crazy about \\"This Heart of Mine\\", but I find that it works really well within the flow of the album, to give it that diverse flavor. If you go from \\"A Trace of Blood\\" to \\"Undertow\\", it's really not the same.<br /><br />Anyway, this is great stuff. Probably still my least favorite PoS album, but definitely worth buying. The lesson to be learned is that even if you think you'll never like this band, you probably will sooner or later. Just be patient, and it'll hit you when you least expect it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Spielberg is at the top of his game with Minority Report.  He doesn't just settle for the masterful special effects; he takes care to develop the human drama as well.  Combined, the stunning visuals and the moving story line make for a great film. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise gives an intense performance and gets our sympathy as an officer in the pre-crime division, a law enforcement unit that prevents murders before they happen.  They are able to do this by using the mental powers of three pre-cogs, three human beings with strange powers and strange minds who can see the future.  The Cruise character does not have a happy past.  After the disappearance of his young son, who was kidnapped at a public pool, his marriage has fallen apart; he now lives for his job.  Then the unthinkable happens - the precogs project an image of Cruise murdering someone, and he becomes a suspect on the run, trying to evade capture while figuring out why he is set to kill a man he doesn't recognize. <br /> <br />The movie is an engrossing futuristic thriller with unexpected twists.  The supporting cast is also strong.  Colin Farrell plays an investigator looking into the pre-crime unit for glitches; his performance is suitably cool and smarmy, though he is not necessarily the bad guy.  And Samantha Morton plays Agatha, the pre-cog who holds an integral clue to the mystery of the false accusation against Cruise; Morton's presence gives depth and an ethereal power to Agatha, in what might have been a shallow performance in the hands of another actress. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|In a sea of Justin Timberlakes, generic punk rock, Britney Spears and boy bands, real talented song writing/composing is becoming a rare commodity. If you have lost faith in the music scene today, do yourself a favour and listen to this CD. This is REAL music. Stop listening to Eminem, Blink 182, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit - that's not music, it's recycled garbage. 'OK Computer' pushes the boundries of modern music, it doesn't conform to one style or ride on image. <br /> <br />'OK Computer' changed my outlook on music, it made me appreciate music as an art form. I now have an expansive music collection ranging from Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin to Sigur Ros, Massive Attack and Godspeed You Black Emperor! The only problem is there isn't enough of music like this being created, for more Radioheadish goodness listen to Kid A, Amnesiac, Hail To The Theif and The Bends. Other bands you may like if you like this would be Coldplay, Sigur Ros, Muse, Pink Floyd ('Wish You Were Here') and you like electronica/instrumental check out Mike Oldfield (Tubular Bells), Jean Michel Jarre ('Oxygene 1-6') and Godspeed You Black Emperor! <br /> <br />I really cannot say much more of what hasn't already been said so i'll just say this: Let's hope to god that pop music today is just a fad that will pass and music like this will survive.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Lost in Translation was a film that left me with mixed feelings.  Urged on by the hype surrounding the movie, the awards it won, and the breathless recommendations I received from several friends, I decided to watch it; the experience had some heartening moments, but otherwise left me unsatisfied. <br /> <br />Bill Murray is the best thing about the movie.  A middle-aged actor, reduced to doing alcohol advertisements in Japan, carrying on a strained relationship with his wife over the telephone.  He brings to the part some wonderfully wry humor and a true tiredness of heart.  He really engages the viewer.  What I also liked about the movie is that it doesn't fall into the cliche of having the older man embark on a torrid love affair with the much-younger woman; their relationship is of a kind not seen often in movies, an unexpected friendship that has sexual tension in it but goes beyond the physical.  One of the best moments in the movie is at the end, with something whispered from one character to the other that we can only guess at... <br /> <br />I was disappointed with the Scarlett Johansson character.  She hits the same note over and over again - she is sort of blank and listless and lifeless.  To her credit, she does the most with what the screenplay gives her, but you're always wanting something more from her character.  Just as you want something more from the movie.  It's interesting to watch the relationship develop, but you always sense that the movie could have done a little more with the characters or given us something more to think about and feel for.  There are some sequences I found utterly shallow (the karaoke sequence, Murray and Johansson's night out running from place to place).  It really feels like the film is treading water.  I know the film is supposed to be more \\"atmospheric\\", but unlike truly wonderful atmospheric films, there's something about this one that keeps us at a distance, that makes us wonder why we are where we are, and why itis even important for us to watch the characters do what they do. <br /> <br />As the setting, Japan is used for the comical and the strange; it's a world where two lost souls can float around and ponder the lack of meaning in their lives.  There is one scene where Johansson visits a temple - what does she think of it? What impact does it have on her? Nothing, it seems.  The country sometimes seems to be little more than a cardboard backdrop, two-dimensional.  Johansson visits a gathering of Japenese women at an ichebana (flower-arranging) lesson.  She walks through the room, brushes her fingers over some flowers, and...? And...? On to the next scene...

B000063DGC|5.0|Well you could write a sad tale about this albumn.  I won't except to say that it features possibily the best guitar player of the last 20 years or so.  In my opinion well up there with 'Live and Dangerous' by Thin Lizzy or 'Alive' by Kiss.  Frankly, if your a guitar freak you must have basically this and the UFO albumn 'Strangers in the Night' with Michael Schenker. <br />All we need now is for Ozzy to release all the video he must have on DVD, and stop fans being exploited with cheap inferior VHS or DVD of poor quality. <br /> <br />
B000286S8S|1.0|Even though there are some of the great songs from the Roth-Era, I cannot reccomend this collection. I can understand a balance between Roth and Hagar era songs, however the three new songs sound as though they were put together without regard for quality, and the real kicker is Sammy Hagar singing Roth-era songs live. Who wants that? I can see acknowledging the \\"Right Here Right Now Live\\" cd, but put Sammy singing Sammy-era songs or they could have put that cover of The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" on it. It is a blatant attempt to erase roth's connection with the music of that era. They want us to believe that Sammy is an adequate replacement for Roth, and it isn't true. No fan of Roth Era Van Halen should buy this cd. The track list is very similar to \\"Best of Vol 1\\", and it includes the great Roth songs from 1986. Accept no substitutes. Van Halen is: David Lee Roth, Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and Michael Anthony!
B00005JN2X|4.0|MOVIE: Do you know what you're doing right now? Do you know where you're gonna be in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years? Do you live in the past, present, or future? This is the focus of Michael Mann's new suspense drama. A taxi cab driver named Max tries to focus on where he's headed rather than where he is right now, which is a dead end job driving a taxi. In the blink of an eye his life becomes a toy. A contract killer chooses his cab out of the 4,000 cabs in L.A County. Now Max is involved in something he doesn't want. He immediately has gone from living in the future (thinking of how one day he's going to make it big) to living in the present (thinking of how he will survive till daylight). The film is filled with a lot of meaningful dialogue and it's meaningful because its true. Vincent (Cruise) brings up the topic of a man who died on the subway and his body was on the train all day before anybody even noticed he was dead. This brings up the point of \\"what can you do to make a difference\\". There are 6 billion people in the world, what makes you different? How can you stand out of society and not just be another cab driver, another fast food employee. Now that's that part of the movie. The other part is a well-paced intense film that will grip you and won't let go. Michael Mann knows how to make a movie but in the past his films have been rather slow-paced and even boring at times even though they have a lot of depth and meaning. Collateral is neither slow-paced nor fast-paced, it's well-paced. The last half hour will have you're heart pounding and your body snug in your seat just trying to anticipate what might happen in the next 2, 4, 6 minutes. This movie was really intense and very well made. You know that this could have been a disaster of a movie, but with so many veterans on board they turned it into something very good, very good indeed.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting here was top notch, very good. But it's really the writer you have to credit here. The dialogue is where the emotion is evoked from the audience. Every word that the characters say has meaning but the actors deliver it the way it's supposed to be. Tom Cruise was excellent, a very haunting role for the audience to watch. He's not just a killer, he's a thinker. He knows what he's doing and even though he's the bad guy, he is a smart one. I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx's work but if he does more films like this then my opinion on him will surely change. A great cast that delivered a superbly written movie.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There are times in the movie where Jamie Foxx could have escaped and ended it all, but you can counter that by saying he became emotionally involved. The movie is a near perfect suspense drama. This is not some stupid hijacking movie with stupid dialogue and fast car chases. If you know Michael Mann's work then you know you can expect something good, and even if this is your first Michael Mann movie you will enjoy this dark themed drama.

B0001UL7RY|2.0|It is abundantly clear that were Avril Lavigne not as cute as a little button, we'd never have heard of her, at least on the basis of \\"Under My Skin.\\" I had been under the impression that Avril was the Toronto wunderkind, expressing poetic concepts far more mature than her tender years. What I found was a tragic lack of attention to meter, poetic form, or even coherent structure. To be certain, there are some interesting concepts, mostly surrounding the \\"wrong boy\\" theme which pervades the disk. However, the execution evidences not only a lack of skill with the English language, but an approach I would expect from poets five or ten years her junior. The review by the supposed Canadian teacher, willow44, who thinks teaching with Avril's lyrics is \\"kinda\\" cool, proves my point. And my Canadian girlfriend has spent the past seven years touting the superiority of the Canadian educational system. If the teachers don't speak the language, we can hardly expect the students to.<br /><br /> I note that of the twelve tracks on \\"Under My Skin,\\" none represents the solo effort of Avril, another huge surprise. I had been led to believe that a huge amount of the attraction was her composition. Of the three tracks for which she evidently composed the lyrics alone, only \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is noteworthy, and even that contains the trademark awkwardness which pervades the lyrics throughout the compilation. Some have mocked Burton Cummings (good-naturedly) for cramming excess syllables into every line, but big Burt has nothing on little Avril, who just can't resist shattering the meter by either cramming eight syllables into a four syllable line, or by racking a two syllable word into five. And I thought that was an American deep south trait.<br /><br /> As for the musical arrangements, \\"Under My Skin\\" is pure bubblegum formula. Nearly every track features the instrumental rest for the first two lines of the chorus right after the bridge. As with any gimmick, once or twice can be effective, but predictable overuse is just annoying. Likewise the echo overdubbing of Avril's voice as her own backup singer (particularly annoying in the \\"all the s**t that you do\\" line in \\"My Happy Ending\\"). A novelist can be like Hemingway, taking risks and occasionally failing miserably, or like Steven King, cranking out popular drek by a strict formula, pleasing empty headed consumers in the same way McDonald's hamburgers do, but never producing anything really worthy of esteem. Avril's musical arrangements belong in the latter category.<br /><br /> \\"Take Me Away\\" is musically entertaining. As for the lyrics, to quote Heinlein, \\"semantic content is low to negative.\\" Listen and enjoy, but don't pay too close attention.<br /><br /> \\"Don't Tell Me\\" has a refreshing message for adolescent girls of all ages: refusing sexual advances by wrong boys is a sign of strength, not weakness. The music is entertaining, if predictable. Again, the lyrics exhibit metrical speed bumps which a little education (or a little more help from the professional songwriters collaberating on the disk) could and should have removed.<br /><br /> \\"My Happy Ending,\\" the obvious anchor track of the disk, is great fun to listen to, if formulaic and predictable. The overall theme is appropriately mature for a 19-year-old, but the execution is crude for a high school freshman. The awkward lyrics, broken meter, and curious phrasing detract from what would otherwise be a solid track. Crank up the volume, but don't listen too closely.<br /><br /> The other tracks are too trivial to consider, let alone mention.<br /><br /> I once attended an exhibition of Monet paintings featuring one landscape in particular with a curious smooth patch right in the center. From the two or three smaller studies of the same scene, it was evident Monet tried to put human figures there, but couldn't get them right, and scraped off and painted over repeatedly before just giving up on the idea and just slashing in a road instead.By the strength of his other work, Monet can be forgiven for the occasional goof. Avril's work exhibits comparable lack of skill in every track on this disk, with no evident attempt to rewrite and improve. And all this is with the assistance of a host of professional songwriters, who really ought to know better.<br /><br /> Overall, I enjoyed the disk. Once. Replaying only led to irritation and boredom. It's coming out of the changer, and going next to Bryan Adams, for well-deserved Canadian obscurity.<br /><br /> Oh, and Avril, honey, lose the eye makeup. You look like a raccoon.g in a road instead. By the strength of his other work, Monet can be forgiven for the occasional goof.

B000002U9L|5.0|This has got to be one of the best soundtracks available.  One of the greatest ones of all time because it's so fun & magical.  Its music takes the human mind into a fantasy world!  Beautiful, classy, exciting...very dreamy!  Nearly every track on here is wonderful.  The movie, \\"The Labyrinth\\", is really incredible & memorable & this music has been clearly defined to be its soul. <br /> <br />I've had this CD for several years & I still highly enjoy it!  Great for little children with big imaginations.
0671027573|5.0|Linda Howard has quickly become one of my favorite romance authors, though for a long time I was reluctant to read this particular book of hers.  Now that I have read it I could kick myself for wasting time.  Read this book now!  It is funny, serious, sexual and I love Janie as the lead.  She is smart, sassy and doesn't fade into the long list of romance novel women.  She is an individual with more to talk about than what she wants in a guy. . . which brings us to the plot. <br />Four friends make up a list of a Mr. Perfect, the list gets out and people start dying. . . Creepy, especially with the beginning prologue.  But that is not the whole of the story, there are four friends, all different but fun, there's an annoying neighbor, A ford Shelby mustang, lots of humor and . . . the hero is great.  He is not intimidated by this list of what a perfect man should be.  That in itself is sexy, not to mention he has a really great. . . shoe size.  All in all, this is a great read at any time.  Perhaps not in public though unless you want to embarrass yourself by bursting out in laughter.
B000089RVX|1.0|Listen to this CD before jumping out of a tenth story window. It will give you the courage.
078322933X|5.0|Although many have claimed how badly acted and utterly cheesy they think this movie is, it's pure escapist entertainment. If you're going to have an obsessive boyfriend, wouldn't you want it to be someone as hot and magnetic as Mark Wahlberg? Engaging and often suspensful, it will keep you wondering what's going to happen next to a young Reese Witherspoon and a typically trampy Alyssa Milano. After watching this, the Rolling Stone song Wild Horses (performed by the Sundays) will definitely take on new meaning for you.
B00006879E|2.0|This group dissappointed me. They were ALMOST good, you can just feel it, but they fall short of the mark. Whenever I hear this mediocre group's lead singer pandering on and on over the radio airwaves, I am reminded of the J. Geils Band, except less clever.
B00005BL2A|5.0|This album is a little different than their other cds, and more mellow, but that is not neccesarily a bad thing.  My favorite DM cd's are Black Celebration and Violator, but Exciter is also a beautiful album.  It was nice because it was positive, relaxing, and gorgeous.  It has uplifting messages, and Martin Gore is quite a poet.  Dave sounds great as usual, and the music is good too.  Since DM are geniuses, anything they put out is gonna be good.  Cheers to the best band in the history of music. (past, present, future).
B00000DG1R|4.0|Duran Duran were not a good a band as, say, Depeche Mode, but DD did have quirks that DM missed out on. For one thing, their music is a lot more fun. When \\"Planet Earth\\" plays in a club you had better believe everyone is out on the dancefloor. The greatest has it all: camp, cheese, sex, emotion and dance hit one right after the other. I only gave this album four out of five because the later tracks are weaker than the earlier ones. Give this album a shot, you might like it in spite of yourself.
B00008EYA5|1.0|This movie is a nightmare from start to finish.  The plot is completely unbelievable, the dialoge is absolutely atrocious, and the characters are anything but memorable.  The first half of the movie is dedicated to telling the \\"story\\" of a SWAT team and how it is put together.  This is intercut with some convoluted plot about an international drug dealer and his bad guy sentiments.  Also, you get the oh-so-tired captain as bastard plot.  It is trite to say the least.  Then after the druglord is captured you, as the viewer, are expected to believe that an international terrorist can hap hazardly make the proclimation that he will pay someone 100 million dollars to free him from prison and that the majority of Los Angeles will jump on board and do it.  Are you kidding me?  I mean I'm not looking for hyper realism in my action movies, but that is completely absurd.  Then you are expected to believe that these small time thugs could conjure up a death defying search and sieze mission in less than an hour.  It is completely ludicrous.  This movie treats you as nothing more that an empty head.  It gives you nothing to believe in.  There is no redeeming quality to it at all.  Again, not that I want my action films to be intellectually challenging or anything, but please treat me as if I have a little bit going on in my brain!   <br />Finally: avoid this movie at all costs!
B000002L75|4.0|Ah, the \\"Wedding Album\\" (see the cover). I wasn't around to appreciate Depeche Mode at the time this album came out, but I can tell you that this group is just as relevent now as they were then. I'd even say they are even more relevant because music seems to be headed in this direction. If you are just getting into Depeche Mode, start here and work forward. Back in the eightees Depeche Mode were one of the pioneers of electronic music along with Kraftwerk, David Bowie, Gary Numan and Duran Duran. The latter group, Duran Duran, went ultrapop while Depeche hung on to its darker roots even when they went mainstream. They weren't really mainstream, at least in the US, until \\"Music for the Masses\\" came out but if you want to be a true Depeche Mode fan, you should buy \\"Some Great Reward\\" for the history as well as the KICK ASS music on this album. This is just a great record for anybody who wears black clothing a lot and is a fan of eightees music. But in all seriousness I recommend this album for anybody who is serious about pop music. Of all the albums in the Depeche Mode catalog, this is one that you'll be listening to over and over again.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Ah, Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon was BOURNE to have such a great role.  His character was BOURNE amnesiac, but BOURNE to be a hardcore fighting machine.  He's BOURNE to provide good mix of espionage and action.  And he's BOURNE to bring the best of what this movie has to offer.<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is the second chapter of an already-popular spy-thriller series based on the best-selling books by Robert Ludlum.  Jason Bourne is back once again, beating up bad guys that get in his way with such swift charisma and a stealth ability of Sam Fisher, all in a grave search to find his unknown identity.  Whether or not he does find his true credentials., what I find in this a much deeply-plotted movie that brought my attention to its qualities that, in its rarest form, make it much better than the original.  It's a BOURNE fact, moviegoers.<br /><br />It's been a while since the original took place, and an espionage objective has occurred in Berlin thanks to the people of the CIA.  Their objective backfired, though, cause someone killed the people involve in the spy mission.  Meanwhile in India, Jason and his girlfriend, Marie, were taking it easy on the simple Hindu land after their previous adventure, or are they, `cause Jason's keep having terrible dreams about his blurry past.  Sadly, the past comes back at him, as he and his girl are on the road to get away from a Russian hitman that's following them, and the hitman killed Marie and their jeep landed on a river from the bridge, presumably dead.  What the hitman didn't know is that Bourne is still alive and he's furious enough for revenge.  Too bad one objective leads to another, because Bourne's also on the run from the CIA, who thinks the one that killed the operatives in the spy mission is him.  So now he must find the enemies that tried to assassinate him while clearing his name for murder.<br /><br />A fan's way of speaking: Bourne can kick Bond's sleazy *ouch*.  This sequel really brought out more character to the main guy.  On \\"Identity\\", I see him as a kung-fu amnesiac with plenty of arsenal and essentials; I didn't see him any different that any other movie spy out there.  But in \\"Supremacy\\", he was BOURNE to be a distinct person.  Even when he lost his loved one, he didn't go off and get another one during the whole movie; he isn't a womanizer like that certain popular British agent.  Plus, he's doesn't always keep his cool.  He's remorse about the things that happen, and confused about things he doesn't understand.  With such character development,  I started to appreciate him more, and find him much favorable.<br /><br />This movie is BOURNE to be much more story-driven than it's predecessor (although I still think it's essential to watch the first movie before this).  As the plotlines builds up, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" will take Matt Damon in exotic continental lo-cals such as Germany, India, and Moscow.  During his busy time running away from the CIA and finding clues that would lead to the assassins` whereabouts, he treats himself with a little bit of flashback scenarios.  These scenarios play a key role in the movie, since they fill in a few gaps for Bourne's elusive past.  The story wouldn't be as engaging if people like me are expecting some action to coincide it, and there is.  I got to find out who is the fight choreographer in this movie, because I want to applaud him (or her) for having such unusual ideas to make these fighting scenes look so awesome and swift.  There's also a few B-rated car chases to add into its adrenaline mix (as if I care about those).  Okay, the action scenes aren't as well-balanced as the story, but they're still cool to watch.<br /><br />The actors here are pretty well-rounded, not to my surprise from the cold and serious Matt Damon.  Joan Allen does just as well as the CIA agent Pamela Landy who's looking for Bourne.  Julia Stiles makes her fine second appearance in the Bourne saga as Nicky, once again; toobad she doesn't have much of a role here.  If there's anything to say about the musical score, it's Moby's \\"Extreme Ways\\" during the ending credits.  The song just fits right for the intensity of the spy-thriller.  Other than that, the score's good but it sounded similar to the original.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Substantial.  Simply put, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" brings the cake and adds some icing in it as well.  It proves so much substance, while still having the crazy style at the same time. Yep, this movie is BOURNE to attract people looking for a good spy-action movie for the summer; it has for me.  I'm starting to look forward to \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" in 2006!<br /><br />Note:  I don't count \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" as part of the saga, since that story was not authorized by the same guy.ce again; too bad she doesn't have much of a role here.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|With so many bad reviews of this movie, I felt the need to set some of the record straight and give this movie the five stars that it deserves. <br /> <br />The Butterfly Effect is different, and some people just can't handle a movie that doesn't have a typical Hollywood plot with a typical Hollywood ending. <br /> <br />This is a thinking man's movie. The idea that if you can travel back in time you can change the future is by no means a novel idea. What's unique here is the movie's overall darkness. There are several different alternate realities each one done with incredible detail. <br /> <br />This movie has the best inside prison scenes I've ever seen ina movie. I learned from watching the movie with the directors' commentary that it was filmed in in a real prison, and the extras were real prisoners.  Incredible. <br /> <br />I've noticed a lot of subtle things in the movie that the directors didn't even mention in their commentary (which is well worth listening to). <br /> <br />The DVD is doublsided and contains two versions of the movie. The Theatrical release version and the Director's Cut which is the movie the way the directors original wanted it to be seen. Luckily I watched the Director's cut, not realizing how signficant the differences are. It turns out to be a good thing that I never watched this movie in the theater, because the Director's Cut on the DVD is by far superior to what was shown in the theater. <br /> <br />The movie was filmed with a relatively low budget, only $13 million, which explains some of the negatives people may have. A $26 million movie has a little more in the way of slickness, a little more leeway to take more time in filming and get better performances from the actors by having more takes to choose from. Nevertheless, I had no idea that I was watching a \\"bad performance\\" until I read reviews after watching the movie. <br /> <br />This is the best movie I've watched in many months. If you don't like movies that are different, then skip it, but if you like a unique, dark, and atypical movie, watch the Director's Cut and enjoy.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Adapted from Dennis Lehane's critically acclaimed novel, Clint Eastwood's \\"Mystic River\\" is a masterful achievement. It does nothing less than elevate contemporary working-class Boston into the realm of Shakespearean tragedy. The film is superbly crafted by screenwriter Brian Helgeland and may turn out to be Clint Eastwood's crowning masterpiece as a director. It also helps that Eastwood has assembled one of the finest ensemble casts in years to act out this deep, gripping story. When you have Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney in the same movie, there isn't a lot that can go wrong. And very little does.<br /><br />\\"Mystic River\\" is the story of three men and the past events that haunt them in adulthood. Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon), and Dave (Robbins) were friends when they were children, until one day Dave is abducted by two men pretending to be police officers. They sexually abuse him and he manages to escape four days later. The story then shifts to the present day, where the three have grown apart from one another. Then the murder of Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter brings them back together.<br /><br />Sean Penn gives a furious, impressive performance here, for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor. His Jimmy Markham is toughened by the prison time he has done, but will do anything to protect his wife and children. Although there are moments when Penn seems to be showing off how good of an actor he is and going slightly overboard, there is an intensity in his characterization that is mesmerizing. The scenes where Jimmy mourns his murdered daughter are some of the most moving depictions of grief I have ever seen on film.<br /><br />As the severely disturbed Dave Boyle, Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career. Dave is haunted by what happened to him as a child, and he can do nothing to escape his memories of it. Robbins is astounding to watch, his body sagging with the weight of a lifetime, his eyes filled with fear and shame. It's no wonder that Robbins won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Marcia Gay Harden also turns in solid work as Dave's troubled wife Celeste, who thinks her husband might be a killer. Harden spends much of the film on the edge of hysteria, wracked with guilt. It could have been a thankless role, but Harden makes it count.<br /><br />With all of the emoting from Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, it would be easy to dismiss Kevin Bacon's work here. As Sean, a homicide detective who has recently been deserted by his wife, Bacon has the least flashy of the three main roles. But with admirable subtlety, Bacon skillfully etches a portrait of a man whose non-nonsense exterior conceals a deep well of pain. As his partner, Laurence Fishburne provides the solid support needed to make the murder investigation plot work.<br /><br />Mention must also be made of Laura Linney's superb performance. As Jimmy's wife Annabeth, Linney seems to be always in the background, observing. In fact, she barely seems to be in the movie at all. Then she has an astonishing scene at the end of the film, a simple dialogue with her husband where she reveals the Lady Macbeth-like depths of her character. It makes your jaw drop. It is a compliment to Laura Linney's extreme talent as an actress that she almost steals the movie with about ten minutes of screen time.<br /><br />\\"Mystic River\\" is a dark, brooding, masterpiece of a film.

B0001FR3IQ|5.0|I have to say that I had pretty low expectations for this film, having read a lot of negative critical reviews, and I have to say, having seen this film, I am really at a loss to words as to what they thought was so bad about it.... I really, really enjoyed it.It is brillianly acted and directed. Halle gives a flawless performance, her second best to that in Monster's Ball. She is absolutely superb in this movie. It is an unbelievably stylish, clever and satisfying horror flic, and undoubtedly the best I've seen in a long, long time, possibly since The Others, which I adored. Miss it at your peril. There are some fantastic special effects, great twists, and gorgeous cinematography. The atmosphere throughout the whole film is beautifully gothic. The supporting cast are very competent, particularly. Penelope Cruz whom I never really warmed to before,but was excellent here. At times the dialogue is dissappointing but otherwise, a brilliant film... I recommend it to any lover of good, fun horror, that is still intelligent.

John Cippolina is in full force. Check him out too on the recently released Grateful Dead. Closing of Winterland, where he leads a 20 min \\"Not Fade Away\\".
0808514121|5.0|Like everyone who went to highschool and college I read Steinbeck.  Somewhere in my literary past I read EAST OF EDEN and my memory of the book is positive.<br /><br />However, over the last week or so of driving and doing mindless tasks around my house, I listened to Richard Poe's reading of EAST OF EDEN.  The resonant tones of Poe's voice mixed with the masterful story telling of John Steinbeck make for a magical experience.<br /><br />For those who do not appreciate the classics and do not understand the power of Steinbeck, I urge you to listen to Poe's version. He makes the characters come alife. You can feel the evil of Kate and the wisdom of Lee. You can feel the pain of Cal and Aron and struggle that they lived.<br /><br />EAST OF EDEN is a wonderful and power story that recreates the story of Cain and Abel.  There are a thousand term papers and phd dissertation in this work.  Classes and discussion groups could go on forever.<br /><br />The version I had was 22 CD's and it seemed like a lot when I got started. By the time I got to the end, I was sorry it was over.

And then she jumped on this trendy Kabbalah fad and changed her name to Miss Esther.  As in Aunt Esther from \\"Sanford and Son?\\"  Madonna DOES NOT know what she's doing.  She's just too old and needs to retire.  And when I heard RAPPING on this CD I just wanted to fall on the floor and laugh.  Miss Thing ain't no Lil' Kim and never will be.  Next!
B00006LLNU|5.0|This may possibly be the most wonderful album I own. I bought it on a whim one day earlier this summer and have listened to it at least every night since.  <br /> <br />Sigur Ros  doesn't give off an artificial mood (like many other bands). It eminates feelings. Emotion. It conjures up everything important you've ever felt and summarizes it with music. This is the kind of record that makes someone want to keep on going.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I'm not sure I need to add to some of the very thorough reviews here.  I think the movie is excellent-I thought the characters were three dimensional, the dialogue was crisp (as was the lack of conversation). <br /> <br />I will, however, attempt to return this movie.  I refuse to pay for a movie and be force-fed previews.  It is a pity that Universal decided to spoil a great film with five minutes of garbage. <br /> <br />If I were to make one recommendation, it would be this: if you want to watch this, go rent it.  Don't give Hollywood any (more) incentive to sell you ads.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is definitely one of Disney's great feature films.  You all know the story, I'm sure, so I won't bore you with the details.  It's amazing how human the characters really seemed.  They were all wonderfully drawn by the animators and voiced by the actors; I think my favorite scene has to be during the song \\"There's Something There,\\" when Belle and the Beast begin to realize they have feelings for each other.  Just watch the body language and looks on their faces; you really feel what they're feeling -- and these are cartoons!!!   <br /> <br />Right from the opening scene we know we're in for something special, when the camera pans down from a crowded street scene onto Belle.  Things only get better from there, as there's nary a dull spot to be found in the story.  The musical numbers are some of the best from a Disney feature, especially \\"Belle,\\" \\"Gaston,\\" \\"Be Our Guest,\\" \\"There's Something There,\\" -- oh, who am I kidding?  They're all fantastic. <br /> <br />As for the special features, brace yourself, there's a ton of them.  The main disc houses not one, not two, but three different versions of the film!  We have the theatrical version, a special edition version which adds a new song from the Broadway show, \\"Human Again,\\" and finally a work-in-progress version, which was shown at the New York Film Festival in September 1991, three months before its final release.  There's an audio commentary by the directors, a sing-along track, and part one of a two-part game (the second part is on disc two). <br /> <br />Disc two is divided into four areas: The first area is called The Secret West Wing, and it houses the second part of said game.  The second area is called Chip's Fun And Games, and is aimed at the little kiddies in the audience.  There's a little featurette on Disney animation, a create-your-own-song game, and a video for a horrendous pop version of \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" by some group called Jump 5. <br /> <br />The third area is called Cogsworth & Lumiere'slibrary, which is basically an hour-long making of special which details the origins, development, story, music, characters, production design, animation, visual effects, marketing, and awards of the film, and finally talks about the Broadway musical.  The final area is called Mrs Potts' Engaging Treats, and is for the average film watcher.  It has a half-hour making of special which is just a truncated version of the one in C&L's library.  There's also a little feature called \\"Story Behind The Story,\\" which talks about the differences between the original stories and film versions of seven Disney films.  We end off with a cool personality profile game, in which you find out which BEAUTY AND THE BEAST character you're most like (apparently I'm most like Belle), and finally, the Celine Dion-Peabo Bryson version of the title song (which isn't nearly as good as Angela Lansbury's version in the movie).  All in all, a near perfect DVD. <br /> <br />The film:  5 stars. <br />The extras:  5 stars.
B00007FOMP|4.0|For those who already have the album and are reading my review to see what I think of it, or how smart/stupid I am music-wise: <br /> <br />I gave it 4 and a half stars for 2 reasons: 1. 'Save the Children' and 'Wholy Holy' are both good songs, but are a little redundant, if you know what I mean.  2. SOME of the lyrics on all the songs are a bit dated and repetative. I'm a 60's fanatic, but I find the same theme in almost every song. However, some of these themes are eerily current, too. I'm writing this review while listening to 'Inner City Blues, ' so I fet that it wasn't fair to give Marvin less than 4.5 stars. <br /> <br />For those who haven't purchased this priceless peice of ART: <br /> <br />YOU HAVE NOT LIVED!!!!!! I'm in a mood for typing, so I'll tell you about all of the songs from the original album: <br /> <br />1. What's Going on -- I know you all have heard this song brfore. But just in case, I'll tell you that this song is the one that makes you feel like you feel bittersweet. It makes you feel like you are brothers and sisters with everyone in the world and you've got to get a little tranquility back in the world. It is a great song, and I know you'll love it. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. What's Happening Brother -- Another favorite. If you read the first part of this review, you'll know that I found a theme that can be a little redundant. Even so, this song has a great tune and makes you feel good. Personally, I like it more than What's Going On. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Flyin High in the Friendly Sky -- This is one of the 3 songs on the album that have repetative tunes. Having said that, get a copy of the lyrics -- they are quite powerful and poetic. Again, it can get old, but it remains much better than any song that's been new to the radio in the last 20 years. 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Save the Children -- Ahh, Save the Children. I like this song, but it is another of the songs that can get boring. I even think that it can get annoying at times. Still, it'sa bit catchy and it has a great tune. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. God is Love -- YAY! We're back to the great songs again. Short and sweet, this is about as catchy as songs can get. It captures the essence of soul music, the art form that Marvin had a monopoly over. It even makes me laugh when the singers sing 'peace' at a really high note in-between the alloted time signature. I think it sounds funny. This is the kind of song that Marving Pentz Gaye, Jr. was born to sing. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Mercy, Mercy Me -- As great as the previous one, but there isn't a theme involving God in this one. It's much more realistic, and it does a better job of getting the point across that we need to fix the world. Brilliant. 10/10 [again] <br /> <br />7. Right On -- A more upbeat song that talks about how the upper class is treated better than the lower and middle classes by citizens and by the government, letting them be neglected [ahem..George Bush...ahem]. This is a very good song that adds a touch of cynicism to the album. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Wholy Holy -- This is the last of the 3 redundant songs. Again, it is still good, but after 2 minutes it just gets BORING. I'm not one of those people who has to listen to fast, hard songs, either -- I just don't particularly like this song. It beats the songs of the late Rick James, though, that's for sure. 7/10 <br /> <br />9. Inner City Blues [Make Me Wanna Holler] -- There has never been a better closing track. Others have tied it, but this is just simply one of the top 5 Marvin Gaye songs. It has fantastic lyrics that are still relevant and a tune that will blow you out of the water. I think it is my favorite song by Marvin. I can't explain it any more than that. 10/10 <br /> <br />OVERALL: 81/90 WHOO!!!!! That's a lot of typing. The bottom line is that Marvin took a risk with this album -- it was sink or swim. This one would win a gold medal at the summer olympics for swimming [sorry, I had to say that]. This album is for any taste. Bothmy friends who listen to rap and the ones who listen to classical have a place in their hearts for this album. I guaruntee you will, too. Peace, love, and good bread.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I have to admit right off the bat that this is going to be an extremely biased review.  Why?  Because I am obsessed with the Beatles, and this boxed set includes more information than I could ever dream of.  My only previous experience with the Anthology (aside from the CDs, of course) was when it was shown on ABC in late 1995, I believe.  If I'm not mistaken, it was only about half the length we have now.  We follow them from their Liverpool childhoods, to their years as the Quarrymen, onto their Hamburg days, dropping Pete Best, acquiring Ringo Starr, and finally set to take on America.  And that's just on the first disc!  There's three more where that came from, and in quick succession we hear about anything and everything related to the Fab Four, from the songs to the personalities, from John's Jesus comments to the bed-in for peace.  The only problem I have is that the final four years are sort of glossed over rather quickly on the last disc, and we get precious little information about their post-Beatle careers; after all, if we include pre-Beatle stuff, why not the aftermath? <br /> <br />But that's just an obsessive fan's complaint towards an otherwise spectacular anthology.  The special features take up the fifth and final disc, although they are not as plentiful as one might have hoped for.  We get the \\"Real Love\\" music video, a featurette on the making of the \\"Free As A Bird\\" video (which is featured at the end of the fourth disc, at the end of the whole shebang), a couple of little singalongs between Paul, George and Ringo (one in George's garden estate, one at the studio), and featurettes on how they picked which songs would go on the Anthology albums and how they recorded the two new songs.  Finally, we get a little segment where the DVD producers talk about making the Anthology TV series. <br /> <br />The film:  5 stars. <br />The extras:  4 stars.
1581804849|4.0|Dewberry offers a wide variety of one-stroke flowers to paint using clear instructions. The real beauty using her painting method is the lack of \\"must do\\" instructions. Instead, the author gives clear directions on how to make nifty decorative flowers that are easily painted without patterns. A good read for the novice decorative painter like me.
B000002UAX|5.0|When I was in highschool this was the first and only Beatles album I bought and it was on vinyl (around 1980 or 1981). And even though there's a couple of incredibly irritating songs on it (Wild Honey Pie, and Revolution 9), I still listen to this Beatles album more than any of the others and I own all of them now. I think Abbey Road and Revolver are better ablums, but I find myself wanting to listen to this one much more than all the rest.  <br /> <br />It may be true that this album was the catalyst for the Beatles ultimate break-up mainly because of so many individual efforts taking place rather than group performances, but it's still an amazing piece of work.
038551123X|5.0|Dexter Morgan isn't your typical serial killer. He only murders bad guys and in inventively gruesome (but undescribed in detail) ways. Dexter, the foster child of a homicide detective, works for the police as a blood spatter analyst. His foster sister Deborah is trying to get out of the vice unit, where she has to dress like a prostitute.<br /><br />  Life is going along nicely for Dexter until another serial killer emerges in the Miami scene. This serial killer has a different style, one Dexter longs to emulate. In fact, Dexter feels a strong and strange affinity to this new murderer in our midst.<br /><br />  Jeff Lindsay has written a marvelously dark novel of a cordial serial killer. He is charming, means no harm to decent people and utterly nuts. Well, maybe he isn't really nuts, but he's certainly a little removed from the mainstream.<br /><br />  Anyone the least bit familiar with the Miami area, even as a tourist, will laugh as Lindsay's descriptions. The plot is fresh, the characters other than Dexter fleshed out with some depth and the action flows smoothly.<br /><br />  This is a pure fun read. While the idea of a serial killer as a likeable character may sound strange, Dexter Morgan is defeinitely the exception.<br /><br />Jerry
B00005IC2H|5.0|The biggest accomplishment of this album is getting me to sit through a 10 minute song and not get bored. In fact, most songs are 6 minutes or longer.  <br /> <br />Get lost in this album...I guarantee you it won't be difficult.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I really like the sound of this band ever since I saw them perform on a late show one night.  I really do think they sound better live, since the album is a little too mellow and restrained for my taste, but good and relaxing nonetheless.  Ignore the people who are on here saying he is a no talent - since they must have no appreciation for real talent, and must be too used to all the crap they play in between commericals on American radio stations these days.  The Damien Rice band is very talented, and it seems to me it is only a matter of time before they go mainstream, and are doing international tours.
B000000W8C|4.0|This is a great, great album. Any fan of the band, or \\"Urban Hymns\\", or brit-pop, or just amazing tunes really should hear this. I admit it's not as easy to listen to as the next album, but it's just as good given the chance. Songs like \\"New Decade\\", \\"On Your Own\\", and the beautiful \\"History\\" make this disc one of the best of the genre. It's what I would call their \\"Bends\\" or \\"Unforgettable Fire\\", if you know what I mean. The classic before the classic. Anyway, be you southern or northern, every soul should give it a listen.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I plan to buy this and give it away later. The USA version is great and is released sooner which is a bonus. I prefer the real thing, the Japanese version which is a 'uncut, uncensored, no deleted scene type' due to come out Oct. 2004.<br /><br />Note that in this earlier, USA release has a deleted scene: \\"Damoe\\" and according to my research (Googling, weblogs, etc.) , here's what I found:<br /><br />The special Japanese edition boxset will include the original uncut 4 hour version, and we can hope there are many special features.<br /><br />The uncensored version they did for Japan......none of that black and white footage to mute out the blood........<br /><br />I think I'll stick around for the Japanese version. Mind you...you won't need to learn Japanese.
0743488814|5.0|I have come to love everything Jodi Picoult writes and this is no exception. As a parent this book moved me and affected me so deeply because we parents will do whatever we need to do to protect and save our children. This book brings to light those difficult decisions and asks &quot;just how far can/should we go&quot;? I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is a relatively slow-paced film, but quite interesting nonetheless.  Two seemingly-opposite Americans - Bob, a former film star reduced to shooting whiskey commercials, and Charlotte, a young wife \\"forgotten\\" by her husband - happen to meet in the same Tokyo hotel, and, despite the fact that Bob could theoretically be Charlotte's father, they find much-needed comfort in each other as together they explore Japanese society.  For those who know a bit about Japanese culture, the film takes on additional meanings, or at least the diverse elements of Japanese society are less foreign.   <br /> <br />The film takes place almost entirely in Tokyo, which is great, but there is also so much more that Japan can offer that it is a great downfall of the film that so little time is spent elsewhere - and this is seemingly just to show the conventional shot of Mount Fuji, as the core \\"action\\" of the time away from Tokyo could very easily have been done at a shrine in or near Japan's capital city.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Bill Murray (Bob) comes across as being extremely stiff throughout virtually the entire film, even in the \\"lighter\\" moments.  Yet, this also works well, a visual representation of just how \\"lost\\" Bob feels in Japan - compounded by events back home.   <br /> <br />The cinematography is beautiful, portraying Tokyo quite nicely - especially at night.  What is most surprising is the sheer pervasiveness of handheld shots throughout the film, subtly disorienting the (Western) viewer in relation to this (foreign) society.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, due to two scenes of sexual content, Lost in Translation was given an \\"R\\" rating.  While these scenes certainly are realistic in terms of Japanese culture, they are entirely unnecessary and highly atypical of the rest of the film - and of the \\"relationship\\" between Bob and Charlotte.   <br /> <br />The primary downfall of the DVD, however, is the set of previews - more than five minutes of materialwhich cannot be skipped.  The best Universal will allow is to fast-forward through these trailers.   <br /> <br />In the end, Lost in Translation is a wonderful film, and one which needs to be in the collection of everyone who has any connection with Japan - by blood, by friendship, or simply be appreciation.
B00008438V|5.0|The best of John Hughes.  I watched this at least 100 times as a kid.  It does not get any better!  The only thing that could have made this one better was a bit more skin from Kelly LeBrock, what a woman!  I recommend it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a great movie.  Finally a film about something different, unpredictable, funny and moving.  Characters, famous and not,  all have a basic loneliness and when they were out of town in a far away land they meet, relate, and form bonds.  The movie takes place in Japan so that setting is what makes the film the great film it is.  The Japanese setting and culture is fantastically imposing and crucial to the film.<br />Treat yourself to this movie.
B000003TA4|5.0|okay true, this album may be a bit overrated, but still, this remains one of my favorite albums of my collection. as for the a$$hole who called van halen, bb king, and hendrix \\"posers\\", they can kiss my butt because all of them could kick cobains a$$ when it comes to flat out guitar playing. when it comes to songwriting, cobain was one of the best. personally, i dont give a $#it abut avril because shes not a very good guitar player compared to hedrix, van halen, or even cobain. now that i got that off my chest, this album is definitely worth the money. some of the lyrics dont make much sense though. admit it you cobain-worshipers! nevertheless, this remains a classic, and it should. the trio connects with fierce telepathy on every track.

1592400876|3.0|First of all, having taught English for over 35 years in both high school and college, I would agree with Lynn Truss that people make horrible grammar and usage mistakes, apparently everywhere English is used, and it is used widely.  I also agree that this stuff IS important for clarily and as a means of showing respect for those with whom we choose to communicate.  One of my college students in his end-of-the-course review, after a nice compliment, went on to describe me as \\"comma happy,\\" so I did find the Truss book enjoyable, if not spiritual, in many places.  However, I wish that it would have been re-edited for American consumption because I fear that many Americans who are not quite astute as to the significant differences between British and American usage will, in the process of taking her to heart, observe punctuation that is just not correct in America.  That difference, by the way, does not mean that our method on our side of the Atlantic is any better that theirs; it merely shows that the language is always changing and re-adapting itself--something that I feel Truss also acknowledges and is accepting of (like sentences that end in prepositions).  It's a good book, but it could have been better.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore has said he made Fahrenheit 9/11 to force Americans to discuss the invasion of Iraq, and the greater war on terrorism, both of which which he felt had been rubber-stamped by Congress and rushed past the American people. <br /> <br />It is impossible to argue that he has not reached that goal. If nothing else, note that there are nearly 700 reviews of this DVD on Amazon two months before it is to be released. <br /> <br />Whether or not you agree with Moore's politics, you have to agree that he makes powerful films. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 in the theater about a month after it's release, when the Bush administration had had plenty of time to do all they could to discredit Moore and his film. The audience by then was small, but they CHEERED at the end of the movie. <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 may be the best finger-in-the-eye-of-the-powerful you will ever see. It's also great film making.
B0001AP12G|5.0|\\"The College Dropout\\" is one of the most anticipated albums by one of hip hop's most sought after producer, Kanye West. Surprisingly, Kanye lives up to all expectations and surpasses. every single track on this album is equipped with tight production from kanye, but his production skills were never questioned. His lyrical skills however were put to the test and he more than held his ground on tracks with hip hop's greats mos def, common, and even the great jigga man himself. The best track probably has to be \\"All Falls Down\\" with Jay-Z. This song is off the chain. Other hot tracks include \\"Through the wire\\", the controversial \\"Jesus walks\\", and one of the most underrated tracks, \\"Family Business\\". All in all, as Jay-Z slips into retirement, Rocafella records has a new king of hip hop as Kanye West delivers on both sides of making tracks, the production as well as the lyrics. People worldwide will be anticipating his next album from one of hip hop's up and coming artists.
6305971935|4.0|If you plan this movie to have sub-titles, beware, an unusual dvd:  No Sub-Titles included. <br />Otherwise, the movie is just good as it was twenty-years ago.
B0000DG00B|5.0|Opening with a thoroughly bizarre introduction, and equipped with the unwieldy handle of \\"Live At The Atlanta International Pop Festival: July 3 & 5, 1970\\", this excellently remastered double live album captures The Allman Brothers Band in July of 1970, eight months before the legendary Fillmore shows.    The sound is very, very good, crisp and realistic, and the young band plays with authority and skill (singer and organ player Gregg Allman was 22 at the time, and guitarist Duane Allman little more than a year older). Duane Allman and Dickey Betts play off the muscular organ riffs of Gregg, laying down energetic, eager and lean renditions of songs like \\"Every Hungry Woman\\", \\"Trouble No More\\", and \\"Statesboro Blues\\", versions which have a tough, rock n' roll-like immediacy sometimes lost on longer, more improvisational versions of those songs.    Disc I is the longest, although not by much. Duane Allman's slide guitar burns all the way through, and he and Dickey Betts lay down galvanizing licks behind Gregg's powerful vocals on \\"Trouble No More\\", \\"Every Hungry Woman\\" and \\"Don't Keep Me Wonderin'\\". Thom Doucette adds gritty blues harmonica to several numbers, bassist Berry Oakley sings a great, rough version of \\"(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\\", and the 11-minute \\"Elizabeth Reed\\" features more high-class guitar playing than most full-lenght CDs.  \\"Whipping Post\\" includes a l-o-n-g instrumental jam which will probably appeal mostly to diehards, and this is not the best version I've heard of that song, but almost everything else on the first disc is top-notch, including the coolest, most swinging \\"Mountain Jam\\" ever!    Disc II features the original mixes of July 7th's performances of \\"Whipping Post\\" and \\"Statesboro Blues\\", first released on \\"First Great Rock Festivals Of The Seventies\\". (\\"Every Hungry Woman\\" from disc I has seen the light of day before, too; everything else is previously unreleased.)  This version of \\"Don't Keep Me Wonderin'\\" is even more magnificent than the one on disc I, a tough-as-nails rendition, all howling slide guitars and pounding drums, courtesy of Butch Trucks and Jaimoe Johnson. And this very tight, four-minute \\"Statesboro Blues\\" features, among its many other virtues, three magnificent, fiery guitar solos, including the opening one which threatens to ignite the CD player.    The 28-minute (!) \\"Mountain Jam\\" features a guest appearance by Johnny Winter, who plays third guitar, and if you like 28-minute Allman Brothers jams (not everybody does), this version will thrill you.   Disc II's 13-minute take on \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed\\" is unusually beautiful, filled with urgency and power, and while the 9-minute \\"They Call It Stormy Monday\\" is somewhat more subdued than the Fillmore version, it has lots of soul and some fine guitar playing as well.    Lots of listeners have already made up their mind and decided that the Allmans' \\"At Fillmore East\\" album is the greatest thing ever as far as early live Allman Brothers is concerned, and this album probably won't change their mind. But to me, these two discs match the Fillmore concerts every step of the way, due to the quality of the performances as well as the exceptionally clear sound and wonderful three-dimensional mixes.  Very highly recommended.
0739313126|5.0|A work of fiction, based on facts.  Thats the billing and the story is everything promised.<br /><br />This book offers an alternate explanation to the teachings of the Christian Religions with credibility and authority.  I learned more about Leonardo Da Vinci, ancient religions and the Christian Church in historical terms than from any other source.<br /><br />A fantastic story that I could not put down.  Thoroughly reccomended.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I think this CD is amazing! It has the best feel good music. Like whenever i'm not felling good I listen to wicked. I've had the CD for about 2 months and I know every word because they are simple to pick-up on. If you aren't a &quot;showtune's&quot; kind of person you probaly won't like this music as much. Wiked is very  <br /> Brodway showtuney.
B00005JN2X|5.0|This movie embodies all the elements that a good film should; comedy, action, consisancy, intensity, good direction, and good acting. I am not generally a Tom Cruise fan, but I really enjoyed this film.     Cruise is a hitman who has one night to hit all five of the targets on his list. He enlists the help of a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to take him from hit to hit.     Cruise and Foxx have a wonderfully magnetic on screen chemistry. This movie is not in the least serious when dealing with life and death themes. You may even find yourself cheering for the next hit on Cruise's list. Laughing throughout the film is inevitable, although at the same time its intensity draws in the audience.  If you're looking for a fun filled night of intense action and unrelenting comedy, Collateral is not to be passed up.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|Or maybe the place to end up for casual fans who just want one ZZ Top album in their collection. <br /> <br />\\"Rancho Texicano\\" gathers (most of) the best from ZZ Top's rough and tough 70s albums on disc one, and the 80s MTV hits on disc two, and while they shouldn't have ended the set with 12\\" remixes of \\"Legs\\" and \\"Velcro Fly\\" (which are here in their original versions as well), the tracks selection is generally very good, even if it largely ignores the band's 90's efforts.  <br /> <br />There are still plenty of highlights, though, from the band's grittiest early blues-rock stompers \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Francene\\" and the slow grind of \\"Just Got Back From Baby's\\" and \\"Fool For Your Stockings\\", to latter-day smashes such as \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" and \\"Legs\\", and the dirty \\"Pearl Necklace\\". And the fact that this collection is not limited to hit singles means that somewhat lesser-known gems like \\"Waitin' For The Bus\\" and the supremely funky rave-up \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\" are included as well. <br /> <br />The layout is quite nice, the annotation is good without being magnificent, and while this is not quite everything you could ever want from ZZ Top, \\"Rancho Texicano\\" still blows \\"Greatest Hits\\" out of the water.  <br />Unless you want to pick up the 4-disc \\"Smoke, Chrome & BBQ\\" box set right away, this fine career overview provides the best available introduction to the little ol' band from Texas.
B00005JKES|3.0|If you have a cheaper DVD player (like I do, I have a zenith) beware; The menus freeze up if you choose certain episodes. I lucked out because my computer has a DVD player too which worked, but it still felt shaky. However, you have no choice but to buy it. So turn on your TV and your brain and hope the DVD menus don't flake out on you.
B0000029GA|5.0|If Nasir Jones isn't remembered for anything else, he will surely be known for droppin the masterpiece \\"Illmatic\\". Nas' style, wordplay and flow can't even be duplicated and Nas made sure that this debut was perfect. No other album that Nas dropped after this could live up to the expectations of \\"Illmatic\\" and I'm glad it didn't because it shows how much of a a gem this album is. <br /> <br />Illmatic starts off with the short intro \\"The Genesis\\" which symbolizes the beginning of Nas' era. \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\" gets the album off to the right foot where Nas demonstrates his clever wordplay and dropz the classic line: \\"It drops deep as it does in my breath, I never sleep because sleep is the cousin of death.\\" The memorable track \\"Life's A Bitch\\" is next and Nas talks truth to the fullest. The remix which features AZ is a classic where both AZ and Nas bring to us a classic. \\"The World Is Yours\\" is a classic, hip hop track  where Nas rips it out and even spits the line: \\"I'm  out for presidents to represent me\\", the same line Jay-Z used for \\"Dead Presidents\\". Pete Rock even comes along to accompany this stellar track. \\"Halftime\\" is another banger where Nas uses punchline and punchline and combines that with his multi-rhymin a line. \\"Memory Lane\\" is a laid back track where Nas remembers old timez and even tells a story. The masterpiece of Illmatic is the single \\"One Love\\" with Q-Tip. Nas' imagery that he spits in this song makes you actually paint a picture of how life is for many blacks going in and out of jail and dealing with everyone tragedy. Nas gives love to all those in prison and those dealing with loss. The music video is very good also. \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\" is a track that I tend to skip now and then depending on my mood but it's definitely not a bad song. \\"Represent\\" builds Illmatic back up and leads us to the amazing \\"It Aint Hard To Tell\\". I can listen to this song and relate to what Nas is saying just like most of the songs on here. <br /> <br />My only complaint with Illmatic is that I wish it could've had more tracks(at least 3 or 4 more) and it would've surely gotten more praise from me because I know Nas had more material that could've went with this classic. Simply put: the best album of 1994. Go and get this ASAP.
B000002H33|5.0|<br />I can't believe that there are many or any Metallica fans that don't own this one...ALtohugh an argument can be made for Ride the Lightning, in my opinion, Masters stands the test of time better. The album seemed unwordly heavy at the time, but now it seems melodic at times....really an excelent produced album (Don't know why they can't do that anymore) <br /> <br />Here's a song by song: <br /> <br />1) Battery - One of my all time favorite songs. It has everything melow to heavy in the beginning, great changes and musicianship, and power. The lyrics are about being abused as a kid, but I get the sense the Hetfield is fighting back in the song and not whining about it like bands did in the 90's. <br /> <br />2) Master of Puppets - This song rocks.....The changes, vocal structure, and lyrics are awesome. \\"Chop your breakfast on a mirror\\" <br /> <br />3) The Thing that should not be. A slower, but equally heavy track....Kind of takes from the Iron Maiden lyrical theme of a song about HP Lovecraft. <br /> <br />4) Welcome Home - Closes out a perfect first half of MOP. A slower tempo song, almost a ballad, about a guy trying to break out of insane asylum. <br /> <br />5) Desposable Hero's - Always my least favorite song on the album. Not that its bad...just not as good  as the others. My only real compliant is that its too long and repititive...I think if it were 1:00 shorter it would be a better song. <br /> <br />6) Leper Mesiah - An awesome track. Kind of a groovy Heavy Metal track....The most musically unique song on the album. <br /> <br />7) Orion - Ooops Orion is probably more unique then Leper....A classic instrumental. I love the Bass part in the middle...Cliff rocks! <br /> <br />8) Damage INc. - A punk meets Metal tune.....closes out a 5 star album with a bang! <br /> <br />MOP is probably along with Appetite For Destruction the ultimate 80's Metal albums....If you do not own it...your Metal Collectoin is not complete.
B000002LSV|3.0|Well, the music is better than \\"pretty good\\". ZZ Top's tough blues n' boogie is here a-plenty, but there are a few minor songs here, too many MTV-era pop-rock numbers and not enough of their gritty 70s material for my taste. <br /> <br />I know, it's called \\"Greatest Hits\\", so if you only want the hits, I suppose it's all fine and good. But I'd go for the new double-disc anthology \\"Rancho Texicano\\" instead if I was looking for my first ZZ Top purchase...that one paints a much more complete picture of the little ol' band from Texas.
B000002UWW|4.0|..this is a compilation of their early Capitol/EMI days, with \\"Under the Bridge\\" thrown in for good measure..<br /><br />compiled to capitolize on their big crossover success with BSSM, this puts together a lot of good singles and album cuts.. too bad they didn't make it a double cd, but it's good as is..
B00000295Y|3.0|If you don't smoke weed the album is gonna sound terrible to you. It's pretty hard to connect with an album talking about weed and getting high on every song when you don't smoke. The lyrics are decent and the beats are aight. But I think it's an album to listen to when ur high off the chronic smoke
B00006879E|5.0|I would honestly give Maroon 5's 'Songs About Jane' more than 5 stars if it were allowed. I knew them because of the single 'Harder to Breathe' and then became more familiar with them from the 'Love Actually' soundtrack. This CD is all of the things that I hope for in a CD. Perfectly crafted songs that infuse classic R&B, Rock and Pop. This type of artistry displays that Maroon 5 will be a band that will be here for many years to come...No song is worth skipping...it would be like skipping pages in a book. I guess that I don't have to say it here but: I HIGHLY recommend this CD! <br />
B000002KJM|4.0|ZZ Top's 1970 debut remains one of their roughest and certainly bluesiest albums.  It's a gritty little blues-rock record with lots of fuzzy guitar, rollicking barrelhouse rhythms and a raw, gutsy sound, and \\"ZZ Top's First Album\\" offers a handful of really excellent songs, like the tough \\"Brown Sugar\\" (not the Stones song), the swaggering, riff-driven \\"Goin' Down To Mexico\\", and the slow grind of \\"Just Got Back From Baby's\\".    Some may find that a number of these songs glide by on their tough, gut-bucket grooves without offering anything truly memorable, and while it is true that not every one of these ten songs is an instant all-time classic, the overall level is quite high with several peaks and very few let-downs.  This is 34 minutes of tight, well-played blues-rock, as muscular as anything ZZ Top has ever put out. Less MTV-friendly than their 80s pop concessions, of course, but all the more gritty and authentic.  3 3/4 stars. Nice.

There will be 3 seasons released that day, seasons 1 and 2 are on one set, and season 3 will be in another set.  The 3 seasons total will include 24 hours of extras, the article said, including bloopers and never seen before stand up acts, in addition to other things like interviews etc.  All I can say is, IT'S ABOUT TIME!!

B00024BHTC|5.0|Nightwish are back with their best album to date, if you can believe such a thing is possible after the amazing Masterpieces they have already put out. I think it is different than their previous albums, but not extremely so that you would need to be told it is Nightwish (as has happened with other bands, such as Amorphis and Anathema which have gone from extreme doom/death to goth/rock from one album to the next). Tarja's voice is faultless, though she is again most of the time NOT using the pure operatic voice she used on their first 3 albums. She only goes there on a couple of verses on the whole album. She still sings impeccably, though, and still manages to send chills down my spine. If you are a Nightwish fan, this album should definitely be on your wish list, as no true fan of their music will be dissappointed. That said, it is no mere copy of any of their previous work, like I said before - they have progressed, they have matured, and it shows. There is MUCH MORE emphasis on the symphonic/choral elements than ever before, and boy, is that a good thing! In past albums, they have occasionally incorporated a very small number of classical stringed instruments to add color, but mostly, it's been Tuomas' synthesizer that has provided the \\"string section\\" sound. They have also employed (at least according to the \\"Wishmaster\\" CD credits) several singers for a pseudo-choral effect. But on this latest, they are heavily employing virtually a full symphonic orchestra and a choir of about 18 singers. Now they can really be called a Symphonic Metal Band, and a great one at that. I was absolutely enthralled and amazed that they, being already a top-notch, incredible band, could significantly up the ante, and deliver an awesome musical journey, fully utilizing and integrating Classical music into their trademark heavy stylings. An incredible step forward for one of heavy music's most talented institutions. The question is: Can they top this? Maybe not. But, as it stands, they have already secured a very honorable place in the history of Metal.<br />  It is really funny to read the \\"hate\\" reviews which sound like 5 year olds: \\"This album sucks, the singer sucks, they are not original, they are amateurs...\\" bla ,bla bla. They never really provide the reader with a) BETTER musical options, such as really better bands and singers; or b) Valid REASONS backing up their mindless rants. As it stands, none of them really amount to anything worth paying attention to. The fact remains that Nightwish, for those who know music (read my \\"About You\\" area) stand head and shoulders above almost ANY Metal band, EVER. Those who call them amateurs, are below amateur listening experience themselves, and sorely points out their complete lack of musical knowledge. Another funny thing about the haters - most of them have only written 1-2 reviews...hmm...Could it be only one or two people just creating names and writing bad reviews over and over? Could be. I am using the word \\"review\\" just so that you know of what I'm talking about, but really, these little childish rants do not deserve to be called reviews.<br />  Nightwish's entire discography is an amazing body of work: Every succesive album is different and better. Once is their best. It is one of the best Metal albums of the last 10 years. Easily. Facts are facts.hey have already secured a very honorable place in the history of Metal.

B000002BVN|2.0|to overcome all of the bad publicity from his child sex abuse scandal.  That situation created so much negative publicity for him that he had to marry Elvis Presley's daughter just to get the news media to stop talking about the sex scandal.  No album he released at that time was going to have much commercial success. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of Michael's music, but this is a throw-away piece and it was intended as such.  Look at the obvious amount of effort that he has put into all of his other albums, both before and after this one. <br /> <br />This album was damage control, plain and simple.  But I still liked a couple of the tunes.
0783225857|3.0|I'm not going to write a long, monogamous speech about the film because I don't want to spoil it for the people who haven't seen.  It's absoulutely BRILLIANT and I strongly reccommend you should see it.  Any of the uneducated, unappreciative dundder heads who give the film one star shouldn't be allowed to review anything because they have no idea in hell what they're on about.
B000002B1M|4.0|Besides Illmatic this is the next best Nas album with darker beats than Illmatic but less of a powerful lyrical performance.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Hmm...I guess I should say this is another great album of the great rock legends? Well, it is, i can't find anything bad on it, but..i'm sad to find out that the rhcp are really leaving their old times behind to start a new, more soft and melodic era. I didn't know before that they stopped playing their older stuff because of John (thanks to the guy that wrote the previous review)and now that I know...It's a great gesture from other members of the band but it means that this is the end of the smashing-crashing-full-of-energy rhcp. I just hope they won't get even softer in the years to come. <br />But, still, this is a great album!!!The songs are new, though you heard them a thousand times before, john is great (with his guitar and his vocals) and Anthony... well I've always loved Anthony. 'Rolling Sly Stone' is definitely my favourite track, it's a new song, still full of energy (like I said before, there is still some hope for them), you just can't stop;) listening to it. <br /> <br />You must buy this album if you're a true rhcp fan (though I dislike the word fan, it's disgusting, so cheap...)!!!! <br />
B00008EY65|4.0|A spawn from Hell, Rasputin, and Nazis!  And its funny?!  I was truly surprised and pleased with the outcome of 'Hellboy'.  Fearing it was going to be a dark clone of 'X-Men', director Del Toro smartly focuses on the primary character.  Probably becuase he is the most interesting, as said character has real human emotions (lovelorn, angst-ridden, and so forth).<br /><br />Moreover, the 'heavy', Kroenen is simply wonderful as the sheared assassin of Rasputin - rarely in film is a bad guy with no lines so fun to watch on screen (remember the 1st 'Nightmare on Elm Sreet' BEFORE Freddy was given cheesy dialogue?)  Though not as dark as 'The Crow' and not as prepossessing as the last two 'Batman' movies, Hellboy successfully teeters between the two with aplomb.
B00005JN2F|1.0|I hated this movie, as did my wife.      The movie, the plot, the action were all great.  The problem is with the directing and editing.      They hardly held the camera still at all, so we both got nearly sick from all the constant motion.  We felt as if we had just come off one of those rides at the fair that are designed to make you sick.  Even had to close my eyes and/or look away many times.  Was very disorienting to watch.     As far as other reviews which say the handheld camera was bad during the action scenes, I say it was bad during the whole movie.  Hardly ever was a still camera used.  Between action scenes when you want to relax and regroup you couldn't because the handheld camera was still being used.      I didn't time it, but I bet a still camera couldn't have been used more than 5-10 minutes in the whole movie.      Can you imagine being on a tilt-a-whirl for an hour and a half?
B00003CWTI|5.0|Early on, there was fierce discussion, pro and con, about the merits of this film. This has more-or-less settled down now and knowledgeable film buffs seem to agree that this is a gem of a movie. And I donât agree with some of the reviewers that this is an artsy-fartsy movie or a movie â~for intellectuals.â<br /><br />For my part, I love classic action films and American movies, in general. While this is not simply an action movie, it is a VERY excellent movie and already is considered a classic film. It is filled with exquisite performances by some of my favorite actors, folks like William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and of course, Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. While this is a very long movie, it does not seem so. In fact, it is fascinating and it would appear that the cast was inspired, through and through. It is one of the very few movies that I enjoy seeing again. Donât let negative reviews keep you from seeing this for yourself.<br /><br />-- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I bought this album after hearing the song \\"Renegades of Funk\\" at about the time RATM broke up.  This is probably the only band where I've enjoyed ALL the songs on an album.  My taste in music is a bit strange:  My two favorite genres are classic rock and hard trance, which couldn't have less to do with each other.  I'm also a fan of the Beastie Boys, so I guess all the elements fell in to place and allowed me to simply love this album.  As for the previous reviewer, you may want to try Audioslave, considering it's Rage with the lead from Soundgarden as vocals ;).  I don't enjoy them as much as Rage, but that's just because I like how Rocha doesn't hardly sound like any other vocalists I've heard recently.
B0001CLGFK|4.0|This film one can easily play as a proverbial trump card for the banal 'what's the weirdest movie you have ever seen?' conversation.  Eraserhead is Lynch personified - and - unless you have a Master's or Phd in film, you'll be raising an eyebrow virtually through the entire film, as its comprehension cannot really be fully understood.  For example, one will continually stammer 'what the Hell is this?' Or, 'I don't understand what the Hell is going on!'  Nevertheless, its haunting cinematography with its grainy black and white stock and overemphasized sound effects exudes a truly nightmarish tone. One can see how this film inspired Lynch's later works, notably 'The Elephant Man'; 'Blue Velvet'; 'Wild at Heart' even 'Dune'.  This movie is on reputable movie critics' top 20 lists for a reason.  However, much like when trying to find out information regarding 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', Eraserhead cannot be explained, merely witnessed.
B00005JLD4|5.0|It seems that wherever racism exists a fence threatens to be built even to this day. This film is just another example of the world's great racial divide and brings to light the much ignored history of Aboriginal people. <br /> <br />Director Phillip Noyce has created a simple movie with a huge impact. He used real Aboriginal actors and managed to get a mountain of emotion out of the eyes of the three young girls that the movie centers around, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan. The story is based upon a true tale written by one of the central character's children. It begins happily with a beautiful family of Aborigines who exist in Australia during the 1930's, they live off the land in a peaceful existence until the white society decides that the \\"black\\" needs to be blended into the white race and eliminated, hints of Nazism invade here. Camps are set up and girls are captured to be trained and blended into the \\"supreme\\" white society without a care, almost as if they were merely cattle and not actual human beings. <br /> <br />The majority of the film is spent following the three girls through their escape from the camps and into the desert. It is adventurous, thrilling and often horribly sad. The girls encounter people along the way who see them as human and some help is offered through crusts of bread and warm coats. They follow a fence line to find their way back home and end up traveling for nine weeks and over about 1,500 miles. The ending is beautifully touching and well worth the adventure. <br /> <br />I learned something new from this film. I was never aware of what white society tried to do to the Aborigines, yet another horrid aspect of racism not taught in average schools. It seems that Australia committed atrocities towards the Aborigines well through the 1970's and possibly even to this day to some extent. While I am constantly disappointed by humanity and its constant desire to separate the races I was not disappointed in this film. It is a beautiful and heroic saga about the human spirit and the struggle for personal freedom. Let this fence topple all others with its important message. <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Its so obvious that most of these songs are about her boy troubles and falling in and out of love.But on songs like \\"Who Knows\\" and \\"Freak Out\\" have very good general messages.On This CD,the sound is a little more mature,vocally and lyrically. <br /> <br />1.Take Me Away- This song reminds me of \\"Losing Grip\\".This is one of harder songs on the CD.9/10 <br />2.Together- Deep lyrics.Its different from her other songs.9/10 <br />3.Dont Tell Me- This song gets old really fast.Its very radio material.But I like he fact that shes stateing that shes not gonna give up her virginity for just anyone.Good message...boring song.6/10 <br />4.He Wasnt- Honestly,I dont really care for Avril's fast songs....like this one and \\"Sk8er Boi\\".They are just to poppy/perky for me. 6/10 <br />5.How Does It Feel- Nice slow song.A nice song to just sit and think to.I just love her honest lyrics \\"I am young and I am free,but I get tired and I get weak\\"...cool.Love It! 10/10 <br />6.My Happy Ending- I really like this song....not much to say about it...I just like it.10/10 <br />7.Nobodys Home- This is one of the more harder,darker and deeper songs and the CD.Ben Moody(ex Evanescence guitarist)plays guitar on this song.I can REALLY realate to the lyrics.Its about being lost and you cant find your place in life and you just have too many problems.Very deep.10/10 <br />8.Forgotten- Kinda spooky in the beginning.But the song is about speaking out about being left behind and forgotten.I can also really relate to this song.9/10 <br />9.Who Knows- I listen to this song when I am down or when I am hopeless...then Avril speaks to me and says \\"Who knows what could happen,do what you do just keep on laughing,one things true,theres always a brand new day\\" I love this song,good message.10/10 <br />10.Fall To Pieces- By listening to the lyrics,this song is about falling in love and wanting to know everything about that person.I think about my boyfriend when I listen to this song.It makes me love him more.10/10 <br />11.Freak Out- I like the message on this song as well.Its about not caring about what other people think and just living your life to the fullest.This is another song that makes me feel good.The beat kinda reminds me of \\"He Wasnt\\" but not quite as fast.10/10 <br />12.Slipped Away- This song is about Avril's grandpa passing away.Slower song.Very sad.....but not too sad. 9/10
B00005JKC3|4.0|The Hulk is a 2003 film starring Eric Bana. The director shows much expertise, and turns a comic book topic into an epic, excilarating movie. The special edition DVD is packed with dozens of special features, including a character simulation, level of an XBOX game, and many commentaries with the director and producer. The computor technology of today is used in almost every scene in the film. This not a downside, as computors are a contribution to moviemaking. This film is also a remake of \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", a previous version made in the 1960's. The graphics are much improved compared to that version.  <br />     The story is true to the popular Marvel comic book. A determind scientist has developed a mutation device, which he tests on animals. His superiors forbid him to test human subjects. However, he breaks his word and injects his baby with the formula. Years later, the young man has turned into a scientist like his father. One fateful day, he transforms into a green, gigantic, hulking monster. The welfare of New York City is threatened, along with the relationship of his girlfriend. The US Army is called to the case, resulting in a climax that will blast you out of your chair. People with high tech and action tastes will thoroughly enjoy this flick. Be forewarned however, as others will not appreciate some cheesy special effects that the movie has added. Buffs of the particular genre and upbeat type will love the movie and the \\"Massive Features\\" second disc.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|i finally saw this film after all the hype it's gotten.I've always fug Bill Murray&was glad he was finally getting some Props.but anyway this film goes all over the place without making a single statement&becomes one long film that I spent a good hour wondering how it got all the hype it recieved? it has some cool moments,but it doesn't merit all the hype.
B0000CFW87|5.0|After walking into a local records shop, I was struck by the beautiful music playing in the background and wondered who on earth the owner of this heavenly voice could be, whereupon I discovered Josh Groban. That record was his debut album, self-titled.  <br />And since then I have thanked the day that I walked into that record shop and to the amusement of the cashier paid for whatever they were playing on the spot. Anyone who is familiar with his music will understand: if not, I will explain.  <br />Josh Groban is one of those artists that seems to hold his own, that doesn't need publicity but carries his work with that indefinable majesty. Every song he sings he seems to know your emotions, seems to connect with them through the tones of his voice. For such a young voice to carry so much emotion is remarkable. Truly Remarkable. <br />So, after hearing the inspiring, sometimes simply heartbreaking and always BEAUTIFUL debut album, I was rather split. Did I buy the album CLOSER, which I craved just to hear new melodies being commanded by this voice, or did I not buy it and be safe with the debut - would it let the splendour of the first album down? Would his songs sink in to that usually inevitable repetitive genre, that does not inspire, that does not send a shiver up your spine repeatedly and a stirring in your stomach? <br />It was better than the debut album. That's something hard to beat. <br />Only a minute in was I to the first track, that I laughed out loud to the delightful feelings of inspiration the natural power and passion of Josh Groban's voice. <br />If you dear reader are strange to this true talent, then please drop any hesitation you may have. He is not another reeled off singer with an infuriating smirk and shake of the mouth, the only emotions present in the voice being one, of self-satisfaction. Josh Groban is a real vocalist who can play the strings of your emotions as the wonderful string players offering splendid, stunning, 'welling' backgrounds to this PROPER voice of an angel.  <br />I've heard nothing like it.  <br />As one 60 year old friend pointed out on my 16th birthday last night, where we had Josh Groban playing to the black tie garden dinner: \\"His voice makes me want to cry.\\" <br />I think that says it all, do you not?  <br />
0060005424|5.0|Lirael is the second book in the Abhorson Trilogy. This volume takes place many years after Sabriel. (15 years, I think) Lirael introduces the reader to the second (and last) heroin of this trilogy, Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr. The Clayr is a sister sect to the Abhorson line and a protector of the ancient knowledge of their magical realm. They have also been gifted with the sight, the ability to see into the future. <br />The whole book is really an intro to Lirael and her sheltered life. I mean there's a lot to write about when the main character is different than everybody else. The rest of the Clayr are blond outgoing beauties that get the sight around their twelfth birthday, while Lirael is a quiet brunette that is long overdue in the sight department. But being different isn't always a bad thing. If you're the exact opposite of the people that can see into the future well then wouldn't you see into the... *^-^* <br />And yes, Sabriel and Touchstone are in this book. I know it stinks that at the height of Sabriel's story it switches to another character, but it does leave room for the imagination! The Abhorson Trilogy is a must read if you like fiction.
0195067142|4.0|This book, of course, is based on Sledge's notes taken during the campaigns on Peleliu and Okinawa.  (They remind me a little of Manchester's descriptions of Okinawa.)<br /><br />There is no elegant prose here, nor any description of the larger issues involved in the war.  He's not Hemingway.  Every Japanese bullet \\"snaps\\" or \\"whines\\".  But you can hear those snaps and whines, just as you can smell the dead Japanese body that Sledge runs into while digging a foxhole on Okinawa, and just as you can see the fat maggots tumbling out.<br /><br />Sledge may not be one of a kind -- as author or man -- but he's rather special.  He quits a program that keeps him in college on his way to becoming an officer, in order to become an enlisted Marine and reach the war that much more quickly.  He gets used to seeing his buddies cut gold teeth from the mouths of Japanese soldiers.<br /><br />Yet he's disgusted when an officer goes around urinating into the mouths of the corpses.  And wherever he is, he has an eye for nature.  Raindrops splashing around a Marine corps remind him of \\"water babies.\\"  He's distracted on a patrol by egrets.  On Okinawa, when he crosses a clear stream with clean pebbles on the bottom, he thinks about salamanders and crayfish.<br /><br />Sledge survived the war and wound up a professor of biology at a quiet friendly Southern college.  One could hardly have wished for a better life for a man who has been through so much.<br /><br />A warning, though.  If anyone believes that shooting a wounded, fleeing enemy soldier in the back in battle is revolting, he shouldn't read this book because here it happens all the time.
0060273224|5.0|Sabriel (The Abhorson Trilogy) is the most creative and well thought out fantasy book I have ever read. This is a unique novel written by Garth Nix and is in no way similar to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. (No elves, goblins, unicorns, or dwarfs)<br /><br />Sabriel is a young girl out to rescue her father from an unknown force. She inherits a set of bells that have the power to manipulate the dead and sometimes even the ringer can fall victim to their peal. Each bell has its own \\"personality\\" and some of the bells have a dangerous side. These bells must help her in her journey and protect her from those who wish her harm. She meets new friends (including a talking cat) and becomes a true heroin of legend in this story of life, death, and the perils of combining the two.<br /><br />Sabriel is the fantasy novel you've only dreamed of until now.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Michael Mann's latest is one of the best films I've seen this year, so far. From start to finish, Mann's direction doesn't miss a beat and for a two-hour long film, his pacing remains consistent. I never looked at my watch to see how long I've been in the theater from the moment the film began. Even in The Return of the King I glanced down at my watch once or twice.<br /><br />When it was first announced that Tom Cruise will be starring in Collateral many thought right away that he will be the good guy character. It was quite a surprise to most once they heard that he was going to be the villain instead. Even the announcement that Jamie Foxx was cast in the good guy role instead didn't do much to lessen the impact of Cruise being cast as the heavy. Whatever reservations people might have had about Tom Cruise pulling off being a villain in a film should stop worrying.<br /><br />Tom Cruise pulls it off and I must say that this has to be the best work he's done since Magnolia. That's how good Cruise was in Collateral. His portrayal of the assassin Vincent is excellent. I always thought that just beneath the veneer of Cruise's million-dollar megawatt smile existed a darker side. Cruise lets this darker side of his personality come out and shine from beginning to end. His Vincent was calm, collected, charismatic and most of all sociopathic. His character was indifferent as to whether what he was committing was good or bad. Or whether the reasoning behind it was right or wrong. Vincent was indifference personafied. To him it all boils down to the job he had to perform. It was just something he was well-adept and well-versed in performing. Like how Jamie Foxx's character Max was good in how he drove a taxicab.<br /><br />Speaking of Jamie Foxx, he held his own in every scene that he had with Cruise. His Max character represented the Everyman and his work in this film shows just how underrated and underappreciated a dramatic actor he's become. His reactions to the events that unfolded once he took Vincent's fare seems genuine. He reacted like how most people would probably react when they find out that an assassin has now become their bosom buddy for the night. There's real chemistry between Cruise and Foxx. It is this chemistry that holds the film together from start to finish.<br /><br />Collateral was not so much an excellent crime-thriller, but a study of the missed oppurtunities people have in their lives. OF people not living up to their dreams. Always putting off their dreams until the right time came along. Until one day they've realized that their dream has passed them by and that they've become just one of the millions who end up going through life anonymous and forgotten. Vincent lives every day as if it might be his last, but at the same time he's still fears of becoming one of those anonymous millions. His fear is ironic for the reason that his chosen profession he has chosen to remain anonymous if he is to survive. Max on the other hand spends the entire film going through a forced self-discovery of what he's done with his life and dreams. As an audience we're there to see Max go through this journey of self-discovery from beginning to end.<br /><br />For filmgoers who'll be going in to see Collateral hoping to see some action and violence won't be disappointed. There's violence in this film. When it arrives its sudden, quick and brutal. The violence in this film was very similar to the way the swordfighting in Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman was handled. There's no slow-motion gimmicks or overextended shoot outs. When a gun was pulled out and used there was a reasoning to it. This film had no extraneous scenes of violence for the sake of having it onscreen.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Mann's film was an great example of how a thriller can be made intelligently and without using tricks, gimmicks and misdirection. Collateral could've been just about two guys talking inside a cab and it probably still havesucceeded. Its refreshing to know that great direction, great acting, and a flawless script could still be found in Hollywood to create an excellent film.y still have succeeded.

B000286S8S|4.0|I guess that will never happen.  Anyway-Nice collection of songs-although I would have preferred they left off the 3 live Hagar-sings-Roth songs and the UP FOR BREAKFAST track is really a lame sexual word play. C'mon, you're in your 50's grow up.<br /><br />The songs here are all the ones you'd expect, although I would have liked ME WISE MAGIC & HUMANS BEING included. I would have also liked to see the Roth/Hagar songs separated with all Roth on 1 cd and Hagar on the other. While we're at it-why no songs from Van Halen 3? Why no photo of Roth-era Van Halen? I mean, he was a big part of the band's history.<br /><br />Overall a nice overview.

With songs like Peace Sells, Wake Up Dead, Black Firday, and Devil's Island. But now the songs seem even better with the Remakes. You can now hear the album the way it was met to be heard <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|like many other people, i got this cd after enjoying many personal rock out sessions to the single \\"Somebody Told Me.\\" i expected more songs in the same vein and was not disappointed... \\"Jenny,\\" \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" \\"On Top,\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\" all are great songs to blast in your car and drive really fast to whilst singing at the top of your lungs. the rest of the album pleasantly surprised me. there are a few slower tempo songs with more substantial lyrical content. of course, when i say slower tempo, it doesn't mean you'll fall asleep... they still have a catchy, almost mesmerizing beat, but with the added gift of introspective and relatable lyrics. My fave slower songs have to be \\"Smile,\\" and \\"All These Things I've Done.\\" <br />Overall, it's a decent album and a very fun listen. The synthesizer-heavy sound is a great homage to the 80s and Brandon Flowers voice is reminiscent of Ian Brown... all this on a debut album too! The track \\"Change Your Mind\\" is replaced on the UK version of Hot Fuss with \\"Indie Rock and Roll,\\" another very hyped up track. I would recommend anyone to dl it for a more complete Killers sound. fun fun fun...
B000002MP2|4.0|Its been about 10 years since Green Day released Dookie and its still collecting just as much hype as ever. This CD is filled with fast catchy pop punk anthems that ANYONE can enjoy. Its a great album and its alot of fun to listen to. Although it isnt Green Days best, its still excellent and even if youve had it in your collection for a few years, its still very enjoyable. Pick this up if you dont have it. Chances are good that youll love it.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind, nominated for eight Academy Awards, manages to twist enough feeling out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at times ludicrous portrayal of schizophrenia.  Russell Crowe, who endures the role with characteristic fervor of John Nash, was known to be enthralled with Nash to the point where he even attempted to emulate his flurry of hand gestures. The Nobel prize-winning mathematician developed a groundbreaking economic theory while at Princeton, to only be topped by his appearance on the cover of Forbes magazine and to become a professor at MIT, followed by his demise brought on by his schizophrenic delusions. These delusions were portrayed in the film by means of director Ron Howard, but predictably they go astray. Nash begins to believe this \\"altered\\" world is his reality which is populated by a maniacal Department of Defense agent, played by Ed Harris, an imagined college roommate who seems right out of Dead Poet's Society, and an orphaned girl. These characters are represented so favorably that the audience begins to wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as it is depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags the viewer along as he works admirably to carry the film. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life with out the aid of medication is a worthy one, which makes his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.  <br /> There are several important elements in Nash's very influential life that have been overlooked. For one, his most prestigious theory which was the Nash Equilibrium, which is a way of describing how people caught in a strategic decision-making situation may respond based on their assumptions about each others' behavior. Not only is this pivotal element skipped, except for in the fine print of the epilogue, casual viewers may also come away thinking that he was some sort of cross between a paranoid pseudo-code breaker gone awry, and acrazy genius who devised a mathematical approach for picking up women and then forgot all about it. A little less Hollywood depiction would have been nice but the film is still deserving of the four Academy Awards achieved in 2001 for best picture, best director (Howard), best supporting actress (Connelly), and best adapted screenplay (Goldsman). Crowe's depiction of Nash earned him an Academy Award Nomination, which is generous in my opinion.
0756603749|5.0|Pawson's _Handbook of Knots_ is indespensible to the marlinspike sailor, and a useful tool for those who just want to know more about ropework.  The book is organized by type of knot (stopper knots, binding, bends, hitches, loops, plaits and sennits) and has quite a bit about rope care, use, and splicing.  The diagrams are simple and the instructions easy to follow.  Highly recommended.
B000089CJI|4.0|An overall great album - a lo-fi Kraftwerkian synth sound with an indie-rock sensibility.  What struck me first about this cd was the excellent use of the vocals and lyrics in contrast with the low-tech background. It's hardly techno or modern dance - it's a slower, more playful album with great use of vocals and emotion.  My personal favorites are \\"The District Sleeps Tonight\\", \\"Nothing Better\\", and \\"This Place is a Prison\\" (the only track that even slightly reminds me of Depeche Mode, thanks). <br /> <br />In reading several reviews for this album, I'm struck at how many people believe that this album, being synthpop made in the 00's, is revolutionary.  It may come as a huge surprise to some, but there are other plenty of synthpop bands today (outside of your average Depeche/Pet Shop/OMD/Erasure stuff) ... Echoing Green, Neuropa, Iris, Color Theory, Apoptygma Berzerk ... I could go on all day.  While this sound has very little mainstream success, it's never gone away and there are tons of great cd's out there.  Check out [...] if you don't believe me.  Or download an mp3 from Neuropa (Standing Still in Time) or the Echoing Green (The Story of Our Lives) right here at Amazon. It's free, so what do you have to lose?
6304030983|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing. My kids had only been used to videos such as \\"There goes a bulldozer\\" or the Pooh videos. I figured I'd introduce them into the world of \\"big\\" movies with this one. At first I was a bit worried that my two year old would be scared of it, but he did fine. As soon as the movie was over, I had to turn it on again. At the time, my boys were ages 4 and 2. We watched this movie at least twice a day. My husband and I could recite the scenes word for word. And then, alas, they moved on to new movies. I still ask them to watch Jumanji. It's one of my favorites!
0375703764|5.0|This is unlike anything I've ever read. I would say it is my second favorite, if not my favorite book and I read it once (finished it yesterday). Definetly had some paranoia issues, reading it at night and hearing things because this book is truly terrifying. I think that a faceless unknown fear is far more frightning than a monster or something given a body or a face and Danielewski seems to think the same. The book often frustrated me with a lack of answers (though they weren't frequently absent) but it made the book more interesting and definetly more scary. <br />Also, contrary to other reviews, Johnny Truant's story is not bland or boring and something the reader can definetly, definetly relate to. I actually enjoyed Truant's story but would have liked to know more about Zampano as well as the house (despite the fact that the whole book deals with the house, I think it is so fascinating and would have liked the story to be a little longer). The apendices at the end also enhance the last question of the story, the mystery about the story itself, and only make the story more interesting. I did not find this book, while intimidating in legnth and format, to be difficult to read (save for a few parts, but I have a short attention span) and recommend it to any and all who are looking for something out of the ordinary, completely original, and creepy.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|The classical figure of the antihero in western movies reached the highest level with Ride the high country . But when you intend to make a challenging film with this message ; you should care about the script in superlative grade.<br /><br />I have watched this film six times from its initial release to find out its esential values . But yet I only find a sincere tribute , a farewell western picture , an ode to a genre that became in a real inspiration motive for almost five decades in the American Cinema .<br /><br />But the emotion by itself is not enough to hold a film . The hero is tired , he is an outlaw , he accepts the challenge to rescue a little town in a nosthalgical mood who reminds too much to The Seven Samurais dramatic structure but in a twisted gaze . Because Kurosawa approach represents a sociological study of the epic spirit ; this movie goes in the opposite side . Eastwood is not convinced about anything , the dialogues intend to express deep reflections about a long time gone . The role of the young boy trying to grow up in this journey has been told many times before and with major virtues . Freeman is OK and Hackman is a villain too much predictable . There are too much common places and similar situations respect to other and ancient films . Go and watch the Naked Spur , the Outlaw , Warlock or The searchers. In all these movies you find a reason for live . All we know the world is terrible but if you face it with an autunum temperament you do not get even a moral triumph , because only when you have the inner force , the individuality sense you can face the world and fight ; no matter if you win ; what it really counts is the way you do .<br /><br />Keep in mind that in the nineties four films won the Academy Award with the antihero figue : This one , Dance with wolves , Forrest Gump and American Beauty .<br /><br />So the conclussion is obvious . Do not you?
0060755598|5.0|This book is great. Many professional collegues have advised me to read this book if I wanted to excell in my business.  It outlines the steps taken in organizing your business with systems.  Accountability & consistency are key topics. Agreat overall book for those in business for themselves but only own a job and great for those wanting to start a business.  There is great use of anologies and in real life exaples that Gerber uses. READ THIS BOOK 2x at the least and make it your bible.
0064407667|5.0|I learned about \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\" series from watching a \\"CBS Morning\\" segment of the author introducing the books to a captivated audience of children at a bookstore event.  I was intrigued.  I bought the first three books.  Then the next three, and the next three, and...I'm impressed.    The books target age 9 but are enjoyed by all ages, even adults.  The books have so much personality and read aloud well, in case you read a chapter to your children every evening like I do.  The humor is clever and subtle (grown-ups will appreciate it).  The story is exciting, showcasing the Baudelaire children as resourceful, intelligent role models for young readers.      However, as an English teacher, I was especially impressed with the author's ingenious way of lacing the story with definitions of words, which never seems contrived nor impedes the story telling.  Book Two begins by defining the word \\"irony\\"...no kidding!  Can you imagine that in a children's book?    If you're not yet convinced, consider this...I taught a grade 10 special education last year and selected this book for a class novel.  The 30 reluctant readers came to class the next day and said they had read the book overnight!  They couldn't believe they had actually read an entire book and loved it so much and couldn't put it down.  They begged to read Book Two.  The school librarian ordered the entire set, and they've been checked out non-stop ever since the books arrived.  Now that's a recommendation!
B00005JNA2|5.0|Maybe I sound biased because Richard Linklater's 1995 film Before Sunrise is one of my ten or so all time favorite films, but this improved (and I thought that would be impossible!) sequel to an infinitely great film is truly the best film (so far) of 2004. The screenplay, co-written by director Richard Linklater and stars Julie Delpy & Ethan Hawke, is probably one of the most refreshing of this decade. It succeeds on so many levels because of the development of this relationship and the fact that Delpy and Hawke have such a three dimensional knowledge of these complex characters-no, human beings. Fictional of course, but they are still the most humanistic screen \\"couple\\" I've ever seen. <br /> <br />          Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), separated for nine years, are undeniably the soul mates often described in their conversations, the ones that dig deeper than small talk. On a book tour in Paris, where Celine now lives, Jesse finds her watching him through a window as he absentmindedly describes the book he has written, which concerns two fictional lovers who meet and spend a night together-quite obviously autobiographical, when the question is implied by an interviewer. From there on, the two reunite and spend a brief but unforgettable afternoon in Paris, wandering the streets. <br /> <br />          The screenplay and direction are flawless. The dialogue and its delivery is so natural, so uncontrived I was convinced even more that these were real people that I knew. After all, I've waited nine years too (okay, not really, I only saw Sunrise a year ago). Linklater just observes all that is going on without overly glamorizing it. Delpy and Hawke take this dialogue and make it into their own-they are those Celine and Jesse as far as I'm concerned. Some of the best acting this year can be found in Sunset. <br /> <br />          The city of Paris serves as a fluid and dreamlike backdrop to the graceful and powerful, bittersweet and engrossing talk. Sunset is well filmed, and embraces just enough of Paris, which in fact would be more noticeable upon the inevitable second viewing. This city has never looked better on the screen! <br /> <br />          I liked the fact that both Jesse and Celine expressed their true feelings through an art form, he with a book, and she with a song. This clearly conveys the message that there still exists romanticism in each of them despite each characters' biting cynicism. Although they never once said a word along the lines of \\"I love you,\\" you know throughout the entire film that they are still in love with each other. Maybe I am reading too deeply into this film, but I strongly believe that the first place that the two go, the caf, is almost like a complete reenactment of the train sequence in certain ways-it is the beginning of their journey and each place is mutual ground where Jesse and Celine are not under pressure, but they can just talk without interruptions or worries about the past. <br /> <br />          By the time the ending came around, I held back tears in my eyes-out of happiness for these characters. If a film can do that, it's a winner in my mind. Those last words of the film leave you wanting more, but they are also brilliant and have stuck out in my mind amidst the philosophy and deep discussions. I won't ruin it, but the ending is just so amazing because you know that something good is going to happen. <br /> <br />          Do yourself a favor and see Before Sunset before it's too late, and then buy yourself the soundtrack as a memory of this beautiful film so that it is not forgotten until the DVD release.  <br /> <br />THE VERDICT: **** (A)
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot has been my favourite band and i still listen to both their full lenghts, but this cd is sell out. It's pretty catchy though, and it's Slipknot.
B000023VR6|5.0|First I would like to say this is a pretty good follow up to Dr. Dre's first classic album, \\"The Chronic\\". I can't decide whether or not it's better than the Chronic or not yet, but I do know this gives it a big run for it's money. Despite the overwhelming array of guest appearences, (Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Nate Dogg, Devin the Dude, Hittman, MC Ren, and some females that I don't know the name of, to name a few) the album is a classic. The guest appearences don't hurt it that much, but it does seem to me that their is more guest appearences than Dr. Dre himself.<br /><br />The album starts out with an intro called Lolo. The very start sounds just like a start to an old movie on surround sound. Then we head in to the \\"Watcher\\". I don't know what it is about the song that makes me skip it, but I usually skip to the next. It's a good song, but I skip it. Part 2 is on Jay-Z's \\"Blueprint 2\\". The next song, \\"F**k You\\" is basically about sex. Despite the very sexually explicit lyrics, I always listen to this song. It's pretty good. \\"Still D.R.E.\\" is a great song with a great beat to match. It talks about how Dre hasn't fell off but how he's still Dre. \\"Big Ego's\\" is an above average song as well. I especially like the chorus, and how it is said. This one never gets a skip either. \\"Xxplosive\\" is my favorite on the album. I absolutely love the beat to it. With Nate Dogg dropping his vocals on the song too, it really has that nice west coast feel to it. \\"What's The Difference\\" is pretty cool with Eminem on it. His verse has him going on about how he would kill Kim. Pretty good lyrics on the song, and a nice beat. \\"Bar One\\" is just a skit. \\"Light Speed\\" is an okay song. It would get a skip sometimes, sometimes it wouldn't. I do like the chorus on the song though. \\"Forgot About Dre\\" is another hit off the album. Eminem is excellent off the chorus. You've probably heard it before so what's there to say about it? \\"The Next Episode\\" is a great hit also. Both Dre and Snoop drop great verses, and Nate Dogg at the end was great. You can also get this on \\"The Source Hip Hop Hits Vol. 1\\".<br /><br />\\"Let's Get High\\" is another song about getting high and having sex. However, I still listen to it all the time because the beginning of it is rather catchy, and the verses are okay. \\"Bitch Niggaz\\" is a little too slow for me to listen to. Snoop Dogg also appears on the song, but it's just too slow. The rest of the songs are a little mediocre, but still listenable. \\"The Message\\" though is very emotional song with Dre spitting his heart to God. Mary J. Blige makes an appearence on it. It's always worth a listen.<br /><br />So, if you liked the Chronic, (and haven't picked this up yet) I would suggest you pick it up soon. You'll get your moneys worth on it. Definitly a 5 star album.t verses, and Nate Dogg at the end was great. You can also get this on \\"The Source Hip Hop Hits Vol. 1\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Let's Get High\\" is another song about getting high and having sex.

0694013889|5.0|Goodness gracious. I do wish people would calm down about the terminology used in these books. The author writes a nice little note indicating that she used her preferred terms and encourages parents to CHANGE them to whatever they wish to use when they read the book to their pre-literate children, who won't know the difference. No, I do not say pee pee and wee wee when I read this to my daughter. I use terms I prefer. Likewise, I often change the text in books when I read them to my daughter if I don't care for the text as written for some reason or another. Additionally, my daughter knows that the chamber pot pictured in the book is a potty, and our \\"big toilet\\" is a potty, and the cat's litter box is a \\"kitty potty\\" but she doesn't crawl in there or void in my potted plants for that matter....This is a cute little story with sweet pictures and a simple story line. The potty doesn't sing, clap, play music, or hand Prudence a sticker...it just provides her a place to go that might be preferable to her (gasp) cloth diaper. My daughter enjoys the book greatly and will select it (in addition to several other favorite non-potty books) to listen to/look it while she uses her own potty. I personally like that it avoids any implication that if one is a \\"big\\" boy or girl that they should potty or that diapers are for babies. There is no mention of Prudence's age or of any timeline relative to how long it takes her to to master the potty. It mentions that accidents may happen and there is no suggestion of a good or bad consequence as a result. The book provides a framework without shame or pressure for sweet Prudence and leaves it to the parent(s) to fill in the rest for their child as/if they wish.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Personally i'd rather stick hot sewing needles in my eye or listen to lil jon and lil scrappy, this album is horrible, between the BS lyrics and Eminem on almost EVERY SINGLE CHORUS whining his pathetic pale tail off I think everybody who bought this CD deserves a refund, this crap isn't even worth downloading, and this fool had the nerve to try to battle on record with Canibus awhile back? suggestion: listen to the Curriculum 101 and see who got the \\"last laugh\\", then go listen to Royce the 5-9's new album and see what a contentious idiot Eminem is for dropping the nicest emcee he had on his rooster, Kon Artist need to go solo and do his own thing, you know how it is with talent, if you got 9 broke friends you're bound to be the tenth and d12 will drag him down with them, I can tell by this album Eminem's next cd is going to be weak, along with all those terrible DJ Green lantern releases(maybe 2 out of 20 were good) he actually could of got a Dj with skills like Hi Tek or Spinbad, but he chose to get somebody who's exactly like the rest of the shady/aftermeth crew \\"mediocre\\", if I could i'd give this CD 0 stars, this is almost as bad as listening to the radio and hearing ushers wack song 8 times in a row
B000002H6C|5.0|this is another amazing cd,  a lot of people think that master of puppets is a lot better than this cd, i disagree. i do love master of puppets though.  probably the best tracks on this cd are \\"harvester of sorrow\\", \\"dyers eve\\", \\"one\\", and the title track \\"...and justice for all\\".  i definitely recommend this cd to any metal fan.
0345446798|3.0|First off this is a great book for reading your dogs body language.  I do think new dog owners should read this as a primer before getting a dog as it would help cut down on miscommunication between dog and person.  I work in the pet field and that is one of the major issues I have seen and it results in either poor training or the dog being blamed for something they can't control.  But.....I do have a bone to pick. <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers that the book is too \\"talkative.\\"  It was hard to follow in parts due to the author sharing expierence stories rather than how-to knowledge.  A more streamlined approch would have been helpfull. <br /> <br />Also, I can't get over the fact that Ms. McConnell felt it necessary to remind us constantly about the fact she has a PhD and what a fantastic behaviorist she is.  Come on!  I know she is well repected but I don't think her ideas are all there are in training.  I didn't like the feeling at the beginning of the book that she feels she is the best trainer and behavorist in the whole wide world and if you don't go by what SHE tells you, well then it's your fault your dog acts up. And by the way, she has a degree in this and this.  Personaly, I think you need to take her with a grain of salt.  There are many different training systems out there, and a person really does need to do their research as to what is best for them and the dog. <br /> <br />I guess the bottom line is it is a great book on body languge once you wade through all the self gratification and stories.
B000063DFN|5.0|classic iron maiden, its definitely worth whatever your local music store charges you for it.  The best tracks on this one are \\"powerslave\\" and \\"aces high\\".  a definite must for any metal fan.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Every action film has its implausibilities.  I would say that is a given.  In real life, there aren't intense multi-car high way chases, there aren't stylized shoot-outs as graceful as a feather's descent from atop a building.  The wonder of cinema is that it is allowed to play with our imaginations until we burst with an excitement experienced only within the shadows of the theater.    There are a mere few minor instances in 'Collateral' where we are forced to think, \\"Hm, that's not entirely possible...but who really cares?\\"  None ruin any of director Michael Mann's credibility.  Consider a shoot-out within a bustling techno dance club.  Tom Cruise as Vincent, a dangerously apathetic and charismatic hit man, manages to hit every one of his targets perfectly without once injuring or killing a single innocent person.  Would this perfectly carried-out plan, not once messy or accidental, exist in reality?  Probably not.  But the benefit I find in minor realism issues in action flicks is that it allows us to be in another place where our hearts can pound as we witness the chilling accuracy of a man who already haunts with no more than a glance reminiscent of a fox.    Tom Cruise portrays this Vincent surprisingly well.  He is a character I've never seen Cruise tackle.  I have to say, I found that refreshing.  Walking into the theater, I was afraid I'd see his \\"pretty boy\\" persona, but with a grey wig rather than the usual black.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  While not quite as Oscar-worthy as many people had hoped, Cruise amazes and enthralls with a cunningly crafted personality and wolf-like humanity.  Killing is his nature.  Cruise manages to make us believe he thinks of humans as stars: there are so many that the death of one couldn't possibly matter.  I loved when he compared the death of one man to a massacre in Rwanda.  The screenplay really provokes solid thought often absent in many thrillers thrown at us these days.    Playing off of Cruise's wonderful performance is Jamie Foxx as Max, a mild and passive L.A. cab driver who picks up Vincent by chance after dropping off Annie Farrel (Jada Pinkett Smith), a woman he could have a date with if he weren't so self-contained.  Though not quite as interesting as Vincent, Foxx's Max is truly human; we want him to survive Vincent and his job to assassinate five witnesses in a current case.  Pinkett Smith's tenderness only elevates the human part of 'Collateral.'  Toward the end, Smith and Foxx together enhance the excitement as we hope and wish they avoid every obstacle they come across.    The city of Los Angeles also plays a role in the film, thanks to gorgeously appropriate digital cinematography that captures the night life and the eerie silence of a city when all but a few have sunken into dreams.  Mann lends a hand in combining the city and character study going on within the cab.  The climax is swiftly followed and executed, only underscoring his skill as a director.  In fact, this is probably his best work since 'The Insider.'  His flawless direction alone was worth the price of admission.  But what I found missing in this piece was more of an emotional foundation.      Though there is obvious connection between Vincent and Max (the effects of which are geniously and interestingly scattered in between the hits), sometimes the cop story lagged on a bit in places where the criss-cross of personality could have been elaborated upon.  'Collateral' is not a perfect film.  But then again, what is these days?  It still manages to get your heart racing.  As the credits role, you feel utterly satisfied, a feeling rare among modern cinema.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Unique rock movie. I love the soundtrack too. Oh Hedwig I adore you , even in your bit@#hy moods! Glad to say I own it. One of the best music movies out there.
B00004YW6I|2.0|This is by far her worst album.  I'm not sure if it was intended as an f-u to her old fans or if she was really trying to sell out, but she seems to have forgotten what has made her unique.  Here PJ is trying to make herself into a Lillith fair chick, having forgotten that there no longer is a Lillith fair.  There are a couple decent songs here, but overall this is the only album of hers that I can say is a really bad one.  \\"We Float\\"?  I mean come on.  What happened to, \\"douse her with gasoline\\"?  Under no circumstances buy this album or accept it as a gift.
0783117523|5.0|Oh my gawd! Everytime i see this film I end up in tears. This is a great film about how drugs can ruin everything - even for the well meaning. Breaks my heart everytime. And the scene where Jolie says \\"you were always the one\\"- gulp! WAHHHH! I keep getting tempted to buy it when I see it, but it makes me cry so. Great acting.

B000002L9M|5.0|I'm young. All of these reviews seem to be written by adults who listened to this album way back when. But I just discovered DM, and I'm listening to 'Black Celebration' and it's wonderful. All of the songs are great. I think I'll try abother one of their albums. They make my happy. \\"Death is everywhere/There are flies on the windscreen.\\"-DM 'Flies on the Windscreen'
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I am really hesitant in going to watch war movies. I have seem too many. So, I was hesitant to go and see this one. However, I heard the movie was good and that there was the &quot;love&quot; element in it which my wife would like. We went to see it and we weren't disappointed. This movie has some very explicit sexual scenes which we don't think were necessary (a minister with a lady) but that's hollywood. I loved the music, it was different and creative. We found it soo ironic that the main character survives soo much (the war, the journey home) and dies very tragically right after being reunited with her lover.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After a friend of mine invited me over to watch the two hour pilot episode of Firefly, I was simply amazed. Each of the characters has their own background, motives, and development throughout the series. That alone puts this show well above most everything else on television today. The soundtrack is great, the plots are captivating, the dialog is witty and interesting, the theme song has meaningful lyrics, the visuals are stunning, space really _is_ silent, the doors don't follow the script, and the mixture of the western and sci-fi genres is convincing. <br /> <br />Anyone can fall in love with this show. After watching a few episodes with my friend, I ordered my copy the next day.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Wow! Where was I when this flick came out?  It is a great spy movie equal to the best of the classic Cold War spy movies.  I guess I soured on spy movies after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  In their quest for new villains, Hollywood made big business the new boogey-man.  Oh, um . . . unless you are a foaming at the mouth liberal, big business does not make a very good villain.  How many post-Cold War movies I have seen where some corporate evil businessman attempts to wreak havoc on human kind for the sake of profit.  What is totally unbelievable about these movies is that very rarely can a leader move hundreds, if not thousands of people to do his bidding without an ideology behind it.  People just will not kills thousands of people, put the human race at risk, let alone putting ones own life at risk so some greedy corporate suit can make more money.  History has shown that people seldom will risk their lives so their boss can make more money, but they will willingly lay down their own lives for a religious or political ideology to motivate them.   Hitler got men to kill millions in order to purify the white race; Moslem extremists get young people to strap bombs on themselves and blow up innocent women and children in order to reclaim Palestine and kill Jews; The Crusaders willing gave up their wealth and lives to liberate the Holy Land from the Moslem occupiers. It takes ideology to motivate people. <br /> <br />The Bourne Identity avoided this pitfall by focusing in on a event that one could believe in- the CIA attempting to kill and African despot who was going to publicly  identify CIA operatives.  Matt Damon was superb for the part. No, he does not look at James Bond, that that is the point- He is an ordinary looking guy.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the very end.  I cannot wait to see the sequel.  <br />

6304696566|5.0|By the time this movie came out, John Ford, its director, was already a legendary filmmaker. With a career reaching back to the mid-teens, he had already nabbed his four Oscars and solidified a legacy of being perhaps the greatest directors of all time, and this film certainly proves him to be at the pinnacle of his artistic mastery. It also represents the incredible resiliency of its star, America's number one war hero and cowboy, John Wayne, (and I should say also his public's loyalty), who previously in the same year made one of the worst movies of anybody's career, The Conqueror, in which he portrayed Genghis Khan. Taken from Alan LeMay's 1954 novel of the same name, The Searchers explores the emotionally complex story of a perilous, hate-ridden man called Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), and his Homeric-style odyssey of self-discovery following a Comanche massacre, while also diving into the themes of racial prejudice and sexism.  <br /> <br /> Ford lures us from the beginning into this simultaneously gorgeous and volatile desert world as Ethan emerges from the sand and the buttes, a drifting, lonely man on horseback returning to his family after a three year absence. During Ethan's stay with the family, a group of Comanches attacks the frontier home while he and the other men are away, killing everyone except his two nieces who are kidnapped: a teenager named Lucy (Pippa Scott) and a ten-year-old named Debbie (Lana Wood, later played as a teenager by Natalie Wood). From here, it becomes a meandering tale that probes the inner psychological turmoil of this fiercely independent man obsessed with revenge and hatred, who, along with his half-Cherokee nephew Marty (Jeffery Hunter), searches for his nieces for over five years.  <br /> <br /> Obviously the western has waned in popularity in the last two decades - Open Range ended a decade-long drought - but it is really the one true distinctive American genre, the oldest, and also the most abundant. The Searchers is regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Rightly so. It's epic, it's complex, with moments of humor, visually-gorgeous, reflecting Ford's training as a painter, and it's John Wayne's greatest performance, ever. His favorite, too - he even named his son Ethan. And the most stirring part of the film is probably this visual motif of a framed doorway: it begins with a door opening, and ends with a door closing, but in both scenes, on this threshold between two worlds, John Wayne stands alone. In the end, John peers briefly back through the doorway into the home, wherein lies the warmth of a settled family, a civilization he can never know, before turning back into the savage and threatening glare of the western frontier that has and always will be his home.
0553579908|3.0|Let me first say that I enjoy this series and am looking forward to reading A Storm of Swords. I rate Clash of Kings at 3 stars, because I must unfortunately compare it with its predecessor, Game of Throne-- which was far more focused. I have to admit I am also missing the absence of a particular character I came to admire very greatly in the first novel. Clash of Kings wanders in the first half and offers at least one unnecessary point of view (Theon). By the second half, Martin brings it back into focus, with Tyrion and Catelyn serving as the binding forces of the novel. The inclusion of Melisandre seems somewhat forced and is treated often like an afterthough, though I do like how magic is gradually slipping back into the fabric of these people's lives. I will continue reading the series, especially as I am anticipating the next volume to be a vast improvement over this one and hopefully more reminiscent of Game of Thrones.
B00006LLLN|4.0|The 2004 Grammy winner for best Bluegrass CD is a great introduction to the music of Alison Krauss & Union Station. Ms Krauss has one of the most beautifaul voices in music today, making good songs great & great songs wonderful.  <br />     My favorite song here is a cover of the Foundations classic Baby, Now That I've Found You. Let Me Touch You For Awhile, The Lucky One, Take Me For Longing & When You Say Nothing At All round out a top notch CD. Contributions by Union Station (Dan Tyminski on Bright Sunny South, Ron Block on Faraway Land) & instrumentals (Choctaw Hayride & Cluck Old Hen) only make this collection better.    <br />     Recommended for country/bluegrass fans. <br />
1400032717|5.0|A great peek into the mind of an autistic boy. A simply told tale that keeps you wanting to turn the page. Mark Haddon has created a character that readers will want to hold close to them, but of course you can't.
B00008EY9G|3.0|Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller. As 10 strangers (including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm, suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst. Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far, far away from the motel.<br /><br />For about 60 minutes, this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked. Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. But it came too early and led the film into stupidness.<br /><br />It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool, even if it doesn't last very long. But, in the end, I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this. But what do you expect from the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman?<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are a bunch of extras I don't care about.
B000084T18|1.0|I bought this album based on all of tha hype. But after I heard it I took it back. This album is horrible. I still wonder how all these no talent punks get signed. I remember when people had to HAVE talent to get signed. His flow is horrible. Tha lyrics = gay. He is not A thug, gangsta, etc. Him and his fuccin gimmick about gettin shot. If you want real gangsta rap go and buy tha greatest rap album ever, Bone Thugs~N~Harmony - E. 1999 Eternal
B00004Y87J|5.0|The mysterious woman Annabella warns Mr. Hannah of the men who tailed them to Mr. Hannah's apartment building.  She asks him, \\"Have you ever heard of the thirty-nine steps?\\"  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hannah is on the run, fleeing to Scotland, wanted for murder but with a mission to find someone in Scotland he doesn't even know.  The story is based on the book of the same name written by John Buchan/Lord Tweedsmuir, a favorite author of JFK.  The movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, came out in 1935.<br /><br />This movie is maybe not as thrilling or horrifying as some of Hitchcock's later movies but is still good.  And has Hitchcock ever made any bad movies???
B00005JN2X|4.0|Michael Mann gives us another good film.  This time, he really uses the actors to convey a great movie.  Moving away from his regular type-casting, Tom Cruise plays a hitman named Vincent.  In the driver's seat, is taxicab driver Jamie Foxx.  His name is Max.  Now that they are introduced to each other, the night begins.   <br /> <br />Vincent offers Max $600 to drive him around to make his \\"runs.\\"  Max gives in and takes Vincent for a spin.  They start off with good conversation and seem to have a friendship starting.  After his first stop, Max is eating a sandwhich in the car when a body falls four stories on top of it.  He realizes that Vincent caused the falling body, and now, he knows what he is dealing with.  For the sake of his own life, he continues to drive Vincent. <br /> <br />They make another stop to exterminate another guy.  No biggie, just part of the job.  Then they go to a jazz club.  Max believes Vincent is just going there to buy the two a round of drinks.  He later realizes, that there is another target at the club.  Vincent murders this guy in front of Max, and he sees Vincent at work first hand for the first time. <br /> <br />Then, Max gets word that his mother is worried about him.  Turns out, his mother is in the hospital, and he always visits her when he gets off of work.  In order to not make suspicion, Vincent tells Max they need to visit the hospital.  While there, Max steals Vincent's briefcase, which has his list of targets inside it, along with other things like money, ammo, and such.  From here, Vincent chases Max, but Max throws the case over a bridge, and everything is lost.   <br /> <br />So, they must go see a man at a club to get a new list.  Here, Max has to pretend and pass as Vincent.  Max has to go in because Vincent cannot reveal his identity.  So, the FEDS believe Max is Vincent, but a narcotics officer (Mark Ruffalo) knows the truth.  When they go to a club for the next victim, trouble stirs, but the job is done. <br /> <br />After this incident, Max decides he must take command.  So, he wrecks the vehicle, and Vincent runs away.  Max believes his night is over, but realizes that the next target on the list is of a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) that he had given a ride to earlier that night.  So, now, he must turn into a hero a save the girl.  This leads to a high speed chase on foot that is a race against the clock and Vincent. <br /> <br />This movie is really good.  A lot of the film depends on the acting and the quality of the acting.  Can you see Tom Cruise as a villain?  You can after seeing this film.  Cruise really does have a wider range of acting than that big-smile good guy type.  He still has his smile, but it even looks sinister.  It may be his best performance since the film Magnolia. <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx is also very good.  Most of the film works on the two main character interacting with each other.  Foxx is able to display his emotions to the point.  I thought he was good in Any Given Sunday, but here, you know that he can really do more than comedy.  He's grown up since his days on In Living Color. <br /> <br />Collateral really does grip the audience.  You cheer for both characters.  A lot of people are seeing this movie to see Tom Cruise as the bad guy.  That's a good thing because he gives a great performance.  He's an actor.  He does it for a living.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Worth every penny, Avril is extremely talented. She stated that when she was writing for this cd she had more music in her but that they had to tell her to stop so that they could get the cd out in time. Her first cd was a tad too young sounding for me (much like He Wasn't, which is my least fave song on the cd), but this cd is much better, I can only imagine what her next cd will sound like.  My favorite songs are Nobodys Home, Together, and Slipped Away (written for her grandfather after he passed away).
B00005JN2X|5.0|Michael Mann is one of those directors where you either love him or you hate him. There's something about his films, something that catches the certain spirit or aspect of a time period or a culture, or even a city. In 'Manhunter', Mann follows Will Graham in an 80's fused film loaded with a memorable, hand picked soundtrack with the likes of Prime Movers or Iron Butterfly. His work on 'Heat' and 'The Insider' both gave this eerie, yet calm outlook on violence and the media, respectively. In comparison, Mann's work is like waking up from an afternoon nap and seeing every color in infinite detail, it's like you never looked at it that way before. There's nothing different here in his new masterpiece, 'Collateral.'<br /><br />First off, this review isn't bias because Tom Cruise is my favorite actor, in fact, it's more critical. As far as I'm concerned, this was a film for Tom Cruise to finally have a title character other than Lestat or Jerry Maguire. You remember Cruise in every film, but there is acting and being a different character altogether. In 'Collateral', those in the realm of film will know his character, Vincent.<br /><br />Vincent is the type of guy at the airport you glance at and that's it. In a way, he blends, but if you looked even closer, you'd notice how much different he is. Vincent is a contracted killer and he's very, very good at it. In fact, this is his life. So take him, throw him in LA, add a hit list, and a cabbie named Max(Foxx), and you have one hell of a ride, literally.<br /><br />As in any Mann film, the acting and realism is top notch. Much like his work on 'Heat', real cops and detectives were used, including Cruise and Foxx's own stunts, to add to the integrity of the film. Add this with the well produced use of camera work, something which failed miserably in 'The Bourne Supremacy', and the film really works. I haven't felt so involved with a film in a long while. By the end of the film, you really take in a scope of LA and the backstreets and really grab the feel of the area. I was surprised where I was by the end, no joke.<br /><br />Cruise and Foxx work brilliantly. I'm glad Sandler didn't fill Foxx's role, as the film would have taken a slight turn, maybe for the worse, maybe for the best, I don't know. What I do know, is that this combination works, and it shows. I hope come Oscar's, this film doesn't take the backseat. Both Foxx and Cruise give astonishing peformances. As do Mark Ruffalo, of whom makes a minor role, and the breathtaking Jada Pinkett Smith, who I find to be one of Hollywood's attractive and better actresses.<br /><br />With use of Audioslave's song, I really felt for this film. I was glad The Roots also took a part in the beginning, and I also loved the instrumental scores. I would even buy the soundtrack, it's really great, but this is no surprise, given it's a Michael Mann film. Everything went really well and I never felt the soundtrack aspired to be what the film wasn't.<br /><br />The film, at least for me, works very well. It's never too choppy, the shots are fantastic, the story works well, and the dialogue is terrific. There are even a few laughs in here. Everything blends well and I think it's all to owe to the amazing cast, beautiful direction, and the simplistic but well produced screenplay by Stuart Beattie. I'd say this is the summer's best so far. I cannot wait for this to arrive on DVD and furthermore, might even see it again. I haven't really read too many reviews here yet, but so far it seems people tend to agree.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />Even Tom Cruise agrees with that.the feel of the area.

B0002EXH5E|2.0|This was obviously Dave's attempt at making his equivalent to Metallica's Black Album (although Mr. Mustaine blames the producer.) The logo change (which is not seen on remaster) even resembles the Metallica logo from \\"Load.\\" <br /> <br />Oh well, it didn't work. I guess it was worth the RISK!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|The Best Film of 2003.  Even with all the hype of The Lord of the Rings, I feel that Cold Mountain is the year's best film.  I know I am in a minority, but I connected with this film like no other movie I have ever seen.  The story was beautifully told, and the cinematography, acting, and production design blended wonderfully.  Renee Zellwegger deserved her Oscar, SAG, and Golden Globe 150%.  Jude and Nicole along with the supporting cast were great too.  I reccomend this movie to everyone.  A five star film.
B00003CX9E|5.0|the negative reviews of \\"citizen kane\\" on this site seem to have one thing in common: whether the viewer fell asleep while watching, had to fast-forward to get to the end, or finished it but found it slow and boring, none of these reviewers seems to have returned for a second viewing.  and this is the crucial problem.    \\"citizen kane\\" is a film that will require a second (or even a third) viewing.  why?  well, think about your favorite song for a moment.  do you remember the first time you heard it?  did you love it then the way you love it now?  if not, i suspect you grew to love it more and more over time as you became more familiar with its lyrics, its structure, its rhythms and its textures.  appreciating \\"citizen kane,\\" like appreciating great music (or, for that matter, great art of any kind) requires dedication and time.    there's a reason why the film is paced the way it is.  there's also a reason for the film's complex structure.  it's a portrait of a man's entire life, recounted by those who knew--or thought they knew--him best (notice that the narrative is never from kane's point of view).  and so it turns out to be a film not about charles foster kane himself, but rather about the way he is remembered by his friends and enemies.  and the final sequence, when you reach it, is truly heartbreaking.  the meaning of \\"rosebud\\" is revealed, but notice how that forces us to reevaluate all that has come before.  sure, we know what \\"rosebud\\" is, but we should ask ourselves what that means.  how well did all these people really know kane?  how well do we now know him?       there is so much to love here if you'll only give it a chance.  so, you've already seen the film once and now it's time for your second viewing.  brew yourself a strong cup of coffee, sit down and get comfortable, and start from the very beginning (no fast-forwarding this time).  if you find a shot that you like, pause it and look a little closer.  if you don't understand a scene, rewind and look at it again.  just as you would with a great part of a song, or with that word or two that you can't quite hear, allow yourself to linger over details and explore uncertainties.  this is how \\"citizen kane\\" will grab you and make you care.    and, well, if it still doesn't work for you, then come back and post another review.  i bet what you have to say the second time will be much more interesting than your initial lament.
B0000035E7|4.0|This album is worth way more than only 35,000 copies, it should have gone Platinum. This album only recieved airplay in Seattle and around there, and that was pretty much it. Maybe it was because they didn't have a video for any songs or they didn't have a major record label until Nevermind. Oh well, I guess I'll start off by saying that \\"About a Girl\\" is an amazing song and that's the first reason why it got 4 stars. Also, \\"Blew\\" and \\"Negative Creep\\" are very good songs but \\"Floyd the Barber\\" is not that good at all but it's the only one with a major problem.  <br /> <br />Guitars - Amazing and not repetative <br />Bass - Thick and loud <br />Drums - It's okay, I wish they had Grohl before Nevermind <br />Vocals - Sings the right way <br />Lyrics - Very good, much better than In Utero <br /> <br />Oh and for the record. All Nirvana-haters (or people that just don't like them) need to stop stereotyping fans. You can hate them all you want, you are entitled to your own opinion but stop saying that fans hate themselves and hate Nirvana-haters since one of my friends IS a Nirvana-hater. I'm not gonna get pissed at you but just remember what I wrote. <br /> <br />THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO \\"CURE MY ILLS \\"JAKE\\"\\"
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I bought this movie and liked it so much I saw it 3 times in 2 days, if you like sci fi you will definetly enjoy this movie, it is very good from begining to end. <br />I will not say a lot about the plot, only that this movie deals with the consequenses of changing the past, it is a powerfull film, strong and original. <br />There are 4 different endings, worth watching.
B000002H33|5.0|The final work of bassist Cliff Burton, and he sure made it great. Cliff is among my top 10, no wait, top 3 favorite bassists of all time with Chris (or Krist, I don't know) Novoselic and John Paul Jones. He was a great guy and his bass in this album is very thick, loud and intense. Right, I'll rate the songs: <br /> <br />Battery (9\10): Very heavy and has a spanish intro but it's only just over five minutes. <br /> <br />Master of Puppets (9\10): A long song filled with great guitar riffs and pounding drums, but after a while it's not that great. <br /> <br />The thing that should not be (8\10): I'll start off by saying I am not a fan of the vocals here, but nonetheless it has a great beat. <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 10\10: My favorite song on the album (and it definately beats Nothing else Matters). This has a great bass intro by musical genius Cliff Burton and when it kicks in you won't believe your ears. <br /> <br />Disposeable Heros (10\10): Greatness, what else can I say? <br /> <br />Leper Masiah (6\10): Did I spell it right? Well anyway this song isn't that good mainly because it's nothing compared to the previous songs. <br /> <br />Orion (5\5): I rate instrumental songs out five (vocals are half). This is a great instrumental with an awesome bass solo by Cliff Burton (again) and great guitar riffs. <br /> <br />Damage Inc. (8\10): I can't really explain this one... <br /> <br />Guitars (James Hetfield)- great rhythem and riffs <br />Guitars (Kirk Hammett)- Awesome guitar solos (duh) and fast paced beats usually. <br />Bass (Cliff Burton)- GREATEST BASSIST EVER!!! <br />Drums (Lars Ulrich)- Thunderous, complex and pounding. Perfect. <br />Vocals (James Hetfield)- Loud and melodic at the same time, brilliant. <br />Lyrics (Hetfield\Ulrich)- Greatness (this doesn't apply to \\"The Thing that Should not be\\"). <br /> <br />If you enjoy the complex Metallica then get Kill 'em All first, then buy Ride the Lightening and then buy this one. If you enjoysimple Metallica then follow this order: <br /> <br />Reload, Load, Black Album, Master of Puppets, Kill em' All, Ride the Lightening, ...and Justice for all (DONT GET ST. ANGER) <br />
B0002HTZJI|5.0|but first to the guy who said this album was a disgrace...You obviously don't know that the red hot chili peppers have stopped playing anything pre-Blood Sugar Sex Magik besides me and my friends (when joh wasnt even in the band) because of john's hatred of himself during that stage of his life.  For you to say by the way is a disgrace is just disturbing. how can you call yourself a red hot chili peppers fan?  by the way is a great album and is just different from all their other albums.  But come to think of it, have the red hot chili peppers ever had 2 albums that were really similar at all from mother's milk to by the way? NO. each album they do is completely different and has its own new style. that's what makes them such a great band.   <br /> <br />NOW FOR THE REVIEW PARTt: I know its long, but i think it's well worth ur time if ur considering buying this album. <br /> <br />I think this is one great live album. The introduction is really funky and sounds great.  \\"Brandy\\" sounds very good and is far better than the origional.   when i first saw teh setlist i was particularly excited to see \\"Get on Top\\" was on it.  and this song does not dissapoint.  My only complaint during this song is that anthony tries to rap too loudly and finds himself almsot shouting during the verses, but noetheless it is a great song. <br /> <br />With great jams after by the way, before right on time, with fleas great bass introduction to around the world, with the half jam. half song after throw away your television that they have been palying all tour, the long jam after give it away (about 9 minutes), the absolutely amazing introduction fro californication, and their flat out amazing live work, this album is definitly one any music fan needs.   <br /> <br />My oppinions on the 2 NEW songs: <br /> <br />\\"Rolling Sly Stone\\" has a bassline that can be described very well by will ferrell.  the bass is :\\"taken for a walk\\" in this song and the guitar during the verses is a relatively similar more in depth version of the guitar during the verses in around the world with the same guitar sound.  The bridge is my one complaint of this song.  It seems to slow the song down a lot.  The song is goin really well and sounds like a great funky tune up until the bridge, but then gets right back into it after the bridge wit ha very short solo from john that gives an important efect on the song nonetheless.  anthony does his sort of \\"rapping\\" thing he made famous in blood sugar sex magik and perfected in \\"aroud the world\\" off californication during the verses and does more \\"singing\\" in the chorus...nothnig too fancy from chad...he jsut does what needs to be done and gives his naturally good effect to the song. <br /> <br />then a very different second new song: <br /> <br />\\"Leverage of Space\\" has a beautiful introduction with john and flea leading into the verse,  and anthony's singing is very very good.  Flea's pre-chrous bass riff's are a perfect way to lead into the more full sound of the chrous which is a step up in intesity and volume from the more mellow verses.  The ending of this song is amazing and features just flat out awesome guitar work with heavy effects by john. this song has softer verses with louder, more intense choruses.  chad uses the crash a lot in the chorus and limits himself to light high-hat use, snare, and bass drum in the verse to keep the verses softer...2 great songs
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I hate pop music but this is by far one of the worst albums ever to go on sale. All I can say is that she is a Christina Aguilera wannabe, a liar, a whore and a freakin' retard. She'll be gone completely within the next three years. <br /> <br />Vocals - No, just horrible, enough said. <br />Backround music - it sounds like movie themed music <br /> <br />Don't by this album, if you like pop then change your style to metal\grunge or even punk is better than this. <br /> <br />I recommend these artists instead: <br />Nirvana <br />Metallica <br />Led Zeppelin <br />Foo Fighters <br />Megadeath <br />even Blink 182
B00006F7IM|5.0|If you are like myself, you are just about sick of sports movies in which the sports action takes a backseat to some smarmy romantic subplot or otherwise irrelevant study in character development.  Okay, that worked in Bull Durham, but for the most part I question why movies like \\"For the Love of the Game\\" and \\"Summer Catch\\" even have to involve baseball or ball players.  Maybe it's just a trick to sucker people into thinking that they're going to see a sports movie.   <br /> <br />Major League is impressive on three levels.  First, the actors are brilliant (even those relegated to smaller roles).  Second, the plot is mainly baseball action, baseball action and more baseball action.  Third, it's hilarious and makes you feel good.  I watch it almost every summer, and for a comedy to lend itself to repeated viewings is a rare thing indeed.   <br /> <br />Plot Synopsis: Rachael Phelps, the ex-showgirl heiress to the Cleveland Indians Baseball franchise finds a loophole in the team's contract with the city saying that the team can leave the city if attendance is low enough.  With her eyes set on moving the team to Miami, she proceeds to put together a team that is sure to lose. Of course, they win! <br /> <br />Simple and sweet, Major League is a well-balanced movie that will entertain both sports enthusiasts as well as people who don't even know the first thing about baseball.  Lots of baseball action, one simple (but well-crafted) romantic subplot, and a cast of hilarious and fun-to-look-at characters make this one of the most engaging comedy movies of all time. <br /> <br />On another note, the screen presence of every actor and actress in this movie is phenomenal.  Sheen, Beringer, Corbin, Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes all in the same movie acting at the top of thier game.  Even those minor characters like Cerrano, Bob Ucker and the old veteran pitcher are acting thier hearts out here.  It's literally an All-Star team of great actors!   <br /> <br />Anyway, I don't think I could justify the movie with an abbreviated review.  If you are a sports fan that like a good comedy - get this movie.      <br /> <br />
B0001ADAVK|2.0|As a former college professor, Seven Sisters graduate, and fan of indie films, I must admit I was not optimistic about this movie.  I was right.<br /><br />Watching the movie, I was constantly reminded of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, a brilliant movie about turn-of-the-century Scottish schoolgirls based on Muriel Spark's novel. Some scenes were eerily similar, such as the \\"girls\\" standing around an art studio, wearing little schoolgirl hats, giggling at a painting. Brodie girls giggled over sex; these women giggled over unfamiliar modernism.<br /><br />Mona Lisa's theme seems familiar: progressive teacher influences students, questions traditional values, develops romantic interests, and fights insensitive administrators  The theme works in secondary school settings, like Brodie and Dead Poets Society,  because teachers can influence children of that age, especially in private schools.<br /><br />In college, especially by senior year, faculty members play a lesser role among students, who learn more from peers.  A movie about college women entering a new age would be better focused on the students themselves.<br /><br />Mona Lisa Smile includes some minor but annoying inconsistencies.  Art 100 would be a freshman course -- but most of the women seem to be seniors.  It's hard to imagine these women would be turned off by (let alone giggle at) contemporary art. Seven Sisters colleges have always been intellectually demanding, yet we never see these students studying or even speaking eloquently.  These girls resemble sorority sisters of Legally Blonde more than students at an elite college.<br /><br />The scene where a married woman returns to campus after a two-week honeymoon seems especially silly. Wellesley students would expect consequences from failing to turn in a paper on time. Professors at top schools rarely count attendance toward a grade and publicly reprimanding a student -- especially in this mean-spirited, almost catty style -- would be inappropriate anywhere.<br /><br />Watson wouldn't teach just one class -- she would have two or three more, each semester.  As an inexperienced teacher out of her element, she'd be overwhelmed.  And after a day of teaching, many professors eagerly seek companionship from other faculty so they can commiserate about their frustrations!<br /><br />Even today, professors still must follow the departmental descriptions of their courses. When a class gets listed as \\"History of art from ancient times to the Impressionists,\\" that's what you teach. You might bring in contemporary works to make comparisons but you can't go off on a tangent of your own.  It's unprofessional and possibly unethical.<br /><br />Watson violates boundaries when she encourages a student to attend law school. Giving her an application -- even helping her complete the application -- seems legitimate. But, like many mentors, Watson became overly invested in her mentee's decisions.  Coming to the student's house with a handful of law school folders - that's way out of line.  So is touching students to make a point.  And I've never heard of a college that gives student files to professors.  Apart from logistics of paperwork in the pre-photocopy era, only advisors and administrators would be likely to have access.<br /><br />The \\"old college days\\" theme would have worked well if a student had been the main character. Mary McCarthy's The Group, though dated, does give us a glimpse into college life in the era when women were free enough to experience some of the world, but not protected by birth control and social approval.  Wendy Wasserstein's Uncommon Women and Others shows student life at a women's college much later and with considerably more realism, humor and style.<br /><br />Alternatively, we could get a realistic movie focused on a female college professor. She'd surely be scared about her own prospects in an alien world.  Gail Godwin's novel The Odd Woman captures some of that feeling -- but it's neither glamorous nor especially fun to watch.<br /><br />In any case,  stories about \\"the way we were\\" rarely seem fresh anymore.  I recommend viewing the real thing. Track down a copy of The Best of Everything, a magnificent fifties period piece showing the working world these women would enter.<br /><br />The ultimate irony: While Watson urges Wellesley women to take their careers seriously, she doesn't seem focused on her own.  Rather than crusading for a vague cause and gaining short-term popularity, she'd have done better to leverage her Wellesley experience for her own success. Then she'd help far more women over the course of her lifetime.f that feeling -- but it's neither glamorous nor especially fun to watch.  <br /> <br />In any case,  stories about \\"the way we were\\" rarely seem fresh anymore.

B00005JN2X|5.0|Collateral is my favorite film of the summer and my second favorite of the year, only to Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Michael Mann, who already gave us the crime classic Heat, delivers another crime classic in the form of Collateral, a film about a taxi driver who is forced to drive a hitman around town as he goes from hit to hit. For the people who were nervous about Tom Cruise being able to pull the role of the villian off, relax: This is the best performance of Cruise's illustrious career. I loved him in Jerry Maguire, thought he ws amazing in Born on The Fourth of July, saw his greatness in Magnolia, and still think Rain Man holds the most underated performance of his career, as well as his second best after this. From the moment we see Cruise walking through LAX Airport, he takes hold of the film and the audience with his gripping intensity, his sarcastic quips, scariness and mean streak. This is one of the best movie villians of all time, right there with Denzel in Training Day and Hopkins as Hannibal. He pulls off that likability factor with the audience, even as he does many horrendous things. In fact, his character is as charming in some scenes as a Jerry Maguire. The movie is worth a look for his performance alone. <br /> <br />However, Jamie Foxx is just as good as the good natured cab driver who Cruise forces into this predicament. It is Foxx's best  performance as well, as he also takes hold of the audience as the protagonist, a cab driver too scared to chase his dreams, but still someone who cares and takes pride in his work, even if nobody notices him or respects him. He has his own set of morals and is a very nice character, and it was great to see him change as the film went along and he had to adapt to different scenarios.  <br /> <br />The resr of the cast did their job beautifully as well, especially standouts Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Irma P. Hall. The score was briliiant, as were the song selections. The editing was great,and the script by Stuart Beattie was top notch. Michael Mann does what might be his best work as a director, outside of The Insider, as he shot the film with a digital camera, that helps make the city of LA an integral character in the film. The movie is a little over two hours, but it is so fast paced you don't notice and you don't want it to end. The ending. much like Training Day, takes away from the film a bit, as it seems a little different from the rest of the film, but that is a minor complaint that the movie manages to overcome because of the greatness the movie achieves before that. I love this movie and will be hardpressed to find too many more movies that will be better than this one.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a great film. Tarantion dazzled us with action and gore in the first one, and he dazzles us with conversations and intense moments in this one. David Carradine gives the best performance of his career, and captivates the audience as Bill. Uma Thurman is a wonder once again as the bride, and she does even better as the film gets more emotional. the fight scenes are less prevalent, but just just as effective and Tarantino lets all his actors shine with this great script. Michael Madsen is wonderful in this film, and he probably should only work for Tarantino the rest of his career. A brilliantly directed and acted film that rises to the occasion.
B0000255CL|5.0|This is not my first Immortal release, nor shall it be my last, but when I first heard At the Heart of Winter, I could not believe how majestic and cold the melodies were! They were simply fantastic! The musicianship is absolutely awesome, Horgh is a great drummer and his work is very good on this album, although I don't think it's the greatest drumming I've ever heard on an Immortal cd. Abbath's vocals are cold as usual, they don't really change much, though, the riffs on this album are simply FANTASTIC! The technicality presented here is among the finest guitar work I have ever heard in Black Metal, every riff is cold and beautifully melodic, where some BM riffs are simple and utterly pointless, without naming names. The guitar fills are simply fantastic, Abbath does a great job replacing Demonaz as lead guitarist, who left due to Tendonitis in his arms. I jsut can't stop saying it.... the riffs are so fast, so cold, so melodic, so perfect and so technical..... This cd really inspires me when writing music. <br />The bass mainly just follows the guitar or drums so there's not much to comment on there. <br /> <br />Every song is simply fantastic, my favourite being Withstand the Fall of Time, only by a hair, the rest are simply amazing anyway. The only moment that this cd dropped off are in Tradgedies Blow at Sunset, which I believed went too long. <br />Overall, one of the greatest cds I have ever heard, I would recommend this to anyone who like Melodic Death Metal (not saying it is, I'm saying you'd like it!) or Black Metal. <br /> <br />P.S, This is not Death Metal, they are not DM masters as it says in the Product Description! Do not be fooled! :)
B0000028UK|5.0|After the huge success of their classic debut, Ten, Pearl Jam fire back with another excellent collection of songs.  This is easily their rawest and most in your face album of theirs, but at the same time, they begin to find their own sound and they show glimpses of what's to come on their later albums.  The first 2 songs, Go and Animal, take the sound that was originated on Ten, speed it up and throw in some more anger.  Great songs with great lyrics.  Blood and Leash also follow the same formula, creating 2 of their most aggressive songs ever written.  Daughter shows them experimenting with acoustic guitars for the first time and it works well.  Overall, I'd say it's an overrated song, but still very good and much better live.  Elderly Woman takes the acoustic guitar and makes great use of it, creating one of their best songs to date.  Dissident is a good rocker, but a bit more mellow than what you'd expect from them, Glorified G is a cool song about gun control which contains a very interesting guitar riff, Rats is a great underrated song with very interesting lyrics comparing humans to rats, and Rearviewmirror (commonly referred to as RVM) is my 2nd favorite Pearl Jam song of all time.  It is a melodic rocker with a great chorus and the most intense ending to any song!  Check out some live versions for some insanely cool stuff.  W.M.A. is another underrated song.  It was the most unique thing they had done up until that point in their career and it sounds like it would have been better placed on No Code with the somewhat tribal drumming and all.  The closing song, Indifference, continues with the trend of closing with slower, more beautiful songs.  Brilliant lyrics, beautiful melody, and one of their best songs to date, closing out one of Pearl Jam's all time best albums.  Go buy it.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Let me start by saying I LOVE KILL BILL 1.  That being said my expectations for this movie were sky high.  I gave 3 stars for simple fact that I should be grading on a curve because it is probably not that bad,  I had too high expectations.  The action in this movie was very dull to me and she didnt have enough interaction with Bill, Elle, and Buddy (the three remaining death squad members.)  I love the story, but it was slow and wasnt Tarrentino esqu to me.  I hear there will be a third volume involving Vernita Green's daughter so I will look forward to that but as for this movie if you are a fan of the series, watch it for conclusion but, I suggest going in with lower expectations
B000002BFZ|5.0|As if Vitalogy wasn't weird enough, Pearl Jam fade even more out of the limelight with the release of No Code - an extremely diverse collection of experimental songs.  Every song is so different from each other that I won't be able to do it justice unless I do a track by track review (and even THAT won't do it justice; it needs to be heard to be understood).  So here goes: <br /> <br />1.  Sometimes - the quirkiest song they ever wrote (until Can't Keep from Riot Act came out).  It's a very subtle, and honest song.  A nice opener that definitely sets the tone for the rest of the album. <br /> <br />2.  Hail, Hail - a typical Pearl Jam rocker.  Great guitar riff and punishing vocals.  They show their punk influences in this song. <br /> <br />3.  Who You Are - the first single from the album.  People didn't know what happened to the REAL Pearl Jam when this song came out.  It's so different from anything they've ever done.  Great tribal drumming and very melodic vocals provide for one of their most interesting songs ever.  Great song. <br /> <br />4.  In My Tree - similar drumming as the previous song, another tribal sound.  One of my favorite songs from the album, and great live as well (afterall, they are the best live band around). <br /> <br />5.  Smile - a very upbeat, happy sounding song.  It contains excellent use of harmonica.  The chorus is beautiful and melodic.  Another great song. <br /> <br />6.  Off He Goes - most beautiful song on the cd (and also the longest, clocking in at just over 6 minutes).  This is basically a slow acoustic song with brilliant lyrics and beautiful vocals.  Probably my favorite song from this album. <br /> <br />7.  Habit - another punky song, don't really like this one.  The vocals are annoying. <br /> <br />8.  Red Mosquito - Pearl Jam's first of several bluesy rockers scattered throughout their next few albums (well, Smile is pretty bluesy too).  Great guitar work introduces the song and McCready is all over the rest of the song.  One of their best. <br /> <br />9.  Lukin - a minute long.  Hilarious punk song with hilarious vocals.  Can't really describe it, you just need to hear it.  Not really a song, but I love listening to it. <br /> <br />10.  Present Tense - definitely top 3 songs on this album.  Starts off slow and constantly builds.  Great lyrics, and like usual, great vocals.  Very nice guitar too. <br /> <br />11.  Mankind - The mic is given to guitarist Stone Gossard for this song.  It shows why he isn't the lead singer, although I do enjoy it.  A blatant pop song with very catchy vocals.  An entertaining listen to say the least. <br /> <br />12.  I'm Open - very different sounding \\"song\\".  It's mostly spoken word with a nice, melodic \\"chorus\\".  A very relaxing track with interesting lyrics. <br /> <br />13.  Around The Bend - I don't love this song, but it did get much better after hearing the Live At Benaroya Hall version.  Another nice, relaxing song that has a tropical feel to it.  A little boring maybe, but pretty good. <br /> <br />Sorry if this review became overlong and tedious, but to fully understand how diverse this album really is, I figured it would help by reviewing each track.  But like I already said, you won't really be able to tell until you hear it for yourself.  So do yourselves a favor and pick up this brilliant album.
B000002NIW|5.0|This album just flat out ROCKS! Nothing new to say from the other great reviews by great fans. But i keep reading how people hate getting to the awsome hidden track (DAMONE). So heres a big time saving TIP for those who dont know!! (Portable CD player only) <br />1. Set the Continuing function on (the U symbol)  <br />2. From beginning of track 1 (my own summer) hold the button to rewind. (CD player should go all the way to the end from Damone so keep rewinding till the beginning. (time around 32:35) <br />3. Start playing and enjoy this awsome hard song.
B000002BYD|5.0|After two very experimental albums, Pearl Jam return to more of a straight up rock sound.  This is one of my favorite albums of theirs (yes, I think I say that about all their albums) and also, one of their most normal.  It opens up with a punk song, Brain Of J., which could have easily been found on Vitalogy, right alongside Spin The Black Circle.  One of my favorites.  Faithful follows and it's an amazing song.  A weird sounding riff opens up the song, but it turns into a great rocker.  No Way is a good, bluesy rocker.  Given To Fly is one of their all time best songs.  This song is so exciting, the way the verses build from low to loud, and the chorus is great.  Amazing guitar in this song as well.  Wishlist is slightly boring, better live.  Pilate is a good song, starts off slow and builds into an angry chorus.  Do The Evolution is a chaotic punk song.  Very interesting lyrics, crazy vocals, awesome guitar lines.  One of their best live songs.  Untitled (red dot) isn't really a song.  The Untitled they play live is a hundred times better.  But the next song, MFC, is one of the best on the album.  A two and a half minute rocker about a car.  Cool stuff.  Low Light is one of the most beautiful songs they ever wrote.  Great vocal performance and nice guitar.  I was fortunate enough to see a rare performance of this live at MSG (there is a bootleg AND a DVD of this show available in stores).  In Hiding is another one of the best songs on the album.  Upbeat song with a phenomenal chorus.  Push Me Pull Me is not really a song, skip it.  All Those Yesterdays closes out the album, a great Beatles-esque song.  Nice melodies, and the Beatles influence shines through.  Great ending to a great album.
B000002H33|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest albums of all time. its my favorite album i ever bought which was like 5 months ago. i listen to it everyday and i never get sick of it. heres my ratings on the songs: <br /> <br />Battery: 10/10 holy crap this song kicks ass. its so fast paced and just a headbanger that me and my friends play everywhere... kinda like a dance song for metalheads <br /> <br />Master of Puppets: 10/10 another awesome song kinda long which annoys me sometimes but still great lyrics and even greater guitars <br /> <br />The Thing That Should Not Be: 9/10 kinda slow and guitars arent all that great but still a cool song <br /> <br />Sanitarium: 10/10 second best song on album (next to Battery/Master of Puppets, theyre both tied at best) great lyrics, great guitar, great everything <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes: 10/10 another long but cool song about a soldier, great lyrics and cool solos <br /> <br />Leper Messiah: 8/10 I liked this song at first but after listening to it several times i realized it wasnt all that great, but still good compared to alot of other music out there today <br /> <br />Orion- ? eh, i dont listen to instrumentals, you can judge for yourself how good it is <br /> <br />Damage, Inc. 10/10 holy sh*t i was blown away by this song. this is the epitome of thrash metal. lyrics are kinda stupid but the guitars and drums are so fast you have to love it <br /> <br /> <br />to sum it up, this album is flawless from beginning to end, must be in the collection of any rock fan.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Easily their most underrated album of all time.  Sure, it contains some of their most mellow songs (Nothing As It Seems, Thin Air, Of The Girl, Sleight Of Hand) and maybe some of their least memorable (Evacuation and Rival), but it also contains some of their best songs.  Binaural gets off to a rocking start with the first 3 songs clocking in at a little over 7 minutes.  Breakerfall and God's Dice are killer songs, while Evacuation annoys the heck out of me.  But the next 4 songs rank up there with some of their best.  Light Years is a great song that single handedly got me into discovering the rest of Pearl Jam's catalogue past Vitalogy.  Nothing As It Seems is a brilliant, haunting ballad with great guitar work.  Best song on the album.  Thin Air is a pretty acoustic song and Insignificance is an all out rocker with a great chorus and great guitar riffs.  The album slows down with Of The Girl.  Never cared for this song until I heard it live.  Much better live (very funky) but still good on the album, although it may be slightly boring.  Grievance is a political anthem and another great rocker.  Again, great live song.  Rival is bluesy in the vain of Red Mosquito, but not nearly as good.  Good lyrics, but one of the worst songs on the album.  Sleight Of Hand is a brilliant song with great atmospheric music.  Soon Forget is just Eddie and his ukulele and contains some of the best lyrics he ever wrote.  Parting Ways is a mini-epic to close out the album.  It's a great song that contains some orchestration.  Don't listen to people who bash this album.  Give it a try and judge it for yourself.  It may not be their best, but it's still excellent, and definitely worth adding to your collection
B00005JKCH|5.0|Now this is a comic book movie!After seeing the Superman and Batman series fail(Even though the new Bat-Film is coming out next year)it's good to know we're always have Spidey.I thought this movie was great.It has everything:great acting(with amazing performances by Tobey Maguire(Peter/Spidey)and Wilem Dafoe(Norman/Green Goblin)a great plot,some great action scenes,and it's really true to the characters of the comics.Overall,a terrific film and I recommend it.And if you like this one,go see the second one!!!! It's even better
B0000027RL|5.0|I don't know what I can possibly say about this album that hasn't already been said in the hundreds of other reviews, but this truly is a classic album that lives up to all the hype surrounding it.  Pearl Jam are my favorite band of all time and I think every album they released is amazing in their own way.  But Ten gives you a feeling that none of their other albums give you.  With heavy, fast rockers such as Once, Even Flow, Why Go, Deep, and Porch; classic songs that EVERYBODY knows like Alive and Jeremy; and slower, more beautiful songs like Garden, Release, Oceans, and Black (my favorite song of all time), you can't help but smile the entire way through.  Every track is great, and even though there isn't as much diversity on this album as oh, let's say No Code, there are plenty of different moods captured on here to leave you wanting more at the end.  This album catapulted a new era of rock music, and rightfully so.  From the opening fury of Once to the beautiful, epic finale Release, you will not be bored for a second.  This cd came out 13 years ago and it sounds just as fresh now as it did then.  I'd be shocked if you don't already own this classic album, but if you don't, GET IT NOW!
1878424319|5.0|I picked up this book in the airport to fly off to a business trip which I did not want to go to.  It was absolutely an enlightening experience reading this book and have given me a little joy each day out of my boring business trip.  As required by work, my life revolves traveling and lately I have experienced some great challenges in life.   <br /> <br />I have been a person that has adopted many emotional garbages that are \\"programmed\\" in my mind I do not even know about (the old agreements).  For years, I allowed the parasites absorb my positive energy and I allowed the Judge and the victim mentality to suck my energy away.  This book, along with some others I have read so far, helped me in my journey of the spiritual growth.  This book, especially, taught me how precious life is and how much I need to deeply appreciate all the things I have in life.  I have never found the need to appreciate this much about life till I finished this book.  The book also taught me how to love, how to forgive and how to be gentle with myself and others.   <br /> <br />Again, as I wrote in other reviews, one single book is not going to lead you to the road of happiness or to live life with contentment.  The key is, you have to make the determination to change, to know what needs to be changed and to find inner peace.  It requires an open-minded heart, inner strength and determination to break your old agreements and to adopt the new agreements.  Challenges in life is going to tempt each one of us to slip back to the old way.  However, may all of us find that inner strength to love, and to create a heaven on earth.  May we find the strength to keep the new agreements to be the better self.
B00006M183|5.0|This is perhaps their most straight up rock cd with some oddly interesting songs spread out.  It opens with a very quirky song Can't Keep.  Decent song, not one of my favorites, but interesting to say the least.  It flows nicely into Save You, an all out punk song that reminds me a lot of Spin The Black Circle.  I adore this song, it rocks so hard.  Love Boat Captain is my favorite song on the album.  Great, emotional lyrics and awesome music (compliments to Boom Gasper, who plays keyboards on the album).  Next up are 3 straight up rockers, Cropduster, Ghost, and I Am Mine.  All very good songs, but nothing too original.  Thumbing My Way is an all acoustic song.  Slightly boring, but great lyrics and great vocals.  You Are is one of the most interesting songs they ever wrote.  The guitar riff is bluesy and very Hendrix-esque.  A great overall song and musically one of the most different songs for them.  Get Right and Green Disease are two more rockers, pretty punky too.  Again, great songs but nothing too new and original.  Help, Help is up next and I think that might be the worst song Pearl Jam ever wrote.  It's just...terrible.  I can't explain why I hate it so much, so I'll just stop talking about it.  Bushleaguer is another low point on the album.  Insanely political song (just take a look at the title!) that bashes Bush.  Great guitar intro leads into spoken word verses and a good chorus.  Could have been much better, but kind of a letdown.  1/2 Full is the \\"Red Mosquito\\" of the album.  Very similar, bluesy song with great guitar work by McCready.  Arc is not really a song, just a vocal solo (I guess you can call it that) by Vedder.  It's a nice track that flows perfectly into the excellent closer, All Or None.  Great song which features very tastey guitar work by McCready and one of Vedder's best vocal performances of all time.  What's amazing about Pearl Jam is that this might be my least favorite album by them, yet it's still easily a 5-star album.  Check out their whole catalogue, it's all great stuff.  Every album is different, and incredible in their own way.  They never write the same album twice, and that is why they are my favorite band of all time.
0780619951|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  I thought the time was right for a remake, given the breakthroughs in genetic science, and I thought Brando and Kilmer would be ideal.<br /><br />But this is a mess.<br /><br />I saw it in the theatres and I even went as far as buy the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD.  But it's still a mess.<br /><br />The original director/screenwriter has a website and he explains how the entire movie ran off track.  He was fired and then snuck onto the set as an extra (to meet Brando!).  I realize his rants might read as sour grapes, but too much of it makes sense.<br /><br />Original lead Rob Morrow (of NORTHERN EXPOSURE) quickly escaped.  The expressions of replacement Thewlis almost looked like special makeup effects.  Kilmer was completely out of control, Brando was bored and went into mad improvisations, hired-hand director Frankenheimer arrives to rewrite scenes daily.  Yikes.<br /><br />But I thought Fairuza Balk was beautiful.  Maybe with Morrow, I could see a relationship working with her character and the lead--but not as it plays.<br /><br />Too bad.  The material deserved better.
B000002AZ8|5.0|After two hugely successful albums, one would expect Pearl Jam to continue the trend of making music accessible to everyone so more people can discover their brilliant music and enjoy what they have to offer.  But instead of reaching towards more fame, they go the opposite route and make one of their least commercial albums to date (with the exception of Betterman and Corduroy).  Opening up with the amazing Last Exit, you already know you are in for a very different sort of ride.  Spin The Black Circle is a blatant punk song, much in the vain of Go or Animal from Vs.  This is probably the only song ever written as a tribute to vinyl.  Not For You is another different kind of rock song.  Its slow verses build up the tension for an explosive chorus and then leads into a very cool synth-sounding instrumental break.  Tremor Christ is one of the oddest, most cacophanous songs they ever wrote.  But believe me when I say, it works very well in this case.  The song is centered around a simple guitar riff that pounds into your head and will haunt you for days.  Nothingman is up next, and is one of my top 3 favorite Pearl Jam songs.  It is insanely beautiful and almost makes me cry everytime I hear it.  Whipping is another punky song with a cool intro.  Corduroy is an obvious radio hit, but it's still a great song, you all know this one.  Satan's Bed is another crazy, weird, interesting song.  Don't have much to say about it, not one of my favorites, but definitely a good song.  Betterman, what's there to say about it?  Everyone knows it, overplayed, but still great.  The album closes out with Immortality (well, not really, I'll get to that in a second...).  Probably the 2nd best song on the album, after Nothingman.  Pearl Jam excel most at writing slow, beautiful songs.  This song has great lyrics and a great guitar solo.  Check out the Live At Benaroya Hall version of this song for a mind blowing acoustic solo. <br /> <br />The only thing wrong with this cd are the 4 attempts of blatant experimentation, which seem like they were thrown on here just to make the cd even weirder than it has to be.  Pry, To is one minute of Eddie screaming \\"P-R-I-V-A-C-Y is priceless to me\\" a few times.  Bugs is hilarious, but will never be listened to more than 1 or 2 times.  It's Eddie ranting about annoying bugs with the accompaniment of an accordian for several minutes.  Aye Davanita isn't too bad, it's a funky instrumental, but I always seem to skip it.  The actual closer to the album is perhaps the strangest, scariest thing I have ever heard.  Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me is a girl talking about getting abused with the most chilling music played in the background.  I'm honestly too frightened to ever listen to this song again! <br /> <br />This is probably Pearl Jam's strangest album to date while their next album, No Code will prove to be their most diverse album to date.  Don't listen to people who say \\"Pearl Jam's last good album was Vitalogy\\".  Those people are fools and probably never gave them a solid chance.  Change isn't a bad thing folks.  And hey, their first 3 albums are all different from each other as well.  So please, continue your Pearl Jam journey after Vitalogy.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I had to wait until this one came to video because it did not come to the theater in my town. I was anxious to see it after hearing all the good buzz surrounding it. I was not disappointed. This movie is raw human emotion..it holds nothing back. I was captivated by the Bolger sisters and their absolutely heartbreaking performances. Samantha Morton rightfully deserved her Oscar nomination, and had it not been for Charlize Theron's mesmerizing portrayal of Aileen Wuornos in Monster, she would've won. We see into each character's struggles to make it in America, and how the two girls, despite their young ages, are the glue that keeps everything together and keep hope alive. Djimon Hounsou also gives a great supporting performance as a disease stricken neighbor the girls grow to love and whom, in the end, becomes an angel of sorts for the family. I could not keep my eyes off the screen and I truly felt for this family and everything they endured. Kudos to everyone involved in this film. Truly a work of art.
B000002H33|1.0|I never liked this album. It was garbage in my opinion. You guys can bash me all you want, but i dont care, THIS ALBUM SUCKED.
038551123X|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the serial killer/thriller genre but this one transcends the usual formulas..and by a long shot. Imagine, if you can, rooting for a guy who is a serial killer . To top it off, he's got the perfect cover, working as a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police department. Things are going well until another, equally competent, serial killer appears in Miami, threatening to throw Dexter off his game.<br /><br /> I'm amazed at how well Jeff Lindsay portrays Dexter, a guy who sees himself as emotionless, but comes across as an almost soulful guy. He's witty, generally polite, good-looking..the perfect guy, except for one obvious character flaw. Add suspense and some unpredictable twists to the tale and you've got a winner. This could have been a gimmicky book but Lindsay doesn't take the easy road and readers who stick with this one will be in for a special experience.<br /><br />Note to Author: Give me a heads up when your next one comes out.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|You either get Marillion or you don't.  Those that don't just can't seem to figure out why there are some out there that would practically sell their soul for this band. This album is definately worth that.  I purchased the Deluxe 2CD campaign edition back in 2003.  First off, the packaging is simply stunning.  Hard cover book and some 120 pages of artwork and lyrics.  Then there is the music.  This is by far the band's best album since \\"Brave\\"  It takes the slick production of \\"Anoraknophobia\\" and just goes all out....with out the fear (seemingly, this time) of being progressive.   <br />     \\"The Invisible Man\\" is a haunting 13 minute marvel full of emotion and staggering guitar solos.  There is the untouchable \\"Ocean Cloud\\" about a man that, after years of ridicule, leaves life behind for the sea. You will see ghosts.  A few radio friendly \\"Genie\\", \\"You're Gone\\" (think an up beat \\"21st Century\\") and \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\" All interspersed with the Marbles - Parts I - IV throught the album.   <br />     You either get them or you don't....I do.  And it is brilliant.
B00012FXAE|4.0|There are few sequels that are as good or even better than the first movie, and \\"Aliens\\" is a great sequel. This film has more action scenes than the original movie, and this time there are hundreds of monsters waiting for Ripley, our favorite movie heroine. Once again she has to battle against the space creatures and an ambitious Company, which is ready to sacrifice human lives in order to get a powerful weapon (the monsters).  <br /> <br />But this time, Ripley must save her own skin, and she also has to play the role of a mother for the little Newt, a charming little girl that Ripley found on a devastated colony. \\"Aliens\\" is the kind of film that you can watch over and over again and you will always discover something new. If you liked the first \\"Alien\\" movie, then the sequel \\"Aliens\\" is a must-see thriller. <br /> <br />This Collector's Edition is stunning, the additional material is excellent, you can sit for hours watching the bonus disc. There are special features for almost every area in \\"Aliens\\": music, visual effects, casting, the making of the creatures, interviews, picture galleries, well, it's a lot of worthy material. <br /> <br />Of course the highlight of this special edition is James Cameron's audio commentary, and two versions of \\"Aliens\\", the theatrical release, and the director's cut, which adds a lot of scenes and explains some situations. I think that this is the kind of DVD that must be done with every movie that has a \\"Director's Cut\\", the studios should include both the original and the new cut, because that way no one would feel frustrated. You can compare both versions and decide which one is better.  <br /> <br />Personally, I'm going to alternate both versions when I see \\"Aliens\\", although the original version has a faster pace. But on the other hand, the new version adds more scenes. Anyway, if you like this movie, this Collector's edition is a must-own.
0553382179|5.0|I have been following the FlyLady systems for about 2 years now and I can't believe the difference it has made in my life!  Now I truly believe that I can \\"do anything for 15 minutes\\".  I had no idea that having a clean home, happy, healthy kids, all starting with taking care of myself first!  This book is amazing.  Just take a look at her website at flylady.net and check it out for yourself.  She is an inspiration to SHE's everywhere!
B0000024K1|5.0|Back in 1988, I heard this when I was 11 years old, a little white kid growing up in the suburbs. Chuck D completely discredited everything I'd been raised to believe in and Terminator X (with help from the Bomb Squad) radically altered my idea of how music was made and what purpose it really served in our society. I am a for-real music fanatic and the vast majority of all music I've listened to and respected since 1988 can all be traced back to THIS album. I've heard and loved a whole damn lot of music in my life and I can say with complete confidence that this is one of the most important musical recordings of the 20th Century. No joke. Five stars is actually an insult--this music is priceless.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I don't know how many times I have watched this movie, I still watch it every chance I get. Now that it is (finally) out on DVD, I am ordering it so that I can watch it whenever I need to. I love all of the other Kurasawa movies (I consider Seven Samurai to be the greatest movie ever made) but this one is my personal favorite. It is beautiful and fulfilling, a rare work of art.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Finally, Polaski's masterpiece gets a decent DVD release (the only previous one, from Brazil, suffered from horrendous quality), with a good transfer but, alas, practically no extras (primarily a short documentary, \\"Vampires 101\\"). Based on the information released so far, I only have two complaints - firstly, the imbecilic cover (this awful doodle looks like \\"Le Petit Nicolas\\" rather than \\"Fearless Vampire Killers\\"), and secondly, the apparent lack of the maligned animated introduction, made for the butchered cinematic release in USA. Yes, the introduction was horrible, but it should have been included as a bizarre curiosity (its lack is even more inexplicable considering that the Brazilian DVD *had* it as a bonus feature). Still, even if this disc is very poor in extra features, it should at least look nicely, if the Warners' promise of a restored transfer is true.
B00005JNEI|5.0|That's what dubya was thinking during those seven minutes in that Florida school room.<br /><br />Even though I knew what a weasel dubya was before I saw F911, I was still very disturbed after viewing the movie. I recommend this movies to all voters. Watch this movie before you cast your vote on November 2.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Having grown up with Britney, I've always been a fan. Of her four albums, however, this is the best! Primarily a dance record, \\"Everytime,\\" \\"Touch of My Hand,\\" and \\"Shadow\\" provide a break with melodic grooves. Perfect for starting a night out on the town, or a day shopping, In The Zone is a must have for any Britney fan, or someone looking for some great upbeat tunes. <br /> <br />With contributions from R.Kelly, the Yin Yang Twins, and Madonna - this album offers a full range of styles. <br /> <br />
B00005QDW5|3.0|Opinions about the discs: <br /> <br />CD I <br /> <br />1. Astronomy Domine - Overrated, but still the best early song (along with 'Careful With That Axe, Eugene' which is unfortuneately not included here). 3/5 <br />2. See Emily Play - A psyhedelic garbage. Infantilism can attack you early. I like Cinderella better. Very weak - if I compare this to songs like Time or Money. Good for a laugh. 1/5 <br />3.+4. Happiest Days/Another Brick... - A very good song, though I've heard it a million times.  4.5/5 <br />5. Echoes - Overrated, but I can listen to it often. Nice singing, and playing. 4/5 <br />6. Hey You - One of the better songs from 'The Wall'. 5/5 <br />7. Marooned - A beatiful, soft but too short instrumental. Wright & Gilmour shines here, too. 4/5 <br />8. The Great Gig In The Sky - Wright's piano & organ along with some exalted singing by Clare Torry. 4.5/5 <br />9. Set The Controls - Also an overrated 'gem'. Sorry, I just can't get excited. 3.5/5 <br />10. Money - A classic. 5/5 <br />11. Keep Talking - Seems like they've lost something after Rogers exit. No hope for the old professionalism and brightness <br />2.5/5 <br />12. Sheep - Probably my favorite song from 'Animals'. Great piano intro by Wright, cool riffs, and a gorgeous ending. 5/5 <br />13. Sorrow - This one also bores me to hell. Sorry. 2/5 <br /> <br />CD II <br /> <br />1. Crazy Diamond - An absolutely splendid opus. It's edited altough, but I don't care. 5/5 <br />2. Time - Just like Money, this is unquestionably a classic. 5/5 <br />3. The Fletcher Memorial Home - Skip this. Otherwise you need a pocket of handkerchieves, and a box of stomachic. For all that, Gilmour's solo is enjoyable. 1.5/5 <br />4. Comfortably Numb - Soulful refrain, and very touching solos from Gilmour. You need to hear this!4.5/5 <br />5. When The Tigers Broke Free - They've messed up this cd again. Totally boring, really not the best. For sure. I don't need good lyrics if the music is dull. You don't need this one.1.5/5 <br />6. One Of These Days - An overrated jam, though it's good. Phrase by Nick Mason. 3.5/5 <br />7. Us And Them - One of the best songs from the album called 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. 5/5 <br />8. Learning To Fly - Good if you want to hear them somewhat more commercial. I don't think so that this should be the greatest line-up in Pink Floyd's history. A 'highlight' from the '87 album.  3/5 <br />9. Arnold Layne - An amateurish single again. Catchy psyhedelic light-weight pop ditty. 1/5 <br />10. Wish You Were Here - One of the most whirling and enthralling hit Pink Floyd has ever made. <br />Great stuff. 5/5 <br />11. Jugband Blues - A dry, muzzy, and laughable descant. 2/5 <br />12. High Hopes - One of the better things from the '94 album. Solid, but still not the old Floyd sound. 3/5 <br />13. Bike - This must be a joke. Check out Hockey-Pockey instead. Guaranteed laughing and endless smiles. Some very weird quacks at the end. I must admit it's funny. Also funny: some think this is a landmark song by Syd. 2/5 <br /> <br />I hope you liked my review, and appriciated my thoughts. Thank you.
B000002BE9|5.0|i can remember first falling in love with this cd. it was about 4 months after the album came out she was on the cover of the daily news in los angeles and she was doing a show that night '96. i read the review of her album and just went out and bought it, wow just an amazing album i couldn't get over it for months. and years later i still go back and play this cd and just hearing her voice, heartache, longing for love, obsession it's just wonderful music on that album. i gotta say that never is a promise is my favorite from tidal.
B00007E8V4|5.0|What is with you people not liking this. It is one of the best cd's ever. It is not bad at all. Many people think this cd is SOAD's best and some think it's there worst. I think it's as good as Toxicity but worse then there first album. The overall rating for this cd is 4.5 out of 5 stars so you know it's going to be good. I love the introduction to all the songs as I do to every other SOAD song. I don't like how they left us on this cd with soft, lighter songs because it made me believe it was the end for them, but it's not. There have been rumours of a new SOAD cd coming out in late 2004. If you can find one of the cd's that has a picture from one of the four members drawn on it, buy that. Try to get at least one. This cd is still worth buying because the songs are played out well. I like how the guitar and the drums sound. The vocals are always great. It is just one great cd that will have you listening to it for years. <br /> <br />SONG RATINGS: <br />1.Chic n Stu-(2:23)-10/10 <br />2.Innervision-(2:33)-10/10 <br />3.Bubbles-(1:56)-9/10 <br />4.Boom!-(2:14)-10/10 <br />5.Nuguns-(2:30)-8/10 <br />6.A.D.D.-(3:17)-10/10 <br />7.Mr.Jack-(4:09)-9/10 <br />8.I-E-A-I-A-I-O-(3:08)-10/10 <br />9.36-(:46)-9/10 <br />10.Pictures-(2:06)-10/10 <br />11.Highway Song-(3:13)-10/10 <br />12.F*** the System-(2:12)-10/10 <br />13.Ego Brain-(3:21)-10/10 <br />14.Thetawaves-(2:36)-10/10 <br />15.Roulette-(3:21)-10/10 <br />16.Streamline-(3:37)-9/10
B00002MZ4W|5.0|this album is so much different from her debut and it should have gotten more people to listen, it was beautifully written and just a wonderful album all around it's still fiona apple but just much more mature but yet more delicate. i just love every song on this album. i have no favorite one, not like i did with tidal. with this one every thing just falls into place. can't wait for what's next.
B0000033OT|5.0|I just love this album. I have so much respect for Mr. Hathaway. It's too bad that he was taken from us too soon. Everything is Everything is an album that I listen to for so many reasons. I listen to it at the office when I need inspiration (Thank You Master For My Soul, To Be Young, Gifted &amp; Black), when I reflect on how fortunate I am to live in a world of opportunity when others aren't (The Ghetto, Trying Times) and when I realize the true power of love (I Believe to My Soul, Je Vous Aime Beacoup).<br />Overall, this album is timeless and depicts true soul music. All of the songs carry powerful messages and there is no one better suited to convey these messages than Mr. Donny himself. God Rest His Soul...
B0002HTZJI|4.0|First of all,I consider the Red Hot Chili Peppers as one of the most talented and inspired musicians today.I have heard to a respectable quantity of their musical contribution from albums to B-sides,live performances,etc. <br />Being an 'old pepper's style' fan I must admit that the setlist of this album is a bit disappointing for me but I didn't expect something else cause the band's avoiding tension of playing some of their old stuff (before 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik')is well-known and I respect that.Saying that I'm an old fan,I mean that I was more into the music,the authenticity and the ambition of a band which loved(and loves I think-take for example their Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love' cover) soul/funk/punk/rock music.In the time period from their beggining until the release of 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' in 1991,I was really admiring their effort and musical style.Afterwards,the Frusciante re-arrival somewhat changed their musical orientation.Songs of this orientation are the majority in this album. <br />The 'Peppers' are all wonderful musicians,every single one of them,their conception over music is remarkable for me-as they approach mine personal likes and perception-and they can experiment with musical forms brilliantly.I still respect and love their work and their musical revolution and direction. <br />The show overall is very good and entertaining and most importantly with respect to their audience.Although,I think that this album came out because of their desire to release a 'live' album in order to satisfy a public demand rather than to offer something new to their fans.Personally,I liked more their last year live show at Slane Castle,Ireland and I suggest trying to get the also-titled DVD. <br />I give 4 stars because of my appreciation to the 'Peppers'. <br /> <br />I also apologise for my English...thank you for reading. <br />
078681859X|5.0|This is an excellent read, and although lately there seem to be so many Potter spin-off's...this isn't. It is about a boy, Nathaniel, who is a magician's apprentice...and a djinni named Bartimaeus. Their story deals with different planes of the astral world, and it is fascinating to learn about all the different creatures that inhibit their world..and others. I really like this book. Unlike the Artemis Fowl books which I can read in a day, this one has been a week's read.  I love it when a book can hold your attention for that amount of time. Anyway, it's intriguing and everyone should get a copy & read it. It's really great. Can't wait for the next book in the series. <br /> <br />
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest adventure/sci-fi films of all time.  It was very smart of the makers to cast not \\"Huge Stars, but great actors\\".  The acting is great, and the musical score is great. <br />I noticed in someone else's review that they commented that the movie is totally unrealistic because guns couldn't penetrate a dinosaur's skin.  That could be true, but I don't see how you could possibly know that, considering that dinosaur skin isn't dug up with their bones.  The skin has decomposed and is long gone, so I don't see how you could possibly know the thickness of their skin. <br />Some think that this movie was only successful because of the great special effects, but I think you are way wrong.  The film does have great effects, and a very interesting story as well.  Also, one thing that I like about this film is that they only used the CGI dinosaurs when they needed to.  There are many scenes that use robotic dinosaurs during close-ups, and the CGI dinosaurs are mostly used when they need to show the creatures from head-to-toe, so the movie makers weren't as obsessed with the Computer effects as they are today. <br />At first glance, this DVD may seem to have a small selection of bonus features, but don't be fooled.  In amazon's description, one feature is a \\"documentary\\".  But this is one of the greatest in-depth movie documentaries that I've seen.  It's not just ten minutes of cast and crew mentioning a few things about the movie, it goes into great detail about how the movie was made, how they aquired sounds and did the effects.  You will not be disapointed.
6304458223|5.0|Anyone that enjoys adventure movies with animals like \\"Alaska\\" or \\"The Amazing Panda Adventure\\" should love this movie. I would just like to thank all those responsible for making the movie. It is a true joy to watch family movies like this at this time when families seem to be struggling to get along let alone work at a common goal. If Walt Disney were still alive he would have loved this movie. Walt produced a number of animal movies in the Sixties that are fun to watch even today. Inspired by a man that actually helped geese migrate you will not be disappointed in this story.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels as the Father and Anna Paquin as the daughter use Ultralight planes to escort geese on the right migration path. I can see that this movie will be a classic like the other great animal movies. If you enjoy family movies with a good story and aimed at helping animals, you will love this movie. The picture and sound quality are great. The price is extremely reasonable on the Special Edition version (twelve dollars and twenty-six cents), and it is a movie that should get a good deal of replayability for many years. I checked and you can not find it this reasonable anywhere else. I have seen it selling for twenty-two to thirty dollars everywhere else online or in stores.<br /><br />This is not to mention when you buy it you help support Operation Migration (operationmigration.org). Although the true story of how this all started is a little different, it is still a great one. The Special Edition includes a featurette and documentary that tells not only how they started this migration effort with geese but how they have now helped reintroduce Whooping Cranes to the East coast of the US. Buy it to entertain your family and help support a wonderful non-profit group that values wildlife. Be sure the box says Special Edition. I noticed they put my review at both versions and only one is selling for the price I mentioned above.
B0000028M7|4.0|These are terrific songs.  They really are.  Cantrell's composing and playing are absolutely top-notch.  Staley's lyrics are positively mind numbing, and he sings them with conviction and a sense of dread that has pretty much not been duplicated since.  I can't count the number of times that I played \\"Down in a Hole\\" at a time in my life when I also felt that \\"my wings had been so denied.\\" <br /> <br />I agree with others that one--after more than one listen--can sense a strange sense of optimism in this music.  I can't put my finger on it, but this music really does accomplish its mission of performing a mental \\"primal scream\\" of sorts and has a cleansing effect that can ultimately be positive. <br /> <br />
B0000039QA|5.0|every song is a classic (especially Hypnotize and Mo Money Mo Problems.) There were only a couple classic songs on R.T.D. (Big Poppa and Juicy.) More songs had a better story and meaning that L.A.D. (Hypnotize was about how he likes girls and how they love him and Mo money Mo Problems is him celebrating his riches.) R.T.D. Ready to Die and Machine Gun Funk had no meaning (only 2 examples.) If I could sum it up, R.T.D. is more raw and him talking about drug dealing and robberies while L.A.D. is him celebrating his riches.
B000002GK1|4.0|Soundgarden had a range of influences, but for me this is still a blues album.  In my mind, Chris Cornell is a blues singer, and a damn interesting and fine one at that.  This music accomplishes the hard task of even pleasing \\"metal\\" fans while still very clearly maintaining a true blues aesthetic.  \\"Rusty Cage\\" is beyond aerobic in its excecution, and \\"Outshined\\" is to me an absolute blues classic, in its pounding insistence and powerful kick in the crotch rhythm.
B0000039PW|5.0|The best songs are Juicy, Big Popp and Warning. Pick this up. It's raw, real, deals with robberies, sex, drugs and money. It's not vanilla ice, it's Notorious BIG.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions completes the saga of science fiction fantasy films brought to us in part by Larry and Andy Wachowski (hope I spelled that correctly).  The film stars Keanu Reeves (A Walk in the Clouds, Speed) as Neo, the super empowered liberator of the human race, Laurence Fishburne (Just Cause, Boyz in the Hood) as Morpheus, one of the wise leaders of the human resistance movement, Carrie-Anne Moss (Memento, New Blood) as Trinity, a dedicated freedom fighter and the love of Neo's life, and Hugo Weaving (Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, LOTR Trilogy) as the renegade program and Neo's arch nemesis Agent Smith.<br /><br />  Alone, the film stands as a great visual and cinematic achievement.  As a final sequel, it suffers from the all too infamous \\"Sequel Rule\\" that has plagued American cinema for decades.  The Wachowskis broke new ground with the original and why they failed to achieve the same success with this film is the basis of this review.  While there are many good things about this film, custom dictates that you dispense with the bad news first, so here goes: WARNING! Spoiler-laden<br /><br />What doesn't work:<br /><br />1) CGI over use.  Like Star Wars Ep.II, this film suffers from an overuse of the overrated CGI technology.  This causes some of the action scenes to be at best choppy and the Sentinel war and the final fight to suffer from a lack of realism and ending up cartoonish.  Better use of the CGI was done in the first two films.<br /><br />2)  Character utilization.  Morpheus, the Oracle, Seti, and most of the other players are poorly utilized in the film.  Perhaps if Morpheus had been at the last stand with Mifune, he could have gone out with the proverbial bang that his character deserved.  Instead he's left crying about the end of the war and how happy he is. It was all just a trifle bit sappy and pathetic.<br /><br />3)  The conclusion.  The most obvious problem is how rushed the ending was and how it leaves the audience and the trilogy with no sense of closure.  The machines are not defeated as we had been led to believe, rather, they enter into a temporary truce with Zion orchestrated by Neo.  Then, the Oracle says that Neo will be heard from again.  Rather an odd statement considering that the Wachowskis have gone on record of saying that there will be no further sequels and Neo dying as a result of being too powerful for Smith to assimilate.  The ending I had envisioned was that Neo would take control of the Machines and the Matrix and shut it all down, thus killing himself and saving Zion.  Everything is left up in the air and it was all too rushed.<br /><br />What works:<br /><br />  1) The death of Trinity.  At least one or two major characters have to die in a film of this magnitiude.  This gives the film a hint of realism in that this shows that success and freedom and all of the other civil liberties we take for granted ultimately come at a price.<br /><br />  2) Agent Smith.  Hugo Weaving continues to dazzle us with his uncanny and over-the-top performance as Smith.  He is a villain's villain in every sense and in my opinion, should be counted among cinema history's most popular and memorable villains.  The scene that truly defined Smith as a character was his last speech to Neo during their final fight in which he urges Neo to give up the fight because all of the things he was fighting for (peace, love, truth, freedom) were only human delusions and that love itself was meaningless because it was invented by humans.<br /><br />  3)  Captain Mifune's last stand.  This scene captivated me because it shows the measure of a how far one ws willing to go to support his cause and when faced with insurmountable odds, he does not back down. Mifune was probably a character that we should have seen more of.<br /><br />  4)  The film score.  Don Davis' score is electrifying and pulsating. It moves the troubled plot along and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat and gives the film a last saving grace.at and gives the film a last saving grace.
B000002UAF|5.0|Beatlemania was in full throttle when this was released and the Beatles had never sounded better. The tunes are wonderfully memorable and give a hint at the even greater things on the horizon for Lennon and McCartney as composers. This represents a period in which the Beatles sound was still fresh and every song was a surprise. Deservedly a classic.
B000001GXC|5.0|BBC Radio 3 broadcasted the Scottish symphony earlier this year. At the time I was utterly unfamiliar with the work but even during that first exposure--for I was listening--I decided to update my collection as soon as possible. Which I did by buying this CD. (Later I also bought Peter Maag's interpretation of this symphony, but not because I was dissatisfied with the CD I now review. Far from it; both are excellent.) <br /> <br />As illustrated from the Radio 3 example above, I was immediately struck by this music. I can't say if that will also be the case with you (because the value of art is often of a personal nature), but do find an opportunity to find out for yourself. As usual, music of this caliber becomes better over time, certainly if you really focus on it (my opinion).  <br /> <br />Considering the other reviews, I think indeed that the orchestra is massive here. Some nuance may be lost in some instances but the overall effect of \\"wild winds roaring down mountains\\" (not exactly a quote) adds to the (*my*) experience.  <br /> <br />I do very much recommend this CD, because even if you aren't stunned by The Scottish, there's also The Hebrides (great) and The Italian symphony. <br /> <br />--You may also want to check out Peter Maag's Scottish (on Decca Legendary Performances).
0679777547|4.0|The quality of this book's prose was very accomplished and the general subject matter was interesting with regard to book-binding and forgeries. I can't say that the plot was entirely convincing because their was no particularly strong reason for Corso to not simply hand over the chapter he got from LaPonte, and he could easily have stolen the `The Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows' from Fargas, himself, or Balkan could have done so, too, since he killed Fargas for it anyway.    I found the line drawings/engravings good to look at.     The film adaptation `The Ninth Gate, was a surprisingly good one, but it too had a few plot flaws.    That said, it reads well. and would encourage reading more books by this author.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I had heard through the grapevine that Mulholland Drive was absolutely spectacular.  The Cannes Film Festival was raving about it, and well, something made me take a ride to buy this DVD.  I had never seen it before, and other than Dan Hedaya, I didn't really know any of the names (I saw this before I saw The Ring).  I wasn't really familiar with David Lynch's work before.  So I threw the DVD in with an open mind, and was completely amazed for 2 hours and 30 minutes. <br /> <br />I can't really even give a plot description other than this, and even the description on the back of the DVD is incredibly vague and somewhat misleading.  Basically, a woman (Laura Elena Harding) who we come to know as \\"Rita\\" (although, she acquired this from a Rita Hayworth poster), was in a rather serious accident, and came out unscathed, other than having amnesia, and escapes to a house on Sunset, where the occupant seems to be leaving to go somewhere.  Enter Betty (Naomi Watts), as it seems that she will be able to use this house while she's trying to make her career in acting.  Also in the mix is a mildly successful director, named Adam, who is being controlled by an agency to cast a certain girl in his new movie.  Rita and Betty strike up a friendship which evolves into passion until everything unravels, and we're in a different universe.  That's pretty much the best way I can describe it, without giving everything away. <br /> <br />Now, I'm not usually one to speak omnisciently about how one might feel watching this amazing film, but in this case, I think it's viable.  You're going to throw this in, and for the first 105 minutes, you're going to be bewildered.  Nothing seems to make sense, and everything is just a wee bit melodramatic.  Everything will seem disconnected, and meaningless.  And then the last 45 minutes will come, and you'll be even more confused, unless you have a real acute sense of attention, and miraculous understanding.  Maybe this seems like I'm straying you away<br /> <br />But here's the thing, and trust me when I say this.  Every scene is there for a reason.  The way people act, behave, and socialize is all very important, along with everyone's lifestyles.  The true genius here is in how it's all put together, how the director deliberately fools you into thinking that everything is absolutely meaningless and disconnected, and you may wonder why you wasted your time.  I was too determined to figure out what was going on to give up on this movie, and man, it just opens up a whole new line of thinking. <br /> <br />If you want something that will tickle your brain, so you can stray away from Spiderman, and all these commercially-fond movies, then I definitely recommend this, because your brain will have to be on full to fully absorb everything this film has to offer.  Naomi Watts delivers an Oscar-worthy performance here.  Not recommended to anyone under 18 (it is Rated R), for sexual themes, and full nudity.  Keep an open mind throughout, and remember that everything you see will have its explanation.  You just have to find it. <br />
B000002OX5|5.0|`Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', released with much fanfare in the Summer of 1968 is often touted as marking the birth of the concept album. Those who think this are not aware of this album, `The Who Sell Out', which is recorded and copywrited in 1967, and which is as much or more of a concept album than `Sargent Pepper' ever was. The whole album simulates a broadcast of a London `top 40' radio station with singles, commercials and weather reports. The commercials are the basis of the very droll pics of band members on the cover with real (Heinz baked beans) and imaginary (Odorono) products. The great irony of this album is that the performances of The Who are as big a part of modern advertisments and major TV show themes as they or any other 1960's rock legend are or ever have been.<br /><br />Bill Gates and Mick Jagger separately have created enough trends to fill about a dozen careers, with some left over. So, it's a little surprising to see them responsible for a trend created in cooperation with one another, and to see that The Who have been by far the greatest beneficiaries of this trend, especially from works on the album, `Who's Next'. The trend is the use of songs written and recorded by major 1960's rock groups in advertising campaigns. The story I heard was that Bill Gates personally approached Mick with the proposal to use the song `Start it Up' as part of the campaign to release Windows '95. Jagger was not especially keen to do it, but didn't want to turn down flat, so he set a figure so high that he thought even Gates and Microsoft's deep pockets would balk, but Bill called Jagger's bluff, and we get the Rolling Stones endorsing Microsoft through the use of one of their lesser songs.<br /><br />Of all the great 1960's bands, I can think of no group which reuses material quite as much as `The Who'. The closest case of self plagerizing I can think of is the string of opening cuts on Stones albums, beginning with `Jumping Jack Flash', followed by `Street Fighting Man', followed by `Gimme Shelter'. If you are familiar with `Tommy', listening to `The Who Sell Out' is akin to watching a performance of `Hamlet' where so many lines sound like cliches, because the play is so much a part of our psyche that its original lines have become cliches. Townsend reuses both musical phrases and story lines from his earliest work through `Who's Next' and `The Who Sell Out' is smack in the middle of this period.<br /><br />I always thought `The Who Sell Out' was a treasure trove of lost Townsend classics. The showstopper on the album is `I Can See For Miles' which probably did not really work well as a concert piece. The other high points are `Rael' which is one of Townsends little stories in song with echos in the final cut of `Tommy', that is, `We're Not Gonna Take It' and `Armenia City in the Sky', which was not written by Townsend, but by John Keene. Another little gem, possibly influence by fellow Brit Band, The Nice, is The Who's take on Greig's `Hall of the Mountain King'. Take that Keith Emerson.<br /><br />Reeling off the list of great Rolling Stones tunes above makes me think that Pete Townsend will never be that well remembered for individual songs (with the possible exception of `My Generation') as for album ideas and, dare we forget, live performances. After almost 40 years of performing on the stage, when Townsend and Daltry and Entwistle took the stage at Paul McCartney's memorial concert for 9/11, they stole the show with a selection of their live performance classics.<br /><br />On this album, the performances are a bit weaker than on `Live at Leeds' and, more appropriately, on `Who's Next'. Daltry's tenor seems just a bit strained on several cuts and the instrumentals just don't seem to have the groundshaking power of some later albums. That may have a lot to do with the album concept, as a top 40 station is not likely to play much of what sounds like heavy metal, especially in 1967.<br /><br />If one were not a big Who fan to begin with, the repetition of phrasings and lyric stories may be a bit tedious. For the true believers, it is often like running into an old friend or taking a deep drag on a cigarette after a long hiatus. It also means, I believe, that the level of quality in the Original Who releases is very high, as Townsend was always concerned with how songs worked together on an album, not only when he was fleshing out a concept. I just wish he would have given more attention to some of his album covers. What was clever in 1967 seems trivial and cheap for a great band in 2004.<br /><br />This is not their best album, but I would not miss it for the world. Buy The Who!/>If one were not a big Who fan to begin with, the repetition of phrasings and lyric stories may be a bit tedious.

B0002TT0NM|5.0|I read in a recent Entertainment Weekly article that there was so much cutting of the film before they even started filming that some scenes that you may expect to see in the extras probably will not be there due to the time crunch.  <br /> <br />However, the movie, in my opinion, was done beautifully. For the amount of time that it did run, it all flowed smoothly and the cinematography of the whole movie is excellent because of the great new director in this film, Alfonso Cuaron. I totally recommend this movie, although there might not be too many deleted scenes.  <br />[...]
B0001AP12G|2.0|I really didnt like this...It is so over hyped it aint even funny..the only songs I was feeling was Through the wire, Jesus Walks, and All falls down..everything else is just ok..and too many skits..it was a little childish..should have been called high school drop out..cause some of the lyrics are childish.
B00003CXPD|5.0|As a male ballet dancer who is not gay(most male ballet dancers are not gay, contrary to what some may think) I would like to point something out about this story that seems obvious, but has not been pointed out from what I have seen.( I will assume that the reader of this is already familiar with some of the other reviews.)  Basically, the overall plot is that if you are a guy, you don't have to be gay to dance ballet, but the story presents us with the following facts:  Billy is very uncomfortable with his girlfriend, turning down a kiss offered to him by her(and more) offering her a pillow fight as a diversion; Billy seems quite comfortable with his gay guy friend(nothing wrong with that),he even kisses him goodby near the end; Billy shows homophobia at the Royal Ballet School when a fellow male student innocently touches his hand to console him; finally, when we see Billy dancing as a professional adult, he is in a famous homoerotic version of Swan Lake.  Gee wiz, we might almost conclude that maybe the story is trying to tell us something else here.  Of course these issues are not resolved in the story.  I still recommend this movie highly(there are also some wonderful surreal elements to the story,such as when Billy's girlfriend innocently runs a stick across a line of riot policemen as if they were a picket fence); it is definitely worth seeing, but why is this aspect not being discussed?
B00005JMAH|5.0|First off... try not to listen to some of the despariging reviews some people have written about the movie not doing the book justice .  While the movie doesn't copy the book page by page, it gets the story across in an entertaining manner.  People griping about not including the origins of the Maurader's Map need to keep in mind it's a nice backstory element... but certainly not integral to the main story.  People also gripe about not introducing Cedric or Cho in this film.  To that I must respond with:  WHY introduce them in this film when they have no influence on the story being told?  Sure they both play major parts in the next movie/book... but there is little reason to have them in THIS movie.  The only thing that *I* feel should have been taken from the book and filmed is the way the book ended (I won't spoil it for people who haven't read the book.)  All in all, it's a good movie..  Good special effects, good acting, and a good story.  Another fine entry in the Harry Potter film franchise.

B000067J1H|5.0|Edward Norton and Brad Pitt take you by the shirt and hurtle you into a incredible thrill ride that will excite you from your head to toes. Director David Fincher (Seven, Panic Room) streched the rules a little bit farther. Using his incredible cinematrography skills to really bring the film alive, David Fincher also uses very talented actors to make 'Fight Club' a work of art. <br />Although the DVD only has commentary and no other special features, the movie makes it great without it. The 'Two Disc Edition' would probably be a better buy for all of you 'Fight Club' fanatics. <br />Fight Club is about a anxious insomniac who despretely is looking for a release that will help him go to sleep soundly. He finally finds a release within cancer groups. He begins to sleep again, but when his apartment blows up he must seek help in a slippery soap salesman named Tyler Durden. Tyler and Him then build underground boxing clubs called fight club. But when Tyler starts to take fight club a little to far our hero needs to decide which side is he on. Society or Tylers. <br />The film is a graphic depiction of many things, male aggression, clever humor. Clever Humor, is a big thing in this movie. Watch carefully for certain things that are pointed it out, if you don't catch them the first time (which is highly likely) watch it again, and again.
B000002IWQ|2.0|I'm a huge Rush fan- they're easily one of my all time favorites- but this record is downright embarrasing to listen to. All the riffs and hooks are great, but the lyrics- holy crap! The cheesiest stuff you'll ever hear. From the opening track, we get this line: \\"My counterpart, my foolish heart. Man must learn to rule his tender part\\". Wow. It's unintentionally funny- your buddies will get a good laugh out of it. \\"Between Sun & Moon\\" and \\"Leave that thing alone\\" are the best tracks, by far. The second one is another great instrumental, and thankfully, no vocals on this one. Get ANY other Rush record before this one - there are about 30 of them, I think. Test for Echo is much better.
B0001M3MZ2|1.0|Let me ask that age-old question; can this get any dumber? More than likely yes. The show could bring in yet another pathetic teenager who has been infected by the meteor rocks and goes down in another pathetic stand off against the incredible dull and loser Clark Kent. Need I say more??? <br /> <br />How about a history lesson? <br />Clark Kent is not actually real, but a disguise to hide the identity of Superman. He came to earth as a baby (NOT a toddler) to survive the destruction of his home planet Krypton. He grows up as a farm boy in the town of Smallville where his powers appear and mature. He has no friends, (no Chloe, no Pete, and especially not a young Lex Luther) but there is a Lana Lang who is his love interest. He can never be with her because she can never know his secret. Clark grows into a young man and then assuming the role of Superboy where he deals with foes with extraordinary powers that come from outer space, other dimensions, and areas OUTSIDE of Smallville. That us when he becomes brief friends with Lex Luther and fatal disaster destroys their relationship and thus becoming enemies. Finally as he becomes a man, his destiny is complete by taking up the role as Superman. In order to fit into society he disguises himself once again as a news reporter for The Metropolis Daily Planet and meets his true love Louis Lane. And still the foes come stronger and harder then ever, even the dreaded Doomsday. Thus there is the life of Superman WHO BECOMES Clark Kent. <br /> <br />SEASON ONE: Toddler Ka-El comes to Earth during a meteor shower and grows up into high school freshman Clark Kent. (Who looks like he's been held back for four years along with everyone else attending Smallville High) He learns of his origins and deals with special powers that arise which help him with the lame and everyday events. They also help him deal with troubled residents who have been affected by meteor rocks and keeps on screwing up his chances of getting a girlfriend witheither the beautiful Lana Lang or his friend the article writer Chloe. After saving the life of a Lex Luthor whom is in his twenties, Clark becomes best friends with him, which only complicates the burden of keeping his powers and origins a secret. <br /> <br />The only thing that this season had going for it was cute young women and an okay soundtrack. The crisis that arise become so repetitive that you just wished they would stop showing up, but then you'd have to watch an hour of a teenager and his friends hanging out trying to hide their true feelings from another. The special effects are cool but that's all that matters to these days now isn't it?    <br /> <br />SEASON TWO: More of Clark's powers surface to help him do battle against pathetic threats and his friendships either grew or slowly begin to fall apart. <br /> <br />Once again this show is very repetitive and only has pretty women, a good soundtrack, and cool special effects going for it. You keep finding yourself wanting to scream; \\"JUST PUT CLARK AND LANA TOGETHER SINCE YOU'VE KILLED THE STORY OF SUPERMAN!\\" At least Christopher Reeves makes an appearance but his part is so boring you've got to wonder how much the show paid him to be in it. The finale is interesting because Jor-El finally shows up and demands Clark to face his destiny. <br /> <br />SEASON THREE: After fighting his addiction to red kryptonite, Clark returns to Smallville to try to fix and pick things back up with Lana. <br /> <br />The premiere was okay because it was dealing with Superman ideas, and so was the episode where a drunken Perry White makes a stop in Smallville for the same reason. Other than that, things are the same for the story line and the effects. Once again Christopher Reeves makes an appearance, which is just beyond me knowing why. This season was the most disappointing of all because the viewer was expecting Clark to at least become Superboy, which he never did. Jor-El calls Clark home and the finale ends there.<br /> <br />SEASON FOUR: All that can be said is that it returns in September and a young Louis Lane comes into play. <br /> <br />Hopefully when Clark returns from the Krypton dimension, he will assume the role of Superboy. (That's probably asking too much though isn't it?) This show should have been canceled long ago during the first season and should have been an embarrassment to everyone involved, but I guess everyone is on drugs. What the writers and creators don't get is; Superman is always Superman, he can never stop being him. Clark Kent is just a disguise to hide that fact. This show is not about Superman and sadly it's not even about Superboy. It's about a boy named Clark Kent, who has a Jonathan and Martha Kent as parents, has a friend named Lex Luthor, lives in a town named Smallville, and just happens to have super powers that helps him in a crisis, but the show is not about Superman or Superboy. I am disgusted to see the Superman emblem on this show.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin's voice conveys SO much feeling. I find myself belting out his songs wherever I am listening to them.  I highly recommend Chariot to lovers of heartfelt songwriting.  Chariot Stripped showcases an even deeper level of Gavin's talent for tweeking his own work thanks to touring. I personally cannot wait to see him live!!!!
0380789035|5.0|This is the first anything that I've read by Neil Gaiman.  I don't know about his comics or other novels, but I do know that this is a wonderful book that is very well written.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't understand it, although I don't know why.  (Perhaps they should stick to the comics?)  He certainly did his mythological research!  Thanks for such a wonderful novel!
B000000H57|5.0|Everything comes together perfectly on this album, there really isn't a weak point or song anywhere. This is one of the best gothic albums I've heard, though I wouldn't neccassarily classify Type O as a gothic band. Pete Steele is an amazing singer and gots a real deep voice. He's one of five singers I've ever heard do the extemely deep vocals really well, Johan Edlund of Tiamat, Dust of ...How Like A Winter, Nick Holmes of Paradise Lost and Dan Swano of too many projects to list being the others. The music is dirgy, slow and ambiant, almost like someone threw Black Sabbath, My Dying Bride and Paradise Lost in a blender and Type O is what came out. If your into gothic or interesting music in general you'll probably love this album. I also recommend checking out Tiamat, Katatonia, Paradise Lost, Lacuna Coil, and Anathema in addition to this.
0385509456|5.0|When I read \\"The Curious Incident...\\" for the first time, I was a bit frightened, because the main character and narrator was me.  Christopher is just a British and male younger version of myself.  The author got it right when he showed Christopher's nitpicking at all the minute details.  I also thought that it was a good thing the book was relatively short, because I don't think that either Christopher or myself could sit and concentrate that long on a fictional story.

B000002N2P|5.0|Its been a while since ive listened to Green Day (they were the first band i liked when i was younger) but hearing their new song, &#34;American Idiot&#34;, revived some interest into this simple, yet great pop-punk band.. <br /> <br />Insomniac, their 'Darkest Album' (although somewhat positive, which makes it easy to like) is an often overlooked one, and makes me wonder why everyone just reccommends 'Dookie', but its a great album, with good lyrics, like the quote-worthy 'Walking Contradiction. Billie Joe's Guitar has always been simple, but fits the music very well, and Mikes bass is as good as ever <br /> <br />Armatage Shanks  - Great opener to the album 9/10 <br />Brat - Probably the weekest song on the album, but not entirely bad 7/10 <br />Stuck with me - A fast, angsty song 8.5/10 <br />Geek Stink Breath - One of their heavier songs 9/10 <br />No Pride - Not much to say about it, but its good 8/10 <br />Bab Ulva Who - Very hyper song with a good beat, but loses it toward the end <br />86 - Like 'brat', nothing special 7/10 <br />Panic Song - a 2 minute buildup to a heavy and fast song 9/10 <br />Stuart and The Avenue - good song, cool bass, too 8.5/10 <br />Brain Stew - A bit a of a change from the mediaum-fast tempo songs, which isnt a bad thing, also a cool song when you cant sleep 8.5/10 <br />Jaded - a great song to play on full volume.. probably their 2nd fastest song ('I hate you' being the fastest) 9/10 <br />WestBound Sign - Nothing special but not bad 7.5/10 <br />Tightwad Hill - Catchy, fast song 8/10 <br />Walking Contradiction - True masterpiece of the album, it was the second GD song i heard, and still one of the best. The Lyrics are truly amazing, making for some great quotes (like 'Talk is cheap and Lies are expensive') with somewhat catchy guitar work, and an awesome video, too 10/10 <br /> <br />Walking Contradiction is the standout song of the album, but its an almost flawless CD, i recommend this over any green day album, although you might not be able to appreciate it unless you heard all of them &#60;_&#60; <br />
B00005JLMH|3.0|Ridley Scott's 1992 film on the controversial explorer and his irreversible impact on the native peoples of the Americas.  Scott struggles to keep this film afloat with his usual mastery of scene selection and cinematocraphy but the film sinks under the weight of a poor screenplay and bad acting.    Not too much mystery on this story as the film covers Cristopher Columbus' explorations for the Spanish crown starting in 1492.  The film follows Columbus as he tries to find a passage to India but comes upon the hitherto unknown American continent.  The film shows him as a friendly figure whose attempts to make peace with the natives is frustrated by the greedy machinations of stereotypical gold-thirsty Spanish nobles.    This is one of Scott's least memorable films.  Gerard Depardieu was miscast as the explorer and his broken English didn't help.  The plot is rather contrived and tries to simplify complex cultural and socio-political developments into a good vs. bad story with our fallen hero in the middle.  Rent if you must but this is one Riddley Scott film I wouldn't recommend buying.
B00009NHC5|5.0|That's what Audrey Hepburn plays in Wait Until Dark, based on the play by Frederick Knott, the genius behind Dial M For Murder.  Her role as Suzy Hendrix is one of the most challenging, as she played a physically handicapped person.  She prepared by going to the Lighthouse for the Blind academy in Manhattan, and spent time with a student, who showed how she found her way around a room.  Audrey also took Braille lessons, covering her eyes with black shields, walking with a stick, and applying makeup without a mirror.  Then there were the contact lens, used to simulate the blank look conveyed by blind people.  Given the calibre of this movie, Ms. Hepburn passes with flying colours.<br /><br />Now, for the World's Champion Blind Lady's Story.  Suzy, who lost her sight in an accident, becomes the unwitting pawn by three crooks desperate to regain a doll her husband was given for safekeeping by a blonde at an airport.  Seems that Lisa, the blonde, was smuggling heroin in the doll, trying to double cross Roat, the ringleader of the crooks, and was murdered for her duplicity. Roat blackmails his reluctant cohorts, Mike Talman and Carlino, into helping him, but offers them $2,000 each to help him search for the doll.<br /><br />Mike passes himself as a Marine buddy of her husband Sam and wins her confidence.  All the while, a large VW van parked across the street by the phone booth serves as their center of operations.  Roat-played to slimy perfection by Alan Arkin, whose favourite toy is a knife named Geraldine, is quite the mastermind.  He arranges things so Sam has to go to Asbury Park for an all-day photo job so that he and his cohorts can come and go to the Hendrix's flat under various pretences to search for the doll, and gain information from our heroine.  At one point, he disguises himself as his own father, breaks into Suzy's house on the pretence of thinking his daughter-in-law is having an affair with a photographer named Sam Hunt.  That leads to Talman, a convenient witness, calling for the police, actually Carlino at the phone booth, posing as a police sergeant.  Roat himself gives Suzy a half-truth of the story, mentioning a doll.  Suzy does remember Sam bringing home a doll he was looking after, but the doll has mysteriously vanished.<br /><br />The crooks are thus desperate to find the doll and Suzy is desperate to clear her husband.  It doesn't take her long to figure out that a missing woman found murdered was the same woman who passed the doll to Sam, and that Sam will be implicated unless the doll is found.  This challenge exemplifies Sam's pushing Suzy to be the world's champion blind lady, trying to be more self-reliant, and as much of her former self while she still had her sight.<br /><br />That leads to a scene where she drops a salt shaker and uses her hand in a circular sweeping motion to find it.  All the while, she tells Sam she doesn't like Gloria, a pouty bespectacled teenager named Gloria, whose family life is less than stable.  She says she prefers a dog, but as Sam says, dogs can't go shopping.<br /><br />At one point, Suzy muses that there are some things she wants to do, such as pick out wallpaper or colours for the house, something she can never do with this dark brown she constantly sees.  Yet her sense of hearing has improved.  She notes that Mr. Roat and his father's shoes had the same new shoe squeak.  She also remarks to Gloria that Carlino and Roat were playing with the blinds.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in Suzy's apartment, remaining true to its stage origins.  And Wait Until Dark is a well-paced thriller that comes alive when Suzy finally figures things out, highlighted by a climactic gripping scene in the near dark of the flat, with Suzy being terrorized by the odious Roat.<br /><br />\\"She is really something,\\" Mike says of her at one point, and Suzy is a heroine to root for.  Nominated for but losing the Best Actress award, this was Hepburn's last great film and last Oscar nomination.  It marked the end of an era as well as the end of her marriage to Mel Ferrer, who produced this film, and a nine year hiatus broken by Robin and Marian.last Oscar nomination.

B00005R2IS|4.0|George Miller launched Mel Gibson's career in this low-budget film about a solo cop who's out for justice after his partner and family are killed by ruffians.  Although the film doens't have the explicit apocalyptic theme and plot of its sequel, this film has plenty of high-speed chases and tension to keep the audience entertained.    Mad Max (Gibson) is one of a few cops in a small town being ravaged by a motorcyle gang.  After several tragedies, Mad Max is left alone is swears to exact vengeance on the gang of outlaws.    Again, the film isn't too clear about its setting: there's no express indication that this is in a post-apocalyptic future as with the film's sequels.  The theme and plot is more along the lines of a standard 'Dirty Harry' or 'Death Wish' film.  Despite these differences, the film is still a great film to watch with plenty of suspense and action.  A great film to watch many times.
B00003CXFG|5.0|A lot of people will knock a movie down a stars because it does not have an amazing complex plot that will force you to think and will be full of little sutlties in the begginging that turn into somthing huge later. For those of you that need that to enjoy a movie, this film is not for you. But for those of you who just want a little bit of excitement, cool death scenes, awesome characters, and really good suspense then this movie is for you. <br /> <br />I am a pretty big Vin Diesal fan, not because of his acting, because lets all face it, he is one of the worst actors on the screen, but because of his style, and the way he can carry his characters. He is one of the ultimate tough guys, and this movie he deffinitly does his best performance. For once he actually seems to know how to act, because this role seemed to be written without too much range, but like I said earlier if you are looking for somthing like that this is the wrong movie for you. This movie is very fun though. <br /> <br />One of the great things about this film as in most good horror films a lot of stuff goes wrong even when they come up with a plan, there is a lot of backstabbing in this movie, which is always great,(Both physically and mentally). And the aliens or whatever they are, kick butt. They can attack fast and when they kill someone it is very cool, and if you are into that sort of thing, very funny. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for a fun, mindless action film with lots of suspense then this is the one for you. NUFF SAID.
B0000214F0|1.0|This was a request Caligula made frequently so that he could be entertained and I certainly feel like I'm dying each time I see this film. If only that was Tinto Brass' and Bob Guccione's real intention I would have given them a mark of excellence in making this film. Unfortuntely, their pornographic backgrounds with 'Penthouse' did very little for this film in terms of artistic quality as a drama or historical thriller. Not surprising if you see that Tinto Brass' only contribution to film and direction is pornographic in nature. Instead, history was used as a flimsy backdrop for a purely modern pornographic film. An utterly tasteless film in which no amount of acting talent could possibly save from its horrible screenplay, mediocre direction, and tasteless emphasis on sex.  <br /> <br />The film covers the reign of Caligula, the Roman emperor who reigned for only 3 short years after succeeding Tiberius. The Roman emperor who would become infamous for his demented cruelty and sexual perversions. Although it would be impossible to remove sex or violence from a film about Caligula, the screenplay in this film mostly emphasizes his sexual exploits to bring its Penthouse tramps to the forefront. The acting is clearly of secondary importance in the film as demonstrated by measely dialogues the lines of which were mostly extracted from the anecdotal history of Suetonius. There's no real character development for any of the personnages: the dialogue is simply used to foreshadow or introduce another risque sex scene. The sexual scenes are so pervasive that it isn't worth seeing the rated version because it has nothing to show. Absent the erotic scenes, the backdrops are cheap and not even historically faithful. If the collective talents of Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren can't make a film any good then it must really be very bad as the latter are some of the finest theatrical actors.  <br /> <br />Avoid this film at all costs unless you want to see it for its pornographic quality (an oximoron in my book.) The narrowly focused 'skills' in directing plotless pornography takes are simply not a measure of film competence in directing narrative (i.e. plot-driven) film. The minimal narrative in pornography serves only to set a fantasy scene that will erotically arouse its audience as opposed to continuing an actual story. The result of Brass applying such limited filming and narrative techniques to a historical drama is obvious. I can just imagine his direction at work in this film: 'Moan louder! Good! Bite your lip! That's it! Remember you are are a subservient Roman slave complying to your powerful emperor's rectitude! Uhh... O'Toole and you other guys just keep doing whatever it is you're doing while I work with the actors here!\\" Seriously now, the one and only great cinematic performance of Caligula is the one by John Hurt in the BBC production of 'I, Claudius.' Caligula is a very difficult role to play and John Hurt's rendition couldn't be more demonically sociopathic or cruelly mischevious than what I imagine seeing when reading Suetonius. Even more credit to him is that he delivered an outstanding performance without the benefit of being the central character or having a lavish production at his disposal.  <br />
B000002H70|5.0|Now, don't get me mistaken for one of these little creepy melodramatic \\"Cure\\" fans....who dabble that they wouldnt have lived as if it was not for Disentergration. It is a great album....maybe one of the best of all time. So, here's my review for \\"Disentergration\\" <br /> <br />1. Plainsong- I really enjoy this song in a way it reminds me of Enya....but, the darkness and love lyrics just makes it more listanable. <br /> <br />2. Pictures of You- I'm not a big fan of long drowning out songs, but the songs on disentergration tell a different story. Pictures of you is just a great song ....nothing else to it. <br /> <br />3. Closedown- This is probally my least favorite of the songs,but its still a great song....dark and mixed with great instrumentals. <br /> <br />4. Lovesong- To me it is hands down the song that made me actually like music...I used to be in really crappy music then a couple of years ago I heard this song and was blown away. Great song. <br /> <br />5. Last Dance- Very intresting it delivers odd melodies...sounds similar to Plainsong. <br /> <br />6. Lullaby- Great song....with a dark meaning hiding under the great rock sound. <br /> <br />7. Fascination Street- An excellent song...its my favorite on the album and it just is whoa!. <br /> <br />The last couple of songs are just excellent they have made me become so glad I am a cure fan... I wish they were some more albums like this. Because when people say Pornography is the dark one...well it is,but it does get old. They say Bloodflowers is dark also...although its their second greatest album it just is not that dark as people say. So, if you are a startiong out Cure fan I highly recomend \\"Disentergration\\"
0783114893|4.0|Director Robert Harman's 1984 film about an innocent drive-away driver (C. Thomas Howell) fleeing from the relentless pusuit of a psychotic hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer.)  Although the screenplay is rather generic and the story predictable, this short film stays above your average 'B' movie due to outsanding performances by Howell and Hauer. <br /> <br />The plot is pretty simple and rather generic.  A drive-away driver (Howell) on a is on the road to a new life in Los Angeles but something goes terribly wrong while he's driving through the Southwest.  He gives a ride to a mysterious passenger (Rutger Hauer) who reveals himself as a deranged killer.  The suspense builds as Howell's character seems unable to elude his antagonist. Blamed for the murders, Howell must also deal with pursuing law enforcment. <br /> <br />Although the film's basic story-line is rather generic, Howell and Hauer make a great acting pair.  Each actor is completely immersed in his character and they deliver great performances.  There's also a minor role played by a very young Jennifer Jason Leigh playing Howell's companion.   <br /> <br />This is a good suspense thriller that has acquired somewhat of a cult following.  For this reason, I give this film 4-stars in that it manages staying above your typical 'B' movie category.  A fun movie to watch multiple times.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Diane Keaton has never been a favorite of mine (loved her in Manhattan, but she was average in a lot of decidedly average films) but she really deserved a lot more praise for the work she did in this film - I thought she was superb. Really outstanding.<br /><br />Nicholson,of course, put in his usual fine job as well, and the two of them together was inspired casting.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves displayed all the personality of an umbrella stand.<br /><br />I saw the movie in a cinema that had an audience that was decidedly 'mature'; I'd say probably 90% of it was aged 40-60 years old, and some of the women in the audience were sobbing softly during parts of the movie, so it certainly resonated with the audience.<br /><br />I don't want to give the impression that it's a sad movie, but rather, poignant and bittersweet, but only in parts - in fact, some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Not a great movie, but certainly a very good one.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Ridley Scott directs the sequel to the original 'Silence of the Lambs.'  Not a terribly memorable sequel in terms of story line or acting; counting more on gore scenes to shock the audience instead of presenting any real substance in plot or theme.    Unlike its predecessor where Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) was more of a secondary character, this film is focused entirely on finding the escaped cannibal doctor.  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster)tags along with an obnoxious fellow agent (Ray Liotta) to capture the elusive doctor.  She also gets help from one of Lecter's former victims named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman.)    Not a terribly memorable sequel except for graphic scenes that, quite frankly, go too far in the domain of bad taste (literally.)  I really don't need up-close, in your face, scenes of human dissection and dismemberment to imagine what it would be like to be served as someone else's dinner.  The final scene displaying how human brains should be served was too disgusting even for my broad tastes in gratuitous violence.  The graphic content of this film was so extreme that Jodie Foster refused to reprise the role she had played so well in the previous film.    All in all, I find this to be one of the worst films directed by Riddley Scott and certainly the worse of the four Hannibal Lecter films to be made ('Manhunter' was the first one.)  Worth renting for those who have the stomach but, again, this is certainly not a film for the faint of heart or those who have a light stomach for blood and guts.
B000005KQT|4.0|Great collection, but I am missing Little Walter's cover of Willie Dixon's \\"Dead Presidents\\" which is on the Chess Box Willie Dixon Collection - why wouldn't it be here? Chess owns the rights to the song, and it's a magnificent representation of Little Walter's powers as a blues musician. Other than that omission, it's perfect!
0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott's 1983 science fiction film dealing with what makes one 'human'.  A futuristic film noir with great acting, cinematography, and direction. <br /> <br />Decker is a police detective in charge of 'retiring' derelict replicants: human androids manufactured by Tyrell Corp.  His new assignment is to track down several replicants on a killing spree against certain Tyrell Corp. employees.  What's their motive?  Can they be stopped?  What will Decker find out when he does stop them?  <br /> <br />This is a great film with various themes.  The plot is more along the lines of your standard detective film.  The acting talents of Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh, are complemented by the great directing skills of Ridley Scott.  The film also has a great soundtrack composed by Vangelis.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Yes, its true these are his movies, But remember everyone that he got rich from us paying to see those movies. So in a way he gave them to us. These are characters most of us grew up with, a part of are past if you will. Im sorry but it is arrogent for a writter or film maker to think his or her work belongs to just themselves when they get their fame and fortune from us.  <br /> <br />If they truely feel that way, then why do they publish their works? In a sense they're giving their works away, so that everyone can enjoy them and I thank them for that. I dont mind the improvements, but I would still like to see the movies I grew up with.  <br /> <br />If only he would released both the original versons and his improved versions, I would have no doubt that everyone would buy both. It just sucks when I only have the old origials to show my kids on VHS.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This 1973 film was a good adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous novel.  Although some of the actors could have been better, I found the film to be faithful to the story and well directed.    The film follows the classic story of Gatsby, a poor man who made a fortune after the Great War and so became the talk of the town. Although Gatsby's wealth could buy anything he wanted, what he really wanted was Daisy: a beautiful but shallow woman whom Gatsby can't get out of his mind.  Daisy is now married and lives across from Gatsby's home.  Gatsby's lavish home and parties are little more than Gatsby's subconscious wooing of Daisy.  But Gatsby was never born in wealth and so wasn't considered 'polite' enough to be with someone like Daisy (Mia Farrow.) This was certainly the opinion of her brute husband (Bruce Dern)who needs to get his jollies on the poor side of town.  Gatsby's only true friend is his narrating neighbor (Law & Order's Sam Waterston.)    I found this adaptation to be just fine.  The film was faithful to the book, well directed, and complimented with a good cast.  Robert Redford plays his role as the humble Gatsby quite well.  A good movie to rent or own.

B000069HZP|4.0|David Fincher's 1997 suspense-thriller regarding an obsessive man's (Michael Douglas) efforts at escaping the threats of an out-of-control entertainment/service firm.  The film's momentum is based entirely on mystery; the suspense building up with each of the main character's unexplainable predicaments which seem to have no rhyme or reason.  Although the story is well crafted with plenty of mystery, this is the sort of film you can only see once because the mystery is completely resolved in the end and leaves no surprises. <br /> <br />Michael Douglas is a wealthy executive whose life is plagued by the vivid memories of his father's suicide.  The tragedy has left him a control freak whose relations with his family and friends are strained at best.  His brother (Sean Penn) invites him to play an undefined game offered by Consumer Recreation Services, a service firm. Michael Douglas' character soon finds himself entangled in a bizzare criminal scheme that he cannot fathom.  How will he get out of this nightmare? <br /> <br />Again, this is a great suspense-thriller to watch only once.  All of the dangling questions are resolved at the end of the film thereby removing any suspense upon the second viewing.  A great movie to rent but it would be a waste of money to own it.
0393035158|5.0|Clearly written and rationally appealing, Sam Harris does a magnificent job of addressing issues of religion and faith within a context of rational discussion.  Combining this critical analysis of religion with the increasingly significant subject of terrorism and martrydom, the book is a must read for religious followers and atheists alike.
B000002UWE|5.0|I just rediscovered Talk Talk this weekend.  They have to be one of the best bands that came out of the 80s and are woefully underappreciated.  I listened to them then and just pulled out this compilation.<br /><br />The music is lush and unexpected - synthesizers suddenly give way to beautiful organ pieces and harmonicas and silence where you would expect noise.<br /><br />I can't urge you enough to give it a listen, because once you listen you'll be a fan.
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|If this were not an Oz film with some allusions back to the Wizard of OZ, this would be even worse. And I WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE! This movie was very disappointing with only a few redeeming qualities. <br /> <br />The plot has little value, what is the plot other then going back to Oz. <br />The characters are so unbelievable, Tic Toc, Pumpkin Head, and the silly guys on wheels are so poorly designed. I never got a sense of caring about any of the characters let alone did they reach the character development of the original where each had a mission. These characters just seem to be in the present, doing what  is right in front of them with no motivation of their own. Another matter of question is why the character don't move their mouth, Tick Tock moves his moustache and the pumkin head barely moves. One would think that since 1939, they could come up with some great characters with great graphics or at least make them adorable, none of which have come to fruition. My God, what happened to the scarecrow, really pathetic compared to the original scarecrow. I wonder what were the art directors of this movie thinking? These characters look like some high school theatre project, without the naive simplicity and innocence. There is no real plot, no higher purpose, no real goals, no great lines, if this was not a sequel to Oz, it would have little value at all. Too bad the new Dorothy did not have a movie to live up to her fine acting and child spirit. Gad, the tin man and lion are jokes. Why does she call the lion the Cowardly Lion cowardly, did not he become courageous? <br /> <br />Dorothy stands out as a child to be reckoned with as an actress and character. The fact that Dorothy looks younger is also odd as well. She is sweet, strong and did a good job, too bad the film did not live up to its promise.  <br /> <br />The new bad guy Nemo has a playful side which is amusing, neither all bad nor all good. The only character who wants something valuable, King Nemo, wants to become fully human, at least he has some goals and he is killed off.   <br /> <br />Simply put, this movie lacked imagination. I am not sure why some people feel a need to defend it as something special, perhaps just to be different. I wish I could have liked it, but my imagination does not go that far. <br />
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Netflixed this one last night. There aren't too many films out there about 50 & 60 year olds getting together; the success of this film should tell the film industry that people do enjoy films that don't revolve around 20-somethings (and that's coming from a 20-something!)<br /><br />Apparently, the roles of Harry and Erica were written specifically for Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton. (Jack and Dianne! It's even a SONG!!) Keaton and Nicholson have amazing on screen chemistry. Nicholson appears to be playing himself in this film ... Harry - an aging bachelor who has never dated a woman over 30. Keaton is an acclaimed playwright, Erica, who hasn't been in any type of relationship since her divorce years earlier. Her life is perfect in every way except in the romance department.<br /><br />Funny circumstances throw these two together - Harry and his newest girlfriend are headed to the Hamptons to spend the weekend at her mother's house (she's supposed to be out of town). But Mom unexpectedly shows up ... guess who! Erica. Much hilarity ensues ... and Harry ends up being forced to stay in the Hamptons at Erica's house. Harry and Erica reluctantly begin to like each other, and eventually - they fall in love. However, the road is rocky as Harry is still clinging to his bachelor life - and can't understand how he could possibly be attracted to someone who is, gasp, over 50!<br /><br />My husband and I both enjoyed this film ... although he did call it a mature chick-flick.
B000286S8S|5.0|Van Halen is the Greatest American Rock Band EVER!!!<br /><br />Here you have 36 original tracks from both Roth's era and Van Hagar. You will be more than pleased to get classics like  Eruption, Ain't talking bout love, Dance the night away, Panama, Hot for teacher;the great covers from Roth's era: You really got me, Pretty Woman and Dancing in the streets; and some of Hagar's best: Dreams, Love walks in, When it's love, Finish what ya started, Poundcake...<br /><br />The three new tracks(It's about time, Up for breakfast & Learning to see) with Hagar are pretty good, and in my opinion much better than the two David Lee Roth tracks recorded for 1996's Best of Volume I.<br /><br />I was surprised that they did not included at least \\"Without You\\" from Van Halen 3. It's not hard to notice that Van Halen 3 or Gary Cherone are not even mentioned on the discography or the bio. And for me to include the three live tracks was unnecesary. I know it is imposible to include all the great songs in a compilation, but any VH fan will miss Cabo Wabo.<br /><br />But even if you are a VH fan or not you will remember many if not everyone of the songs in this compilation and how great they still sound. So ignore the bad reviews, this is a must buy. You Will Enjoy It.<br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />I don't understand all the bad reviews, all the VH albums with Roth were great. Van Halen I & 1984 are Classics. But remember David Lee Roth left the band \\"20 YEARS AGO\\" and the only reason we remember him now is because of Van Halen. I'm amazed of how many fans Roth still has, but you never hear anything about his solo career. Roth's career never left the 80's and the band made the right decision replacing him with Hagar. That's why they still playing and recording today with Sammy, and not another 80's band who was forgotten.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I netflixed this one last week after a friends comments about getting her Firth-Fix from watching it. It's a delightful film - although I think they could have definitely cut some of the storylines (oh I don't know - maybe the nude movie stand-ins ... that just seemed like a bit too much gratuitous nudity for my taste).<br /><br />Laura Linney's storyline was heart-breaking ... but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel about it at the end of the movie? Are we supposed to be ok with her giving up any semblance of a normal life to be at the beck and call of her mentally unstable brother? I don't think it's selfish or heartless to think that you can care for your family, and still have other people in your life.<br /><br />Colin Firth was his normal cute self ... his hilariously worded Portuguese proposal was a high-point in the film.<br /><br />:::: \\"Beautiful Aurelia, I've come here with a view of asking you to marriage me. I know I seems an insane person - because I hardly knows you - but sometimes things are so transparency, they don't need evidential proof. And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England.\\" ::::<br /><br />Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister? You mean he isn't portraying a cad? The U.S. President, on the other hand, is portrayed as a total cad.<br /><br />Emma Thompson remains one of the most talented actresses ... she was amazing in the role of the wife of a cheating husband. Her confrontation with Harry at the school play was ... perfectly executed.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson wrapping the jewelry ... and holding up the airline security for Liam Neeson's son to sneak through ... great casting!<br /><br />I liked how the movie began with Hugh Grant's voice-over about seeing love everywhere ... especially at the arrivals gate at Heathrow. The movie ending in the same place was just bringing the circle around to a nice ending.<br /><br />:::: \\"Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think of the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the twin towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. And if you look for it, I've got a sneaking suspicion that love actually is all around.\\" ::::als gate at Heathrow Airport.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|There isn't much to fix if a product ain't broke, specially when it comes to Megadeth forth and arguably best album \\"RIP\\". <br />The album was, is, and will always be one of Thrash Metal's cornerstone.  <br />Fast, driving, distorted and amazing riffs, backed up by great bass lines and aggressive, killer beats is a combination hard to beat. Add on that Dave's passionate vocals and intelligent lyrics and you have the masterpiece we all loved. <br />Trully there is little if any room for change. Well, I beleive that Dave made something good even better with this remix. The tracks by all instruments are VERY MUCH clearer. The reverb has being taken out and the re-recording makes it easier to listen to each instrument on it's own. As a whole the music is just as aggressive, heavy, and full of energy as before. <br />The other difference is that Dave re-recorded his vocals. Again, the drowning reverb was taken off. Other than that the only difference that you could tell are the back vocals in most of the songs, they just sound in a slightly different scale. <br />The record definitely gained on this remix on it's weakest spot (production), now sounding digital and more \\"modern\\". If you like it or not is a matter of taste, that it sounds better is a matter of fact. Is it worth $15??? if you didn't had the original, bring your credit card right now and do yourself a favor. If you did, well, new tracks and a new better sleeve might sell it for you. <br />Highlights: Holy Wards, Hangar 18 <br />Lowlights: pointless if you already owned it.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Watched this on the recommendation of a friend -- and I liked it! Ala Quentin Tarantino - it's super violent - but it's cartoonish violence. Someone's arm gets cut of ... and it spews like a geiser. It's gross but funny at the same time. Some the scenes actually ARE cartoons. You aren't horrified. It's like ... Monty Python meets all the Samurai movies you've ever seen.<br /><br />Uma, co-creator of these movies, is perfect as The Bride. Love the yello track suit, an homage to Bruce Lee. Lucy Lui - somehow this reminded me of her Ally McBeal days? Perhaps its the quietly lethal air she has about her!<br /><br />(some of the trivia tidbits about the conception and filming of this movie are really interesting - amazon has a compilation of much of them in the DVD listing)<br /><br />Kill Bill Vol. 2 has already been added to the netflix queue. (Where we finally get to see David Carradine!)
B0002EXH4A|5.0|So Far, So Good, So What! is a metal masterpiece. I was always turned off to listening to it due to the VERY annoying reverb and phaser effect that was on the recording of the album. This album DOES benefit LOTS on this remaster and re-recording. <br /> <br />SFSGSW is Megadeth's third effort after the great Peace Sells. Songs like \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" and \\"Set the World Afire\\" are fast, aggressive and skillfull. Others are catchy like \\"Anarchy in the USA\\" and specially \\"Hook in Mouth\\", while others are riff-masterpieces like \\"Mary Jane\\", \\"Liar\\" and \\"502\\".  <br /> <br />Sadly the effect of the album recording KILLED the original. Now with the re-recording, all guitar solos and riffs, bass lines, and vocals sound amazingly cristal clear, making all of the above shine on their own, and bring a strong thrashy aggressive effect as a whole and all together, still being by far better sounding than the original with it's new digitalization and re-mixing. <br /> <br />If there was any Megadeth album that needed a re-do and a total re-production, this one was it. This is the one I really suggest buying even if you own the original one. This is the one that you definitely find worth the money for a new one.  <br /> <br />There are no unreleased songs other than other remixes, but the masterpiece discovered behind all that bad production of the original is definitely worth it. After one spin, it will easily become NOW a favorite. <br /> <br />Highlights: Into the Lungs of Hell <br />Lowlights: no unreleased new tracks?
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I am by no means a huge Slipknot fan, but I listen to just about any music.  Slipknot's past work has been good, but not very dynamic.  Every song was a blowout, which is not always a bad thing.  There comes a time in every band's career where they have to sit down and figure out exactly where they want to go with their music.  What Slipknot is doing is nothing you can call selling out because there are still many songs on this album way to hard and outside the mainstream to go anywhere near daytime radio.  The album is a balanced attack of hard, slightly (and I emphasize slightly) radio-friendly songs, all out thrash rockers, and acoustic songs that still manage to sound justifiably outside-the-norm in their own right.  This band has matured greatly.  The only disaster I can forsee is if their next album is just a mess of singles they want to release.  This is one of the few cohesive albums that has been released this year and I hope they can continue to create well-balanced albums like this in the future.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|When I heard that Dave Mustaine wanted to remaster and re-record most of the parts on all the Megadeth Catalog, I always wondered if there was much to change in this album. As I heard I found out that there wasn't much to do. <br />While most of the other albums, specially the ones before this one, got the loads of reverb taken off, this album actually went almost the other way. The sound is almost slightly thicker. The guitars are slightly more \\"bass-y\\", the bass is very slighly more predominant than the original and the vocals sound more mature. <br />Still with great thrash moments (as in Ashes in Your Mouth), aggressive musical attacks (Symphony of Destruction), and driving songs (Skin Of My Teeth), the sound is very hardly different from the original. The album still features beautyfull guitar moments (Countdown to Extintion, Foreclousure of a Dream).  <br />Since this album was digital to start with the changes are not as easy to notice as in \\"So Far, So good... So What\\" per say. Still the little changes make the record better sounding, now is it worth the money? if you have the original, I don't see why spending $15 on something so damn similar.  <br />The extra tracks help, they are fine, the new sleves and notes are interesting, but I still don't think that they are worth $15, buy it used. <br /> <br />Highlights: Ashes in your Mouth, Countdown to Extintion <br />Lowlights: not worth it if you own the original.
B000001E18|2.0|That is probably what Bono said when he released this album.  I mean come on, full songs in falsetto?  That isn't U2.  There's a reason fans go back for more and more fo this awesome band, and it's not for a different sound.  The only exception in this album is Stay, an excellent song that at least shows a hint that the good old U2 is still alive, although not thriving.  If you are a fan of synthesizers and techno beats, this album is for you.  Unfortunatly, Bono was 10 years too late in realizing when this stuff was really popular.  Conversely, had this album been released 10 years earlier, their career may have been ruined, seeing as they were busy creating excellent albums in the 80s like War, The Unforgettable Fire, and The Joshua Tree.  Obviously, whenever you get a U2 album, you will have powerful vocals, an excellent guitar, and a steady percussion beat.  Unfortunately the synthesizers and techno beats are too loud to even hear The Edge belt out some great sounds.  Some feel this is U2's best work while many others feel it is their worst.  Only a band like U2 could have such contrast in how well recieved an album is.  Again, if you are looking for a U2 album with the same qualities as their previous albums, I suggest you stray from Zooropa.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Peace Sells but Who's buying is definitely a great thrash masterpiece that deserved a remaster. <br /> <br />The thunderous guitar riffs are a lot clearer now. They still sound fast, distorted and feroucious. The drums also are more clear now that all the reverb from the guitars has being taken off, still fast (as on The Conjouring), aggressive (Wake up Dead) and very driving (My Last Words). David's bass lines sound a lot more prominent and reverb-less also (check the song Peace Sells), maybe it's the instrument that sounds the best after the remaster compared to the original. Mustaine also re-recorded new vocal tracks on all the songs which makes sound better in the sense that first of all they are not sunk in reverb, and second the slight diferences offer a more mature Dave Mustaine as a singer (Devil's Island as an example), yet still as angry and pissed as he was 20 years ago, and the recording can show. <br /> <br />In general the sound is more clear, and more \\"digital\\" per say. These can be considered a good thing or a bad thing depending on where you stand. In my honest opinion the tracks sound A LOT better. Yet i believe that this remaster is not worth buying if you already own the original records. It's a good thing and I am glad to be able to listen to my old favorites (this is my favorite Megadeth album) finally sounding as they should. <br /> <br />Highlights: Wake Up Dead, My last Words <br />Lowlights: not worth the money if you own the original.
B00000IMCZ|5.0|This is the most important propaganda work of the Third Reich.  Made by reknowned filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, it documented the Fuehrer's grand vision for all to see.<br /><br />Should the program of the NSDAP and Third Reich been successful, the most important language in the world would be German, and beer would be our national drink.<br /><br />The late Ms. Riefenstahl was a masterful filmmaker, and this film was unfortunately her best-known work.  As a work of propaganda, it should be studied.  Its cautious dictum is that one should be careful about the causes one promotes. The Propaganda Ministry under Dr. Goebbels was excellent at its activities, largely keeping the German people clueless about the tragedies that would overcome their lives until the RAF and USAAF bombers were heard crossing the Belgian, Dutch and French borders, and the North Sea.<br /><br />Could a film such as this have such an effect today?  That is a question worth considering--has the nature of propaganda changed?
B000002L5P|5.0|When guitarist Johnny Marr was seeking a lyricist in the spring of 1982, little did he know that the band he would be forming would be a huge influence on the British rock scene for the years to come. Stephen Patrick Morrissey (who unsuccessfully auditioned with the lead singing role with local Manchester bands, as well as being the president of the U.K. New York Dolls fanclub) gladly accepted Marr's invitation and soon the pair began writing songs together, with the first being \\"Suffer Little Children\\". After recording demo's with The Fall's drummer, Simon Wolstencroft, Marr decided to recruit schoolmates Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce as the bassist and drummer, hencing a band that would be known as \\"The Smiths\\".  <br /> <br />The Smiths began working on their eponymous debut album in the months that followed, and released it entitled \\"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle\\" (which was on a low budget) with producer Troy Tate. The band was not happy with the production of the album, and immediately got John Porter to produce it. Not long after, the band's debut album, \\"The Smiths\\", was finished.  <br /> <br />A surprisingly very good debut album, it proved just how much The Smiths were willing to go in the music industry. From their first single, \\"Hand In Glove\\", to \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves\\", all the way up to \\"I Don't Owe You Anything\\", every track on this album will not disappoint.  <br /> <br />1. Reel Around The Fountain: The opening track of The Smiths, this five-minute song proves that the band were willing enough to explore all directions. The keyboards and organ flow well with the song, which is about nothing less than sexual desire. <br /> <br />2. You've Got Everything Now: A much faster song than the slow opener, this is one of those songs that you can play over and over. This song explains the story of a failed life. <br /> <br />3. Miserable Lie: The most rocking song of the album will have you jumping up out of your seat if your not careful. The song is about love, with it simply being a miserable lie (and you're find out why).  <br /> <br />4. Pretty Girls Make Graves: One of the best songs of the album comes into play early. The slower song explains to us about a relationship gone wrong, with the words \\"I'm not the man you think I am\\". <br /> <br />5. The Hand That Rocks The Cradle: A very good song follows the previous hopeless tune. This song is usually slated to be about child abuse, but singer Morrissey doesn't necessarily agree. Judge for yourself. <br /> <br />6. This Charming Man: An upbeat song proves that this was the right choice for the second single. A favorite for the critics' to question Morrisey, it is about a decision for the man over his love options. <br /> <br />7. Still Ill: A surely unforgettable song, Morrissey's crooning voice and saddened lyrics fit in perfectly with the tune. It is reflecting about enjoyable times which is now long gone. <br /> <br />8. Hand In Glove: This song will prove to you why The Smiths were such a influential band. The band's first single is a fast paced song full of controversy. It is about homosexuality. <br /> <br />9. What Difference Does It Make?: The Smiths continue to hand us great songs again and again. The third single will surely attach to you. <br /> <br />10. I Don't Owe You Anything: Probably the weakest song of the album, but nevertheless very good. It is about a daily chat while appearing to be drunk. <br /> <br />11. Suffer Little Children: This closing song is about the Moors Murders, an event during the 1960's in which several children were abducted and killed in Manchester. The haunting lyrics will clearly leave an impression on the listener. <br /> <br />Overall, a surprisingly very good debut album. It took a while before The Smiths found their sound, but this album is truly a must have. With songs like \\"Hand In Glove\\", \\"This Charming Man\\", and \\"Suffer Little Children\\", among the other greats on this album, I highly recommend this album, especially to first time listeners. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|If you speak English and like DVD format, this is THE definitive version of Das Boot to see.<br /><br />The clarity of the format visually is excellent, the German is unbelievably clear.  Here you'll see all of the parts that really should have been included in versions more accessible to Americans, that should NEVER have been cut out to make it \\"feature length.\\"<br /><br />The impact is even greater, the humanity the bonded the 50-odd sailors into the iron coffins of the U-Boot Waffe is palpable.  While the differences are subtle, they are most dramatic...including the rendezvous of the Matrose with his pregnant French girlfriend, or the few minutes of detail left out when the Kaleun (Kapit&auml;nleutnant), LI (Leutnantingeneur), and Leutnant Werner (Marinekriegsberichter--reporter) take a stroll in La Spezia and the Captain informs these two they will not be going ashore...those few minutes show why J&uuml;rgen Prochnow IS a great actor.<br /><br />All in all--the version to buy and to view more than once.  Unless, of course, you speak German and can watch the German unedited version.  Prost!
B0001AP12G|1.0|To be truthfully honest, this album sucks. This isnt real hip-hop this is like everything else out today... hip-POP. Wow he may talk about different things in his lyrics, but its still the same concept as everything else out today. The only song i really like is \\"through the wire.\\" The song \\"jesus walks\\" may get alot of praise and positive reviews, but the song is really anoyying. It has yet to grow on me and probably never will. The rest of the songs suck pretty much. If i could get a refund id do it in a second. This is pure trash and whoever said this album in a few years will be looked back on and be considered a classic and be compared to the likes of \\"sraight outta compton\\" \\"the chronic\\" and \\"all eyez on me\\" just has issues. I mean were you stoned when you wrote your review because this album will never be considered a classic, and should not and will hopefully never be mentioned again in the same sentence as those cds. People these days... i tell ya... they dont know what real hip-hop is. I hate the way the rap game has just totally turned pop. All these stupid hip-POP artists are getting attention while the real hip-hop artists are gettin no recognition and no credit what so ever. Dont buy this garbage, or do if you feel like, but i gaurentee you that you will be wasting your hard earned money.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I think the best comparison I can make regarding Moore is that he is a magician. Magicians achieve their goal through diversion. Instead of a stage and disappearing (attractive) lady assistants, Moore is a magician whose medium is film and politics. And like most magicians, Moore puts on an entertaining show. <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11, the latest in Micheal Moore's successful line of \\"documentary\\" films, is cunningly edited. I give it two stars for that. Unfortunately, I have to with-hold the other three because it's masquerading as something it's not; a documentary. Moore's trademarks are his crafty editing to lead the viewers to the wrong conclusions and \\"facts\\" without context. <br /> <br />It starts right away, when in the beginning of the film, Moore makes it seem that FOX News called Florida for Bush when all of the other networks were calling for Gore. In reality, FOX called Florida for Gore just minutes after NBC and CBS did. When it was realized that the vote was too close to call, CBS and CNN retracted their call for Gore at 10:00PM. FOX retracted their call for Gore four hours later, at 2:00AM. It's obvious that Moore was trying to tap into the perception that FOX News is partial to President Bush. <br /> <br />A bit later, Moore insinuates that President Bush had not read the security briefing on August 6, 2001, which contained information that Osama Bin Laden planned to attack America by hijacking planes, because the title was vague. He then shows a video clip of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice announcing the title of the briefing as \\"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US.\\" Only Moore claims that Pres. Bush did not read the briefing. Further, Moore doesn't show the viewer that the briefing's *contents* were vague. It did not say that Bin Laden was seeking to hijack aircraft for attacks, but instead to use the hijackings to demand the release of US held associates of Bin Laden. The briefing did not specify what kind of attacks Bin Laden wasplanning, just that the planning was taking place. <br /> <br />One of his facts without context in the film is the segment on the Saudis, including members of the Bin Laden family, who were flown out of the US. Moore creates the impression that they were flown out with special treatment on orders from the White House while all other flights were still grounded. In fact, all of the Saudi flights took place after airspace was reopened. Also, the 9/11 Commission found that each flight was properly scrutinized by authorities (including the FBI) before they departed. There was nothing sinister about these flights, no matter how hard Moore tries to imply otherwise. <br /> <br />In all, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an entertaining film. However, Moore cannot be taken seriously as an arbiter of truth. He arranges and manipulates video clips, newspaper headlines, and commentary to lead the viewer to false conclusions which support his political worldview. What you see is not what you get.
1577311523|5.0|This is one of the most interesting, captivating books I've EVER read.  While reading, I felt something inside me literally light up and radiate throughout my entire being.  It was like my spirit was not just nodding and smiling but speaking, \\"Finally, she's reading this. Yes!\\" I trust my instincts and immediately I knew that there was truth and wisdom here to find and apply to my life for Good.  Numerous times while reading, I paused and pondered in a meditative manner to allow this familiar knowledge to sink deep inside me.  I wished it to stay with me forever.  And it has.  THE POWER OF NOW is a book I believe everyone in this fast-paced, stressed-out world should not only read but add to their library.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Some quotes I wish to remember and share:<br /><br />\\"In essence there is and always has been only ONE spiritual teaching, although it comes in many forms.\\"<br /><br />\\"When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally.\\"<br /><br />\\"...You are not the possessing entity--the thinker.  Knowing this enables you to observe the entity.  The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of conciousness becomes activated...when you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially...the thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides.\\"<br /><br />\\"Enlightenment means rising above thought...all true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness.  The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or insight.  Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude.\\"<br /><br />\\"An emotion has an overpowering electric charge.  It wants to take you over and it usually succeeds--unless there is enough presence in you.  Emotion literally means 'disturbance'.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you are able to stay alert and present at that time and watch whatever you feel within rather than being taken over by it, it affords opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all past pain becomes possible.\\"<br /><br />\\"As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease.  When you act out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love--even the most simple action.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wherever you are, be there totally.\\"<br /><br />\\"Surrender is not weakness; there is great strength in it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Die to the past every moment.  You don't need it.\\"<br /><br />\\"True love has no opposite because it arises from beyond the mind.\\"<br /><br />Important note: Please don't take my choice of quotes as an overview of the book and base your decision on buying because of these.

192076920X|5.0|There's no doubt about it - Shantaram is a great read. Roberts weaves personal insight with a tale of high adventure while on the run from the law that is at times profound, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and always a ripping good read. The semi-fictional events in this book are based on the author's true life experiences while on the run from the Australian authorities for a string of armed bank robberies. Roberts flees to Mumbai, India, where he joins the local Bombay mafia, falls in love, smuggles arms and contraband to Afghanistan, sets up a medical clinic, and discoveres his true identity in a sort of middle-life coming-of-age tale. Above all, Shantaram is a great read and can be read as a thriller, a travel adventure, a love story and a philosophical journey; this book had me turning the pages until the early morning hours. Enjoy.
B000002L5P|5.0|This is my first review so I'll just say my favorite songs on the album... <br /> <br />Reel Around the Fountain <br />This Charming Man <br />Still Ill <br />Hand In Glove <br />What Difference Does it Make <br /> <br />buy this album!! and read Moz Marr Smith's review to convince you cause it kicks ass....oo matt thanks for the title! hah <br />
B00005JL3A|2.0|The movie is sort of a crossover between the genres of zombies [a la Night of the Living Dead] and artificial intelligence gone wrong [in the mode of one of the less good early X-files episodes]. The result is a mediocre horror flick, with a story not convincing enough and character development far from sophisticated enough for the movie to be even slightly memorable. <br /> <br />The atmosphere is clinical, very much reminiscent of Event Horizon, another movie made by the same director Paul Anderson, only that Event Horizon is a slightly more interesting movie. The movie's sterilized feel is almost devoid of human emotions, even in the one or two forced scenes where the characters are supposed to express sympathy and compassion. Those scenes are ineffective. It feels like the script writers feel compelled to include them only to make sure the audience can distinguish the otherwise cold and expressionless human characters from the zombies and artificial intelligence. The stubborn refusal to develop the characters in any three-dimensional sense is rather annoying. <br /> <br />Even if one treats it as a ride in an amusement park, the movie fails to really deliver. The zombie attacks are clichd, and you could feel that even the cast sometimes shows in the movie their own lack of interests. Humor, in any form, is also conspicuously missing in the movie. Overall, no matter what you are looking for, I would not recommend this movie.  <br />
B000002UUX|5.0|Think you know your licks? Think you can melt your strings with a frenzied solo? Can you make your guitar beg for mercy? If so then you certainly can appreciate Megadeth's Rust in Peace. For guitar players at any and all levels, this CD should be ranked with Van Halen's 1st album as inspirational.<br /><br />I like Megadeth, I always did. This was their 4th album with their 3rd lineup. Maybe third time is the charm. Though I really missed Cris Poland since Peace, Marty had a stake to claim in the Megadeth realm. Sure his hair looked ridiculous, but his paying ability shut you up quick.<br /><br />From Rust's opening, you are taken on a roller coaster ride and you better hang on. Holy Wars...the Punishment Due ain't your be-bop hair metal, this is a thrash album from beginning to end. With songs like 'Take no Prisoners', 'Rust in Peace Solaris', 'Tornado of Souls' and of course 'Hanger 18', it was clear Megadeth was on solid ground and out to conquer the speed/thrash metal arena. I believe Rust in Peace was Megadeth's highest point.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer. The most talented people to ever play in Metallica were CLiff Burton and Dave Mustaine.
B0002234LS|3.0|To start, this movie has a somewhat stupid plot, revolving around an insane southerner trying to murder Johnny Depp's character on accusations of plagiarism. And, although we all know Johnny Depp as the strange and humorous Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, he is NOT supposed to be strange and humorous!!! Ok, maybe strange, but NOT humorous! It's entertaining seeing Johnny Depp acting like a weirdo, but this is SUPPOSED to be a suspense movie! This movie has more of a comedy element thanks to Johnny Depp's little quirks than it does a suspense element. Also, the characters don't seem very developed. They all seem to have dry, dull personalities. The only character in the movie whose personality isn't typical for the kind of person he plays is Johnny Depp. Other than that, you've got the hot-headed boyfriend who feels like Johnny Depp's being too surly about his and Johnny's (soon to be) ex-wife's affair, you have the adultering wife of Johnny Depp who calls him every now and then and tries to make friendly conversation with him, and you've got the detective who doesn't speak more than 7 or 8 sentences per dialogue. This movie has a VERY disappointing twist at the end. It's almost so bad that you don't like it. Anyways, if you're looking for a suspense that'll have you on the edge of your seat, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a shallow, yet somewhat entertaining film, then give this a try. The only people who I would recommend this to are those bizarre cultists who loyally follow and worship Johnny Depp...like my mom. ::gags::
B000001GPX|2.0|if this is the greatest classical recording/performance of all time - as seems to be the general consensus - then shouldn't the tympani sound a bit more like tympani and rather less like someone banging a door with a mallet?  The kettle drum sound is appalling throughout,which might matter a little less if they weren't so ludicrously prominent in the mix or if their owner didn't seem to have had, at times, only an approximate idea of when his job description required him to hit the things.  I take it this is the same player who marred some of the Maazel/VPO Sibelius cycle some years earlier?  Either way it sounds like he's building a shed.    Indeed the sound quality as a whole is nothing to write home about.  In common with most other '70s DG recordings I've heard, it's poorly balanced, cluttered, shrill and fizzy.      The performance?  Well, the first movement of the 5th is certainly \\"urgent\\", and as such it undeniably imparts a certain visceral thrill. The corollary of this approach, however, is that the beauty, poetry, and gravitas so essential to this movement are almost completely absent.  To me it mostly sounds clipped and rushed.  I'm sorry, perhaps it's me but I just don't get it. Give me Karajan's '77 BPO 5th any day.    Generally the two slow movements work best here.  Neither of them receive particularly affecting performances but at least the tympani are largely absent and the recording equipment is able to cope with the quieter sonics.    The Beethoven recording to end them all?  As Ludwig himself might have said: \\"Eh?\\"
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is, without a doubt, my favorite of Tim Burton's work. Some guys might say this is a girly movie because it has a romance element in it. However, this movie is incredibly imaginative and combines great storytelling with amazing effects and characters that feel as real as they appear in the film. The story is about a young man played by Billy Crudup who goes to visit his father after hearing he is severely ill. He wants to know who his father really was, not just the stories he was told growing up, which, although fascinating to everyone else, he is tired of hearing. This film dives into every story Billy Crudup's father has to tell, changing scenery and characters enough that it seems like a variety show. This movie has a little bit of everything. It has action, drama, romance, and humor. It's an awesome movie for anyone with a colorful imagination. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to sit down, listen to stories and picture them in their heads. Definitely a family film.
B000089CJI|5.0|This a great album combining an electronic artist's beats and synthesizers with an indie rocker's guitars, vocals, and lyrics. The album was named after the duo's means of communication; The Postal Service. You should really check them out
B000002UAU|2.0|It's a bit funny how people still rave about one of the weakest pop albums ever released, after almost 40 years. To tell the truth, there are only 2 (yes, TWO) stand-out tracks on this record, out of 13 (She's Leaving Home and ADITL - they're not very original, clearly stolen from Brian Wilson, but still quite pleasant), all the others are nothing more than pale imitations of REALLY groundbreaking and amazing productions of the era (yes, Pet Sounds, yes, Freak Out). Lennon and McCartney are often praised as genius songwriters, but I don't think they were more talented than, say, those guys from Herman's Hermits. I mean, you smoke a lot of dope and bring in a 40 piece orchestra to the studio and then you automatically become a genius? NO. You have to write great songs too, pal. And these guys had totally forgotten to write good songs after about 1964. Ignore this overrated crpap, and go and buy Odessey and Oracle or Younger Then Yesterday if you want to hear the real sound and magic of 1967.
B000001E29|1.0|After reading all the glowing reviews for this CD, I felt that I had to provide at least a partial rebuttal.  First, let me say that I've been a T.W. fan for over 25 years, through all his iterations.  He is, quite simply, one of my favorite artists.  That said, this is the only Waits CD I can't relate to AT ALL.  I must have listened to this thing at least 20 times over a two year period before finally giving up selling it.  This is the only Waits I've ever parted with.  If you like his \\"post-Swordfish\\" style, try \\"Rain Dogs\\", \\"Bone Machine\\", \\"Blood Money, or \\"Alice\\" - damn near anything but this (even \\"Mule Variations\\", if you must).  If you love Waits, you'll probably have to try this (like I did), but consider yourself warned.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Better than I thought it would be. I passed this movie by at the video store for months, assuming it was probably just another romantic comedy, but perhaps far worse than average. Finally, at a loss for something to watch, I rented it, figuring my wife might like it and it might balance out all the action movies I rent that she hates.<br /><br />While not a great movie, it does pretend to some substance. Julia Roberts is fun to watch in almost anything, despite my sometimes attempts to avoid her. Kirsten Dunst was more or less wasted in this film (in terms of herâ~hotnessâ), which is a shame. It is aâ~one woman against the establishmentâ film, and not Robertâs best effort, but I fell into the groove pretty easily and donât feel all the negative reviews are justified. It is just a formula movie, but the formula is not one that is really objectionable.<br /><br />-- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)
B0001NBMBC|5.0|What I found so interesting about this cd was how different it was from their previous work--yes, it still involves the screaming, but to a lesser extent; I think that the success of Stone Sour may have had some influence on how Corey and his fellow bandmates decided to take this album, because you can definitely see that they've grown with each release.  And no that's NOT selling out, it's called reinventing and in Slipknot's case it's a great thing.
038551123X|4.0|This isn't a GREAT book, but it is an enjoyable, quick read. <br /> <br />I felt cheated by the revelation of the identity of the serial killer Dexter is chasing.  I don't think there was any way for the reader to have figured it out, and that always annoys me.  On top of that, the resolution just seemed pretty implausible. <br /> <br />Oh well.  I'll definitely read another installment in this series.

0385512104|4.0|When I picked this book up, I was really afraid that I had bought a cheesy piece of fluff.  It was on the Today show list and, lets face it, that does not say much for a book.  Imagine my surprise when the author was able to circumnavigate all the Hallmark greeting card traps and produce a very able novel.  The narrative structure did not fall apart and the main character kept his voice.  Not a classic but entertaining. Overall, a pleasant and quick read.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD called College Dropout by Chi-town native Kayne West is off tha chain man. We Don't Dare is awesome School Spirit is off and as a Greek I feel that song tha most.

B0001I55OC|3.0|OK, I passed this by for many weeks, my sixth sense warning me that this was probably not worth the time and money. Then, in a pinch to watch something, I rented it. What it is:<br /><br />Straight-ahead science fiction, poorly done, but watch able. It is short on the science and long on the fiction. I concede all the negative points others have indicated, but I managed to watch it anyway, without too much suffering. It has a couple of love stories that turn out well. The segueing from past to present pretty much was shabby and the movie is more centered in France in the 1300s than in the present. I did not mind the battle scenes and it was interesting to see the English as the bad guys for a change. I thought the ferocity of the English was fascinating. The fact is that I managed to get in the groove of it and forgot about its weak points, for the most part. While I would not seek it out again, I am not sorry to have seen it.<br /><br />-- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)
0451527046|4.0|I recently read Treasure Island again and really enjoyed it. It has been at least 20 years since I last read it, and I had forgotten nearly everything. So much happens in this story it is hard to believe it! There is danger lurking around every corner, and the pirate-speak dialogue is a lot of fun.
B00000JCOV|2.0|I would say that the band ripped the mask gimmick off of GWAR, but since allmusic lists Faith No More and Mr. Bungle as influences, it seems obvious that the stole it from Mr. Bungle. For those not familiar with the bands, GWAR was a comedy group that came out in the early '90's. They had masks that were very similar to the ones SP wear. <br /> <br />Anyway, for those that haven't heard Slipknot's first album, \\"Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat\\", it's a complete rip-off of Mr. Bungle. Mr. Bungle was an experimental rock group that would sometimes mix heavy metal, death metal, thrash metal, alternative metal, Beach Boys-type pop, techno, and skaa into their music. Slipknot tried to do that with MFKR, but failed miserably at it.  <br /> <br />At least Mr. Bungle had a reason for wearing the masks (They didn't want people knowing that Mike Patton was in the band, but after everyone found out, they stopped wearing them). Slipknot, on the other hand, have one of the worst reasons I've ever heard for wearing their masks: They claim that they're actually telling us more about themselves by wearing the masks than by showing their faces. What a lame excuse. The masks are used as a gimmick, and they even make a big deal about it when they change the things. <br /> <br />I'll admit that Corey is a good vocalist and Joey is a good drummer, but the rest of the band is terrible. They all play very sloppily and, hoping that no one notices, play as loud as they can to try to cover up their lack of talent. I wouldn't even hate them as much as I do if it weren't for their fans - ignorant teens who listen to the band because they think it makes them 'tough' or 'cool' (basically, they're the same as the worst kind of fans ever: Juggalos). Also of note is the fact that they'll insult anyone who hates the band, showing that they can't handle others opinions. While I admit that some of their fans aren't like that and just listen to it because they enjoy it, most of these \\"maggots\\" are. Chances are, any metal band that has a DJ in the group or comes up with a name for their fans are going to suck. How ironic that real-life maggots are insects that fester around feces.

B00005Q66Y|5.0|I have always admired Gunter Wand.  From his Beethoven Cycle to his awe inspiring interpretation of the last two Schubert symphonies, Wand is a master conductor.  But this live recording of Anton Bruckner's great 8th symphony is quite possibly his greatest achievement.  Never has this symphony sounded so perfect, so architecturally sound, so convincingly played.  For those that admire the overrated Karajan/Wiener Philharmoniker, they need to listen to this amazing recording.  It is Wand's genius that drives this great work - he is so deeply steeped in the german master.      From the beginning of the opening allegro, the upcoming excitement is palpable.  The opening theme, rhythmically identical to the opening theme of Beethoven's ninth, unfolds mystically.  Climaxes build with chilling precision.  This is the only outer movement of a Bruckner symphony to begin and end quietly, but the effect is striking when the strings dip into nothingness, fragmenting the movement's main theme.  The Scherzo is amazingly conducted and performed.  The playing by both the winds as well as the timpani make this reading of the Scherzo so fascinating.  Wand's tempo is swift but uncompromising.  The sublime trio is equally powerful.  However, it is in the Adagio that Gunter Wand and the Philharmonic truly shine.  The string section of the Philharmonic has never sounded so pure, so rich, so beautiful - even under Karajan they never reached this level of perfection.  Wand's reading of the adagio is inspired; his juxtaposition of the two themes is masterful.  The finale is equally masterful.  More powerfully executed than any other recording I have heard, the finale is the perfect apotheosis of structure, form, and musical vision.  Wand is unfailing in his dedication to detail - every note is in its proper place, building for the listener the architecture that is Bruckner's symphonic world.  With the awe-inspiring coda, Bruckner concludes this masterwork by combining all four main themes of the symphony, thus, in a way, integrating the symphony in a way not heard of since Beethoven's Ninth.    I honestly cannot say more than get this CD as quickly as you can.  You won't be disappointed.  It's quite possibly the best CD in my collection.
B000002IG4|5.0|Phil Collins' second solo album \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\" is a highly personal album.   Just about every song on the collection centers around relationships and most of it around the breakup of his marriage to his first wife Andrea.   It had been reported that Andrea ran out on Phil, who had long been entrenched in his career.   In a lot of ways, this album is a continuation from his first solo album \\"Face Value\\".   On \\"Face Value\\" a lot of what was written on the hit song \\"In the Air Tonight\\"  was his bitterness toward his first wife.   On \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\", Phil expands on the theme of the breakup - but not just with the bitterness.  Phil gives his own perspectives on things and also will acknowledge his own faults.   On the \\"Face Value\\" album, there are three central themes that are also carried out to \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\":  1) He continues to integrate horns into the songs (although a little less on this album);  2) There still what I term a \\"dark psychedelic\\" element.    The best way I can describe this is this is the kind of music you might hear on a quiet, dark city street - with a touch of psychedelica; 3) The Thundering, Haunting Drums of Phil Collins continue.    With the \\"Hello\\" album, Phil also introduces a fourth element - the use of keyboards and pianos.   This gives \\"Hello\\" a more of a mainstream pop element.  Don't let that deter you, this is one terrific album and it shows that Collins had the confidence to grow his solo career while still being an integral part of Genesis. <br /> <br />The titles of the songs really tell a lot of the story of Phil's feelings about the breakup.   \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" is one of those songs with the dark psychedelic element\\" and Phil's haunting drums.  Lines such as \\"Get out of my way, let me by, I got better things to do with my time\\" tell the story.    Another song with that dark psychedelic element and haunting drums is \\"Do You Know, Do You Care?\\".  This song has some trumpet in it.  Again the references to the relationship are pretty clear - especially when he says \\"I'm sick of all the cheating\\".  The song,  \\"Thru These Walls\\" also falls into the same category.  In this song, Phil sings about his feelings on what is going on with his estranged wife and her lover.  A mellower song is \\"Why Can't It Wait Til Morning\\"- which can be interpreted different ways.  Is this a song about Phil possibly reflecting on what could have been with his relationship; or is this Phil's feelings to his new lover (soon to be second wife Jill), apologizing for the anger?   Finally, although not nearly a psychedelic song - but still with a bit of the \\"dark\\" side\\", \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\" is one of the better tracks on the album.   It basically is a message to his first wife as she is walking out the door on him.    It's a powerful message to her, but Phil acknowleges his own faults by saying \\"I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely.\\" <br /> <br />There are really three horn based songs.  One is a near instrumental called \\"The West Side\\".  Not really much in the way of vocals, but Phil does echo some \\"yeeaah\\" - sort of in the flavor of \\"Hand in Hand\\".   The song \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\" is probably one of the best songs on the album.   The horns add a great dimension to the song as Phil basically tells the story when his marriage broke up.   This song charted in the UK, but never hit in big in the U.S.   The third horn song \\"It Don't Matter to Me\\" was a B side to \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\", but could have easily been a released song on its own.  More ill feelings toward his first wife as Phil basically tells his wife now that they are done, \\"It Don't Matter\\" anymore to him. <br /> <br />The two \\"pop-like\\" songs that don't directly reference the breakup, but still fit into the theme nicely.  \\"Like China\\" is another song that is terrific.  This has a nice mix of keyboards and drums (both played by Phil thanks to the magic of mixing).    This could either bea song as he reflects on how he met his first wife (Andrea) or his second wife (Jill).  Phil's British accent is terrific in the song.    The remake of the Supremes' \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" reaffirms Phil's connection with Motown.   Although no horns, the mix of keyboards and drums once again makes this a very fun song that also discusses relationships.  The thing about \\"Like China\\" and \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" is we start to see the more humorous side of Phil Collins.  This is something that wasn't evident on \\"Face Value\\".   I believe this humor really provided a nice launching pad for what soon would be the peak period of his career.   The lightness of these two songs also add a nice other side to what could be considered an album that covers such a depressing theme as marriage breakup. <br /> <br />The version of this CD I have does not have the lyrics for the songs.  There are production and studio musician credits listed in the booklet.  Phil also gives a thank you to his second wife Jill \\"for putting up with it all\\".   In general, a disappointing thing is that (today) Phil Collins doesn't do much of the material from this album live - and that is a shame because this album really showcases Phil Collins at his best.   There isn't anything I would change about this album - it's a pure masterpiece both lyrically and musically and it is highly recommended!
1931788340|3.0|This was a book I purchased on a whim, mainly because the photographer Alec Soth considers this book to be a main influence in his work.  Stephen Shore's book depicts a somewhat hyper-reality in the places that people generally frequent.<br /><br />His low-contrast images are highly resolved and visually complex and the audience cannot help but stop and consider all the details packed into every frame.  We walk through these spaces every day, and take for granted the images that our eyes absorb.<br /><br />It is at this point where I begin to dislike these images.  Shore wants us to see through his eyes because he sees these spaces as extraordinary and beautiful whereas I see it as inane and depressing.  I see these spaces as nothing more than the throng of civilization casting aside its regard for natural beauty.  Glory is given to the street signs and the gas stations, to the sky-scrapers and the Volkswagens.  I cannot look at these images and see beauty.<br /><br />Whenever I drive down a highway I always imagine what it would look like without the buildings and roads and streetlights, and when I look at one of Shore's images I try to imagine what the landscapes would look like without us.  For me, this is the only successful function I can encounter.<br /><br />Carefully consider what your expectations of this book are before you buy it.  I believe that if you are interested in the ordinary and overlooked spaces that Shore has skillfully captured, this book is definitely your cup of tea.  However if you expect otherwise, you may end up coming to the same conclusion that I have.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|If you were a fan of the Twilight Zone (you know, the old black & white TV series) you should love The Butterfly Effect. Basically this guy Evan (Ashton Kutcher) discovers that every time he reads from journals that he wrote as a young boy he is teleported back to the exact moment that he is reading about with just enough time to \\"do something different\\" that \\"Effectively\\" has a dramatic \\"Effect\\" on the way his (and his friends') life ultimately turns out. I was thoroughly entertained. This is no teeny-bopper-Ashton-Kutcher-fan movie. It is well-acted, thrilling and suspenseful.
B00005N5S5|5.0|THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT MADE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER THE ICON HE IS TODAY. THIS 1984 CLASSIC IS ABOUT AN UNSTOPPABLE KILLER CYBORG FROM THE FUTURE [ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER] WHO TRAVELS BACK TO 1984 LOS ANGELES TO KILL AN INNOCENT WOMAN NAMED SARAH CONNOR [LINDA HAMILTON], LITTLE KNOWING THAT A MAN NAMED REESE [MICHAEL BIEHN] WAS SENT TO TRY AND PROTECT HER. THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIES EVER MADE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. THERE'S EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECTS, EXCELLENT ACTION SEQUENCES, AND EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. THIS CLASSIC IS SOMETIMES UNDERRATED IN COMPARISON TO ITS 1991 SEQUEL ''TERMINATOR 2; JUDGMENT DAY''. ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE NOWHERE NEAR AS HIGH TECH AS TERMINATOR 2 OR 3, THIS IS EASILY THE BEST OF THE 3. ONE HAS TO WONDER, WHY COULDN'T MICHAEL BIEHN GET ANYMORE HIGH PROFILE ROLES? HE DID SO GREAT IN THIS MOVIE. I ALMOST WISH HIS CHARACTER RETURNED FOR T2. IN MY BOOK, THIS IS A DEFINITE 5-STAR CLASSIC, THE SUCCESS OF THIS MOVIE INSPIRED MANY CLONES AND IMITATIONS, BUT NONE OF THEM EVEN COME CLOSE TO TOPPING THIS FANTASTIC MOVIE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS FILM TO ANY ACTION OR SCI-FI MOVIE BUFF. THE SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE ORIGINAL PREVIEW TRAILERS, TV SPOTS, DELETED SCENES, AND MORE. YA JUST CAN'T HATE THIS MOVIE.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|\\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" must be stopped.  I don't listen to modern rock radio.  But I still can't avoid hearing this song.  \\"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\\" is my all-time least favorite song, but this one isn't far behind.  Rather than annoying and self-indulgent, like \\"Dude,\\" \\"Girl\\" is blatantly unoriginal and deceptive.  I would argue that the song's deception, which is largely subjective, is its worst attribute.        You're in a public place...let's say, the gym.  You hearing the opening drum beat, and the bass line, and immediately look forward to hearing Iggy Pop's \\"Lust for Life.\\"  BUT THEN you shudder upon realizing, \\"No, this isn't 'Lust for Life.'  It's that stupid Jet song.  I'd better get out of here.\\"  So, while \\"Girl\\" provides an amazing excuse for curtailing a gym visit, it fools me every time.  I don't usually write scathing reviews on Amazon, but I had to get Jet back for tricking me so many times.      The long tradition of pop music copyright infringement includes George Harrison getting busted for stealing the melody of \\"He's So Fine\\" on his \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" and Vanilla Ice sneaking the instantly recognizable bass line from Bowie/Queen's \\"Under Pressure\\" smoothly into his \\"Ice Ice Baby.\\"  For some reason, Iggy Pop didn't go after Jet.  Maybe he doesn't feel like it.  Maybe he already has stock options in the song and is making a killing.  Maybe he's got a lazy lawyer.  Or perhaps, just perhaps, he doesn't believe that what Jet have done qualifies as copyright infringement.      Either way, no matter how much it tries to sound like \\"Lust for Life\\" in the beginning, \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" turns out to be a terrible song, with bland lyrics I could have written (only after writing the lyrics, I would have thrown them in the garbage.  They're that bad) and the chord structure featured in the children's book, My First Guitar.      The Marketing Hype is a monster with many heads to represent different gullible, ignorant target audiences. And watch out; it's at large once again.  Don't believe it.  Leave that to 13-year-olds.  They love this song - let them love it.  After all, I once thought \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" was pure originality.
0452270073|4.0|My sister loaned me this book, and I began it without any real idea of what it was about. Pat Barker has done a masterful job of creating interesting three-dimensional characters, some of whom are fictionalized from real life Britons who were caught up in the war. The steady plot never runs away from the characters, so this is not the book to read if one was expecting mindless action. <br /> <br />That being said, I found this a very interesting and easy read: one of those books that keeps you up too late trying to finish one more chapter. Although I'm not normally a fan of trilogies, this one is good enough to look forward to the remaining volumes. <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone interested in history, politics, and World War I.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|<br /> <br />I thought avril's first album was quite good, but I soon got bored of it, with this album it's totally different. This is one of my favorite albums, which is suprising because I was never that big a fan but I am now! In the booklet you get with the album there are lyrics and a small poster, all the songs are written by avril and the album lasts for 43 minutes,(with the bonus track.) There are rock tunes (with a little pop), but also ballads and a few mid-tempo tracks, so there's variety. Lots of people say this is like Let Go, I don't agree. I think there are a few tunes from here that might sound alike, like \\"fall to pieces,\\" \\"he wasn't\\" and \\"don't tell me,\\"  but it is much more mature. If you like any of her singles I'd recommend this. <br /> <br />Take Me Away - this is one of best on here, so a great beginning. This is one of the more rocky songs, a catchy chorus. This was my favourite on first listen.  9.5/10 <br /> <br />Together - a slower start, which then goes in to a rockin' chorus. My fave bit in this song is the pre chorus \\"when I'm alone I feel so much better and when I'm around you I don't feel...\\" This is definitely one of the best songs. 10/10 <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me - I think there are a lot of stronger songs on Under My Skin than this, which would be better as a first single, but it still is a good song. I'm sure you have your own judgement of this, so I won't go on. 8/10 <br /> <br />He Wasn't - about a boy who wasn't what she wanted and didn't give that much of a damn about her. Some people say this sounds like \\"Sk8er boi\\" the guitar tune is similar, but not much else. It sounds like it could have been on her last album, but is still a great anthem (well it's kind of an anthem.) 8.5/10 <br /> <br />How Does It Feel - This is a ballad, but not your average one, there is something new and different about it. The vocal here is good, also quite emotional. You can really get in to this and understand it what avril is talking about. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />My Happy Ending- I think this is the best single she has ever released, I really love this song, and even though it's getting played loads I still think it's great. It's just so damn catchy! 10/10 <br /> <br />Nobody's Home - This is my favourite track, it's a little sad, but really good. It's quite hard to explain the feel of it, but trust me it's good. 10/10 <br /> <br />Forgotten - a new sound for avril, which really suits her. It's quite a haunting song, she goes high and low on the \\" ah ah\\" bit, which is really strange, but good. This is worth loads of listens. 10/10 <br /> <br />Who Knows - This is a much brighter track, quite poppy, but what's wrong with that? It gives you a good outlook on life and is well, just fun! 10/10 <br /> <br />Fall to Pieces - I think this song sounds a little like \\"Naked\\" from her first album ( I don't mean the actual lyrics, I mean the tune), but my friend who has this doesn't agree, so maybe I'm just crazy. It's mid-tempo and I love the bit near the end where it goes \\"want to know who you are want to know where to start...\\" This isn't much like the rest of the songs, so it's interesting. 9/10 <br /> <br />Freak Out - This is all about just having fun and being free, it's a feel good song, which is very guitar driven like \\"He Wasn't.\\" Very cool. 9/10 <br /> <br />Slipped Away - A very emotional song about her Grandad's death, many can relate to the lyrics. It's touching and makes you think of the loved ones you've lost. This is an amazing ballad, defintely one of my favourites. 10/10 <br /> <br />I Always Get What I Want - This is my least favourite, it was written by the same person she wrote \\"Mobile\\" with, but isn't nearly as good. It's rocky and is also a bit short at 2.33 mins. 7/10 <br /> <br />If you like avril lavigne's style of music this is well worth the money you are paying for it, it's a great album! <br />
B0000DCGT0|4.0|Im surprized that so many are ripping this film. I found it very enjoyable. I guess you know the story, a beaten down horse comes to life at the races to sybolize new hope and new life for a depression ridden America. Toby McQuire(Spiderman) is a down and out jocky that fullfills his destiny. I liked the cast and the acting. Some great shots of various race tracks and beautiful horses. Some shots were \\"fudged\\" somewhat but it come across o.k. <br />They real fact here is the moral of the movie. Not to give up and keep trying. As the little hourse streaks to the finish you may find yourself tearing up a little... wishing for a simpler time when trust,kindness and faith were not dirty words.
B00000J7JO|5.0|What a comeback.  Somehow, John Frusciante (The virtuoso guitar player for the Chili Peppers who played on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik and then quit because of drugs) quits his insane nearly decade long heroin addiction and reunites with the Chili Peppers who are on hiatus after a one album stint and sum touring with Dave Navarro.  He comes back better than ever and regenerates the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  It is truly a blessing that he is even alive and still making music but it's great to have him back in the Chili Peppers. <br /> <br />1.Around The World-With a frenetically fast slap bass intro, this song starts off the album as one helluva ride.  The song shifts pretty quickly and the listener is greeted with a classic Frusciante riff and Kiedis' trademark white boy rapping which sounds like a proclamation of a band coming back from hell. <br />2.Parralel Universe-A new-wavy bass line and hihat work intro this song which packs a punch with a soaring chorus and a great Frusciante solo near the end. <br />3.Scar Tissue-John Frusciante's one true showcase of guitar playing.  The song is laced with multiple guitar interludes between chorus's and verses and builds up to a huge solo at the end.  The song is the first single off of the album and was a huge #1 smash. <br />4.Otherside-The third single off of the album and a song that really yet again balances the tightrope between soft and hard and really manages to pack quite a punch. <br />5.Get On Top-One of I'd say 4 songs off of the album that really sound like the Chili Peppers of the 80's.  Lotsa funky slap bass by Flea.  This song has playful lyrics that can be quite funny if you actually figure out what's being said.  Cool funky guitar playing by John in the bridge of the song. <br />6.Californication-This is probably the darkest song the band ever wrote besides perhaps Under The Bridge.  This song seems to deal with suicide and the horrors that Hollywood bring about like say plastic surgery.  Kurt Cobain is actually mentioned in the song.  Excellent bass work in the backround by Flea and a concise solo by John. <br />7.Easily-I like this song a lot and it never seems to get old.  The lyrics are really deep and paint a great picture.  Great overall performance. <br />8.Porcelain-This song almost succeeds at bringing down the album with its crappiness.  It just drags on and on very uneventfully for about 4 minutes of utter nothingness.  Best had it been left off of this album and never ever released. <br />9.Emmit Remmus-Cool song that yet again bridges that gap between soft and hard and really manages to be a good song.  Lyrically some parts are well bad such as \\"Summer time to talk and swear/Maybe later we could share some air\\" but still an overall great song.  <br />10.I Like Dirt-The second old school Chili Peppers styled song with funky bass and guitar playing mixed in with just odd as hell off the wall lyrics that somehow work in the song. <br />11.This Velvet Glove-Acoustic based song that has a obvious prevailing anti drug message. <br />12.Savior-Somehow this song feels like it would fit in well in a western movie but maybe that's just because of how the chorus hits me.  Yet again the Chili Peppers pull off a consistantly good song. <br />13.Purple Stain-The third old school styled Chili Peppers song with lyrics that you just have to read to believe.  There's references to fingering everywhere and a proclamation that Chris Farley is an angel.  It's cool how the last minute and a half just has the band jamming and has some cool drumwork by Chad Smith. <br />14.Right On Time-The fourth and final old school styled Chili Peppers song this song is splattered with pulsating slap bass by Flea and switches between the funky slap bass verses to the soft chorus.  At barely two minutes long this song really rocks out. <br />15.Road Trippin'-A fitting acoustic end to the musical journey that is Californication.  Featuring chamberlin organ and acoustic guitar this song really closes out the album well. <br /> <br />Overall-People should thank god that John Frusciante was even alive to make this album which never could've been done without him.  This album breathed new life into the Chili Peppers as well as expanded their musical horizons.  It is better crafted than anything from the last ten years and most of the 90s except perhaps Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Nirvana's Nevermind, and Metallica's \\"Black Album\\".  That's just my two cents.  Peace.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|One of the greatest albums Blue Note ever produced, this is the best album Dexter ever did (and that's saying a lot since he did many gems!).  Dexter is joined with one of jazz's best trio units (Sonny Clark on piano, who is my favorite pianist, Butch Warren on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums) on six different numbers.  \\"Cheesecake\\" is one of the coolest melodies ever written and shows how much of an underrated composer Dexter really was.  \\"I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" is one of the best ballad performances I've ever heard.  The listener can actually hear the sadness come out of Dex's horn!  \\"Second Balcony Jump\\" swings beyond belief, and the climactic ending is one of the best endings that you'll ever find on any jazz track.  \\"Love For Sale\\" is much different than the way Cannonball Adderley handles it on his classic \\"Somethin' Else\\" (check out my review for it), but is just as equally compelling to that version.  \\"Where Are You\\" provides another one of Dexter's amazing ballad performances, which most likely will move you just as much as the first ballad on this cd.  The album closes with \\"Three O'clock in the Morning\\", which brings the album to an amazing close with a more laid-back feeling than any other track found on the album.  You can't possibly call yourself a fan of Dexter Gordon or jazz in general and not have this classic, so pick it up, I swear you won't be dissapointed!
0553375636|5.0|I was thrown into this world in book one, and book two, Royal Assassin, just keeps me more entranced with the storyline and characters. Robin Hobb does an excellent job of writing books able to stand alone, and Royal Assassin does just that. <br /> <br />Fitz is trying to recover from his betrayal in Assassin's Apprentice. He hates everything about Regal, but has also sworn to protect the Farseer line, giving him conflicting loyalties. He also has both the Wit and the Skill, but is scared of those who use the Skill, especially those in the coterie. <br /> <br />Verity is trying to protect his people with his Skill and his fleet, but both are wearing him out. Finally, he can't do it any longer by himself and needs the help of the Elderlings, who saved the kingdom many years ago. Not knowing who or what they are, Verity leaves the kingdom in search of them, but also leaves the kingdom vulnerable to Regal and the Red Ship Raiders. <br /> <br />The conclusion to this book is one of the best I have ever read. I don't remember stopping for anything in the last 100 pages. Even with the ending, it had me thirsting for more with Robin Hobb's hints toward the next book. I highly recommend this book to fantasy and non-fantasy fans alike.
B0000025WQ|5.0|In 1980, Cyndi Lauper released an album with the band Blue Angel, which she led.  In the US, it flopped.  Then she was forced to quit because she lost her singing voice.  Doctors didn't expect her to sing again.  This almost shattered her dreams of success in music.  In the following years, she proved them wrong namely in 1984.  Those who know these events are amazed by her miraculous recovery as they listen to her sing.    When Cyndi Lauper released her debut album \\"She's So Unusual\\" and her first single \\"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\\", she instantly took the world by storm.  She was often compared to Madonna, who was also newly emerging at the time.  More than just her wild image and wild antics proved that she is a true work of art.  Such quality led many critics expecting her to stay on top for many years.  She later earned the Grammy for Best New Artist for 1984.    The wild pop music, which matches perfectly with her image, keeps listeners smiling through every note.  Its funky and dance additions keep the music unique and timeless.  Therefore, this is an album that capitalizes the 1980's.  The catchy beats remain catchy today.  Her throaty vocals blend perfectly with the theme and offers the added fun theme.  She never loses her edge with any song as she sings odes (...), girl power, love, and more.  Through the wildness, she rooms two ballads, which are performed beautifully: hit singles \\"Time After Time\\" and \\"All Through the Night\\".  Despite the mellow theme, the emotional value never loses its touch.      Her overall musical quality have many fans looking beyond her image and crediting her rightfully as a true artist.  \\"She's So Unusual\\" is the essential album for any Cyndi Lauper and/ or 1980's music fan.  This will surely keep listeners dancing for many more years.  Those interested in hearing a Cyndi Lauper update should also buy her 2003 successful release \\"At Last\\", which launched her as the biggest comeback of that year.  This combination makes for great musical enjoyment.
B00005JLTR|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BARBARA MOVIES, I HAVE WATCHED THE VIDEO SO MANY TIMES THAT THE PAST COUPLE OF TIMES MY VCR ATE THE TAPE!  LOL!  SO YOU SEE WHY I NEED IT TO BE AVAILABLE ON DVD! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHO IS A BARBARA FAN.  THE STUDIO SCENE WHEN SHE SINGS EVERGREEN BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES EVERYTIME!!
B00004Y6O7|4.0|That was my reaction the very first time I heard this album bustin' through my speakers.  It's like they had no intention of trying to produce a hit single, they just wanted to crank it up and play their fannies off for about 40 minutes.  Eddie is jaw-dropping amazing throughout all the tracks.  No wonder David Lee is caught goofing off during \\"Chains.\\"  He knew no one was going to be listening to his vocals on this one.  And \\"One foot out the door\\" may be Eddie's greatest lead ever (and that's saying a lot) because it's almost ALL lead guitar.  And that, in my book, makes for a great Van Halen album....
B00005RDCA|5.0|As all the reviews agree, this is a classic album and absolutely worth your money. I read a bunch of the reviews of this (double) album and no one mentioned the fact that you, basically, get two albums for the price of one, the stereo version and the mono version.  At the time it was not uncommon for record companies to insist on two different mixes of songs, or whole albums. Stereo systems were not standard equipment in homes or cars. AM radio was (and still is) a mono medium and that's where hit records were played. Many people didn't realize there were significant differences in the two officially released versions of this fantastic album. <br /> <br />Let me quote from the liner notes: <br />\\"The mono mix can be described as punchier, wheras the steeo mix is fuller, allowing the instruments more breathing room. The stereo mix also adds a few extra dollops of reverb, which alienated some fans and group members but met the approval of others. Grace, for one, liked it. 'This is farily complicated material and on a couple of Marty's ballads a flat, dry sound wouldn't have worked,' she says\\" <br /> <br />\\"Dyrden disagrees\\" It didn't sound like the band did onstage. The two guys that mentinoed that to me were Frank Zappa and paul Simon. They both said,' You sure got a lot of echo on that record.' I said, 'man, that's not our doing. We palyed it, they took it away and did what they did with it.'\\" <br /> <br />That's verbatim from the liner notes and pretty much covers it. The mono version sounds more like the band would sound live. The stereo is fat, reverby, and sounds \\"produced\\". The differences are NOT gigantic, but it is an interesting take on the same material.  <br /> <br />I actually prefer the mono version. But, that's just a personal preference. I must agree with Grace, some of the ballads do sound better with a  thicker sound. <br /> <br />Hope that helps. <br />Enjoy
B00005QXDD|5.0|Yes, this is definitely base humor, and is not for everyone, but if there is a part of you that can appreciate Beavis and Butthead, or Family Guy, or South Park, you will LOVE this CD.  While it may be true that it is more a comedy CD than a music CD, the tunes still ROCK.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended, for those who are not easily offended (no rhyme intended...HA).
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is a well made propaganda piece, similar to the infamous Triumph of the Will.  It is intended for one purpose only, and that is to bring about the removal of President Bush from office.  Given that goal, no low is too low for Moore.<br /><br />There are innumerable sources that show the factual errors in this movie.  (...)<br /><br />Make no mistake, it is a powerful movie.  It gets 1 star for its production and power.  It gets -5 stars because it is not a documentary, but a work of fiction.

0385512104|1.0|Being a parent of an \\"Aspie\\" being married to an \\"Aspie\\" and having \\"Aspie\\" traits myself, it was obvious to me that the book was written by an observer of Asperger's Syndrome/Autism. The book was a great observation but failed to present the rich inner life of an \\"Aspie\\" ... The main character's inner life was presented as being as flat as his voice where in truth it is very likely it is rich with imagery ... maybe even too much and confusing imagery. Communication is the problem ... not the mind's ability to create.

B0000026WD|4.0|'Dangerous' isn't really a bad album but it drives me NUTS!! <br />MJ is trying out his hand at every musical genre of the early <br />1990's as he can and the production is often cluttered or just <br />weird for weird's sake!Examples of this problem are overdone <br />but catchy dance tunes \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\" and \\"She Drives <br />Me Wild\\".Not to mention these songs tend to be saddled with the <br />early years of his whinny lyrics about 'wacko jacko'.Of course <br />on the way we're treated to the sultry \\"In The Closet\\",featuring <br />his voice as a percussion element and the fantasticly kinetic <br />\\"Jam\\".There's also the New Jack-inflected R&B of the classic <br />\\"Remember The Time\\" and the title song,both of whitch are far more timeless then much from that musical genre!And there's <br />\\"Black & White\\",a stonsy rock song that is a great follow up <br />to \\"Beat It\\" in Jackson's rock & roll crossover mission.That thankfully balances out the well meaning but highly cheesy <br />\\"Heal The World\\",a bad rewrite of 'We Are The World'-a much better song.A few odd moments like the near gospel of \\"Keep The Faith\\" and the big \\"Will You Be There\\" are also underpinned by a ill-advised stab at grunge in \\"Give In To Me\\" and the bizzare \\"Who Is It\\". <br />            Great most of the time this also marks Jackson's <br />hyper awareness of his own eccentricities as his lyrics go on <br />forever whinning about his personal wows.Jettisoning his producer <br />Quincy Jones was probably the dumbest desition he ever made-I think it also lost him a big chunk of his black audience.Still <br />these things would pale in comparasin to the very non musical <br />problems he's face from this point forward.One of the last time <br />the general public probably cared more about his music.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I have seen all three terminator movies, and T3 is my least favorite. The first two were creepy and original: a ruthless half man-half machine is sent from the future by an army of machines to terminate Sarah Connor, the future mother of John Connor, the man who will someday save earth from these machines. At the same time, the human race sends a man by the name of Kyle Reece to protect Sarah from this Terminator robot. It had an intriguing plot, cool action scenes, and an eerie feel to it.  <br /> <br />The second is the same principle, except set several years ahead with the two persons being sent back both being terminators, one, a liquid metal super terminator sent to kill now thirteen year old John Connor, and the other, the original flesh-on-machine Terminator from T1, sent by the humans to protect him. John convinces the Terminator to help him and his mother to prevent the machines from taking over the future altogether by destroying Cyberdine industries, the company that will someday lead to the rise of the machines. But doing so won't be so easy, as John Connor, Sarah Connor and the Terminator will be opposed by police, swat forces, and the deadly liquid metal terminator that is nearly impossible to destroy. It boasts an even better plot, awesome shoot outs and action scenes, and more modern special effects that blow away the cheesy effects of T1.  <br /> <br />T3 falls short of the standards set by its predessecors, mostly because of its bland, uninspired plot that goes absolutely nowhere with the story, doing nothing more than making room for another sequel.  <br /> <br />The plot is basically another, more advanced Termintor is sent to the past to kill a much older John Connor. The humans send another primitive, original model Terminator that they reprogrammed to protect John Connor. Naturally, John is confused by this, as ten years ago (in T2) he and his mother destroyed Cyberdine industries, the company that would someday create the defense network that would launch nuclear war on all earth's major cities and take over the world with an army of machines. The Terminator responds, telling him that\\"Judgement day is inevitable.\\" and his mission is to take John Connor and his future wife to a place where they will be safe until after the nuclear weapons are launched. But John Connor thinks that there is a chance to prevent such from happening (again), and they all head to a military base where the evil defense network will supposedly be activated. In a nutshell, they show up too late, and John Connor and his future wife are fooled into believing that a nearby bomb shelter contains the mainframe for the evil computer network. Upon arrival they learn that the bomb shelter didn't really contain the mainframe, the Terminator completed his ultimate mission of protecting John Connor and his future wife, and planet earth is nuked and overrun by evil machines whilst Mr. and Mrs. Connor lie in the nuke-proof bomb shelter. Hence the name, \\"Rise of the Machines\\". <br /> <br />As was emphasized above, I can't help but feel as though they were just trying to make a quick buck off the franchise.  I probably wouldn't go as far as to say that it's not worth watching at all, however, as it does have a few decent action scenes that should you entertained for a while, and there are a few quirks of humor here and there, and the special effects are have improved noticably since the first two. But aside from this, T3 doesn't have much going for it. Avoid or buy cheap, preferrably used. <br /> <br />Note: If you haven't seen T1 or T2, you will probably have some difficulty understanding what's going on in T3. I strongly advise that you get the first two before seeing T3.
B00000IL29|5.0|To me, at least, this is the highest point of Hancock's luminous career.  Other albums, especially Empyrean Isles, are all magnificent, but this is the best.   <br /> <br />This was Miles Davis' rhythm section, substituting Freddie Hubbard for Davis (Hubbard was the god of 60's trumpeting) and George Coleman for Wayne Shorter. Hubbard is phenomenal as always, (he's even better on Empyrean Isles) but the pleasant surprise if George Coleman.  This is one of his best sideman dates too.  My only complaint is he gets a lot less choruses than Freddie and Herbie.   <br /> <br />Ron Carter is his usual steady self, but it's Tony Williams who steals the show in the rhythm section.  Elvin Jones has always been my favorite drummer of the 60's, but I doubt even he could do better than the young Williams, who makes the drums sound almost as interesting as...everyone else!   <br /> <br />The compositions themselves are good, with the modal Maiden Voyage more about being a vehicle for improv rather than melody, the short little burst of fire in Eye of the Hurricane, and Survival of the Fittest, a calmer, far more lyrical mood in Little One (which features a brilliant solo by Coleman) and finally Dolphin Dance, the finest number on the album, with a great melody, harmonies, and perfect solos from all involved.  Herbie Hancock would do great things even after this album, but none of his voyages are better than his Maiden one.  This is ESSENTIAL jazz.
B00004LN16|2.0|All this album features is AC/DC re-writing songs they already wrote.  At least that's what it seems.  Everything sounds like we heard it somewhere before.  There are some good songs on the album however, but not enough to give it more than 2 stars.
B00006690G|1.0|Today's youth only know a few rappers: Eminem, 50 cent, she-12, etc., all f'd up commercial \\"rappers\\" who think they invented rap. If i let some of my friends listen to real rap hero's - Rakim, BDP, Schoolly D, Slick Rick, Whodini, etc. -, the first thing what they say is: that's whack! you schould listen to my new eminem cd!.. He's great!... and more of that bulls**t. The eminem show is a CD purely created for one purpose: Selling. (and screaming he's gonna kill his mother and cut the head of his ex-girlfriend off). I know a lot of you hiphop-\\"fans\\" think i'm wrong, but try listening to songs from BDP, Epmd, Whodini, Slick Rick, Eric B. & Rakim Etc., then you know what i'm talking about.
B000000OSO|4.0|This is not Aerosmith's best album.  This is not Aerosmith's worst album either however.  And when your worst album can have hit singles, an album that's in the middle can't be that bad. <br /> <br />Featured on this album is Livin' On The Edge, one of the best songs Tyler/Perry ever wrote.  The biggest fault of this album is that the quality of songs seem way lower than Livin' On The Edge.  If most of the songs were of the same quality, this would've been an amazing album, but as it stands only Cryin' comes close.
0553293397|5.0|Asimov brings back New York detective Elijah Baley and his robotic partner R. Daneel Olivaw in this second book of the Robot Series.  This time Baley is summoned to solve a case on the distant planet of Solaria.  Baley wishes to refuse, but his reputatition for solving crimes involving Spacers leaves him as the only choice.  On arriving on Solaria, he is glad to see his robotic partner from the planet Aurora, R. Daneel Olivaw, waiting there for him.  It seems that many planets have a stake in solving this crime on the usually crimeless world of Solaria.  Baley and Daneel discover a strange society in which humans shun personal contact and prefer to view each other through a sort of holographic transmission system.  The problem with this murder case is that only one person could have committed the murder, but it is impossible that she could have committed it.  Baley has to unravel the mystery of how a man was murdered on a planet where it is impossible. <br /> <br />Asimov has a light style that is easy to read and which pulls the reader into the story.  It's difficult to put down.  One word for those who have read the first novel, The Caves of Steel.  If you're a bid fan of Daneel, be aware that he plays a smaller role in this second novel.  Baley is the star here.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When this film came out in theatres, it was doused with an endless amount of negative reviews, mostly because it starred Ashton Kutcher. This really isn't a film to be judged by its acting. Sure, they may have been able to find someone a little better, but Ashton gets the job done here and that's all the movie needs.    The Butterfly Effect is about the chaos theory. It is about a man who finds a way to recall his blacked-out memories from certain points in his childhood. When he was a kid, he didn't know why he kept blacking things out, so doctors suggested having him keep a journal. They suggest that he write in it everything that he does to help jog his memory if he blacks something out.    The movie is entertaining with its interesting premise, and it's at least decent acting. Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart do an excellent job as Evan and Kayleigh, along with Eric Stoltz as Kayleigh's father, and Elden Henson as Lenny. Just prepare for an entertaining ride with some very neat twists in it. This is a thinking movie, and a good one at that. I think the less you know about it before you watch it, the better it will be when you watch it.    The DVD has a decent amount of supplements, with one part covering the history of the chaos theory and time travel, and a fact track. The All-Access Pass features cover more behind-the-scenes details, with commentary from the filmmakers, and documentaries on \\"the creative process\\", which is mostly about what the directors went through for pre-production, and a \\"visual effects\\" documentary. That of course explores the visual effects of the film. Also included on the disc are a storyboard gallery and the original theatrical trailer. For those with DVD-ROM drives, included is a script-to-screen option, which allows you to watch the film while reading the script. Along with that, there is a \\"commentary digest\\", which allows you to hear specific bits of commentary that weren't included in the commentary track for the film. And finally to round it out there is an image gallery and some links to other infinifilm DVDs.
B00023B1LC|2.0|This edition is NOT better than the first (single disc) edition. Why would they do an \\"Extra Extended\\" edition and leave off the DTS sound? The original (single disc) has DTS. Isn't that's what DVD is all about, great sound as well as picture quality? <br /> <br />Don't waste your money, if you already have the original copy...keep it!
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence is a band that seems to play the same riff over and over again. In fact, my boyfriend sat down with his guitar, and learned the riffs in just about one try! All the songs have the same melody....and has no tone what-so-ever! When I originally heard that song \\"bring me to life\\", I thought it was kind of interesting the way her voice sounded so angelic. So then I saw the band play live, and her voice sounded like she was going to literally shatter glass. It was so hilarious to watch the whole band try to over do it....jumping around....acting like they are playing crazy insane difficult music.  <br /> <br />What I don't understand is, why a band like this, who plays repetitive, untalented music, gets all the glory while there are the most talented bands practically living in their car waiting to get heard. Take for an example, Lacuna Coil, who I highly suggest anyone see live or at least get their CD, is always compared with Evanescence. Ok, why? Maybe because both bands have girl singers, and they have that whole goth image. Ok, but that is IT. Every song on Lacuna Coil's album is different, and when you hear them live, it actually sounds better than the CD. I CANNOT say the same for Evanescence. They sound horrible live, all the songs sound the same, and Amy Lee can't hold a note for the life of her. If you trust me then good.....if you don't, then go download one of their live performances right now! Or just go to one of their concerts! I promise it's true....      <br /> <br />I don't care if people say that they are wanna-be goths....the point of the matter is, is that they should be talented at what they do. They can play classical music and say that they are punk....whatever.....it only matters that they have knowledge and talent at what they are playing.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I give this album 2 stars because they are not completely hopeless......but they are in need of some serious change. i.e.-Amy Lee needs to take some vocal classes, and the rest of her band needs to step up to the plate and play the way they jump around onstage. Nuff said!
B004IK30S2|5.0|\\"Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy\\" is funny! Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy is excellently funny. Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone is funny. Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana, Steve Carell as Brick Tamland, David Koechner as Champ Kind, Fred Willard as Ed Harken round out the rest of the funny cast. Adam McKay's directing is excellent, he makes his directorial debut here. The story and screenplay by Ferrell and McKay is excellent. The music by Alex Wurman is excellent. The cinematography by Thomas E. Ackerman is excellent. The film editing by Brent White is excellent. The casting by Juel Bestrop, Blythe Cappello, Jeanne McCarthy is excellent. The production design by Clayton Hartley and costume design by Debra McGuire is excellent. The art direction by Virginia L. Randolph is excellent. The set decoration by Jan Pascale is excellent. This is an excellent comedy that you will be probably quoting for the rest of the summer.
078401213X|4.0|I rate this film... 3.14! Get it? I rounded it off to four (4) stars since there is no 3.14. Math fanatics may question the decision to round up, but I say three is not enough. Is four too much? Perhaps, but that is like doing an equation that involves a circle (or a SPIRAL!)and saying, Hmmm. Maybe I'll just plug in... three. I don't even want to think about how ridiculously incorrect the answer would be. It probably wouldn't even be a selection in the multiple choice categories of A, B, C, D, and sometimes E.  On the other hand, four (4) may be used in order to get an answer in this lineup of choices, provided of course that the professor had lost his marbles! Better to go with choice E than embarrass yourself.  Statistically speaking, provided E= None of the above, it would be best to choose either B or D. Unless of course there is not an E, in which case you would choose C.
B00005JN2X|5.0|\\"Collateral\\" is brilliant! This is Tom Cruise's best movie and performance of his career, and is also Jamie Foxx's best movie and performance of his career. Michael Mann's direction is brilliant and this is his best movie ever since \\"Heat\\" (1995). Tom Cruise plays Vincent and Jamie Foxx plays Max, whose lives are changed in just one night. Vincent is an assassin hired to kill 5 witnesses in one night and he pays Max $600 to drive him around to the places he needs to go to and an extra $100 to bring him to the airport. Tom Cruise has never done a character like this, until now, and I still like him, because he is a likable guy and has played likable characters. It was a challenge for me to decide, whether or not, that I liked Vincent, but I did, though, even if, he is a bad guy, in some senses of the word \\"bad\\". Rounding out the cast is Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning & Peter Berg as Richard Weidner, two cops who are involved in the case. Bruce McGill as Pedrosa, An FBI agent who is also involved in the case. Irma P. Hall as Ida, Max's mother, & Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel, another one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill. They are excellent and well motivated. Stuart Beattie's story and screenplay is brilliant and well written and also well crafted. The music by James Newton Howard is excellent and well synthesized. There is also additional music by Antonio Pinto, Tom Rothrock & Zachary Koretz, which is also excellent and well synthesized. The cinematography by Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron is brilliant and well shot. 80% of the film was shot on digital video, which makes it looks better. The film editing by Jim Miller & Paul Rubell is excellent. The casting by Francine Maisler is excellent. The production design by David Wasco (who production designed \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" (2003) & \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" (2004) is brilliant and well designed. The art direction by Daniel T. Dorrance is brilliant and well crafted. The set decoration by Sandy Reynolds-Wasco (who decorated the sets for \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" (2003) & \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" (2004) is brilliant and well decorated. The costume design by Jeffrey Kurland (who designed the costumes recently this year for \\"Hidalgo\\" (2004) is excellent. The hair and make-up on Tom Cruise's Vincent is brilliant and at times, you can't hardly recognize that it is Tom Cruise. This is a well crafted and well made movie with Oscar written all over it. Tom Cruise (Best Actor), Jamie Foxx (Best Supporting Actor), Michael Mann (Best Director), Stuart Beattie (Best Original Screenplay), James Newton Howard (Best Original Score), Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron (Best Cinematography), & David Wasco (Sandy Reynolds-Wasco & Daniel T. Dorrance) (Best Art Direction - Set Decoration), are potential Oscar nominees for next year's Oscars. This is an mesmerizing masterpiece.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|It was very hard to sit through....not interesting at all....my family and I all hated it!!! I expected more from it.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon was one the best albums of it's time and continues to appeal to new music fans around the world. It's a short but brilliant album, exploring sonic textures to their fullest. It moves at a relaxed pace, yet still manages to keep you along for the haunting ride it has to offer. Although it has its radio staples \\"Money\\" and \\"Time,\\" DSOTM's true \\"gem\\" is (Us and Them) It's a song that takes you on a roller coaster from start to finish, with it's jazz and blues sounding instrument sections to it's massive buildup into the amazing chorus's. Adding to the Legacy of the album is that it can be played along perfectly to the Wizard of Oz for some Mysterious moments that make it seem as if the album was made to play along to the film. DSOTM is also Pink Floyd's best \\"Casual Listener friendly\\" album so if your new to the band I recommend starting your Pink Floyd collection with this great album.
B000068FUS|4.0|i'd like to give this a higher rating, but so far--i'm allowing it time to grow--this two-disc concept album based around the rise and fall of lynyrd skynyrd sounds kinda samey...meaning that the songs all, well, have certain similarities. lyrically, i was very impressed. these guys aren't the white trash troubadours they sometimes come off as (indeed, they usually strive to come off this way); they have a message. and that message is something along the lines of \\"the south is a great place both because of and in spite of all the bad stuff that's gone down here.\\" they're good ol' southern boys, don't doubt that for a second, and they love their dixie...but they hate racists and they speak out about how regretful they are that it was ever an issue. these guys are now officially an athens band, though they started up in alabama and sing most of their songs about that state. and they do, they do sound like their idols, lynyrd skynyrd, only not so needlessly polished, more off-the-cuff, more, well rocking.
B000002HRE|3.0|This album gets 3 stars mainly because the first four songs are very good with great lyrics (although the la da da da da in the middle of \\"The Memory Remains\\" is pretty creepy). After \\"The Unforgiven II\\" this album gets very repetative, it's like they take one song, use the same notes, make a different chorus and different lyrics. This was probably taken from the Load sessions that didn't end up on Load. Kirks guitar talent, however are quite evident on this album. This is also the final album with Newsted and if you love Metallica you should get it.  <br /> <br />Guitars - Talented but after the fourth song very repetative. <br />Bass - Thick and loud, Newsted was great. <br />Drums - Not as complex or pounding as previous albums, still good though. <br />Vocals - Good, could be better though. <br />Lyrics - The last songs with good lyrics. <br /> <br />Kill em' All - 5 stars\5 <br />Ride the Lightening - 4.5 stars\5 <br />Master of Puppets - 5 stars\5 <br />...And Justice for All - 5 stars\5 <br />Black Album - 6 stars\5 <br />Load - 4 stars\5 <br />Reload - 3 stars\5 <br />St. Anger - 1.5 stars\5
B000099T3P|5.0|This is my favorite of all the Critters movies. I saw this when I was younger and I still think it's one of the scariest films ever. The second film was really good, but the last 2 kind of went off track. I own all 4 films on dvd and recommend them to anyone who is a fan as I am.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Terrible, horrible, abysmal, poseur rap with s****y rap, crappy lyrics, dreadful singing. Eminem is one of the scummiest losers ever to live and now he tries to sing? He sounds worse than that Chester freak from Linkin Park, and that's pretty damn s****y. This kills the rest of his crappy band with the elevator music in the backround and how is he punished? He goes platinum and gets all the publicity. F*****s, s***heads, b*****s, asses, losers, freaks, you name it thats what they are. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this bulls*** from one of the biggest losers\wiggers\poseurs\scumbags\freaks ever.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Though many people I've spoke to think the movie is boooring, I find it intriguing. The cinematography is classy, and the soundtrack is haunting. There are many aspects to the film that question creation and psychology. This isn't your action packed-blow stuff up kind of flick. It's definately a thinker's movie along the same lines as Gattaca. I highly recommend if you're into deep concept sci-fi.
B000000OQF|4.0|In my opinion there are only two good\great hairmetal bands and G N' R (Van Halen as well) is one of them. Appetite for Destruction was good enough to save metal long enough to have people love it for the next 5 years. Then Nirvana came into the mainstream. Back to the review, Slash is a great lead guitarist who has little flaws and Izzy has a great rhythem. Duff is a bassist of thickness, intensity and loudness with Axl's screaming vocals and raunchy (awesome) lyrics. Steve Adler was no Neil Pert but he was not bad either, I guess he made the songs more intense. Some songs however, have repetativeness and thats why this got 4 stars. If you are a Hairmetal fan then buy this along with UyI 1+2 and VH I+II. Even if you like punk and grunge, or even rap\rock you should get this.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|don't believe any of the 5 stars you see here. I am so glad I did not waste my money on this boring, senseless movie, since I saw it on cable. I was looking forward to seeing it after reading so much good things about it. Wow...what a disappointment. I kept waiting and waiting for something to develop that would justify the acclaims it received, but it never came. In the middle of the movie, I muttered to myself...\\"and Coppola won an Oscar for screenplay?!\\" The movie is not funny, and it is not dramatic. What it is is a waste of time.
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen... such a gay name can fool so many, however their music is not gay at all, in fact quite awesome. Freddie Mercury is one of the top five greatest lead singers since, well ever, and he could play the piano for damn sure. Bohemian Rhapsody is one of my top ten favorite songs of all time and even though it has a piano it is still great, remarkable. Their guitarist is pretty good too although you don't here the bassist and drummer that well. These guys were voted the thirteenth greatest band of all time by vh1 and they definately worked for it. From 12 to 1 its about influence and music, from 100 to 13 its only about music and Queen had better music than the many artists that didn't beat them. Buy this album even if you don't necessarily prefer the piano, it's great and besides, Freddie doesn't always use the piano (like in \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\").  <br />Rest in Peace Freddie Mercury, we'll miss you.
B000002WYT|1.0|I just don't get it.  This band is not as spiffy as many people would like to believe.  It is also another way for college boys, or un-college boys to devote their time trying to use music to \\"win\\" that one girl over.. just to leave that one girl completely bitter towards this group and this cd.   <br /> <br />If you are into REAL music that isn't on the Top 40, try something else.
B00009UW0N|5.0|\\"Halloween\\" remains my all-time favorite horror movie and still scares me every time I watch it. Scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't aged much and neither has this film. From Michael Myers' grisly first crime at age 6 to bloodthirsty romp as an insane asylum escapee - and his refusal to die - the viewer will remain scrunched down in their seat, glad that it's only a movie.
B00004W52U|5.0|Someone should make all those punk wannabes *cough* Avril *cough* that play \\"punk music\\" sit down and listen to this record, then reevaluate how they play, and then stop cause noone can touch this record, or the energy emenating from it. It's just pure radness from beggining to end, from Knowledge, to Sound System, to Take Warning, and so on, it's just pure punk/ska/reggea/ whatever you wanna call it music. There thats it, now buy this record.
B000002LND|5.0|Fans of Madonna can listen to her continuing evolvement as an artist in this collection of her biggest hits. From the dark richness of \\"Live to Tell\\" to the irresistible dance beat of \\"Into the Groove\\" this CD remains a fave after ten years. Madonna, you go girl....and I'm sure you will.
B000002LND|5.0|Re-live Madonna's best hits on this CD. \\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"In the Groove\\" are among the selections you get. Great stuff!
B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's debut album continues to thrill two decades after its release, and remains solid proof that critics who claimed she was a flash in the pan who wouldn't last lacked ear canals. Serious Madonna fans will enjoy this remastered mix, and younger fans will enjoy the danceability of her early works. A must for the dance music fan and, of course, Madonnaholics
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I LOVE this album! It is the best album out of her three and each song is different and unique in its own way, and will keep you humming the tunes for days! When i first got it, i wasn't to keen but the more i listen, the more addictive it got, with songs like, heavy on my heart and rearview, you will have this CD in your player for weeks! Definitly reccomended for someone who likes music that isn't cheesy pop!
B000002NJS|5.0|The irreverent, multi-talented musician reinvents herself yet again with this fabulous collection of sound. Lady Madonna doesn't get older - she just gets better!
B00000JTB2|5.0|I'm not a guitar player, but I do know something about the ways to play and the techniques involved. I'm 50 yrs old and I have seen and heard some of the best guitarists ever. In my humble musical opinion, this is the best blues guitar album I believe I own,(and I have over 700 cd's). I was talking to Kim Simmonds, guitar player(Savoy Brown) at a recent blues festival in the \\"Burgh\\" and he said the remarkable thing about this album was Stevie Rays ability to play with restraint. He had a RESPECT for his guitar. Kim said, \\"Stevie was a musician, not just a guitar player.\\" What can you say about Albert King, just listen.
B000006TRV|5.0|If it were possible, this remastering improves on the original. Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" will always be their masterwork, but \\"The Wall\\" with its dark and accurate jabs at the establishment, runs a close second. Don't miss it
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is a genius.  This movie is original and well worth seeing.  Uma Thurman is superb and was the perfect choice for the role of Black Mamba.  It's not just a blood bath as I saw someone say it is an amazing movie which deals with many serious issues but is at the same time very entertaining.  It's not for everybody but it is brilliant.
B000002N3J|5.0|This collection of sweet ballads shows Madonna's versatility as an artist with a refreshing change from her great dance pieces. From the timeless \\"Take a Bow\\" to the richness of \\"Rain\\", this CD is sure to please Madonna's most hardcore fan.
B00003CY6M|1.0|I think they made an error in the name of the movie it should have been called Stupidity not Serendipity.  I'm so glad it was my friends money which was wasted on renting this poor excuse for a movie and not my own - it completely sucked.  Unless you are into EXTREMELY cheesy and pathetic movies do not buy this it is a time waster.
B00002Z88D|5.0|If you want classic, head-banging heavy metal, you won't like this album, but if you want to see Metallica give a fresh twist to already-masterful material, don't miss this album! The San Francisco Symphony rocks as hard as the master band through all their greatest hits. A must-have!
0743201140|4.0|I have definitely changed the way I think about strengths and talents because of this book.  Definitely a great read for anyone wondering if you're on the right path. <br /> <br />one complaint was that my book cover did not have the personal ID code to take the strengthsfinder test.  However, through three or four emails to to the folks at Gallup, they provided one for me.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Ignore \\"Dude, Where's My Car\\" and the campy pranks on Punk'd - Ashton Kutcher is first and foremost an actor, and it shows in this dark drama of a sex abuse survivor who struggles to change history to protect both himself and those he loves. An interesting premise based on the \\"if you could, should you try\\"? question of time travel and altering history. Kutcher's angst is excellent in this accurate portrayal of an abuse survivor.  The scenes of child molestation, while suggested and not shown, are deeply disturbing as they should be. Recommend for very mature audiences.
6305949980|5.0|A great adult animation film!! Tim Burton has blended stop action animation into a world of fantasy that is worthy of watching again and again.<br /><br />Jack Skellington is a long lanky skeleton who exists to inspire a creepy town on Halloween but alas he begins to desire something more. In his explorations he discovers an opening into a Christmas town where life exists with lights, presents and gaiety. Because of the theory that the grass is always greener on the other side our sad Jack feels the need to possess Santa and bring him back to his own dark Halloweentown while Jack becomes the new Santa. The story is great and a darkly humorous slap in the face of our over commercialized Christmas holiday. Along with Jack a cast of interesting characters exist in Halloweentown: Dr. Finklestein (a silly duck like version of Frankenstein), Sally (a lightly sewn together lady who needs a lot of stitches), Mayor (a two faced fatso with constant anxiety), and many others just as entertaining.<br /><br />This film would not be complete had it not been for Danny Elfman's musical score. The background music is really beautiful along the lines of a fairy tale with twists of horror laced in between. The lyrics for the songs are brilliantly poetic in a Halloweentown type of way and you may even find yourself humming a few for days afterwards. This is a must see DVD for every Halloween to come and maybe even the following Christmas just to add some nightmares into the overly sappy day!
0790729687|5.0|Anne Rice's fans won't be disappointed with this masterful rendering of her classic novel, even the ones, like moi, who were outraged when Tom Cruise was cast as Lestat. Cruise more than delivers, and Brad Pitt oozes sex appeal as the tormented Louis. The ending, with Guns and Roses warbling \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is a great, sly touch.
B00009ATIX|2.0|For Sci-Fi lovers this is probably a great movie but for people who prefer their romance stories on earth it is a little too spacey.<br /><br />The director for this film is Steven Soderbergh and he tends to capture all of the scenes in dark close-ups of body parts and profiles while new age subliminal music plays in the background. There are too many moments of quiet and unexplained emotions shrouded in the complexities and visual harshness of a space station. The story is interesting but may have worked better on earth rather than aboard an alien type space mobile. Psychologist Kelvin (played by George Clooney) is called to resolve lost communications aboard a space station in orbit around an alien planet. From this point we are left to contemplate the circumstances taking place aboard the craft.<br /><br />George Clooney is decent in his role as a space psychologist attempting to resolve a mystery aboard a space station, but he has way too many dark close-ups. Aboard the ship he tries to deal with eerie circumstances that involve dead loved ones seeming to come back to the crew members in dreams or is it in reality. Jeremy Davies plays a kooky crew member who actually looks a little too much like Charles Manson to be likable! Clooney's wife is played nicely by Natascha McElhone. Clooney and McElhone pass back and forth between dreams and reality, future and past during their romance and old issues are brought forth in an attempt to re-configure them into something more reasonable. But the viewers are left to decide what truth is and what is misconstrued by the alien infection.<br /><br />The ending of this film is abstract and will leave one with a choice between heaven, dreams or reality as the existing environment. Will the future of love exist only under controlled circumstances or will life continue as normal far from the glow of Solaris?
B00028HBKM|2.0|Christ's true message of love and redemption is completely lost in this bloody, torture-filled horror show. Christians will be grossed out and disappointed, and those most in need of Jesus' offer of eternal redemption will miss it in this repulsive waste of film. Avoid at all costs. Rent \\"The Ten Commandments\\" or \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" instead.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Recorded over 35 shows during her 1998 spring tour in support of her award-winning, multi-platinum 1997 album, Surfacing, this 14-track collection is more a greatest hits package than anything else.     Released at the front end of what might be Lilith Fair's last hurrah, Mirrorball is a take-home sampler of the live performances that have catapulted McLachlan into the modern rock stratosphere. Over half of the album's 14 songs are radio hits (including four of the first five), proving McLachlan's worth as a pop songstress bar none, but also hinting at an underlying stagnation in her recent musical output. Though fans of McLachlan and folks who missed her Lilith performances will likely enjoy Mirrorball, it's a little too by-the-book to win any converts or please critical listeners    If you're into alternate versions, there is some notable noodling around on tracks like Good Enough, I Will Remember You, Aida, Fear and Possession.     However, in terms of standouts, listen to the dreamy I Love You and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, the pretty Do What You Have To Do, and the trippy but danceable Fear and Possession. My favorite song on the CD is icecream. Lacking any real lyrics, you feel her love for the music as she gets into this song.    Also helpful for those unable to wrap their own voices around some of McLachlan's higher or more drawn-out notes are the lyrics to all the songs provided in the liner notes.     Keep in mind that I have seen her live so my opinion may hold some bias. She is twenty times better live then on CD. She interacts with the crowd and relives her writing experience with some of her songs - all of which was left out of the CD.      All in all a great album of her best work with a live atmosphere to it.    Final Say: If you're a Sarah fan, buy this CD you'll love it. B+
6305558167|5.0|Boorman's classic remains a timeless treasure in the near-quarter century since its release. Nicol Williamson's witty and wondrous portrayal of Merlin remains the standard for other actors in lesser versions of the Round Table to emulate. Helen Mirren and Nigel Terry, in early screen appearances, give promise of the careers to come. Brilliant cinematography and powerful emotion will leave fantasy fans speechless.
0060989157|5.0|Well I feel as if i've been on a long wild journey and it's been wonderful! I am a few years younger than the Crue but was always a huge fan, have every CD and saw them live and met them once. They were wonderful then and still are.  This book is so well written, the style is different with it's rotating chapters. At times I laughed and other times I had tears in my eyes...many tears. Each member has his own identy and it's interesting to see how each one of them became who they are. You can't help but like each one for different reasons. Vince the sexy lead singer, Tommy the wild/crazy drummer whose always smiling, Nikki my favorite bass player because in the 80's when I was dressing and looking like I was in a \\"hair band\\" my nickname was Nikki due to the fact that I wore my hair the same way...GOD I MISS THOSE DAYS!!! Sweet Mick who truly must be a kind and gentle soul.  This book was difficult to put down and when I did have to put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again. It brought back many memories of a time that will live forever in my mind and I'd do anything to bring those days back. Best wishes to each member and if I could, I'd hug each one of you for all the up's and downs you each have endured through the 10+ year ride, I feel as if I've been on the ride with you and all I can say was thanks for the memories and WOW WHAT A RIDE!!!
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's signature sound continues to grow in this signaturely dark piece, with the band outdoing itself with spectacular new material. Lars Ulrich is still the best
B0001NBMBC|2.0|For starters, I found that this album got boring with repeated listens. I quite liked it at first, but each time I played the cd, I enjoyed it less and less. No re-listen value. Another reason is a reason that apply's to the band it self: nine guys in jumpsuits and masks? I must say that is kind of lame. And although the music end of this is better than their previous 2, I would've thought that nine members in a band would come up with some great music, since bands such as Exodus and Testament really rip with five members. But, unforuneately things didn't work that way.<br />On the other hand, I find &quot;duality&quot; and &quot;pulse of the maggots&quot;<br />as decent tunes. I don't care 'bout the rest. I don't mean to offend anyone, but spend your hard earned money else-where
B000000OQF|5.0|The band's debut album still shines, giving no hint of the disappointment to come when egos, mental illness, and just plain stupidity on the part of the bandmembers ruined a promising career. One must hope that someday they will wise up, grow up, and return to the recording studio.
B000003C4K|5.0|This is one hell of a good cd. Anyone who likes this style of music  would surely love this. Only one downfall, in my opinion. Lot's of people will hate me for this...<br />I'm not big on Baloff's vocals! I prefer Steve Souza's vocals. Not saying Paul Baloff isn't good, I just like Steve Souza's raspy screech. But still, this and Fabulous Disaster are my favourite Exodus albums.Buy or die!
0887308589|5.0|Corporate America continues to undermine itself with bumbling tales of bad management and poor policy. As always, Adams pokes fun at the pompous with his true tales of corporate mayhem. A must read for the burnt out and the enraged in the business world
B000089RVX|5.0|I will never understand people. I can fully understand not liking a certain band or their music, and I can understand that people would like to share their opinions. I feel that there is a huge difference between sharing your likes and dislikes and spouting out ignorant things like \\"They are Sh*t.\\" I completely disagree with alot of these reviews, most of them are completely based on false facts. The common pattern that all the reviews seem to follow are:     1. They start off by insulting the band by calling them some name or ridiculing the name of the band.     2. They follow up with some unsubstantiated fact about why the band is around, or give some poorly supported reason as to why they dislike them (some reviewers actually used the words \\"dumb face\\" in a review, that is about as mature as \\"poopy head\\" but its worse because it makes less sense).     3.  The Person ends with a lame comparison to another band or names a band that is supposedly better.    The album is good, I enjoy it very much and I am a big fan of Evanescence. Amy Lee has a very strong angelic voice with a beautiful resonance to it, and a great range...anybody who tells you that she can't sing, has no idea what they are talking about, it is one thing to not like her voice or singing style, but saying that she cannot sing is entirely untrue. I am sure that there are many places where you can preview this album, so if you like what you hear then buy it. Regardless, of how you feel about it, you have a right to express your opinion. I just suggest you do it intelligently.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|A great adventure story and wondrous cinematography make this a film not to be missed. Crowe's portrayal of Captain Jack Aubrey is Oscar-worthy and a shame that he was overlooked. ALthough somewhat swept aside by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" last year, this film is still one of the year's best. An accurate depiction of naval life and excellent performance by the newcomers, especially the young midshipmen. Don't miss it!
B000002B35|5.0|This album contains a lot of sounds that remain us to another place in the universe, songs like Money and Another Brick in the wall III sounds terrific. We can appreciate different kind of sounds and rythms added into a concert that will be remembered by the history of the music. The guitarrs, bass and the voices were glorius.
B000000OSE|5.0|....this band's creative genius is evident in this CD and its sequel, Use Your Illusion II. Fans of Guns and Roses can't help but grieve, however, for the brilliance squandered by the aborted tours, egos, and emotional fits thrown by the bandmembers. What a sad epilogue to fabulous careers. One must hope that they will wise up and return to creativity, not ego carnage
B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie was hilarious. It's about a brother that wants to protect his mentally ill sister. Mary Stuart Masterson plays Joon, a very convincing mentally ill person. She is the perfect actress for the part. Aidan Quinn plays her brother, Benny. His show seems so natural and rock hard. Johnny depp plays Sam, a comic expert that is \\"won\\" by Joon in a poker game. After some time they fall in love to the disapointment of Benny. Johnny steals the movie with his funny proformance and facial expressions. It is the best movies of that year!

B00003CXB4|5.0|Adults as well as children will adore this spellbinding fairy tale and the now-classic soundtrack by Elton John. Hum along with \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" while you enjoy the voices of James Earl Jones and Whoopi Goldberg. Simba forever!
0792833260|4.0|Several recent movies have also shown men and fathers in a much more humane light. The Academy Award winning \\"Rain Man\\" though publicized in a way which seemed a deliberate attempt to make certain that it did not appeal to men, is actually a very interesting story about two brothers. One brother is a selfish, manipulative, and exploitive at the beginning of the movie, but changes throughout the movie into a real human being. In fact, he puts up a fight for custody of his autistic brother. Dad would enjoy this movie. A single explicit scene prevents this movie for viewing by children. <br /> <br />
6304240554|5.0|The ultimate gross-out good time, \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is still one of the best zombiefests ever made. Everyone who has ever fantasized about being locked in a shopping mall overnight will find something else to dream about - or hope they will. Bon appetit!
B0001HLVS2|4.0|This movie is based on one of the adventure novels in the Master and Commander series by author Patrick O'Brian. It is a tried and true story, one country (in this case a ship full of British~ (HMS Surprise) and another country (Napoleon's French forces), fighting over freedom. Although it is the same story, good vs. evil, you never get tired of the good guy kicking some butt. The crew of the Surprise takes a hit in the opening rounds, but comes back with a plan and some guts. Whether or not you like nautical movies, this movie, for sheer enjoyment, is worth the money for rental. Not a lot of battle scenes (only 3) or a lot of blood, gore, and guts, but an unexpected twist at the end, make it a great movie. If you want some decompression time, see this one. It will be worth it.
B00003CX9W|2.0|...that most others do. As one who grew up watching Disney flicks at the theater every Saturday, this one is my all-time least favorite. The problem with \\"Fantasia\\" is that it's a film that adults love because they think they would have adored it as children. In fact, it's hard to keep kids occupied with this film, with its endless interruptions to have Mickey chat up the conductor. Boring for adults and unbearable for youth with short attention spans. I remember being bored to death watching it at six, and so were the other kids, because we had more fun having popcorn fights and running up and down the aisles than we did watching the movie. Try parking your eight year old in front of it and clock how long it takes him to get bored and walk away, and you'll see the real disappointment in this movie.
B00005JN2F|3.0|I personally did not like this movie as much as I liked The Bourne Identity, but it is still thoroughly enjoyable. The storyline is the best part. Also, there is an awesome car chase scene; the only problem I have with this movie is the way they filmed some of the action sequences (with the unstable camera). Sure it makes it seem more realistic, but the audience misses out somewhat on the otherwise cool fight scenes.
B00008CLOA|5.0|....a modern remastering of the masterful classic.  Still one of the best albums ever recorded and a must-have even if you own the vinyl LP, cassette, and original CD versions.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Here's one of my favorite jokes: <br />Q: How many Slipknot memebers does it take to screw in a light bulb? <br />A: Nine. Five to screw in the light bulb, the other four to jump around and do nothing. <br />^^^ <br />That couldn't be more true. Anyone who thinks that Slipknot has talent is way off. Take a look at the tabs for them on the Internet. Then look at some, oh, say, Dream Theater tabs. Notice the huge difference in complexity. Corey Taylor has good vocals? Nah. He wails, screams, and cries to get his horrible lyrics across. That's not good vocals. Joey is a good drummer? Well, I will admit that he does have some talent. But he's not a drumming god, he's just a talented player in a band of crap. <br />Now, on to the album. <br />I really fail to see why people can like this. The musicmanship is poor, and the lyrics are just 20-year-olds trying to look tough and scary by cussing every other word and pretending to hate everything. I guess the real reason people listen to this is because they think it makes them look tough and bad-ass. Also I would assume it's because the media supports this crap, making it look like it's the best stuff ever. A lot of people don't know any better. <br />I know some people with an educated musical opinion like this, and I can respect that. But for people who just listen to this to look cool and badass, ugh. Just ugh. Want talent and technicality? Try some Liquid Tension Experiment. Want something heavy? Try Immortal.
B00009TB5G|1.0|Three books and three movies.  It fits.  But boy can I tell you this middle movie is boring.  Outright a waste of nearly three hours.  Why?  The plot goes nowhere where a simple addition onto the ending of The Fellowship Of The Ring or onto the intro of The Return Of The King couldn't take the audience. <br /> <br />Where does it go?  Well, Gollum is introduced, and Frodo and Sam, separated from the rest of the Fellowship, go hardly nowhere on their quest to destroy The Ring.  It seems to me that their capture by men on the few steps they take in this movie is a useless plot twist.  It doesn't change the story, there's no effect, and no cause.  No, we get to hear that the story will be worth telling by others to their children.  Boring, get on with the story. <br /> <br />As for Aargon's campaign, and the battle at Helm's Deep, this is also useless, pointless, and has no effect on the story.  This isn't the battle for all of mankind like it is stated, \\"the battle to destroy the world of men.\\"  Even if Soloman's men did kill Aaragon and his men, the men of Middle Earth would still be in existance, as they battle the forces from the Mountain Of Fire in the next movie. <br /> <br />Also, Gollum's true hostile, menevolent character is not present, just \\"yes master\\" this and \\"yes master\\" that.  No where to be seen is the audience to fear him, to possess the ring, and end Frodo's campaign.  The introduction of Treebeard is the only selling point of this three hours but it nowhere comes close to making the movie anything but boring and pointless. <br /> <br />And another thing, why doesn't this rich director and the rest of the producers of the trilogy quit trying to score additional cheap shots at the general public and release the extended edition of the movies initially.  If he cared so much about maintaining the integrety of the literature that he is reproducing on film, why is he trying to profit twice on it? <br /> <br />At the conclusion of this movie, I have foundthat it left me with the feeling that something is missing, and also with the question of why I found both the first movie and the last of this trilogy so interesting, and found this so boring and void.  I have concluded the reason is that this movie is a pointless installation in moving along the story, reguardless of how the literature behind the movies set it up. <br /> <br />Overall this ends up to be boring, the plots twists are for nothing in the way of the story being advanced, the plot and story go nowhere, and this ends up being an uncomfortable waste of three hours of my life.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I saw this on HBO in the middle of the night while on vacation, and was very surprised at the depth covered in this movie. Lee is a very disturbed young woman searching for control over her life. Her actions - the self-inflicted pain, the cutting, are all symptoms of trying to gain control when so much of her life to this point has been horribly insecure. Enter Mr. Gray, her neurotic attorney boss, who is drawn to her in a way that frightens him. He also has a problem with control, and is tediously exacting in his work and in his exercise. I loved the scene where he tells her, \\"you are never to harm yourself again.\\" Apparently Lee, fresh from the world of well-meaning psychologists, has never been ordered to cease the self-harming behavior. Mr. Gray steps into the role of master and Lee begins to blossom. Lee begins to walk home, on the order of Mr. Gray, and feels more confidence as she imagines him beside her, protecting her.  The relationship continues with Mr. Gray exacting mild punishment over her small mistakes.  They are both playing a game with each other, becoming wrapped up in it. Until Mr. Gray, disgusted with himself and the escalation of their encounters, fires Lee. Again, he is attempting to get control over himself.  As he says to her when she confronts him, \\"We can't do this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!\\" It turns out that that is, indeed, what they both need. I thought the needs they both had were very well expressed in the scene where Lee confesses to cutting herself.  <br /> <br />I recommend this film to people who will not be disgusted by a sensitive look at an alternative lifestyle.
B00009L1TA|1.0|Give me a break...this is the WORST movie I have seen in decades....the plot was worked over like a skinny, underfed mule hauling refrigerators up Mt. Everest.  Two great actors WASTED in this inept \\"Flashbacks Gone Wild!!\\" airplane CRASH CRATER.  Good God!!!!!!!  The last scene of all the actors around a dining table sums up this piece of work.....looked like THEY thought this effort was some sort of joke ...having to be explained away ONE MORE FREAKN' time like this was some sort of actor's workshop roundtable discussion.  Anybody on here who thinks this movie was some sort of Gorky Park type of plot twist movie needs therapy...and lots of it....for an extended period of time until you get over yourself.  If I could have given this a MINUS 5, I would have.  I feel used and tossed aside like a cellophane wrapper into the bushes off the 405 Freeway in Van Nuys....  See this movie and like it and you, my friend, have some serious, serious personality disorder issues.
0671027387|4.0|I know it is annoying to read a review like this one, because I am going to start out by comparing \\"Deception Point\\" to another of Dan Brown's books, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". The latter is definitely better than the former for me. I found \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to be one of the best books I have ever read, but \\"Deception Point\\", although also very good, still comes up a porr second. As usual Dan Brown captivaes us with his mix of fact and fiction, explaining some very interesting scientifc and teachnical breakthroughs. He does an excellent job of simplifying science, such as the composition of meteors, without making you think that you are stuck in Geology 101. While I found the story fascinating, I did find it stretched the believable just a little to far, and the twists I have come to expect from reading the blurb on this book and reading other Dan Brown stuff just didn't have the impact and cleverness to them. Another thing that irritaed me was that as the book went on, I was finding myself skipping parts to get to the story. There is a lot of unnecesary filler to this book, and information we do't really need. Still, it is worth reading, but if you are a Dan Brown afficionade, you might be slightly disappointed by this offering.
B0002858YS|5.0|driving home one night from a party, i was listening to the radio when i heard this 4-some from vegas. their single 'somebody told me' got me hooked from the first time i heard it. but don't think i got the cd expecting every song to be like the single. i was ready for anything, and what i got was something better. 'hot fuss' is by far one of the best releases of the year. <br /> <br />only 11 tracks and just over 45 minutes, every track on the album has its moment, such as the catchy bass-line in the opening track 'jenny was a friend of mine', the dance beat to 'somebody told me', the synthesizer (yes, synthesizer) in 'on top' and the horns in 'believe me, natalie'. i guarentee at least 3 or 4 tracks will have you listening to this album for weeks or even months. <br /> <br />one of my favorite songs on the album is 'change your mind'. clocking in a little over 3 minutes, the beauty of this song is the resemblence it has to the grateful dead's all time famous song 'touch of grey'. maybe it's just me but it sounds like it. classic track. <br /> <br />what makes this album a gem is its catchy tunes and its clever lyrics written in a story fashion of heartbreak, jealousy and confusion. a definate must have.
0380789035|3.0|Gaiman certainly lays out an interesting concept, the fading old gods of European cultures being superceded by the gods of the \\"Information Age.\\" Shadow is an interesting character, but never hits his stride, although memorable in several scenes.  Although I was not looking for a neat, tidy ending, there is no conclusion to the book, just a continual drifting for the characters.  I'm interested to read Gaiman's short fiction, because he has good takes on the battle between culture and materialism, he's definitely onto something here.
0385334206|3.0|Although this book has it's high points, like Vonnegut's humorous observations about America, it isn't as good as Cat's Cradle or Slaugherhouse-Five. The reason for this is because the author literally tells you how the book ends, numerous times. Very disappointing.
0783225849|5.0|You have to be of a certain age to remember that this film was supposed to premiere on network television in 1963. That premiere was withdrawn, however, after the relative of an elected official was kidnapped right before the film was supposed to air.<br /><br />This should tell you a lot about the era and intelligence about mental illness that existed when this film came out. Everyone thought anyone that was mentally ill was going to run around killing people. That is exactly what happened in the movie. Today, we know better, I hope.<br /><br />Still, if you've never seen it, buy, rent or tune into Turner Classic Films the next time this film airs for a wallop you'll never forget. The mental illness storyline is hackneyed and out of date by new millennium standards, but this remains Hitchcock's greatest psychological masterpiece.
B000002J09|5.0|One of the best all around albums of all time.  If you appreciate the guitar and rock and don't have this album, there is something wrong with you.
0788821075|4.0|Pretty Woman: 119 minute running time, directed by Garry Marshall, Touchstone Video film, released in 1990, color picture.  Julia Roberts became America's beloved actress in this classic movie.  She won the hearts of audiences throughout the land by playing the part of a prostitute swept into a fairytale life by a wealthy business man.  The business man, played by Richard Gere, hired her to be his companion for a week while in L.A.  The otherwise cold and emotionless tycoon soon melts because of Roberts' charm and hidden natural innocence.  She goes from being on the mean streets to enjoying luxurious bubble baths in a fine hotel, shopping in the most exquisite clothing stores, and wearing dazzling jewelry at upscale parties in what seems like the blink of an eye.  Although there are a few problems due to the couples' very different backgrounds, love prevails, and they enjoy happiness beyond what either had imagined.  The movie portrays America's fascination of seeing the \\"underdog\\" win in the end, as well as the rags-to-riches story we all love so much.  That, and Julia Robert's performance, is why I give this film four stars.
B000002KHB|5.0|So many times you'd be out in public and Smoke of the Water Comes on, and so many people will say, \\"Hey, its that song.\\"  What most people don't realize is the band behind it.  Most of these people, sadly, are the youth of America, under 25.  Sadly, I'm in with that bunch, but I don't think like them.  It's horrible that so many people my age listen to rap and crap like that.  But, I can safely say, this is an album of raw rock that just might turn some of em' around.  For that, this album is great, an album of pure rock, with some cool bass solos I might add!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Before I start my review, I must say-RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.  You don't have to like it.  Rage is for fans of Hard Rock, not for fans of, lets say, Yellowcard or New Found Glory.   <br /> <br />Rage Against the Machine Recieved Awards for Best Album of the Year and Best Artist of the Year For this. <br /> <br />The Highlights on this album are Testify, Guerilla Radio, Calm Like a Bomb, Sleep Now in The Fire, and Maria.  <br /> <br />1. Testify   10/10 Very Catchy Vocals.  Very Nice Guitars, too. My Fourth Favorite. <br /> <br />2. Guerrilla Radio  10/10  Probably one of my favorite songs of all time.  Best on the album.  I have listened to this a countless number of times.  Great Solo, and Great ending. <br /> <br />3. Calm Like A Bomb 10/10  Best Guitars on the Album.  My Second Favorite. <br /> <br />4. Mic Check  7/10  This one is too boring for me to like.  Still has pretty cool guitars. <br /> <br />5. Sleep Now In The Fire 10/10 I'm Pretty Sure this was the second single.  This is such a good song to rock out to.  My 3rd Favorite <br /> <br />6. Born Of A Broken Man  8/10  Good Song with a great ending, but I just don't Like it that much. <br /> <br />7. Born As Ghosts  6/10  Ughh, Worst song on the album.  Filller. <br /> <br />8. Maria  10/10 <br /> <br />Too Lazy to review the rest.   <br /> <br />Buy This album!
6305428557|1.0|While in the throes of stomach flu, I went down to the local video store and rented this dog, hoping it would be just the thing to take my mind off feeling like utter bollocks.  The movie is billed as a comedy.  It is not.  There is absolutely nothing funny in the entire film.  Hugh Grant and his surveyor boss stumble on the scene of a Welsh town that is so deeply backward that they take grave offense at the idea of the local mountain being classified as a hill.  There is nothing funny about their primitive psychology; and indeed I felt increasingly uneasy as the animosity of the townspeople toward the English surveyors began to mount.  I could not help but feel that the population was just a hair's breadth from murder at all times.  Instead the good townspeople content themselves with permanently sabotaging the car of the surveyors.  The upright fire and brimstone local vicar has a hand in the sabotage, saying \\"Forgive them God, for they know not what they do\\" as he slashes a tire.  I find this utterly creepy.  The vicar might as well be murdering the surveyors, offering the same schismatic formula.  In the meantime, a local prostitute is brought in to ply Hugh Grant with her charms.  Romantic, isn't it?  Just as coyly funny as Johnny Shellshocked, the local war victim, becoming unglued on top of the mountain in a thunderstorm as he tries to assist in the chicanery of piling dirt on the mountaintop to augment its height.  Can anyone doubt that with their innate hatred of the English these townspeople would seize upon and murder and perhaps even cannibalize the surveyors did they not countenance the mountain's new height?  In some atavistic frenzy they would club them to death and drag their bodies through the streets.  Good Fun!
0262731541|5.0|<br /> <br />Reviewed by Dr. Andreas Fuchs, Berne, Switzerland, August 2004 <br /> <br />Long-awaited for Bicycling Science 3 is finally here: 22 years after the second edition was originally published! A main question for the reviewer was therefore: Will the 3rd edition of Bicycling Science consider the key-developments that happened in this field during the full age of the desktop computer in a wisely weighted manner? This question is a fair one since Bicycling Science ranks among the most important books in the field of cycling! <br /> <br />The new, third edition of Bicycling Science (BS) contains main chapters about: History, human power generation, thermal effects on power production, power and speed, bicycle aerodynamics, rolling (tires and bearings), braking, steering and balancing, mechanics and mechanisms (power transmission), materials and stresses, unusual human-powered machines, and human-powered vehicles in the future. <br />Compared with BS2, BS3 has relatively more content in the chapters \\"human power generation\\" and \\"steering and balancing\\". BS3 discusses relevant results of work physiology in much more detail than BS2. Since bicycling science is a wide field it is a wise decision to involve co-authors; in the \\"steering and balancing\\"-chapter Jim Papadopolous vast experience with this main topic shines up and is, at least by the reviewer, very much appreciated! <br /> <br />After reading BS3, the question put up by the reviewer at the beginning of this review receives an overall positive answer: D.G. Wilson lists many new references; as a very serious observer of the field of bicycling science Wilson identified the important developments and discusses them accordingly. The main omission detected by the reviewer is the absence of the topic \\"suspension\\" high up in the hierarchy of the chapters of the book. Also, the hydraulic actuation of brakes would have deserved a more prominent position.  <br />Apart from that, the book covers bicycling science as what it is today very well! BS, if it was an academic discipline, was defined by engineers and physicists; one focus that is therefore still missing too much is the one of human factors and ergonomics. By saying that the reviewer does not at all negatively criticize BS3... he just likes to point out a weakness in the bicycle research area for which neither D.G. Wilson nor J. Papadopoulous are responsible, of course! <br /> <br />Conclusion: The 3rd edition of Bicycling Science is a noble successor of BS2 and assures that The MTI Press's Bicycling Science remains in the top ranks in cycle literature! <br /> <br />The reviewer is physicist and is since many years actively involved in the study, development and promotion of modern forms of cycles. He could therefore be called \\"an expert\\" in the field of bicycling science. Main fields of interest are velomobiles, power-assist drives and human powered vehicles dynamics, especially aerodynamics. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a genius. In his various efforts in television and comic books, he has become a favorite of mine. So when i heard, a couple years back that is, that he was investing his formidable creative prowess in a science fiction series, I was breathless with anticipation. And of course, Whedon and his long-time partner Tim Minear did not disappoint, nor did their well-chosen, very talented cast. <br /> <br />Firefly is a science fiction western, where 500 years in the future humanity has spread across the galaxy, united under the totalitarian Alliance and its corporate arm, Blue Sun. In the future, cultures have been melded together to come up with intriguing art, fashion, and even language (the characters swear in Chinese). Our heroes are the crew of the Firefly-class transport, Serenity. They are Malcolm Reynolds, the captain and veteran of the war between his Independent faction and the Alliance; Zoe, his first mate and fellow soldier in the war; Wash, Zoe's husband and the pilot; Jayne, an amoral thief who acts as the muscle of the group; Kaylee, the mechanic, with the ability to telepathically communicate with machines; and Inara, the resident \\"companion\\" (similar to courtesans or geishas) and the ship's \\"ambassador\\". They're renegades and thieves, taking any job that pays, but things get complicated when they pick up three interesting passengers: Shepherd Book, a preacher, Simon Tam, a former doctor, and his insane sister River, who is wanted by the Alliance.  <br /> <br />The show is very well-written and well-directed, especially with Whedon behind the camera. The cast are all incredible, but the highlight is Nathan Fillion as Reynolds, who is truly incredible on screen. But unfortunately, by the time one watches all the episodes, the arc of the season is just unfolding, and is cut short by the fat cats at fox. The good news is Whedon's doing a movie. So after watching these 14 episodes, go see the movie so youcan see the story unfold. <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|First of all, One doesn't need to see KB1 in order to enjoy KB2, although I highly recommend both as exceptional films! <br /> <br />That being said...as a 'second act,' Tarantino completely makes over the 'sequel' concept, even though this isn't supposed to be a sequal, but the second half of a long film.  Since that's how Mirimax marketed it, that's how I'm callin' it.  Be that as it may, I have never seen a 'second' film so thoroughly compliment it's predecessor, yet be able to stand on it's own.  <br /> <br />This is, story-wise, infinitely better than kB1, which was essentially a live-action cartoon. (Still a phenominal work on it's own, but the two are strikingly different in terms of what they deliver to the Audience) The Bride continues her quest to Kill Bill, and along the way, character development is just in overdrive.  I would be saddened if Keith Carradine doesn't pull an Oscar Nom out of his chilling/loveable/diabolical Bill.  It is truly one of the best performances of the year, and definitely of his career.  Thurman and Hannah also turn in career-best performances.  Also Michael Madsen adds a depth of character to his assassin turned drunk that makes him freakishly empathetic. <br /> <br />This movie is abolutely gorgeous in it's cinematography as well.  Whereas KB1 was alive with color, this volumes more muted tones perfectly compliment the overwhelming multi-layers of the story and performances.  Never has a trailer in the desert looked so good! <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about this film...and once you see it, I'm sure you will feel the same.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I have everything they put out since Season's End.  MArbles is a return to the marillion sound that made them special. Solid, well produced, well written, inspired, totally worthwhile.  <br />FINAL RANK <br />1) MArbles - surprising return to form, inspired stuff in an uninspiring age. Now #1 because holidays and brave are more than 10 years old and are by now kind of worn out.  <br />2) Holidays in Eden - defines to me the \\"marillion\\" sound <br />3) Brave - at their peak <br />4) Afraid of sunlight - really cool stuff <br />5) SEason's End - sounds like a fresh band <br />6) Strange Engine - memory of water??? <br />7) Radiation - interesting but the last couple of songs are pathetic.  <br />8) Marillion.com - sounds like a bad 80's album <br />
B00006AG5N|5.0|Howdy Folks Deke Rivers here ELVIS ALOHA  <br />[...] This collection of Elvis tracks has been Totally remixed by Elvis enterprises, to bring the songs up to date with the the digital sound technology, and it works,  <br />without changing to much of the original sound it is more pleasing to the fans and those who admired Elvis such as myself through the decades. A MUST FOR ELVIS FANS ALIKE! <br />Regards Deke Rivers.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I absolutely adored the Wicked soundtrack. It is the spark plug for the entire show. The powerful vocals of Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are phenomenal. They can belt out the heartfelt lyrics in such a way that after every muscial number in the theater people would give standing ovations.Let's just say- Menzel didnt win that Tony for nothing!But Chenoweth still shines as the quirky, popular witch Glinda. My favorite songs are numbers 4,6,7,11, 12 and 16. This makes a great present to anyone, especially that broadway fanatic!!!!!!
B00004XMV6|5.0|This unrated edition of the movie version of the novel features the absolutely fine Kim Basinger; who can act, as well as look \\"hot\\".  She's one of the very few women who can move to the song \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\" and sizzle.  In fact, she can be sexier, with a facial expression, than some women can with their entire body.  What a body!  She's a fine actress, talented and beautiful.  God Bless the woman.  If the novel is anything like the film, and she brings the Elizabeth character to life.  Mickey Rourke is good too, and very lucky to have played opposite her and Carrie Otis (who's also fine in Wild Orchid), even if he's a bit of a \\"rough\\" dude.  A kind of less than respectful movie (as I'm sure women would see it) but hey, it's a \\"guys\\" movie.  I'm sure somewhere there's a movie for women that would provoke the same reaction from them.  If not, there will be.  Give us boys a break, Ok?
B000006TRV|5.0|I read all the 1-star reviews for this cd and all i can say is how off guard they were most of them went on how it was \\"Hip\\" to have it in high school but its nothing more than teenage music that should be forgotten....or another review said that this is the Roger Waters Show which i think is quite funny because i feel that this is Pink Floyds Finest Masterpiece this band deserves all they have anyways get this cd it may be pricy but its worth it my favorite songs are \\"Hey You\\" \\"Run Like Hell\\" \\"Young Lust\\" and much more
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites, its just incredible. All of the songs are great, which is rare, because these days you can't find a CD with a every song being amazing..
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|1. The Package -A good intro song; drawn out and very long, almost Tool-esque, but nice nonetheless. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. Weak And Powerless -Nice flowing song, I like the album version better than the radio one. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. The Noose -Very beautiful, flowing song. Volume progresses slowly, and I always turn it up at the beginning and end up getting my eardrums blasted by the end. One of my fave's. :) 10/10 <br />  <br />4. Blue -Nice faster paced song, nice harmonies. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Vanishing -It's stranger than the previous songs, but very enjoyable, especially towards the end. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. A Stranger -No drums or bass in this slower song, but it's very pleasing to the ear. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. The Outsider -Not one of my fav's, but still a decent song. 8/10          <br /> <br />8. Crimes -This song is just Maynard counting with random studio talking, drums and guitar in the background haha. 5/10. <br />        <br />9. The Nurse Who Loved Me -This song is a fairly demonic one, and my friends and I joke about it all the time, but it's actually very beautiful and serves its purpose. 8/10          <br /> <br />10. Pet -Heavier song, I enjoy it much though. One of my favorites on the CD. 10/10           <br /> <br />11. Lullaby -Another demonic song, just randomness haha. 5/10 <br />           <br />12. Gravity -The ultimate in closing songs, Maynard shines in this ballad. Beautiful, one of my favorites on CD. 10/10 <br />
B00006CXXU|4.0|I really love this CD - but there are a few exceptions, but over all I thought it was great.. <br /> <br />Can't Hold Us Down - a perfect 5 star song, its up beat and it has a really good message.. <br /> <br />Walk Away - It's Jazzy and long but it growed on me 4 stars <br /> <br />Fighter - You all heard it, its pretty good 4 stars <br /> <br />Infatuation - Its a good song but its too long 4 stars <br /> <br />Loving Me For Me - I don't really like it but the lyrics are pretty good 3 stars  <br /> <br />Impossible - Its pretty good 3 stars <br /> <br />Underappreciated - I like it 4 and half stars <br /> <br />Beautiful - Amazing song, amazing lyrics 5 stars <br /> <br />Make Over - I like the song - I 'd give it 4 and a half stars <br /> <br />Cruz - Inspiring lyrics and a wounderful song 5 stars <br /> <br />Soar - A great song with inspiring lyrics as well 5 stars <br /> <br />Get Mine, Get Yours - I don't really like this song but i can tolerate it for a while 3 stars <br /> <br />Dirrty - Everyone heard it - it's alright 4 stars <br /> <br />The Voice Within - I like it 4 and a half stars <br /> <br />I'm OK - I love this song - It tells us a lot about her past and the physical abuse she and her mother faced - it deserves more then 5 stars.. <br /> <br />Singing My Song - Not my favorite song 3 and a half stars
B00000JGHM|5.0|This isnt just your standard shoot em up cops and robbers film with no plot, characterization or story, Heat is close to the epitome of what a great crime thriller should be. Though this movie drags at times, you have to appreciate the detailed script presenting the lives of cops and robbers and the affects of what they do on their personal lives. Heat has probably some of the best casting is some time. Two of the best actors of their generation, and of all time..Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Star as the Relentless Cop and the cunning master thief. Both characters are a site to see...Pacinos' Hanna is Brazen and Over the top while De Niros' Macualey is calm, cold and calculating. The supporting cast is no slouch and dynamite in supporting the two leads, notable heavyweights Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Jon Voight. Casting alone could make this movie stand on its own but its the fact that it takes the implications of relentless cops and even more relentless thieves and presents the effects on the people they love. You basically root for all involved because when its all said and done, you grow to like these characters. A great masterpiece not to be missed, however the DVD is a dissapointment..I want to see some interviews and commentary!
B000089RVX|5.0|I Loved it, every song was just amazing. To me, this CD was really good because Evanescence don't focus on just being rocky, on the contrary, they have have a great slow song which was my favorite from the moment I heard, Hello, thats because the lyrics were written by them which means that the song meants something to them, thats basically why I love this group, they write their own lyrics..
B00027JZ3E|5.0|Not only is this film fun, but it is a perfect movie to reflect the time period; the clothing, the music, the speech.  I saw this movie 13 times when I was in high school and then in college we had drinking games based on the number of times Diane Wiest purses her lips.   <br />It's a must have!!
B000099T2L|3.0|There are a few nice songs on this CD but otherwise it wasn't what I expected it to be..
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I love Britney and I have faith that she will make a come back, but this CD is bad.  The reason is that she has great songs and great music with horrible overlapping sounds and voices.  If she had removed most of the back up singers and back noises this CD would rock.  For example, Outrageous is a good song, but there is this horrible guy interjecting and singing \\"na na na na na na!\\" like a child in a playground fight.  It ruins the ENTIRE song because he keeps interrupting my enjoyment of the music with his awful noises!  Most of the songs have this same problem except for Shadow and number twelve (I forgot the title) the song about Britney calling her lover her wings.  The radio stations play the Shadow song and the wing song a lot because they are just about the only new songs without any stupid noises in the background.  REMIX the album Britney and you can fix it.
B00005JN2X|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie today, just because we were bored and were hanging out.  I really didn't expect much from the film.  The movie trailer, out of context, wasn't that good, but when you see it in the movie, it was really good. Foxx did a great job (and that whole scene from the trailer was great), and this was the best I've seen Tom Cruise.  <br /> <br />There aren't many DVDs I would buy, but I can't wait to buy this one.  <br /> <br />Very good movie.
0783225792|5.0|When I first saw this film at the theatre I was disappointed as I compared it to Goodfellas and found it inferior.  That is a totally inadequate way to judge it, however.  Well, now, after numerous viewings, I have to admit that if Goodfellas is a 10, Casino is a 9.  The plot is suberb and De Niro and Pesci are as perfect in this film as in any other.  Interestingly, the hatred one feels for Sharon Stone's character may be the best proof of the diamond (intentional plot reference there) performance she puts forth.  Unbelievable.  The cast is superb and this is one of Martin Scorsese's finest productions.  I was incredibly impressed and remain that way today.
0156027321|5.0|There are some people that we meet that change us as a person.  These are the people that overcome life's insurmountable obstacles and stay true to what they believe at all costs.  This is the Life of Pi by Yann Martel.   <br /> <br />The Life of Pi is by no means a traditional adventure story.  Rather than searching for adventure, Pi's adventure is thrust upon him in a very unfortunate way.  To me, Pi's adventure at sea is more of a backdrop for Pi's adventure to find himself.  Both the spiritual and physical adventure of Pi are remarkable, admirable, and classic.   <br /> <br />The journey that Pi takes is also a story about the darker sides of life: the struggle to survive, dealing with death, and necessary savagery.  These themes are interspersed with some needed, but not detracting, humor.  It all fits well together, as do the lead up to the journey and the post-journey.  The Life of Pi is truly mesmerizing.  Pi's story is amazing, a masterpiece of fiction in so many ways.  Enjoy.
B00004RF83|5.0|FREDRIC MARCH headlines this disturbing and rather contemporary thriller by FRANKENHEIMER.<br /><br />Gardner, Douglas and the never disappointing Burt Lancaster neatly round-out this nailbiter.  LOTS of disturbing moments ... What IS the military doing in Arizona?  A hidden base?  Alternate agendas?

0312995423|3.0|Dan Brown does know how to write an interesting novel with good plot turns and twists but it is always cookie cutter. His novels involve a intelligent professeur, beautiful and smart woman and some kinds of codes that need to be and always are broken. Also the person who is a friend to the woman and professeur is always the \\"bad guy\\". Still as predictable as it is it still keeps you capivated to the storyline. This book was the same way except at the end where I got the answer to the  code a full 20 pages before the characters. And as in all of his books there are inaccuracies such as not knowing there are 8 bits in a character rather than 1. All in all I still would recommend this book to anyone who loves a thriller.
B00007GZQI|4.0|This piece of work is definitely suitable for people who enjoy watching films from the psychedelic-hippie era. Because that is exactly what it is.  <br /> <br />I never really expected much from this movie but unlike some other films now, it has a clear but ridiculous plot.  <br /> <br />My favourite parts would have to be Ringo looking up at Peter Sellers and saying \\"Father\\" with that goofy expression on his face and his delectable Liverpudlian accent. Another would be Yul Bryner singing in drag. And finally, seeing Laurence Harvey perform Hamlet's \\"To be or not to be\\" soliloquy in a striptease version. Bare bodkin indeed!
B000003TAR|5.0|First of all, MasterShake, you're an dumba$$. Pardon my language. Puddle of Mudd was way after Nirvana's time. Hell, Kurt probably could've babysat for them around that time. Not taking anything away from Puddle of Mudd but Nirvana is, was, and will always be better. I've read your other reviews too saying that Alice in Chains is a rip off of Godsmack and once again... AIC was before Godsmack's time. Now i don't know if you wrote the review to be an a$$ but that's the kind of stuff we don't need on the boards. You give your honest opinion and know your facts before you post. Anyways, In Utero IS the best Nirvana album beating out the commercialized Nevermind. Nevermind is also a great album but In Utero's grungy and gritty sound of guitars and the thunderous drums on songs like \\"Serve the Servants\\" and \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" make In Utero one of the best albums of the 90's.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is back in full form with \\"Kill Bill: Volume 1.\\"  Just when you think he cannot surprise you any more--he does.  Even though he acknowledges the fact that the film is inspired by various genres of film that he loves, such as Spaghetti Westerns, Kung-Fu flicks and Samurai pictures, you can tell that this movie has his name written all over it.  Action packed and often times very funny, this is a movie that delivers again and again.<br /><br />\\"The Bride\\" (we do not know her real name until the second volume) has been left for dead by the very people she has worked for when it is apparent that she wanted to settle down and have a family.  They made a big mistake, as she survived and is looking for payback with absolute determination.  She has made a list of the people who are responsible for her supposed death, and she plans to take them head on without any fear.  Armed with a sword and an undeniable craving for vengeance, she will not stop until they are all dead... including Bill.  The first volume's main focus is on what has brought her to the beginning of the movie and the events that have fueled her thirst for blood.<br /><br />The main thing I always enjoy about Tarantino is that you never know what to expect from his movies.  He has never recycled his act and is always looking for fresh and unique ideas.  True is the fact that the movie is inspired by certain genres of film that has made him the avid film lover that he is today, but he is able to add his own and personal touch to it all.  Very much like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" he plays around with time to tell a very simple story, which really helps us to believe that there is more to it all.  The writing is smart and terrific, and his direction is absolutely flawless.  Uma Thurman really shows that she can be an action hero, but she also is able to add a human quality to her character.  Lucy Liu is also great in her role and gives a very chilling performance.<br /><br />The movie is very violent, so it's not for the squeamish.  The levels of violence differs from time to time.  There are times when it is very goofy and purposely over the top, and resembles something you'd see in a low budget horror flick.  Then there are times when the violence is very real and will make you cringe a little.  However, if you are a long time fan of Tarantino's films, then you should have no problems with the film.  The DVD has a few goodies to offer, but not a whole lot.  It's sad, because I know they will re-release these two movies with more extras and special features.  I don't blame Tarantino for this, though.  This reeks of Miramax's doing.  Still, it is a good DVD.  The picture and sound quality is more than excellent.  Extras that are included are a making of feature, musical performances and trailers.  The making of feature is definitely a recommended feature to check out.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill: Volume 1\\" shows us that Quentin Tarantino has not lost his touch.  Even though this is only the first part, it is still a standout film.  The last few minutes leave us begging for more, but we are still very satisfied in the end.  Filled with lots of dazzling action sequences, a great cast and a smart script, this is one enjoyable flick that you won't want to miss out on.  Think you've seen it all from Tarantino?

078401115X|5.0|Aah, Mr Rourke, where did it all go horribly wrong?  If you saw him and his feakish dog in Once Upon A Time In Mexico, you will know all what I mean.  Flashback to the 80s and Mickey Rourke was so sexy and expressive that the TV tended to start melting.... <br /> <br />Angel Heart is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen.  Hand on heart.  Wonderfully photographed to give the sensation of menace in even the simplest frame, this frantic race to find the true identity of a 'missing' crooner becomes one of the most sinister premises ever penned with corking performances all round. <br />Robert DeNiro gives a spine tingling performance as the 'eater of souls' (you'll never eat a boiled egg again, trust me) and Lisa Bonet is sweetly sexual and innocent all at once. <br /> <br />The film's main backdrop are the equally dusty and drenched environs of America's Deep South, with colours as musty and dark as an attic full of loved and forgotten toys.  The volatile and intense fear of Voodoo permeates almost every scene as the body count grows and so does Rourke's bewildered frustration and mental anguish until breaking point.  His performance is near perfect, possibly only beaten by his turn in Rumblefish.  He wastes not a minute of screen time with overblown hystronics but takes the viewer on a rollercoaster journey that is advisable to be experienced several times. <br /> <br />Of course, the actors had great material to work with. It may be that I am a bit slow on the uptake (though I can generally see a plot line a mile off) but I was genuinely pleased that this film baffled me right to the end.  While not generally 'scary', the tension, the psychological drama of Angel Heart will have you gripped and when the credits roll, you'll still be hanging onto the arm of the couch.  It's that sudden, that draining. <br /> <br />If there's one downside, is that Mr Rourke tends to think he looks better naked.  Baby, you don't.  It's all in the face and the voice.  Watch out for wobbling arse, bleeding walls....

0790729644|2.0|It's extremely common in fiction writing to have the characters undergo personality changes from the beginning of the story to the end.  This movie just takes that concept to its logical extreme, where every one of the three main characters turns out to be the opposite of what they first appeared to be.  It's just too predictable.  It's also just dull.  The whole \\"English Bob\\" storyline serves no purpose at all, I find it puzzling why a story would throw in what appears to be a main character, only to then shut him down completely and have him ridden out of town on a rail. It's to show how mean Gene Hackman's character is,  but it could have been done much better and with much less wasted time.  The writer who seems to be in the movie only for comic relief is another waste of time.  He's not really funny, just predictable.  Just another character undergoing personality changes, from naive writer to experienced opportunist.  And the ending wasn't nearly as satisfying as just about any other Eastwood film you care to mention.  It was too concerned with Clint's character's personal journey from responsible, hard-working pig farmer to whiskey drinking gunslinger to worry much about impact.  In short, it was like reading a very long novel where the whole climax is on the very last page of the book.  If we read a thousand page book, we need at least a 100 page ending, not something so quick as this.  Considering all the time that's been spent delving into every facet of Hackman's character, he wasn't really much of a player in the end.  Just another guy.  It had a real deus ex machina feel to it - they spent the whole movie showing Clint as an old (62 years old in  real life, and he looked it) pig farmer who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a six shooter, then at the end, well, lets just say all that character establishment didn't have anything to do with the ending.  The only character development seemed to come from taking up whiskey drinking again, which improves one's reflexes and aim apparently.  There are the usual quotes, \\"I don't deserve this\\", \\"Deservin' ain't got nothin' to do with it\\", but after sitting through this long dull thing, they don't have the usual impact.<br /><br />I have to agree with the others who have said that all the awards this movie gathered are more of a lifetime achievement award for Clint.  He deserves them for a lot of movies he's made, but certainly not this one.  This isn't nearly as good as Josey Wales, Pale Rider, etc.  The pacing is entirely fouled up, the characters are stock, almost cliched (especially Morgan Freeman), There's certainly nothing here that we haven't seen before on a hundred episodes of Gunsmoke.roves one's reflexes and aim apparently.

B00005K3OT|5.0|When you first see the beginning, you are not sure what to expect from this movie.  This movie is great because it does not promote violence or sex or anything like that that most of the other movies these days promote.  It is simple, elegant, and a complex story.  All the actors play their roles to perfection.  I highly recemend this movie for anyone looking for some innocent and interesting entertainment.
B000002HIK|2.0|this cd was richard d james before he met tom jenkinson, you can really tell. He is constantly looping. not developing tune. doing downbeat electronics. the only thing good about this cd was the bad ass filter on the drums. besides that there really was nothing to it.
B000002GK1|5.0|there are few albums that come close to equaling this album.  the lyrics on here are out of this world.  chris cornell and eddie vedder are the greatest lyricists of all time, and this record displays that.  there are many haunting and disturbing songs on this album, and as with all of cornell's lyrics they are very dark and depressing.<br /><br />the addition of bass player ben shepherd brought a lot of the new sound heard on this record.  he and matt cameron show off the power of their rythm section on the track \\"slaves and bulldozers,\\" on which we hear chris belt out notes that would make your head explode.  the guitar work is incredible, and kim thayil's unbelievable playing is supplimented by cornell's.<br /><br />to me, songs like \\"jesus christ pose\\" commented a lot on the society at the time, and on the hype of the scene.  listen to the track \\"searching with my good eye closed\\" and try not to be emotionally moved in some way.  the lyrics are incredible and will only get better on superunknown...
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Stephen Sommers (writer and director) creates another blockbuster hit along with the \\"Mummy\\" movies. The movie, Van Helsing takes you and the audience on a wild rollercoaster ride. The storyline takes place during the late 1880s in Transylvania. Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides have ruled over the land for many years. Meanwhile, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) and his assistant, Carl (David Wenham) travel to this forbidden land and they are sent to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last of the Valerious family. Together, they fight against Dracula and even the Wolfman, who is Anna's brother, Velkan (Will Kemp). They also meet Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley), who they need to help protect from Dracula, so that his plan fails. Besides the story along, there are many HUGE special effects, and even some sad and secret surprises. Sommers makes the audience see the Universal monsters reborn before your very eyes. This movie is the best summer blockbuster starter of the year!
B00005N5RM|4.0|Despite the modest budget, The Blob (1988) is a smartly crafted flick that comprehends the relationship between horror and comedy. With self-effacing in-jokes, clever shocks, and superb effects, it delivers the goods in the form of a genuinely scary film that's eager to have fun with its B-movie premise. Sprinkle in false expectations about characters (to misdirect those who've seen the McQueen version) and you've got a movie with some surprises up its sleeve, a movie that works better in some respects than the original. Today, it puts one in mind of a better X-Files episode. Not to be missed by genre aficionados.
0312995423|4.0|I picked it up in the morning and finished it late that afternoon.  It kept my attention non-stopped.  It was a fast paced thriller which thoroughly entertained.  Those seeking profound litterature, stay away.  It's simply meant to amuse.  I love the way it switched constantly from seen to seen.  It helped keep my attention.  There was always a new twist.  You feel like you just got off a roller coaster in the end.
0156029065|5.0|Umberto Eco at his irreverent best!  His protagonist is an italian peasant who claims to be an adopted son of the Holy Roman Emperor and a Ministerial of Frederick Barbarossa.  Baudolino is a liar, a professional liar.  He has made his reputation by lying.  So can we believe him? <br /> <br />As with the main Character in Peter Carey's \\"Illywhacker\\" we find ourselves being drawn into Baudolino's web of deceit, because it is so entertaining.  We really want to believe, despite the fact that he tells us it is all lies.  Want to find the holy grail, it's here, along with the elusive kingdom of Prester John, the Head of John the Baptist, a hammer belonging to Moses, the Shroud of Turin, most of the major relics of the Christian Church, made to order by Baudolino and his gang of thieves. <br /> <br />Philosophy and religious debate created at will with the assistance of Hashhish and wine.  Unicorns, Satyrs and a host of impossible creatures, all made believable and wildly funny.  From the opening chapter where he tries to capture a Unicorn, Baudolino is a really funny book, which at the same time addresses many of the key themes of 13th Century Europe.  A really good read.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|If you like mellow, well-orchestrated alternative rock, I dare you to not get addicted to this album.  I downloaded it from iTunes, and then decided after a few days that I had to have a hard copy just in case something awful happened to my laptop and iPod (liner notes and bonus DVD are also a plus).   <br /> <br />So, yes, it's so good that I bought the album twice AND consider it money well spent. <br /> <br />A guitar-based outfit, Rouse's voice is mellow, sweet, and boyish without being cloying or saccharine.  His band is amazing, and I highly recommending seeing this act live--they are even better in person!  No musical deadweight here.  Solid harmonies, rhythmic juxtapositions, and interesting chordal voicings are especially of interest. <br /> <br />This album should be an all-time top-10 for driving down the California coast in the summertime.
0316168815|4.0|Im glad I finally gave in and read this!  The book is about a 14 year old girl (Suzie) who is raped and murdered by a neighbor.   She is then in heaven (altough I interpreted it as a heaven thats like purgatory) and is looking down on her family and friends as everyone struggles to come to terms with her death and move on. Suzie seems to become as obsessed with the living as some of the living become obsessed with her death.  The author did an excellent job of showing how people react differently to losing a loved one.  Her family is torn apart.  Her father simply is unable to move on, her mother turns to an affair to help her forget and eventually abandons the family, etc.  The authors depiction of heaven is kind of unique. I wouldnt say its a purgatory as in your punished and you have to wait until youre admitted to heaven, but more like a transition point where you still have to learn and grow before you  utlimately end up in a heaven thats more like the traditional heaven you hear about. Many of the characters and twists in this book were odd and Im not sure if it added anything to the story but I really enjoyed it none the less.  I was planning on reading this book for a long time however I was browsing through some of the customer reviews on amazon.com and it put me off wanting to read it.  Some of the reviews made it sound as though the murder and rape scenes were very detailed and gruesome. When I actually just gave in and read the book I found that the actual murder and rape was only about a page long and yes it says she was raped but it wasnt gorey detailed depscriptions as the reviews lead me to believe. Overall I felt that the book was pretty interesting and had a good plot.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Pay no attention to the opinions of semi-literates, or their landlords. This is quite a decent film - hardly groundbreaking stuff, but not just the takeoff of The Matrix/Bladerunner that you might expect. The camerawork was excellent, interesting use of light and shadow to illustrate the bleak setting. The acting was decent, the plot not completely predictable. Most amazingly of all, the fight scenes actually included (what I thought were) some unique elements, quite an achievement when so much has been done already by the Matrix etc. The irony of characters, supposedly incapable of emotion, shouting at each other and banging furniture with rage etc was obviously lost on the director, but this is my only gripe. Worth seeing.
B000025RX4|5.0|MAN, THIS ALBUM IS SO GREAT. STARTING WITH THE AWESOME \\"GUESS I'LL GO AWAY\\". THIS 'BILL SMITH' GUY DOESNT HAVE A CLUE. SCREW YOU MAN! THIS ROCKS!
B00011RPB0|5.0|The setting: Tokyo - huge, unfeeling, plastic - a metaphor for the world we live in.  The male protagonist:  urbane, funny and accomplished, but at a lonely stage in his life, where he feels impotent and unimportant.  The female protagonist:  bright but just starting her adult live, in a marriage which cannot work.  Insomniacs, they meet, and give each other a feeling of importance in a world where no one cares.  The depth of feeling as portayed in the script and by the actors is stunning.  I immersed myself in this movie in wonder.  This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
B000063DGC|5.0|I love this album.  It captures an old master with his new disciples at their peak.  There was a lot of controversy between the Blizzard and Sabbath camps about Ozzy's live vocal prowess, on \\"Tribute\\" the Ozz man proves he's got the power (same goes for \\"Speak of the Devil\\").  When I first heard \\"Tribute\\" I was a bit shocked... I had heard this show before (here come the \\"LIAR\\"s, and the \\"BULLS@#T MAN\\"s.  True fact: this show was broadcast on the King Biscuit Flower Hour back in 1981, prior to the release of \\"Diary of a Madman,\\" and gave those of us Pavlovian hounds of hell thirsting for the new Ozzy material something to continue salivating about (albeit the band only did two songs from \\"Diary\\").  I heard the full concert (sans \\"No Bone Movies\\") on the radio on Guam at the age of 13, and to this day I remember listening in awe, and trying to visualize the stage show as Ozzy plodded about rousting the crowd, and Randy blazed through effortless riff and flawless solo, while Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo held the beast together with a backbone of pure metal.  As we know, it all ended too damn soon.   <br />I just thought I'd throw this bit of trivia out to everyone.  Anyone else remember this concert on King Biscuit?
B00008EYA5|3.0|I saw S.W.A.T. in the theater after reading Roger Ebert's 3-star review of the film, and I was expecting to be a lot more intrigued and excited by the film than I actually was. Seeing it again recently more or less confirmed my initial reactions. The first half of this movie is the better half, since the training sequences---particularly the fake-airplane-hostage sequence---are interesting enough. But then Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) blurts out his offer for all lowlifes to try to break him out of handcuffs for a million dollars, and it is then that the movie begins to sink into generic, rather unmemorable action fare. Mr. Ebert said that the action scenes in the second half of S.W.A.T. are \\"more or less believable,\\" and he has a point (he usually does). On its own terms, the action scenes are reasonably well-directed by Clark Johnson. But you know what? Sheer believability does not necessarily make for exciting action, and though I'll concede that the action is well-done, I never found it terribly interesting or exciting either. The characterizations of the script and the performances by the cast certainly don't help matters. Even Samuel L. Jackson seems to be on autopilot in this movie (which was the biggest disappointment of all, since I usually love watching Jackson perform onscreen), and though the script is partly at fault for the characters' dullness, I wish the actors had been imaginative enough to bring some semblance of a spark to these otherwise generic characters. Instead, the cast merely seems like a group of actors in search of a paycheck. In short, S.W.A.T. is hardly a terrible movie, but for those looking for true action fireworks, look elsewhere (maybe even the old TV show, if this movie really truly makes you curious about it).
B00004WGAI|5.0|Wonderful movie! Excellent adaptation of the classic of the orphaned teacher who fell for the seemingly cold yet altruistic Mr. Rochester. You could honestly feel the love between the two. Highly recommended!
0064407667|5.0|I have always been a fan of books that are different and this book is one of those. Right at the beginning, we know that this book isn't going to be full of happy events. It's stated very clearly. Also there are clever use of words. Some if the are subtle jokes which some readers may not pick up on right away. I also that throughout the book many words are given definitions. If i were a teacher and my class was reading this book i would pull out the words that are defined in this book and use them as vocabulary. Another thing i though was fun about this book is that the youngest Baulelaire, Sunny (who is an infant) says things. Most of what she says aren't real words but these non-sense words are given a meaning which make the book fun to read. In addition, this book is an easy read. For anyone looking for something to have fun with, to read to their child, to have their child read this is one of those books. I hope that the next one is just as fun and just as clever as this one has been.
0141301155|4.0|Sometimes I wonder what the ratio of children who read this book before seeing the movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" is to children who saw the movie before reading the book.  In my own personal case, I first met with the works of Roald Dahl by watching the movie in my elementary school.  The scene where Violet blows up like a blueberry haunts my nightmares to this day, I might add.  It was only after I saw the film that I began to wonder about the book.  Was it better?  Worse?  About the same?  So I picked it up, read it through, and found it to be an entirely different beastie than the film altogether.  I shouldn't have been surprised, I suppose, but I was.  Though there's an underlying creepiness to both the film and the book, the book also has a wide-eyed innocence about it that is virtually impossible to capture on the silver screen.  Reading the book yet again today I am amazed by the story's capacity to reach into the minds of children and display before their wondering eyes a tale that praises the one item all kids love and all adults once coveted:  CANDY.<br /><br />Charlie Bucket lives with his mother, father, and four grandparents in a shoddy shack on the edge of town.  The family is ridiculously poor and there is little money available for such treats as candy or chocolate.  This is especially unfortunate for Charlie because he loves the stuff.  Worse still (or better, depending on how you look at it), Charlie lives in the same town as the fabulous Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory.  One day, the owner of the factory, the mysterious Willy Wonka, offers a contest for the children of the world.  He has hidden five golden tickets in some of his candy bars.  Those lucky people who find the tickets will get a special tour of the chocolate factory (a place where no one's allowed in or out under normal circumstances) and a lifetime supply of chocolate.  Four absolutely horrid children find the tickets first and then, by a stroke of providence, Charlie finds one himself.  With his Grandpa Joe in tow the two join the other kids and parents as they take a wild ride within the marvelous chocolate factory itself.<br /><br />If nothing else, Dahl taps into the best possible candy ideas an author has ever concocted.  Author J.K. Rowling has come up with some pretty cool candies, it's true.  But for sheer breadth and imagination, Dahl cannot be beat.  This book contains everything from hot ice creams for cold days to cavity-filling caramels (\\"no more dentists\\").  In his typically ridiculous fashion the villains of the piece are one and all horrid to the end.  Of course, of the different sins each child exhibits, the sin of chewing gum is probably the oddest.  I can only assume it was added to the crew because the plot takes place in a candy factory and it's a convenient flaw to exploit.  Just the same, wouldn't picking your nose be worse?  And lead to all sorts of amusing punishments?<br /><br />The cruelty of the book is there, true.  But unlike the movie, the kids in this story definitely leave the plant alive and, if not well, at least wiser.  Willy Wonka himself is endowed with a kind of delightful naivet&eacute;.  He honestly tries to stop each child before he or she does something stupid and/or dangerous.  Charlie himself is sort of an Oliver Twist type, complete with a saintly demeanor and countenance.  All in all, I found the whole book to be great.  I do wish I hadn't seen the movie first, but sometimes things like that are just unavoidable.<br /><br />Now, if you're going to read a version of this tale, I highly suggest that you do NOT get the original 1964 edition.  This was the version I read recently and boy oh boy do those Oompa-Loompas catch you by surprise.  In the original version they were black pigmies from the, \\"deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had ever been before\\".  Even the illustrations (originally created by Joseph Schindelman) show a variety of happy laughing pigmies.  Someone must have complained to Mr. Dahl though, because if you look at the 1973 reprint, all the Oompa-Loompas have been magically transformed from black pigmies to small white hippies.  Entire sections of the book have been rewritten, including an entirely new section talking about \\"hornswogglers\\" and \\"snozzwangers\\" which never appeared in the original book.  Now, of course, the illustrator of choice is the illustrious Quentin Blake.  His pictures contain wholly different images of the Oompa-Loompas and the new text has been kept.  Better yet, the newest edition of \\"Charlie\\" has an interview with Mr. Dahl at the back of the book.  Be sure to read the part where he talks about how the 1930s were the \\"glorious and golden decade\\" of chocolate.  I can't vouch that this section exists in the paperback edition, however.  Only the hardcover version with the chocolate colored cover.<br /><br />In the end, what you get out of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" depends on what you put into it.  If you go into this book expecting some sort of novelization of the film, you're going to end up sorely disappointed.  If instead, however, you go in hoping for a book that effectively makes every reader's mouth water for Wonka's fabulous creamy candies and has a pretty good story to boot, go no further.  It's a great story with a delightful dark side that kids will love and certain kids of adults will hate.  A true children's classic.ng pigmies.

B00004SZWD|5.0|I've had this CD for about a week now and I just can't get enough of it. I was born 3 months after it was originally released, and I know that many of these songs were ingrained into my subconsious all through my youth. As a result, many of these songs come off as 'vaguely familiar' friends.  <br /> I've become a HUGE Stevie Wonder fan recently, spending the last few months digesting MOMM, Talking Book, Innervisions and FFF. I'd done research and was well aware of the hype surrounding Key Of Life. I wondered if the actual CD would live up to the hype. <br /> As soon as I listened to it, it exceeded my wildest expectations. Like other double CD's that I own and love including The Beatles White Album and Genesis' Lamb Lies Down On Broadway there is A LOT of music and A LOT of information to digest....but, it took no time for me to be sucked into this masterwork. <br /> Because there are so many songs, I figured there would be a few clunkers....but to my surprise the entire CD is very consistent and listenable from beginning to end. I tend to listen to disc 1 about 3 times consecutively and then do the same with disc 2, then back to disc 1...etc. <br /> I read an online review where some fella' said that aside from Sir Duke and I Wish, the rest of the album sounded sterile and flat. Now, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but my opinion is that if all you do is zone in on the 'hit singles' and funk tunes then you're totally missing out on the full scope of Stevie's talent as a songwriter, musician and singer. But, that's on you. There are plenty of gems here even without Duke and Wish. <br /> I was especially surprised at Contusion. It caught me off guard. Being a fan of 70's Jazz Fusion (RTF, Mahivishnu..etc) it was amazing to hear Stevie's take on that style. Impressive. <br /> MY only complaint is that George Benson wasn't given a solo spot in Another Star. I keep thinking 'How're you gonna' have George Benson guest on a track and not have him take a full fledged solo?'...oh well...it's all good.
1572701137|5.0|This riveting tale of fear, suspicion, and love opens as the unnamed narrator reminisces about her former home, the grand English estate, Manderley.  She had been young and shy, a lady's companion, when she met the wealthy recent widow, Maxim de Winter, fell in love with him, and married him in a matter of weeks.  They returned to his home, where she was immediately overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running the house and dealing with her forbidding housekeeper as well as the memory of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca.  She had been beautiful, sophisticated, and supremely confident, and the narrator felt lost and helpless in comparison.  Her new husband was strangely distant to her, until a horrible secret was revealed that would change their lives and the very existence of Manderley.<br /><br />Daphne Du Maurier has crafted a wonderfully spooky story with remarkably little action, but a great deal of atmosphere and a steadily mounting feeling of impending doom.  The ravishing Rebecca is never seen, and yet she is the main character, dominating the story with her passions and cruelty.  Another main \\"character\\" is the great house itself, which is described in such fascinating detail that I felt as if I had walked its long hallways, descended its grand stairs, and had tea in the library.  The narrator is purposely kept anonymous to contrast her with the larger-than-life Rebecca, and Maxim is a seriously flawed but lovable man.<br /><br />Anna Massey does not just read the story, she performs it, delighting the listener with her upper-class British accent, giving a different voice to each character.  I happily recommend this audio cassette version of Rebecca to those who enjoy exciting tales of suspense, psychological dramas, and mysteries.
6305508550|5.0|This movie and its chararcters could have been straight out of my office. The condescending supervisor, the impromptu lay-off centered-meetings between  employees, the copier/equipment that subsequently has my permanent footmarks on it. (I wish I could take it out to a field!). We even have \\"specialists\\" come in every now and again... come to think of it, what happened to the guy who sat behind me? For those who haven't worked in a cubicle, this is an excellent preview of what office work is like. And for all of us who live this movie everyday.. lets just take another hour to stare at our screens.. and look busy.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This is Avril's sophmore effort, and im glad it finally came out. I was a very tiny bit dissapointed. Its still really good, almost great, but Let Go is 5 1/2 times better. Avril, you can do better. OK, lets get things started. \\"Dont Tell Me\\" is the first single which im sure almost everyones heard. It didnt get enough radio play, but it got enough to make it to the top 15, and even the top 25 on Billboard. \\"My Happy Ending\\" is the 2nd single, which is surely one of the best songs on the album. Its another relationship song. Its currently blowing up on Pop radio. I hope it does alot better than \\"Dont Tell Me\\". \\"He Wasnt\\" is the best song on the album. Its a really fun pop-punk track, and it does sound pretty punky. She raps/talks again for a little bit on the bridge, and just 2 short verses. It couldve been a little longer, but I still love it the way it is. \\"How Does It Feel\\" is a really nice ballad that will make you feel different from your boyfriend/girlfriend, as she says on the chorus: \\"How does it feel to be/different from me/are we the same how does it feel\\". Isnt it obvious? \\"Nobody's Home\\" Is a great light and hard track that will be the next single. Its one of my favorites. \\"Fall To Pieces\\" has to be the worst song on the album, and it sounds like it shouldnt have been in place. Same as \\"Freak Out\\", although it does have its moments. \\"Slipped Away\\" is the last song on the album that is dedicated to her dead grandfather. I thought it said Grandma, but I read wrong.

1400031362|3.0|Precious Ramotswe has more than her clients' problems to solve in the third book of this series.  Her detective agency is not doing well financially, and her fiance, Mr. Matekoni, has two lazy apprentices who are not helping him much with his car repair business.  Added to this, Mr. Matekoni himself is behaving in a very strange manner.  Rather than fire her secretary, Precious instead promotes her and puts her in charge of running both the car repair business and the detective agency.  For some reason, which is not well explained in the book, Mma Makutsi is wildly successful in running the businesses and motivating the apprentices.  Mr. Matekoni is shuffled off to the local orphanage (which makes no sense) to try to recover from his problem.  His absence is keenly felt in the book and part of the interest is lost because he and Precious have very little interaction in this installment.  Also there are some subplots which are weak or which go nowhere (such as Mma Makutsi's ill brother and the strange boy who is found in the wilderness.)  The book is at its best when Mma Ramotswe is trying to solve the mystery of a Government Man's relative who is being poisoned, and Mma Makutsi investigates the moral character of four beauty pageant contestants.  These plot lines show the delightful tongue-in-cheek spirit which have made these books so popular.
B00005JMUA|3.0|True... my anticipation was sky high. You might venture to  guess that my expectation levels were the reason for only 3 stars. Well, while watching I kept thinking that the movie is about to nova into a fantastic fight scene like Vol 1 did so often.  The amazing scenes never did materialize and at the end I felt kinda shorted.  I started wondering if it had a smaller budget that the first.  Crazy idea for a fan, but business wise it would be a good guess that the movie would do great at the box office because of volume 1.  I went over to the imdb site (Movie Info site) to see if I could find the stats...well, my guess was correct.  Volume 1 had a 55 million dollar budget and volume 2's budget was only 30 million.  That is nearly half the first film.  Well, if some of you felt a little slighted and thought perhaps it was your expectation level, well, you are right! Chop the budget of any sequel in half and see if you still get the same results.   Too bad the tickets weren't half price or the DVD price was not chopped in half.  Oh well, I am sure that it will do great in the long run, because so many of us were already committed from volume 1. I wish in the future, when you have a hit, don't try and make a few dollars in front, because in the long run, you might be stealing from yourself.  Anyway, I thought somebody had to know.
B0002IU988|3.0|Mark Tremonti finally did it. He got to right every song, play tons of solo's and be referred to on a first name basis in the albums liner notes cause he is so important. He even named the band! All that aside he is a great, great guitar player but even he can't solo over this bland record. At least he got to totally run the show, he deserves that much after putting up with Scotty Stapp all those years. I think this record would be outstanding if Tremonti just went ahead and sang also. 3 stars for a great guitar rock cd, but I just can't give it 5.
0743454529|5.0|Once you start this it will be hard to put down.  It grabs you right quick and doesn't let go.  The topic is timely, controversial, well researched and well written.  You will continue to think about the characters in this book long after the last page is read.<br /><br />It is about a family of five - a couple with 3 children, 2 teen girls and one boy.  One of the girls has a terminal illness and the book addresses how each person in the family is dealing with this crisis in their life, and how the choices that they individually make affect each other.<br /><br />Each chapter looks at one person's point of view.  The writing is emotional, yet humorous when it needs to be, and skillfully connects the reader with the characters in this controversial real-life subject.<br /><br />It sweeps you along to its shocking conclusion.  Don't miss this one!
B000068R1X|4.0|as we all know, this was the first album with guitarist jake e. lee. with the death of randy rhoads, ozzy invovled more keyboard sounds and developed a little more 'pop'ish sound. <br /> <br />Bark at the Moon (10/10): no matter how many times ive heard it and how cliche it is, i still love it. jake puts in a good riff, and i love that howl at the end :) <br /> <br />You're no Different (10/10): im not really a fan of ozzy/black sabbath ballads, but this song just has this effect on me, and i just love the sound of jakes guitar and ozzy's eerie voice. <br /> <br />Now you see it, Now you Dont (6/10): admittedly weak, i usually skip this track when im listening to the album. <br /> <br />Rock and Roll Rebel (9/10): pretty good, once again a fair riff and interesting lyrics. the lyric sheet that comes with the album has several full lines that are inncorrect in almost every song, and that shows up twice here (thats got nothing to do with the quality of the song). <br /> <br />Centre of Eternity (9/10): the freaky beginning with the tolling church bell and choir slowly starts off, soon melding into the keyboard/organ sound, then into the furious sound of jakes guitar. ozzy sings quite quickly on this one. also has a kick ass riff. <br /> <br />So Tired (10/10): i cant explain why i like this song, as ive said before, im not really into that soft, mainstream sound of ozzy, but i just cant get enough of this one. quite good! <br /> <br />Slow Down (9/10): heavy reliance on the keyboards here, as between every line in the chorus there is some sort of keyboard sound, but overall it seems to fit into the song quite well. <br /> <br />Waiting for Darkness (10/10): Ohhhhhhhh! this song kicks serious ass! without the keyboard here, this song would have been crap, but the eerie sound over and over again just fits perfectly into the sound. one of my favourites :) <br /> <br />Spiders (8/10): one of the bonus tracks, as this didnt make the final cut onto the album. there are somepretty boring/predictable lyrics here, but the best part once again has to be the screeching spider-like sound of jake e. lee's guitar. <br /> <br />One up the B Side (8/10): also a bonus track. the only good thing is the great guitar sound. the thing that annoys me the most is....what the hell is ozzy singing about? yeah, i can understan him, but what the heck is 'one up the b side' supposed to mean??  <br /> <br />OVERALL: overall this is a good album, certainly not one of his best, but it seems to capture the whole 80's pop ozzy theme (ugh). jake e. lee is quite good, but is unfortunatly last place when it comes to ranking the best of ozzy's guitarists (1. randy rhoads, 2. zakk wylde...) if you are a new starter to ozzy, PLEASE start with either Blizzard of Ozz, No Rest for the Wicked or Diary of a Madman.
B00000055E|3.0|This album has a lot of gems and hidden jewels, showcasing some of Pac's greatest material.  It is obvious that 2pac was in a zone when he was making these songs.  You can just feel his energy as he raps non stop from verse to hook to verse to hook as he does on most of the songs on this album.  This collection was put together after 2pac died so it's more of a collection of songs than an album per se, but there was something unique about Pac's spirit when making most of these songs that provides a cohesive force of sorts that makes it all fit together well.  It seems as if Pac was just hitting his stride and really getting comfortable in the studio during these sessions, and the results are songs that sound really fresh and honest even when they are not his greatest material.  The first nine tracks are outstanding and add a very critical element to the big picture of who 2pac was as an artist.  'Open fire' is just intense and relentless.  The title track is much more personal and comtemplative.  It resonates most strongly when 2pac feeling battered and persecuted says, \\"now the whole world's callin' me a killer, all I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real(la)\\".  And this does honestly seem to be quite true of 2pac's intentions up until the point where he made the material on this album.  I never truly understood some of the criticism that he faced.  This is pretty much the tone of the next five songs and they are all some of the best songs that he has ever written, especially 'Hell Razor'.  This is something that you just have to hear to appreciate.  2pac basically just blindly lets it go, honestly pleading and screaming his heart and soul out. \\"I'm Gettin Money\\" is another winner and \\"Like to Kick It\\" is also a pretty solid effort.  The next two songs sound like nothing more than studio exercise and should have been left off of the album.  The last track on the first disc is quite similar to \\"I'm gettin money\\" and is also quite powerful.  The second disc does not have any really bad songs but it is not as good as the first one because it only has a few songs that stand out as really great. The songs on the second disc that stand out most to me are \\"Hold on be Strong\\", \\"Do for love\\", \\"Nothin but love\\"--finding 2pac at his most compassionate and idealistic saying, \\"I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free I can't take what she offers me, this is how the world could be, this is how the world should be\\"--\\"I Wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto\\", \\"When I Get Free II\\" and, the haunting \\"Only Fear of Death\\".  This is not exactly 2pac's best album but it is one of his most enjoyable to just ride out and listen to.  It also gives you a clearer and much more well rounded picture of who 2pac was than the solid but seriously overrated \\"All eyez on me\\".  So I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see more of 2pac than what the mainstream is accustomed to.
B000002MIF|5.0|Alright read Moz Marr Smith's review cause his is awesome..so read it and that will def convince you to buy this album!...oo and thanks for the title again ;) haha <br />My favorites on this cd... <br /> <br />William It was Really Nothing <br />This Charming Man <br />How Soon is Now? <br />Hand In Glove <br />Heaven Knows Im Miserable Now <br />Girl Afraid <br />Reel Around The Fountain <br />Please Please Please Let Me get What I Want <br />Still Ill <br /> <br />9 out of the 16 are amazing and the rest are awesome also so why not buy it?haha.... so yeah, !!GET IT!!oooo and if your bored get Cursive's The Ugly Organ album too...cause Cursive is the best band along with the smiths :) <br /> <br />also my friend wants me to add: \\"Buy this album because you'll love the BBC sessions!\\" <br />haha
B000148KK2|1.0|I can't find any reason to buy this record. Well, I admit that there could be some, but for each one there's a latent disappointment in \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\". <br /> <br />You can buy it because you're a fan of Diana Krall.. But you won't find here the atmospheres of \\"The Look Of Love\\", or the fantastic swing of her \\"Live In Paris\\". Jazz is almost completely forgotten here, and that's bad because she's a good pianist (I don't like her voice) and what made her famous (added to her eyes..) is her abilities with jazz improvisation. <br /> <br />But you could maybe be a fan of Elvis Costello (who co-wrote some of the original tracks) but I don't think that's enought to spend that sum to buy this record, honestly. <br /> <br />I listened to it because I enjoyed her live disc. But this has been a great disappointement. I won't suggest you to not buy this, but.. listen to it before buying it. And compare it to the same kind of music made by artists who have experienced it in their whole career. <br /> <br />M.
B000063DFN|5.0|This CD has many classic maiden tracks: <br /> <br />Aces High: The fastest and funniest song on the Cd.It has two great solos from Adrian & Dave and eveything of this track is awesome.I like the guitar verses, the chorus and it's riffs. <br />5/5 <br />2 Minutes to midnight:The famous song on the album.The main riff is perfect and the instrummental part is exc-llnt. <br />5/5 <br />Losfer Words(Big 'Orra):I don't know what it's title means but what I know is that this last Maiden instrumental is fabulous. <br />I love the guitar playing, i like it at the 1st moment. <br />5/5 <br />Flash of the blade: The main riff got me hooked at the moment I listened to it.It is awesome! Is one of the best Adrian smith riff along with the one of Wasted Years.Then the chorus I like too much. The guitar work is brilliant, but it doesn't have solos, something very strange.  <br />5/5 <br />The Duellists: I just listen to this song one time and amazed me. <br />It is a filler, but one of the greatest fillers( this sounds stupid but is true).  <br />4.9/5 <br />Back in the village: I still don't listen to this song. It is also a filler, I guess. <br />0/5 <br />Powerslave: The main riff is very very good, it's sound, obviously, like an egytian song.The lyrics are great and the chorus is great too( Tell me why I have to be a Powerslave...). <br />Aft'r the the 2nd chorus comes the best part of the song, comes the beautiful slow solo of Dave, and then a fast one from Adrian, then a guitar duo, and then another Dave solo. Dave is shining in this song. My personal best.  <br />6/5 <br />The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: One of the highlights of the album. Take to us into a ship trip of 13 minutes 30.Even if it is too long never falls flat.  <br />5/5 <br />And this is one of the best Iron Maiden's albums ever. I don't have a favourite one, bui this is a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />
0140177396|5.0|The Great Depression in the 1930s continues to be regarded as the worst trauma of twentieth century America, and its scars are still felt to this day. If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. OF MICE AND MEN is arguably one of the best novels about the hardships of the poor during this time.  <br /> <br />Lennie and George, a pair of drifters, represent brain and braun, respectively. Caught in the whirlpool of economic collapse, the two go from job to job, taking work whenever and wherever they can find it. Along the way, and especially at the farm that is at the center of the book's action, the pair encounter violence, racism, ignorance, selfishness, and a host of other tragic qualities among the poor that are compelled to fight tooth and nail for survival. Steinbeck certainly is not blaming the poor; rather, he is saying that this is what men will resort to when denied good, decent work. And, ultimately, OF MICE AND MEN has given us a glimpse into this tragic time. A highly recommended book. <br />

0142000663|5.0|The Great Depression in the 1930s continues to be regarded as the worst trauma of twentieth century America, and its scars are still felt to this day. If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is arguably the best novel about the struggles of the poor during this time. Focusing on the hardships of the Joad family and their friends, Steinbeck gives us, in microcosm, a look at the entire population of the dispossessed of the Great Depression. The constant hunger, searches for work, violence, betrayals and setbacks that the Joads endure would have produced a grim and depressing novel in a less skilled writer's hand, but Steinbeck does not allow his characters to give in. In spite of all the calamities, the Joads maintain dignity, courage, and hope. Fortunately, for America, the poor did maintain these virtues, otherwise it would have vanished or rebelled, throwing the nation into anarchy. THE GRAPES OF WRATH, however, shows our generation just how close we came.<br /><br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS.
B00005MP58|4.0|<br />In vain have I struggled,it `ll not do.You must allow me to say how ardently I love and admire this film.I was very fortunate to read the book(thanks to the persuasion of the lady who brought me forth to this world).I simply love the language,compared to the grunts and groans we employ nowadays....hence you ought to basically be a lover of the english language first,else I would not recommend this ...film or book. <br /> The trouble with producing a film based on a  great book is that one can NEVER ever be seen adequate.Dialogues,scenes etc may be edited out,or worse altered altogether by a lesser hand.Compulsions of budget,time etc all make their presence felt.It also follows that there will be repeated attempts,which will ALL fail to satisfy everyone.(\\"It will appear well enough,for the untrained eye\\"). <br /> I have seen all three versions of this great book  :- <br />1) The old Hollywood version ------AVOID this,unless you want to see Darcy reduced to a blithering nincompoop ! Sorry,but Greer Garson cannot retrieve the situation. <br />2) The 1980 version *ing Elisabeth Garvie and David Rintoul  -more true to the dialogue written by J.Austen herself .Garvie was beautiful and better,especially in voice modulation in sarcasm(you should hear her say ):- <br />a)\\"You are mistaken,Mr. Darcy,if you suppose the \\"mode\\" of your \\"Declaration\\" ........\\" (the sarcasm in the words MODE and DECLARATION have to be heard and savoured.) <br />b)\\" Mr Darcy has no defect,he owns it himself,without disguise !\\"  <br />I think she has(had) a far greater vocal range than J.Ehle,particularly in expressing sarcasm.David Rintoul (to me) is the quintessential Darcy,ramrod stiff,tall and silent -the transformation is all the greater in the later part when \\"his manners are `softened'\\"! <br />The scene of the re meeting is so different -Darcy is preceded by his dog,which E.Benett notices(to her shock). <br />3) The A&E version : is a visual treat (despite the loss in transfer) <br />Music:- Simply love the brief pieces when (a) a wet Darcy is striding towards his house,only to bump into a startled Elisabeth  b) at his house with E on the piano and the long look that passes between them. c) The piano piece by Louisa Hurst at the Netherfield Ball (in anger) at the \\"pushiness\\" of the Bennetts. <br />Ms Ehle gives a splendid performance and is superior to Garvie in subtle facial changes ,even the break(s) in her voice sounds so natural.Truly a brilliant performance -but alas,they have removed some of the critical scenes (dialogue) -I would have loved to hear Ms Ehle say \\"\\" Mr Darcy has no defect,he owns it himself,without disguise !\\"  It's a pity one does not have enough material of this wonderful actress (reflects the \\"popular\\" tastes of our time,alas )! Plastic Baywatch babes seem to be the only worthwhile females,alas ! Colin Firth seems to be a universal favorite of the ladies,and I have \\"no strong objections to the gentleman\\" -I only wish that for a silent character that Darcy is,they had not omitted the few dialogues in the novel,and replaced them with excessively long dance sequences etc -but this may be because I am a male beast....After all the interludes between Darcy and E Benett (to me)are the main thing.....anyway,I have the book ! (was it really so essential to show Darcy going around shady areas searching for Wickham/Lydia Benett ? ) Mercifully.most of Mr. Benett `s stuff is preserved.Mrs Benett has been overdone.Lydia was enacted superbly as was Bingley,both Mr and Ms. <br /> <br />I am NOT ashamed to say that I have seen this film at least thrice(just recd my DVD) in the last month,despite being male,and a techie to boot ! I confess I am SICK of watching movies of laser guided \\"precision\\" bombs killing women and children,in every poverty stricken hellhole on earth.My manners have been \\"softened\\" not by a woman,but by the sheer perverseness of the world today ! <br /> <br />For modern \\"Darcies\\" rejected by today's Elizas(Baywatch babes),a poem from 17th century England,by Sir John Suckling's advice (addressed not to a jilted woman,but to a spurned man):-  <br /> <br />Why so pale and wan,fond lover ?  Prithee why so pale ? <br />Will,when looking well can't move her, looking ill prevail ?  <br />\\"Quit,quit for shame!...This cannot take her, <br />If,of herself,she will not love, <br />Nothing can make her,The devil take her!\\" <br /> <br />
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Scarface is simply, a must have. When I first saw this movie at my friend's house, I almost cried after I finished the movie. But I didn't because oviously, my friend who was there would've made fun of me. I don't usually cry after watching movies but whoa, this movie like inspired me or something. I used to be scared of things like getting hit by my parents but after watching this movie, I was like I shouldn't be scared of these little things because at least I didn't work for a Cuban gang, smoke yeyo all day, or have my best friend and my sister killed at the same day and even myself. So not only is this a great movie, it can almost change your life.    This movie is about this Cuban immigrant, Tony Montana, who works for gangs and kills people and smoke drugs. His life is a mess and his sister is the only person that he actually loves. So he protects her and everything until she gets married to Tony's best friend which led to murder of Tony's best friend. The same night, her sister gets killed by the gang that Tony used to work for because he didn't finish a mission. He also gets killed at the same night.     This movie doesn't really have moral or lesson but at least he doesn't hurt women or kids (which led to the failure of the last mission). But again, this movie can change you in some ways.    This movie was great. As I'm writing my review right now, I'm listening to Scarface soundtrack. It's definitl my favorite movie and it's a very good watch. Pianist and Scarface is the only movie that almost made me cry and shows more passion than any other movie that I have seen or watch. This review might not have been helpful to you but at least rent or buy this movie. It's very good.    P.S. Also watch Godfather and Simone. Very good performance by Al Pacino.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Somehow amazingly this has emerged as one of the very best comic book type movies ever. I guess because the source material was so derivative, it makes a good candidate for film adaptation since there's plenty to relate to. The Hellboy character is fantastically portrayed here, as is Abe Sapien, who is just fascinating to watch. Kronen is a most macabre villain. The effects are great (except for when HB is several times thrown through the air so slowly). The blend of every kind of horror genre is wildly entertaining. Where else can you actually see Cthulhu-like creatures floating around in the dark dimensions and emerging through portals into our world? The Director's Cut is the way to go to see this film. Even so, a few details seem to have been cut out, notably explanations of the spells and talismans that HB has in his toolkit. Regardless, this is a movie you can watch over and over - can't wait for the sequel.
B00006BTCA|3.0|This album is probably enjoyed best while driving at night during the winter. That's the feel of this music: dark, gloomy, introspective, and melodic. Songs are mellow and steady, with minimally distorted guitars and vocals that tower over the music; immensely loud and powerful when the singer chooses to be. Energy peaks in songs like Obstacle 1 and Say Hello to the Angels; energy bottoms out on NYC and Hands Away (which is by no means bad.) This cd has a lot of strong points, and a handful of weak spots. But it's a strong release; I reccomend it.
0694003611|5.0|I think I have given \\"Goodnight Moon\\" to every small child or baby I know over the years. And it has always been a beloved favorite. Clement Hurd's illustrations are bright and colorful, and Margaret Wise Brown's rhythmic prose is easy to understand and sounds soothing when read. If the child is sleepy enough it will lull him/her to sleep. But no! It is not a boring book! Wide awake baby? There are enough objects to point out and find on every page to keep any child's interest. The board book, a big plus, is extremely hardy and very difficult to love to death.<br /><br />A small bunny is stalling at bedtime and has to say goodnight to everything in sight before he'll close his eyes, including the moon and the old lady who hushes him.<br /><br />Children love \\"Goodnight Moon,\\" which also teaches them the names of so many objects. Parents love the book too. It is fun to read while snuggling. And it makes a terrific gift!<br />JANA

I love to watch the movie over and over. it gives you justice y u should see this movie. i enjoyed the movie very much. and im thinking of buying the soundtrack, since i own the movie.
0689835604|5.0|\\"Where Is Baby's Belly Button?\\" is one of the most appealing, adorable, interactive toddler's books I have seen, and this is not just my opinion. I recently bought the book for my cousin's 13 month-old little boy and he babbles, laughs, and overall expresses great pleasure when it is read to him - or when he reads it himself. He knows the text well enough now that he anticipates the responses and giggles when they're read. It has become a great favorite. Why?<br /><br />The illustrations really catch the eye. They're colorful, bright and nice and big. The text is simple - easy to understand. And the book's tough construction makes it difficult for an enthusiastic child to love it to death! In a fun, humorous way, \\"Where Is Baby's Belly Button\\", (with your help), teaches baby to learn where his eyes, ears, hands, feet....and belly button are. At 13 months, this little boy is able to lift the flaps to find the answers. The flaps are very thin, so a smaller child may need some help. And most of all, the book is happy and oozes love. I can't explain it, you'll have to take a look yourself to understand.<br /><br />Makes a terrific gift - I know!<br />JANA

0060536357|5.0|This book deserves all the superlatives it has received.  The layperson gets an idea of how an LBO is structured and the interactions of investment bankers, banks, and lawyers.  As well, the book is a riveting and entertaining read.  The key to the book are the telling details.  At one point for example, the authors note that one of the men at a key phase in the deal wears a ring with a peace symbol.  Without describing the individual any further, the authors imbue him with personality and character.  Even someone uninvolved with business deals will appreciate the intrigue and excitement.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I have to say, Howard Shore is a genius when it comes to movie soundtracks!  This one is great!  I think it really goes with the movie. I also like how every event in the movie has its own music.  Some of my favorite tracks include: \\"The Riders of Rohan\\", \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\", \\"Evenstar\\", \\"Helm's Deep\\", and \\"Forth Eorlings\\".  Anyone who is a fan of the movie should check out this soundtrack!

B0002IU988|5.0|Thats all i have to say... this album is amazing.  Alter bridge has the 3 great creed members + 1 amazing new singer and pretty much almost every song on this album will take your breath away.  I highly recommend buying this album.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is a great film in the Star Wars series!They bought some amazing new characters into the series with this film,such as Qui-Gon(Obi-Wan's teacher),Jar Jar(a clumsly Gungan who is not annoying despite what people say),and Darth Maul(a evil Sith apprentice who is really cool).Some amazing scenes(the podrace,Obi's and Oui-Gon's fight,etc.)and some things that connect this film and the orignals together are just some of the things to enjoy in this chapter in the Star Wars saga. All in all,a very good film that I truly recommend!!!
0793542049|5.0|Well, i think this is one of the best books out there that can teach you walkin'... or at least that can put you on the right track, the approach is very progressive and it has also 10 track of 2 minutes each on wich you can practice; it is very well done in the course of the book there are also some track to play along on wich you can practice the lesson you've just learned... the examples are very helpful, there are no flashy things that can distract you,there is just what is explained... with it's number two i think it's all you need to begin to learn how to walk and then you can go your own way
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is a terrific trilogy that became some of the most popular films of all time! I here to review the films only <br /> <br />A New Hope is of course the classic film that introduced us the now familar characters(Luke,Leia,Han,Vader,Obi-Wan,etc.)and bought us to a amazing a action-packed world!!!It's a fun film that is a great way to begin(or continue if you watch the prequals first)the saga <br /> <br />The Empire Strikes Back has been hailed as a better film and it truly is.A better story,new characters,and better effects fill this brillant film in the Star Wars saga. <br /> <br />Return of the Jedi is the final chapter of the saga and it is(as always)a action-packed finale with some terrific effects and some action pieces.It's the lightest film in this series(beside Epidsode I),but it's one of the most enjoyable of the series. <br /> <br />I hope my review was helpful.I hope you enjoy them. <br />
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge Rocks!  The former Creed members have turned it up a couple of notches and have got one heck of a lead singer.  Songs like \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"Metalingus\\" will give you power.  \\"Broken Wings\\" will give you chills and \\"In Loving Memory\\" will make you fight back tears.  Take my advice, by this cd.  You will not be disappointed.
B0002234LS|1.0|I dont know how in the world the producers thought they could get away with this. It was FIGHT CLUB done all over again. From about half way through the movie, it dawned on me... (smoking the same cigarette brand...) but I was hoping otherwise... but nope... that was it... they took FGHT CLUB'S dramatic ending and duplicated it. I felt so played... a really cheap and vile feeling. Jees... and FIGHT CLUB was only made a few years ago... the merry go round is getting shorter and shorter these days!  <br /> <br />Unfortunately Johnny Depp did well... too bad. <br /> <br />I'd rather watch FIGHT CLUB again.   <br />
B00005JKNC|1.0|This film's first scene actually starts with a bunch of studio execs in an appalling brainstorming session. They are attempting to rewrite the plot for a film they are making (NOT THIS ONE). In the process they create an inept and farfetched story. It struck me as the synopsis for this film. Read other reviews to get the ridiculous plot details for this film. After the REAL writer made his/her pitch for \\"The Majestic\\", this film should have been canned immediately by the studio.
B00005J6T0|5.0|Madonna has seen many phases in her phenomenal career. The \\"True Blue\\" portion of her career, arguably, could be seen as the turning point in her illustrious journey. \\"True Blue\\", is her third and most complete release.<br /><br />  Let's get the obvious out of the way here, first of all. We have Madonna, a regular hit factory, giving us the singles \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", Open Your Heart\\", \\"Live To Tell\\", and \\"La Isla Bonita\\". These are some of Madonna's best songs. She has started to grow as a person and, more importantly, as an artist. She broke away from the \\"dance bunny, teen star\\" persona that had been ready to haunt her. She says, with this release, that she can do other things than just techno dance songs. With songs like \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and \\"Live To Tell\\" she demonstrates great diversity as a singer and artist. These are both ballads with a great message, and wonderful continuity. We hear so often, dance music artists doing ballads and sounding like they are tied down; sounding restrained to the point of not being able to finish the song without adding some funk-inspired bridge or something. Madonna sings these songs with passion and, more importantly, patience. Looking back at her roll as Evita, and the class that she has developed throughout the years following this record, you got to believe that her growth began here. Even the jumping dance tracks have a fervor that others, that came previously, did not possess. The title track is a perfect example. \\"True Blue\\" has a slower tempo with a doo-wop shade to it. \\"Where's The Party\\" is so sharp and full of Madonna muscle that you can almost picture it as a hard rock track. \\"White Heat\\", \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" and \\"Love Makes The World Go 'Round\\" revert back to something you might here on the first record, but there is just something more here. It may be the company that these songs keep. These more \\"fun\\" songs are surrounded by rich and well written songs, which brings us to the primary writing force for these songs.<br /><br />  Patrick Leonard is an incredible songwriter. Working with, and releasing 2 records with, local Chicago act Trillion in the 70's, he spent the beginning of his career opening for acts such as Styx and Aerosmith. It wasn't until he found Madonna that he found a listening audience though. She saw his great writing abilities and jumped at the chance at a partnership. Don't be fooled, the great Madonna songs that we all know and love may be 9/10 Pat Leonard. He's Madonna's secret weapon.<br /><br />  Surrounded by controversy, and shrouded by both positive and negative publicity, Madonna has emerged from the flames with her head on straight and held way high. She grew up here on \\"True Blue\\". She continued to grow in her future endeavors. If you want a great Madonna record, and the beginning of it all......this is the record you want.<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]ngs. <br />     Patrick Leonard is an incredible songwriter.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I chalk the demise of this series up to poor advertising on Fox's part. I was uninterested in watching the show when it was on TV. Upon picking up and watching the first episode on DVD, I was hooked. Such deep characters and complex plots, no episode was ever the same. The one negative was the story arc made it hard to pick up the plot halfway in-you really need to watch from the beginning to get the whole story and appreciate everything. Other than that, great performances from all the actors involved really make this show worth watching. Definitely worth the money on this one.
B000001FS3|4.0|Perceived by many as one of the best records of all time, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was a passionate and voluble statement of towering proportions. With two singles, \\"With Or Without You\\" and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" achieving #1 status, and another single, \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" reaching #13, the band was poised to be crowned a fan favorite for years to come. Along with being a fan fave, the Grammy Academy fell in love also. The band received two Grammys for the record, one for Best Rock Performance, and the other for the coveted prize of Album Of The Year. The band was, deservedly, on top of the world.<br /><br />  When you start listening to the first track here, you are slowly drawn in by a jangling guitar sound that has become the group's trademark. The slow approaching intro takes a full minute and forty-five seconds to reach fruition with singer Bono's soulful soaring capping off a perfect opening track. All the signature U2 elements are present on this opener; the \\"Edge\\" guitar sound, the systematic rumble from drummer Larry Mullen, Jr.'s kit, the plodding bass lines of Adam Clayton, and of course Bono's brilliant resonance at the front of it all. This is U2, and this is classic stuff.<br /><br />  As you get further into the record, the formula remains intact. The band never strays from consistency. With tracks two and three both being #1 hits, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" vaults itself out of the gate and rarely ever lets up. After the radio heavy hitters, comes my favorite track on the record. \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" is a dark, creeping blast that is both musically and lyrically striking. Perhaps the most powerful song on the record lyrically, there is a penetrating section of spoken word that is just simply stunning. As the album slows down and allows for a more subtle U2 to shine, we get \\"Running To Stand Still\\". With a gentle voice that howls symbolically to the sky, and a weeping harmonica to finish the track, it is a great artistic piece. A bellowing Bono leads us through \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" with great passion, and sends us on to \\"In God's Country\\". Another of those signature pieces, \\"In God's Country\\" is a track that jogs musically and runs lyrically. The Edge, with that frantic jangling guitar, is the core of their sound. I've heard he achieved his technique by not being able to play complicated leads very well. However he achieved the sound really doesn't matter, the fact that he's got it does. As the band trots through \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\", and gives us an American barn dance feel, led by a simple but sharp harmonica part, you can feel the record starting to wind down. With the hopping guitar part of \\"One Tree Hill\\" and the brooding of \\"Exit\\" and \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\", the album comes to a somewhat somber close. A message that tells the listener that this band has a lot that they still want to say. The fact that they end the record with some of their more dark, progressive, and artistic pieces says a lot. They made a full record, not just a record that has attractive radio hits. They made a record that had a lot to say, and it affectively is still speaking to us almost 20 years later.<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]A bellowing Bono leads us through \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" with great passion, and sends us on to \\"In God's Country\\".

0393035158|5.0|The End of Faith is one of the most important books of our time, a must read, brilliant, provacative, passionate, and scholarly.  Harris covers an urgent  and serious topic interestingly and compellingly, maintaining a sense of humor and a hopefullness about humanity.  Harris addresses our present world crisis, raises essential questions about religion, and demands that we open a dialogue, looking at our beliefs and how they have brought us to the brink of self-annihilation before it is too late.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Since their debut record, the self-titled \\"Godsmack\\" in 1998, this band has been helping to carry the heavy metal flame into the new decade of the 2000's. Their debut was electrifying, to say the least; with the follow-up release \\"Awake\\" quite a bit weaker. With this, their third release, \\"Faceless\\" is a return to hard hitting, classic metal music.<br /><br />  Once again, Godsmack powers their way through with another strong record. Full of crunching opening riffs, and classic style manic lead guitar work, it reminds one of \\"the good ole' days\\". You know, the verse-chorus-verse structure, with a small bridge and a big whopping guitar solo thrown in.  Amen. What ever happened to the guitar solo anyway? Ever since we got Nirvana, we've been deprived of the wicked guitar soloing that was so popular in decades past. Thanks to bands like Godsmack, the drought has ended. With plenty of hot and healthy guitar licks throughout, this record follows in the footsteps of the first record. It follows the first record so closely that, that is it's one possible fault. Diversity is somewhat of a problem with this band. Like so many other Hard Rock / Metal bands, they have just one speed really, and rarely divert from it. The thing that separates Godsmack from many other acts though, ....they do that one speed damn good! Reminiscent of early Metallica, ...you remember that, right?....before Metallica learned about the power ballad, nobody did fast and furious as well as Metallica. They had only one speed, and they obliterated your ears, and the competition with it. Godsmack is on the very same track here. So, ...are they as talented as a Metallica? I would say not, but they are exciting to listen to all the same.<br /><br />  With songs such as \\"Make Me Believe\\" and \\"Re-Align\\" jumping off the disc and going straight for the throat, it is a very \\"free\\" sounding record. This band is hungry. They want to lay everything to waste that may block their rise to metal supremacy. God bless 'em....I haven't heard hunger like this from a heavy hitter for a very long time. All of these songs seem to attack you right out of the gate. With the first single, \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" rising slowly, to later bludgeon your senses, it seems almost subtle in it's approach, comparatively. \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" is a great Metal song. This record is full of great Metal songs. If you are a fan of the heavy stuff, check this one out. Not all of these songs are well crafted, but they all have great intensity.<br /><br />  Like the first record, this one finishes with a sleek tribal chant (\\"Serenity\\") that is a change of pace, but still sounds edgy. It is slower than the rest, more melodic than the rest, more sensitive than the rest; but it has an \\"unsafe\\" feeling to it also. Like you possibly just walked into this tribe's sacred ground, and they just happen to be cannibalistic! It's nice to hear vocalist Sully Erna actually sing out also. He shows throughout the record that he has great strength, but rarely shows any range or accenting style. On \\"Serenity\\" they slow it down a bit, and he shows some vocal poise.<br /><br />  This is a band that could be a contender. The writing isn't always great. The songs, at times, may seem to blend together due to the similar pace, and the overpowering vocals on most tracks. The songs, at all times though, are not \\"forced\\" or premeditated, they are natural. This band is doing what comes naturally for them, and they're doing it pretty well.<br /><br />  OVERALL RATING:  7 (1-10 scale)<br /><br />For more Dr.Music reviews, visit [...]bless 'em....I haven't heard hunger like this from a heavy hitter for a very long time.

B00028HBKM|5.0|In my opinion, this movie was very well directed and magnificantly acted. It was everything that I had expected. <br />However, I know for a fact that this movie is not entertaining, and is definitly not for everyone. I myself, am a film lover, so I enjoy this movie as purely a cinematic piece. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night though, unless you're the Osbournes, I wouldn't reccomend this. <br /> <br />Another thing is that I believe everyone should see this movie at least once. Not neccessarily own it, but experience it just once. It doesn't matter what religion you are or what you have faith in, because this movie just shows the importance of HAVING faith, and what one man went through for his faith. I myself am an agnostic and was a little hesitant about seeing this film thinking it would promote Catholic beliefs. It doesn't, from what I saw it stayed true to what supposedly REALLY happened in the last hours of Jesus Christ. It does what it set out to do, and nothing more. <br /> <br />On a final note, this movie is not anti-semetic. It does not suggest that Jews killed Jesus Christ. What it suggests is that EVERYONE killed Jesus Christ. He was paying for ALL of our sins. <br /> <br />So to summarize, see it, but you most likely won't want to own it. <br /> <br />
B000063DFN|5.0|In 1984, while pioneering what has become known as the \\"New Wave Of British Heavy Metal\\"(NWOBHM), Iron Maiden released one of the greatest records in Metal history. With a fanbase inherited from the popularity of their two previous releases, \\"Piece Of Mind\\" and \\"The Number Of The Beast\\", Iron Maiden was poised to deliver........and deliver they did.<br /><br />  \\"Powerslave\\" kicks off with the high energy rocker \\"Aces High\\", which follows the classic Maiden formula like a Yellow Brick Road. A song with break-neck guitar grinding, rapid fire drumming, and the incredible thumping bass lines of Steve Harris. The bellowing of vocalist Bruce Dickinson becomes so integrated with the band's music, it also has the feel of an \\"instrument\\"- one sign of a truly tight group of musicians. As \\"Aces High\\" comes to a close, the gritty and tough opening riff of \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\" comes out of it's cage. A simple, yet highly effective riff that immediately sends your hands an invitation to an air guitar party. As usual, you get the entire Maiden package here also; the rumbling and rolling drum fills of Nicko McBrain, the banging and clanging bass from Steve Harris, the superlative dual guitar work of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray, and of course the vocal hand of Bruce Dickinson to lead you right through to the end. The lyrical adventure in this stuff is pretty fantastic also. Whether Bruce sings \\"As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.\\", or when he shouts \\"The body bags and little rags of children torn in two, And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you.\\", either way, you know you're on a Maiden voyage. And when they leave lyrics and vocals out of a tune, you get fiery instrumentals like \\"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\\". A four minute plus display of pure musicianship which set this British powerhouse way ahead of the 80's pack of \\"hair metal\\" bands. Iron Maiden was the real deal. No talk of fun, sun, sex, or women. This was serious, uncompromising metal that never backed away from its goal; with a sound that never sacrificed its integrity for a hit single. These guys put their talent on display with challenging charts and arrangements to play, that came embedded in songs that didn't \\"fit\\" the radio single format. They did the kinds of songs that they wanted to do.<br /><br />  As the album moves at a relentless pace, all of the astonishing elements about this band are transferred from song to song. With catchy songs such as \\"Flash Of The Blade\\", The Duellists\\" or \\"Back In The Village\\" we are treated to a rigorous session of Metal supremacy, a showcase of every nuance of this great band. As we descend into the title track, ringing in at almost 7 minutes, we hear one of the best guitar solos on the record. A memorable piece, impeccably constructed around one of the best rhythm sections in metal history.<br /><br />  So, here we are. The final track of this infallible record. Wouldn't you know,....it's one of the greatest tracks ever recorded.<br /><br />  \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" is a masterpiece adapted from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem of the same name. In fact, I remember the excitement I had when I found this in my High School English textbook. I had finally found something I could relate to in school!! Someone in that same English class brought a tape of this recording in, to play for our straight-laced teacher. I can recall sitting there for 13 and a half minutes listening to this song with the entire class. A strange and beautiful moment.<br /><br />  Anyway,...yes, I said 13 and a half minutes. Iron Maiden was one of the few groups that could get away with a 13 minute song, because they kept things interesting. \\"Rime\\" is a song with peaks and valleys, a song with a majestic quality. It tells the great tale that Samuel Taylor Coleridge told, in almost the exact same verbiage. Just the task of writing and arranging a song, to fit this type of poetry, takes an enormous amount of talent. To make it last 13 plus minutes, and keep it from dragging, is astonishing. I am convinced that only Iron Maiden could pull this off. Not only do they keep this song going successfully, they leave you wanting more! I have listened to this song 4 or 5 consecutive times before, it's that good. This is the perfect closer to this resplendent record. It's a record with a dark, medieval mood that plays out like an Indiana Jones film. An adventure that is both exciting and approachable, over and over again.<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]of writing and arranging a song, to fit this type of poetry, takes an enormous amount of talent.

B00000ADG2|5.0|On her debut solo album, Ms. Hill was completely obsessed with defeating her former lover and group member, Wyclef John.  Yet, this album reveals much more than a woman scorn.  Ms. Hill combines soul, pop and hip hop to portray a complex, talented, intelligent woman.  On \\"Lost ones\\" she rages against a pompous ex lured by commercialism.  Her voice floats over the beats as she raps.  \\"Ex factor\\" is beautifully, heart wrenching tale of a sour relationship.  Ms. Hill's powerful voice seeps with a mixture of love and sorrow as she weeps \\"no matter how I think we grow you always seem to let me know it an't working\\".   \\"To Zion\\" is another beautiful ballad about the birth of Lauryns first son.  Her voice never sounds more pure or her lyrics more personal than here.  \\"Doo wop (that thing)\\" rolls over sweeping horns and piano and \\"I used to love him\\" with Mary J Blidge sees Hill and Blidge singing soulfully over a bumping beat.  Unlike other hip hop/r&b divas, Lauryn isn't afraid to delve deep into her personal life in her lyrics and her soulful voice fills with true feeling on this album.  This album, practically flawless except for the annoying spoken interludes, revealed a more sophisticated voice, lyrically and vocally than any other modern diva.   She not only outdid Wyclef, she made one of the best albums of all time.
B00008ADPF|4.0|These are the ones I like to tell everyone about. An energetic, ultra tight performance by one of the best outfits around in the rock world. \\"The Long Road\\" is a return to greatness for Nickelback, and a near perfect record for rock enthusiasts.<br /><br />  Nickelback has gotten consistently better with each record. Their debut album \\"Curb\\" was not very good; bad songwriting and average playing made for a dull record. Their second release, \\"The State\\" was quite good, actually. A giant step forward from the drabness of \\"Curb\\". And then there was \\"Silver Side Up\\". A great record all the way through, the only real downfall being its length. The brevity of the disc leads you to believe that they may have trouble coming up with good, solid songs. So, what did I expect of the new record? Well, ...I expected another short offering that was less appealing than its rock solid predecessor, \\"Silver Side Up\\". Oh boy, was I surprised to hear this record!<br /><br />  Reminiscent of the other records, \\"The Long Road\\" kicks off with its hardest, fastest, most furious thrasher. \\"Flat On The Floor\\" gets the blood pumping in a big hurry. It is \\"controlled insanity\\" at its best. As the record progresses, you can't help but notice how much these guys have grown as a unit. Even with \\"Silver Side Up\\", you knew the band was tight but it was nothing too overwhelming. With this record it is the most predominant ingredient. Every song sees the band tearing through complex rhythms and song structures with extreme precision. It's one of those albums that after you hear any one song you just say \\"OH MAN!\\"; you find it hard to believe you just heard a band play with that much \\"togetherness\\". Hearing everyone playing passionately, and as one solid unit, is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />  Early into this 14 track disc, we're treated to the first single from the record, a song called \\"Someday\\". This is your typical hook-laden classic rock track. A song with a great hook, excellent vocals and instrumentation, and a short and simple structure. Another track that has made it's way to radio, \\"Feeling Way Too Damn Good\\", has a lot of the same dynamics. Hooks that never quit, a vocal savvy like that of a seasoned veteran, and the sharpest playing to ever come out of this band. \\"Because Of You\\" follows \\"...Damn Good\\" with the tightest band performance on the record. The opening riff is a blistering funkfest of sledgehammer strength. Tight.....real tight. The band gets nasty with the track to follow that. \\"Figured You Out\\" is an X-Rated foray into catchy, sexy rhythm. I am not the biggest fan of blatant vulgarity in music. I think it can be very effective if used well. Nickelback is an act that does not make a habit of being offensive. They're usually pretty low key and Wal-Mart friendly; and that's why this works so well. It's a bit of a shock to hear this band doing something of this nature, and it sounds nice and fresh. Of course another great hook, and another tight band performance are the icing on this one.<br /><br />  We move into the ballad of the album when we reach \\"Should've Listened\\"; a touching self pity tune that, like \\"Too Bad\\" from \\"Silver Side Up\\", confronts singer Chad Kroeger's problems with his father. It becomes apparent once again that Chad has troubles with Dad. And, yes, he's done this before, but his performance is so genuine that it still works. As we work our way through more excellent songs we are treated to a real gem, a spectacular cover of Elton John's \\"Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)\\". This may be the best cover song that's ever been done. You would never know that this was not a Nickelback penned song. They rip the heart out of this song and just electrify it. Tight, man.....tight. Not a note out of place here, folks.<br /><br />  All in all, this is a really sharp outing. I might skip over a track or two, but no more than that. With this release, Nickelback has established with the rock world, that they are a major force tobe reckoned with. Pay attention folks, it don't get too much better than this.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING:  8<br /><br />(...)re a major force to be reckoned with.

B00005JKHN|5.0|Disney's masterpiece Sleeping Beauty (1959) is one of my favorite Disney films because it's not only gorgeously animated, but the music, characters and even the look itself is PERFECT for the movie!  Plus I always thought Aurora was by far the most beautiful female character by Disney animators, hehe.
B000000OAC|5.0|Queen is one of the greatest, most talented rock bands to grace the planet....and this may be the pinnacle of their existence.<br /><br />  Led by the transcendent talent of singer Freddie Mercury, Queen has always put out records that are congested with passion and style. \\"News Of The World\\" wasn't any different, giving us songs like \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\", radio regulars that we know as well as Mom. As you look down this amazing lineup of songs, it is hard to not recognize this as one of the best rock records of all time. With songs ranging from delicately poignant (\\"All Dead, All Dead\\") to pompously pornographic (\\"Get Down Make Love\\"), you explore the entire realm of what Queen has to offer.<br /><br />  The record kicks off with the ultimate anthem of all time \\"We Will Rock You\\", followed by \\"We Are The Champions\\", of course. I need to say nothing more of these two tracks. Earth's entire existence has heard these songs at least once. They are songs for all people and all times. Masterpieces.<br />  As we progress through the eclectic mix of harmonies, we hear thrashing rockers like \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" that keep us riveted to the padded wall; and, we hear the gentle \\"ivory tickling\\" from Freddie Mercury on \\"All Dead, All Dead\\". All of this balanced out by the attitude and splendor of one of Queen's sharpest songwriting efforts in \\"Spread Your Wings\\". To this day, \\"Spread Your Wings\\" still has one of the most triumphant and rousing spirits of any song that I've ever heard. You feel as if you have climbed the mountain, and you can now take the ultimate leap of faith from its summit. With all of these astonishing qualities already raining down upon us, we then realize that this band has one of the greatest guitar players in the world playing for them. As usual, Mr. Brian May is incredible.<br />  Coming upon the middle portion of the record, Queen turns out three of the most uncharacteristic songs of their career. With Roger Taylor taking on the vocal duties, we get a vicious funky rocker in \\"Fight From The Inside\\". A song driven by a sly, pulsing heaviness with great style and peculiarity. With \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" we are treated to an almost chant-like explanation of the ultimate kinky sexual relationship! With lyrics like \\"I suck your mind, you blow my head\\", this is a raunchy rocker that's so well written that it still seems to scream with poise. Both of these tracks are followed by a bluesy piece entitled \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk\\", written and sung by guitarist Brian May. As you may have guessed, the song has a brilliant lead guitar part, and is an interesting diversion from the overall sense of the rest of the record.<br />  Starting to wind down, we get \\"Who Needs You\\" to send us away. A song that transports us to, maybe Spain, or possibly the Caribbean.....you can only imagine the brilliance here. A classy ditty with a great percussion line, and an extraordinary guitar tone. A Spanish guitar, or even a Classical style, guitar part that's played with genius.<br />  Then we come to the final passion delivery. \\"It's Late\\" is an incredible display of explosive vocal strength, and it has a passion and vigor to it that is one of Queen's most treasured trademark qualities. Listening to, and singing along with, this track should make your body shake and your fists clench; if these symptoms do not occur, check your pulse.<br /><br />  As they close the album appropriately with a piano / vocal extravaganza, you get the feeling like you have received royal treatment. This is a classy, delicate, raunchy, and lovely recording. All of the greatest qualities that this great band had to offer were on display with this record, a true rock masterpiece.<br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]al duties, we get a vicious funky rocker in \\"Fight From The Inside\\".

0064471837|5.0|The above refers the series. Never has such a creative and ingenious novel fallen into my hands. Sabriel is 18 and is trained in the art of necromancy. She is however, an Abhorsen rather than a necromancer....meaning she lays the dead to rest rather than stir them back to life.<br /><br />Sabriel's perilous journey to the Old Kingdom is wrought with danger and adventure. The only defense of use to her is her seven bells, each with a different dominion over the dead. Her favorite, Ranna, pushes the living into sleep and the dead into a weakened state for return to the underworld.<br /><br />With amazing character development and wonderful plot, this is simply a must-read for ANYONE with an imagination.

B000001F9E|5.0|Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson. Has there ever been a better twin lead guitar record ever recorded? After listening to a spine-tingling jamfest like \\"Emerald\\", it would be tough to find anything better than Thin Lizzy's \\"Jailbreak\\".<br /><br />  Gorham and Robertson are astounding on this tremendous effort from 1976. This record has it all; legendary frontman Phil Lynott providing solid bass work along with his sly \\"ghetto\\" vocal, the incessant rhythmic rolling of drummer Brian Downey, a range of song styles that is rare for any artist from any decade, and of course.....there's Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson with guitar acrobatics throughout. A truly amazing record through and through.<br /><br />Most people know the two big hits from the record, \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\", as they are in constant rotation on your local Classic Rock stations; but it's the rest of the record that is really electrifying. With songs such as \\"Romeo And The Lonely Girl\\", \\"Warriors\\", and \\"Cowboy Song\\" rounding out the album, my jaw drops every time I listen. From the initial explosion of the very first note of the title track to kick things off, to the most amazing dual lead guitar solos ever recorded on \\"Emerald\\", this is a record that has so much to offer in every facet of the \\"classic rock formula\\". With the jumpy, jangling guitar work that shuffles through \\"Angel From The Coast\\" and \\"Romeo And The Lonely Girl\\", and the free and easy pop cadence of \\"Running Back\\", this is not only a record with a lot of muscle, but a record with loads of eloquence also. Check out the ultra-cool and mellow mood of \\"Fight Or Fall\\", which reminds this writer of 70's African-American cultural nuances such as the \\"afro\\" and Cooley High\\". This is an artful record with phenomenal musicianship. It's difficult to talk about anyone else with those two overwhelming guitarists doing the job, but let's not forget an amazing drum performance by Brian Downey. Numerous times I have listened to some records and just wind up wishing for a crash cymbal to sound at that perfect place, or a drum fill that never comes. Downey never disappoints here. With constant drum fills rolling through almost every track, and great explosiveness with precise timing, he matches the guitar intensity extremely well. Check out the six measure drum solo in \\"Warriors\\", ...great stuff.<br /><br />  I keep returning to it though.  Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson.  Wow.<br /><br />  This may be the only record that the guitars have more \\"lyrics\\" than the singer. I believe, that the sign of great guitar soloing is when the listener can almost \\"sing\\" what's been played. When I think about this record, and find it buzzing in my head at the dinner table, it is the finely crafted guitar solos that I find to be the hooks here! This is an amazing thing!! I cannot think of more than 5 records that have solos that stick anywhere near this heavy. The guitar parts of this record are songs within themselves. They take on personality and character, and they ultimately become entities.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Amazing.<br /><br />  If you are a fan of great guitar playing, and you have not heard this entire record....PLEASE, find it - hear it - end up \\"singing\\" the greatest solos ever recorded.<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit DrMusic.new-sounds.comme records and just wind up wishing for a crash cymbal to sound at that perfect place, or a drum fill that never comes.

B00005V0X5|5.0|the first record the way it should have always being.    This is Megadeth's debut album, this is the first answer that Dave Mustaine had against Metallica, and what an answer it is.     Throughout this record you hear the most blisteting guitar riffs, finger-knotting solos, speed-pounding drumbeats, low driving bass lines, angry vocals, and in general, the most Metal attitude until the day it was released by Combat Records.    From opening to closing, this is pure thrash/speed metal, and all at it's best. Yet, the very interesting recipe that this recod has that no other Megadeth record has, is the weird time signature (at least at the time they were strange for the straigh 4/4 usual metal), which is a courtesy of the rhythm section by Gar Samuelson on drums and Chris Poland on the second guitars (since he does leads too with Mustaine).    In the remix, the bass is a winner, you can hear David's lines clearer than ever and it's no longer mixed with the guitars so much that it's unlistenable. Also the guitars and vocals have being rescued from the old reverb-infested mix.    In addition to all those benefits, there is the original artwork and songs that were taken out from the original record, aside from (not really necesary) bonus tracks.    With all these additions, this is now a record that deserves to be part of every Megadeth collection and every true metal-head's collection as well.    Highlights: The Mechanix  Lowlights: the goddamn bleeping on These Boots
B0000024K1|5.0|Whoever doesn't like this album, i don't know what to tell u!! <br />this album is so dope!! if u like P.E. pick this album up!!! <br /> <br />Rebel Without A Pause is the best best one!!
B0002EXH40|5.0|When I went to check out the remasters of all Megadeth albums, there was little to be done with the digital records (other than Risk this is). Let me explain this one. <br /> <br />This record was better produced than any Megadeth record that preceeds it. Still Dave decided to re-do-it. Yeah it sounds slightly more polished, but you gotta pay a lot of attention to the instruments in order to get it. <br /> <br />Youthanasia is still a thrashy album in parts such as the tittle track, the opener \\"Reckoning Day\\" and the closer \\"Victory\\" ( and even better the newly added track New World Order which kicks a$$ and also kinda previews the sound that bands like \\"In Flames\\" would use later). This record posseses great \\"Metal Grooves\\" like in Train Of Consequences, The Killing Road, and Black Courtains (which sounds like a Megadeth version of \\"sad but true\\" by alternica, oh sorry, Metallica, but better). Also features the majestic pseudo-metal-ballad and masterpiece \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" which alone is worth the whole album. <br /> <br />The original version was produced digitally but with reverb added, with this new \\"recording\\" of it, we get a much clear sound (hardly different from the orignal though), while still sharing the poisonous attacks that the guitars, and vocals of the original version featured. <br /> <br />Is it worth buying? if you own the original print, specially the non-american one... no it's not worth it. If you didn't, stop reading this and buy it now. <br /> <br />Highlights: A Tout Le Monde, Reckoning Day <br />Lowlights: Family Tree and Blood Of Heroes are not as memorable, yet still kick ass.
0679411585|5.0|I read this book back in 1994, and I've just finished re-reading it.  It is one of the best war stories ever written.  There are two battles chronicled here, X-Ray and Albany.  The battle at landing zone X-Ray, where Col. Hal Moore's 1st battalion 7th Cavalry fought three battalions of NVA regulars, was made into the movie starring Mel Gibson.  In this battle, the cavalry troopers landed by helicopter and formed themselves into a defensible perimeter before the NVA could attack.  X-Ray could probably be termed a victory for the U.S. forces, since they lost about 70 killed in action, as opposed to about 600 confirmed and 1200 estimated NVA.<br /><br />The second battle, Albany, was not in the film, probably because it was a terrible defeat for the U.S. forces.  The 2nd battalion, 7th Cavalry, under the command of Col. Robert McDade, was ordered to walk out of X-Ray to another landing zone about 10 miles away.  Leading elements captured two enemy soldiers, and McDade called all the company commanders forward for a pow wow.  While the men were leaderless and spread out along the line of march, an NVA battalion fell on them and cut them to pieces.  The cavalry was able to form a perimeter near the front of the column and, thanks to the heroism of Captain George Forrest, who sprinted through a hail of bullets the 550 yards back to his company at the rear of the column, another perimeter at the rear of the column.  In between these two perimeters, along the line of march, was a grisly killing ground in which survivers of the initial onslaught, most of whom were wounded, fought in small groups, trying to stay alive.  Bands of NVA walked around, shooting and killing the wounded.  Over 150 U.S. soldiers were killed during this battle, and many more seriously wounded.  This could not be called a U.S. victory.<br /><br />Perhaps the most moving and important part of this book is near the end, where family members of some the U.S. officers killed in the battle tell the stories of their lives.ories of their lives.
B000002MIF|5.0|The Smiths released their second album, Hatful Of Hollow, in November of 1984. The album is basically a compilation, consisting of two BBC sessions (John Peel, 9/21/83 and 4/7/83),  <br />as well as singles released from the previous album and unreleased tracks. The album is worth it simply because of guitarist Johnny Marr's stunning guitar work alone. <br /> <br />1. William, It Was Really Nothing: The album kicks off with one of The Smiths' new singles. A short and upbeat song, it contains the funny \\"fat girl\\" verse. <br /> <br />2. What Difference Does It Make (BBC): This song doesn't differ too much of the album version, but it is still a great song.  <br /> <br />3. These Things Take Time (BBC): A song that was left off of the debut album in favour of Still Ill, it is a fast song with tight lyrics. <br /> <br />4. This Charming Man (BBC): The BBC version of this single is fantastic. Everything runs well in this song, it is one of the best of this album. <br /> <br />5. How Soon Is Now?: Arguably The Smiths most famous song, this is what gave the band the push they needed during their early years, proving that the band were no one-hit wonders. A long single with a unique sound that only The Smiths can provide. <br /> <br />6. Handsome Devil (BBC): An underrated song which was on the Troy Tate version of the debut album. Morrissey again faces controversy with the lyrics of the song. Is it controversial? You decide. <br /> <br />7. Hand In Glove: The Hatful Of Hollow version of this song was the original single used. In the beginning it fades in, surely a limp start to such a great, hard-rocking track. It was remixed by producer John Porter for the The Smiths debut album. <br /> <br />8. Still Ill (BBC): This version includes a harmonica both at the beginning and the end of the song. It gives the song a strange feel, wouldn't you agree? <br /> <br />9. Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now: What a great song the band chose for their single. The music is great and the lyrics are excellent. This is a song that will never tire you out from listening. <br /> <br />10. This Night Has Opened My Eyes (BBC): This BBC version is the only version of this song to be released. Such an underrated song. <br /> <br />11. You've Got Everything Now (BBC): A very good song, it doesn't differ greatly from the album version. <br /> <br />12. Accept Yourself (BBC): Some silly lyrics with a surprisingly average performance from Marr proves that this is just a normal B-Side. <br /> <br />13. Girl Afraid: You will listen to this song over and over again, since the guitar and bass lines are perfect together. <br /> <br />14. Back To The Old House (BBC): You will find this song better than the original album version due to Marr's guitar and Morrissey's lyrics. <br /> <br />15. Reel Around The Fountain (BBC): A great song, it is equal to the album version. <br /> <br />16. Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want: This song is extremely short, but it will touch you unlike any other way. What a tremendous song. <br /> <br />Overall, a nice album to fit in between the solid debut and the third album, this is really one that you can't leave behind. The BBC versions are truly amazing, as well as the other songs on this album. You will love \\"How Soon Is Now?\\". I definitely recommend this album to music fans. You will love it.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my son when I was in the last trimester of pregnancy. He loved the book, asked lots of questions and the baby is now 7 months old and I still read the book to my son. A nice, quick read for those nights you are tired but you child wants a story.  It also easy for little ones to understand the concept.
B000002TQV|5.0|In their sophomore effort, The Bends is such a remarkable album that people are surprised that Radiohead is the band that produces Pablo Honey which the music pales in comparison. The Bends has a mix of ballads and rock songs which were so skillfully crafted with instruments that suited to each song, therefore they sound so mystically soothing and melodic. Bends's first few tracks like \\"Planet Telex\\" and \\"High and Dry\\" are enough to entice you to carry on listening. Throughout, every song is a blow out and you can never go wrong in this album.
B0000009OP|4.0|As a bass player, I love the way the band explores the lower end of the spectrum, that, and Mark Sandman's playing and writing is incredible.

B0001ENYKS|4.0|These are some smart scots.  Skinny-tie-rock intelligence mixed with disco funkiness.  Oodles of fun.
B000000OSE|4.0|The two Use Your Illusion albums, relaesed simultaniously by Guns N Roses in September of 1991 mark a significant change of direction from the raw, visceral attack of Appetite for Destruction and the rootsy acoustic offerings of Lies.  Even on the more traditional cuts from these two discs, it is obvious that GNR were looking to expand their sound to epic proportions.  Whereas Appetite was essentially a chronicle of life on the streets of the LA \\"jungle,\\" the Illusion albums are more preoccupied with interpersonal relationships and the meaning of life, so to speak.  Consequently, there is a far more mature perspective offered here--a quality that lends an epicness to the recordings.   <br />That having been said, it is evident that the band was pushing in two diametrically opposite directions.  Axl's pretensions to play music influenced by Elton John, Queen and [latter day] Led Zeppelin is more than evident on November Rain, Estranged, Breakdown and Civil War, while Izzy, Slash & Co. are more concerned with expanding on the bands pre-existing sound, which borrows heavily from Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones and [early] Zeppelin--see Dust N Bones, Pretty Tied Up, Locomotive and You Ain't the First.   <br />A common criticism of these albums is that the band should have divided the above ambitions between the two discs rather than selecting the running order randomly.  This is partly true; the running order could have been better.  The problem lies not so much in the division of ambitions but in the pacing.  The Beatles \\"White Album\\" is rambling and often incoherent becuase it is paced poorly and has too much filler.  Led Zepppelin's Physical Graffiti--arguably the best double album of all time--seperates the songs from the filler.  That's what GNR should have done.  If disc I had been comprised of November Rain, Estranged, Locomotive, Civil War, Coma, Don't Cry, You Could Be Mine and Pretty Tied Up, and the second disc had summer up the remainder of the songs and filler, GNR would have accomplished Axl's dream of surpassing Appetite. Rather, The Use Your Illusions are two great albums that never reached their potential of being truly phenominal.
B00005JMAH|1.0|two words:  thats it?  This was the first of the Harry Potter series where I read the book and watched the movie.  (I watched the 1st 2 movies before actually giving the books a try)  And I just have to say that the movie was disappointing by far.  Where to even begin??    1) the very first scene:  harry was writing an essay about \\"witch burning in the fourteenth Century was conmpletely pointless--discuss\\" in the middle of the night, not practicing lumos over and over again.  Hes not even supposed to do magic out of Hogwarts!    2) Hagrids hut has suddenly slid down a (pre-PoA) non-existent hill.    3) The scenery has definitely changed.  I dont remember the land that Hogwarts was built on being so bumpy.  As I recall, in Chamber of Secrets, the whomping willow was right next to the school (on flat ground) when it drove through the school, past hagrids hut, and into the dark forest.  All of this was on flat ground!    4) The divination room (as I remember from the book) had a trap door as the door.  The door in the movie was anything but a trap door, seeing as its just A DOOR!    5) The stupid/pointless animal candy scene:  what exactly was the point of that??  Apparently thats more important than Harry finding out that his father, Black, lupin, and Pettigrew made the marauder's map or that Gryffindor finally won the quidditch cup (first time in at least 7 years).  6) Since when do dementors fly??  I remember Harry looking down and after seeing first the grim (who actually turned out to be Sirius) then a bunch of dementors looking up at him, he falls 50 feet.  a) he doesn't RUN INTO THE DEMENTORS IN THE CLOUDS b) he doesnt fall 100s OF FEET c) dementors GLIDE! d) and one more thing:  since when does harry wear GOGGLES??  7) the fact that they never explained what Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs meant. For all the people who hadnt read the books knew, Harrys patronus was a bush!  8) The lack of several characters including Wood, Cedric, and Cho. (mainly Quidditch)  9) Harry was hitting Malfoy with mud (not snow), then he went back through the tunnel in honeydukes to head off malfoy incase he got back and told someone that he saw harry and thats when Snape catches him right after he gets back in the school.  Snape doesnt catch him wandering the halls at night looking for Pettigrew.  10) and the thing that bothers me the most is the ending.  FIREBOLT:  should be in the middle movie!  And it came w/ a feather??  That was how harry was to know that it came from Sirius???  Wow...and then they also left out Pigwidgeon who delivered the note from Sirius saying that the firebolt was from him and would be Rons new pet.    The movie, all in all was very (I wont say bad because to anyone who hasnt read the books might think that its good) disappointing and rushed.  It didnt really flow.  I was finding myself longing to get the 3rd book and using it to guide me in exactly what part the movie was at because it was just...not as much confusing as not clear enough.  The story (or more back story) was badly explained if at all and the movie pretty much disregarded the rest of the book and just focused in on the Sirius Black conflict.  It was very non dimensional unlike JK Rowlings version of PoA.  It also felt unusually short.    Although the acting WAS wonderful. Oldman (wish he couldve had more lines/scenes), Thewlis, Rickman, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson were great!  And Emma Thompson made a lovely Professor Trelawny.  Michael Gambon was good, however no one can ever replace Richard Harris as the true Dumbledore.    Aside from the actors, none of which I can really complain about, I just have to come out and say it.  The movie SUCKS.  Read the book, the movie does it no justice at all.
B00005JMUA|5.0|...Tarantino is a virtuoso film-maker.  He ranks among the very best.  There is not a wasted frame in this 136 minute, hysterically violent chop-socky masterpiece. I laughed myself sick through the dirtiest brawl I've ever witnessed on film (although, granted, I cry through Geiko commercials):  the showdown between The Bride and Elle (Daryl Hannah).  All of the elements (music, cinematography and especially the crack editing) coalesce supernaturally and an All-American Cheeseburger Deluxe of a movie is unleashed.  Never boring.
B00005JN2X|5.0|COLLATERAL is simply excellent entertainment.  The direction by Michael Mann is tense, highly nuanced, and achieves superb performances from of his excellent cast.  The plot line is fairly straight forward: hired assassin (Tom Cruise in a role that comes close to his fine acting turn in A FEW GOOD MEN, which is praise indeed) engages a good guy cabbie (Jamie Foxx in an outstanding performance! - watch the nominations....) to privately transport him around Los Angeles for six night hours while he murders witnesses to a trial.  More than that you need not know: the movie is basically a duet for these two actors with excellent support form incidental players the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, and the always fascinatingly gifted Javier Bardem, etc.  The camera work takes us places Los Angeles hides under smog during the day, skylines at night so magnificent you'd think they were New York.  But then there is also the grit, the smarmy side of all sectors of LA, and Mann and his cinematographer capture it all with relish.  The accompanying musical score is apropos and builds tension.  But in the end it is the tour de force of the interaction between Foxx and Cruise that makes this movie more than just another summer action flick.  It deserves repeated watching!
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I thought the movie was a great portayal of what the family goes through during a war and their loved ones are off fighting not knowing what is happening to them. This gives a inclination of what the family went through and the horrors they had to endure. <br /> <br />This movie could have gone without the x-rated scenes. The inclination of what was about to happen would have had a lot more meaning to the story than the actual showing of the explicts during the love scene as well as the prostitute scene. <br /> <br />Renee was amazing and very much deserved her awards.

B000002H70|5.0|If it is possible to \\"burn\\" a CD like that of playing a record too many times, \\"Disintegration\\" fits the bill.  This recording of some of the most influencial music of the late 80's and 90's, spent many nights in my CD player.  As these musicians were influenced by Joy Division and Siouxsie & the Banshees, so too they have influenced many musicians. <br /> <br />I think I hear surface noise... <br />

And he must deal with his grieving son and daughter who are trying to fit into their new home and are trying to deal with the unique occurrences in their lives. And to top it all off, the son meets the girl of his dreams who uses this factor to get him to talk his father into operating on her boyfriend who happens to be the town's all-star and comatose athlete. <br /> <br />This show is backed up with a powerful cast along with amazing actor Treat Williams as the grieving Dr. Andy Brown. The story line and each episode is cleverly written and narrorated which adds even more to the heart warming drama. It is very believable and life like in the fact it deals with everyday events and not so everyday events. The season premiere and finale were everything they should be; perfect and left the audience wanting more. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this clever series which can only get better.   <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|It is a widely held view that the original Star Wars trilogy is one of the greatest series of movies in history. So this DVD package is a must buy. Right? Wrong. Here's why.    Do you realise these versions of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are not the original versions, nor are they the 'special editions' from 1997? They are actually the special editions 'touched up' again! These versions are so far removed from the originals that we are not buying what we saw and fell in love with in 1977, 1980, and 1983. 'A New Hope' (aka Star Wars!) has lost its charm because it is now an unconvincing hybrid of blue-screen/cheap props and high-tech computer animation. This version of Star Wars is caught between two vastly different film-making techniques and as a result, has lost its continuity and just looks silly. For example, we see the 1970's computer screen describing (in very outdated imagery) the plan to destroy the Death Star just prior to the digitally enhanced X-Wings flying past Yavin. Where is Lucas' consistency? This occurs very obviously, throughout the whole movie. Despite these flaws in Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi don't suffer near as much in comparison. Lucas had a larger budget when he produced these films, and it shows.     Hold back on this package if you want the originals!    Do you realise that Episode 3 is due out in cinemas in May 2005? There will be a boxed set of all 6 Star Wars films to follow at some stage. Do you think anyone would buy this future 6-movie package if it wasn't going to be a superior product? No. Lucasfilm will have to convince the public to spend money on these movies again. The 6 movie DVD will be THE package to buy.    Hold back on this package as there will be a superior package of the 6 films to come.    Did you know that George Lucas has stored away so much more footage from the originals than has been shown? There are scenes in \\"Star Wars\\" featuring Biggs and Luke on Tatooine, scenes from \\"Empire\\" featuring Wampas attacking stormtroopers and rebels, and scenes of Luke training with Yoda, scenes from \\"Jedi\\" featuring the Rancor, sandstorms, dialogue between Obi-Wan and Luke. The list goes on. George Lucas has to make use of these scenes. They are not in this package. So they must be included in a future DVD package.    Hold back on this package if you want to see those 'missing' scenes.    We deserve a package like the Alien Quadrilogy where we would get both the original version AND the special addition. Lucas should also take note of Peter Jackson and the quality of the Lord of the Rings DVD packages. We shouldn't have to keep spending money on inferior products because we are not told the truth about what will or will not be released in the future.     Having said that, I bought these because I love the saga. The DVD extras are excellent and the picture quality and soundtrack are outstanding, but I've got the feeling Lucas is holding alot back. If you can wait for the 6 movie package then do so.

B000002UTI|5.0|This is a good collection of songs spanning John's career, with the Beatles, and then on his own. The best songs are the ones that deal with John's personal search for love, peace and identity.<br /><br />  Highlights include 'The Ballad of John and Yoko,' 'Help,'<br /><br /> 'God,' and 'Don't Let me Down,' including earlier Beatles material. Truly a versatile songwriter, singer and musician. This is genius.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|Matrix Revolutions was interesting as sort of a post-modernistic blend of Christianity and Jungian psychology, but in the end it was a let down as an action adventure movie, and it's message was rather garbled. <br /> <br />The main positive for me was that they didn't resort of one of those ubiquitous finales where some sort of clock is ticking down to disaster, with the world saved with 2 seconds to spare.   <br /> <br />But the ending was not very satisfying.  Nothing was resolved in any way that seemed permanent. The main characters were abandoned and minor characters pushed to the front of the stage.  What philosophical points it made were confused by the need to show something exploding, speeding, or performing Kung Fu every few minutes.

0385336810|5.0|Emma has no idea why her actions backfire so frequently.  Think of Clueless, cross that with Bridget Jones and you have a hint of what a fun movie this would make.  I'm picturing Hugh Grant playing Jack, the tycoon.  It's fun, as the reader can't wait to see what comes out of Emma's mouth next.  The girl has a knack for bumbling through life, yet you can't help cheering for her to overcome it all.  Update: I just found on the internet that this will become a movie, with Erin Cressida Wilson to adapt the book into a screenplay for Kate Hudson to star in.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|MOST PROBABLY THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND ENTERTAINING DVD COLLECTION EVER!!!! ANY ALIEN FAN WILL DIE WHEN THE READ ITS CONTENTS, OFFERING US DIRECTORS CUTS OF EACH FILM. THOUGH ALIEN3 ISNT TECHNICALLY A DIRECTORS CUT ITS RUNNING TIME HAS THE MOST FOOTAGE INCREASED. LITERRALY EVERY ASPECT OF FILMING IS INCLUDED IN THE NUMEROUS BEHIND THE SCENES ARCHIVES AND THE FILMS ARE ALL ACCOMPANIED WITH EXTENSIVE COMMENTARYS, WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION OF THE FOOLISH AND ULTIMATELY UNGRATEFUL DAVID FINCHER. HE COULD NOT BE PRAISED MORE BY THE OTHER DIRECTORS AND EVEN THE PRODUCERS AND HIS SUPPOSED FALIURE ALIEN3 HAS BEEN RESTORED WITH THE MATERIAL THEY APPARENTLY SOOO NEEDED TO MAKE THE FILM WORK. FACT -ALIEN 3 IS A MASTERPIECE DIREC CUT OR NOT AND A FINE CONCLUSION TO THE SERIOUS SERIES UNLIKE THE CAMPY AND HILLARIOUS ALIEN RESURRECTION WICH WAS SO SILLY I SOMETIMES EVEN FORGOT THEY MADE IT AND INCLUDED IT IN THIS BOXSET. TRULY ALIEN DIES WITH DIGNITY AS A TRILOGY ALONG WITH HANNIBAL LECTERS TRILOGY, SCREAM,AND STAR WARS.
B000001E3V|5.0|one of the best live cds i own. actaully my favriote. clapton is flawless at this show. hendrix or page could only wish they had the skill of the slowhand.this is great stuff esp since there is no allman, not much for the slide. have you ever loved a women has sucha  great lead in the rest of the solos on the record barely even matter . tell the truth, let it rain and little wing also are show stoppers.  the tone he reaches is unreal. clapton sings very little alot of jamming here.. but then again blues is based on the guitar speaking for you.. and it speaks. if your a clapton fan you must own this record. if not and you just love great music pick it up.. after this fillmore show the only one that comes close is ten years after with alvin lee jamming out. but its a 5 on the slowhands playing those nights.. great great stuff
6305903182|5.0|FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST SAY THAT YOU WILL NEVER BEAT THE ORIGINAL SCREAM. SECONDLY, THIS IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE, AND ALOT BETTER ACTED AND SHARPER THAN IT'S PREDECESSER SCREAM2. LETS HOPE WES CRAVEN AND NEVE CAMPBELL HAVE THE SENSE TO LEAVE THIS GOING OUT ON A VERY HIGH NOTE, AS JAIMIE LEE CURTIS SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH HALLOWEEN H20, I MEAN WOULD ANYBODY SPIT ON A COPY OF HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION?
B000089CKH|4.0|this album is one of nadas best... sound is sacraficed for pure lyrical genius. such a penchant for a song nada surf makes you feel like the songs are being sang directly to you.. killians red is a great song my personal favriote. the album shows a different show far more mellow the prox effect which is a tad better id say.. but this trio pulls it off again great band even better live. slick lyrics spread with great backing music.
1558908498|3.0|big fan of the scream trilogy. but scream2 is without a doubt the weakest link. I actually liked scream2 when I came out of the theatre, but after seeing it just one more time I started to notice the painfully obvious flaws, and it's not easy for me to say this, but the painfully bad overacting. Unlike the first and third film which managed, or should I say bothered, to avoid these mistakes, scream2 is so riddled with mind numbing stupidity that somehow viewers are not seeing. Don't get me to wrong this is still way above average for a thriller, but if your looking for depth your not going to find it. This was an insult to everything the first scream and scream3 stood for.I'm also a huge fan of some of the cast members in 2, but they have been given much better roles in other films and in this movie are just given the recycled roles of the first film. In scream3 at least we have new characters and much better acting. Actors who have had so many movies you can't count them all. Not to mention new inventions the trilogy, since scream2 decided to miss that department as well i.e scream3 has the delicous voice changing device and the creepy element of the fact that our leadfing heroin could be losing her sanity due to apperisions of her dead mother. We are blessed however with Liev Schrieber in scream2, though he seems to do more and better acting in only the first 6 minutes of the third film. You can just tell which of the three the actual actors took seriously by the effort they put. And in effort, scream2 lacks the defenition of the word
B0001Z363W|5.0|Even better than Pride and Glory or Book of Shadows. This CD is the best buy I've made in a long time!
B00012FXAE|4.0|Out of all the 'Alien' films to be released, this second sequel is by far the best in terms of story line, direction, and non-stop action.  Directed by the talents of James Cameron (Terminator I and II; The Abyss; Titanic), the audience is kept on the edge of their seats as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) once again duels with the predatory aliens.    Awakened from suspended animation while returning from her first ordeal in 'Alien', Ripley is cajoled by an unscrupulous company agent (Paul Reiser) to go to a new colony with a platoon of Space Marines to investigate their loss of contact.  Arriving on the planet, our characters find the colony transformed into an alien hive with the colonists as breeding hosts.  How can they be stopped?  Ripley receives the help of a hardened marine (Michael Biehn: Reese from Terminator) to finish of the pests.  Will they succeed?    This is by far the best of the franchise.  Cameron was still fresh with concepts from 'Terminator' and applied them very well in this sci-fi genre.  New sorts of aliens along with a more proper arsenal of futuristic weapons makes this a non-stop sci-fi horror/action film for everyone to enjoy.
0800177975|5.0|Action meets \\"tongue in cheek\\"-comedy meets Toontown. A Great movie that should have gotten more credit for it's wit, charm and guts to do something a little bit different. Some of the same idiot critic's that blasted it on first release, later praised the movie and wondered why it didn't do better.
B0000399WC|4.0|Franklin J. Schaffner directed this 1973 film with a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo (Spartacus) and Lorenzo Semple Jr.  The screenplay is based on the autobiography of Henri Charriere (aka \\"Papillon\\"), a small-time pimp in Paris who was convicted of murder and sentenced for the rest of his life to the prison colony in French Guyanna: home of the infamous Devil's Island. A very good film that brings to life Charriere's alleged experiences in the infamous Carribean prison island.  The acting of McQueen and Hoffman along with Shaffner's superb direction makes this film a great drama.    The story follows the conviction and sentencing of Henri Charriere for a crime he claims he never committed.  He was sentenced to a life of hard labor to the Carribean prison colony in French Guyana.  Trying to survive the deplorable conditions of French Guyanna and later Devil's Island, Charriere makes friends with Dustin Hoffman's character.  Always having the intent of escaping, Charrierre tries to enroll the help of his friend to find a way to freedom.  Despite many attempts, Charrierre is unable to escape and is subjected to even more gruelling conditions than before.  He finally escapes after many years in solitary confinement.  Although not shown in the film, Charrierre didn't live long after returning. He did bring to the French government's attention the inhuman conditions at the prison colony which caused the permanent closure of Devil's Island as a penal institution.  Charriere hoped to earn a living from the sales of his rather exaggerated autobiography but died a natural death before he ever reaped any profits.    The film is a good character study and the acting of McQueen and Hoffman is ideal for this.  The audience is also kept hostage in the brutal environment of our heroes.  The film has a solid script with very good direction by Schaffner.  A great drama to watch many times.
B000002BBY|4.0|Let me just get one thing clear before I continue with the review: Oasis is NOT for everyone. Gallaghers voice is seen as moving and powerful by some, annoying by some others. However this is my review, and I say that this is an album that's certainly worth picking up. His vocals don't bother me in the slightest.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Wonderwall or Don't Look Back In Anger, where the heck have you been hiding? This is one of the best songs this album has to offer; they're still powerful and moving to this day (particularly Wonderwall).<br /><br />Other tracks like Morning Glory, She's Electric and the awesome opener Hello will really get your blood pumping... those boys really know how to play guitar! Gallaghers vocals smack you in the face from the very beginning, and continues to do so until the end of the album.<br /><br />The best songs on the album, however, are Some Might Say (with particularly interesting lyrics), and the album closer, Champagne Supernova, the most calming song on the album. It's long, but a great piece of music... it makes you feel like you're floating away!<br /><br />So why didn't I gave it a 5 star rating? Well, there are a few songs that just don't appeal to me. Roll With It, Cast No Shadow and Hey Now! don't stand out and make as much of a mark as the other tracks do.<br /><br />Only just missing out on a 5 star rating, I recommend this album to anyone... just be sure to buy the Wonderwall single first, and see if you can stand the vocals first :P
B000022TSH|5.0|More proof that one of the golden ages of American cinema was in the '70's.<br /><br />I personally don't subscribe to this point of view with the same conviction as other cinephiles, but it's hard to argue when films as good as Chinatown were made with regularity.<br /><br />Incredible script, great camera work, great direction. All the leads are great, all the supporting actors are great, and all of the bit parts are done well - what more is there to say? The film is virtually flawless in every way.<br /><br />If you love movies, this is a must-have.
4789004546|5.0|This book simply has no peer. It is by far the clearest, most thorough, most concise and well-thought-out Japanese language resource out there. If you really want to understand Japanese and how it works, this is the tool for you.    You can use this book as a reference when you come across a new grammatical pattern, or systematically go through it to learn new ones. The book explains Japanese grammar points in clear English and gives many example sentences to cover the range of their uses.    People often ask me, \\"what's the best textbook for learning Japanese?\\" In my opinion, there are no good textbooks. What you need are good RESOURCES on certain areas, and this is the best for grammar. Unlike all the silly \\"Mr. Smith goes to Tokyo\\" textbooks, this book does not make you go through a pointless story from which you mine a few nuggets of information. A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar presents you with what you want to know, with no time wasted on anything else. This and a good Kanji-learning resource are what you need to begin your road to true proficiency in Japanese.
B00005JMEW|3.0|I've got to hand it to Tarantino. He blatantly rips off every anime/martial art flick imaginable and gets praised for it. I'm not saying the movie is a waste of time. Its just frustrating to know that there are anime and martial art films that are a hundred time better then this, and worth watching. Go Go was a direct rip off from Sukenban Deka, no scratch that, every shoujo anime in existence. As were all the sword fights. I am just surprised that snow fell at the end instead of cherry blossom petals. But I guess it would have been one of the two. Even the way the blood spurts is copied. Okay he could have improved it, and made it his own but nooooo, homage my ass! This movie is just about Tarantino having some fun, throwing bits of everything he likes into the mix, not caring about the end result. I mean, at least give us a reason to care about these people. If your going to do an anime sequence, make it good, memorable, not that crap, it was very sloppy. And one more thing, does Uma Thurman have the most ugliest pair of feet in existence or what! I mean Jesus, that is what you have body doubles for. And he had to zoom in on them for like 15 seconds. On the big cinema screen it's enough to put you off your popcorn, and that's with make up and probably a full pedicure as well. And Lucy Lou is completely boss eyed, is she too vain to wear glasses or something? Thank god I'm incredibly bloodthirsty. It's the only thing that kept me watching this film. There are a couple of people I would like to get revenge on as well, its fun to imagine slicing them apart with a Hanzo sword of my own.
0743490304|3.0|I am a fan of Brown's, and his other three books managed to suspend disbelief even with incredible plot lines. Deception Point, however, has the feel of a work rushed to print to take advantage of the buzz created by the DaVinci Code.  The book suffers from too many caricatures instead of characters.  Ordinarily, the reader could get past this (and simply ignore the hokey and transparent character descriptions), but a good many of these folks are important enough to the plot to call for more than two-dimensional treatment.  While the premise is interesting, and the story is structured to create the suspense that one expects from Dan Brown, this lack of character development detracts from the satisfaction that comes from really being \\"taken in\\" with a surprise ending.  (Take, for example, \\"The Poet\\", by Michael Connelly). The resolution has an arbitrary feel as a result.  Bottom line: worth a read, but not a re-read.
6304240554|3.0|DAWN OF THE DEAD follows the story that began in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Dead people are coming back to life as flesh eating zombies and no one really has any idea why. A small group of survivors, including a mall cop and a couple of news reporters, finds a refuge from the terror by boarding themselves up in a shopping mall. Zombies begin flocking to the mall in droves, but have no way of entering. Giving in to their every whim and desire, the group settles down to a fairly comfortable existence until a roving motorcycle gang finds out they have a helicopter. The motor gang has no desire to move in and live in the safety of the mall, but wants everything for their own. Their invasion of the mall brings about the film's climatic finish.<br /><br />Though the movie is fairly graphic and is a zombie flick, it's actually more of a commentary on materialism and consumerism and how it affects and infects all of us. As a commentary, the film is almost brilliant. As a zombie movie, DAWN OF THE DEAD set the bar for almost every other zombie movie to come. However, DAWN OF THE DEAD is also a movie and as a movie, it has a lot of faults. Like a Charles Dicken's novel, just about everything interesting or worthwhile that happens, occurs near the beginning and end of the movie. The middle, which should be the meat of the movie, doesn't contain much substance and the long commentary on our culture goes on too long. Nevertheless, even though the film isn't for the squeemish, DAWN OF THE DEAD is worth watching if your a fan of zombie or horror movies. Also, it's a movie that film buffs should watch just because there are very few horror films that are made that have a social context as deep as a Romero film and DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the best.
0141439785|4.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.<br /><br />In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.<br /><br />Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.<br /><br />All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy.  Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.<br /><br />Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.<br /><br />When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.<br /><br />Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.<br /><br />2004 (46) ©MYta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|Ashton Kutcher plays a college psych major who discovers he can unravel his past with the help of his journals.  As he does so, he finds he has more and more to unravel as the consequences of his meddling affect those around him.  Amy Smart is fabulous as Kutcher's girlfriend--and the one who pays the heaviest price for what he does.   <br /> <br />I found this movie to be extremely engaging.  Who wouldn't want to be able to change their past?  The plot blows along at a fast pace, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of it.  All of the supporting characters are well-played.  So few movies of this type are anything but action movies set in space/the future/the past.   <br /> <br />The DVD video transfer is excellent, but the available DTS 6.1 audio is superb!  In fact, this is one DVD to test your sound system.  Turn it up, and be prepared to jump off your couch!  This is an Infinifilm DVD, which means that you can access the special features while the movie is playing if you desire.  I don't like this feature, but you can also access them the good old-fashioned way as an extras menu.  Some of the extras on the DVD are pure horsepucky--there are pieces on chaos theory and time travel that have nothing to do with this movie.  In fact, chaos theory really has nothing to do with this movie, either, since the movie is not about small changes producing wide effect, but rather about major changes producing other focussed changes in lock-step.  I have to be vague to avoid giving away too much, but you'll see what I mean.  There is a feature that has the director/writers talking about the genesis of the film, and other things.  Although the plot is very creative, you'd think listening to this interview that nothing like this has been done before.  There is at least one Ray Bradbury story, and Ursula K LeGuin's book \\"The Lathe of Heaven\\" (which spawned two movies that I know of, neither quite worthy of the material) that do tread the same path.   <br /> <br />Both the theatrical version and the director's cut are included on the disc.  What the difference is, other than 7 minutes of additional length in the director's cut, I couldn't tell you--I only watched the director's cut.  This movie is a ride worth taking, and I found it very thought-provoking.   <br /> <br />There are scenes of animal violence that are not shown graphically, and scenes of human violence that are.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|I've seen the Chili Peppers live twice, own all of their studio recordings, own both of their live concert DVDs, and several of their CD singles/imports.<br /><br />I think it's useful to compare Live in Hyde Park with Live at Slane Castle (even though Slane is a DVD), as both are from the same tour and have similar (though not identical) setlists.<br /><br />Slane is more polished, with more post-production.  I strongly suspect that Anthony Kiedis redid some of the vocals, because his singing is in tune far more on Slane than on Off the Map, Hyde Park, or in concert in person.  Some of the musical instruments may have been re-recorded, re-processed, or otherwise touched up.  All of this gives Slane the polished sound of a studio recording.  On top of this, I would say that the band plays more conservatively on Slane than they normally do, probably because they know a concert DVD is being filmed.<br /><br />In sharp contrast, Hyde Park seems less polished, more raw, and better captures the experience of seeing the Chili Peppers live.  Anthony's voice is not always perfectly in tune.  The mix is not always perfect.  But so what?  The energy just oozes out of your speakers, through your ears, and into your brain and your heart.  Also, the playing is less conservative and more adventurous, like when you see them live.<br /><br />I still think Slane is a worthwhile purchase.  I describe it as half-way between a live concert and a studio CD.  But if you want the next best thing to seeing the Chili Peppers live, get Hyde Park.<br /><br />My other comment about Hyde Park is that it overwhelmingly focuses on Californication and later work, with only two tunes from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and nothing earlier.  This shouldn't be surprising, because they just didn't play much of the old stuff at all during the entire tour.  If you strongly prefer the older stuff, you'll be disappointed with Hyde Park.  But if you like the newer stuff pretty well, I think you'll be very happy with Hyde Park, and recommend it strongly.strongly.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The first point I would like to make is that anyone that viewed this film is responsible for the message contained in it.  This was not a film about emotion, brutallity, anti-seminism or the cruelty of Rome.  This was a power packed film about man's relationship to God.  The fact that Mr. Gibson was inspired by his own faith and relationship with God and not emotional content shows the commitment that he has and the courage to tell the story as it was.  The cinematography was excellent, the acting marvelous in light of the weighty subject depicted.  Some have said that this film is not for children or those of a frail mein.  I object and suggest that any child that has reached the age of accountability must see this film so that they can make their own mind up about this event.  The weak or frail that are looking for the moment of ultimate truth must see this film.  If we look at this film and judge it by the same standard that we judged \\"King of Kings\\" starring Jeffrey Hunter or the \\"Bible\\" with an all star cast then I believe that we miss the point entirely.  Mel Gibson is the first director in Hollywood that has the intestinal fortitude (guts) to tell the story as it really happened and please note that often those accused of a capital crime did not survive the scouraging in order to be crucified.  God's wrath was not the object of this movie either.  Why would God willing send His own son to a horrifying death in order to redeem mankind and then take it out on the very humanity that that death was planned for before Adam and Eve were even created.  That would be tantamount to murder. There is much debate about the false doctrine of \\"Evaloution\\" and I submit that this film in all it's cinematic gore and brutallity forces a decision to be made by everyone that sees it.  The fact that Mel Gibson invested 33 million dollars of his own finances into this project shows dedication, sacrifice & commitment.  Don't forget that those that would not support Gibson financially, now wish that they had, since the movie has made approximately 100 times Mel's investment.  Hollywood would rather pervert the Gospels (good news) and portray Jesus Christ as a man with homosexual tendicies than tell the truth, for obvious reasons.  It appeared to me that even the cast of this film was changed by it.  In summary \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is the focal point, the pivital point in the relationship between God and man and the attemps throughout the ages of the \\"evil one\\" Satan formerly Lucifer \\"Son of the Morning\\" and the chief archangel of God, to thwart God's plan to redeem (buy back) man from sin and bondage to this current world system.  If you miss this point of the film then you reduce the \\"Passion\\" to entertainment and that diminishes all of humanity.  I don't care if you are a believer of not, the healthy do not need the services of a doctor, but the unhealthy do.  Mel Gibson made a film about a choice between heaven and hell and everyone that sees this film will be held accountable for what they now know are the facts.  The cinematography, look and feel of the sets was tangible and unforgettable.  The acting was very moving and well done.  The wardrobe was very well done and the music was paced right in time with the sequence of events.  This movie is a must see for all seekers of truth.ly, now wish that they had, since the movie has made approximately 100 times Mel's investment.

B00005JMUA|4.0|I have seen many different aspects on this great movie; the most distinctive difference comes from how to define Volume 2: <br /> <br />A. To consider Volume 2 as the second half of the whole story, or <br />B. To consider Volume 2 as the sequence story after Volume 1. <br /> <br />If the fans agree with A, they will give great credit for this movie; but from B, the movie will be rated badly.  I think it is unfair to compare the two parts, it is like to compare which is more important to you: your mom or your wife?  These two parts contains very different elements, without either part, the story is not complete. <br /> <br />In the Volume 1, Tarantino blends samurai sword combating, animation, Bruce Lee style dressing, black and white, montage, and some other effects satisfied, or spoiled movie goers.  These are never been showing in Hollywood movie, yet these are very common in Japanese and Hong Kong's kung fu movies.  I couldn't deny such combination is a great idea and it brings us something the western fans never seen before.  At the end of Volume 1, there are still too many questions to be answered.  Why Bill and gangs have to kill the Bride? Why Elle hate the Bride that way?  Why Bill still wants to kill the Bride even he knows she has his baby?  If these questions are not answered, Volume 1 is only the show off of fighting, no story at all. <br /> <br />Volume 2 means a lot to the whole story: it turns the ACTION movie into DRAMA.  With volume 2, the story is complete.  The whole Volume 2 is full of story, plot, and Tarantino style talking.  The action scenes are comparatively fewer than Volume, yet the fighting between Bride and Elle, and the story of Pai Mei, still enrich the action element of this movie. <br /> <br />The story ends with hugging her daughter in a motel watching TV, it is so close to our daily life.  I suddenly feel that I am so lucky, I can enjoy my family life without killing so hard.  This is an Odysseus ending: to go through extreme danger and great risk, the only wish is to return to family.  The movie also shows the greatness of the normal people like our kind. <br /> <br />This is a 5-star movie to me, and will be on top of my list for a long time.  The reason why I only rate 4 stars simply because the 2 volumes cost me twice to enjoy it, both in theatre and on DVD.  I can not send a protest letter to Miramax, so I give it 1 less star out of 5. <br /> <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Writer-director Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\" is an exquisite gem of a movie. It is her love letter to the city of Tokyo, which the breathtaking cinematography captures in all of its garish glory. \\"Lost in Translation\\" more than fulfills the promise made by Coppola's first directorial effort, \\"The Virgin Suicides,\\" and shows that she is a major new filmmaker with a voice all of her own.<br /><br />Bill Murray has given many memorable performances in his career, but he may never top is work here. Murray was deservedly Oscar nominated for his performance as Bob Harris, a lonely washed-up movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Bob's career and his marriage have gone sour; on the phone calls home his wife and children are barely interested in him. Murray's best moments come when he seems to be unaware that he's acting, when the camera turns to his face and it is filled with such profound sadness it breaks your heart. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is filled with many tiny moments like this, moments that make up real life but are seldom captured so effectively on film.<br /><br />Suffering from insomnia in the lonely Tokyo hotel, Bob meets the twentysomething Charlotte, played with beautiful subtlety and grace by Scarlett Johansson. Charlotte has been married for two years to a video director who hardly acknowledges her presence. Charlotte is alone and drifting, and in the night she and Bob strike up a friendship. Those expecting a May-December love story are watching the wrong film. Bob and Charlotte have many late night conversations about what life means to them, and they relate to one another in a very precious way.<br /><br />Murray and Johansson play this unique relationship perfectly, making you see the humanity of Bob and Charlotte, how in their loneliness they reach out and touch one another's lives. It is a bond that probably could not exist in the world outside of their hotel, and they know it. So Bob and Charlotte spend all of the time they can with each other, but eventually it must end. The ending to \\"Lost in Translation\\" is oner of the best I have ever seen in film. It is perfect. As Bob is leaving to return to his family, he leans in and whispers something into Charlotte's ear. We are not allowed to hear what he says, and it's better that way.<br /><br />Bob and Charlotte part company knowing that they have shared something very special that has changed their lives. In the darkness of midnight Tokyo, two lost people found one another, and it is wondrous to watch. This is a very moody, quiet, beautiful film. You may get antsy because of the slow pace, but stick with it. You will be rewarded with the miracle of Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's Oscar-winning achievement.can with each other, but eventually it must end.

B000084T18|1.0|Owns a multi million dollar album and doesnt deserve a penny.Rate it in negative stars if possible. <br />Pointless lyrics, crummy vocals , no instrumental talent = no talent at all. If you want to see talent look into some hard rock or heavy metal. Awesome lyrics, alot of good vocals, and insane instrumental talent.
B0002EXH5E|5.0|well i love the effort Dave put into this remixing and remaster. I mean it actually sounds like a four man honest to God instruments and real vocals band sound...verses the semi band and semi synth sound the previous version had...there were solos i hadn't heard before and fill solos that were overtaken by the damn techno effects before and i don't know ...it just sounds a little more real and you can truly hear the difference in Insomnia and i still really love the song The Doctor's Calling...so over all i give it a 9/10 rating
6303402348|5.0|Forrest Gump is just one of those films where everything falls perfectly into place, making it an instant classic.  No matter what your preference in movies; humor, action, romance...Forrest Gump covers them all, splendidly.  Released by Paramount Pictures in 1994 and running 142 minutes, Forrest Gump was directed by Robert Zemeckis.  Zemeckis' starting line up consists of Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn and Sally Field.  Not too shabby.  The film won numerous awards, too many to mention here, but topping the list were Oscars won for Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Effects.  The film follows Tom Hanks as a young boy named Forrest, with just a bit of a learning disibility, and his life growing up.  Along the way, he runs into many characters, some well known, and in one form or another, slightly or greatly impacts the lives of each one.  Where Forrest lacks in mental capabilities, he more than makes up for in his thoughts and actions, which are ruled by his heart.  Forrest Gump combines all things nessacary to make this an all-inclusive film.  From the music of the 50's, 60's and 70's to the special effects and storyline itself, there will be something for everyone.  This film deserves 5 stars across the board for its power to make you laugh, cry, learn and hope!
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie was EXCELLENT!!! It was missing some stuff from the book, some IMPORTANT stuff but overall it kicked much booty. Kudos to David Thewlis and Gary Oldman for their amazing roles as Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, Welcome to the Harry Potter Family guys!. Definatly buy this!
