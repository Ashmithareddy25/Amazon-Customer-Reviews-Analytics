B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow<br />This was an amazing ending to an amazing story, ending only the way a truly memorable book can. I will read it again and again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Until the last page, I would have given this book five stars. Not a fan of the ending. It builds and builds into this completely unsatisfying conclusion.
B008OOYALE|5.0|First online game for my Kindle. Really enjoy the strategy of creating the Dragon islands. The challenge of breeding the various dragons is intriguing. Enjoy the interaction with other players who become neighbors in the community.  The layout and instructions are clear and easy to follow.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I decided to give Psycho five stars for a number of reasons.  First of all, the blu-ray transfer of this classic Hitchcock film exceeded all expectations, with superb sound quality and stunning image quality.  The actors and the sets are just so full of life in this HD version.  Alfred Hitchcock was a man who perfected the art of suspense, and even after all these years it does not cease to terrify.  I was on the edge of my seat from the minute Marion Crane pulled into the Bates Motel.  The characters are so believable, and every actor did a phenomenal job.  Anthony Perkins portrayed Norman Bates with aggression, but he also held back from taking the character into a place where the audience would no longer sympathize with him--the best villians are the ones that you feel sorry for, and Norman Bates is at the very top.  All in all, Psycho is a beautifully wicked film, with gorgeous shots and fantastic acting!!!!!!!
0425263908|3.0|It was too much like Grays to be exciting.  Just ok, not going to buy the next 2 in trilogy.<br />.
0385486804|3.0|Have you ever thought of escaping from the technological advancements and complexities in today's society?  In the biographical book, Into the Wild, by Jon Krakauer, a young college student by the name of Christopher McCandless, abandons his college life to experience the joys and hardships of the wild. However, with the lack of adequate supplies and proper survival knowledge, McCandless takes his voyage to a new level.<br /><br />Like many young men, McCandless wanted to be free of society's restraints. As a child, McCandless was always adventurous and stubborn to his own ideals and beliefs. His daring personality and perseverance led him to an &#34;epic journey that would change everything&#34; (Krakauer 18). Despite his determination, McCandless' recklessness ultimately led to his demise in the Alaskan wilderness and thus Krakauer's tale begins.<br /><br /> By starting the book with the death of a mysterious young man, Krakauer cleverly pushes the readers to shares the same belief of many who read McCandless' story in the magazine, Outisde. In fact, one Alaskan who read this magazine states that McCandless' situation was &#34;just another case of underprepared, overconfident men bumbling around out there and screwing up because they lacked the requisite humility&#34; (51). However, as the story unfolds, Krakauer hints that there is something special about McCandless, and informs the readers that McCandless is an intelligent man and was well-liked by the people who met him. As readers learn more about McCandless, this young man seems to be unique as he gave up his seemingly successful life.<br /><br />Krakauer's unique style of beginning the book of McCandless' death allows the readers to be in the shoe of any other person who would have simply read an article about McCandless. This technique proves to be effective as the readers are able to have similar opinion of McCandless as those of his time and be able to gain more knowledge about McCandless' odyssey further on in the book. Despite the effectiveness of this writing strategy, the fact that Krakauer gave the ending of the story in the first few chapters wasn't to my favor. I would have preferred it if I was capable of rooting McCandless' on in his journey and hope that McCandless would survive. Without the suspense as to whether or not McCandless would survive his journey, this novel seemed a little empty to me.<br /><br />  Like McCandless, I hope to one day escape from the realities of society and just live a primitive lifestyle in the wilderness. Despite the similar desire to live off the land, I do not have the same courage and determination to abandon the luxuries of society. This book made me realize that even &#34;if you want something badly enough, it is [not necessarily] your God-given right to have it&#34; (106). I now understand that perseverance and determination are important in achieving a goal, but the goal may not be accomplished no matter how hard I try.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this book a 3.5 out of 5. I would probably not reread this book in the near future. Rather than seeing this written piece as a regular book, I perceive it as a long extension of the Outside magazine Krakauer formerly published. I would recommend this book to those who love adventure, or those who would love to just read an easy book about the carelessness of a young man who sought an Alaskan adventure.<br /><br /> McCandless' journey was truly an &#34;an odyssey in the fullest sense of the word&#34; (18).  Nonetheless, his voyage ultimately led to his death, despite his desire to once again unite with civilization. So, the next time you decide to explore the wilderness or run away from home, always remember to bring the necessary supplies or you might regret it later on.ffectiveness of this writing strategy, the fact that Krakauer gave the ending of the story in the first few chapters wasn't to my favor.

055358202X|5.0|Very detailed, great series.  Recommend this for anyone who likes elaborate and detailed stories. Game of Thrones is one on the best series I have read.
0307887898|5.0|The best aspect of this book is the validity of the concepts.  I am a Lean Project Manager who has applied the &#34;Lessons Learned&#34; in The Lean Startup.  The proscribed process works, period.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This is a great application where the measurements are critical. This is perfect for the person who is a better carpenter than a mathmatician. It is very easy to use.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis has given us an indepth look into the opaque world of finance. This is a documented history that has the &#34;fear factor&#34; of a Stephen King novel. The unfolding of the creation of a financial instrument that takes a &#34;turd' and polishs it until it sparkles like gold and is sold like gold.  The book gives an insight into the untimate cause of the colapse of the world's financial system. It reveals how a few people can cause world wide destruction of finances.  It details the use of  &#34;sub-standard&#34; loans and how the papers were manipulated to appear to be a safe and profitable investment.  The many institutions involved in this creation makes &#34;trust&#34; a word not to be applied to these major institutions.  Let's hope the book can enlighten the public and maybe prevent this disguised &#34;Ponzi&#34; scheme from re-occuring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun for kids... parents too.  Recent update included some nice changes and content.  I highly recommend this game.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Excellent notes and study helps make learning from the Scriptures an in-depth experience. The notes cut through the fluff and give solid exposition to enable true, deep, spiritual growth. Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and I love taking care of my horses. I also like how u can play the game without using real money. Definitely a fun game for the whole family
1451695195|4.0|Must read,  Very inspiring. Would recommend book to all faiths. Extremely thought provoking and timely. I am anxious to read other books by this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought it for my grandson who is seven.  Has been a very good mind building tool for him.  Would much rather he play with that then the angry games.  Puts his imagination to work.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Game is very similar to console versions with most function abilities intact. I have not noticed any glaring issues that are worth complaining about.
B009CGLO3K|5.0|You can always count on charlize theron to give an amazing performance in any role. Chris \\"Thor\\" Hemsworth is as dreamy as ever and gave a great performance as well in this very different role. Kristen Stewart is onr dimensional so expect the same, one expression for every emotion from her. But the movie was great and so was were the special effects.
B0026IUXME|5.0|One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. Takes your breath away. There are moments of tragic violence (this should be expected from a Holocaust movie). But the sadness is worth the message and unbelievable performances.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book with a lot of good advice! If you need some help in the relationship department or if you just need a little help in life then this is def the book for you! Enjoy!
B00E8B1358|3.0|It's missing something. Kind of tame for a gi joe movie and moves at a predictable pace. No pizzaz. Thanks
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was very fun puzzle game I really enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one! I recommend this game.
B002APU580|5.0|I loved the movie. It gives flesh and bones to the book and to see the emotions played out in the movie makes the book come alive for me.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  I love it.  I love the story. Now I can't wait until Season 2
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Really like this show.  Shows the old British caste system and I really like that, as I find the juxtaposition of the &#34;servant&#34; class vs the aristocracy one of the interesting aspects of this show.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movie was truly amazing. It was just paced so well and I couldn't look away, despite it being disturbing. It's truly a high cinematic achievement.
B006RXQ6FM|5.0|Meryl Streep really lives her role whatever it is. The movie is tense and thought provoking. We really enjoyed it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Mr. Hosseini writes about pain and redemption once again.  Parts are very poignant and moving, and some sections seem to be a bit disjointed, but nevertheless, I loved it.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This game is one of many that I have chosen to down load from the same developer.  Good job on the game but needs more characters.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Aronofsky is a very versatile film-maker, just like Stanley Kubrick. It still has Aronofsky's signature all over it but it's his first take on the psychological thriller genre. Very moody film, innovative camerawork and stylistic decisions, and of course a great performance from Portman.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very easy to play.  I love the Hint option.  The ads are annoying, but easy to get out of. So far I have only done two different color decks.  One day I'll get venture-some and try four!
B008YF4BIU|5.0|I have read this book three times and buy it to give to others.  Ms. Eadie's message is quite profound and helps me to 'not sweat the small stuff'.
B00E8B1358|2.0|I was expecting more. Although I really enjoy Dwayne Johnson and Ray Park movies, I thought the movie jumped around too much. The beginning was very disappointing and I was waiting for a major character to return.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Got the movie Oz the great & powerful very quickly there was a cut through the box and case the movie was in the cut was also through the packaging lead me to be of the thinking the the post office did it during processing
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved the story before I saw recent film. I fell even more in love. It's dramatic and moving. The way they recorded the singers/actors during the scenes adds a dimension of feeling you don't get on a standard musical film's studio recording. It's much more emotional and real.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Its just not smooth and fast on my note 2. Not to mention the fact that it took forever to do an initial load.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Movie was good but Blu ray disc skipped in parts! Interesting story line about the origin of Earth and Inter planetary Space travel, etc.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|Actors are phenomenal.<br />Cinematography is beautiful.<br />Message is realistic and comforting and lovely.<br /><br />Watch it, you guys. You won't regret it.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Have enjoyed all Lois McMaster Bujold Vorkosigan novels and this one is another good one. The scenery and description of various personalities are excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun.  It is challenging but a blast at the same time.  I think it's great for all ages.  My kids love the minions.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It took me awhile to discover this show. I read an article about it in Entertainment Weekly a couple of months ago and I was sold because of the outstanding reviews.<br />I watched season 1 and season 2 with Amazon on my smart TV. I am so happy I did. It is the most impressive show I have seen in some time. Intelligent, witty and fun. All of the actors are amazing talents and one character is more intriguing than the next. I will be a loyal fan for as long as this little gem of a show is on the air.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|this is a stupid ripoff and a waste of money a lot of money I might add don't waste your time and money on this stupid rip off
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome job of making this game AMAZING! I LOVE IT ITS A GOOD THING FOR ME TO LIKE IT I DON'T USUALLY HAVE FUN PLAYING GAMES LIKE THIS
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot and it gave me some great insight as I train for my first 50K as well as a lot of motivation!
1849531986|5.0|If this book had a lot of words than it would confound and confuse all the dummies who order it because they think it easy reading.  Really, it is perfect for those people who found third grade a little too challenging.
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|The first was wayyyy better, this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Mars and a completely different story line. It's (never thought I would say it) way too fast paced to the point of you can get up go to the bathroom, grab a snack, read an article from the newspaper and come back to the movie and not miss much at all because people will still be throwing punches and running.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|I HAVE SEEN IT MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THE SAME EVERY TIME. KIND OF SAD. DID MY TOUR IN 66/67 BEFORE IT WENT REALLY SOUR.
1564148793|4.0|Was a little advanced but had some good things in it . I would recomened it to my friends that are into this.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is great! Very challenging and fun. It really makes you think and sometimes stumps you! I definitely recommend this app!!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I absolutely love this game. It's very strategic. The only fault I found it's how hard it is to get DNA points in the harder levels. We should be able to buy them.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is too addictive, I just downloaded at 12:00 and I think I just played fifty games. This game is really fun, and guess what u don't have to have a FB account Lol. There's alot of competitive people out there so HURRY and download this game, well I gotta play bye guys :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Heart warming, mind expanding story of his experience!  Grateful that he has the courage to share what happened to him. So good, so exciting to understand how this world works.
1118109791|5.0|it is a textbook, what more can i say. It is the one I needed and I got it. Thank you!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Such a great app. It really makes you think and is very addictive. Meanwhile, there is a little, teensy-weensy problemo, without the update you can't go past Level 10.  :(
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Ron Fricke is the only director whose movies I will buy sight unseen, collecting made easier by his 20-year moviemaking schedule. Samsara continues his explorations of the earth and humanity begun in Koyaanisqatsi and Chronos, and continued in the landmark film Baraka. Each film speaks with Fricke's voice in a different way, with the earliest Chronos being quite abstract and Samsara having what might almost be called a plot (Koyaanisqatsi was Fricke's cinematography and Godfrey Reggio's concepts). For a film having only visuals and music, Samsara becomes nearly political at times, with strong graphic statements about our cultures of guns and industrial agriculture, and some of the scenes are hard to watch (and liable to make one a vegetarian). But there is also an abundance of stunning landscapes and multilayered examinations of human religions and motivations. Like Baraka, the Blu Ray disk is an incredible reproduction of the 70mm film, and you'll wish you had a bigger screen (no matter how big it is), with a precise soundtrack that envelopes the room with sound. It is a showpiece for home theatre equipment, and an excellent continuation of Fricke's exploration of nature and culture.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I love this CD.  It has all of the hits  and if you are a huge fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons then you won't be disappointed!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I can't believe this but I haven't been able to bring myself to finish this book.  It is just slow in the beginning.  I'll get to the end eventually because I want to see the movie.<br />Okay I finished and it got a little better but it was still mediocre.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really really really really like this game.  , I love mysterious things and this will definitely keep you wanting to play it often. . I also love the fact that it's free .
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved the beginning of this book, but the author keeps introducing new characters and revisiting old minor characters and jumping back and forth through time and location until I just didn't care any more.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|I got this a while ago and just want to say... There's still people who love Atari! My dad loves Atari remembers a lot of the games on this app. To all the people who rated 1star because of the controls, be a smart person and change them, it gives you the option to! Anyway, this is really fun. I had something like this for the Playstation and remember what some of the games were like, and they're just like this! The gameplay's amazing, and I got a great deal on 100 classic video games! I love how you can change the controls for each game. I have one thing though, I'm missing multiplayer on some of my favorite games and it'd be way better with leaderboards. They say, &quot;coming soon&quot; but when's soon? So please fill in the blanks and make this app even better than it already is!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app for my kids and their friends.  I don't have to worry with the younger ones whether it is appropiate or not while the older kids love it too.  So now when can my husband squeeze in some play time:-)
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Love the Piano Guys music! Have listened to the PianoGuys 2 Deluxe Edition CD alot!  I just wish they had more music out to buy!!!
0307744434|3.0|i appreciated the author's ambition and imagination, but I found the tap-dancing through time confusing and, ultimately, irritating.  The author needed an editor who<br />followed the &#34;less is more&#34; principle.  Too many characters, too much description, too, too everything.  This talented author should rein herself in next time.  But it's her first book - the next will be better.
0061438294|4.0|This book is written by an ex-FBI agent and is written as so. It can be a little bland, but the info he gives is very helpful. I wish he has explained a little more in depth on a few of the body languages he points out but I was satisfied with this introduction to the field. Great book to give you an overview and get you noticing peoples body language. Has helped me in my personal relationships a few times already.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|its doesent feel heavy on my wrist, i like the look, idont have to replace batterys or wind it, ...AND A GREAT PRICE&#62;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is fun for all ages! It's got some clean humor based off of an extremely cute movie. The only thing I don't like is the currency. Not the bananas, but the coins. I think one should be able to obtain them without actually purchasing them. Who wants to spend real money on fake currency?
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|Im a horror fan, a sam raimi fan, and an evil dead fan. That said, i wish i hadnt bought into all the hype around this so-so remake. Its just not very good: the acting, special effects, and plot are so weak im amazed that this is getting all the fanfare it is. Ill admit that there is a glut of low- budget horror crap out there and Evil Dead is better than most of it, but that doesnt mean its good. If i hadnt read or heard a thing about it beforehand, i probably would have enjoyed it more- but since i HAD been eagerly anticipating it and read up on it in advance- i was really let down. 6/10 at MOST
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love  the game! It would be nice if they would let you play without needing so many coins. I would probably keep playing if I didn't have to pay for more coins. They don't give you enough to begin with.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I always liked candy crush on my moms iphone so i thought I'd get it on my kindle fire hd so thats what i did but it takes so long to download and im only eleven so i want it to download really fast!!!!#!
006114665X|4.0|How is it that the truth has been kept from us for so long? The ramifications of this war still shape our world today. Perhaps the Russian revolution has caused us to temper our view of her culpability in this shameful episode.
B00164CM46|5.0|This is probably the third time I've bought this movie, as I have often lent it out and just ended up buying another copy. The flow of the movie is spot on and it is a great background movie to throw on while you are doing whatever. The music will put you in a better mood.
0525478817|5.0|Awesome book, looking forward to reading again. Totally recommend it to anyone looking for a good entertaining read. , ,
B00992CF6W|3.0|When I played this game it crashed on my Kindle twice and I mean it took me to the Kindle fire page and was frozen for 15 mins or more. Unfortunately I had to delete the game from my device but it was fun while it worked.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great but it keeps on doing stuff you never did after a while. It also upset the rest of the apps to. Get it if you want a temporary out of order kindle fire hd
1451695195|3.0|It wasn't what I expected but it was o.k.<br />The way it was written was over my head.<br />It did not keep my interest.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|How, on earth, this box set is less expensive than the awful other Star Wars trilogy (episodes 1-3) is beyond me.  Great quality, my kids love it.
B00439MV42|5.0|I love the back to the future movies! It rocks!!!! This movie ends the series and is great. Well worth the money.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game until the update... it takes forever to load and i cant ever play it... it takes too long... left it loading for an hour and it never finished...
B007DIQC90|5.0|Iceland group. They are good. Pound for pound Iceland has more rock-n-roll groups than anyone on Earth.<br /><br />They have it all in under 500k population.<br /><br />Amazing culture. They are the whitest nation on Earth.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|In a quest to save my marriage and not being one to give up hope,this book was an eye opener,reading it just makes sense, you find yourself saying  \\"why didn't I see that\\" A must read if you care about your spouse and want to feel loved again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|the upgrade on my kindle fire stalls<br />.<br /><br />  the original app was fun and useful.  The upgrade doesn't have as much info and stalls kindle fire.  I uninstalled it.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|This is a non brainer film that entertains. The opening is powerful stuff.<br /><br />Slick, exaggerated, basically action film (no sentence)<br /><br />This ain't David Mamet.<br /><br />Missed it the movies because I did not get my butt.
1451695195|5.0|From the moment I started the book until the end it was totally captivating.  If Dr. Alexander's story does not make one think and examine their own beliefs then they are lost.  His intent was to not gain notoriety but to wake-up people and to not let the fear of death get in the way of one's living.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|What a thrill ride of a read. Combining science with action and a a little romance. I can see this as an action movie for sure! Just like with Dan Brown I always learn a lot when reading Rollins.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This book was a good read with a lot of twists and turns. Many surprises that keep you wondering what's next.
B00466HNHM|5.0|I always loved this movie and wanted to update it to my Blu-ray collection and glad I did . It is very nice .
B000002L68|5.0|This album came out as I just got my first girlfriend when I was 14. This was our album. Love the music.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Excellent! Read This Book. It has a wonderful story and characters. So engaging. I wanted to know what would happen next. The ending was perfect and I was sorry when it ended. More, please.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|The usual range of folksy Renaissance to hard rocking selections with a twist of eastern European thrown in.  Nice addition for any fan.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|It has been years since i have seen this and I had forgotten what a great movie it was. Great for the whole family
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|Some of the shows were only slightly better than average, but the overall story, character development and the way they finished off the last season was well above any other series I've ever seen.  The way they turned one of the characters to the &#34;dark side&#34; was believable, and could be a lesson to the creators of Star Wars and how poorly Vader was turned to the dark side.  There were no weak or annoying actors, and I was impressed that they didn't have to use harsh language nor show blood and gore as a crutch for entertainment like most Hollywood productions do.  Excellent, and extremely well done.  Bravo to everyone involved in the production!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Awesome book a must read. I love Egyptian mythology now as well as Greek and Roman. Rick Riordan is a genius.
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|Amazing cast, gripping direction both make this one of the best thrillers I've seen outside of Hitchcock of course.  This director takes quite a few lessons from the master as a matter of fact. I suspect Rooney Mara will get an Oscar nomination for her part.

059306495X|5.0|'I Am Pilgrim' by Terry Hayes is an outstanding, exceptional piece of work.<br />It opens in a hotel room in New York, at the scene of a rather gruesome murder of a woman found in a bathtub.<br /><br />Pilgrim is the codename of a man who doesn’t exist, but here he is at the request of a friend to attend and help him with the investigation.<br />Whilst surveying the crime scene it becomes evident that the perpetrator may have used a criminal forensic investigation book as a reference to  assist with the a murder. Intreagingly a book  that just happens to have been written by Pilgrim.<br /><br />'I Am Pilgrim' by Terry Hayes is an outstanding, exceptional piece of work.<br /><br />I didn't know anything about the book before I read it and don't want to spoil it for other readers but suffice to say that the reader is in for a tremendous fast paced, action packed thriller.  Hayes takes us on an exciting journey from London, Paris, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia to the Hindu Kush, on an international manhunt to find the killer and to thwart a plot to bring down the House of Saad, the Saudi Arabian Royal family, and destruction of the USA.<br /><br />Pilgrim is a witty, intelligent, quiet unassuming character that I liked very much.  I found all the characters intensely interesting.  Hayes’ style of writing is slick, taut and intense and at times pretty gruesome.  Some scenes are incredibly emotive and you find yourself believing in and caring about the  characters.  During one section set in Jeddah I was really moved, and horrified as the scene unfolded, and by the emotional destruction of those affected. The transitions between character to character and their associated stories is seamless and flawlessly managed.<br /><br />This is the first spy thriller I have read, but in the post 9/11,  Iraq and Afganistan world we live in, I, as  are many other people,  am a little more aware that governments and intelligence agencies are working in the background to seek and intercept acts of terrorism.  Having also lived in Saudi Arabia, with an interest, and a little understanding of the politics of that country,  I find this a credible and frighteningly plausible tale.<br /><br />The 700 pages just flew by and I never lost interest, even slightly.  'I Am Pilgrim' is my absolute favourite read this year and I would certainly recommend it to family, friends and any thriller enthusiast or novice as in my case, without reservation.<br />This is Hayes debut novel and I will definitely keep a look out for more by him including the film !<br />I absolutely loved it !

B00B4VXQC8|3.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan for a long time but this album was a disappointment to me. I only LIKE two or three songs. I don't love any of them. Several I just skip past. I know this has been a successful album for the band but I think that's just because people like me bought it because we always buy their albums. In fact, while waiting in line at the Bon Jovi concert, a group of people behind me in line said they didn't like it either but bought it so they were familiar with the music before going to the concert. Sorry Bon Jovi, but I am still a big fan!

B00DWZHTOU|4.0|Now You See Me (2013)<br />****<br /><br />Four magicians, each with a very different shtick, (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher (\\"Wedding Crashers\\", \\"The Lookout\\") and Dave Franco (\\"Warm Bodies\\", \\"21 Jump Street\\") receive Tarot cards directing them to a run-down apartment in Brooklyn. After a few moments of general confusion (\\"oh, you're here as well?\\") they uncover the plans for an elaborate magic illusion. Fast forward and the group is now headlining in Vegas as The Four Horseman. Their sponsor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) watches with disinterest from the audience. Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and his assistant also sit quietly in the audience, filming the entire show; Thaddeus has made a career of debunking the claims and magic of popular acts. The group calls a random audience member to the stage and manages to transport him, to the interior of his bank's vault, in Paris, where he grabs millions of euros just before they begin to rain down on the audience in Vegas. Enter reluctant FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who is called in to investigate. But the Four Horsemen are quickly released and move on to their next venue, New Orleans and their next illusion.<br /><br />Thus begins \\"Now You See Me\\", a very fast-paced, well-made caper film directed by Louis Letterier (\\"The Transporter\\", \\"Taken\\") and written by Ed Solomon and Boaz Yakim. \\"See Me\\" is a fun, easy to watch film perfect for the summer popcorn crowd.  The film is not without problems; there are a few too many third act plot twists which aren't established enough to connect to the rest of the story. While this does detract from the overall effort, the rest of the film is good enough to help you overlook this.<br /><br />\\"See Me\\" is also a very slick film, which is both good and bad. As the narrative barrels along, it keeps us interested, but it doesn't provide a lot of time for character development. As each of the characters is introduced, we get a brief moment showing us a little of their lives, but that is pretty much it. J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is in Vegas captivating a crowd of pretty young women; he is putting the moves on one of the girls in his swanky bachelor pad when he realizes he has the Tarot card. Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is doing hypnosis tricks at Caf&eacute; du Monde in New Orleans when he gets his card. Henley Reeves (Fisher) is performing an elaborate escape act, complete with a straitjacket and piranhas, in a Los Angeles club. Jack Wilder (Franco) is doing cheap tricks for a group of tourists on a New York ferry, trying to scam them out of a tenner. When they initially meet at the address in Brooklyn, we learn some know each other, some have heard of others, but that is it. When they uncover the secret plans, they are captivated and the narrative shifts forward a year and we rejoin them as the Four Horsemen.<br /><br />Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\") enters the picture after the illusion involving the French bank and tags along with Dylan. But they always seem to be one step behind the clever magicians.<br /><br />Letterier, the director of \\"Clash of the Titans (2010)\\", \\"The Incredible Hulk (2008)\\" and \\"The Transporter\\" films is a director who seems intent on creating summer popcorn films, films filled with fast-paced action, lots of special effects and little or no character development. \\"The Transporter\\" films were a blast, but since then Letterier has had difficulty finding the right balance. In \\"Now You See Me\\", the director uses great CGI to almost convince us the magicians are performing real illusions. Unfortunately, because the CGI is so good, it isn't believable. And the late-in-the-narrative explanation of how the magic was possible just doesn't cut it either.<br /><br />In \\"See Me\\", Letterier seems to have found the right vehicle for his limited storytelling skills. I only wish he had been able to create a little bit of character development, fleshing out the performances to make them more interesting. In a way, because the production values are so high, the lack of character development is more noticeable and makes the film seem unbalanced and the experience seem hollow. Learning something, anything about them would forge a stronger connection with the viewer and make us care about them just a little more. Note to all filmmakers; even the smallest amount of character development will improve your film immensely.<br /><br />Generally, if we don't learn specifically about the characters, their actions and the plot will lead us to learn something about them. But the four magicians are following a detailed set of instructions and seem clueless as to their purpose or the final outcome. So, that doesn't work either.<br /><br />Rhodes (Ruffalo) is reluctantly paired with Alma. As they chase the magicians, we see a relationship building between them, but this is the only one in the entire film. And they aren't the central characters - I'm not sure anyone could be considered the star, there are too many people running around, playing a part  - so it seems odd to be given more information about these characters than others.<br /><br />My biggest problem with \\"See Me\\" is there are too many third-act plot twists. The key to a good plot twist is there needs to be a subtle hint or connection to something we have witnessed earlier. The best plot twists involve something you have seen, but no longer remember. When the twist happens, a light goes off in your head. \\"Oh, yeah.\\" In \\"See Me\\", there just aren't connections to the many, many twists. If they are there, they are too subtle. Because these moments seem to simply materialize out of thin air, the movie's credibility wanes and wobbles and quickly devolves into a bad episode of \\"Murder She Wrote\\".<br /><br />I know the problems don't really seem small or insignificant, but when weighed against the overall effect of the entire film, they seem to be less important. Maybe Letterier has created an illusion of his own?<br /><br />\\"Now You See Me\\" is a fun bit of fantasy, perfect to help you make a few hours disappear.<br /><br />Get ready for a sequel.formances to make them more interesting.

B008JFUQZ2|5.0|\\"Pacific Rim\\", the new film from writer/director Guillermo Del Toro (\\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"Hellboy\\") is very simply the film we all hope to see every time we go to the movies during the summer. It is, with one small exception, the perfect summer film.<br /><br />Every summer, the studios overhype their biggest bets and get the movie going public excited about films that will probably end up letting us down. From the sequel with too many special effects and little or no character development to the endless big screen adaptations of super heroes and countless attempts to scare us with gory humor or gross out comedy, these films are usually missing at least one element to make them something special, something to care about, something to remember. Usually, that element is balance; special effects are good but need to be balanced by character development and narrative.<br /><br />But \\"Pacific Rim\\" isn't a sequel, has great special effects, great action, a believable and interesting backstory and significant character development. If there is anything to criticize, it does use a tried and true formulaic set-up for the ending. But the rest of the film is so good; this can and should be overlooked.<br /><br />The film opens a few years into the Kaiju War. A few years back, giant space aliens begin to invade Earth through a rift in the Pacific Rim. These monsters begin to attack our cities, killing untold millions of people and causing catastrophic destruction. Governments join forces and form an alliance combining resources to figure out how to battle these monsters. The solution? Jaegers - large robots manned by two pilots who are connected via a mind probe operating the large robots as a team. The Jaegers are dispatched from a number of stations located around the Pacific. And the program works until the Kaiju start to learn. And start to win again. Flash forward a few years, and the program is going to be shut down. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the leader of the program recruits a number of the best Jaeger pilots to lead one last ditch attempt to get rid of them once and for all. He brings everyone to Hong Kong, the last operational station, to join Dr. Geiszler (Charlie Day, TV's \\"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\\"), who believes he can do a mind meld with one of the Kaiju, Gottlieb (Burn Gorman, TV's \\"Torchwood\\"), the crazy inventor who comes up with the equipment they need and Ops Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.) who is the man in charge of guiding the missions. One of the pilots Stacker brings to Hong Kong is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) who has been living incognito for a few years, since his last mission failed and his co-pilot died. When the team is assembled, they begin to realize certain things about the Kaiju and come up with a plan to end the invasion once and for all. Stacker is forced to team Raleigh with a trainee, Mako (Rinko Kinkuchi), his own prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but watches them very closely to see if they can handle the assignment.<br /><br />I admire Guillermo Del Toro. He was clearly influenced by fantasy and sci-fi films as a kid and has devoted his career as a filmmaker to create more films to add to this genre. This early influence seems to drive him to make more interesting and unusual films, films that test the boundaries of these genres. As a director, he brings an incredible depth of detail to the composition of his films, layering images and ideas, creating something for the viewer to feast on, much like the creatures feast on their victims in many of his films. He has also used his newfound clout in Hollywood to produce and `Present\\" a number of projects from other filmmakers - his hand has been in everything from animation to genre horror. While these films are more interesting and unusual because of his involvement, the films he directs are the special ones, the ones to keep an eye out for.<br /><br />In \\"Pacific Rim\\", he and his team create an incredible backstory, smartly placing us in themiddle of the action. Brief voiceover from Raleigh gets us up to speed and then we join him on a battle, watching the robots and monsters battle in the waters off Alaska. But that isn't enough for Del Toro - as each character is introduced, we learn something about them, their history, even if it is just from a seemingly offhand comment. Because we know more about these characters, they seem more real and we invest more emotion in them, making the outcome of their journey all the more important to us.<br /><br />I have to say that with all of the CGI flooding the multiplex, I was worried that \\"Pacific Rim\\" would be another example of a director who runs rampant with his toy box, using every toy at his disposal whether it makes sense or not. And that is exactly what Del Toro does, but he does it in a way that works brilliantly. The key difference between Del Toro and most other directors is that the CGI is used to tell the story, not to cover up the holes in the narrative. In the \\"Transformers\\" films, the robots crash into buildings and streets and construction, causing destruction but surrounding areas are remarkably intact. In \\"Pacific Rim\\", these robots and aliens are huge, so when they move through specific types of areas, their movements cause destruction, breaking windows and walls simply because the huge creatures are moving through the area. It is a big difference and adds to the realism of the story.<br /><br />The battles between the Kaiju and the Jaegers are impressively staged. The action is pretty thrilling and easy to follow, which isn't often said when watching action staged using CGI. Generally, a `real' element is needed to ground the action - frequently actors on the ground running from the large CGI beasts - and make it seem real. In \\"Pacific Rim\\", the CGI is so good everything already seems real so this extra distraction isn't needed. What is even more impressive is most of the battles take place at night, in the rain, or both, so the palette is darker. These scenes are more interesting and better staged than scenes in the \\"Transformers\\" films, most of which take place in broad daylight. Del Toro isn't afraid to step back and use a wide shot occasionally, allowing us to view the entire scene. Michael Bay keeps his compositions much more confined, which limits them and makes the film feel less grand.<br /><br />The actors are all good and create viable characters - It helps that they all have a history to work with making them more interesting. Hunnam, cast in a role that was reportedly written for him, brings a lot of complexity to the role of Raleigh. Living off the grid for a while, it takes him some time to get back up to speed, to refill his hero batteries. Idris Elba is very good as the leader of this group. When the heads of the nations involved in the program tell him the Jaeger's will soon be replaced by a giant \\"Kaiju-proof\\" wall, you can see the disbelief, pain and disappointment in his eyes. His relationship with Mako also helps to create a lot of empathy for both, making us as invested in his character as we are in Rinku Kinkuchi. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman provide some much needed comic relief. And it wouldn't be a Del Toro film without Ron Pearlman, who plays a black market dealer specializing in Kaiju parts. His role is also funny, adding some much needed laughs.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the last act is pretty predictable. Del Toro places all of the characters in very familiar places and you can easily see what will happen and when. In the hands of a less experienced or less interesting director, this would be a problem. But Del Toro has already created such a unique landscape filled with interesting characters when this happens that it is easier to overlook.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first \\"Transformers\\" film, but \\"Pacific Rim\\" is heads and shoulders above that level. Which shouldn't really be a surprise. Michael Bay is no Guillermo Del Toro.<br /><br />Come on, how could any filmwith giant robots battling giant aliens be bad?

B00A2H9P98|1.0|This summer has had some hits, but it will most likely be remembered for a string of high-profile box office bombs featuring highly-paid stars who usually deliver better films and better box-office. The string of bombs continues with \\"White House Down\\", the latest Roland Emmerich (\\"Independence Day\\", \\"2012\\") film starring Channing Tatum as Capitol policeman John Cale and Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer.<br /><br />Emmerich has created an impressive number of very successful summer popcorn films; he isn't trying to make Oscar winners, he is trying to elevate the B movie to an art form. With each new film, he combines wholly improbably plots with corny acting and over-the-top special effects. And it usually works; just the type of thing to spend a couple of hours escaping the hot summer sun while enjoying big handfuls of popcorn and soda.<br /><br />But \\"White House Down\\" doesn't. And there are a number of reasons why.<br /><br />Some people are pointing to the March release of \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\", a film with a very similar narrative. Every time two different studios decide to release similar films they always end up in a pissing match. Who will be first? Who gets the prime release date? Who has the bigger stars? But ultimately, none of this matters. \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\" doesn't have the star power of the more recent Emmerich film. But \\"Fallen\\" had a lower budget and made money. The last time two studios competed, they jockeyed for position and \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", a terrible film starring Julia Roberts, was released first and flopped badly. A few months later, \\"Snow White and the Huntsmen\\", a marginally better film, made enough money to warrant a sequel. The lesson learned? Star power and release date don't matter. If \\"White House Down\\" were a better film, no one would remember or care about \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\".<br /><br />The key mistake in \\"White House\\" is that everyone takes everything so seriously. It's a preposterous story and there needs to be a certain amount of wink-wink. All of the best examples of this genre (\\"Die Hard\\", \\"Lethal Weapon\\") include humor, one-liners and funny tag lines.<br /><br />Cale is desperate to become a member of the Secret Service and has an interview with Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the newly appointed head of the President's security detail. She is replacing Walker (James Woods) who is retiring. Cale brings his daughter Emily (Joey King) to the White House, because she is a history freak and he needs to earn some Daddy points. The interview doesn't go well and Cale decides to put on a happy face for his daughter who urges him to join a tour of the White House. During this time, a group or mercenaries, led by Stenz (Jason Clarke, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", \\"Lawless\\") infiltrates the White House and begins to fire bullets, taking control. Cale realizes someone needs to protect the President and the two men quickly elude the terrorists. Little Emily, in the bathroom when the attack begins, can't be discounted and will play a role in the drama.<br /><br />During the course of the film, Cale will grow and become a hero. That is pretty much a given and something that should not come as a surprise to anyone. But Tatum who let's face it is pretty but not a good actor, fails to give the character anything very deep. I know we are talking about a summer popcorn film, but when the lead character seems to be following instructions, moving from one point to the other with no obvious thought behind the movements, it is difficult to get behind the hero, to feel anything for him. Tatum always seems robotic during his dramatic moments, delivering his lines in a stiff, stilted manner.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is okay as President Sawyer. He has done better work in the past, but in \\"White House Down\\", he manages to display a little of the charisma and bravado he is known for. These qualities make him believable, as much as any character in a film like this is believable, as the Commander In Chief. He also has one or two funny lines, the only funny lines, which help make the film a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />As the drama continues, various government officials, led by Finnerty and Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) watch from a command center, trying to coordinate the rescue efforts and save the government. Moments on Air Force Two and surveillance video help them watch the drama unfold.<br /><br />But it is up to Cale to save the President, his daughter and the country.<br /><br />I think I was most disappointed by the lack of originality in just about every aspect of the narrative and filmmaking. It is an extremely predictable movie. Early on, you realize everything will be the opposite at the end of the film. When this realization occurs, nothing surprises you. Early on, Cale has an argument with his ex-wife (Rachel LeFevre, TV's \\"Under the Dome\\", \\"Twilight\\") because he missed Emily's school talent show. \\"What did she do?\\" \\"Flag twirling...\\" \\"That's a talent?\\" Every `big moment', a moment meant to deliver a lot of emotional or dramatic impact is telegraphed in a none too subtle fashion. This means that as soon as you hear this exchange about flag twirling, you know it will lead to a scene of the daughter using this very skill for a big dramatic payoff. However, even more shocking is how much of a blatant rip-off this moment is, borrowing everything practically verbatim from Michael Bay's \\"The Rock\\". Because it is such a blatant rip-off, any drama is robbed from the moment and it is ultimately a waste of time.<br /><br />As soon as Cale and President Sawyer get together, they begin to reenact various parts of \\"Die Hard\\". Unfortunately, the villains aren't memorable and draw attention to the actions of the heroes, giving everything a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling. Jason Clarke, who was on the short-lived television series \\"The Chicago Code\\" is working his way up the Hollywood ladder, doing supporting roles in high-profile films. He played virtually the same character in both \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"Lawless\\" - an adult male with no control over his destiny who becomes a victim of others, so his role here is a bit different. But he doesn't stand out for any reason. One of his cohorts, a computer hacker played by Jimmi Simpson (TV's \\"Breakout Kings\\", \\"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter\\") chews up the scenery, but his purpose is never very clear.<br /><br />James Woods plays Walker, the former head of the President's security detail. He has an ax to grind and this propels a lot of the action in the film.<br /><br />Roland Emmerich has created imaginative, albeit over-the-top films, which always serve to entertain the audience. But something went wrong with \\"White House Down\\" it doesn't have the imagination, the power, the outlandish qualities of his other films. It is simply a forgettable film. And that is a disappointment.unny lines, the only funny lines, which help make the film a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />As the drama continues, various government officials, led by Finnerty and Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) watch from a command center, trying to coordinate the rescue efforts and save the government.

Unfortunately, the villains aren't memorable and draw attention to the actions of the heroes, giving everything a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling. Jason Clarke, who was on the short-lived television series \\"The Chicago Code\\" is working his way up the Hollywood ladder, doing supporting roles in high-profile films. He played virtually the same character in both \\"TheGreat Gatsby\\" and \\"Lawless\\" - an adult male with no control over his destiny who becomes a victim of others, so his role here is a bit different. But he doesn't stand out for any reason. One of his cohorts, a computer hacker played by Jimmi Simpson (TV's \\"Breakout Kings\\", \\"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter\\") chews up the scenery, but his purpose is never very clear.<br /><br />James Woods plays Walker, the former head of the President's security detail. He has an ax to grind and this propels a lot of the action in the film.<br /><br />Roland Emmerich has created imaginative, albeit over-the-top films, which always serve to entertain the audience. But something went wrong with \\"White House Down\\" it doesn't have the imagination, the power, the outlandish qualities of his other films. It is simply a forgettable film. And that is a disappointment.

0920668372|5.0|I found this book at the Goodwill and found it so touching, as did my 3.5-year-old. It made me cry a bit, but my son loves when I rock him and sing the song to him.  In fact, he asks to hear this story at least once a day and loves that the man rocks him Mommy, too.  Excellent story and fabulous memory for me and my boy.
B00D37UP4S|2.0|This movie was... I don't know... boring? I seriously have a really hard time forming an opinion on it beyond just being REALLY not into it the whole time.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|My wife and I could not get over the drastic shift from epic saga/journey of classic Tolkien to 'cartooney' and bumbling theme of this movie. It felt like disney produced this from the snot jokes to the over the top acting. I'll not watch the next one but wait for it on Netflix.
B00571F26Y|3.0|This diet is to restrictive, unless you want to be a vegetarian.  I tried eliminating all wheat and my stomach did feel better, with no heart burn.  After a few days I did eat some wheat but not bread and only a little.  Heart burn returned.  Only ate a few slices of pizza one day, with no problems.  It is really a lot like the 2 day diet, which limits your carbs.  The power protein  diet that i used for a year worked the best. I just needed to eat more carbs than I did, because of my age.  I totally believe this book about the change in wheat.  I noticed it immediately in the 50's and hated white bread since.  I think it's time farmers thought about the food their growing and grow healthy wheat.  It's not always about the money!  Charge more if you have to but stop growing this crap wheat that is hurting our bodies!
1490313370|5.0|James Altucher's book CHOOSE YOURSELF is a must read. His writing style is accessible, engaging and witty. His advice is spot on. I am not a finance or start-up type of person, but this book still spoke to me. I think his daily practice and other practical tips are invaluable in these times, when everything is shifting and like many, sometimes we do not know what to do or where to turn. Rather than just wishing ourselves to disappear (like I, and many others probably have), James is our light at the end of the tunnel, offering simple and easy steps/tools to not just get us out of the funk, but help us live a life worth living. This book helped me reframe my world and redefine my own sense of self.. how many books can do that?  The author is a bright force of positivity in this world. I am sad that I am done with this book.. i miss my daily dose of Altucher!!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This version wasn't in 3-D, and I have to say it was a lot less enjoyable. I did like how someone pointed out this was just an Army of Darkness remake, which it totally was. Pay close attention to the screen as it extends from Kansas to Oz. It was really cool, yet simple effect.

B00C7DGRL4|1.0|This movie had all the writing power of a seventh-grade Creative Expressions course. A lot of movies wouldn't be as good if you took away certain elements to make it more family-friendly. I could think of 15 minutes here that you could take away and make it both a better and family-friendly flick. All the same, the writing, acting and special effects were all ridiculously bad.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie again! Once who really watch it a couple of times you begin to understand the movie from the writer's point of view. The movie mirrors the behavior and mentally of that time in history.
B003VANOFY|4.0|pros:<br />-mic sound quality is great. Everyone on skype hears me loud and clear<br />-I'm not really an audiophile, but the sound is good (sometimes i think the speaker is on when i have the 7.1 surround on)<br />-love the G macro keys ... I just have them to default though (play/pause, skip, previous)<br />-love the scroll volume wheel instead of the buttoned ones<br />-no problem with their software/drivers<br />-range of the wireless is really long i can use this headset even when im downstairs<br />-built sturdy (i've accidentally sat on it and hit my head sideways with it on while walking upstairs)<br />-battery life is at least 8-10 hours without mic<br /><br />cons:<br />-uncomfortable over long periods of time or if you wear glasses like me<br />-the power button annoys me especially when you power off (I think you only have to press for like 2 seconds, but I can never tell when to let go because it doesn't actually turn off until you let go of the power button)<br />-the pads / foams are not removable so it's going to be hard to clean up<br />-the mute button is pretty useless when you can just put your mic up<br /><br />overall if you want a wireless headset this is a very good choice. The cons don't really bother me, but I would definitely give it 5/5 stars if it was a little more comfortable since i sit in front of computer for a long time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Thoughtful family story, well written, absorbing and sensual.  The characters come alive in a very real way with the author,s great language skills.
B00DM0UTPQ|4.0|You can never go wrong with a meaty \\"Submarine Movie\\"--especially one that has old standby Ed Harris at the helm.  In, \\"Phantom,\\" we get to revisit the tight quarters, the claustrophobic tension, the barked nautical commands and the unbearably tense, \\"Time is running out\\" scenario.  All of this is overlaid onto the last days of Russian Communism and the Cold War atmosphere of 1968.  While some of the dialogue is  a bit too \\"Hammy\\" and some of the characters a bit too clichéd, the overall viewing experience will be rewarding to one looking for intelligent escapist action.  My only complaint would be that most of the underwater scenes (filmed outside of the submarine) are really too dark to decipher--even on an HDTV screen.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|game is fun when it works. Sometimes it would just stop working and I'd have to force shutdown. Then it automatically updated a few days ago (thought I had that feature blocked, but I digress) and now it won't load. As others said, it gets stuck on the percent loading screen but never actually loads. I've tried un/reinstalling but nothing works. Very annoying.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This whole story could have been written in  30 pages, certainly expected better from Ms Rowling. What a depressing cast of characters.
B001GXYBY6|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie.  I am a fan of the series, and what I loved about this movie was that it was like watching a semi-live action version of an episode.  There were a lot of nods to the series, and it was very obvious that EVERYONE working on this project respected the series.  All too often, movies are made from series and they are 'spoofs' (like Will Ferrell's &#34;Bewitched&#34;) where you can tell that it was just to take advantage of the name recognition, but the production did not respect or get the show itself.<br /><br />These guys got it.  Casting was spot on.  There were several nods to the series .... from costuming, to scenes that almost came out of episodes... even having Peter Fernandez be a part of it.<br /><br />There is a lot going on visually, some very stunning effects.  A bit too much of Spritle and Chim Chim (but I also felt that about the series itself.  I'm just not a fan of those characters).<br /><br />We love this movie so much that when we lost our copy in a recent move, we had to REPLACE it.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|*Thoughts on Blu-Ray at the bottom*<br /><br />Oblivion is a fun, if not particularly great sci-fi action film starring Tom Cruise from writer/director Joseph Kosinski.  A wonderful treat for the eyes, Oblivion manages to create a fun, visual spectacular sci-fi action flick, even if its story leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The opening narration of the film establishes that Earth has been attacked by an alien force.  Most of the population has evacuated Earth to create a colony on Titan.  Earth meanwhile is being terra formed to make conditions suitable for human life.  The orbital space station \\"Tet\\" oversees this process.  On the surface a cleanup crew of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) handle drone repair and fend off the alien Scavengers (\\"Scavs\\" for short) who threaten the drones and power stations on the planet's surface.  They receive orders from Sally (Melissa Leo) aboard Tet, and is their sole human contact.<br /><br />Jack is curious of his surroundings, and in his final two weeks of duty a series of events take place that cause him to question his mission.  After capsules containing human bodies fall from the sky and are destroyed by the drones he's been watching over he is thrust into a life or death struggle to discover to real fate of the planet, and its human population.<br /><br />Oblivion reminded me an awful lot of the kind sci-fi movies made during the 1970s.  The movie has numerous twists and I'd say at a certain point you're either going to throw your hands up in frustration or simply accept that this is the kind of movie you're watching.  Oblivion feels right at home next to movies such as The Omega Man, Soylent Green, and Logan's Run, and if you go in expecting that kind of story you shouldn't be too disappointed.<br /><br />Tom Cruise isn't breaking any new ground with his performance in Oblivion.  He's as good as he's ever been in the hero's role, but still, given the nature of the script there were a lot of directions they could have gone with this character.  Cruise gives the best performance in the film, but that isn't saying too much.  If they'd added some more internal conflict to the Jack Harper character I'm sure Cruise could have pulled it off and the movie would have been better for it.  As it is, this is you're pretty typical protagonist role for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />It is the visuals and action sequences of Oblivion that really sell the picture.  As with his previous outing in TRON: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski proves he has an eye for striking sci-fi visuals and spectacular action.  When the story isn't breaking any new ground the visuals will keep you interested, if nothing else.  It just works.  Oblivion has some outstanding aerial battles involving Jack's \\"Bubble Ship\\" which really is a blast to watch.  From a design standpoint I  think the bubble ship Jack flies around is one of the coolest I've seen on film, looking like a cross between a helicopter and a dragonfly.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bubble ship winds up being the thing people remember most about this movie.<br /><br /> As it is Oblivion, is an enjoyable sci-fi action movie.  If you're at all a fan of those old sci-fi movies where plot twists lie around every corner, exciting action sequences, and exciting sci-fi visuals odds are you'll enjoy Oblivion.<br /><br />Blu-Ray:<br />The Blu-Ray release of Oblivion has great picture and sound.  Special features include a decent look into the making of the film.  What I valued most about the special features was the knowledge that many of Oblivion's effects were done in-camera.  In an age where CGI dominates almost every aspect of film this is refreshing, and further aids Kosinski in making Oblivion a tribute to 70s sci-fi.Also included are deleted scenes and a feature commentary by director Kosinski and Cruise, and an isolated soundtrack score.<br /><br />Oblivion release will make great use of your Blu-Ray player, HDTV, and sound system.I wish there'd been more material discussing the world of Oblivion, but it is a satisfying purchase. So, I'm going to give a thumbs up to Oblivion on Blu-Ray.I wish there'd been more material discussing the world of Oblivion, but it is a satisfying purchase.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's too bad that a series so great was cancelled after just one season. One of the most entertaining and well written shows ever. I'm surprised that it took so long to get Serenity made afterwards, although, it shouldn't surprise me coming from the network that cancelled the show to begin with.
B00CFA227C|3.0|We sure have been getting a lot of reinterpretations of classic fantasy tales lately, haven't we?  Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie that strives to follow in the footsteps of The Princess Bride but falters.  It's not that it necessarily is a bad movie, it just doesn't fully realize its goals.  That's the main thing I walked away with after seeing Jack the Giant Slayer.<br /><br />The story, naturally, is an action centric retelling of the classic Jack and the Beanstalk.  Naturally the story centers on Jack (Nicholas Hoult) a farm boy who comes by some magic beans.  One rainy evening the princess of the kingdom runs away from home and winds up in Jack's house to escape the rain.  Before the two can get to better know one another the rain activates the beans which take the princess away to the land of giants far above the clouds.  Determined to save the princess Jack joins the knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and his men to climb the beanstalk and rescue the princess.<br /><br />If you couldn't tell already this is a silly movie.  The plot is silly, the characters are over the top, and the special effects are cartoony.  That's clearly what the movie is going for, but if reading that immediately turns you off from it than I doubt you'll have much fun with Jack the Giant Slayer.<br /><br />Bryan Singer is a talented director, but the film just doesn't have enough substance to hit home.  There is humor, and occasionally some good bits of action, but the plot is predictable, and there isn't enough material for the cast to work with.  There are moments that work where you as a viewer really can see what the filmmakers were going for, but these moments are too few.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is the shining light of the film.  As the knight Elmont, McGregor completely steals the show.  Watching McGregor's performance you can see what the movie was striving for, and if script and everyone else in the cast could match him the film would have been a lot better.  It's the kind of \\"I've seen everything and never panic no matter the situation\\" type character and its clear McGregor has a blast from start to finish.  He's having fun, and I as a viewer was having fun with him.  So if you're at all a fan of Ewan McGregor Jack the Giant Slayer is worth a watch.<br /><br />Jack the Giant Slayer doesn't come anywhere close to reaching the lofty standards of The Princess Bride, but I didn't regret watching it.  There's some decent action here, some good visuals there, and Ewan McGregor's performance is fun.  If you're into light fantasy adventures or have kids around the age of 10 or so the movie is fun, but know that there are better options out there.ve seen everything and never panic no matter the situation\\" type character and its clear McGregor has a blast from start to finish.

B007MDB71O|4.0|John Carter. Did it deserve the fate it received at the box office?  I'm not entirely sure what the answer to that is, but I do know, for what it's worth, the movie is an enjoyable adventure flick deeply rooted in its pulp fiction source.<br /><br />A story of an ex-Confederate soldier who finds himself in the middle of a planet wide conflict on the surface of Mars is pure pulp fiction and in that respect I ate up every minute of John Carter.  I've always enjoyed these kind of stories and John Carter is elbows deep in its background as a pulp serial.  This is swashbuckling action with a sci-fi background, and if that's what you came to see you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The special effects of John Carter are solid, although they do leave something to be desired knowing the film's immense $250 million production budget.  Don't get me wrong, many of the visuals are stunning, but there is nothing that immediately comes to mind when I think about John Carter.  Sure, watching the film scene by scene I can say \\"That looks good\\" but never was there anything that just made me say \\"Wow!\\"  If I remember anything it's the design of the four-armed Tharks.<br /><br />Special effects don't make a movie, but the characters of John Carter leave a lot to be desired.  Taylor Kitsch lacks the necessary charisma to pull off his role and his chemistry with Dejah Thoris is non-existent.  Carter's alien allies Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and his daughter Sola (Samantha Morton) are probably my favorite characters in the film and it likely has more to do with their design than their writing.<br /><br />For the record: I have never read any of Edgar Wright Burroughs Barsoom novels.  I cannot say how this movie compares to A Princess of Mars or any other entry in the series.  As such I am not reviewing this movie as a fan.  It is my understanding that the movie has been divisive amongst the book series' fans mostly due to the fact that it compresses too much of A Princess of Mars's  plot into a relatively short running time.  That's just what I've heard.<br /><br />That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if this claim was accurate.  John Carter feels like a film that been cut down from a far longer running time and I am curious to know if a longer cut exists.  If Disney is ever willing to release an extended cut I am certainly willing to give it a watch.<br /><br />At the end of the day I'll say that Disney was in over their heads investing so heavily in this film.  I see no problem in adapting a source as old as John Carter, but it needed more memorable visuals, a charismatic lead, and some truly spectacular action sequences...but even then I don't think Disney should have sunk themselves so deep with this film's budget.<br /><br />John Carter is by no means a spectacular adventure movie, and Disney was in over their heads with the budget, but it is enjoyable for what it is.  There are some fun visuals, and some impressive effect sequences here and there.  As unlikely as it is I would enjoy seeing a sequel to John Carter.  So if you're looking for a fun movie to rent.  On Blu-Ray John Carter looks and sounds great.  If you want to test out your hi-def television or are interested in enjoying a pulp adventure I'd say John Carter is a winner.plot into a relatively short running time.

0545265355|5.0|I liked this box set - all the boxes were hardcover and they came in a sturdy holder for easy storage. I enjoyed the books - they were realistic in terms of showing how a government could manipulate or intimidate large numbers of persons. I thought the characters were well drawn and although the 1st and 2nd books were stronger the last book does have the biggest challenge which is why I think many persons had problems with it. The last book had to show what happens when the warriors stop fighting and how people have to deal with whole scale loss and extreme violence that they had to do to others and which was done to them. I think that the main character, while strong, was showing that there is a price to be paid for being the face of a revolution and also for seeing massive loss of life in such a short space of time. The writing style was very good and the various levels of intrigue kept the plot from being predicable.

B004F27I3Q|5.0|I was first turned on to this band from their current album, &#34;The Mouths of Madness&#34;.  Reviews compared that great sound to this album so I had to track it down until I finally found one in Belgium of all places.  I'm so glad I did.  If you like the sound of early Black Sabbath, you will like this band.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read the trilogy, and the first was extremely captivating, so naturally a reader feeling that way wants to know how the lives of the characters turns out. I wasn't disappointed. This series has been made a mockery of because of the sex scenes, and of course, they're there. But the writing is top notch, Ms. James is clearly very talented. Her characters, flawed as they may be, are thoroughly developed. I enjoyed this book, I enjoyed the trilogy. If you liked the first book, go ahead and follow through with 2 and 3; the unlikely couple has a happy ending in life and it's enjoyable to read how they get there. (I gave the book 4 stars simply because while I understand the sex scenes are a part of who Christian is, they can be distracting from the story at times.)
B0036S4B6M|5.0|After watching the first season I was curious to see what Pipers real experience had been. I found that she was homestead contrite when detailing her mental and emotional journey through prison,  and extremely human in her connections to her fellow inmates. I felt like despite these people's need to be punished for whatever wrongs they did, they remain human and have a great deal of humiliation and dehumanization to war against they serve their time. Excellent read.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|One of the things that is so good about Castle is the fact that is doesn't push the hard edge of crime in your face.  So many of the police shows are so gritty that there is no enjoyment.  The character development is wonderful as well.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|And The Mountains Echoed was enjoyable, but it did not &#34;grip&#34; me, as did The Kite Runner, which I loved.

B002DQLGHU|4.0|This movie was really good. It is different than the book. Personally I like the book better, but the movie was almost as good. The only thing I am going to say about the movie is that it has a really strange ending. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fanacy books and movies
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like seeing the percentage of battery remaining next to the battery icon. It makes it so much easier to know accurately when I need to recharge. I have not had any problems with heat build-up, or shorter battery life. The graphics are kind of cool,too.

B00CW665VI|3.0|This was a unique story with an interesting-ish plot, however I was not a fan of the first person POV.<br /><br />The main character TALK's to the reader, and asks questions, rather than just telling his story. I personally found it very distracting and annoying.<br /><br />two small examples<br />&#34;where was I, are you still with me&#34;?<br />You can see how pale she is, right?<br />&#34;I know what you are thinking&#34;......really how so, lol.<br /><br />If you don't mind this type of narration you might enjoy the story, it just wasn't for me :)
B007HACDLK|3.0|Too many authors follow the Louis L'Amour formula in writing novels:  They give the hero of the story so many and such extraordinary characteristics that he becomes unrealistic and unbelievable, even if the story itself is well crafted as this one was.
B000V6U846|5.0|In my opinion the best live album i've heard. and what else can you say it's BOB! that alone warrants a listen.

B009PJXY3M|4.0|When I first heard that Bridgit Mendler had released a CD, I wasn't surprised. Almost all of the famous girl actors from Disney end up with a career in music - whether they're talented enough for it or not. I dismissed the album until Disney started playing the acoustic performances of her songs. Bridgit's acoustic performances are beautiful and kept getting stuck in my head, so I decided to give the album a chance.<br /><br />Hello My Name Is... is actually a pretty good album. The songs have positive messages and are fairly original. When I'm listening to them, I don't feel like I've heard the lyrics a million times before. I was pleased to learn that Bridgit co-wrote every song on the album. Not all \\"Disney artists\\" write the songs on their first CD. I bought the deluxe version of the album, and I think it was worth the extra money I spent. We're Dancing isn't my favorite song, but I enjoy Postcard and Quicksand.<br /><br />The only thing about the CD that disappoints me is that the songs feel too electronically polished. What I love about Bridgit is her voice - it's unique and beautiful. But most of the songs on the album have electronic elements added to them that almost hide her voice. Had I listened to the CD without hearing her acoustic performances, I would have assumed those elements were added because she can't sing well. Now that I know she can sing well, I wish they had left her voice as the focus of the songs and been more sparing with the electronic add-ons.<br /><br />Maybe Bridgit will release a CD of the acoustic versions of her songs. I'd give it a 5.
140006922X|4.0|Many may ask, as did FOX News' Lauren Green when \\"interviewing\\" the author of ZEALOT, why a Muslim would write a book about the founder of Christianity?  Why not then ask a Jew why he wrote an immortal folk opera about African-Americans?  Or why a female would write an undying classic about a male mad scientist and his male monster creation?  The questions are, of course, ridiculous.  We are ALL humans first - and being human, nothing human should be alien to us.  Or off limits due to other limited minds.<br /><br />ZEALOT is a riveting read from start to finish.  Reza Aslan uses words like Rembrandt used paints in depicting the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth: both men create compelling portraits of a complex and controversial historical conundrum.  And that is precisely what both the historical Jesus - the Zealot of Mr. Aslan's nuts-and-bolts research - and the conceptual Christ - the Risen One of Pauline theology - are.  Conundrums, both, especially at the point where they both connect.  So the two are actually one in the end - for despite the commonsense, bare fact essentials of any attempt to recreate the life and death of the historical Jesus, the mystery of what truly happened after that time spent in the grave will always remain.  Even Mr. Aslan cannot explain the fervor of the disciples who \\"were beaten, whipped, stoned, and crucified, yet they would not cease proclaiming the risen Jesus.\\"  And unless one accepts the still unexplained Shroud of Turin as tangible evidence, Mr. Aslan's contention is that \\"the resurrection is not a historical event.\\"  He continues: \\"It may have had historical ripples, but the event itself falls outside the scope of history and into the realm of faith.\\"  It \\"may\\" have had historical ripples?  Quite an understatement, that!  Yet why doesn't it fall within the scope of history?  Primarily because it is a miracle and something that never quite happened before.  It is something that our materialistic minds cannot wrap around and comprehend.  We are all Doubting Thomases at some time or another.  And actually the majority of the miracles attributed to Jesus during his ministry are not deeply addressed within this book. And how could they be?  They cannot be explained easily whatsoever.  They are either made-up or myth or wild exaggerations. Or they happened. But if it was all rubbish...why did the 'cult of Christ' take root and flourish so?  Mr. Aslan attempts to answer these persistent questions and succeeds on his own terms admirably.  But the enigma remains.<br /><br />One example here that might show somewhat that no matter how admirable Mr. Aslan's recreation and interpretation of the life and times of Jesus is, there is the shaky ground that still exists and that can rattle the soul and mind into realizing that there is no way of absolutely knowing everything about anything, let alone something that happened two thousand years ago.  On page 148: In arguing about Jesus having a meeting with Pontius Pilate shortly after his arrest, Mr. Aslan writes: \\"The notion that (Pilate) would even be in the same room as Jesus...beggars the imagination.\\"  \\"There is reason to suspect that\\" the meeting is \\"a fabrication.\\"  On page 152 it is written: \\"It is, of course, not inconceivable that Jesus would have received a brief audience with the Roman governor...\\"  So which is it?  \\"Not inconceivable\\" or \\"a fabrication.\\"  Perhaps Pilate himself allegedly had the best answer for this and perhaps everything under the sun and moon:  What is Truth?<br /><br />One other point.  The cropped cover illustration, a painting presumably of Jesus, bears an incredible resemblance to the author's photo on the back flap of the dust jacket.  Note the exact same tilt of the head, the similarity of the eyes, nose and lips and the faint facial hairs on Mr. Aslan's face that subliminally suggest the facial hair in the painted face on the cover.  Curious coincidence, if that.<br /><br />In closing, the book is a compelling,captivating read. Eyes may be opened.  Minds engaged. One can learn very vital much of the history of that time and place.  But, alas, history is but one side of the coin.  The other is...mystery. And that will always remain.captivating read. Eyes may be opened.  Minds engaged. One can learn very vital much of the history of that time and place.  But, alas, history is but one side of the coin.  The other is...mystery. And that will always remain.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This was a very good movie.  Had to watch it at least 3 times to make sure I go the what was really happening.  Again a good horror movie that does not contain a bunch of rude language or sexual content.
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|New perspective and filled with scientific data. Starting up something. What the prisoners dilema did fot decision theory Grant is doing for knowledge workers.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was awesome!!! Sometimes you just can't put the game down!!! Some of the settings are also awesome!!! Get this game!!!!
B009K0OL06|5.0|I typically stick to Comedy Central, Workaholics, Tosh, HBO, and Showtime. This is a soapy-ish type show I typically would not watch. But, for some reason, I buy whatever this show is selling. The story lines get wonky and cliché but I can't put my finger on why it works so well. Guilty pleasure? Who knows. All I know is, embrace the ridiculous, because they do it right.
1401938906|5.0|Excellent book! I loved it... feed your brain! Learn the law of attraction in the correct manner that one should... then practice it everyday!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Taking great advantage of the touch screen, The Room is a piece tutorial and puzzling delight.  I look forward to the developer's next effort.
B005LAII44|3.0|Okay, I'm going to start with a SPOILER ALERT....<br />so, if you have not seen it yet, then click away from here.....<br /><br />okay......the movie was okay, but it had quite a few holes in it. For starters, how in the heck did storm shadow survive after falling into the arctic waters after his fight with snake eyes? I saw him fall into the water when the cobra subs were starting to bug out. Maybe I messed it in this movie, but I believe I didn't. I only see him at this \\"underground base\\" wearing snake eyes costume. On that note #2......Cobra Commander and destro were locked away in a maximum security prison under the watchful eyes of the joes...only to reappear in a European prison under the command of some idiot? This made absolutely no sense to me.....<br /><br />#3......The Joes were supposedly taken out during an attack. Where in the heck were the Joes from the first film? Where was Scarlet? Heck, where was Dukes partner in this movie? Where was the high-tech Cobra jet at? Where was Dukes girlfriend at after the first movie? Where was the general from the first one? (Dennis Quaid) UGGGHHH!! By doing this, the directors cut away several storylines that were developing. heck, I would have liked another Cobra Base to be in this movie!!<br /><br />#4......The President being guarded by cobra units yet I didn't see any mind control going on.<br />#5......Cobra commander. I liked how he had his original GI Joe style helmet but still didn't seem to make a big impact.<br />#6......Destro gets left behind...why?<br />#7......Storm Shadow's master was killed by Zartan? WHAT?????<br />#8......Duke getting killed off early.....I guess we will never find out about the \\"baroness\\" fate<br /><br />Well, it seems to me that the Rock and Bruce Willis want to get a paycheck....because Willis doesn't seem to gel into this type of movie. It's a little different then Die Hard movies.<br /><br />The movie goes on its typical role....the good guys track down the bad guys, the good guys find the true identity of the president, and then go for the rescue to save the world....<br /><br />One thing that pisses me off in these type of movies is how fast the bad guys get taken out, like the bad guys have no training whatsoever. These 5 just mop the floor with them too easily....and the enemy always seem to fall into their hands right at the most opportune times. And of course, the one second left abort has been played over several times before.<br /><br />Overall, Duke and the Rock had some laughs, Snake eyes..well, still didn't say a word.....and the Joes kicked some Cobra butt.<br /><br />But, what i would have liked to see was more of a story in this one, like we saw in the first film. Stories didn't develop, and it was mostly action scenes. I was disappointed that it wasn't more of what it should have been....I was disappointed with all my anticipation after the first film.<br /><br />The rock cannot save this...but he can help me give it 3 stars...

B000SEI230|5.0|I love all of his books.  I'm tired of all of the violence that is in so many of today's books.  Nicholas Sparks' books are not violent.

B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I have been a diehard Hanson fan since the beginning, and their music just keeps getting better and better. Their musical style has really evolved over time and I love listening to every song on this album. As you would expect from them, there is a great mixture of up tempo songs and ballads, with each brother having their share of lead vocals. I also love the big band sound that is so prevelant in this album. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!

Great app!
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I did not get feeling she was in love. .. She has no idea who this man is, if he has a job, career, plan, unemployment...wife , family nothing. But he comes from Lord only knows what country after five months of no contact..at all , he shows up basically says I am staying in with you and this is ok? Not so much. Writing not bad , premise not good. Just not at all believable . She seems together initially  then does ridiculous things. . He is not a  character i want to read more about. He had absolutely no purpose in the book-- at all. No interest in reading anything else from this author even if if is free.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining. I did not see the movie. May it's time to do it now. I wish I could make graphics like that,
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The packaging is pretty good.  Discs weren't moving around inside or anything cheap like that.<br /><br />There is an outer box and inside are two folded binders.  The bigger one has the Blue Ray and the smaller one has the regular DVD version.  The imagery print on the inside is nice too.  There is a print of some of the main characters on the binders.<br /><br />The DVD navigation menus were simple and worked.  (I used VLC Player on my computer to play these.)<br /><br />I discovered on the blue ray there is extra content but I can't watch since I don't have a blue ray player yet.<br /><br />As far as the whole series goes, I watched one and found I wanted to watch more.  So I watched the entire 12 or so hours worth of episodes in one sitting.  Very beautiful landscapes and costumes, fully developed characters, and very interesting story line.  I found it easy to identify with at least one character which sucks you in some more.  The music matches the overall story telling and mood.  Transitions between scenes in my opinion are creatively done.  It even adds some humor into it.  The setting is in a fictional land.  There is magic, dragons, and prophecy in the story.  There is nudity but not excessive and where appropriate in the story telling.  It would seem the movie is about a fight between good and evil.  So as you watch you will try to figure out each character as far as who is good and who is evil, who is trustworthy who is not, etc but you find it is not so clear cut and events change people.<br /><br />Overall the story moves along.  Each episode is a clear advancement from the previous.  You will feel something is building up and something big will happen as the story continues to unfold.

This book had me from the first page.  Just when I thought I had it figured out, BAM!  I did not have it figured out.  I love books that play with your mind, and this one is a masterful example of that.  Highly recommended!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Only part I don't like is tha I have to wait for the next book, but I'm sure it will be worth it.
B007SKGZN6|4.0|I've seen If I Stay on many people's top lists for various Top 10 Tuesday topics so I knew that I wanted to read it. However, I was browsing my local library's ebook catalog and came across book 2, Where She Went and decided to search to see if they had book 1. Well they did. But in audiobook version. I like audiobooks because I can listen when doing other things. Specifically while I work. However, I find that the story doesn't sink in as much as if I had read it myself. I also find that the narrator doesn't always add emphasis where I would read it--or sarcasm or any other emotion. But I didn't find the narrator of this book, Kirsten Potter, lacking at all. She does a great job infusing emotion into this narration. I almost felt like she might have enhanced the story for me.<br /><br />I knew that this book was about a girl whose life changes due to a car accident from reading the description above, but I didn't realize what all that would involve. If I Stay is a story about a girl who's having an out of body experience trying to decide if she should stay and live or let go. She watches the events after the accident from the outside of her body. These events mixed with flashbacks from her past help her to make this ultimate of all decisions.<br /><br />If I Stay is a different kind of book that brought out some deep emotions from within me. I didn't cry throughout the whole thing, but I definitely teared up, and I got chills a couple of times. If I Stay will make you stop to think about what's important in your own life and what you can no longer afford to take for granted. And I love books like that...books that make an impact on how I live my life. I don't want to go into more detail because this book needs to be experienced.<br /><br />If I Stay lived up to the hype it's received. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to start Where She Went--will be borrowing that from the library ASAP. If I Stay gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read If I Stay? What did you think?

B004LPLU4K|5.0|This was a great family movie, very well done, and followed the book, which all my grandchildren had read.  I would recommend this movie, just to see the garden if nothing else.  The little girl was terrific.

B00CLD65X0|4.0|I won't reveal the reason for my disappointment.  This season was very good but I think it lacked the level of character development we have seen in the earlier seasons.
0375842209|5.0|Never have I read something written in the viewpoint of death.  It is or should be a &#34;must read.&#34;  Has everything, history, humanity, life, death and everything in between!  Fabulous!

B0041KVW2K|5.0|The Beatles box set is amazing!!!!!  It sounds great and looks good too!!!  So very happy we made this purchase!!!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great Pirate Book.  One of the best know pirates is introduced.  Long John Silver.  He's bad but you are kind of rooting for him to find the treasure.  Some of the lanugage was hard to read but overall a great summer book and I would highly recommend reading it.
006226303X|5.0|Wonderful book, highly recommend!  Listened to while traveling, Gaiman's voice is perfect and sets the stage all the way through.  Even listened to credits just to hear more!  Did not want the book to end.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I purchased this to use with my I-Pad and it certainly meets my expectations.  I love that my touch screen is no longer full of fingerprints,  The different sized tips are very useful for accuracy.  Overall I a very happy with my purchase.
B00AEBBAF4|4.0|Excellent  movie...I  recommend  it.  Jack  Black  and  the  whole  crew  just  make  it  so  enjoyable  to  watch.  A  must  have  in  your  movie  collection.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun! Good graphics. If you have something to do, do not start playing. This game is extremely addictive.  A lot of fun.
0140386335|5.0|I am still reading it, but since I saw the movie as a kid wanted to check out the book and wow is it so much better. The fantasy and level of detail is superb and dark enough in tone to keep adults reading and not scare the kiddies. Looking forward to the ending, well not really it is so good I don't want it to end.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This  movie epitomizes  what  a  western  should  be  like.  It's  captivating  from  beginning  to  end.  It's  no  wonder  it  won  two  acadamy  awards...best  screen  play  and  best  supporting  actor.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Great story.  Love this author.  Have never read a bad book by her.  Like her characters and sotry lines.  Would highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was totally loving and having fun playing this game. But after the recent update it keeps freezing on the loading page. Please fix it! This game is great for all ages and every Despicable Me fan should have it.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book is excellent, well written and generally an amazing read.  That said, the subject matter may not be for everyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Although I had issues with my first Kindle Fire HD 8.9, it was replaced and now it works fine and the USB and Accelerated Charger work great.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I've uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times on my Kindle Fire and after the initial cut scene, the game sticks on the loading screen and never actually plays. Disappointed, my daughter really wanted to try this.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fascinating game for all ages. Very creative and challenging at multiple levels. The artwork and sound is amusing as well
B000TNF7NS|5.0|Who knew at the time that UFO would be recognized as one of the premier 70's hard rock bands of all time. For years they flew under the radar. Their music is awesome by any standards. But it seems they are more appreciated now than back then. This is my favorite. It is no nonsense, in your face hard rock. If that's what you like then you will like this album.
0307730697|5.0|This book is excellent. What else is there to say? God has a plan for his people and Adam Brown was one of His instruments.<br />I hope, and I am sure the Brown family would agree, that through this book, Adam continues to save people.<br />Long live the Brotherhood<br />Job 19:26
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I noticed this movie received some poor reviews, but after renting the 2d version from Redbox I had to see it in 3D and it was awesome.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan's \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" traces four meals from their origins to the table.  In doing so, he brings to light the decisions we face each time we make a decision about our food.  Cheap chicken breasts from the local supermarket?  A trip to Whole Foods for free-range chickens?  Or a purchase from the farmers' market to support a local farmer?<br /><br />What makes \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" come alive is Pollan's masterful voice.  He incorporates scientific findings with a personal narrative, offering a compelling journey through America's food system.  Much of the information I already knew, having grown up in a rural agricultural area -- corn is massively subsidized, beef cattle are sent to feedlots to stuff themselves on cheap corn, our whole conventional agricultural system rests on a sea of fossil fuels from the Middle East.<br /><br />What Pollan does so well is to weave these disparate elements to create a cohesive narrative.  He explored Big Organic (hint: the stuff you buy at Whole Foods is often shockingly similar to what's found at the local supermarket) and a small, independent farmer practicing more sustainable agricultural management.<br /><br />I found the foraging piece of the book, in which Pollan hunts wild pig and gathers mushrooms, to be less compelling than the rest.  Perhaps because I grew up in an area where such things were the norm, this \\"city slicker wrestles with guilt about killing an animal, finds out that he likes it, and succumbs to feelings of shame\\" bit didn't resonate with me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a smart book that illustrates everything that is wrong (and a few things that are right) about American food practices.  I highly recommend it to anyone wondering where their food truly comes from.
B0030DIP7O|4.0|If you like the Scorpions, and who doesn't ?... then you will like these discs. This is a great buy on some vintage hard rock. If you love the Scorpions and you dig deep cuts from classic rock then you will love this set of albums. There were some songs I hadn't heard before from Uli that aren't on the compilations I had. Those songs are worth the price by themselves.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Interesting show - kept me interested till the end of the season.  Looking forward to season two and more and?
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Now I can use the Kindle quick charger.  The connection cord should be a part of the charger order, not separate!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was very captivating and magnificent. The old photographs enhance the feeling in the book. The reader can get drawn into this book and enjoy every minute of this adventure story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Interesting game. My kids like to care for their horse. With severe allergies in the house, this realistic horse simulator is the closest they get to a pet.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|Good show watched it with my daughter Katy is a lil weird but down to earth kind of girl. Great to see with the kids.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you like this type of movie, you will love the way this is made.  The special effects are huge and impressive.  There is even a plot to follow.  A fun way to spend an evening.
B005HG4C4C|2.0|Dear Dream Theater,<br />You're amazing. You got me into prog when I first heard \\"Octavarium.\\" But you're not you anymore. I mean, I've noticed you slipping into the habit of recycling ideas a little bit on the last two albums, but this is just too far. Where is the majesty of Images and Words? Where are the balls of Awake? Where is the intelligence of Metropolis? Where is the ambition of Six Degrees? This album has no ambition other than to continue based on a formula. The only \\"Oh shoot\\" moment is the throat singing, until it delves into an extremely typical prog metal song. And typical is a word I never wanted to have to use on Dream Theater.<br />I mean, I can't really say that the album is \\"bad,\\" but it's not genre-defining material in any sense. I'm sure there are some out there who are perfectly happy with this album. I really just expect more from you, I'm sorry.<br />Please, let the next album do something so different and cool that I fall in love all over again. But right now, I'm gonna have to see other bands too.<br />Sincerely,<br />Heartbroken Fan
B00701L5XS|5.0|I love how you can watch the knot as it is being tied and how you can pause it to go at your own pace.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I picked it up for a couple of reasons : Fey makes me laugh and it was on sale.  I annoyed my wife while reading it by laughing out loud every 20 minutes.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great read! If your looking for an intense page turner look no further than \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\"!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|When I first heard &#34;Sail,&#34; I thought AWOLNATION was another dumb, angry, modern band. After listening to the other songs, I have discovered that they are actually quite a clever, angry, modern band. Songs such as the oft-played &#34;Not Your Fault&#34; and &#34;Kill Your Heroes&#34; provide a good introduction to their sound, but it goes beyond that. &#34;Soul Wars,&#34; the first real track on the album, is my second favorite. High energy, high fun. &#34;People&#34; and &#34;All I Need&#34; are the main hiccups in my mind, the rest is good fun. Then we come to the crown jewel, &#34;Knights of Shame.&#34; Some may disagree, but this is one of the most brilliant songs I have ever heard. Even though I'm used to long prog songs, it's hard not to get caught in the catchiness of this song. Each section flows well into the next, lending a complexity to the album that the rest of the songs did not really hint at. If their next album builds on the smart writing of this song alone, I will buy it instantly.<br />Oh, and there's that last song. But I just got rid of it, so it can end on Knights.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This is a puzzle game where you fit together tubes to mix colours that spread from sources to endpoints, making sure that the colours mix at the right places and that the entire system is sealed.  It will look familiar to fans of rail puzzles or other types of pipe games.<br /><br />What's impressive about it is how nicely done it is: the graphics are clear but pretty, the level design ramps up appropriately from tutorial levels to more complex ones, there's plenty of levels, the sound design is nice enough, and it gets hard enough to be satisfying when you find the solution without being overly frustrating while you're searching.  It's a standout within the class of puzzle games.<br /><br />(Amusingly, I find myself mentally fitting imaginary pipes for hours after playing this game, much like happens when you play too much tetris.  Guess it engages some shape-fitting part of my brain?)<br /><br />In summary: Crazy Formula is my new favourite little puzzle game, satisfying and engaging yet short enough that you can use it as a few minute brain break.  I'm almost through the bonus puzzles now, then I'll probably take a break and do it all again in a month or so!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Okay, that was a bit cheesy, but that's part of what makes star trek fun to watch.  Great job on remastering and getting the series in HD.  Not sure how they did that, but it works!  Only thing I have mixed feelings on is that many of the fx, including the Enterprise, are computer imagery, not the original models.  Some say that's ads to the experience where I would have preferred the original stock footage.  Just a preference.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|Too many facts fall by the wayside in this version of the Boleyn sisters and King Henry the VIII. True, Natalie Portman resembles portraits of the real Anne Boleyn but Scarlett Johansson looks too young and beautiful when compared to portraits of the real Mary Boleyn. Meanwhile, Eric Bana as Henry remains svelte and muscular looking throughout the movie. In real life, by the time the king was enmeshed with the sisters, he was already bloated, well on his way to obesity.<br />The tight focus on these 3 characters also leaves out pertinent facts. While the film belabors Anne's alleged incest with her brother and their resulting executions, it ignores the fact that 4 other men were also tried on charges of adultery with the queen and executed. To add to the drama, Mary is shown returning from banishment from the royal court to plead with the king to spare Anne. In reality, she never returned after her banishment.<br />But at least some of the palace intrigue that really existed is brought to light. The scene of Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife, confronting \\"the Boleyn whores\\" is classic. Their looks of utter surprise and hurt after being called out and subsequent anger were the best of many such expressions sprinkled throughout. And the emphasis of various court officials scheming and manipulating on the sidelines as they try to steer the king's many whims in directions favorable to themselves and supposedly beneficial for England reflect the shenanigans that continue on in halls of power to this day.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|My daughter watch this movie all the time. It is a great movie to have for when their friends come over!
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Cult classic.. I find myself popping this in all the time just for back round, My wife I'm sure has had enough, but I cant get enough. The dude falls into a pile and comes out Smelling like roses and has coitus to boot!!! Outstanding.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|All right, I got this as one of the daily free apps.  Never played Sudoku before, and thought this would be a great way to see what it's about.<br /><br />Nicely laid out game.  Excellent, progressive help system (if you tap the plus sign after hitting the hint button, it will continue to give more hints to build on each other until you are finally told what should be put where in the grid).  Great color schemes and use of highlights.<br /><br />Oh, and the statistics thing I mentioned?  It's the only downside to this game.  Not that it isn't good to have; rather, because of it, I found that I do little else in my free time besides playing this great game!
1594746036|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but I immediately became consumed in the plot. Sometimes, authors drag things out before getting to the good stuff. Not this book. It's brilliant in so many ways. A must read for young and old alike.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome chilling sweet amazing makes me want to read all your books seven times best book I read I loved it
B00CH87HF4|3.0|It is good and the graphics are good. But I wish you could your own character. I am looking for game like that.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The movie is pretty much all you can ask from a supet heto romp. Likeable characters, plemty of action and some occasional comic relief.
B006LSZECO|5.0|having read raving reviews about this novel I decided to buy it for my Kindle. I was at first hesitant since so MANY people wrote negatively about the ending. However, I was NOT disappointed in the book! It is cleverly written and has a great story line. It contains so many observation about men and women; those felt like extra side notes to the main plot. It reads very well and keeps you interested enough by revealing the plot in small doses so you don't feel like you need to skip to the ending while, in the process of skipping, missing all the small twists and turns, and entertaining observations, along the way.<br />As for the ending - i thought it was fitting even though not explosive finale. That's how people are and most things in life end in an ordinary (as opposed to Hollywood-like) fashion. Although, i would not call the ending ordinary. It was a weird resolution to which many people would not agree (had it happened to them).
B008XKSW7M|3.0|This was a somewhat entertaining movie.  Would not call it a blockbuster movie.  The lighthearted  humor will do well with the new generation of 30 something's.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is great . It tells you what your battery percentage is and it even tells you if your kindle is healthy or not.Meaning to much data or viruses. I use it every day.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I like this season too. I think season 1 was better. I really enjoy the characters and stories.  I'm looking forward to #3.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|the story line was good, but John Travolta ruined the whole movie with his horrible fake Bosnian accent, too bad.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great cast!  I loved this edgy, moving movie.  The cast of characters make this a movie to remember.  Gotta love it!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I'm a die-hard Fall Out Boy fan, and was so glad when they announced they were putting out a new record. Save Rock And Roll met and exceeded all my expectations, I think it is one of the best records of the year (I would say the best but I don't know if I can be objective). I recommend it to anyone who appreciates and loves music, and specially to every FOB fan out there!
0756404738|5.0|The Kingkiller Chronicles are mesmerizing. Absolutely one of favorite literary characters and a must for fiction and fantasy fans. I can't wait for the next one.
B00C81LYH2|4.0|The little girls who received this Barbie absolutely adored her.  They have probably already torn her to shreds.  It's a really pretty doll any little girl would love.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book gives incredible insight into the lives, the spirit and the Fraternal Warrior Brotherhood that is the Navy Seals !!!  Even though I know not one moment of warfare or BUDS training is easy, Marcus and other Seal Authors talk about it like it's &#34;No Big Deal.&#34;  Absolute Hero's, One and all.  Gives me something to be proud of these days.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|amazing awesome outstanding I adore it I don't care about the flaws I give it 5 star<br /> love it alot
0062255657|4.0|A truly beautiful book as an adult fairy tale. Scary, witty, imaginative, and winsome in going back to yesteryear and deciding what is real and what is not.
0553801473|1.0|I am so pissed off about this book.  I was lucky enough to have all five books to read at once, since I came late to the series. The first books were riveting, and it was addictive...I kept hoping for SOME sort of plot line to develop in the last two, at least.  It just keeps getting more convoluted.  I like a novel, or a series, to have an end.  We know life just keeps going on, but a book should have an end, a conclusion. Another reviewer said it better:  a bunch of characters in search of a plot.  And the characters weren't all that great either. From a strong compelling start, they have all degenerated into fodder for the author to carry on the series.  It's not a story anymore, it's material for the scriptwriters.<br /><br />I must add that I never read the books until I saw snippets of the HBO series (although in hindsight I can't remember matching any scenes I saw to the book, but again it was just snippets - free HBO over some holiday weelend).  The first two or three books were amazing storylines and kept me reading, to the point I was on my kindle app on the phone, my computer at work, and my kindle.  SOO disappointed that there was no conclusion, only more smoke and fog and random hard to believe characters.
B004UID2LC|1.0|How about you not make thing okay I mean that now there is no we're to watch youtube anymore and your going to make and app that is a  gilch or bugged so you can't do anything on duty look at stuff you don't like at all so plez fix your the only hope for youtube unit that probably  not true
1846556007|5.0|The Jo Nesbo books have quickly become my favorite in regards to crime fiction. Harry Hole is very flawed and brilliant detective with heart of a lion. Do yourself a favor and start at the beginning, since this book has just come out in English translation.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book(s).  Some of my friends said that the sex was too explicit.  However, I DISAGREE.  The sex was great, the storyline was even greater and the plot was fantastic.  PLEASE, PLEASE COME OUT WITH A SEQUEL TO THIS BOOK.  I would love to see the middle (and then later) years with Ana and Christian.
B002KGEORM|4.0|Went through season two faster than I did season one. Really like I can stop anywhere and pick it up later.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the author and there always seems to be something new - he did not disappoint. This was among my favorites of his novels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just loved this show about so many different groups of actors who are incredibly good at their acting you are glued to this
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Casablanca is one of those timeless classics that people will watch forever.  What puzzles me is why does Amazon have it listed under comedies?  I have watched this movie at least 15 times and have never once thought of it as a comedy.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love the case, I am on the go and on the phone a lot it nice to be able to charge the headset while on the move.<br /><br />Would recommend Seller and Product to anyone!!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son plays the most when we are running to the store or camping. I wish it had some more minions but it all still a great game.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Having recently watched a string of Leone's Westerns, I can see how he did so well in the States. Somehow, he takes these relatively simple plots, and makes them epic. The juxtaposition with the Civil War is simply awesome. In some ways, the bunker scene seems really out of place, but it's that jarring experience that makes it Leone. The good guy, the bad guy, and the so-called, ugly one live in a world of death (of sorts), but it's nothing in comparison to the soldiers. The main characters live in a fantasy world of guns and gold, but in reality, thousands are actually fighting and dying. Love it
0425263924|5.0|such a wonderful series. cant get enough of them. each book i have read within DAYS! hope there is more to come
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best I've ever played in my life. Super funny and u can play this all day.
1781162646|3.0|This book was not at all what I expected of Stephen King. It was not very scary, ghosts were barely a part of the story. About the middle it became an interesting story of a young man getting over his first love and meeting a very kind &#34;Mrs. Robinson&#34; . Finally an interesting read but I wanted to be thrilled, and scared , and have ghosts prevalent in the story and that is not how it was written..
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Overall, I thought this book had a good message and a good storyline. Although, a few details were a little off subject and could have been organized a little better. The beginning and the end were like two different stories. I would recommend this book for younger readers. I was never bored throughout the book, but some details were a little questionable. Definitely worth giving this book a try.
1400069807|4.0|This is a book that I needed for a class/seminar, but would have bought it anyway.<br />Anyone concerned with diet, health and/or nutrition should read this book!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very inspiring and straightforward. It is a really good short read. Makes you believe on your ideas and your imagination
B0098460O4|5.0|Like my title says this is an awesome CD!! I saw them on Britian's Got Talent I think it was & was floored!!! Got goose bumps then & still do now when I hear them sing! Looking forward to their next CD & hope they one day soon tour the good ole US of A!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't stop playing! Excellent for extra free time or just procrastinating from homework! It wasn't easily done but not impossible either! Just great!
B001FQFFMG|5.0|We need more movies like this!  So inspiring!  I love the great acting and how it is a movie for the whole family to watch.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Ok...I know someone is probably going to bring up a great remake I forgot about...but as of right now I can honestly say this was the best remake I have ever seen. I love the original Evil Dead movies, and I was pretty much against this one. I only watched it out of anger, expecting to be annoyed and disappointed. And I was completely surprised!!! I really loved it. This movie was more of a \\"tribute\\". You can see the nods to the original, but its never exactly the same.<br />Pretty cool.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much playing this game i always love to play. I beat levels pretty fast though. Anyways this game is great.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|A solid effort, but not quite as strong as Thirteen.  With all the material MegaDave has put out over the last few years, it would seem the ideas might be getting a little thinner.  Still, as a hard rock-to-metal album, it is solid and a good purchase for Mega fans.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Laugh and cry. Characters keep the show very interesting. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great. Keep more episodes coming! Cannot wait for season 4. :).
B009JBZH54|5.0|is very good, come 5 albums, two movies in Full HD, 2 discs of content, and that the description of the car designs of all of the above films, everything is very well detailed, and comes a disc with the movie Batman begins, along with the content of the movie, in addition the book also comes with the best pictures from the movies, and the presentation is perfect!
1451695195|5.0|The experience discussed in the book is very interesting, because it is comforting to know that what the Bible describes as no more pain, total peace, joy -- etc, are in conformity with the authors description of Heaven. The book is captivating and the language is eluquent. The scientific analysis of his experience was quite intriguing; as a scientist and a Christian, I could identify the truthfulness, especially, after investigating from those who were around him at the time of his coma. It is a very good book to read for your Christian inspiration.
1452113432|3.0|This is not a typical cook book for French recipes.  Some of the items I know my French friends never heard of and never made.  I was slightly disappointed because I wanted everyday recipes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should freaking get this game Foreal it's so awesome it's so addictive. Just last night I was playing it non stop they should continue on making the games their so far good at it, you will be my BEST friend of you download this game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a fun game to play when you have nothing to do and the boss battles add excitement to the game also
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I don't know what I'm going to do with my time until the next book come out! Such an interesting absorbing read!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I Love this game it's so addicting to play and all the other story games!!!<br />The dragons are so cute and there's nothing like this story game!!<br />Thank you for making this story and the other story's and I hope that there will be more story games in store! Thanks for having the time to read this review :)
B005DNOAQY|4.0|It's a classic Woody Allen movie, in which Woody is the main character and is both neurotic and clumsy...but more so than usual. \\"Play it Again, Sam\\" was originally a Play that was turned into a movie. If you like Woody Allen's other movies, chances are you will like this one too.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|The book was good I like all of the books but this was the best I going to read more of them I can't wait
B0034DGPEU|5.0|read as a part of book club if you enjoyed the help, you will enjoy this.  I would recommend you read
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Started playing this game now can't stop.  I love hidden object games that make you think a little...really enjoying myself!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After seeing all of the great reviews I was excited to get this installed for my kids.  Unfortunately the app does not get beyond the loading.  After reading further into the reviews I see that this is happening to other people after a recent update.  Until the issue is fixed in a new update, do not install this app.
0307279189|5.0|This book was more than fantastic. Inspirational in so many ways. It has lead to me start running again! Christopher McDougall is an phenomenal writer.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've waited a while to write a review to see how this mouse would hold up. I've gone and beaten thru 3 mouses due to a lot of clicking while gaming. specifically I play a lot of League of Legends. pretty happy with the mouse so far, the customization interface could be a bit better explaining what things do when adjusting settings. but overall a Great mouse for the price!
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Thankfully I haven't started the book series yet [i even have the books]...I read all the Bourne books by &#34;Ludlum&#34; and the movies were never entertaining because of the books [10 times better story in print - so much good stuff was left out]...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I love the way is told. I would totally recommend this book to anyone who like action and romance.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like this game because I have to use my brain a little bit but not so much that I can't relax, which is the main reason I play games like this. It would be better if it gave you  the option of skipping the dialog for the entire game or for entire chapters instead of just one scene at a time.
0385349947|4.0|My specialty is so-called advanced analytics; the book, from my professional perspective, is porous in logic and in analytical organization. It rumbles quite a bit.<br /><br />My total income from reading this book, however, is ranked among top 5 among all the books I remember reading. Here are some specific dot comments (forgive me, I am being candid too)<br /><br />1. The discussion of the imposter syndrome (~P29) is per se a bit arrogant, although quietly so. It is not problematic since the person seems to have the height and the foundation.<br /><br />2. The 'flat A' (p33): it is not that men don't regret that they forgot something in their exam answers. Men probably don't openly talk about that as often; doing so may appear weak. The trait that you get an A and still regret about is what makes you more successful in your next job. I admire that in SS. I am a bit turned off by people who drink a lot right after exams. I live in Chestnut Hill, MA, the middle of arguably the country's best college town. I see many student swamp bars and restaurants upon the completion of a quarter. I wonder how much regret is behind the drinks and parties<br /><br />3. Connecting with Larry Summers: many say SS got lucky and was on fast track once getting into LS's wing and network. The thing is: as it turns out now, Larry's 'pick' of SS apparently is a great one. Obviously Larry cannot possibly pick everybody that passes into his radar. The deciding factor I suppose has lot of to do with SS<br /><br />4. This book is rumble-in-writing. It may not score very high as a sociological thesis. In citing findings and publications to get points moving, the skill is not there at advanced levels. The kill, the intellectual bent and edge, however, is felt throughout. If you read this book to get to know her better, this style serves better. I am glad she is not co-writing the book with a 'biographer'.<br /><br />I am not sure how and what to use the 34 pages of Notes (Page 183 to Page 217):why this book needs to put Notes at the end?<br /><br />5. The 'sit-at-table' story (p27): Perhaps in the conference room in DC, the ladies were used to not come straight to the tables where seating means ranking, seniority, factions, power, authorities,...<br />structured, while a conference room in the West Coast naturally is more unstructured. So attributing<br />the ladies slow to the table side to gender roles may be a bit too fast 'out of confounding'<br /><br />6. The book uses quite many experiment findings, many of which are self-reporting and are good for news reporting, but not analytically rigorous. A lot of generalizations are hasty. In the field of analytics, at least as far as I know, we don't comment on female colleagues' style, success, personality, or likability. Your success is in your work. There could also be geo-difference: a DC suburban area may have very different gender culture from Brookline, MA.<br /><br />7. The whole page 42 deservers reading multiple times. Every graduate school dean who intends to improve his or her performance rating system must read this page<br /><br />8. How not to create environment where speaking up about one's own success is weighted too much towards self-promotion is interesting managerial subject. In the world today where emails prevail over speaker phone, girls are not necessarily lacking channel of speaking out.<br /><br />9. I don't agree that women go out to negotiate their salary and they have to justify it. Among other things, the one sitting across the table negotiating on behalf of the company is a woman.<br /><br />The book, after page 90, starts to hurry up. 'Reading value' goes down precipitously. I don't have many bright spots to comment on.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|So I normally dont write reviews, but with this cd I just had to. I put this cd on in the car and was first thinkng, ok so how many songs do I have to skip through until I find a few I actually like. But shockingly I ended up listening to the whole cd without skipping one song! Which is a hard thing to do with a cd, so by far I would say this is the best cd from bsb. I can't stop listening to it over and over!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for any kid that plays action games. I love it and so does my daughter. We enjoy the game so much.
0385483821|1.0|It's a shame Grove didn't write an autobiography of his amazing life. Instead he gives us a 200 page rendering of the obvious.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love y this game fun but not to hard great game me and my mom b help each other out with it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PROGRAM.  I FEEL LIKE I'M ONE OF THEM.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW SEASON TO START.
0763644765|5.0|We have quite a few potty training books, but this one is by far my son's favorite. We keep it in the bathroom as a treat.  It's so simple and entertaining.  When my son first went pee pee in the potty in front of Daddy, he did EXACTLY what the characters in the book do.  Hands in the air, running around, screaming \\"I DID IT!\\"  And he gets excited about \\"UNDIES!\\" like it says in the book.  HIGHLY recommend.  (And also 3 Day Potty Training eBook for parents.  Awesome.)
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is a cute game that is fun to play. There arent that many levels though.  I would have given 5 stars if there were more levels.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This author does a wonderful  job developing the characters and weaving the plot of this story. This is a mysterious tale that kept my interest throughout the book.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by a screenwriting coach as an example of dual perspective - going back and forth in time- in the story of a marriage. That aspect met and exceeded my expectations, but the surprising element was the crisp and double-edge dialogue that made me sit up and really pay attention. In addition, I loved the fact that the language was powerful but understated -no gratuitous profanity-  and the sexual content was implied rather than seen. The superb acting was not surprise, of course.  They just don't make movies like this anymore.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is just a wonderful book, with a very moving story, about how love transcends all. I would recommend it to everyone!
B003Y5H59C|1.0|I purchased this DVD months ago and finally got home from work in time to watch it the other night just to find that it doesn't play.  I tried it in a different DVD player and it still won't play.  Very disappointed!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this , not sure that I could live with out it. worked with numbers for all of my career, now that I'm retired l prefer using a adding machine.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What I loved about this book was how Brooks smartly creates the scenarios.  Also, how each nation faces the zombie crisis is well-thought out and based on research.  It is more fascinating than scary but it does have its scary moments.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Awesome!!!yay I love this app. I don't have a problems with it. Harry Styles and I don't know what you are all the way to be annoying or not
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Originally saw this movie at a theater & loved it. Haven't watched it yet on my Kindle Fire but will do this after I finish a book I'm currently reading.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|it was a great movie ,with lots of laughter and how family's are made . Not all familys are happy .
B008I43DYU|5.0|I have this same app on my cell phone & I use it a lot. Very convenient. I don't have to go find a calculator when I need one.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I still enjoyed the old favorite family movie , That can make me smile, laugh and cheer for the good people . I have not gotten tried of great family movie that easy to watch over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is not too hard. You do have to memorize some of the clues to use in a different area. Haven't finished yet.. Will have to see if it gets harder.<br />Conlyn
B009FZHYKU|3.0|The show is obviously great but when I tried to view it via instant streaming, it didn't want to load. Nothing. At all. Then I decided to download it and it worked out perfectly fine. Only other problem is that it took about 2 to 3 hours to download... Overall, it was good. Great quality. I just wish I didn't have to waste memory on my computer.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Good set up with a hollow finish<br /><br />Dan brown t<br />Tells a very good tale but this was nowhere near as good as his first two in the series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow I love this app my best friend and I love it we play all the time if only I could figure out how to update it
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|I thought the acting and actors and actresses in Dead Man Down were excellent....the expressions on their faces were so good and the quality of their acting was so good and so subtle. It was suspenseful and exciting and thriling and kept you on the edge of your seat. The camera work and photography was beautiful. You didn't feel like they were acitng, you got drawn into the story and you forgot you were watching a movie!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Don't like the kindle, interface, interference of amazon, any of it. Not user friendly, this is why i have apple to begin with. Gonna return and get an iPad.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This was okay.  There are other Neil Gaiman stories that I liked better. This was too much like a made-for-TV script.  Characters were not very believable.
0517543052|5.0|I first read Be Here Now in 1973... I am re-reading it now, and Truth is truth and timeless.  This is a classic on the spiritual path!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Loved everything about this book - characters, development, contrasts, story line.  Neil Gaiman at his finest. Probably one of his best works.  Made up for The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
0553381709|4.0|it was a gift and he's finishing it now. Likes the story line, but it's long! Hasn't started book 4 yet.
B008X0T3CU|1.0|Maybe do a show that has a lot less naked people and foul language and little more truth and content. I guess stupid Neanderthals may have found the show good. But if your whole life is not wrapped around sex this show lacks. Also really only uneducated or idiots cannot express emotion without using foul language every other word.
030758836X|5.0|Love this author & how the story was told from both point of views - highly entertaining & couldn't put it down~
B005GHN2GG|4.0|I give this 4 stars only because it drags a bit here and there as though Grace Draven wanted the book to be a bit thicker.  However, I truly enjoyed the writing, the fully developed characters and the &#34;feelable&#34; descriptions.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game My Horse because it entertains me when I'm bored or when I am in the car for a long period of time.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Almost finished.  I'm amazed at fantasy writers these days.  Such fully developed characters, such creativity in building their worlds, and, my, the intelligence and obvious research or at least thorough thought and care in development of all.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I have become not only a Lord of the Rings junkie but a Peter Jackson junkie.<br />The Hobbit is a great adventure and since my TV is 3D I purchased the 3D BLu-Ray<br />DVD,  this is one of my Go To Movies when I don't want to watch TV.  The 3D affect is<br />amazing and since purchasing I must have watched about 20 times.  Like all great<br />movies it is one I can watch again and again and again and well you get the idea
B004D1CK32|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for some time after watching The Magnificent 7, and talking with someone that said it had been based on this movie.  Very nice spend of 3 1/2 hours.  Loved the action, and all of the portrayals of the Samurai.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have the Kindle editions of the trilogy and the Hunger Games DVD, they are filled with<br />excitement and by the end of the Hunger Games you are in a mix of emotions.  I was<br />torn between wanting Peeta & Catnis to stay together yet sad because if they did then Gale<br />would be hurt because he loves Catnis.<br /><br />Even though I read Catching Fire and MockingJay and know how the series ends I really can't<br />wait for the movies to come out.  Jennifer Lawrence is so good in her character this will surely<br />become a movie classic
B00A8ECU24|3.0|kills time. originally got it for my four year old and ending up playing as well I just don't like how much things cost it the game.
B000005B0U|5.0|CD is full of great old blues songs performed by the Bules Brothers Band and guest artists such as Jonny Lang.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|i love these old songs . and i love eric's music. well worth  it. i have a lot of eric clapton's music. this is one of my favorites .
B00CWEQ62S|1.0|I'm not big on comic books. The real novels are damn good. This pitiful drawing steal away the wonderful worlds I imagine.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This film is a portrayal of a socialist liberal state at it's ultimate end. You can take it from Hitler's own words, in his exact words from his book. His vision is portrayed in painful detail in this movie...if you are human you will have trouble watching what is shown.<br /><br />I'd caution any parent allowing anyone under the age of 18 from viewing this film, except for educational purposes; the content requires adult supervision.<br /><br />For the student of history....you should carefully observe this film and correlate it's links to past world history with current history. Nazi's had planned parenthood....Americans have planned parenthood. This is relevant because of the drastic socialist shift within the American state; a shift from individuals to collectives. The jump from abortion to euthanasia is not a big jump. The disarmament of citizens to control of sects is not a big leap. (Destruction of religion, destruction of rights, destruction of the family, destruction of social norms, destruction of the individual human......it has been done before and has one inevitable outcome.)<br /><br />This film is relevant because America is Germany in 1937.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A classic!! I loved it as a kid, and just recently watched with my kids and they loved it too! In fact, they just watched it for a second time last night.
B0053O89KG|5.0|one if not the best seasons in the series to date!!!! just  a classic formula, funny n whitty storylines that never disappoint!!!
0345543971|5.0|Better than the HBO series. More information and better character development. Explains the familial relationships more fully. Also great appendix for keeping track of the characters.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|as usual season five doesn't disappoint, the series goes into new territory story wise, and is so damn funny!!!! =)
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I don't know why I downloaded this app, I've never even opened it that I can recall.  Must have been drinking that night.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This is an amazing show, I was turned onto by a good friend of mine, great stories, wonderful actors, and any fans of Firefly will ove the odd refrences every now n then!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is such an awesome series....i never want it to end!!! The characters are so well written that you&#34;ll end up loving all of them, even the ones you hate!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|My grandson who is 3 loves this game.  He saw an ad for 2 while playing the first version.  I had to get it.  He always asks if there are more!  I do not know the answer.  If there are, he'll be sure to have it!
0307279189|5.0|This book was a fun read.. i couldnt set it down other than to go run. i think it's probably a good read for beginners or pro's alike.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Dr who I'd a great show. Good fun in sci fi and very good story.  Can even have emotional at times.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|If you're a Johnny Depp fan, go for it. I must say I admire his chameleon acting qualities, which is what makes him such a watchable fellow, but having been a fan of the original series, I can't say comedifying the storyline was an improvement.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Ford presents a wonderful story of a boy whose life is about as complicated as can be imagined, but is still meaningful and believable.  This is a great book for me, it is very different from the &#34;spy thrillers&#34; I love, but a very compelling story of life if as it really is.  As a real life goose-hunter, his descriptions are very accurate....about the hunt, but more so about the hunters, and those who organize the hunts.
B00003XB8K|5.0|Like usual another great album. With each new Enigma  album, it is always better the the last one and they are all great . Again listen to it over and over.
B007SGM084|5.0|Addicting ..... couldn't put down the kindle. Read all three books in about a week. Recommend for others to read :)
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Just... fantastic.  Great incorporation of characters from the 9th and 10th Doctors.  Companians, family, Time Agents, Torchwood.... Daleks... all make an appearance.  Great wrap up of the Donna season.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did.  I tried.  But in the end I couldn't.  It was the first time that I had read a book by Gillian Flynn.  I will have to try another book by her before I write her off.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I was lucky that this app came around as the FAOTD. The graphics and gameplay are both excellent, although I am only on Chapter 4. I do think that the dialogue takes a bit too much time, but I also appreciate that the puzzles themselves aren't timed, because I think it takes away from the experience of solving them thoughtfully when they are. Overall, I give it four stars. With a few more instructions and a bit less talking, it would be five.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|You know they had to have a great time filming these shows using cardboard props and paper mache landscapes, while still managing to get the storyline almost believable.<br /><br />Too bad it only made three seasons.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I had an excellent time playing through the game itself and finished in a few days. The puzzles are quite fun, although by the end of the game they were getting repetitive. The large variety of puzzle types was the best thing about the game. The puzzle types reminded me of the Professor Layton series.<br />Unfortunately, when I logged on to post a five star review, I saw some concerns others had about access to accounts. If I am not able to edit those settings, I will delete the game promptly. I would like to see the developer post a response the the reviews regarding privacy; I don't believe they should be ignoring the issue if they plan to develop a sequel.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I love this feature that allows you to print from your phone directly to your wireless printer, easy to use and works great.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is a television show? That's the thought that keeps bouncing in my head whenever I watch an episode of Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Each dark, tortured, back-stabbing, manipulative, seductive, deceitful, captivating episode is like an hour-long movie. Each one keeps me guessing and on the edge of my seat. The acting is flawless as each actor has been perfectly cast for their part.<br /><br />I have to admit that I &#34;gorged&#34; on Season 2 after purchasing it to stream from Amazon. I spent an entire weekend glued to the screen watching the various story lines continue to unfold from season one.<br /><br />To be honest, I resisted Game of Thrones for the first two seasons, which is why I am streaming online now (and becasue I do not have cable or satellite). I thought an epic saga with multiple story lines, set in a fantasy world where magic and dragons and undead and brave knights and fair maids and the list goes on...could not possibly maintain superior production values and writing and acting...but it has.<br /><br />And that is why I am hooked.<br /><br />The streaming quality from Amazon was excellent. The price was worth it. And I look forward to season three.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. I play it all day every day. Just the fact of being a minion I do not know is great.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|read my title I think I said it all right there.  If you dont believe me buy this album and you will know I'm telling the truth
0316247545|5.0|In lieu of an actual DVD box set for the seasons so far, this serves as a nice refresher, as well as providing fun insights into the world and interesting interviews from the creators. Good for anyone who is a big fan of the series, young or old.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book was somewhat entertaining.  I don't enjoy books with supernatural themes. Maybe a teenager would be amused, I usually give a book at least 100 pages to show he it's worth.  I finished this one thinking maybe something interesting was bound to happen. It did not.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My 11 year old got the epic 5 days ago. He has spent hours playing with it and loves it. At first he could hardly get passed the first 6 challenges, but today made it to #102. I'm sure he will beat it eventually! Quality seems just fine. I would recommend it for older children or adults.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I had not read this book since high school and forgot how totally depressive it is.  It was also pretty disgusting.
161655164X|5.0|Most of comment about this artbook is spoil by given too much detail about story, well most of artbook is spoiler anyway but since The Last of Us is about story wised,yes! play first if you can.<br />Naughty Dog team is very generous to share about their knowledge like we saw inside Uncharted 2 video game extras.<br /><br />But the most amazing part from this artbook is very well organized, from the very beginning of concept story until the end part, you can almost feel and learn about their direction for creating such a great masterpiece work of video games on The Last of Us. You can read their narration along this artbook is about design decision, in-depth character also building atmosphere, etc<br /><br />it's great and very insightful for game developer wannabe like me :)
0345528581|5.0|It was a gift and sent directly to my grandson. He says its good, and I agree.  Job well done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it made me feel like i was there along with them, living a world different than in the current century
1400079144|5.0|It was a gift and sent directly to my grandson. He says its good, and I agree.  Job well done.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is hard and i cant beat it but it is a good strategic game I recommend it to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game, good for people of all ages.All my family is hooked on this game, u just can't put it down, it's good addiction, fun!!!!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Amazing insight to the family and hela cells. Learned more about the history of the woman behind the cells. Helps to humanize science and research
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can't stop playing it. I don't usually rate games but I had to do my first review on this extremely challenging fun game . Must download!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I spend hours on it and my man gets jealous, which is funny. I enjoy the task you have to complete and races you get to play. I enjoy the gifts you receive from friends and the fact that you can send gifts because i don't have enough cash to buy coins and gems. If it wasn't for my friends, I wouldn't be able to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game ever I looooooooooooove this game I love love love it I love minecraft to so no hate
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I just bought the despicable me blu ray + DVD pack and amazon have this as a GIFT, I was pleasantly surprised! Thanks amazon!
B00065MDSQ|4.0|Very good cd.Fun to listen to it and its a lot different from what i expected.I had heard from friends about this recording,and i had high hopes.From the beginning i hear some inspiration from Mahavishnu Orchestra.I must say i didn't get my hopes pleased.I personally rank Dicipline and Three of a perfect pair as overall better cd's.Adrian Belew makes some of the big difference, his voice and also his guitar sounds.So i give it 4 stars because i feel they have more than they gave in this effort.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Not only did I love the first season, but my expectations were met and went above and beyond as I watched this season! Definitely a good buy.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I was looking for an app that would recognize the media streaming service I already had setup to share files on my pc.  This app with no effort at all imediatly did just that.  It was the first app that I tries so there might be a better one but I installed, started the app, selected my media server and started watching a movie all in about a minute.  So with that give it a try.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites, I could watch it over and over again. It is worth every penny!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It has sum clips from the movie. It's  fun. It has minions. You can chose what minion that you  would  love the most. The  best  game ever.
B000WKT6C6|5.0|I'm no reviewer but want to say that I love this album. J.J. was somewhat of an unknown genius and his recent passing is our great loss. My husband and I enjoyed his music very much in the 1970s when we were young and married. I lost track of him later on. At news of his passing, I bought this album. I always get into rhythms and background instruments before I ever even hear words in a song. So I'm especially grooving on the wonderful guitar licks! The popular music of today shows no comparison to such talent as J.J. Cale's.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a great game. It thank it would be a great game for the entire family. It is a game is a game for the kids
B000TXG3YA|5.0|Baroness' first full-length studio effort, \\"Red Album,\\" is primarily a piece of sludge metal, albeit one with progressive, grindcore, and post-hardcore tinges.  And like all great sludgecore releases, this one is rooted in Southern influences, as Baroness do hail from Atlanta, Georgia. The end result was not only one of the best metal releases of the year (2007), but also one of the genre's modern-day landmarks. It frequently ventures into lengthy, sustained instrumental journeys, thus showcasing the band's more progressive side; but it also is no stranger to bludgeoning sludge, with a lot of really memorable riffs and visceral vocals.<br /><br />True, Baroness do wear their influences proudly on their sleeves throughout \\"Red Album.\\" Those influences include The Melvins, Deep Purple, Pentagram, Isis, Gojira, and, of course, Black Sabbath. But some other influences boil to the surface, here, too, including Mastodon (see \\"Isak,\\" which, despite featuring a noteworthy bass intro, is primarily built around huge, meaty, Mastodon-sized doom riffage) and Pelican (i.e. \\"Grad\\" is a very Pelican-influenced number in that it is entirely instrumental and builds from a quiet intro to a sizeable, climactic, and brutal conclusion). And besides, this might not be one of the most trailblazing, genre-redefining records of the decade, but it is proof of the fact that Baroness bares some of the finest chops in all of modern-day sludge/doom/stoner metal.<br /><br />\\"Red Album\\" opens with perhaps its biggest highlight in \\"Rays On Pinion.\\" It is a very sprawling and epic number whose first four-minutes or so is occupied by really proggy territory, with quiet guitar strumming and melodic bass work. But then the tune turns to heavy, sludgy rhythms, throaty, Mastodon-esque vocals, dramatic, thundering drum rolls, and crunching doom riffage. It all makes for one terrifically progressive and again epic song, and one that clocks in at a whopping total of 7.5 minutes in length. And the rest of the album does not disappoint, either, even though not of the remaining songs can claim to be QUITE as remarkable as the above-described opener. \\"Wailing Wintry Wind\\" comes close, though, as it is another extremely progressive and expansive number that begins with four-plus minutes of progressive guitar figures before becoming heavy and bullying. And the whole thing clocks in at an epic six minutes long, too.<br /><br />And there are ample other standouts to be had, here, too. In fact, it almost seems like everywhere you look, there is a remarkable song. \\"The Birthing,\\" for example, marries more of these same throaty, Troy Sanders-esque roars with a soaring clean backing vocal line, sludgy, staccato grooves, and ominous bass grumbles. Then, following \\"Cockroach En Fleur,\\" a very pretty and proggy instrumental interlude with gorgeous acoustic guitar plucking, comes \\"Wanderlust,\\" which anchors crunchy, tasty riffs and lumbering rhythms with thundering, humming, reflective bass throbs. And the track also is of note for venturing into an epic and extensive, drawn-out instrumental break.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Aleph\\" is a darn near entirely instrumental piece with a proggy intro followed by more brutal, Mastodon-ian riffing, and the succeeding \\"Teeth Of A Cogwheel\\" plays more-or-less like a continuation of it, as it actually IS a completely instrumental epic, and one that is centered around some really dexterous and jazzy-sounding drum fills. The album concludes with \\"Untitled,\\" a brief, Southern metal-flavored rawker, but not before dropping \\"O'Appalachia,\\" which is easily one of the record's most viscerally satisfying pieces. It is, after all, an unusually up-tempo sludge/doom metal riff-fest. (Some meaty, thunderously downtuned, and chugging guitar leads abound throughout this beast.)<br /><br />Aggressive (but not necessarily angry most of the time), crunchy, brutal yet simultaneously tuneful, and filled with instrumental chops aplenty. Such is the beauty of \\"Red Album.\\" And when you add intelligent and fairly intricate songwriting to the mix, the result is easily one of the finest and most satisfying Sabbath-inspired metal records of the new millennium, and Baroness a very promising and easy-to-like group..\\" And when you add intelligent and fairly intricate songwriting to the mix, the result is easily one of the finest and most satisfying Sabbath-inspired metal records of the new millennium, and Baroness a very promising and easy-to-like group.
014241493X|5.0|Paper Towns was one of many books from the same author that I read this summer.  True to his form, John Green provided excellent character development with an endearing plot.  I anticipated young adult &#34;fluff&#34;, but this book was meaningful and thought provoking as well.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|I love Bob Marley's music, but really didn't know much about him.  Very interesting and well done. Recommend for Marley fans.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time is one of my favorite TV shows on ABC. Unfortunately it's mostly on when I'm at work, so the convenience of this being on amazon instant video is/was amazing.
0385344228|5.0|Great book that keeps you at the edge of seat, and also is a little upsetting at the same time.
B009KYQNSA|5.0|This is an intelligent, sexy, and action packed yarn about a seemingly simple pot business that turns deadly. Great acting, great plot, a bit of Okiver Stone wackiness. Well done.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson and I were really enjoying this game until they upgraded the game. Now we can not get the game to load at all. I hope that this problem is fixed soon. I really hats seeing a three year old upset because he can not play the one game he loves.
B007SXB498|5.0|I choose this book because I watched the movie three times.  Personally I enjoyed both.  Will admit I could see the characters from the movie while reading the book.  The wonderful thing about books - you can go back and read more details.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I couldn't resist this for the price. I read reviews and I think the quality is fine.  I have not used it, but wanted it just in case I am out taking pictures and want to use a tripod.  Will come in handy if I want to take a picture of me without having to hold the camera at arms length.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite author. His books keep you entertained beginning to end and this is no exception. I suggest you read the series (Mitch Rapp) in order.  I am sorry that there will be no more. Rest in Peace Vince.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|Seal Six 's mission and bravery were the only high points in this movie. The inside look at the torture and other low-life tactics used by the CIA was unsettling. How do you condemn one people for acting like animals and do the same things yourself ?
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|The game itself is okay. Nice graphics. Good mental stimulation. But it was unstable on my smart phone: it simple disappeared after a day.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|A good, ugly, in your face look at America in the 1800s. Christoph Waltz was simply brilliant! The ending was too Hollywoody and utterly corny.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Amazing the liberties a adapter will take when scripting a movie from a novel.<br /><br />Quite frankly...I liked the movie better and that's the opposite of how I usually feel.<br /><br />This book is hard to get into, but, once you do, it grips you.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is so good! I didn't know anything about the PCT until I started reading this story. It's an easy read and her writing style just drew me in entirely. Got me thinking about looking into hiking the PCT or the Applachian Trail someday!

B009A882D0|3.0|This band is great in the recording studio,producing great albums.  However live,they sound bad. Not enough drums or bass just the lead singer wanted to shine a little too much for himself. I heard other live music by them and not so great.
1476733953|4.0|Wool was a great story, though it took almost 25% of the book to really get into it.  I had a hard time at the beginning because I had gotten attached to 3 characters that were killed off right away.  The main character isn't even introduced till about 15% in and then we don't see much of her until at least the 25% mark.  It was a good story overall and the rest of the series is also great.  I would definitely recommend reading this and the rest in this series.
B00A861QMM|3.0|The game is good but does not play well on smaller screens. I have a Kindle 7 inch and it is very hard to see the screen.  Most the time I just touch the screen all over or use the hint to get most of them.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|I do not like the creator of this simulator becuase he took my money for yis first two simulators his absolute rc som and his absolute heli sim. I payed two vucks for each and then he wants to charge more money for plane I aleeady had on a sim that didnt work anymore after adding more planes to the sim. So now im stuck with the basics and I want mymoney back or I want a full paid version of this game.not everyone has money and im strugglomg to get moremparts for plane at home with my current income with car onsurance taking up most of my money and only leaving me about 5 dollars spending money. I want to face the developer to see why he couldnt make a compatible update so I would still hqve my planes.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|nicec game challaging puzzles, with little hidden thing's everywhere. very cheesy makes me think of Monty python with the cut out people talking.
0385486804|4.0|I think that the protagonist of the story undermines the power of the nature.  He believed that he could overcome nature through his journey to Alaska, and from the experience, he could gain valuable insights.  I admire the protagonist's courage and determination, but I also believe that he is selfish and not caring about his parents and all the people who love him.  Disregarding his worried family, the protagonist decided to tramp into the wild, which eventually resulted in tragedy.
1451673442|4.0|A perfect tool for changing one's life by applying a tried and true spiritual practice.  It is user friendly and requires a little work.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This movie was extremely good for its witty humor, dark plot and amazing soundtrack. I've watched it more than once since I bought it. I recommend watching it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|As with all Gaiman novels, geared towards adults or not, you'll quickly find yourself lost in the story that drips with realism and fantasy at the same time. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is no different. The story is terrific, the characters are easily likeable or hated and you're always wondering what's next. Easily recommended if you like Neil Gaiman's work.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really like this form of Mahjong.  I have bought others<br />and I find this is just right for me.  Not to hard, but hard<br />enough to make me think.

1401324649|5.0|You'll love the characters...because that is what they are...Characters with a capital &#34;C&#34;.  The adventure weaves through 100 years of history that is authentic...and like Forrest Gump, the 100 Year Old Man insinuates himself into the thick of it!  Good read!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Just like the other cd. I got another for my neice for her brithday and she thinks that nobody would get her one. She is going to be surprise.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud throughout. As it moves on, the characters stories weave together and it becomes sad and heartwarming and hopeful. Wonderful and highly recommended.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is available at Best Buy and Google Play for $35.00.Chromecast is extremely easy to setup. Why is it so expensive on Amazon??<br /><br />[...]
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book lays out the idea of introverts in such a way that even the most extroverted person can understand.  It should by all rights be required reading in schools.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Too bad this movie was promoted mainly to teens.  It deserves a much larger audience.  Most adults will like it as much as I did.  I liked it so much when I saw it in the theater, I bought the DVD so I could share it with others.  Besides enjoying the story and the performances again on DVD, I also watched it with both commentaries.  The one by the writer/director is a work of art in itself.<br />The one with him and two of the stars is fun.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Gaiman's most well-known novel doesn't disappoint, no matter how many times you read it.  There is always something you missed, something that flew under the radar the first time you read through.  It's long, but worth every word.
B005LAIISA|5.0|my two-year old daughter just loves these Ice Age movies and the latest sequel has all the fun and adventure as the first.  I think they get better and better with each sequel and so far this seems to be her favorite.....I hope they keep making these!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Normal zombie books and movies are normally crap. This one is not normal. I loved the way Max pulled off interviews that all tied together.
B005LAII4E|5.0|This was so much better than the first one! I understand why some people are quick to poke fun of these GI Joe movies but we have to remember these are based on a toy line and cartoon, but the translation to major motion picture was all I could expect and hope for....I didn't get to see this in the theaters but I'm so glad I bought it on DVD and I've watched it several times already.  Lots of cool characters and vehicles that make up the GI Joe/Cobra world and plenty of action.  Not nearly as bad as some reviewers would make you believe
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. it keeps your mind sharp. good brain teaser. would definitely recommend this game to others.
B00D5YNQMW|2.0|...yesterday. Very disappointed by this release. One of the main reasons I picked it up was because I was impressed by the fact that the band went to Japan after the events the country went through. This doesn't mean I want to see it during the concert at the expense of a few songs. Worst of all, they cut off \\"Train Kept A Rollin'\\"!!! This will probably end up being sold back to a store for a few bucks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game my mom plays it and so does my dad they just love it so much
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I liked it just as well as the first and usually I dislike the 2nd in most series but I adored this one! It was nice to see the decision-making going through America's mind~even if I didn't like some of her logic of making a decision between Maxon and Aspen! :( But otherwise it was AAAHHHMMAAZZZING!!!!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I really enjoyed the game until level 21 when the last rune would not work, the one that looks like a square p. The challenges were fun although some of the hints were a little confusing. I just wish I was able to finish it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Decent adaptation of the book. Love Woody Harrelson ! The movie is well paced,looking forward to the next two movies!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I read this book while travelling.  It was just the book to read on a long plane flight, very entertaining.  I couldn't stop chuckling out loud.  It wasn't only the humour that was appealing; I loved the warmth of the relationships and the development of understanding of the main character.  I have recommended this to others and I have bought a copy as a gift for a friend.
B008WOULPK|5.0|Loved all the inside information on fashion's biggest and brightest from THE creative director herself. Loved it. Grace is modest and at once, so likable. I'd like to have lunch with her someday.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is so touching! I shed tears.  Another book to recommend.  A tale of courage, perseverance and understanding, of looking beyond the everyday routines that mask real emotion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! And my 3 year old loves it too. If you live the minions then get this game!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Pretty good movie, funny, a little gore, profanity, everything you can look for in a movie. It is not for kids under 18. Unless you allow them to watch whatever they'd like.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game that is fun with the minions AND ITS FREE!!! nothing like a great game thats free
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Intricate and beautifully written. I can't wait for the next book to come out! When will Daenarys come to Westeros???
0786958731|5.0|My son got our family involved in playing The Wrath of Ashardalon, hence the reason we purchased this game.  Very pleased with both the gameplay as well as the production quality of the board tiles, figures and cards.  If you're tired of playing the competitive (and repetitive} games like Monopoly, Life, Clue, etc., I highly recommend a co-op game such as this.  Well worth the investment.  We've had hours of enjoyable family time trudging through the dungeons.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I love the story plot and the characters.  Don't like all the cussing (seemed like it got worse later on in the season.)  I know it is real life, but a little too in you face for me.  TV programming has sure changed in my lifetime (which is getting considerable).  The storyline is intriguing.  I have worked in a law office, and it is true there are a lot of plots and subplots, and a Defense firm sure does mandate and love lots of billing hours!  Very true to life; although I don't remember so many #!&$'s.  However, I did not work in NYC.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Upstairs Downstairs, seasons 1 and 2 HD should never have neen cancelled.  I loved it as much as or more than Downton Abbey.  The cast is great, I also loved the cinematography and the story lines.<br /><br />I tried watching the episodes from the 70s but was not as entertained.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Highly recommended book. Likeable really walks you through how to improve your social media content, it doesn't simply provide buzz words but is peppered with relevant examples throughout the book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very interesting story line. As always Grisham keeps you guessing until the end.. You actually like the characters even though they are criminals. All-in-all a fine and satisfying read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found it entertaining and I was very supprised by the end. I would recommend this to my family and friends.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Game plays well, but every deal with the free game you are hit with an advertisement. I don't need this type of pushing. I will pay for the game from now on.
B003JSSPSY|1.0|I enjoyed the first season of the Legend of the Seeker. This second season I could only watch the first episode- it is too dark and evil in intent. The DVD ended up in the garbage.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|not easy not hard but keeps the brain working and a general entertainment. many have tried it on my tab and have added it to theirs but sometimes the talking is a little to much.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I have bought all of the Glee music.  All records are great to listen too and I especially liked all of their Christmas albums.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I love this book. Easy to follow programme. It has changed my life! Definitely a winner!  Try it for success!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I purchased both book and DVD and have found it was much better than I had expected.  Well worth the purchase of both and reading as well as watching the movie.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is a great app. It has many challenging levels, fun bosses, some cleverly placed movie references, and great cartoon style graphics. Worth the buy!
B000002OZY|5.0|I have owned this before and Love it very much, I bought this used and found it plays very good no problems have I found yet.
0061998885|4.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this book.<br /><br />Spoilers.<br /><br />Lehane can get the tone just right sometimes - that mix of humour with hardboiled mean streets. Much of this novel tools along very nicely, with able wisecracking dialogue greasing dangerous scenes we'd hate to experience any way but vicariously (although the constant exchange of banter/threats/put-downs does mean the voices are all rather similar - cops, P.I.'s, villains...). You could complain that the intensity of the breakup at the end of [[ASIN:B000JMKNVA Gone, Baby, Gone]] means that Angie and Patrick's reunion is a bit easy and low-key, but I reckon it actually fits this way. They know each other so well, they have so much history, I don't think there's a need to linger on some tortured emotional dialogue, and the understatement and near inevitability of the reconciliation works with the series arc and their relationship. And I'll grant Lehane the fun predictability he has with, yet again, interrupting the climactic kiss at the last moment, a deliberate reference to a thousand movies and [[ASIN:0062049100 A Drink Before the War]].<br /><br />The unapologetic glorification of vigilantism is a bit hard to take: here violence simply *is* the answer, and guns are merely cool. I mean there's room to explore this - you can make an argument that some people can't be dealt with in any other way - but Lehane doesn't allow much doubt in his heroes, so Bubba is painted as a loveable, eccentric, loyal, honourable badass - and the following exchange is meant to be lightly humourous:<br />Bubba said: \\"So this guy in the house, he did something heinous?\\"<br />\\"Yeah, I think so.\\"<br />Bubba reached under his trench coat, pulled out a .22 and screwed on a silencer. \\"So, okay. Let's go.\\"<br />\\"What?\\"<br />He looked at me. \\"Let's just kick in the door and shoot him.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />He shrugged. \\"You said he did something heinous. So, okay, let's shoot him. Come on. It'll be fun.\\"<br />Sure Bubba is a bit of a cartoon character, but he is given a lot more weight, positive weight, than this. And if you find yourself chuckling along with this sort of dialogue - where the due process of capital punishment is, \\"Yeah, I think so,\\" with that sense of justice cutting through all the red-tape, there is something a bit pernicious at play. These are the good guys, and they are too much like the bad guys without that being seen as a problem (nothing like, say, the moral ambiguity of `The Shield'). It was better, for example, when in popular media torture was seen as something only used by evil people - even during war you could actually have such a thing as `war-crimes'. I'm disturbed at how torture has become a mainstream heroic technique. I liked a line from `Dave's' amazon review saying that we like these characters, \\"...because an adolescent, nihilistic chamber of your mind responds to them...\\". So much of this is about macho BS, everyone continually having to show how they are the bigger man, with seemingly no awareness that this method of comparison is actually belittles everyone who's playing.<br /><br />Taking deliberate fiction too seriously? Perhaps, but the Kenzie/Gennaro series - think of the immediately preceding book - does claim some realism alongside the over-the-top bits. It's up to the reader to keep his head and realise what passes for heroism in this fantasy world wouldn't always pass muster in the real one.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but then groaned and rolled my eyes when it looked like it was about to descend into the same disappointing mess as Darkness Take My Hand. Please, spare me from yet another omnipotent, omniscient villain. Ugh. I (somehow - never explained except that, ahem, he's a super-villain - he's given some mega-profile, well, both of them are, \\"He was a child prodigy chess champ,\\" \\"He was in military psych ops.\\") know everything about everybody. I know where you are right now. And I'm a ninja.And I'm not going to just kill you (Batman/Mr. Bond), that would be too easy.<br /><br />My rants about this are a [[ASIN:B009JQFJVG recurring theme]], I should probably make a page summarising my whining.<br /><br />But, thank goodness, we only get a couple of chapters of this before (phew) some chinks appear in the amour, and you could even say the super-villain tag is a persona erected by the baddie/s to terrify and destabilise victims/opponents (whereas normally it's unchallenged, least of all by the author). We get just a little more credibility (a little, but enough) back in plot, and no longer is the baddie essentially teleporting around the place. Still, this is an enduring weakness in Lehane, not trusting himself to be able to make an engaging story without granting godlike properties to villains.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the twist at the end: if Kenzie's worked it all out, and he's such a smart player (although kudos to Lehane for letting him be surprised a couple of times through overconfidence), I see no reason for him revealing this to an enemy who is supposed to be preternaturally cunning and ruthless - why tip him off and show your hand? Well, why, apart from having a twist in the tail, but I reckon this would work much better as, say, a conversation he quietly has with Gennaro when she asks why he hasn't stuck this case into the `closed' file, and he quietly explains why he'll revisit it once the parents are dead.<br /><br />Still, apart from that dip in the middle Lehane has created another enjoyable ride, and is again a cut above a lot in this genre.And I'm not going to just kill you (Batman/Mr. Bond), that would be too easy.<br /><br />My rants about this are a [[ASIN:B009JQFJVG recurring theme]], I should probably make a page summarising my whining.<br /><br />But, thank goodness, we only get a couple of chapters of this before (phew) some chinks appear in the amour, and you could even say the super-villain tag is a persona erected by the baddie/s to terrify and destabilise victims/opponents (whereas normally it's unchallenged, least of all by the author).

B002R27J1W|5.0|I saw this when it came out.  I like Hepburn movies anyway, but this one still gives me shivers. Great story
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first Fifty Shades Of Grey I couldn't wait to read the second and third one.  The series turned out to be fun and enjoyable to read.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|This is one of those movies that I have watched so many times already that I can put it on & know what is going on just by listening. Hepburn wants to be a nun that works in the congo all the while struggling with the rules of the convent. Even though I thoroughly enjoy a good B/W movie this film in color is still a wonderful story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A friend gave me the idea to read this series and at first after reading the first book I really looked forward for the last two.  This was very good reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series kept me hooked since the start the unexpected twists and turns will keep you reading until the last page
B001DWXUWY|5.0|They just have a great upbeat sound with somewhat unique vocals that sound a little Springsteenish!  I look forward to future albums!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|It's Marvel, of course It's going to be great. It could have been a tab bit longer but thats the only flaw.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I've watched a lot of horror movies but this is possibly the creepiest one I've seen. After watching this movie your going to be waking up to the smallest sounds you hear in the middle of the night
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It keeps me very busy. All of my children enjoy playing the game especially when I'm working and need them to be quiet.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Its all 4 Indiana Jones movies! What is not to like? Honestly, this collection is up there in quality with my Alien and Terminator Blu-Ray collections.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This makes watching youtube on your tv a piece of cake.  As soon as I'm casting youtube on my phone or tablet, Chromecast can even change the input on my tv to view it.  It's that easy once it's set up.  Aside from Netflix, I'm able to watch documentaries and many other programs on youtube.  And if you can play something on your chrome browser, you can cast it on your tv as well.  Such ease and joy to use.  For $35, you have to be a moron to give this thing less than 5 stars.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I understand the appeal of this game, but it looses my attention shortly after I start playing it. There just isn't enough variety, and it requires too much precision for using it in a car or on any bumpy ride.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|This was a difficult book to put down - great story.  This is a must for all runners.  I would think others would enjoy it as well.
193700788X|3.0|The book was okay.  I have been following the series since the first book was published and was disappointed that this was the best ending she could think of.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|always say that there is a problem and it must &quot;force close&quot;. I don't know how people rate it to high when using a kindle
0425252868|5.0|Love this book.  I am interested in WWII, but usually don't read war or historical books.  However, I bought it because I heard an interview on NPR.  Really gave you a unique perspective on the war and viewed it from both sides equally.  If you only read one book on WWII, make sure it is this book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love it but when I try to get on friends it won't let me but for the most part I love it
B00003CXC7|5.0|Excellent!Excellent!Excellent!Excellent!<br />Excellent!Excellent!Excellent!Excellent! This was an EXCELLENT DVD of Alfred Hitchcock Rear Window!<br />  I LOVE ALL of the Alfred Hitchcock  Collector's Edition. I LOVE ALL of THEM!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Let me start off by saying I'd recommend d this book reverting  I know, for I've seen the movie, an  it's my second favourite movie to date, so I decided I'd read the book that it began with. That being said, I loved the wit and humour  outlines an  displayed ingeniously an  this is truly a wonderful read for anyone
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Exciting and Action Filled! Would definitely watch this series again. Couldn't wait to  watch the next season and so on!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun little game.  It's not too hard but still challenging.  Certainly one of the better games.  My kids also love it.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|A must see for Spartacus fans!!! Only 6 episodes but very powerful! I could watch this over and over again!
B0054LJGWS|1.0|Good Omens is laugh-out-loud funny. And you won't be gobbling empty fantasy candy-calories: there's a lot here for your brain to chew on. Sadly, the \\"good bits\\"  -- the footnotes, which are integral to the story -- are AWOL from the Kindle edition. Also, the Kindle \\"X-ray\\" feature didn't work; it would have been helpful, given the heavenly (earthly and otherly) host of hundreds.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: Skip the Kindle edition, and buy yourself a TANGIBLE copy of Good Omens. Chances are, you'll drop it in the tub or slop oatmeal on it at the breakfast table while you're devouring this hilarious tale of Armageddon. (And how could you ever duct-tape pages in a Kindle?)
B001NAT05W|1.0|One of the few movies I could not even finish it was so bad. Terrible story + terrible acting = terrible movie. The only this worse is the XBOX game of this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game. I recommend it to all Despicable Me lovers. Great fun for all. Kid friendly and cool for adults too.
0062255657|3.0|I'm not sure how a book can be whimsically brilliant and abruptly formulaic at the same time, but that's kind of how I felt after reading this in a 3-4 hour session. It is a shorter book than what I have come to know and love from Gaiman, and it's geared for a younger audience, so it may be unfair of me to 3 star it. But when you finish a book and don't give it any additional thought or have a sense of wonder/inspiration, I feel it's justified
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|superb writing, acting, photography, makes you ask if you would do what Walt did--@ least for the older episodes where he hasn't gone totally bonkers yet.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Just watch the movie or don't.  Rating a movie is funny since you may hate it with a passion, where as I may love it.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|all actors are top-notch, writing excellent--twists & turns all the time.  Think a writer or someone close to a writer has been diagnosed with cancer--all the scenes that discuss/show cancer are spot-on.  I was diagnosed w/ cancer April 2010.  Don't think I'd become Ms  Heisenberg but when you're dealing w/ cancer & want to help yr family after you're gone.....
B00821P6OY|4.0|I love \\"The Walking Dead\\". It's not the gore and the zombies so much as the character studies, The reflections of human /nature... The role of Baby Boomers and children ,the leaders and the sociopaths (not mutually exclusive) caught in the post apocalypse trying to get a toehold strong enough to recreate society. The hope of an (almost) clean slate. The way it takes cartoon characters out of a graphic novel and puts them into people I feel I am sharing my world with. This story is very similar, the characters pressed from the same mold. More gripping than Revolution , which feels flat and trite to me, this storyline is compelling enough to have me jumping to the next episode. It's a bit schlocky, the writers don't trust the audience enough to see the obvious and I hate that  what's  overtly clear to  the viewer (ie the harnessed kid traitor) is a fatal blindspot to otherwise immensely insightful characters.  All said it's still well worth watching.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Bonus- this is what I have been waiting for.  Excellent product.  I now have an app that reads aloud my PDF file.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Very similar to team fortress 2 on the PC! A lot of fun and doesn't suck to pay since there aren't any disgustingly amazing players at touchscreen so it doesn't feel like I'm getting my butt kicked all the time like on the computer
B009LMTDL0|3.0|The message is vital, but hard for me to sift through all the high powered corporate executives to hear. Probably a lot of the point though.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Another great Album cant wait for the rest  buy it and support music and good musicians while you can &#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is highly addicting and great for all ages, I love how they include parts from the movies and you can run with different minions. I would caution that you can buy items for the game so I would watch when little kids played. This is a great game and I highly recommend it for all ages.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|If you like Metal you will like this great vocals & musicians support metal and buy this you will like it
B007V9N5R8|5.0|I've always struggled to get my windows laptop to match my mac laptop. I've spent over an hr to fine tune it using the built-in controls but never gotten even close. After spending a few mins on this product, i've managed to match both laptops by an estimated accuracy of 95%!! the only color that was not 100% accurate to my eyes was \\"light red\\".<br /><br />The colorchecker passport was a welcome bonus.
140006922X|4.0|Really Good! I enjoyed it very much would read again. How about this book! It's great! WOW I dunno how else to explain it! I am in love with this!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie is a Classic.  I always stop to watch it whenever it is on Cable.  This is definitely one to have in your DVD library for years to come.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all Mary Higgins Clarks books, I love her writing. This book was good, hard to put down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is for all ages. And if you love horses or animals this is the game for you. It is easy, educational, and fun
141690977X|5.0|If you are thinking about breaking up with your boyfriend or that he isn't treating you right read this book! You will probably cry!
B007EDCWHA|4.0|Some girls are oh I like pause oh I like cookie dough desert this and that really do they if 1d is reading this I know  people who sing better then you she is a normal funny  quite a little
B002MFULQO|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie at least once, but I watch it more often. The stars who performed in this movie must have asked to play in the cinematic spell-binding account of John Fitzgerald Kennedy's assassination.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this book as much as I loved city of bones (Only I read this one faster.)  Of you read city of bones and didn't like it, give Cassandra Clare another shot. This book will blow your mind  with lots of action and just enough romance and drama.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This past summer I was with my cousins and started to talk about the TV show Castle with Nathan Fillion. They proceed to tell me about another Nathan Fillion show called Firefly that is to die for. After watching the first episode we devote the next hours of our lives to watching over half of the episodes! This is so well written and cast that I can't see why it only survived one season!!!! And if you don't buy this Blu-ray after reading this..... there just may be something wrong with you!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game might be great only it took way too long to load. Every time I advanced to the next level it had to load again and it took forever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and awesome I love to play this game the whole time! Anyway this game is pefect for me to play and my cousin has a highest score but I kept improving and wow it so awesome.Thanks for the game.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I really liked this game, but towards the final levels it got to be really hard. I would say this game is addicting but also was frustrating when I couldn't figure out the levels.
140006922X|4.0|Thoroughly readable, extremely interesting book about Jesus from a historical perspective, uncolored by various interpretations in faith-based books.  Dr. Aslan does a good job of presenting the material respectfully.  I learned a great deal and am glad to have had the opportunity to read it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive I played it all in one night. It gets your mind working but it's not incredibly hard. It's actually really easy except for a few levels.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|it was fun & entertaining.  The PC graphics were well done, in my opinion.  We all liked it, glad I only paid $3.99, instead of dishing out the $22 to see it at the theater!  It was good, but not THAT good!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I really like these types of games, it fun but I don't like how there's so much talking. I know you can skip it but some parts are important. Highly addictive
B00BZODDYU|4.0|This movie was scary & very well directed in my opinion. The situations, characters, & settings under the director made it scary.
B0054SMID0|5.0|this movie was quite entertaining.  the good story line - it kept you engaged.  acting was good.  good twists and turns.  all around good movie.  recommended.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Love love love this game. Great for 2 people or more. Super fun.  Just do not lose any of the pieces!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|As usual, I'm never let down. Loved this one as much as all the rest. Can't write fast enough for me!!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|It is smart and funny and well written, I liked it a lot. I need seven more words to make this a legit review.
B0064MGU98|5.0|One of the best shows on tv!  Very well done!  Can't wait to catch up with season 2 through 4
159463176X|5.0|This is a great work masterfully told by a contemporary genius.  I was unfamiliar with Hoseini prior to reading And the Mountains Echoed.  this is an extraordinary book, emotionally moving, visual, with characters deftly devised and interwoven in a timeless tapestry.  There is no better story teller in our time.  This is a book that you won't want to put down and days after reading it, you will still be pondering its meaning.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I was looking for a way to navigate the web on Kindle Fire and this app is an easy way to jump into cyberspace.
1781162646|5.0|Great story and very suspensful! King did this one right and took me back to my junior high years. Great!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Well digested in the scenes and set down with as much modesty as cunning....You will have to go look for that quotation.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I can't figure out how he does it but it's a ball!! I gave it John F. Kennedy and he figured it out.
B00002SSKI|4.0|Great movie, great price. Shipped pretty quick.  I would recommend this movie to any girl out there that hasn't seen it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun and addicting its definately a time waster.  Its a game for people of all ages to play.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|First off I wanted to point out that the glasses in the picture are covered in a dead man's ashes and are not scratched or broken. I think they added the red for a dramatic effect, but the red color is not in the movie. I heard so many people talking about Bridges and &#34;The Dude&#34; that it peaked my interest and I bought the movie based on the reviews, knowing I would want to see it again. This is a great movie to watch with your friends or at weird holidays or anytime you want a funny friends movie. I imagine this has a cult following with weed smokers just because the story is like watching Alice in Wonderland, it's that weird.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|works great does all the things I have needed it to do.  would highly recommend to anyone doing complex math problems
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. It has so much obstacle and it is very easy to play. PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Love the way the book brought historical, geological, and scientific facts together so well, all while being extremely entertaining!  I have read several, if not all, of Mr. Rollins' books, and liked all of them, but this one rocks!
B00962UJ22|5.0|This is my least favorite album Anglagard has released, and it still merits 5 stars. That's how highly I rate this band, that even their worst outing ranks among the best of the best. If you are looking to purchase your first Anglagard album, I would suggest Hybris, followed by Epilog, but that is my personal bias. Even though I only speak 1 word of Swedish (I learned it so that I could say thank you when I met the band live at Nearfest), I miss lyrics being in the mix. Also, I was familiar with the live versions of 2 of the songs on this album, and preferred the live versions to the studio ones. But I am nit-picking. If you believe that albums such as Larks Tongues In Aspic, In The Court of the Crimson King, Close to the Edge, and Selling England by the Pound show the best of what the human race is capable of, you really owe it to yourself to check out Anglagard in whatever way you can. And you owe your support to any band that is willing to take the time and effort to produce such music.
0547884591|5.0|First, I want make it clear, - I do not care about cooking that much at all, but I still bought this book in a hard cover.<br /><br />To anyone who is not absolutely overjoyed with it - I am afraid you missed a point! It is not your mama's cook book distilled into 4 hours effort. It is not about learning to cook few dishes decently and  telling difference between  chicken and hen. It is about way of living!!! It is about making your dreams come true.<br /><br />Think about this: there is a guy - smart but not kitchen savvy who took a challenge and took himself from 0 to cooking as an art form in 60 sec, so to speak. And shared his journey with the rest of us. This is the book not from a master chef perspective but from somebody who is getting there.<br /><br />Somebody here said: the author has too many references of celebrated chefs as he wants to dazzle us with his connections, - no, he tells you who he learned from. He went into trenches, spend his money and time, racked his brain, got behind the scene, put it all into words and presented to us for mere, currently $19.01 dollars for a hard cover.<br /><br />I am female and all I know is how to fry an egg. I lo-o-o-ve a great cooking, it takes me straight to heaven, but I never even dreamed of being able to get there. I did not buy this book because I want to learn to cook. I am not  domestic by any means, but I do want to expend my reality and go about it in a delicious way makes it all better.<br /><br />Today, \\"the 4 hour chef\\" is on my nightstand. It is my a \\"go to\\" book, I cannt have enough. Because of this book, - I really want to learn to cook now. It is fun, exiting and makes sky is your only limit.  Thank you, dearest Tim Ferris, for this \\"I believe I can fly\\" experience..<br /><br />Just in case you wander, no, I am not associated, directly or remotely,  with the author or any of his companies in any shape or form. Unfortunately. :)
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you like corny old westerns and blacksploitation films.  You will love this film. Yes it has the Tarantino standard of blood and violence.  But still a good film.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. The picture quality was excellent, and it looked good in miniature and on laptop full screen. The only problem was the sound quality. I had Amazon's sound turned all the way up and the sound on my laptop all the way up, and it was not really loud enough.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|For the math enthusiasts, this movie is a gem. For the rest, it might be interesting for the first 10 or so mins. of the showing. The film itself ins't bad, but the subject matter wasn't exciting to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a awesome game and its my favourite game on my kindle so far I play it every day
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Credibility of neurosurgeon helps make this believable . Interesting take on afterlife . Worth the read and wud recommend .
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a fantastic book, I would do that if I was in middle school, but out of all it a 10/5
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I am not a huge sci fi fan but there are enough other elements of family and interpersonal relationships to make this show worth watching even for a less than avid sci fi fan.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|AWESOME GAME!!!!!  I could play it for hours. Recommend it too everyone that.likes off roading. or four wheeling. great game.
B005LAII44|5.0|This is just as good as the other ones and may even be better. Of course when you have Bruce in the movie its hard not to be good.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|After 6 or 7 times using it it started to say vtube stopped working<br />Make it work in an update
B004XWLIJS|4.0|It's a remake of the original, 1972 movie.<br />It's a good remake with lots of fun killing scenes.<br />But it really needs more hot babes.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I know my husband will like the book if he can get it. I had to wait over 2 weeks for it,however it was worth it.<br />Robert Ludlum is a great writer.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|simple and nice but  a few confuse in the interface of items, the rest its fine mi son love this app
1575666286|5.0|Everyone should read this book especially Doctors and everyone in the AMA .  This could be saving lives.  Poor Diet and all the preservatives and chemicals in our food is what leads to disease.  This is an example of what can be done with diet, although Doctors will swear that things like cholesterol can not be changed with diet.  I beg to differ.
0345803507|5.0|this book came in such good condition, I don't think anyone had read it, it was brand new when you said it was used. I could not tell it was used.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very entertaining and suitable for all agesVery Fast, excellent Graphics, I recommend it to all... and all it, free.I really like it.
0345803493|5.0|I had to have the 3rd book after reading the first two, it was anew book when you said it was used. love it
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Couldn't get better, it one of the best ever in Music Videos...Pay whatever you need to get it!  Thanks, buds
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The graphics are great. I did not have any &quot;glitches&quot; or problems saving my progress. Very enjoyable.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|The writing makes everyday activities hilarious.  When it does decide to go into low-brow mode, even funnier!  I purchased this show because I love to gawk at Sofia Vergara, but also all the characters and actors are extremely solid at what they do for a living.  Thank you for an uplifting, light-hearted show!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The perspective of  a dog is amusing when you first start reading,,however  you  soon get drawn into  the family's  travails. It is a quick read...
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game of gamelofts has worked perfectly on my kindle fire.  unlike their game epic.  this game is free but you have the option of speed leveling with money.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this series and purchased both season one and two sets for myself and my daughter.  Have pre-purchased season 3 for both of us as well.
B004I744AS|5.0|If have this and the dictionary.com app on my kindle fire.  Often I am away from Internet access and I have still been able to find definitions thanks to this being offline.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|could not stop watching! I will definitely start reading the books!  Something my husband and I can both watch together!
B003L77GRO|3.0|After the amazing season 4, I had really high hopes for this season. This season was a huge disappointment. This season defiantly did have his high moments. But it had WAY more bad moments than good.
B005J9ZE5I|3.0|After watching the first Evil Dead, this movie was a letdown and was nowhere near as good as the first movie- which is a horror movie masterpiece. Nowhere near as scary as the first one and Evil Dead 2 is more like a comedy-horror.  Plenty of gore in this movie and not recommended for anyone under 17. A solid NC-17 rating for this movie.  Bruce Campbell's performance failed to match his performance in the first movie.  Evil Dead 2 is ok, but not as good as the first.  Evil Dead didn't need a sequel.  This was movie was not neccessary.
B00DXPC1U6|2.0|In my opinion, the first couple seasons of Dexter (with the exception of the third) were great. Starting at season 5, I started to notice that there has been a decline of quality. The sixth season was slightly better, but I hated the main killer. The seventh season got worse, and I basically lost hope in the series. Finally, after viewing  the first episode I finally thought the show got back on track. The episodes after that varied in my critical reaction, but overall it has been I pretty good season. I am writing this right after viewing the sixth episode, I have a good feeling the remainder of the series will stay good. [[UPDATE]] I just finally got to watching the finale, and I can say that the final couple episodes where just awful.. and the finale was just disgraceful to the show. Im changing my rating to 4 stars to 2 stars
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Well built and sturdy.  Could use more organizer-type features in small compartment for pens/pencils, stylus, business cards, etc.<br />Feels good when carrying, as the breathable foam construction provides a lumbar support feel.  Does not pull on shoulders.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a awesome game. It is so fun. I love love it. I play it almost everyday. You should try it is is fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L James is a gifted writer. This is the 2nd time I have read this and I was just as captivated as I was the 1st time. Christian and Ana have a bit of ever one or have bits of ever one in them. Lots of drama and intrigue, it makes for an interesting read. Might even read it again. Now on to book 3.
0385523394|5.0|[[ASIN:0882823760 Full Circle: A True Story of Murder, Lies, and Vindication]]<br /><br />Great that \\"Orange is the New Black\\" is getting a lot of attention.  I recommend it because it is interesting and we can learn something about prison life.  It is not gritty enough for women's higher security prisons, and especially not gritty enough to show life in men's prisons.  Of course, she was down for only a year. I would like to hear about her life and any struggles once she was released.  The formerly incarcerated are usually not accepted or trusted by those on the \\"outside\\".  Americans often don't believe in second chances or redemption.  Maybe she will write a sequel.<br /><br />For a true-story thriller try \\"Full Circle: A True Story of Murder, Lies, and Vindication\\" by Gloria Killian.  That book would make an excellent prison, justice movie.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|game is stuck in downloading.... does anyone know how to fix this problem?  I love the game and ive already unistalled and reinstaled and its still stuck :(
B009ZQFSRA|5.0|I was impressed with this movie, especially since I didn't know it existed. Reminds me of the Matrix, good action and good plot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie, then read the book.  Loved the book better.  Recommend it and can't wait to read the next one.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Installed this game on my Kindle Fire for my kids & they have been playing for weeks without issue.<br />Today when they tried to play, it states 'downloading' or 'loading' & stayed there for 10+ minutes without change.<br />WTH?<br />VERY disappointed.<br />Guess that's what to expect from a free game.  What a PITA.  I would rather pay for it & have something that works.<br />Thanks for the headache  &#62;=(
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|slow, boring and dull. the scenery is pretty but not enough to help the horrible acting and dragging plot. hate to say it because i like all the actors but it was bad.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable is made sturdier than many others I have purchased for less.  I am happy I ordered it.  It is well worth the price.
B00B81B0HC|1.0|I still dont understand why this band is popular. Their music isn't new or breaking boundaries its basically just taking over produced indie rock that is somewhat catchy but not at all brainy as it should be. The worst part is that the media is trying to shove it down our throats and only some of us are spitting it back out. What baffles me the most is how this gets famous yet other songs like \\"cut your hair\\" by pavement (older indie song that didnt get the attention that it should have) \\"san francisico\\" by the mowgli's  and \\"i love you\\" by said the whale are or were struggling to stay on the charts.[[ASIN:B00D746P0K San Francisco]] [[ASIN:B000S3NIUS Cut Your Hair]] [[ASIN:B00D611UL8 I Love You]]
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Probably one of the best design of the weather information.  Easy on the eyes and excellent design for the background.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it because it is like temple run it runs faster and faster you haft to jump roll and doge
B002NNA9N0|5.0|great cast and many, many memorable lines.  A must see for anyone in the sales business.  Alec Baldwin is despicable in his role.  AS is Spacey and Pacino.
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|A friend asked me if Have heard or know anything about this group..I did not, but after purchasing this CD have found anoter rock group that I can listen to over and over again...They tell stories with a very strong sense of musicality..
0375869026|5.0|After reading the book myself, I purchased it for my granddaughters 10th birthday. It should be on a mandatory reading list for everyone that reads.
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|The sound production and performances in all aspects with this performance are breathtaking..Norma is one of my favorite operas..This is exceptional and also the approach to the music is so beautiful and heartfelt...Bertolini Is always a wonderful performance and singer..I jove her...
034553056X|5.0|I always enjoy Grisham's latest.  It  is always so refreshing to read a really good story without all the t he<br />trashy and vulgar talk.  It is nice to pick up a book to read and know I will finish it!
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Great family movie fun for all ages every one will love it, entertaining, funny, cute, fun, like able colorful. Great
0770437400|5.0|For once, I wasn't bored in terror.<br /><br />'World war Z' is a real word observation of a globe gone Zombie, rather than a survival tale told in a mall among desperate strangers, Brooks has trailed out a web of global destruction through the very human insights of various people, post World War Z.<br /><br />While the basic description and all too familiar culling of the Zombies hasn't shifted from the genre, I felt that I had personally faced off against &#34;Zack&#34;after reading the book, pondering the scars as if I had survived.<br /><br />It has something for everyone, I've raved about it to friends and family alike - BUY THIS BOOK!
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Really nice story about elderly people. A good movie for all ages. Very entertaining and fun plot. Really good movie
B008HK3XYK|5.0|My partner loved it and it's the perfect color. It fits well, is durable and protect the small Kindle Fire HD. Thanks!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It's very intriguing so you HAVE to keep reading!! But at the same time it contains many unexpected twists and turns!! YOU SHOULD READ IT!!!!!!!
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|light fare....acting leaves something to be desired....but that is somewhat expected with the spider man woman...we watched it because the main actor is the same guy from Cloud Atlas....he was not as great here as he was there....directing directing directing.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This is a good book for anyone that grew up during the age of coin op games and the original atari system.
B00E193TM2|5.0|This album / cd is a MUST HAVE for your music collection !!! Plug in the headphones , crank it up , and gett ready to be blown away !!! Keep on Rockin' !!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|As long as you have patience the game is &quot; free&quot;  It's a fun free game and plays well. Enjoy the game
B0029O08WA|5.0|I didn't rate this one as highly as the others from Twilight but there are some cracking tracks on here despite this, especially Thom Yorke - here's a hint - buy the CDs (cheaper than buying individual MP3s), download all 5 Twilight soundtracks to your iTunes account, create a Twilight playlist then shuffle - hours of fantastic music! Result!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it  totally addicting for both myself and my daughter! It kills the battery though! I hope they add more to it in the future
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Great soundtrack with some epic tracks that you'll want to hit repeat for - excellent driving music and highly recommended
B00004YRQA|5.0|It worked perfectly and was just what I needed to save my game progress on. Thank you for good fast service.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Much better soundtrack than I expected - there's a lot more grunt and diversity than you might expect. Love it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series.  I don't know how she will end it, but I don't want it to ever end!!
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Fast delivery with a brand spanking new package ! All the disc play and I could be happier wasting my time or money on this product !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|absolutely love it!!!would highly recommend it to everyone.  easy to read, etc.great way to read the bible. very good price too!
1426209584|5.0|Spectacular photos! I have planned a trip to New Guinea just on the basis of this book.  I don't think I'll be climbing any trees at 73, but I will be looking for the Birds of Paradise.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I heard mixed reviews of this book. It does focus a lot on Ceresi and her paranoia but not as bad as others stated. It was easy to read and has me looking forward to the next book
B003G4W49C|5.0|An amazing journey from start to finish that explores humanity and offers interesting explanations for virtues and evils we wrestle with internally as individuals and as a race every day.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My daughter put this game on my Kindle & I started playing it and got addicted to it!<br />I enjoy choosing different plants to use different strategies each time.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great and powerful movie. I loved the acting and the whole story-line was just fantastic. Really makes you think about how people with huge emotional struggles have to live day to day. Loved it!
B00E1942VO|3.0|Im sorry if theres any children that are unable to buy the explicit version, but its absolutely needed to enjoy 5FDP... Trust me half the song is blank because they censor the curse words... If you want the album, buy the explicit version.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|It was beautiful to watch but the plot and the way the story developed was lacking. What I mean by lacking was, I saw many flaws in the plot development and may parts were not believable considering what happened in the movie and for sci-fi/fantasy buffs. I understand it is not supposed to be real, but there were just some parts ( I do not want to give away spoilers) that made me think &#34;that doesn't fit right.&#34;  It still is a beautiful movie and I adore the actors but I expected more.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Did he or didn't he?  This book will keep you on the edge of your seat.  You won't want to stop turning the pages.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I have no words to say how wonderful this was. I read the book when I was in high school and watched the original animated movie but this was just breathtaking! I was so pleased that they kept the singing in too. There is no Hobbit without songs! You gotta see this!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|The songs, the sound and just the vinyl made me go back to vinyl times. Its just perfect and sounds really well.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I thought for sure this was gonna be terrible but I have to say it was pretty good considering what it was. I love the actors, and the story was entertaining. I love the witty comedy they put into it, and the very unique and inventive weapons they created for the witch hunting. Pretty good flick!
B008M9PHWM|5.0|Totally met my expectations. The songs are more awesome than I expected. Thank you amazon for selling such an amazing item. First time I buy something and I just loved it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I was so skeptical to watch this movie, but I have to say I was not dissapointed. This was just a real winner to watch. It tied up a lot of loose ends in the original movie and helped viewers figure out where so many of our beloved characters came from including the cowardly lion, scarecrow, and tinman! I won't give away anything, but you really need to see this if you want the complete backstory to The Wizard of Oz.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Your eyes will be glued to the screen for hours non stop fun in the Dragon land so get ready
1587143879|5.0|I've studied for the A+ exam, and had some good material. I studied for and passed the Network+ exam, with still pretty good material. When I decided to buy this in order to prepare for CCNA, I was a bit skeptical. But since the old exam isn't even retired, yet, there aren't a lot of study materials for the new exam out there. So I bought this...and WOW! I wish this guy had developed material for network+. I have a terrible memory, but he puts things in a way that somehow makes retaining them far easier than any other study material I've ever used. He also has a whole study system that makes taking everything all in a breeze. I now understanding things fully that were vague to me when reading about them while studying network+, and I'm only on the second section of the first book. I couldn't be happier that I bought this, as I doubt there is anything now, or anything in the future that will top this, as far as independent study goes. If you're going to take the exam, you'll be doing yourself a favor by picking this up! I would pay a lot more for it, if I had to!
0385751532|5.0|I got this for summer reading and I was on a time crunch. The expected time for the book to come was in 4-20 more days. I received it earlier than expected. I also got this as used instead of new and it's in great condition. You can't even tell it's used. I totally recommend this seller!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is calming, relaxing, absorbing and compelling all in one. The graphics are beautiful and as a person who usually switches off the game music as soon as I start playing,I am enjoying the soundtrack. One of the best games I've downloaded. Wholeheartedly recommend this game and the other quell games too.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|I bought this for my three-year-old daughter to play with during our annual week-long lake vacation. She wanted to play with it on our very first day there and then played with it every single day after that. She did not have much trouble peeling the \\"stickers\\" off, and she loved changing the outfits on the girls. I agree with a previous poster about the gloves all being for the right hand. Seems like a design flaw, but not a big deal. The only con I would mention is that once all the stickers are peeled off, it becomes a little bit of a nightmare to keep them organized for re-use. But at this price, I think I might just order a couple more new ones for upcoming vacations. (We have the sticker book where you can decorate rooms in a house as well and this one was played with SO much more than that one.)
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Refreshing originality in this genre.  Deftly composed and thoughtfully written, exciting and retrospective.  I'm really looking forward to day three!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|It takes a while to figure out what to do and the hint button doesnt always help. I did find it very fun and enjoyed playing
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Awesome game! I'm only annoyed by a few glitches... and they're worth dealing with. A must have for anyone with a touchscreen!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is, in my opinion, an incredibly well-written and beautifully detailed book.  I have read it at least five times and find it to be as much fun now as the first time I read it.  Ms. Harkness has built the story line in finely etched layers and has not left any loose threads anywhere, as far as I can tell.  Each time I read it, I discover new elements that I had not noticed before, which is a pure joy.  I have read Shadow of Night, and cannot wait for her third and, I hope, not final book in this mesmerizing series.  I think this series has lots of potential for interesting future story lines.  I certainly hope Ms. Harkness remains dedicated to her craft as an exquisite author and tale-spinner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter and myself could not stop watching this series.  Can't wait for season 4.  Love it and recommend it highly!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You must buy it's so addicting if I could I could play it ALL DAY LONG!!!!!! Must buy!!!!!!!!! :) ;)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Could not stop watching, absolutely wonderful series, would recommend highly!!  You won't be disappointed! A combination of drama with a little comedy thrown in.  Maggie Smith is wonderful and are all of the cast members.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved the story line and the meaning behind the novel. Like nothing I've ever read! Really shows how leaders are made.
B000001FDK|4.0|Grease was (is) a fun, good movie.  The period music is wonderful and it is well performed.  I recommend it.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|Like no love story I've ever read. Describes such a magical place! I wish they made such a circus. I love how all the stories fit together.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I feel the same as everyone else. Not only was it loads of fun for the two hours or do I played, it's beautiful to look at too.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I dropped my Kindle after being so careful to put it  back in its case after each use.  After being dropped, my Kindle did not charge right; had to hold the cord at an angle with pressure.  Called Amazon and the rep diagnosed I needed a new USB cable.  I received it in a few days and my Kindle is now charging correctly. I have become quite dependent on my Kindle and am very happy this cable solved my problem.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|As soon as I got this awesomely fun game I played it all night the best detail is that it's absolutely FREE
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book made me cry, this book is just so fantastic . You have to experience this for yourself. A book full of love and civil war. A very good read. I love it! I read it over and over again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found this book to be incredibly intriguing and exciting, although it has certain parts were it is kind of slow phased, overall it does gets you to feel the enviroment of the weird reality and time where this story takes place
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|The Anker charges work as I expected them to based on the descriptions and other positive reviews. I like that they're a little hard to insert/remove from the 12v outlets in my truck as I don't have worries that they'll come loose and stop charging.<br /><br />We've been able to charge both an iPhone and an iPad at the same time as advertised. I was a little surprised when I plugged an iPhone into the iPad port and had it not charge, but that might have just been the USB cable I was using.<br /><br />All in all very happy with the chargers.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Love it and cannot wait for next. Long, but moves quickly. Characters are vivid and unique.  The end leaves me craving more.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|We love this game and highly recommend this to everyone with small children!!! Very educational and it keeps her mind going.
B008602KQI|4.0|This wasn't to bad to watch. Would watch again... Once again have to write to much of a description why
B00669MFA2|5.0|Having a family who read every Harry Potter novel when each was released, listened to the books on tape (at the time) during family vacations, anticipated every movie and relished midnight showings, this was a great representation of the final book.  As there may be some who have not seen the final chapter, no more details will be given here.  Enjoy the end to this epic series!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very good show! It was very entertaining, and the stars were handsome to boot! I'm glad that I took the time to watch I was a little hesitant at first but I liked both those actors so I decided to give the show a chance and I was not disappointed.
0385523394|5.0|I hadn't heard of this book until I watched the Netflix series. I'm glad I did. I purchased the book and couldn't put it down. Highly recommend!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I use this app with mainly google calendar, and the sync feature is useful. What's more is that I can choose which calendars I see offline. I can also edit while offline, and next time it connects to my network, it syncs. Within the app, I can toggle between my individual calendars, which can be custom color coded to match your ideal preference. I like that the in-app icons I add for events show up on my personal computer as well. Overall, integration with GoogleCal works fine.<br />The interface is attractive. You have many ways to view your events. Even when there's not a lot going on, this app can be used for reminders and such, although I usually check in every other day/everyday since this app has replaced my pencil and paper agenda.
B00004THAY|4.0|It's BB and he shines throughout.  Glad he does most of the singing.  Clapton is his usual self and he is wise enough to let BB take the lead in signing on most songs.
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|It is not possible to install the plugin in the typing options of my device as default. So I have to open it separately.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I was pleased to find this wasn't some feel-good financial self-help book, like the Rich Dad books. The content of this book is backed up with years of statistical data. I'm in the data business, so an accurate representation of data -- as opposed to vacuous sentiment about getting rich -- is a rewarding read. A lot of the content of this book hit me right between the eyes, and has shown me that I need to make some adjustments to my financial habits.<br /><br />Get the book...it's a great read.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I've been a Cohen devotee since1967. This performance with the Webb sisters et al tops everything this musical genius and prophet has ever done!
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Amazing...I thought I knew a lot about 'Scarface' until I read this book. It's more than a guide...more like a full book in its own right that tells the story of how a little, largely ignored movie from 1983 grew into one of the most famous movies of all time. Did you know...Pacino was 42 at the time...the two Cubans in the cast are the actors who play Chi Chi and Manny...the movie was Al Pacino's idea...a lot of the dialogue is from the 1932 film and that it was Sidney Lumet's idea to make the story contemporary and set it in Miami in the cocaine world?<br /><br />Also, the scenes at Sosa's house and Tony's mansion were filmed in luxury homes in Montecito. There's a LOT here. But my favorite part is the analysis of the actual movie. It was very interesting to learn how rich and detailed the movie is. 'Scarface' deserves a lot more critical love! Hopefully, this superb, stimulating book will be the first of many on what is one of many people's favorite films.<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B007K8QO28 UP THE \\"DOWN\\" LADDER]]
B009GI8J1O|5.0|This is a novel that had me thinking long after the last page was read. The story has many intertwining layers and asks the question &#34;Where are we, as a civilisation, heading? What re the consequences of our choices? Are these choices we really want to make?&#34;
B005G5PPGS|5.0|As a Bill James reader and fan it was fun to see his ideas play out in the movie.  Really enjoyed it.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|Sizes run a little bigger than normal
B009YMKL4A|5.0|After all the crappy x-men movies they finally got one right. Its just too bad all the previous installments probably tarnished everybody from wanting to even see this one.  Bryan Singer has taken a figurative dump on my childhood with his incarnation of X-men but I guess if there's any kind of redemption for the series it would be this installment.  Michael Fassbender & James Macovoy are way better versions than Patrick Stewart and Ian Mccellan could ever imagine to be. Yesss they are that good and who would of thought Kevin Bacon could be such a good villain.  Great screenplay, great actors, great movie
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I'm so happy I got the version of this book with the original cover. The book itself is amazing and impossible to summarize in this review. It's a very deep and thought provoking story. It really makes you think and brought tears to my eyes several times.<br /><br />Great seller too. It arrived quickly and with no damages! Recommended.
B006PAV1XO|3.0|Expected more from cast, story came out kind of slow and lame. Expected more of an adventure than a dull summer.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|This movie contains some of the most powerful and beautiful music I have heard in any movie so far.<br />Never have music been able to make me feel anger, sorrow, happiness, stress and fear within the same song. This soundtrack is filled with good tracks.
B000I8G5GW|4.0|Love war movies and if you do too, don't pass on this one. Good story, good acting, and great scenery, just wish some made it home.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hate the way it ended!!!!!!! So sad and irritating. Hopefully the books to come will fill in all about the crack whore
B00AYB16EO|4.0|Nothing like poking fun at all the popular horror movies that had came out. Wayans always do a great job of bringing the crazy and zany views that you may have imagined yourself. A no brainer, just relax and have a good time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and very addictive for my little sister and I. I can't stop playing.... =D everyone should get this game and best of all its FREE!!!!
B008XKSW7M|1.0|This movie was dull and predictable and the acting was cheesy. I couldn't even finish the movie which is rare for me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This and Bingo Blingo are my top two picks for bingo games on Kindle. You can play longer on this game then the other, both on or off Facebook. Right now on Blitz I am playing two seperate games, one connected to Facebook and the other as a guest. So if you run low on chips in one game, you can switch over and collect your daily chips in the other game. It does freeze up from time to time in the free tournament but it is the free game, annoying, and you lose power ups if you played them, but they are working on it.
B007N3GZ9C|4.0|My fine tuning therapist recommended this book to me. It is an amazing journey into the mind of a brain scientist that recovered completely in 10 years. Recommend for all stroke victims.
0316228583|3.0|This book made me miserable, but curiosity kept me reading what felt like hundreds and hundreds of pages.<br /><br />If Rowling's goal was to show the ugly horror of daily life in all classes, upper to lower, and especially emphasize the nightmarishness of the underclass, then this book's a great success. The descriptions of the drug-addled household and its precarious social support were horrifically, sadly realistic.<br /><br />The story was very well-written, although I agree with some of the other reviewers that it was hard to distinguish a few of the many characters. I found the kids most compelling and painfully sympathetic, but the adults were pitiful as well.<br /><br />In the end there were some characters showing growth, and a little bit of light peeked through the miserable black clouds. However, I finished it last night, and this morning when I woke up I thought, 'thank god I don't need to read THAT anymore.'
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer's plot is intricate and compelling enough to hold the interest of the reader without dragging or being too confusing. This series, written against a background of important historical events, is a &#34;must read&#34; for lovers of historical fiction.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Since there are so many cheap USB adapters out there, I really hesitated to spend a few extra bucks to get these.  After they arrived I was very glad that I did!  I have been using these now for about two weeks and they are the best chargers for our Android and Apple cell phones that I have ever owned.  I have a habit of buying cheap stuff, and so I have probably gone through about 2 dozen phone chargers in the last 2-3 years.  They work for awhile and then I through them away and buy a few more.  I don't think that will be my experience with these Anker devices.  The fit and finish is excellent and they really feel like quality stuff -- but the real confirmation is when you put them to use.  I have found that they easily charge our cell phones in less than half of the time that the factory and other cheap chargers take.  Especially helpful in the car when you are only taking a 20 minute drive someplace and your phone is dead.  With my existing (cheap) chargers I would maybe get a 5 or 6% charge, but with these Anker devices I can easily see a 30-40% charge in the same amount of time!  Very happy that I purchased these -- I won't be going back to the cheap junk!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love his sense of humor and short action packed chapters.  One of my favorite authors.  I highly recommend this book.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to the Piano Guys 1 and now 2.  The are very creative and take music and give it a spin.  Try listening to the album on Amazon, you will be surprised.  I love to listen to the music to relax and fall asleep.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|What can I say---five stars! Outstanding!! I love these guys and their music is outstanding! I would love to own all of their music.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|I have really enjoyed the Barbara Streisand Album called Duets.  She harmonized beautifully with each star with whom she sings.  Great songs, great singing, and great listening.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It works really well for my infant and toddlers...I would suggest it to anyone with little children. Or just when you need a little peace of mind it takes to a peaceful state of mind.
B00164GDD2|5.0|The new 4K release of Ghostbusters is simply the best it's ever looked. It's always had a bit of a washed out look but the colors here are more vibrant, the blacks are blacker and it retains the film grain that is so often complained of being scrubbed out in rerelease upgrades. If you have the previous version it's most likely fine to keep what you have, especially for the special features. The original special edition DVD has the coolest special feature that subsequent release all deleted, the \\"mst3k\\" style silhouette commentary track, so personally I've hung on to all the releases and box sets. If you have a big tv (ESPECIALLY if you're one of the lucky few with the new 4K tvs, as there are even richer colors and qualities only visible on those screen types to experience) and don't already own it, this 4K blu ray upgrade is kind of a must own. If you already own the blu ray and don't mind spending $10 around on an upgrade (even if you have a big tv but isn't 4K) it still is a nice experience if you're a fan of the movie.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I knew about the story of operation redwing before I read this book, but I did not know the details of Marcus Luttrell's survival in the Hindu Kush. An incredible story that is well written from start to finish.
0399246665|5.0|The quality of the books are good. Even my 8 month girl loves to flip the pages. They are very good playful books for parents and kids to learn basic knowledge (numbers, shapes, colors, words) together. Highly recommend this set.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|The action in this film makes you wonder just how far a government will go to protect the real truth. I only hope our servicemen and women don't forget that the average American person knows how difficult their job is to protect this great country.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love Downton Abbey - the writing, acting, filming and staging are all superior entertainment.  It's witty, good fun, terrible tragedy and great history all in one.  But we want the full episodes (not the shortened versions), and the freedom to watch them on Netflix/Hulu.  The corporate titans are making us pay over and above subscription by keeping season 3 off of Netflix/Hulu.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Awful. My expectations were pretty low going in, but it was even worse than I imagined. Just terrible writing. I thought I could read it anyway--you know, for the &#34;interesting&#34; stuff--but I just couldn't get through it. Painful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game easy to play and keeps you guessing. I can play all day and not get tired. I love it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|More of the great suspense as only Lee Child can do.  If you've read other Jack Reacher series you will love this one too.
B00C7JFIRC|3.0|The Blu-ray quality was good but the movies animation could have been better. Being a Disney film you would think the animation would be top rate. As far as the movie goes James Franco was not a great casting for Oz. I think Robin Williams would have been much better. But that would have change the whole dynamic of the movie. I really liked Mila Kunis though.I thought she did a great job.
B007BVMVDU|3.0|I like that it seems realistic, and the story line is very intriguing, However the amount of nudity is unnecessary, then when coupled with the violence it can become overly dark.  There are some realities in life that you don't have to see to know it's horrid.
B00EBBQXZ0|3.0|Scarface: The Ultimate Guide was pretty good and I found it to be very informative- fun to read. I've seen the movie a few times and I can still remember what the 80's were like- reading this book bought it all back. I didn't realize that Miami didn't want the film to be done there- being Cuban I can understand why. What I didn't understand about this book is why the scene by scene description- was this really necessary? Not sure I would recommend this book.
0425166805|4.0|This was not the first von Daniken book I had read.  I had read two others before this one - Odyssey and Gold (of the Gods).  I found the latter two to be more entertaining and full of traveling and adventure.  I especially found his calculations on the Greek cities and monuments in Odyssey of the Gods to be fascinating.  This book, however, spends much of its print on predictions about NASA and the space program.  It was surprisingly slim on actual ancient astronaut evidence.<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't judge the book by my own expectations for its content.  The content about the space program at least gives a good idea of what the expectations for the space program were at the time.  He is right about the German/Operation Paperclip involvement in NASA and other US agencies after the war.  Overall the latter half of the book is more of a glimpse into the general optimism of space exploration at the time.  We still haven't had an overt manned mission to Mars, nor have we returned to the Moon.<br /><br />This book has really been influential in the science fiction genre.  Space movies and TV series before the late 60s would be set in the future.  After this book comes out there are stories like 2001, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica that had space travel in a long distant past.  No longer was space travel just something \\"we\\" could do sometime in the future, but it could be something that has been happening for countless epochs before human memory began.  I know this book is not the first to introduce the concept, but it really helped popularize it in contemporary culture.<br /><br />Most importantly, the book and the ones that follow give another alternative to the Big Two - the vaporous mirages of religions which treat holy books as literal facts, and the cold and unforgiving harshness of earth-centric naturalism which treats such books as chemically-induced trips, fables, and delusion.  The idea that all high technology has to originate from man in a steady order of progression is the main thing that von Daniken is questioning in his books.  Most of the ancient astronaut theory is just reinterpretation of writings and artifacts we have had with us all along.  Daniken snatched the holy books away from the priests and monks in robes, and took the technology and science books from the scientists and inventors in lab coats, and pulled them together to see if they could complement each other.<br /><br />What if religion is just what comes from seeing high technology and being awestruck by it?  The questions and wonders of religion are just extensions of things man struggles to understand, like cargo cults or weather cults.  The technologies like those described in detail in many holy books may be the spark that got man obsessed about this stuff.  Later, as humanity started to develop its own gadgets and wonders, it started to look a lot like what was described in the sacred texts.  The only thing stopping people from seeing the obvious connection were their attachment to one dogma (= hangup) or another.  Iconoclasts like von Daniken may never be very popular in academic and clerical circles, but they help open people's eyes to the possibilities.<br /><br />Personally, Erich von Daniken kind of converted me to ancient astronaut theory.  I had been raised a Mormon, and had no qualms with life on other planets, or extra-terrestrial involvement in life on this one, but the way it is presented in the faith mystifies it almost to absurdity.  I had a longing for a nuts and bolts explanation of the actual mechanics of the seeding and terraforming of this earth, and some physical evidence that it happened.  Nothing in Darwinian biological science seemed inconsistent with what I had observed, but there seemed to be a missing component.  Daniken's work on ancient astronauts really helped put all the pieces together for me.  It has also led me to other authors like Zecharia Sitchen, Lloyd Pye and Michael Tsarion.  I think this book is certainly revolutionary in its impact.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed it - I felt that it was told from an honest standpoint and was in a similar vein to some other books on this subject.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|its a great puzzle game! It gets pretty challenging, but tons of fun! cute balls too! lol. I wish there were more levels honestly! Love this game!!

B009KS4XRO|1.0|BB loses collectible items, takes your coins and credits, has terribly high card prices with very small daily credits given, the payout is terrible
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout's ideas are not new, but they are presented in a fresh and breezy, easy-t9 -understand style that lifts your spirits and makes you want to try her experiments (which, by the way do work!) Read this book!
145212308X|4.0|i read this over and over with my daughter with the mask on tell the story about Anakin as a boy and how he became Vader
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Loved it!<br /><br />my favorite track is \\"Sail\\". I would recommentd this album to anyone because it is simply that awesome.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I enjoy the game very much but it is a little difficult.I can't wait to unlock new weapons and armor.
B000Q4RJWW|5.0|This movie is non stop action and shows that a movie can be clean and still be amazing without sex and drugs
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I think it would be great for my kindle I read all the views and saw the pictures it look like a good thing to have and this website can help me with my interent problems that I have and cant log in to face book or twitter or anything but this will work I hope it would like a good thing and think it be a great job
B008133MDK|5.0|Great acting and story line. Sherlock was vulnerable in this one. Is his goose cooked? Has he met his match and fallen hard for a dominatrix? Great twists and turns.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel. It is our Book Club selection. The author really understands teenage behavior and psychological and emotional functioning. The court scenes appear authentic too. I highly recommend it!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is the best. I like how it sort of continues the Percy Jackson series. It has the action and adventure, along with the magic. The Lost Hero just rocks!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a challenging game, but not impossible. Play it now! You will not regret it! A good way to gef through commercials.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think it's good because it helps that finger movement,<br />And it's fun. It's awesome. It's cool. It's just a really good game.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've had this book on my read list for a while and decided to read it a couple of days ago.  I wish I had read it long before now but the &#34;the car goes where the eyes go.&#34;  This book is on my favorites list and I will read again and again.  The author is brilliant:  Enzo's thoughts and messages poignant, it is a must read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|What a surprise! I loved the integration of the old photos with the story.  It made me wonder what stories my own photos could inspire.  A great read for teenagers and adults alike - something for everyone.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing this game and that it is  connected to my friends on Facebook. It is lot of fun.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Imaginative, funny, and a history lesson all in one! Made me want to find out more about famous places, events and people.  I wish history had been as fun at school.
B0035S996U|4.0|Watch this to see how much New York has changed. A classic. Dated but a lot of fun to watch.
B004OSPTSM|5.0|I've been a Jane Austen fan since first picking up paperback editions of her book 35 years ago, and of course I have them all in my Kindle, but I have wished for beautiful clothbound editions, and so I was really pleased when Penguin brought these to market.<br /><br />I bought the whole set and keep them on a small shelf in my living room. The quality is excellent, they are lovely, and they also make terrific gifts for that friend you've been meaning to introduce to Austen.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Again, another engaging read! The descriptions make you feel a part of the action. Excellent! The characters seem so real.
B004NELBPC|3.0|Love huffpost, but videos, slideshows, and even written content is hit or miss. C'mon, HP, design an app just for Kindles so we can get the whole huffpost experience.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I like the interaction between the two attorneys (Harvey and Mike).  And It's very easy to dislike Louis.  He's great!  In addition, I have worked as a legal secretary/paralegal and see what's real and what's not.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|There is a little something here for everyone. If your idea of Science Fiction is technology and CGI firefights this movie has it. If you want a hero with heart, as much as I don't like Tom Cruise's real persona, he delivers. If you are tired of psychological manipulation and lies, the plot celebrates the value of truth over a many layered deception. If you hate drones and the idea of mindless mechanized destruction you'll love it. If you love the Earth and believe in the triumph of love and the human spirit you will be uplifted (for a change). Tired of Zombies, senseless violence, and seeing the worst humanity has to offer? This is your film. Held my interest right to the end and that hasn't happened in a long long time.

0316113514|5.0|I have purchased 6 of these books so far.  I read it for the first time several years ago.  I always end up giving my copy away to folks working in the coaching and school program development areas.  There are many others available since this ground breaking work.  It is pretty amazing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am an avid reader and I was happy to know there are others who have the same obsession as I do.  I guess it is inborn. I have 4 Kindles and am charging one while reading another.  Yes, I do have a life.  I travel a great deal, but would give it all up to read.  So little time - so many books!!!!
B004XANKVO|5.0|Tons of space and so far it's pretty versatile. I've used it all summer as I've been between places. It fit all my stuff and made staying with family much easier.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|The teacher's aid was the one I reviewed first.  It was very helpful.  The book itself was excellent.  I had read it years ago and the reread was just as good and I understood it better with the aid.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Totally worth the 1.00 totally buy it<br />BUY It ASAP buy it right now no lie to right now plz
B001BZRUR4|5.0|This is a book chosen for summer reading for an entire high school.  I do understand why they chose it, but grade nine is totally different from grade 12 and some of the wording was inappropriate.  I then read The Book Thief by the same author and liked it much better.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Action-packed film with a couple of twists; kept a person's interest; machine vs. man with an escape hide away.  Would recommend this film to a friend.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this movie, and it has a great message. She likes the songs too! Very pleased!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I use OfficeSuite Pro and think it is a fine addition to my Kindle Fire HD. However with that said, I figured I would upgrade the standard font list and purchased this font package. Couldn't figure out how to open it or incorporate it into OfficeSuite. So far as I can see this is a 5 dollar rip-off.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|I am very upset. This a highly entertaining movie until they used our Lord's name (Jesus Christ) as a swear word. I stopped watching it at that point. There is no need to use His name in that manner in any movie. This movie was rated PG13. His name shouldn't have been used in that context.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game was really fun! Had a nice mix of &quot;mini games&quot;. This game made me think sometimes. I would definitely recommend this game. Only drawback was that it didn't last long enough!!
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Most of the songs are terrific, didn't like the first song and a couple more. Just loved &#34;I love you more then you know!&#34;
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great fun would been FIVE stars by me- but needs MORE levels!!!!!!!.hope lots more levels are added real soon. have fun with it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|great show keeps me wanting more! the plot is great and the comedy is great and alive! as I said great show!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it.... addictive fun app.. would recommend.. wish it had a chat option.. and you didn't have to pay each game you play
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i was knocked down by season one. and my interest remained high through season 2, I can hardly wait to experience Season 3
B003U4UOP4|5.0|I loved how it constantly changed and you could never guess what ws going to happen next. Like a good book, just wanted to keep on watching.
B002PJN59M|5.0|A fine retelling of the King Arthur legend, but it really lacks entire years of his life. But very artfully done. I've always liked this movie. With all the high tech special effects they can do nowdays this one stands up as a classic almost like Starwars as far as what they did with the technology of their day and set it to some really great music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We really enjoy Downton Abbey and the third season did not disappoint.  Can't wait to see the fourth season!  It is a great show!
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This is very inappropriate for kids to be reading!<br /><br />  I don't think this book is very appropriate for kids 1-10!!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Not sure why, but this has not been updated in years. I suspect it may be due to EA buying Popcap.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Everything fine! No problems with the product and the delivery.<br />The price was reasonable.<br />Hoping for the third season. rgds.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is soo fun to play I'm 12 and totally addicted to it! GET THIS GAME this is a real review you will love it! out of five stars I give it 20!
B009X2CRMK|5.0|The twists and turns of the plot keep you guessing.  You always know what the ending will be but you are so intrigued by the journey that you want to know how you are going to get there.  The characters are well drawn and all the loose ties pulled together elegantly.
B004LWZW88|5.0|All ok, excelent product, Blu-ray transfer is indeed spectacular, and only a few minor bouts of insignificant banding away from visual perfection
B00E193Y36|5.0|This cd kicks ass from start to finish.  I think it's their best album yet.  The production is excellent on the live tracks as well.  It's the overall best release of any band I have bought in over 2 years.  It's mellow, its heavy, its the entire package!  5fdp musically rule the world right now taking over where Pantera left off!!
B009O2XY12|4.0|I got this game and found it immediately addicting. The early levels are simple and straightforward. However as you advance, it becomes MUCH more challenging.<br /><br />Bad thing for me is that to advance past certain levels you need help from Facebook friends (and I hate getting or sending &#34;game requests&#34;) or pay to continue advancing. Once I get to a certain point, I'll stop because I don't want to have to keep paying to play a game that can be ENORMOUSLY frustrating.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Beautiful read of adventures and reflections. Every since her interview on Oprah I was really looking forward to reading her book.  Glad I did.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show soo much and season two has continued my love. I can't wait to watch season three.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Very entertaining game. Picked it up on the amazon free app of the day and wow its more than worth free!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|We Love it. Wish it made money faster but overall great graphics and play. Definitely recommend!! Fun for all ages.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Such a great kit. If you do regular work on iphones, androids, or many other electroncs pick this up! Good job guys/girls @ iFixit
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was floored by the bad health effects of modern genetically modified wheat as pointed out by Dr. Davis. Recently, I had packed my cabinet with what I thought were healthy whole grains, especially 100% whole wheat and I am dismayed at discovering it was not a good decision. I recognized in myself many of the side effects that Dr. Davis discussed in the book i.e. weight gain, need to eat every two to three hours, acid reflux, joint pain to name a few. I recommend anyone who is interested in improving their health to read this book. I certainly will be eliminating wheat from my diet going forward!
B00881VLCE|4.0|There aren't many puzzles in the free version but you can do them all several times with different numbers of pieces. Fun!
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Though this film was originally intended to be a prequel to the Alien films, it has a story of its own and in my opinion it really delivers. I'm glad that it had something to offer of its own instead of just being a direct prequel. Don't get me wrong, I like the Alien franchise but Prometheus delivers a good back story that connects aliens to humans and it reminds me a bit of human kind and it shows that although we are very different, we are still very much the same. Oh, plus it shows a the gorgeous Charlize Theron... That's nice too :)
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Really find vintage trouble a great record from start to finish. Motown meets the blues, man it's a record that I can really play over and over. Long time since I have found music that really inspires me.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I still have some skepticism.  He did not seem to connect to any of his relatives/friends who have passed on, and I would have expected that.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Fun and tricky little app. Requires some logic to figure out the correct order. A little on the short side (44 levels), but a nice diversion.
B004GYY714|5.0|The only way to go to get radio stations on the Kindle fire HD..Good options.Do not know of any other way to get radio stations on my Kindle. Its FREE.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really like this game its really cool and i would toatally recomend it. i rate this game as a 5 st*r game game its not that hard and its really fun. you should get this free app i think youll agree with me. Dont 4get to rate it!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie. Well written. So much more detail and background. Fast reading with a great story. Excellent
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love the game, super fun! Can't wait for more levels so I can keep playing. I love how you have to use your brain bug still have fun
B006RXQ0JO|5.0|This movie is a classic!  Great acting and directing from a phenomenal cast.  Awesome twists and turns throughout and a great Boston city feel.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|GOOD GAME,you should get this game it is fun and has good hints when needed.Keeps you going when you get stuck.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|The new limited edition Nilsson \\"The RCA Albums Collection\\" is a must have for any fan of this late great singer songwriter. It's one of the highest quality box sets ever produced. This is a limited edition import and there is no U.S. version so if you are considering buying it I suggest doing it soon before it sells out. The set comes with a high quality glossy 47 page booklet which details every track. Each cd is housed in a mini album cover which reproduces the artwork of the original album covers. If the original album had a gatefold cover it's been replicated here. Each disc sports the original vinyl album label. The first two being on the black RCA label<br />followed by several on the orange label and the later light brown label and then back to the late 70's black label variation. \\"Son Of Schmilsson\\" features an older style purple RCA label which differs from the fancy older style black RCA style label of the original vinyl. The remastering is beautiful on this set. Each track now has much more detail than on past cd's although the import cd's from a few years ago are still very close to the one's in the new box. All of the unreleased tracks are great to hear and in many cases you wonder why they never saw the light of day originally. Many of these albums are seeing cd release on a wide scale for the first time. Some saw release in Japan over the years but they were very expensive and hard to find. It's really nice to have all of Harry's later albums on cd. They didn't sell very well back in the day but that's no reflection on the quality of the music. All in all I rate this box set right up there with the Beatles stereo and mono sets both in packaging and musical content. Get this before it's gone. The price is very fair for a 17 cd set of this quality. Harry Nilsson was a musical genius and we will never see his like again. He raised hell like the devil but he had the voice of an angel.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun. It's kinda a challenge to beat people from on Facebook and your high score. Everybody should try this game. The kids would love this game.<br /><br />By:Stephanie
B002H0DX96|5.0|This is a must see movie for any baseball fan.  I rented it for my kids who both play baseball.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game has some very challenging parts. Thank goodness for hints or I would have never got through some parts.all in all a wonderful game too play.
B006G35EEC|4.0|The original is still the best.  Although, separating twins and not telling them about one another does seem cruel and unusual.
B00009YOQW|3.0|The drum seems to be very high quality. We purchased this for my son's second birthday, and he loves it. It plays different tones depending on where you hit the drum head.  It is also very nice looking, just like the picture. The drum stick only held up for a week with normal play, we don't let him hit anything other than the drum with it.  Today the rubber head of the stick broke off, taking part of the wood with it. It left very sharp pieces of wood and splinters sticking out. It was pretty dangerous and could have hurt my son's hand. I was watching when it happened, he was just hitting the drum with it. I really like the drum itself, now I have to find a replacement mallet for him to use with it. I was pretty disappointed it only lasted a week.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are a great team in this movie. Romantic comedy that you will have to have.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Clearly the best movie of all time.  I have to watch it at least once every couple of years.  Never gets old!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You will go bananas when you get this great app and it's free.Trust me you will love it so much
1476733953|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for the next and I think final installment. I wonder if this story will make it to the big screen?
B0049J2BSM|5.0|great movie, great price for 3 days rental, I would recommend this movie to all .... its one of our favorites
030758836X|3.0|The ending ruined the rest of the book. I just finished it and am actually a little angry about how ridiculous the last few chapters were. I guess the rest of the story was interesting but I would not recommend this book to anyone. Thankfully I barrowed my copy from a friend and did not wast any money on this.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  It was hard to follow and keep up with all the different characters, especially since names of people and places were very unusual for the average reader.  I finished it but cannot tell someone what the plot really is.
0192789864|5.0|very good read. love it so much I hated for it to end..  so sweet. I laughed and cried..  I loved it so much I couldn't help falling in love with the characters.. No wonder  it's a classic.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|DS9 is most definitely my favorite of the Star Trek series. That said, season 1 has its iffy moments (as does TOS and TNG), but the Q episode is brilliant.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have been anxious to read a novel this engrossing for a while.  It kept me interested because it involved not only the murder but also  the narrator's relationship with his wife and son as a result.
0062064304|5.0|Lately I've been avoiding \\"art of\\" books because they can get discouraging to look at sometimes.  As an aspiring concept artist this book has really opened my eyes to the importance of design and the patience required to take an initial idea and push it along the pipeline of development.  It was interesting to see how simple the alien designs started out as and see them go through a number of alterations in order to achieve the final, vivid, and complex looking creatures that were used in the movie.<br /><br />Great addition to any sci-fi fans.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I enjoyed it very much.  After all, Abrams and Spielberg together equals a recipe for success. I'd like to see them collaborate again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What I think of this game is that it is awesome so that is why my title is awesomeness. Have fun.
B0090SI582|3.0|First off, let me say that their isn't a bad X Men movie, that being said, I'm a little disappointed in this movie (because the first four were incredible, but it was better than X Men First Class). It has major differences than the comics which was disappointing considering that it was based on a specific storyline of the Wolverine character.<br /><br />In my opinion X-Men, X2, X Men the Last Stand, and X-Men Origins:Wolverine were all better movies but this is better X-men First Class.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert the unbreakable adamentium is convinently broken in this movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is very well done and was a blast to get through.  My 17 year old and I ended up trying to figure them out together (once I got stumped).  It's a great combo of everything.  It plays well.  I usually get to the end of apps and get rid of them, but I'll definitely keep this one downloaded, and I'm excited to to see the next level.
B008602KQI|3.0|Although this was a decent movie to watch, it sure didn't live up to the expectations the reviews set.  Obviously it's all fiction but even fiction can be realistic.  Some movies I'd watch over and over, some I'd watch a few times.  Maybe I missed something with this movie the first time through and one more viewing may change my opinion on it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Good game, great graphics.  What can I say it is a fun game to play and while away the time.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I like it but after a while you have to start buying all the stuff  or else you don't win. In my opinion.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|My daughter loved this game when we first loaded it, but it eventually stopped loading all together. If the bugs could be fixed, it would get more stars.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Normally I do not watch movies more than one time, this is an exception.  It should be a required movie for every adult, so we do not forget what our grandfathers & fathers went through. We all should remember & be reminded  of the horror of war. Even having seen it 3 times, I still cry.
1433537419|5.0|I love this Bible! It is a great resource and great quality. The commentary is what sets it apart. Well worth the cost!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is full of twists and turns! In could not have predicted the ending. It is dark, but very satisfying.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is hacking AWESOME to play with it was a good idea to make it<br />Ninja and I love my little girl who was not allowed to
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matilda was one of my favorite Roald Dahl books growing up and this movie does a great job brining the story to life. Entertaining and funny, this is a great family movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is heart-filling and will make you have different emotions. Pi is a strong boy with lots of courage. His strong spirit will make you happy. I am 10 years old and I liked this book even though it  is meant for grown-ups? I encourage everyone to read this
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very soft spoken and relaxing puzzle game, yet very engrossing. The music, the art, and the play style all come together nicely to make a puzzle game you can sit and quietly enjoy.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|So grateful this book was translated and added to the Kindle library.  Nesbo has not let me down with his first Harry Hole book.  I am not sorry that I had read all the others published---usually I do not like to read serial novels out of sequence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun to play.  Myself; my husband and my three year old son all love to play.  it would be nice to have a chance to earn more coins for free.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Cannot wait for the next season!!!! This is a very interesting take on the traditional fairy tales. Would highly recommend to others!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|There was a lot of dead time where I thought they could have done more with voiceovers.  The book is much better.
B0009KQOME|5.0|Got it for my PSP, and love being able to watch it on the go!  Love the movie, and watch it while on duty.
0345529057|5.0|still reading them and they are amazing, the books are better than the series but the show does justice as well
0679729895|5.0|Roald Dahl, in my opinion, is one of the greatest authors  of all time.  His books for children are well known, but the huge amount of writing he produced in his lifetime for adults is often played down or overlooked entirely.  I'm never disappointed with his stories.  He was a true creative genius with the written word.
B008Y72UN6|5.0|This was a great movie , picture quality was good . Had to buy it because we were going to see the Smurf's 2, so wanted to catch up on the first one, but was apprehensive of spending 10 dollars on the movie for buying it. It wasn't available for even rent (forget about free prime ) so grudgingly bought it, but was happily surprised to get a $10 coupon to see Smurf's 2 in theatre ! Turned out to be a good buy too.
0060523808|4.0|Below are key excerpts that I found particularly insightful in this book, detailing the turnaround that Louis Gerstner engineered at IBM in the 1990s:<br /><br />1- \\"Thus began a lifelong process of trying to build organizations that allows for hierarchy but at he same time bring people together for problem solving, regardless of where they are positioned within the organization.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"I went on to summarize my management philosophy and practice: I manage by principle, not procedure. The marketplace dictates everything we should do. I'm a big believer in quality, strong competitive strategies and plans, teamwork, payoff for performance, and ethical responsibility. I look for people who work to solve problems and help colleagues. I sack politicians. I am heavily involved in strategy; the rest is yours to implement. Just keep me informed in an informal way. Don't hide bad information--1 hate surprises. Don't try to blow things by me. Solve problems laterally; don't keep bringing them up the line. Move fast. If we make mistakes, let them be because we are too fast rather than too slow. Hierarchy means very little to me. Let's put together in meetings the people who can help solve a problem, regardless of position. Reduce committees and meetings to a minimum. No committee decision making. Let's have lots of candid, straightforward communications. I don't completely understand the technology. I'll need to learn it. but don't expect me to master it. The unit leaders must be the translators into business terms for me.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"After all the customer and employee and industry meetings, as well as weekend and air travel reflection, I was indeed ready to make four critical decisions: Keep the company together. Change our fundamental economic model. Reengineer how we did business. Sell underproductive assets in order to raise cash.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"I've had a lot of experience turning around troubled companies, and one of the first things I learned was that whatever hard or painful things you have to do, do them quickly and make sure everyone knows what you are doing and why.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"The sine qua non of any successful corporate transformation is public acknowledgment of the existence of a crisis. If e So there must be a crisis, and it is the job of the CEO to define and communicate that crisis, its magnitude, its severity, and its impact. Just as important, the CEO must also be able to communicate how to end the crisis--the new strategy, the new company model, the new culture. All of this takes enormous commitment from the CEO to communicate, communicate, and communicate some more.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"What drives IBM's unique complexity is twofold. First, every institution and almost every individual is an actual or potential customer of IBM. In The second complexity factor is the rate and pace of the underlying technology.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"All of our efforts to save IBM--through right-sizing i and reengineering and creating strategy and boosting morale and all the rest--would have been for naught if, while we were hard at work on the other things, the IBM brand fell apart. I have always believed a successful company must have a customer/market*lace orientation and a strong marketing organization. That's why my second step in creating a global enterprise had to be to fix and focus IBM's marketing efforts.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"We made four major changes to our compensation system...This was all about pay for performance, not loyalty or tenure. It was all about differentiation: Differentiate our overall pay based on the marketplace; differentiate our increases based on individual performance and pay in the marketplace; differentiate our bonuses based business performance and individual contributions; and differentiate our stock-option awards based on the critical skills of the individual and our risk of loss to competition.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"I wanted IBMers to think and act like long-term shareholders to feel the pressure fromthe marketplace to deploy assets and forge strategies that create competitive advantage. The market, over time, represents a brutally honest evaluator of relative performance, and what I needed was a strong incentive for IBMers to look at their company from the outside in.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"The skills required in managing services processes are very different from those that drive successful product companies. We had no experience building a labor-based business inside an asset-intensive company. We were expert at managing factories and developing technologies. We understood cost of goods and inventory turns and manufacturing. But a human-intensive services business is entirely different. In services you don't make a product and then sell it. You sell a capability. You sell knowledge. You create it at the same time you deliver it. The business model is different. The economics are entirely different.\\"<br /><br />11- \\"My point is that all of the assets that the company needed to succeed were in place. But in every case--hardware, technology, software, even services--all of these capabilities were part of a business model that had fallen wildly out of step with marketplace realities...The implications of this kind of leap to a company's economic model can be devastating. In IBM's case it meant the collapse of gross profit margins and the attendant changes we had to engineer to lower our cost structure without compromising our effectiveness. Yet the hardest part of these decisions was neither the technological nor economic transformations required. It was changing the culture--the mindset and instincts of hundreds of thousands of people who had grown up in an undeniably successful company, but one that had tor decades been immune to normal competitive and economic forces. The challenge was making that workforce live, compete, and win in the real world. It was like taking a lion raised for all of its life in captivity and suddenly teaching it to survive in the jungle.\\"<br /><br />12- \\"You've probably found, as I have, that most companies say their cultures are about the same things--outstanding customer service. excellence, teamwork, shareholder value, responsible corporate behavior, and integrity. But, of course, these kinds of values don't necessarily translate into the same kind of behavior in all companies--how people actually go about their work, how they interact with one another, what motivates them. That's because, as with national cultures. most of the really important rules aren't written down anywhere.\\"<br /><br />13- \\"In comparison, changing the attitude and behavior of hundreds of thousands of people is very, very hard to accomplish. Business schools don't teach you how to do it. You can't lead the revolution from the splendid isolation of corporate headquarters. You can't simply give a couple of speeches or write a new credo for the company and declare that the new culture has taken hold. You can't mandate it, :an't engineer it. What you can do is create the conditions for transformation. You can provide incentives. You can define the marketplace realities and goals. But then you have to trust. In fact, in the end, management doesn't change culture. Management invites the workforce itself to change the culture.\\"<br /><br />14- \\"Thee work-a-day world of business isn't about fads or miracles. There are fundamentals that characterize successful enterprises anc successful executives. They are focused. They are superb at execution. They abound with personal leadership.\\"<br /><br />15- \\"At the end of the day a successful, focused enterprise is one that has developed a deep understanding of its customers' needs, its competitive environment, and its economic realities. This comprehensive analysis must then form the basis for specific strategies :hat are translated into day-to-day execution.\\"<br /><br />16- \\"Earlier in this section I mentioned that in every industry it is possible to identify the five or six key success factors that drive leadership performance. The best companies in an industry build processes that allow them to outperform their competitors vis-a-vis these success factors.\\"<br /><br />17- \\"This next generation of leaders--in both the public and private sectors--will have to expand its thinking around a set of economic, political, and social considerations.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Whew!!! this book is very interesting and intense at times. I LOVED the characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. The book reminds me of Bible time wars in the Colliseum. The battle is until someone dies. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|I like this season. Better than season two. I've already downloaded some music from season 1. Sorry to see it end.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Pretty good game but I wish it could have more options and on time too. Very catchy, I like it.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I really like Lost. It offers everything in a TV series. Its easy to get hooked. That I am. I'm already on season 4 and about to be done. Sometimes I watch two episodes at once. U will enjoy this show.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|We were required to read this book for ap English class, and while I define enjoy me exciting models, this was interesting! (Some parts more than others) it makes you really think, and the idea of having eternal youth corrupt us is new to me! I was in the same frame of mind as Dorian, excited and jealous of the eternal youth he had proclaimed but as I went along I discovered more about what myself and what I would have done. A few good twists, especially since I was so sure of what was going to happen. Haha it's recommend it, just hang on there! Because it does get better!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The end of the first book indicated this was to be a trio- now this book (which danced about)- says they'll be another. Okay...make another Ms. Day- but I will not be buying. I am now content. The h & h are together. They plan to marry. The bad guy who hurt her is dead (non of this is new- all of this is old). She works for one company, he owns another. They plan to move in together. I have my HEA. What else do I need? I have no intention of reading any more about these characters. This book did NOTHING. There was no date picked.. umm.. I can't even remember any super hot scenes.. wow. Maybe I should have done 2 stars...
B005LAII80|4.0|I bought this for two reasons: 1.  It was in 3D.  2.  It was $13 bucks.  I went in with relatively low expectations of the story, action or just about anything else to do with the film.  But I have to admit, I was pleasantly suprised.  There's no great acting to be found in here, nor are the action sequences over the top but you have to consider the script when making that call.  It takes place inside what's basically a giant apartment complex.  There's only 1 great action film that takes place in a building that I know of and Bruce Willis is nowhere to be found.  If you complain about the acting, consider the title character is supposed to be stoic and wooden, so I can't fault an actor for not going way out of character.  For 3D fans, I will say this isn't my favorite 3D movie but the effects that occur when the slo-mo drug is used is worth the price of the disc, especially the 200 story fall.  I wouldn't but this at $30, but at $13, I'm in.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This was a good book. I really enjoyed it. It keeped me reading at night. I didn't want to put it down.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie should be part of your 3D collection. First of all the 3d is one if not the best of all the movies out there transformer, tron, Pirates of the caribbean are not match to this movie. I own around 20 3d blurays and so far this is my favorite when it comes to 3d magic. When I got friends in my house this is the first movie I put on if I want to impressed with my 3d tv.
B00B8WXG9G|2.0|I think I expected more of Paul and not all Duets.  It was okay, but not something I would recommend.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|OK am so addicted to this game that I can't wait to get home from work just to play a round!
B00574P9EQ|5.0|This movie is amazing funny and good quality and history from the diary of Greg from the author jeef Kinney
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a great little game! I used peanuts before I realized you have buy peanuts with real money. So avoid using peanuts, there is lots of fun things to do without buying the peanuts.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the whole book in general. The book. The plot. The characters. Everything. I was scared you were going to end the book like an imperial infection and I panicked when I got to the end. I love this book. I really do.
1594136238|4.0|Good summer reading.The plot is interesting and the characters are believable. The ending is a little much but still a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is truly amazing from beginning to end I couldn't stop reading it I wish it didn't have to end :/
B00D78J7SI|5.0|I would not say it is their best album, but this is definitely another example of great metal from a great band
B0036EH3U2|4.0|the ending was not what I expected. It was twisty. A lot of Drama over sexed. At the end really not happy with Starbuck
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really liked the old app but the new one just does not hold up.  On the first page there is white on white so it can not be read and then there is all the advertising, games,  contests and surveys.  I just want the old one back!!<br />I will uninstall.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|We enjoyed the series thoroughly I  recommend  it to all my friends. good show, give it a try I think you will like it
B004L86718|5.0|I'm actually not a big Tom Cruise fan...I think he's a bit of an azz, but I love him in this film.  It's such a great story of a guy on top, being knocked down then clawing his way back up again.  So many great characters too!!
B004SBX112|5.0|Best Angry Birds so far, I really like the Halloween screens the best, but all the seasons are a lot of fun!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a young woman who has survived cancer, I was actually hesitant to read this. But it is a beautiful work and I cried both happy and sad tears more than once. My favourite thing that Augustus says, that rings true about this thing called life- whether you have cancer,have survived it, or have never had it is this. \\"You are going to live a good and long life, filled with great and terrible moments that you cannot even imagine yet!\\"Because whether you have had cancer or not, that could be the most beautiful thing a 17 year old has ever said. We all want it to be true. This story makes it thus. So happy I read this.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|excellent Had seen the 3 movies in the swedish versions and they were brilliant. The depth the book goes into is riveting
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg please get a copy now, the best read this year, the author certainly tantalised me with her out of this world writing, I felt everything, I wanted to be those characters.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this app was working great and I love love love this game but after the update it no longer works so I have to delete..........please fix the problem so I can download it and continue playing!!!!!!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Although this book is a young adult book, it is great for adult adults also. I believe if young teens read the book, it should be with adults available for discussion. Concepts presented are challenging for anyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|LIKE THE GAME...JUST AS THE MOVIE. PLAY ANY CHANCE I GET...WHEN I CONNECT TO THE GLOBAL CONNECT,I FEEL EVEN MORE IN THE GAME...WITH OTHERS...
1933952806|5.0|this would have to be one of the finest books i have read.there is so much info here that you'll never get through it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have seen this concert on TV several times and absolutely love it.  I purchased this for my daughter's birthday since she is also a Les Mis fan and she loves it too.  It will make you cry just as if you were seeing the play and Alfie Boe is absolutely amazing!
0060873175|1.0|I am half-way through this book and found myself repeatedly checking the cover to be sure that it is really Michael Crichton's name on the cover. To my dismay, this is more like the Rolex watch you bought in Hong Kong, that when you look closer, says \\"Rolek\\" instead of Rolex. Yes, I am aware that it was \\"shadow written\\" by another author. I should have learned my lesson with other attempts by book companies to keep flogging an established author's canon with \\"guest\\" authors. I'm sure Richard Preston is a nice man and fine author in his own right...BUT...this a task no one should have taken on. Michael Crichton could write a grocery shopping list that reads 10 times better than this \\"Saturday Morning Cartoons\\" meets \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Students\\" mash-up. Other reviewers have already thoroughly dissected the many, many wrongs perpetrated in Mr. Crichton's name. Avoid this tripe at all costs.
193700788X|4.0|I am glad I bought this book even though I've been losing interest over the past few.  It was nice to see things tied up even if it wasn't what I would have chosen.
1451695195|4.0|The book was interesting and easy to read and explored an area of interest to many people who have thought about life after.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I was turned to the Good Wife by a friend, so happy I watched... good story lines great cast good tension.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|It was an enjoyable movie but not particularly outstanding. It was interesting to see the life of aging retired musicians. I enjoy British movies whose actors seem to have so much more character than American actors.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have enjoyed watching the characters grow over the episodes. It has definitely kept me watching.  Harvey and Donna and the kid r my favorites.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Gone for Good was a very well written mystery, and kept my interest until the very end. There are many twists in the book, and things are never as they seem.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like it I love it I want smore of it so rate it like me it's a<br />good rate.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My daughter is a Dr. Who fan and is happy with this screwdriver, but says it will not open all locks. Lol
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I think it is a good game if you like this type of game. Lots of things to do. Nice assortment of things to build.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|The DVD came at the time promised by Amazon.com. The box was new and still wrapped just like I had asked. The DVD was unscratched and ran in great quality.<br /><br />I love this romantic comedy. Very cute and funny and you also don't know for sure who she's going to end up with at the end because they add a twist. Good flow to the movie.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Just like old times.  I should have bought this years ago.  What a trip.  A true classic.  Inspires me to make my own &#34;death-mobile&#34;.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I may not be using this device to it's fullest potential, but powering my AT2020 and into my PC I have 0 problems what so ever. I have never had complaints of my mic being low/fuzzy/muffled or any of that in game or on ventrilo or skype. I use it mainly for my gaming setup so I wouldn't know if this is the best for musical recordings. However for me it works excellent.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|love it...great app to fall a sleep to and wake up too... only good if you up grade though. so u can use ur music
B000002LFZ|5.0|I have loved this group since the early 1970s and this purchase is on my CD player right now. There pop/rock style spawned my hits and some of the most unusual albums of its age, but Fleetwood Mac is a purchase i will listen to for a long time, you should get this greatest hit CD also.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This add on brings the GoPro Hero3 to almost perfection. It allows to take better pictures and review them while you have no access to a computer or mobile devices. Only set back is that it consumes the camera batter much faster. However, additional battery is not expensive (less than US$20). Touch screen works quite well.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I love Bart Bonte games! He makes challenging and fun games for elementary school and middle school kids. The only reason I rated this game four stars is because some levels are very hard to pass. I would recommend playing this app along with sugar, sugar. I suggest this game for ages 8-13
B009KS4XRO|5.0|awesome game! I'm addicted. Ive had so much fun coming back day after day to collect my free credits to see how long I can play!
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever I recommend this app for everyone.I love so much I have it for my kindle the pc and my xbox 360.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Makes you aware of the people and their country. Weaves a good and sad story that I enjoyed reading. Good insight into the culture of the country and the suffering of the people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun addicting game. Every time the guard catches I want to play even more. It's fun and excitingly gets challenging over a period of time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a surprise this was for me! The perfect couple with the wife suddenly disappearing. You keep wondering when they will find the Body. A totally surprising end. I truly enjoyed  it , it was a page turner for me.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I have seen this movie at least once a year since the first time I watched it in 2005 and plan to see it again at Christmas this year.  It's just as touching and wonderful each time I see it; just a brilliant and sweet film.  The Bill Nighy scenes make it a favorite.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I use it to charge my Nexus 10 and it charges fast.<br />It's the only charger that works real fast and I bought<br />2 of them for at home and on the go. I would recommend<br />this to anybody...
1250029465|5.0|This engaging, very sweet memoir points out how easy it is to fall between the cracks. Trying to scramble out can get the best of us until the scramble itself becomes our only view of life. The life of scrambling is one I remember myself. Author Bowen's acknowledgement of the importance of having someone else to fill your thoughts and give you a reason to be responsible, is something that will never get old and never lose it's importance. Bob's story is the same as James' story. Both began they day they met. This is a must-read for anyone facing one of life's tougher challenges or anyone who wonders if love really has any place in the gritty, modern world. I'm grateful that Mr. Bowen's agent had the spark to suggest the rest of us might enjoy reading the tale. We do. Probably again and again.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I really like this because it has so many uses for it.<br /><br />It takes the stress out of holding it in your hand.<br />It is not that difficult to put on either....
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Yeezus is genius! As crazy as I think Kanye is, this concept CD has put him light years ahead in the RAP / HIP HOP game.  This is totally NOT commercial.  This is The Art of Noise on steroids.  If you like Daft Punk, The Art of Noise, Tricky, Alex Smoke, Orbital, NIN...you will probably understand this CD.  OMG!! The dog barking in \\"I'm In It\\" and there are no words for \\"Blood On The Leaves\\".  It's like the audio of a Jean-Michel Basquiat, Cy Twombly or a Jackson Pollock painting. This is Rap meets Kling Klang meets Industrial meets Noise.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|really like this band--nothing will  be as good as the second album!!  each album has been really good and moves in a differnt direction.  love the lead singer's voice!
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I enjoyed watching the original film via Amazon Prime.  I haven't been to see the new remake of this movie so i can't compare the old with the new.  I rarely watch a movie and was totally hooked on this one!  I would recommend to my friends.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I did see it at the theater but to have it at home is great!<br />I have a collection of Wizard of oz, so anything to do with Oz I am all about having it.<br />Not such a great movie for the grandkids, but great for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it and you will too. my kids love it and my wife love it they fight to play it. if you haven't watched the movies this make you want to see it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!  I love it!  My children and I love to play the hours away with these cute little guys!
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|After her album of covers, I never thought she would record again.  The album is very consistent in quality.  There are<br />no duds or tracks that I skip.  It's been mentioned before, but the producers were able to bring out a few new dimensions in her voice and her interpretation that I had never heard before.  I wish there were a couple of more songs<br />especially another uptempo track, but that is the only criticism have of this album.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|It just is not a very good movie. some of the visuals are great but the story is boring and the ending is worse still.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of the book.  The end of the book was thrown together. Overall, I would recommend the book
B009DCOU9S|5.0|My daughter and I love to play this. Great hidden object game with some extra puzzles for added fun. Lots of levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hi me here it is the best game ever it l loads really slow but u get over it after u play it ,it has so many levels my bff said but I'm still on level 1:)
B005UG542S|4.0|Was good but not as good as it could have been. I liked the whole series and would watch them all over again.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I went on a 3 month silent Vipassana retreat. In my journey I too found incredible insight and reading about the brain and the hemispheres really clarified a lot for me. Thank you Jill for your courage and generous heart!!
1452126607|5.0|Such a cute calendar.  Bought it for my daughter.  She loves this kitty!  The photographs are awesome.  Very happy with it!
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show was recommended by a few friends and it lived up to the praise that others had heaped upon it.<br /><br />Excellent scripts, and excellent acting.<br /><br />Can't really ask for more than that except to ask for more episodes!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie and love Tommy Lee Jones.  It had an interesting twist to it and kept me intrigued until the end.  I would rate it four stars but not a five star movie.  It would have been better if we knew a little more about the killer once the person was identified.  Even still, I love murder mysteries and was not clear on who it was until it was time.  So kudos to keeping us on our toes as intended.  I do recommend this one.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, it is much better than Kite Runner, not as good as One Thousand Splendid Suns
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Too much talking. Tasks were not clearly defined. Fun game overall. I got to the point where I really want to know who did it. I would have really liked it if Annie would stop volunteering to help everyone out and just find out who is the culprit.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|&#34;Suns&#34; was said to have ridden a tad on the coat tails of KiteRunner...But this, although his writing is always enjoyable, barely can hold on to the coat tails of Splendid Suns.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Fun, but too easy. I completed the game in two days. And I also got the laundry done, went to a dinner party, cleaned the barn....
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love these games that are challenging yet still doable. And the stories are always fun! Great graphics too! I'm ready for the next game!
B004V2S4SS|5.0|a very nice tv series that follows and completes the details of the characters in the end .well worth viewing
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Excellent! If you like puzzle games that make you think this is the one...nice variety of puzzles and just enought time if you're good at it. Highly recommended for those of us hungry for right brain challenges and not just finger gymnastics...
B0042UEU8M|5.0|In most movies, when someone special has died, I spend the entire movie hoping at the end, the person will be alive again. (I'm such a &#34;happily ever after&#34; movie type of person. lol  But for this movie, it was easy to just go along for the ride. And for people who have not seen this movie, I am NOT saying whether people do or do not come back to life. I'm just saying that wasn't on my mind for the entire movie. I really liked it. Zac Efron, is of course gorgeous as usual.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I could not put my kindle down! This book had me hooked from the start and was very cute and will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not only is this game great for kids, but the game is great for adults too.This game is addicting and draws attention to the one who plays it
0452257743|5.0|Excellent stories, I wanted to keep this set of short stories as two of them are my favorite SK novellas. It was harder to find this collection since the publisher now has made the four combined into individual books that you have to purchase separately. This seller shipped promptly and condition description was accurate!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome simple calculator. The numbers are big enough so I can see without my glasses. (I have really bad eyes). I love that I can touch the display area and see past calculation that I did. Overall this app is great.
0062511408|5.0|El autor posee una incre&iacute;ble imaginaci&oacute;n y sutileza para decirnos c&oacute;mo es que debemos trabajar para no solo so&ntilde;ar, sino so&ntilde;ar y lograr todo eso que--muy en fondo de nuestros corazones--deseamos ser, hacer y/o lograr.  Y a la misma vez, nos explica por qu&eacute; muchas veces nos damos por vencidos, sin tener una idea de que tan cerca est&aacute;bamos de nuestras metas.<br /><br />Las conexiones de la historia a como se desarrolla es tan llena de sorpresas, me fue muy dif&iacute;cil dejar de leerlo.  Recomiendo este libro para todas las edades. Ser&iacute;a ideal hacerlo parte de las lecturas obligatorias en nuestras escuelas primarias, secundarias, preparatorias, universidades, etc. Espero les ayude tanto o m&aacute;s de lo que me ayud&oacute; a m&iacute;.  Este libro confirm&oacute; muchos de los \\"presentimientos\\" que muchas veces descartamos como algo que no vale la pena ponerle atenci&oacute;n.

1476733953|5.0|Preface: I've read over 1000 books, short stories, novellas, etc, in my life, the majority of them \\"fantasy / science fiction\\". (Rest political / science (I have a BS in Biochemistry)<br /><br />The world described, the characters, the theme(s), the plot, all, very, very disturbing and thought provoking. Something about Wool really got to me. I had to put it down for awhile (months) before continuing.<br /><br />Worth every penny and you will not be disappointed.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|The premise is intriguing which is why I purchased the book in the first place, but I feel the premise was let down by the execution and the way the plot unravelled.  This may be more a personal preference than anything else, genre wise I just didn't like the twist it took (and I don't think the way the book is promoted lends itself well to the genre twist which was misleading).
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Loved this story can not the for book four the be out waiting patiently hopeful out soon. I love a good love story.
B00CL151G4|5.0|An excellent and solid start to a series! I love the new take on an old tale. Can't wait for the new season.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I would love to give this game an accurate rating, and am willing to change my score... but I can't play the game.  It is stuck on the \\"downloading\\"/ game tips screen. Have even tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Can anybody help me?  I love the minions and really want this game!!#<br /><br />APPENDED REVIEW...The game loaded today. Very cute!! Both my daughter and I really enjoy it.  It is a little frustrating, though, that you need coins for some things, which it appears you must buy with real money. Also the game is slightly choppy on my kindle, and sometimes the controls seem a bit off, but overall I am very happy. Would definitely recommend if u r a minion and temple run fan.y
B005L3HJ8M|5.0|This album is very colorful, cheerful, for anyone who wants to find a moment of happiness and relaxation.<br />Every time I listen to MX + HLH , I like it more and more.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is very fun for anyone of any age, it's a great time waster or even just if your bored.
B000YIWF4C|1.0|Dry, boring... Makes you want to throw the book across the floor. Any attempt to fully read this book is such a drag. Don't read this read some other book instead.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A few things about the game. It gives you a free trial to see if you think it's worth paying for. I think that's a nice idea. I'd rather play a game a little before buying it. They should advertise it as a \\"free trial\\" though. If there were no hint button you'd never make it through the game. The piano puzzle was the only one I had to skip. It just wouldn't work correctly so I had to use the skip button. All in all it was a good game. My co-worker and I played it together. She really likes the hidden pictures part of the game and between the two of us we get them done quickly. Thanks for the help Barb.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a book as wonderfully captivating as this. When I was not reading it, I kept wondering what could possibly happen next? I would recommend this book to anyone. When it comes to crafting an amazing tale, Gaiman is simply one of the best.
B0000696I1|5.0|I was so excited when my son started to take an interest in the TMNT. this was my childhood favorite!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It takes really long to load, but it sure us fun.  Heaven's seen the 2nd film and there is stuff in the game from that
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Challenging. Very hard to put down. It makes you think how it could happen in real life. It can be creepy.
B003QSJDZQ|4.0|Had not seen this movie since i was a kid.  It's adorable.  David Spade is so funny as the voice of the Llama.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Poor video production, very poor story line.<br />I could not sit and view the whole movie and could not understand why others rate this movie higher.
B000I186FW|5.0|One of the best distopian society movies I've ever seen.  How the protagonist manages to show so much acting skill with a mask on through the whole movie is nothing short of amazing.  Love the plot, the imagery, the sets - everything.  This is a clever, finely nuanced, and finally uplifting look at Everyman's response to evil with plenty of surprise twists to keep you guessing.  Buy it - you won't regret it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This will be one of my shortest reviews ever, as many other people more qualified than me can give you more technical details, but here goes:<br /><br />Does it do what it says it will?  Yes.<br /><br />Does it work with our TV?  Yes, actually it does with both of them (of course not at the same time)<br /><br />Is it a good value for the Price?  Yes.<br /><br />I'd give it an honest 4.5 star review on the product alone.  5 stars when you consider the price, and it might be 5 stars if ANY upgrades come to it (make it easier to mirror my phone on my tv directly.)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is okay but it says you've been gone this long and played this  long and it is all wrong.
140006922X|3.0|The central argument of Zealot is this: Jesus, like other messianic figures of his day, called for the violent expulsion of Rome from Israel. Driven by religious zeal, Jesus believed that God would empower him to become the king of Israel and overturn the hierarchical social order. Jesus believed that God would honor the zeal of his lightly armed disciples and give them victory. Instead, Jesus was crucified as a revolutionary. Early Christians changed the story of Jesus to make him into a peaceful shepherd. They did this for two reasons: because Jesus' actual prediction had failed, and because the Roman destruction of rebellious Jerusalem in AD 70 made Jesus' real teachings both dangerous and unpopular. Paul radically changed the identity of Jesus from human rebel to divine Son of God, against the wishes of other leaders like Peter and James.<br /><br />To be fair to Aslan, there are several strengths to his book. He explains well the multifaceted economic, political and religious setting of first-century Palestine (with some exceptions pointed out below). While heavily influenced by Crossan, he abandons some of Crossan's more bizarre claims. Interestingly, Aslan points out what strong eyewitness evidence there is for the resurrection, although ultimately he says that the resurrection is the sort of thing that historians simply cannot evaluate. He points out that Jesus' contemporaries fully believed that Jesus performed healing miracles. Aslan also explains some things that most Christians are not aware of, but are widely accepted by both believing and non-believing scholars of the gospels. For example, Aslan correctly writes that Jews before Jesus were not expecting the messiah to be divine or for him to die and rise from the dead. He correctly explains the original significance of some of Jesus' titles such as \\"Son of God\\" and \\"Son of Man,\\" both of which had kingly connotations before Jesus.<br /><br />However, Zealot is seriously flawed in many ways. There are many factual errors (some of which I will highlight below), but more importantly, Aslan's approach matches the flawed approach of Jesus Seminar scholars, which is almost guaranteed to produce a skewed picture of Jesus.<br /><br />Zealot's claim is essentially a conspiracy theory: Jesus was really a proclaimer of violent revolution, but the gospels and Paul covered up the evidence. Aslan then has a typical conspiracy-theory approach: any time the gospels present evidence against Aslan's theory, they were making it up; any time the gospels present evidence in favor of Aslan's theory, they were telling the truth. This is found countless times in Zealot, but a few examples will suffice.<br /><br />Aslan is certain that Jesus never said \\"My kingdom is not of this world\\" (John 18:36), because of course that would be evidence against Aslan's theory. The idea that Jesus was \\"an inveterate peacemaker\\" is a \\"complete fabrication\\" by the evangelists.1 Apparently, according to Aslan, Jesus never said \\"If anyone compels you to go one mile, go with him two\\" (Matt 5:41, talking about submission to soldiers who demand labor) or \\"Do not resist the one who is evil\\" (Matt 5:39). Although Aslan does not deny the historicity of Jesus' parables, he dismisses them as impossible to understand - a claim that would surprise most modern scholars of the gospels. Aslan needs to dismiss the parables because the Kingdom of God described in the parables is mostly incompatible with violent revolution.<br /><br />But Aslan is perfectly willing to accept the gospels' testimony whenever it helps him. He accepts the historicity of sayings from Jesus such as \\"I have not come to bring peace, but a sword\\" (Matt 10:34) and \\"the kingdom of God suffers violence, and the violent take it by force\\" (Matt 11:12).  Of course, Aslan ignores the clear context of those sayings, which has nothing to do with violent revolution. Aslan mostly dismisses the gospel accounts of Jesus' arrest as entirely fictional, so he doesnot accept that Jesus stopped Peter from using a sword: \\"Put back your sword... For all who take up the sword will die by the sword\\" (Matt 26:51-52). But Aslan is quite willing to accept that Luke is correct when he records Jesus saying, earlier that evening, \\"Let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one\\" (Luke 22:36). This pattern is repeated over and over in Zealot. It is simply an unfair and extremely biased treatment of the historical evidence. It presents Aslan as somehow having secret knowledge that allows him to correctly identify when the four evangelists were accurate and when they were fabricating. In reality, Aslan is simply ignoring most of the evidence against his theory.<br /><br />The second big thrust of Zealot's claim is that the peaceful, divine Jesus was made up primarily by Paul. According to Zealot, Peter and James sharply opposed Paul's claim that Jesus was divine. The New Testament on several occasions does describe conflict: between Paul and Barnabas, between Paul and Peter, and between Paul and men from James. Aslan tries to pretend that all these arguments were about the identity of Jesus, and that Barnabas, Peter and James believed in Jesus as a human messiah against Paul's view of a divine Christ. But this is simply nonsense. The disagreement between Paul and Barnabas is over the inclusion of Mark in their mission team, and Paul's disagreement with James and Peter is over whether Gentiles need to keep Jewish laws such as circumcision and food laws.<br /><br />Here again, Aslan is very selective in his use of evidence. He accepts the letter of James as being authorized by James, because it helps him emphasize (and exaggerate) differences between James and Paul. But he never even mentions the epistles of Peter, because of course they show that Peter is in agreement with Paul about who Jesus is. While pointing out the difference between James' and Paul's theology, Aslan doesn't mention that James has an equally high view of Jesus: he is \\"our glorious Lord Jesus Christ\\" (James 2:1) who will return to judge (James 5:7). Aslan also ignores all of the evidence in the New Testament for agreement and harmony between the apostles, such as Paul's collection of money for poor Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Aslan's conspiracy approach continues in this section of his book. Why does Paul make a sacrifice in Jerusalem? It must be that James forced him to recant his heretical views, not (as Luke claims) to complete a Nazirite vow that Paul voluntarily began before arriving in Jerusalem. Why does Luke end the book of Acts with Paul's imprisonment, not his death? It must be to cover up some damning evidence against Paul! (No mention of the idea that Luke ended Acts then because that's when he wrote Acts).<br /><br />Perhaps not surprisingly, the claims in Zealot come with a fair degree of scholarly arrogance (which I acknowledge many scholars are prone to!). Aslan says that his goal is to \\"purge the scriptures of their literary and theological flourishes and forge a far more accurate picture of the Jesus of history... Everything else is a matter of faith.\\" In other words, when Aslan accepts some information from the gospels and rejects the rest, that is scholarly and historical; but if someone accepts other information from the gospels, their view is not scholarly or historical, but \\"a matter of faith.\\" The parts of the gospels that Aslan agrees with are historical; the parts that he doesn't agree with are \\"literary and theological flourishes.\\" Of course, Aslan often tries to explain why he thinks that some claim in the gospels is unhistorical, but taken as a whole, it is impossible to ignore the essential arbitrariness of his choices.<br /><br />This scholarly hubris is also apparent in Zealot's determination to point out contradictions in the New Testament accounts. For example, Aslan wants to make sure that we know that Luke is mistaken when he says that the seven Hellenistic deacons (Acts6) were primarily in charge of distributing food. They also engaged in preaching and evangelism, Aslan tells us. How does Aslan know that Luke is wrong? By reading the rest of Acts 6 and 7. In other words, Luke was not wrong - he just had more to say on the next page. Aslan is convinced that Pilate's trial of Jesus is \\"a complete fabrication\\" by the evangelists, because Aslan is certain that he knows how Pilate thinks. Pilate, in Aslan's telling, would have absolutely no problem sending someone to the cross without any trial at all. He bases this on a single line from the Jewish philosopher Philo, exaggerated out of proportion.<br /><br />Finally, despite his generally good understanding of the field, Aslan makes a number of significant errors. I took pages of notes just on historical and linguistic errors in Zealot. Here are only a few examples of significant scholarly errors: use of Greek definitions not found in any standard Greek lexicon; using the wrong Greek lexicon for the New Testament; incorrect definition of the targumim; unawareness of the evidence for high literacy in ancient Israel; unawareness of literary approaches to the gospels; claims that Pilate crucified \\"thousands upon thousands\\" without trial; very late, unlikely dates for the writing of the four gospels; claims that ancient people did not understand the concept of history; claims that Luke was knowingly writing fiction, not history; claims that Mark does not describe Jesus' resurrection; and on and on. In many cases, I had to come to the conclusion that Aslan was just not familiar enough with modern scholarship related to the New Testament.<br /><br />There are numerous other problems with Zealot. Aslan repeatedly presents highly unlikely interpretations of passages in the New Testament, makes little effort to defend those interpretations, then moves on as if he has made his case. Suffice to say this, as others have said before: there is something a little bizarre about using our only historical documents about Jesus (the New Testament) to come to conclusions quite in opposition to those documents. There is a good reason to believe that Jesus claimed to be a divine king and savior who would die and rise again, and would one day return to judge the world: All four gospels, and indeed the entire New Testament make this claim. You can deny that this claim is true, but it is scholarly folly to deny that Jesus and the early Christians believed it.

0865479410|5.0|If you have read my other reviews you will know I have read 100's of self help books over the years. I am a business consultant, peak performance expert, entrepreneur and University lecturer amongst other things. As such I read books in order to improve my knowledge and the advice I can give others. I ordered this book via the Vine programme in the hope I may end up learning something new about how the mind can create happiness without all the positive thinking garbage that some book push.<br /><br />The saying, \\"A mind can make a heaven out of hell or a hell out of heaven\\" is something I strongly believe in. We are in fact masters of our own happiness through the way we view the world around us. I started reading about how cognitive belief systems can control the world we see many years ago when I read Psycho Cybernectics by Maxwell Maltz. The premise of this book is that the way a person sees themselves and so thinks, affects the self esteem and so affects every part of their life, including the ability to be happy. The problem with most motivational/self help books are that they assume that by setting goals, thinking positively and using mantra like affirmations people can achieve anything they want to achieve. The great falsehood with this, is that for many, past programming and the way people view their pasts is the critical block which goal setting does not address. Most people who are unsuccessful/depressed/going nowhere etc assume the problem is outside of them, so by using most motivational books they put the responsibility to be successful on somebody else's \\"system\\", without first realising how they are thinking is the cause of the dissatisfaction.<br /><br />This book by Oliver Burkeman is very different, as the author clearly states from the outset that he is not offering the reader a foolproof way of becoming successful, what he offers is wise advice on the topics of \\"Happiness\\". The premise of the book is in order to become happier you must stop chasing happiness and embrace all the things that can go wrong in your life and just accept them. In essence it is very similar to Buddhist thinking of detachment of thought and becoming a mere observer of your thoughts....\\"What we resist we get more of in our lives....\\" is the idea. By embracing problems we in essence can detach ourselves from the self made negative connotations/interpretations of how WE see disasters in our own lives. Maltz in Psycho Cybernetics claimed that a damaged self image is the core reason for so much failure. By detaching from the negative thoughts/connotations of problems that affect the self image and so changing how we see ourselves, we in essence slowly embrace happiness by becoming less anxious about how we see past. Does it work? The author gives no promises but I think it will certainly help an individual find greater peace in their lives and so help repression of negativity, which is always a good thing.<br /><br />This book is very different from most self help books. I think it should be read in conjunction with Psycho Cybernetics as this will give the reader a better understanding of how the mind can \\"Make a Hell out of Heaven and a Heaven out of Hell.\\" It is a very motivating read and it should help the reader become happier with their lives by embracing problems.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Still a classic. My favorite of the entire series. And some lessons about the nature of leadership, loyalty and friendship
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This games is awesome!!!!! I love this game I recommend it to any one who likes dragons and farm sort off games. I hope this helps.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I thought the book was good but slow moving - I enjoyed the authors previous books more.  I recommend it - but not highly.
B001QB9H10|5.0|A hero even I can like...Jason is perfect in this role and I loved his interactions with the kid in the movie.
1476712042|5.0|Loved the storyline. I couldn't put the book down. Abby and Travis are meant for each other, and this book does a great job at showing it.
B002APU580|5.0|I am not a Kiera Knightly fan so did not expect to like this but it was awesome and excellent....
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I initially wondered why the GoPro Hero3 did not include an interactive LCD screen as a standard feature.  It's obvious to me now that some don't want the extra weight/size factor to limit their potential uses.  That said, the value of the Hero3 is exponentially increased by adding the BacPac accessory.  Easier to use, access settings and ability to view what you've just shot are all good reasons to include this in your set up.  Be warned, it's a battery hog, but you can turn the screen off when not in use.<br /><br />Buy it (along with some extra batteries) and your GoPro life will get easier and more &#34;real-time&#34; accesible!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is the kind of movie i love to see...relatively authentic, good pacing, great costuming, and awesome acting. Would love to see more of these type of movies about other historical figures...
B00ADS98FC|5.0|The movie was hysterical from start to finish! Perfect movie after a stressful week at work to just make some popped corn and curl up on the couch for some laughs!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have ready many, many books, but can honestly say that this book is frickin' Amazing. After doing one of the experiments from this book I was able to create exactly what I was looking for which was money which I needed quick. Long story short within 12 hours I received $1000 from an unknown source... this author knows her stuff... read it, you won't be disappointed. BTW- She could charge $50 for this book and it would be a steal!
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|First off: to get the movie's digital download included with the disc, email the WB digital copy department with the &#34;expired&#34; code in the DVD case.  They'll send you a new code that can be redeemed in iTunes or other formats.  I actually got an email response with a working code less than half an hour after contacting them, which surprised me greatly (I was expecting it to take several days).<br /><br />Forewarning: I have never read the Watchmen graphic novel.  I saw the original showing of this film opening night with some fellow college roommates and absolutely loved it at the time.  Other than that one viewing in 2009, up until now I've only ever seen TV rebroadcasts of the movie, which are obviously censored to some degree.  This director's cut has everything that the theatrical release had, plus many scenes that were cut to keep the theatrical runtime under 3 hours.  There's only one &#34;new&#34; scene that I felt was completely pointless; all others added further depth to the Watchmen universe to great benefit.<br /><br />As a casual fan of the Watchmen movie, this is exactly what I want.  If I ever get around to reading the actual Watchmen graphic novel, then I'm sure the extended edition with the Tales Of The Black Freighter addition would be the better buy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found this to be a well thought out,book, the material was well studied and based on historical fact.  Although the premise was unusual the book was a walk down memory lane for me.  I lived these days and thought the details were very accurate.  It brought back the horror we all felt on 11-22-63.  The perspective of following Oswald through his life was unusual and interesting.  Makes us wonder if changing history is for the better or worse.  Highly recommend this, especially for those who lived it.
B00AX6KNOY|3.0|This movie was a good movie but I did not like the fact that the movie was a little slow
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it was a pretty cool game, but all the advertising gets annoying.. you know what i mean? Haha lol lol
B006GLN3WY|3.0|For only 8 episodes I would think that the price could be better for the season.  It was too high priced but still the same t.v show that I love!

0792162803|1.0|I like Molly Shannon and I hoped to like this movie, but it was awful.  I really liked Wayne's World, (another SNL spinoff) and Never Been KIssed (Molly Shannon plays supporting role). This movie just isn't funny.  I could not stand the scenes where Mary (played by Molly Shannon) makes out with a tree or stop sign.  I know it is a form of comedy where you feel so bad for the main character that it is funny at the same time (Bridesmaids) - but this missed the mark. I watched it until the end and I wish I had my time back.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|While I enjoy the game; it is horrible. to pay for something you can not use.  I paid for U. Bolt and unable to access it or get the money back.  NOT GOOD!!!!!!!
B0087XBUS8|3.0|After I watched a couple of episodes of Game of Thrones on cable, I decided I should take a look at the book. Much to my surprise, there are three or four additional books in the series, depending on what day it is. I'd become a fan of fantasy after reading Lord of the Rings, so in between everything else I read, I'm always on the lookout for a good fantasy to get immersed in. As a writer I have to admire the complexity of world building the author must undertake while creating characters and a plot that'll engage me.<br /><br />I just finished reading a review, one that I would have to call a diatribe. Though the reviewer made a few valid points in his criticisms, overall I found the review disagreeable and unhelpful. Seems to me if you don't like a book, just say so. Less is more, even in a review.<br /><br />Having said that, I like these books so far, I'm halfway through the third book in the series, and boy howdy do you ever get your money's worth with these 800+ page volumes. I do admit, over all, the feeling is dark and dreary. Unhappiness abounds, even in victory there is great loss, and there is a lot of loss.<br /><br />I admire the author for having spent so much time developing this world for me to explore. I have a friend who spent four years writing a fantasy book equal in length to just one of these. She complained when her beta reader finished it in four hours. Yikes! I hope that reader was a fast reader. Four years of writing...four hours of reading,that would be like spending a week setting up 100,000 dominos and have them fall over in sixty seconds.<br /><br />Would I recommend this series? Yes I would. Do I love it? No, I just like it.<br /><br />review by Shelley Riley author of [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]
