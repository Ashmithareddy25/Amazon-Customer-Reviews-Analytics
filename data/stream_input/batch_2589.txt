B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was a gift and the person who received it was excited and happy. Very pleased to complete his collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great insight to the time period in England during WW1.  The way it was with both the wealthy and the servants.  Love the fashion.  Very much waiting to see Season 3.
B004G0SJU8|1.0|Should have won Academy Award for most boring movie.  My husband and I fell asleep and woke up later in the movie and didn't miss anything.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its very cool but hard to get the truck and the snow mobile and the tank but it is very fun and you start out with the jeep.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's really awesome really cool. it's good for all ages shapes and sizes it is the best game yet! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Being a parent, I could relate to how it must feel to have your own son on trial, but so glad I don't have to have that experience in real life.  I didn't see the ending coming.
0064430170|2.0|We bought this book thinking it'd be great to get our baby daughter listening to us read it as part of her bedtime routine. We started reading it for about a week and I couldn't help but shake the feeling that there was something creepy about this book, but feeling silly about it, I didn't say anything to my wife. Then one day, it bothered me too much and I had to ask her \\"Hey, does this book creep you out a little bit?\\" and she said yes. From then on, we decided to switch it out. Our friends highly recommended [[ASIN:0689836325 Counting Kisses]] instead and so we gave it a try. Counting Kisses ends in lots of giggles and lots of little kisses all over our daughter. Goodight Moon now sits in the bookcase, although part of me thinks I need to bring it to an exorcist.
B00406O7YK|4.0|I love hearing Barbra sing in anything, but the story was very contrived and she didn't have a lot to work with in the plot.  The musical numbers were great!
B0040JHXTI|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this release and waited almost a year to write this review. I'll try to keep it short and to the point. Here's my criticisms:<br />1. I thought that this set was way overpriced. The BTR box set is around $25 to $30. Yes you received more material, but more material doesn't equal quality material. For a guy singing about the blue collar working man, they're sure sticking it to him with this overpriced set.<br />2. The outtakes discs could've been cut down to one disc. I thought that some of that material wasn't even listenable. There's a reason why it ended up on the cutting room floor, albeit Bruce is known for having some outstanding throwaways. I believe the best from these sessions ended up on Tracks. So these were probably leftovers of leftovers. I also didn't like the idea that he rewrote lyrics and re-recorded songs. The idea behind a release such as this one is to capture a moment in time. If the song wasn't complete, it wasn't complete. Don't include it.<br />3. It appears Jon Landeau was trying to come up with any material (to up the price) to put on this box set including recent performances of the album. I didn't care too much for the Asbury Park footage or the documentary. The documentary wasn't horrible, but wasn't outstanding. Again stick to the time period.<br />4. Don't care for the packaging. I'm not a fan of these cardboard sleeves. Too easy for discs to get scratched.<br /><br />The good:<br />1. The DOTEOT remaster is outstanding, a great album receiving it's proper treatment.<br />2. The 78 Houston concert is Bruce at his best. Lots of energy and a great setlist.<br /><br />My recommendation is that if you must have it, pick it up used.<br /><br />I know a lot of fans will upset with my rating, but this is what I believe. Too many fans don't want to give honest reviews. I've been listening to Bruce since 78 and loved his stuff through out the 80's and then The Rising. After that, not so much. Bruce once talked about blind faith in your leaders on Live 75-85. Maybe so many shouldn't have blind faith in musicians.
B0036UW09U|5.0|I love anything<br />Barbra Streisand is in and she was so good in this.  Kris Kristofferson was excellent also.  I loved the story also.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Being the mother of a child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, I could relate to how hard is it to find appropriate care.  I thought the movie was very well done.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this novel down.  I wanted to know how it ended, but felt the author wandered around to find an ending  I am still thinking about what might have happened after it ended.
B004LROMWU|5.0|The first season has started well...I only hope they don't go down the same road as sooooo many other sci-fi series and become a &#34; let's do this for the good 'ol USA&#34; ....keep it dark, and keep it edgy. Good guys don't always win. Please stay &#34;realistic&#34; with the script and you will keep a huge following.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I am a great fan and this album did not disappoint.  I play it in my car and home often.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|At almost 1200 pages I was a little Leary of even starting this book but I got sucked in as quickly as I did for the previous books. I'm about to buy the next!
0345529057|5.0|This was a fantastic buy for the price.  I had followed the series, and I couldn't wait until next April to get immersed in the land of Westeros.  The books make for some of the best reading I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing, but specifically the books are nice to look as well as durable.  Durable, at least, for the binding, but the cover will show creases quite easily.  That is the consequence of the nice looking material.  In any case, they look very nice on the shelf in their holder or otherwise.<br /><br />One thing to mind, though, the books are fairly smaller than I was expecting.  I'm not complaining, but it is certainly worth pointing out.  Just look at the product details and figure out if you will be comfortable with them.  Also, there is in fact, many small blemishes of ink in or discoloration that I've noticed in my books.  They are not at all distracting or a hindrance to your reading experience, just noticeable.  However, if you're someone who likes to have the inside of their books in pristine condition, I will say you might be somewhat irritated at these.<br /><br />In conclusion, for the price I got I would make the decision to buy these again every time.  Just remember that there are more books so this collection of the first four just gets you halfway there.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Overall this was a very good movie, with numerous attempts to explain scenes from the original Oz movie. Some of these are obvious and some subtle. You need to be attentive to catch them all (and I am sure I did not).<br /><br />First, the music in the original &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; was one of the best parts of the film, with many memorable tunes and songs that live quite well outside the film. However, the music in this film, even if by the famed Danny Elfman, is not in the slightest memorable.<br /><br />Second, the transformation of the wicked witch jsut doesn't quite work for me. This is largely because I am so familiar with the original. The new &#34;wicked witch&#34; looks at bit like she has the mumps, and I find that distracting.<br /><br />Third, and I may simply have missed this, but I did not see the set up to the ruby slippers with the wicked witch's sister (thant is,t he one Dorothy lands on and kills in the original Wizard movie. Not that this really affects the new movie, but it seems a missed opportunity.<br /><br />I would recommend it but there are a few things that I found.... slightly distracting.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Each door is solvable with a little time and thinking. Have not had one that was so hard I wanted to give up on the entire game.
0425263924|1.0|I love these characters and wish their story was being dragged out. A friend asked me what happened in this book and I honestly couldn't say anything happened other than they got married. I enjoy Ms. Day's writing, but was disappointed the TRILOGY took this turn.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|You thought Breezeblocks was the only song that was good?  Buy this album.  I rarely buy music thanks to spoitfy, but I had to buy this to support these guys.  I recently saw them at Bonnaroo and was blown away.  They are a true true talent that needs all the respect in the world.  I recommend buying this and putting it on repeat.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think DOWNTON ABBEY is the best thing I have seen on TV in forever!  I have seen all  3 times!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This movie is so unique.  I first saw it on HBO and thought wow... I have to buy this!  It's such a fun and quirky movie.  It made me feel like I was a kid again.  The acting is superb and the camera work is very beautiful.  The set design is also just spot on.  If you grew up a boyscout or in the 60's this movie is going to hit home for you.  Highly recommend buying this movie!
1451648537|5.0|A very readable, entertaining, informative, and insightful look at one of the greatest technological visionaries of our time. Isaacson's writing style is smooth, nicely paced and the chapters are broken up in digestible sections...I've just checked out his Einstein book from the library. 05-2012
B007N85POS|5.0|Who knew you could have so much fun with \\"birds\\"! And never a messy cage to clean up! I never want to \\"kick\\" this habit . Go Rio Birds!
0439023513|5.0|A fitting end to a thought provoking and emotional trilogy.  Now I can go and watch The Hunger Games movie with the added interest that a number of scenes were shot locally. 4-2012
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have to say that The Silver Linings Playbook was the best novel I've read so far this year. I finished it all in one sitting, it was so captivating. Nothing is better than the surprise of being able to connect with the main character and following them in their desperate endeavors when you hope for their success throughout the novel. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />And now you can read the book and then watch Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence act it out :)
0307472841|5.0|A fascinating novel that spans a period of 140 years and spans across several continents with twists and turns and yet, remains fairly straight forward plot-wise.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Any one who doesn't play this games needs to download it and play it trust me it is a really  awesome games.
1400031567|5.0|Another well paced Kurt Wallander detective novel. Mankell has a way of incorporating the mundane day to day chores of a detective into the story without making them seem trivial. 02-2011
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I keep trying to download the game but it will not download.  I loved the ds version and when my brother told me about this version I was so excited.  I would regimens this game but be prepared to have some extra time to wait . As I always say &quot;patience is a virtue&quot;.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Great movie!! Outstanding storytelling and stellar performances.  Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte, and Joel Edgerton gave very believable performances of a family trying to find a path to forgiveness. The movie score by Mark Isham is beautiful and The National's song \\"About Today\\" is the perfect song for the scene between the brothers at the end.  Loved the movie and it is definitely part of my collection!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|After playing this on the nintendo DS I thought I'd never get to experience this great game again. It's great to be able to replay a level and solve it in a different way than the first time. This will keep young and old busy. And it's great playing solo or with friends.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This release from Daft Punk is not the same as their other albums. It has a more jazz sound to me but the over all sound is the same high quality that Daft Punk always delivers.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|We (my family) are long time fans of Die Hard. This latest installment of the Die Hard series was just plain bad. There were maybe two or three moments we found entertaining, which is why it garnered two stars instead of one. Those moments did not justify the wasted time and money expended on watching this movie. The action is nothing special. The dialog is dumb and flat. Bruce Willis seemed bored. Just don't waste your time or money. If you HAVE to see it, wait until you can stream it for free.
1400049628|5.0|I will survive the zombie horde! You will too with this hilarious guide to the living dead. Boom. Headshot. Buy it.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I guess it is difficult to write another novel as outstanding as his previous 2. I enjoyed this book but not as much as the kite runner and a thousand splendid subs. This story is about the difficulty of family life in Afghanistan in the early 1900s. It is about live, loyalty and generations of family.
B00BU9DXAY|4.0|An interesting exploration of the inexplicable behavior of dogs.  Its a picture book that will entertain anyone that lives with a dog.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I watched the series when it was on TV.  I am so disappointed they cancelled it.  The talent of the cast is amazing, it is pure entertainment.
B00AJF87QU|5.0|Love this album. its better than the last couple of albums. Indian summer is a great single.can't wait to see them this summer.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I haven't stopped listening to this album yet and it's been more than 2 months.  Is it possible to get tired of great music? Of Monsters and Men is making it hard to fall in love with any other music!
1442419814|3.0|This is one of those times when I'm not sure a man can really write a believable female heroin. Don't get me wrong, there are men who have done it beautifully, but this really didn't feel like one of those times. This novel was good, but I really missed the emotion. It was a little monotoned. I searched this novel for something quotable (funny, maddening, heart-wrenching, sad...) I couldn't find anything worthwhile.<br /><br />The best part about this novel other than the interesting idea, were the villains. I loved that they looked and acted like predators.<br /><br />Read more of my review on my blog - Read it in Houston ( readinhouston.blogspot.com )
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I typically try to stay away from rap and &#34;mainstream hiphop&#34;, but I had to get this album because I fell in love with &#34;stay&#34; after I heard it on the radio.  The rest of the album is nothing but greatness.  The only song that wasn't good was &#34;Nobody's Business&#34;.  I can't help but to think she sounds exactly like Beiber! Ugh! I turn it off every time!
0738737909|5.0|This deck is very beautifully designed, but it is far more than just beautiful- it is profound! The level of detail is outstanding, not only for its visual appeal, but also for the care and exact selection of the symbolism incorporated into each card.<br /><br />I watched the later stages of development of this deck via social media, and STILL was bowled over when I received my copy of the kit! I thought that after reading cards for close to 40 years I was beyond that level of astonishment- but I found myself happily mistaken!<br /><br />The Minor Arcana are pictorial, meaning that each card tells a story, with great attention to each exquisite detail. The court cards and suits include diverse types of people, participating in all sorts of activities- so you can be sure the full range of actions are portrayed in a way that will make your readings come to life.<br />The Major Arcana are beyond striking; their depth and grandeur is so absorbing that I strongly recommend an extensive period of study and meditation with each card before use, so that the reader does not become lost in the art, and become derailed from the point of the reading. This deck has so much to sink your teeth into, that you must be sure you are ready for the feast!<br />The book is equally well produced. The card interpretations are meaty, yet not so all-inclusive that they rob you of the ability to incorporate your own interpretations of the meanings. Kim Huggens successfully strikes a delicate balance in accomplishing this- and it is a masterful effort worthy of this deck's artistry. The print quality is also outstanding. There is a more extensive version of this book available in electronic format, and judging from the merit of this shorter version, I suspect this will prove to be an impressive and scholarly effort.<br /><br />I don't think this deck is appropriate for the average beginner, but if you have some experience, and the willingness to navigate through the intricacies of this card system, you will find yourself in a wonderland where you will learn a great deal, and find yourself giving readings of great potency and poetry! I have not been able to keep my eyes or hands off them since they arrived! The few people who have received readings from me with this deck have been equally bowled over!<br />If you are hesitating about making this purchase, hesitate no longer! These are top notch! The print quality is excellent, the card stock is heavy and sturdy, made to stand up to actual use, and even the box is a keeper- beautifully made, with a magnetic closure. This deck will give great pleasure for many years to come, with it's depth and scope, it's visual drama, and it's superior craftsmanship.<br />Well done, Erik C. Dunne, Kim Huggens, and Lo Scarabeo!<br />This kit was received specifically for review purposes.land where you will learn a great deal, and find yourself giving readings of great potency and poetry!

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Bad Luck and Trouble was a very good read. Jack Reacher has all the right moves and answers to every mystery. I have read every one in the series. Good job, Lee Child
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It's still fun for a little while. This game won't keep you interested for long due to the immature graphics style and the fact that the same car and track play over, and over, and over, and over..........Unless you pay.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This reminds me of the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child. I love these type of mysteries.Baldacci is getting really good keeping the suspense.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this is the best game in the world if you like cars then you will like this one ,
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love to play this when I lie in bed at night. It is a good change up from reading every night.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Since I have enjoyed this series so much on the Hallmark cable channel, I decided to give a set of the DVDs to my sister who was unable to get these episodes on her cable system. I have talked with her several times recently and she has told me how much she is really enjoying each episode in the series. She remarked that the episodes build on each other; the characters are all interesting: and each story has its own charm.<br /><br />Plus, it is so nice to be able to watch them when you want to and without a lot of commercials.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|man this game is crewmen cool you should get it you will like it and you will love it its addicting
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|I was impressed by the stunning visuals and storyline of Oz.  Raimi, the director, has created a fitting prequel that really does help set up the original.  I didn't think the sidekicks -- Finley and China Girl (Bowie fans, start singing) -- would work but they are key elements to the plot and Michelle Williams is delightful as Glinda and Weisz and Kunis are deliciously dark.  The movie also does a great job of showing a somewhat parallel structure the original -- starts off in B&W and characters from the &#34;reality&#34; show up in the &#34;fantasy&#34; world.<br /><br />On the flip side, There are many dark and scary moments that might give kids nightmares:  the witch is quite scary, the trip through the tornado is frightening, the flying monkeys and the dark forest and definitely nightmarish.  My kids didn't get really react negatively towards them but I can see where other kids may.<br /><br />It's really hard to believe that Raimi started off his career directing the Evil Dead series.  Quite ironic that he's now doing movies aimed at children.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of those films that kids will keep watching over and over, so I recommend downloading.  And, don't worry, that box that the film starts off in, widens to normal view when the reach Oz.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|I received this as a gift for Mother's Day after my previous cover fell apart. I love this cover. I especially love the look of it. It does remind me of an older styled book cover. It is easy to clean if need be and it is aesthetically pleasing.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I've used Ultimate Guitar Tabs for years, but I'd have print them out and keep them in my binder and stuff ended up all over the place.  Now, just save everything to favorites and your ready to go.  No more printing for practice.  Now, if I could just use the tabs when there isn't Wi-Fi.  Maybe in a different version. Perfect for busy musicians
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Oh...My...God!  This movie is absolutely fabulous!  I'm so sorry I didn't see it in the theater; but even on my laptop this movie rings every bell!  It brings the vote for the 13th Amendment to LIFE!  It seems that nothing much has changed in Congress since 1865.  Daniel Day-Lewis is beyond perfect in the role of Lincoln...an absolute master of his craft.  Of course it is a plum role for any actor, and I have seen lots of players in the role.  But none gave it the humanity that he brings to it.  SEE THIS MOVIE if you care about America and what it should stand for!
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|Worked stright out the Box used copy paper at first  not a good resalt but when i used 120gsm card it worked fine<br /> and worked well with thicker card.<br />orderd from Amazon USA and recived in 7 days first class, After being let down in the UK
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughters is always asking to play this game. I love that she is so involved in a game that makes her think about what to do next.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|this is the best superhero movie ever made. Every moment is great and serves the fans what we wanted all along.
B005HSL626|4.0|When I first got this game I loved it. The only thing I don't like about it is how I get bored after a short amount of time. It is a really fun game for a while but I would prefer other games such as Temple Run and Cut The Rope.
B0026IUXO2|4.0|Elizabeth is a good movie.  The script and acting are on point and the subject is really interesting!  Cate Blanchett is great in this film.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app! I first got it on my iPod and it ran really slow but then I got it on my Kindle Fire and it was awesome! This is a fun game for all ages and I recommend it to everyone!
B00CWVBTUU|5.0|Me and the girlfriend were bored one night looking for something to watch. When she wasn't looking I ordered this. I figured I would bear the brunt of the complaint tornado that would form immediately in my living room. I'm a giant comic fanboi but I've never been too into DC.<br /><br />Anyway, 5 minutes into this movie the complaints stopped because we were dying laughing. This is a great movie for kids, but even adults can enjoy it. The creators even stayed true to the comic book canon.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how well done this movie was. Great job guys.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is SO fun and SO addictive! It's a great challenge that I never get bored with! I think it is a cute concept too. My favorite thing is the monster. Its sooo cute! Great game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's kinda brainless, but before you know it you've gone to the next level and then the next - grandkids love it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The is the coolest version of any tempel run or run game you will ever play. So get it and you will never regret it
0802473156|5.0|My boyfriend had this book but never read pass Chapter 1. So I ordered the book so we could read it together. It has helped us get to know each others Love Language and we are talking about marriage now! Its a great book to start a relationship off with.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book had perfect timing as I had just lost my Mother from  Alzheimer's. I believe what Dr. Eben Alexander experienced was real and had a true ADE.
1480054542|5.0|I spent a weekend reading this novel, and although I'm not a fan of the romance genre, I found myself reading frantically to the very last page. A well developed plot and characters to care for, Finding Pride tells the story of Megan Kimble, escaping her past and trying to begin a new future. Megan has a heartbreaking backstory, and you pull for her any chance you get. I really like the message of starting over and getting a second chance in life. If you are a fan of romance, you will enjoy this novel
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Using the Civil War as a backdrop for the main plot was brilliant. Make-up was superb and the<br />combination of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef masterful. Wallach is a stand-out as 'Tuco'<br />the angry Mexican who has a keen knack for survival when his life is on the line and I feel that<br />he stole the spotlight in this movie.
B001KK2NDQ|4.0|It is a good cook book.  I am not sure I will like all the recipes because when it says French cooking it IS.<br />Definitely stuff in here I have no desire to make or eat.
0812550706|5.0|Can't go into detail, But this book showed up on my radar around the time of the first movie trailer and has been a welcome edition in my library.<br /><br />I recommend to all readers that seek a Truth about the savageness found in life and the stuggle all creatures face.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I love this movie. Chris is awesome!!! Can't wait for the sequel to come out!!!! I would totally recommend to anyone
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Tried to give it a shot for a few days but I could no longer handle the noise that this little guy added to my music. The boost was minimal anyway so it was not even remotely worth it... Save your $$.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so great that I am totally glad that I purchased it for that super low free price.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Very nice wine-rack to compliment any stainless appliances you may have in your kitchen. Installs easy and holds strong if installed properly.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Okay, I did not watch the entire 3D movie, but flipped through long enough to know a few things.  A, the movie DID NOT need to be in 3D and doesn't really present itself in great 3D fashion, such as the recent JURASIC PARK conversion (which is awesome.)  B, the 2D redular old BLU RAY is spectacular, with a great cleaned up image, huge picture and amazing sound. This is the best version of the film you are likely to get, although time and grain are present more in some scenes than others, but for 11 bucks used - this is fun - and the 3D is certainly fun to watch on the dogfight scenes.  For fans of the movie only - not a superlative 3D experience.
B00007FOMP|3.0|I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S ON WHAT BECAUSE I BOUGHT THEM BOTH FOR MY HUSBAND (WHO'S BEEN HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE), BUT THE \\"WHAT'S GOING ON\\" AND \\"LET'S GET IT ON\\" ALBUMS' SELECTIONS LIKE: \\"MERCY, MERCY ME\\", \\"INNER CITY BLUES\\", \\"DISTANT LOVER\\" (THE STUDIO VERSION, NOT THAT ON-STAGE, LIVE! VERSION), \\"DON'T GO AND TALK ABOUT MY FATHER\\" (A RELIGIOUS GEM), THE \\"TROUBLE MAN\\" THEME (FROM THE '70's BLACKSPLOITATION FILM), THE TITLE TRACKS OF BOTH ALBUMS AND THE EVER-INSPIRATIONAL, \\"SAVE THE CHILDREN\\" (WHICH INSPIRED A DOCUMENTARY I FOUND SO PROFOUND IN MY SOPHOMORE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL, AS IT WAS SHOWN AT NYC's OFF, OFF B'WAY's BEEKMAN THEATRE ON 10th AV IN THE EARLY '70's), LEAVE YOU COMING AWAY HAVING BEEN CLEANSED OF LIFE'S MUCK AND MIRE. THEY'RE 2 FANTASTIC PIECES OF ARTISTRY FULL OF SURPRISE AND EVER-CURRENT PHILOSOPHIES THAT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY NOT BE LOST IN THE WAKE OF TODAY'S TRAGEDIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. PLEASE ENJOY!  I MOST CERTAINLY DO.
B00CBKVMG8|1.0|This movie is not Shaun Penn's greatest work along with bad acting and overpriced at $9.99. I would not watch this unless you pay $1.00 for it and then its a waste of time. I was very disappointed with the entire movie.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|You must watch the Upstairs Downstairs series from the 1970...the whole thing ties in so well and very interesting bit of history
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Stumbled into this via my Kindle Fire.  So glad I bought this series.  Just ordered the next three in the series and will begin the read tonight.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  Would give more than 5 stars if that was a possibility.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I was VERY thankful to receive this cable after purchasing one at a local retail store that for some unknown reason, quit working on my kindle fire after a couple months of use.  The only item I would change about this is the length of the cord as it is difficult at times to find an outlet to plug my kindle into for charging purposes AND continue reading.
0988178532|5.0|Great story about a youth struggling to discover the full extent of his psychic abilities. I was riveted by the plot and definitely didn't expect this science fiction thriller to keep me going as it did. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who enjoys paranormal or science fiction with a twist. Excellent Read!
B000002P5R|5.0|I have always been a Hendrix fanatic. I was able to see him play live three times. I have all his &#34;real&#34; CD's .This one is mostly real,thanks to Eddie Kramers mixing magic.I think Jimi would have approved of this release,unlike many of the others in the past. I would not expect ANY more real Hendrix music at this point.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Super funny and never mean.  One of the few comedians that can make people laugh without it being at the expense of others.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Movie must have stopped and reloaded at least 12 times towards the end of the movie. Took 45 minutes t5o watch the last 15. Totally unacceptable
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Protects my headphones as well as charges them.  Fits neatly into my car's cubbies, or in my purse when I'm on the run.
B007HUD6OS|2.0|It is quite boring, the wortst of the serie and repetitive, it lacks the suspense of the other books, Didn't like it
B0042T8ERQ|2.0|I am not a &#34;movie critic&#34; by any means.  There are very few movies I don't care for.  This sounded fun to watch.  I love &#34;super hero&#34; movies.  The concept they had is great, I even like a few of the actors they had and the roles.  But the movie plot was very &#34;blan&#34; to me.  There was only 1 moment of the entire movie that made me like the main character.  The plot never sucked you in... it could have been so much more.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|This book is good but not in the same class as previous books, ie The kite runner and my favourite a  Thousand Splendid Suns
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|If your child is into lego's and into batman and robin then this is a good movie for them. Many superheros and villains. Just a good cute movie for kids.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I really like it because it is light.  The only thing I would change is to put a rubber band on it to help the flap stay in place while reading.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is such a heartwarming movie - it is both funny and sad at the same time.  The characters are so believable - they capture the Philly Eagle fan!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This is a really cool app, does a lot of neat and great stuff.  However, it is a bit of a battery drainer.  I understand that in order for it to tell you about your batter health it has pull from the battery, but really.  Also, it does seem to run the temperature up a bit on the device.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Not the best movie ever but it was entertaining and had lots of action.  I didnt mind, but it definately has alot of gratuitous gore and blood.
B008IJT0CE|2.0|Great concept, but just didn't really work for me.  Maybe I could never just get the right mix to have that serene sound that others talked about.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Really like this CD. I love listening to her voice. So much more pleasant then the screaming stuff they call music today.
B008393Q2O|5.0|I love this colorful notepad!  I have tried plenty of them and none seem to fit exactly what i need.  It is very easy to use, not to mention fun to use.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say?, I love this show.  Just wish they would quit killing off the characters who are good-hearted.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|did not enjoy the movie, I thought with Barbra Streisand  in it, it should have been great<br />big disappointment, would not watch it again
0142403873|4.0|So, this story has as its star one of the reportedly underdogs of the Universe according to some portions of humanity, the tiny little MOUSE, and frequently, Our Families and Friends seem to be drawn to the NECESSARY WISDOM OF THE UNDERDOGS OF THE UNIVERSE FOR CLEVER SURVIVAL WHICH WE ALL WANT TO SURVIVE. And, so we read these IMAGINATIVE TAILS, and draw each our own LESSONS and conclusions, and THANK our favorite AMAZON and the Author for making this book available for many of us to ADD to our BIG KID AKA ADULT COLLECTIONS, with good pricing, shipping and customer support when needed. Blessings.
B000003AEB|5.0|I really loved this CD when it cam out and it just brings out good memories, I love it and the condition of the CD excellent
0142405809|5.0|YES, this is one of our FAVORITE TAILS, those of THE SNAIL AND THE WHALE, and WE ARE BIG KIDS AKA ADULTS, and we delight in having this book in our libraries as one of our most heartwarming, endearing stories and to tell you more would surely ruin the experience for you, so enough said other than WE LOVE THIS BOOK, which our favorite Amazon provided with good pricing, shipping, and customer support when needed. Thank you, Amazon. Blessings.
1452115567|5.0|This book has great pictures,if you like dogs this is a cute book great story about Maddie the dog.Great coffee table book good price .
0307271080|5.0|the book is amazing. I love Chimamanda's books, she never dissapoints me. great book great author! get it! read it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this app very much. It gives me hours of fun with the different games included in the app.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|the action, comedy, and surrealism of this movie does the cartoon justice. the development of the characters' backgrounds is a lot more than one might expect, and also gives more credence to the plot. sounds like a good reason for me to go pull it off my shelf and watch it again . . .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the kid earns money to take care of the horse.<br />5yo loves this<br />Easy but has lots of options for the player
0790733226|5.0|I've loaned out several copies to friends and never got them back. You have to watch this movie at least 3 or 4 times to fully notice and understand the intricacies built into the characters, plot, and philosophical concepts related to religion, science, and technology. &#34;Contact&#34; is a very intellectual movie; it is a LOT more than just a movie about being contacted by an extraterrestrial society, and also much more than simply a movie focusing on both real and supposed relationships among science and religion. In the end, there are no &#34;correct answers&#34; given, only &#34;something to mill over&#34;. If I could only have 5 movies in my library, this would be one of them.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this story.  It most certainly can happen in real life and it show's how resilient a person can be with the love of another human being
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am a fan of the short story and he gets what makes a good short story!! I loved his first 2 books and he proved once again to master storytelling in an evocative manner that kept me always reading  to the end of each chapter, no matter how late at night ...and often when I couldn't resist reading the first few words of the next chapter, I couldn't put it down until I read to the end of that one, too!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author is such a great story teller, and in light of the fact that we only hear about this part of the world because of the war, it is refreshing to read about their true lives.  Wonderful
B003SI605K|5.0|Two friends at two different times suggested that I watch this movie. The ladies are Chinese and I am Jamaican but I can so relate especially now. I watched it with my two young daughters and it was just what we needed. This is a movie about mother daughter relationship regardless of background. It's about open relationships that break down barriers after years of pain, heart break and suffering. I recommend this movie to anyone, sit enjoy and then reevaluate the relationships in our lives. It makes you appreciate the good relationships you have.
0805003002|5.0|This is the only book I have ever read that I immediately went back and re-read.  I  appreciate the excellent condition of the book and its perfect dust jacket.  A keeper, for sure. Thanks.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good book, looking forward to watching the movie now to compare/contrast. Feel the book might even have a sequel someday.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|this is the worst movie I can remember watching in a very long time. I would love to have my money back. Babs Steisand must be desperate for work or needs to pump up ego and/or Hollywood thinks a whining Jewish mothef thyme is actually something that is funny.. Amazon should drop the movie, or renegotiate forless than a buck.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is one of the best games for the kindle. It's really fun<br />To play you should really get it
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|rich, fully thought out, suspenseful.  Intricately woven and complex narrative which leads the viewer deeper and deeper into the motives of the characters
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|You know, if Hollywood wanted to make a movie about gay rights, why couldn't they have at least told us that that was what they were doing?<br /><br />Seriously Hollywood? You're resorting to trickery now? are you that desperate to push your political agenda on your audience?<br /><br />Because if you are, then you can say goodbye to my money.<br /><br />The indie film industry is a much better alternative, in my opinion.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie: Meh. It does nothing new, though it does have a deliciously suspenseful atmosphere at the beginning.<br /><br />Unfortunately, said atmosphere quickly devolves into monotony.<br /><br />Cliched one liners, unnecessary overuse of curse words, and pseudo-grittiness are used to cover up just how uninspired this propaganda film is.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Clever, flavorful, fresh, skillful, honest, real, conscious. Its rare to hear from a popular artist in the mainstream airplay rotation with these qualities, but Macklemore has them. God bless this dude for rhyming about sobriety the way he does on this record. Keep on keeping on my man. Peace.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers Is one of my favorite games. I play it daily and they also have different kinds of missions for you to complete. Download it..you will not regret it! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome extreme I love it my favorite app<br />On my kindle I hope you like it too so Mitch fun
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The plot and characters held my attention.  I liked the fact the story moved quickly and had sympathetic characters.  The end was quick and the typical lead in to getting the next installment.  But a bonus was the characters were easy to relate to and the concept of deliberate food shortages in a post apocalyptic society easy to believe.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Loves this app from day 1.... Let's me record stations / save stations and find music by location, genre, or anything u can possible think of....
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I was really expecting more to this story and characters. I guess my expectations were to high. The characters are very shallow and story is weak.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|This game got a little too repetitious and I found it boring after around the 10-15 minute mark.  I'm also getting a little annoyed by all these games that always want you to spend more money for \\"upgrades.\\"  Thankfully I have a password protection on all in-app purchases or I'm sure my kids would have charged up a storm on some of these games.  The neck-snapping sound isn't as bad as some have made it out to be.  My kids actually laughed at that.  The biggest problem with the game is the repetitious gameplay and the fact that the car flips over way too easily.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried several weather aps and this is better in two key categories. Level of detail and customization. Being able to change to what I think is an acceptable temperature range helps plan my day and bicycle riding.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|IT IS A WONDERFULL HISTORY BOOK FULL OF DETAILS WE DID NOT KNOW AND WELL WRITTEN AND KEEPS YOU WANTING TO READ READ READ<br />THE 950 PAGES.<br />JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE THE FALL OF THE GIANTS.<br />GOOD FOR UYOU KEN FOLLET- I HAVE READ ALMOST ALL HIS BOOKS HE IS A WONDERFULL WRITER.
1781162646|5.0|Devin Jones just broke up with this long-time girlfriend. He gets a job at an amusement park during the summer break from college, hoping that the preoccupation will help him to get his mind off of the pain. Instead, he becomes interested in an unsolved murder that happened years before in the amusement park. He also makes the acquaintance of a dying young boy who dreams to ride the rides in Joyland.<br /><br />Sound like a Stephen King novel? Not really. This is much different than what I consider to be his usual work. This book is more of a detective story. But, the wonderful Stephen King character development is still here. It is very difficult not to fall in love with the innocent, well-meaning Devin, the sweet wheelchair-bound Michael, and the worried mother, Annie. Stephen King's excellent settings are here, too. The weather often effectively reflects the emotions of this story. These things make this a winner.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I think once I manage to find some &#34;free&#34; time from all the grass mowing--that I might actually find this game to be entertaining.  I have always loved Mahjong games!
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|megadeth sounds wayyy different...they've changed it up, can't wait to see this live..dave's voice is gravelly, super cool and sexy...songs are great, check it out.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I've used Google Search for many years on various computers and it has always served me well.  Hard to find a suitable replacement.
125000098X|4.0|As usual Mr. Archer write a good book, this one is fine but left you again hanging. Could have been incorporated in the last book Sins of the Father. Look forward to his next book.
0778315673|5.0|I could identify with all four characters. The plot was amazing and full of curve balls. The end was pleasantly inviting into the next read. Although it wasn't a cliff hanger, just a nice invitation.<br /><br />Lydia: The main character, struggles with love and independence. She steps out making life defining choices without much support, with huge reasons to doubt success.<br /><br />Alix: She is a girl on fire, while traveling a road of redemption due to a troubled pass of drug use and a broken home. She doesn't feel sorry for herself she seems more angry than anything. She meets an old flam that captures her heart and forces her to do all that it takes to redeem her reputation and self worth.<br /><br />Carol: Full of self pity and a burden to the people she loves most. Carol is a professional success and personal failure. Things change, and the tables turn that her personal life is trumps her professional without even trying.<br /><br />Jacqueline: Covers her emotions with fooling herself and everyone else into believing her life is perfect. Many of her insecurities stand in the way of her happiness.<br /><br />By the end of the book you walk away knowing no one is perfect. Happy endings come from hard beginnings.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Great show! I realy enjoy the characters. As a fan of historical fiction,This show is very entertaining and the costumes and sceenery are so pretty.
1416550550|5.0|This book was one that my book club read, or I would not have considered reading a book of this type.<br />Do not allow the length of this book, 548 pgs., hinder you from reading it.  I had a hard time putting<br />the book down.  It was, by far, one of the best books that I have ever read.<br />Looking forward to reading more books by the author!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked once you start watching you just cant stop. I love this show.The characters are so interesting you feel like your part of the family.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Mr. Franco was outstanding as oz. Gave a true sense of how the character came about. Fantastic flick for the whole damn family.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I didn't want to put it down. The only thing I have to say is I hope more levels come out soon!!!! It was fun and helped time pass.
0385523912|5.0|I whipped through this book pretty fast, it was a easy read and very educational. I would highly recommend Nothing to Envy to anyone who is interested in what happened and what IS happening in North Korea.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Not much needs to be said about these movies, save for the last one maybe. Also, the packaging is very neat.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Good story,easy read,fast pace,page turner looking forward to next book in series .Will not review any more books because of # of word requirements.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The first two of these movies are absolute classics. This is a fantastic collection loaded with extra features and the quality is amazing considering the age of the film.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This game definitely has potential. Id like to see some different mission concepts instead of the same air to air fighting. Also maybe use a different look when trying to choose a plane. Instead of a scroll maybe use like an optional grid view so the user can view all planes at once. But other than that the game is entertaining and is fun to play. Easy to unlock new planes and IAP's aren't really needed. Developers did a good job.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|These movies are a staple in my collection. This box set is the Matrix fans best bet, comes with lots of extras.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Fun movie, love story comedy, with a cast of great actress and actors. Betty White as &#34;Gammy&#34; she just adds comedy to a movie. Theme of a Canadian with an expired visa makes movie a bit realistic.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is by far the best thing that my family has come across! We find it a little difficult to unwind at bed time,  and used to need the help of a sleep aid. However, since we found relax melodies we have found THE perfect way to help us relax &amp; forget about or fast paced lives. With the vast amount of ambiance and melodies, each family member can create their own personal compilation of sounds to drift into a sweet slumber with out the need for medication.  It's definitely a win in my book! :)
B00650SSDU|5.0|This movie is funny with a bit of serious topics(changing job situation). What not to like if you like Mila or Justin and Woody(he is a versatile actor).
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I've always loved Mahjong ever since I was a little kid, and this version is just like that one. So many levels, all with different difficulties. Five stars!
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I love this movie!  I have watched it probably 4 times since I first got it and still enjoy it.
B0057GUFXO|3.0|Had trouble playing the disk on Blu-Ray player, it would freeze at different parts. Towards the end it froze completely and had to watch the rest on the DVD copy provided
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|when i play the game and when i touch the colored squares it makes a loud noise that gets on my nerves but i like the game though
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love this game!  I'm not a great facebook fan, so I hate to have one of the requirements being that I need to login and make a request to others to get more hearts to play.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I watch this one over and over.  The very best scene in the movie is when Jimmy Stewart barges into Cary Grant's house late at night - drunk - and rants about his predicament.  If you watch closely, you will see Grant trying hard not to crack up as Stewart ad libs away.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|They got problems, they have different title and hang with different crowds or none at all. Then they get detention on a Saturday and began to get to know one another.<br /><br />This movie makes me want to live in the 80's! Sadly my mother was the one that got that chance... XP
B000ICZD4I|5.0|This movie has aged well, I still enjoy watching it.  Love the twists and turns of the plot, the characterizations, the complementary stories of Evelyn and Idgie...
B00005LC1H|5.0|Customers should be happy with this DVD. Quality met expectations. I enjoyed this product. I recommend this Fawlty<br />Towers DVD .
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, based on a true story, about the Hawaiian girl, Bethany Hamilton, who lost an arm to a white shark and, more importantly, the story of her recovery. Fairly close to the actual story.  Prepare children for the shark attack scene which is pretty intense, although done with a minimal amount of gore.  The DVD has extras about Bethany herself and about the making of the film; the streaming version does not.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is simply beautiful in the deepest sense possible. The game takes you through an enchanting world filled with wonder. It is quite unique; I've never played a game like it. The music is powerful and amazingly well choreographed to the sequences on-screen. It gave me chills of awe, as if I were watching something magical. The Collector's Edition also contains flow and flower, but quite honestly, I feel these two games were really test runs for Journey -- they seem to build upon each other with increasing complexity. The true gem is Journey, and it's no wonder this game is holding its value. It is a timeless masterpiece.
B00336C3EY|4.0|I have watched this a few times, and see more each time.  Being raised Jewish in the 1970s helps one to appreciate the humor.  But it is also is an Everyman tale which crosses cultures and generations.  Highly recommended.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Kind of corny in parts, but excellent overall. I love the John McClain character and Bruce Willis is the best!
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I love Wall-E.  I love that there are few words in the story.  I love Wall-E's purity.  A great parable.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great plot, believable story and excellent acting.  I think Bruce Willis is getting better with age.  The ending really makes you think.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This is a movie that has aged well.  A wonderful cast, including Holly Hunt, George Clooney, and John Goodman.  The parallel with Ulysses is clever if a bit beyond us less well-read viewers.  And the music...!  I did buy the sound track, I love listening to Gillian Welch and Allison Krause since those old-timey songs. A T-bone Burnett masterpiece.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I never realized that Steve was so driven to perfection. I have been an Apple fan since 1989, they are the best computers. This book really goes into the details of Steves life. A great read!
B00C061I3K|5.0|In retrospect this album was destined to go in a new direction. That's how Daft Punk rolls.<br /><br />But only now that I've heard it multiple times, can I truly appreciate that they are trying to plant a stake in the heart of the plateau that EDM and all its splinters have reached. Somehow Daft Punk takes any willing listener to a place that is wholly unexpected; a place that is simultaneously disco retro and truly utterly, zeitgeist-level now. I don't know how they can get such breezy, sweet, funky smoothness out of their tools but they've done it.<br /><br />Now I'll agree that upon first listen your ear is not going to be ready (mine wasn't) and if you only give the album a single listen-through you'll be truly missing out. But after the second listen, you'll pickup two or three more tracks ... then on the third listen the album just clicks and it will \\"click on the 24 track\\". Once you realize that this track is it... the ourobouros... both the beginning and end of the meta-loop of dance music from 1970's Donna Summer to music just before this album came out - then you can head in the new direction. I know this is high-falootin stuff and a rarified comparison, but if you've ever lost yourself to dance I'll bet you'll agree that this album is effectively the Dark Side of the Moon of Dance music.<br /><br />Quick track breakdown:<br />Stand out tracks: Give Life Back to Music, Giorgio by Moroder, Lose Yourself to Dance, Get Lucky, Doin' It Right, Contact<br />Just plain interesting Daft Punk-isms: Touch, Within, Fragments of Time.<br /><br />The final beauty of this whole thing is, if you recall every other album from Daft Punk, _this is just the beginning_. These tracks will find obvious, innocuous, and always compelling ways to be a part of other genres. Then that cross-pollination with the other genres will echo back into these song's remixes and ultimately spread more and more seeds for the continued birth of a new direction for dance.<br /><br />Give this album multiple open listens and you'll see those seeds now and how, by the end of this album, the world of dance music should not, will not, and can not be the same.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Jiro San is a true workaholic.  In Japanese culture, this is admirable; he is a Zen Master-- a Samurai of sushi. The movie follows him and his sons, who have followed in his footsteps, as they live their lives in urban Japan, dedicated to creating the highest quality sushi in the country.
B00AMYX60U|5.0|Gabrielle Aplin became a star overnight in the UK with her cover version of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's \\"Power of Love\\". The song is included on this album, but the rest of the album is original material, and it's very good material indeed, similar to K.T. Tunstall, but Aplin has an original voice.<br /><br />Most of the arrangements err on the side of simplicity, giving plenty of space for Aplin's voice and words. Comparing the EP version of [[ASIN:B006ZUDOQ6 Home]] with the version on this album, the performance is almost identical (at least at the beginning), but the sound is much smoother, polished. It's gorgeous. Aplin's sound is fairly quiet and reflective, but the material is all the more powerful for that.<br /><br />It's wonderful to hear a debut album like this, where the raw talent and personality of an artist like Gabrielle Aplin is nourished, developed and displayed to best effect. This is her voice, not the voice of an overbearing producer. She is 20 years old; she is a talent to watch.
0307744434|5.0|Could not put it down - so lush, beautiful, and absorbing. The perfect summer or vacation read. Made myself slow down so it wouldn't be over so soon...
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Music is directly from the film, including the &#34;dance&#34; numbers and the troops marching through town.  Beautiful music, great for quiet-time, winding-down background, yet strong reminders of the scenes in the film.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I purchased this complete set for my 14 year old Grandaughter....She has watched each one at least 2 times that I know of!!!!!  Knowing her since we are trying to get all the hard copy books, she will continue to have many hours of HP pleasure.....I love the Amazon Prime and the two day shipping, it makes the kids so happy!!!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This is an excellent film.  The new additions in the movie (Azog, Dol Guldur, the White Council, Radagast) greatly enhance the book's story. (Without Azog, this film would not have an antagonist). The film is beautiful to look at, the acting is spot on, and is actually more faithful to the spirit of the book than The Lord of the Rings films were to the books. This movie will be more and more appreciated after we see it in the context of all three Hobbit films. I'm looking forward to the extended editions this fall. Let's hope that Howard Shore's score is greatly expanded in the next two films to include more original themes.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|One of my all time fav Clooney movies. i have watched it at least 5 times. I love the music too.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|I have seen the movie, so I went through the book really quickly.  Think if I was a real intense baseball fan I would have been<br />more interested.
B005H9B44A|5.0|This movie has it all... Humor, romance, mischief, villains, contracted, drama.... It's great. I've seen it countless times. Because of this movie I am now a HUGE marvel comics fan.
B0041KVV8U|2.0|There are way to many snaps and pops on this album. i am playing it on a very fine turntable with a high end cartridge. i have heard that these albums have had some problems and this is another yes there is response. the seller has not responsibility in this matter.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I think these movies are awesome. They look really good on Blu ray, they are grainy in some scenes but I think they are meant to be. Either way this is a great box set and I got it on sale for 25 bucks.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Once I got into the details of the science behind how we have all been manipulated, it was hard to put down.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|A masterpiece of cinema, yet controversial because of parallels between the plot and the early days of L. Ron Hubbard.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix both provide the performances of their careers and their contributions would have been pointless without co-star Amy Adams who is at the top of her game.  Phoenix's performance is all consuming and he plays one of the most menacing protagonists ever captured on celluloid.  Hoffman's character is mischeviously self-important, yet honorable and lovable.  Adams' character is surreptitiously manipulative and controlling. Cinematography is breathtaking.  We haven't seen images this striking in 70mm since Coppola got lost in the jungle and needed twenty five years to edit his way back to civilization.  It's all really very simple - either you make a film worth watching for a billion years, or you don't make anything at all. There is, however, just one small ambiguity.  With Hoffman's, Phoenix's and Adams' characters all writhing around for power, influence, and control by using their respective gifts of persuasion, bathtub chemistry, and covert manipulation, just who, exactly, is The Master?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it's a lot better than the first .... but you can only complete achievements when they are on your level up screen.
B003L7DK74|5.0|This show is hilarious. I love their creative song lyrics. It's just so silly and definitely not to be taken seriously.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Somehow, I actually know this world and the characters...even though they don't exist.  Martin is a great writer.  Imagination on PEDs.
B000002LK1|5.0|this album is a complex album because i guess that the band wanted to sound little bit diffrent from their earliest 80's to the present... this album is a conbination of rock and synthesizers ... in which brings lots of mysteries . this album has good songs such as personal jesus, enjoty the silence, waiting for the night , and others.... THIS ALBUM ROCK'S
B00CATSONE|4.0|Not enough has been said about this genius who without his knowledge we would not have gotten anywhere near the<br />world of science we now benefit from.
0440237688|4.0|I read this for school and I loved it. It was  very different and it made me look at life in a different way after having read this book. It is a great teens book. If you have the chance to read it, do so. Some people didn't like this book as much, though. It is one that is different for everybody but I loved it.<br />It is very thought provoking!<br />Rating: 6.5/10<br />Parental Rating: 13+ (Some things may be scary for younger readers)
0711225176|5.0|This is a great book with insight to Mucha's success and leadership in the beginning of the Art Nouveau movement. I showed this book as part of a presentation in one of my classes as a student and even my teacher who is an Art Historian was impressed with it's content.<br /><br />Would  buy again ;)
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|This movie has a sad undertone--composed of sadness, rooted in many kinds of loneliness and isolation. At the same time, the craving for healing, to unite, to put the shattered pieces together, pieces from the past, to make sense of the present, all those are shown poetically in this movie. It's not a linear movie with a linear message and the kind that are open for linear interpretation. Depending on who you are, you will identify with it differently.<br />The main actor, Michael Fassbender gives a stunning performance throughout. His skill is most evident during the semi-orgy scene, when we see him in the mirror, like a lost child about to cry, for being lost, waiting to be found, trying to break through again and again.<br />The immense inner vacuum he carries is not only his own, people around him also carry similar bags of inner vacuums.<br />A humanistic movie. You will like it.<br />Four star, because one can always improve.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I love it. If your a fan of Leonard Cohen, you will not be disappointed. Press play, pour a drink and lower the lights. I wish I had been at the London concert. I'm so sad I missed his US tour, I doubt he'll tour again.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Personally, I find this to be a really well rounded,well executed album.  Thy hype machine has been rolling on record for a while, but as a QotSA fan since Rated R, I can say this record lived up to it all.
1439102813|5.0|This is a great novel. The author did a fantastic job of writing an engaging story of a person with alzheimers. Her thorough research on the subject matter allows you to believe this character is a real person. Anyone who knows anyone with alzheimers, especially with an early diagnosis should read this book. I could see my mother in it, perhaps understand her thoughts as she has lived with this disease but unable to verbalize them. Even if alzheimers has not touched your life, this novel is an enjoyable read, an easy read but still causes you to think and contemplate. It's emotional at times but never sappy and doesn't romanticize the character or events. And the paragraphs of cancer versus alzheimers is powerful, it still pops into my head every now and then.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Highlighting family values. It is a necessary investment to bring up the kids.<br />Enjoyed the musical.<br /><br />Wish Amazon could have the captions enabled, makes sense if English is not your native tongue.
B0093X805W|5.0|What an amazing storyteller. Even as an adult I live forward to reading more of his work. A good bedtime story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It was what I expected, I have played several games, I downloaded another Solitaire version I like better then this one, but this is okay.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie and I can't wait for the second one! I would definitely recommend it if you like fantasy or action movies.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The ups and downs, the intrigue, the engaging characters keep me wanting more. This season the characters are even more endearing than they seemed in the previous seasons.
B00005Y1UX|4.0|good emo love story, sad at times fun at others, also shows what the power of money can and cant buy, good cast line up and if you pause it at just the right time Demie's rack is pressed up against woody and her nipples look great :P  It also allows you to see some of the common mistakes men make in a relationship as well as mistakes women make. What I like the most is it shows if 2 people are ment for 1 another all the drama doesn't matter in the end, the old cleshay if you love something set it free apply to this movie
B00A4SJ61W|5.0|This is a great movie for parents and kids both, they really don't make enough movies like this which parents and kids can enjoy.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I definitely liked the movie and the twists in this movie. Franco fit the wizard character perfectly. I hope they make another sequel of some sort. Though I don't know if it's possible. The director Sam Raimi was fantastic as almost always. Also nice to see good old Bruce Campbell in it.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I'm sure our technology is more advanced, but it's a good movie regardless.  This is a must see for all.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|In American, we don't teach people to \\"die well.\\"  I've always believed in a life after life and the idea has been debated when the subject of NDE's were introduced into the conversation. Some believe that it's a way for your brain to protect you during death. I choose too believe that it is so much more. I am happy to see a book by a neurosurgeon who experienced it first hand and gives a very cogent and educated analysis of his experience.  The appendixes, written by colleagues who cared for him during his coma, along with his personal research which attempts to prove that NDE's are real,(a concept that he didn't believe in until experiencing it) gives credibility to the many people who have had NDEs.  For me, it was a picture of hope that one day everyone will understand that everything and everyone in our universe is connected. My hope is that as the subject is studied more in depth,we will evolve to a more peaceful, loving, life experience, facing death as the next new adventure rather than just an ending.
B004SBX112|5.0|Great way to pass idle time, like waiting to see your doctor or any situation where you have interruptions & waiting. Best of all a lot of addictive fun. Challenging too. My favorite games.
B00008N6N5|3.0|As for the movie itself it was excellent, but the condition I got it in was not what I paid for. I went to the new category when I went to buy it. The desciption said new still factory sealed, but what i got was a use copy w/ the corners ripped, finger prints on the back of the disc & a scratched off barcode sticker. I don't buy much from websites for fear of this happ<br />ening. After I cleaned the disc I watched it & all it's contents & it was fine. So my anger subsided & I'll remember the company I bought it from & not purchase anything from them again
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first books. Really the only thing I can say is wow.... on to the third book now as I can't put this story down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool it also has a PC version but this is for just playing bean ever it also has great graphics this is not a waste of money it's very good and its up to 0.7.1 great game
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome,it brings life heaven to kids,and reading skills to more people.<br />I think I should I should give this a five.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|The movie was badass, the characters were tough and whopped some ass. Pretty solid story as well. If the real events were nearly as fantastic as te movie it would have been a truly remarkable family to know and deal with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addicting. I love it. I have so much fun, my kids even love it they always what to play it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|* I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review*<br /><br />See that guy - back suit, devlishly handsome? Yeah, the guy getting the blow job from the red lucious redhead in the bathroom stall?<br /> Thats me. The real me. MBF: Me Before Flu<br /><br />Tangled is wickedly naughty, hilariously funny and utterly romantic. It's a definite must read for 2013.<br /><br />Drew Evans is handsome, smart and a real ladies man. He's also a bit of a dick (Hey they are his words, not mine!) Drew is a love them and leave them type of guy, he has a particular set of rules and everything works well. That is until he spots Katherine Brooks from across the room at the hottest nightclub in town. She represents a challenge of a lifetime for Drew, the one girl he CAN'T have, is the one he wants more than anything. You see, Kate is engaged. No, thats not what stops Drew, engagement is merely a small hurdle. Its the fact that she works at the same Investment Banking firm that Drew does. You see, Drew never shits where he eats (again, his words!), Ever..<br /><br />Kate Brooks is officially scratched off my list of potentials. She is forbidden, untouchable, a no-way-never. Right next to my friends ex-girlfriends, the boss's daughter, and my sister's best friend. Well, that last one is a bit of a grey area. When I was eighteen, Alexandra's best friend, Cheryl Phillips, spent the summer at our house. God bless her - that girl had a mouth like a hoover vacuum.<br /><br />Drew is crude, rude and unabashed. Yet, there is something so likeable about him, I too, fell for his charms. He tells it like it is, and as a reader you get the full, unabridged version. We get all the sordid details that goes on in a mans head, and frankly its quite scary at times. Drew talks directy to the reader, and we are right there in the front seat along for the ride. I was laughing so had throughout the book, Ive hihglighted almost the whole book!<br /><br />For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don't make the mistake of thinking he's so into you, he's already thinking up pet names.<br /><br />It's because he can't or doesn't care to remember your actual name.\\"<br /><br />The story follows the FRD (Flu Ridden Drew) as he tells the reader the story of how he came down with the 'Flu', we then come back to present day and continue along the rollercoaster ride. This is essentailly a story of a Playboy who has met his match, and fallen in love, for the first time. Kate Brooks is such a strong female character, I wanted to high five her on many occassions. She smart, confident, sexy, sassy and driven. Kate goes toe-to-toe with Drew on everything, their banter, although hilarious is also dripping with sexual tension. You just sit back, take cover and wait for the volcano to explode. And it does, and its EPIC! The sex scenes, (Fans Self) wow, credit where credit is due, The boy has moves.<br /><br />\\"God! Oh God!\\"<br /><br />I smile as I pick up the pace, \\"God's not the one f#@*ing you, baby.\\"<br /><br />Sure, I'm in love, but this is still me here.<br /><br />\\"Drew...Drew...yes...Drew!\\"<br /><br />Much better.\\"<br /><br />I loved every page of this book. I laughed so much, I swooned, I cried (from the laughter..) It was such an enjoyable read. I loved Emma's writing style, it was fresh and contemporary. Yes it is similar to Wallbanger, but the fact that its from Drew's POV makes it more interesting, being inside a guys head, yeesh! I highly recommend this as your next read.ning, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment?

B004EPYZUS|5.0|I love the M:I movies, and was able to add this movie to my collection. Great film/series and was so happy to get this in the mail!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|\\"From the moment I first saw him-- saw through his stunning and impossibly gorgeous exterior to the dark and dangerous man inside-- I'd felt the pull that came from finding the other half of myself. I needed him like I needed my heart to beat, and he'd put himself in great jeopardy, risking everything-- for me.\\"<br /><br />What a great installment to a much loved series. There is so much to experience in one book, so many emotions to be felt, and of course, so many plot twists to poke a stick at.<br /><br />Entwined with You picks up directly where Reflected in You leaves us. Eva has just learned the truth about what Gideon has done for her and she begins to understand the depth of his love for her. But there are so many issues ahead of them, the first being the investigation into Nathan's death. They can't just come back together, it would be too suspicious. So we travel along the journey of them, slowly coming back together in the public eye. And along the way we cross paths with some old foes and some new ones as well. Brett is still trying to win his way back into Eva's heart, Corrine can't and won't take no for an answer, there are detectives still sniffing about, throw in a snoopy reporter and a Russian mobster and you've got a recipe for success.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br /><br />I've always had mixed emotions about this series. I enjoyed the plot twists but  I didnt quite feel the pull between the characters, didn't fully understand just how damaged they each were. I would just see Gideon shut down, and push Eva away, and she'd retaliate by running. That is a pet peeve of mine. Doing a runner instead of stopping and asking questions.. It's called communicating people, look it up. I don't like how by simply not asking questions, characters go along miserably for weeks, months, even years ( no word of a lie, I read a book in which the Hero/Heroine were seperated for 5 years because of a simple misunderstading).<br /><br />This time round, we've seen Gideon and Eva go through hell to get back to one another and it changes you. I finally understand the depth of love they feel for one another. They need each other like they need air to breathe, they feel incomplete without the other around, they can sense one another. Knowing that Gideon would to those length for Eva, that sealed the deal for me, it was my lightbulb moment. I can see clearly now.<br /><br />There were more moments of just Ace & Angel, spending time together, COMMUNICATING, enjoying each other immensely. They are adorable and funny together. I loved seeing the playful Gideon.<br /><br />\\"...he murmured. \\"Of course, you're my favorite ride.\\"<br /> \\"Aw, that's sweet, baby. And you're my favorite joystick.\\"<br /><br />Let's not forget about what Gideon and Eva always had going for them, sex. There's lots of it in this book, and its everywhere, and its hot. I also think there was much more emotion in each encounter, it didn't just feel like two sex crazed fiends (I can think of 2 particular scenes that really moved me, and one takes place on a plane). These were two people that NEEDED to be entwined, needed to connect with each other to be able to live each day. I was consistently moved by the depth of love they shared, I got a little misty eyed.<br /><br />\\"Gideon cupped my face in his hands and kissed me, our flavors mingling. \\"Thank you.\\"<br /> \\"What are you thanking me for? You did all the work.\\"<br /> \\"There's no work involved in f#$@ing you, angel.\\" His slow smile was pure satiated male.<br /> \\"I'm grateful for the privilege.\\"<br /> I sank back onto my heels. \\"You're killing me. You can't be that gorgeous and sexy and say stuff like that. It's overload. It fries my brain. Sends me intoa meltdown.\\"<br /> His smile widened and he kissed me again. \\"I know the feeling.\\"<br /><br />The story finishes at a satisfying point, but it's also an excellent segue into the next story. Gideon and Eva still have a lot more obstacles ahead of them, but we've learnt that Ace & Angel can take on anything, as long as they are together.a meltdown.\\"<br /> His smile widened and he kissed me again. \\"I know the feeling.\\"<br /><br />The story finishes at a satisfying point, but it's also an excellent segue into the next story.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is awesome. I first used the free one with fewer sounds, then saw this one for free app of the day. Wow. It's amazing. I mix some sounds together, set the timer for five minutes, and I'm asleep.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is a great game, especially for a free game. The single player isn't very fun, but the online definitely makes up for it. Is runs really smoothly on a stable internet connection and has pretty good graphics. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have enough game modes and maps (there are only two different modes and five maps). It would also be nice to be able to customize your character. So I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, but don't expect good single player gameplay.

B00BXHLM1K|2.0|The 2013 RIGOLETTO, set in the Vegas of the Rat Pack era, was the opera debut of another in Met GM Peter Gelb's long line of distinguished non-opera directors. Once in a while there is a bit of stage business devised by Michael Mayer that suggests someone who does good work in his own milieu, for example, the hitman casually jotting his name on a matchbook while singing, and insistently pressing it into Rig's hand. But for all the ink spilled on the production's outrageousness (by those who hated it) and its innovations (mostly by those trying to sell tickets to it), this is essentially a cosmetic update. It puts a lot of bright color and \\"novelty\\" in front of us, and there is an air of self-satisfaction about it just for that. But it brings no special insight or point of view to the work, as real Regietheater is supposed to do. It is a busy traditional RIGOLETTO with different kinds of detritus in everyone's way.<br /><br />No one sounds particularly good (is this set an acoustic challenge, perhaps? Or was it just February cold season in New York?), and conductor Michele Mariotti is a klutz, making no better an impression with a great orchestra than he has in the past with a poor one (PURITANI from Bologna). His fast tempi are very fast, which is fine, but he simply lets the music tumble out shapelessly, leaving the singers to snatch breaths where they can. The result is almost anti-phrasing, and no matter how they are caricatured by their harshest critics, Toscanini and Muti did not lead performances of Italian opera this way. I was wincing even in the rapid-fire exchanges before \\"Questa o quella,\\" and matters did not improve. I doubt even native Italian speakers could make much of the words with such graceless leadership; this international cast is at sea.<br /><br />Zeljko Lucic (Rigoletto) and Diana Damrau (Gilda) have appeared previously in these roles in a 2008 DVD performance from Dresden conducted by Fabio Luisi, the production (also in modern dress) by Nikolaus Lehnhoff. Their Duke was Juan Diego Flórez. That performance is urgently recommended above this one. Lucic's blustery, unfocused singing at the Met is a liability. In his present state, he has the technical shortcomings of Tito Gobbi in this music (a constricted, hooded top and a flinty basic sound), but without the stylistic and expressive resources. Piotr Beczala has never looked better than in the Duke's white tux, but he has sung better, even at the Met (LUCIA, MANON). Stefan Kocan also looks great in the clothes, but his ubiquity in bass roles at the Met is hard to understand. The sound is lightweight for much of what is thrown his way, and he is not a special actor or interpreter, just a good-looking man with a pleasant timbre. For its previous video release of RIGOLETTO (1977), the Met could field Isola Jones for Maddalena and John Cheek for Monterone. Their 2013 counterparts are adequate and poor, respectively.<br /><br />Damrau merits slightly more extended discussion. Having recently given birth, she is heavier than usual and is undermined by costumes that are not as concealing as they could be. She is slow to warm up vocally, and does not sound close to a representative form until the opera's second half (the first father/daughter duet and \\"Caro nome\\" go for little...not the case in Dresden '08). But one thing must be said on her behalf: she understands this character. She gets things right that I believe owe less to Michael Mayer's direction than to experience and sympathy with the role of Gilda. There is a tragic ambiguity to Gilda's view of the Duke, and even when she realizes he is a cad, she carries feelings for him that she understands as love. She has given something of herself to him, and it is a payment the truth cannot refund to her. In the hands of someone who acts the part sensitively, Gilda is a very touching character, not an annoying or insipid one. On that part of the assignment, Damrau delivers.<br /><br />Another of Mayer's bits that I liked was Gilda's smelling the Duke's jacket while Rigoletto rages after his daughter's attack. This is eloquent and tasteful, and there are other such little moments in the margins, such as the direction of Marullo (ashamed) in the pleading episode of Rigoletto's big scene with the courtiers. Peter Gelb has been loyal to directors (giving Bartlett Sher and Mary Zimmerman chance after chance, despite their misfires); perhaps Mayer will be more on target the second time. More subtlety, less gimmickry, please.<br /><br />In truth, the best vocal performance is Met mezzo stalwart Maria Zifchak's deft Giovanna (in beehive). With all considerable due respect to Ms. Zifchak, this is not good news.<br /><br />The English subtitles are irritatingly updated to a '60s colloquial style of speaking (\\"doll\\" and \\"big shot\\" and \\"rubbed out\\" and so on). They frequently have only a handshake acquaintance with the text, and they are tin-eared overkill.<br /><br />While not a disaster, this was a \\"C\\"-grade afternoon for the Met, neither the best work of anyone involved nor an HD broadcast I will want to revisit. For all the bright lights on the stage, there is precious little in the way of illumination.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|I'm not much of a game player, but I like this game.  It's not too fast for me to be able to use.  And I think my 5 yr old granddaughter will be able to use it too.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I watched Warm Bodies tonight with my grandson, who had already seen it. I saw the previews in the theater, too, but hadn't been able to see the flick till now.<br /><br />Fun, quirky, and very unique version of a happy-ending Romeo & Juliet meets the Zombies. John Malkovich was great in his brief appearances as the city leader whose daughter Julie was part of the group sent 'outside' for medications. Her boyfriend Perry is attacked & killed on their mission by 'R', who eats Perry's brains & gathers his memories. R takes Julie with him & keeps her safe, inadvertently beginning the process of 'reviving' himself. Picture a 100th monkey effect & there you have it.<br /><br />Will likely watch it one more time before the rental period's up.

B00COGXX7A|4.0|Yes it contains all your &#34;typical&#34; chick flick elements. But I still bought in to the story and it was a great heart-warming two hours :-)
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is an epic in super hero movies.The story line is amazing, drawing some elements from Batman the Long Halloween and even some themes from the Killing Joke. The action and effects in the movie were terrific. The movie was more intense than its predecessor- Batman Begins. The acting was superb especially by Heath Ledger as the Joker. The introduction of the bat-pod was very awesome to see. I also found it quite interesting how Two-Face played his part in the story line. Hans Zimmer's music score was great and made moments in the movie even better.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. I can't wait til the next book. So much drama in one relationship. Loved it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Amazing movie filled with great effects, action and acting, along with a great story. I'm a Superman comic fan, and I enjoyed the way Kal-El was portrayed. Best superhero action in a movie yet as well, I loved the fight between Kal-El and Zod, it was very intense. The actors all fit their roles very good, and did a very good job in the film.

B00AHDXTIK|5.0|This one's quite versatile considering its length. I usually find the 3-feet cables quite limiting especially if the sockets are not within an arm's reach. And among the 3rd party 3-meter lightning cables, this one's the most durable!
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|This book (I purchased the kindle edition) is a primer, an introduction to aquaponics, and does not pretend to anything more. In other reviews I reasoned complaint was about how the author pushes her aquaponics kits and web site. Yes there are links in this book, but they are not intrusive. also, while most of the information in this book can be found on the Internet the author has added structure and a bit of humor. So for me this was an excellent introduction to an interesting hobby and perhaps a future vocation.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|this blade is something else... it can take a beating and keep going!  1095 high carbon steel, full tang, ensures that your blade stays sharp and wont break (i've used this knife as a pry bar several times and all i got is a few scratches).  If you are looking for an affordable blade with the qualities of the high dollar products, do yourself a favor... and buy this!  I couldnt be happier
B009KY5OGC|5.0|This book is an eye opener. For those of us raised on patriotic stories of well meaning white people and dishonest Indians, this book will change everything. Over the years we have come to understand that our previous views of American Indians were wrong, but this lists those wrongs and more importantly it remembers great native Americans whose names should be remembered. It becomes apparent from the start of this book that the American Indians merely wanted their land...or even a small part of it. That they tried to comply and took far more abuse and dishonest dealings than any white American would have taken. This book covers each tragic tale and you see the repeated plea of great and failing Indian chiefs who are trying to save their people from annihilation. I love a non-fiction book where I can find new heroes to read about. This book provides a plethora of heroes, who were instead regarded as criminals by the US. Sadly, these heroes do not triumph in the end. This book captures their vain and valiant attempts to save their people and ultimately chronicles the end of the great American Indian nations.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's Indiana Jones, all in one set, in HD.  I'm one of the minority that actually liked Crystal Skull, so for me, the only minor gripe I could have is the packaging; since I got it during the Gold Box special, I can't even really complain about that.  Well, I can, but it'd be petty.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|The songs are great But the recording sounds like its in Mono... This CD needs to be re-recorded.. Fire your recording studio..
B009K916ZK|5.0|This adapter functions great!<br />Occasionally you have convince the laptop software and the TV motherboard to work with you.  It seems silly that completely unplugging the TV from the wall outlet and then powering back on would help the computer detect it properly, but that's what worked.  Yes, as the others said, you may have to go into System Preferences afterwards to adjust settings for both display and audio.  Details are below:<br /><br />Display:<br />I have a Macbook Pro early 2011 with a thunderbolt port.<br />1) Display #1 - small Polaroid TV.  The MacBook Pro detected the display, and an image appeared but it was not centered.  I still had to go to System Preferences -> Display -> Detect display for it to get the CORRECT settings and center the image on the screen.  An additional window appears that allows one to adjust the Polaroid's settings.<br /><br />2) Display #2 - 32\\" RCA TV.  The Macbook Pro detected another display, but no image came up on the TV, and Detect display did not improve the matter.  An additional window did appear to adjust the RCA image settings, but I chose the wrong one and it was \\"unsupported\\" by the TV.<br />I had to UNPLUG the TV (not the computer) completely from the wall and wait ~ 20 seconds before plugging it back in and turning it back on.  I did this while the VGA cable was still connected to both the laptop and the TV.  (Note:  merely powering off the TV from the remote does not force a reboot of the TV's motherboard.)<br /><br />Then the display was successfully detected by the laptop at the proper settings.  Using the separate window for adjusting the additional display, I could only go one screen size higher than the auto-detected setting, since any larger was \\"unsupported\\" by the TV set.  (Note:  Make note of the Hz settings on the default before trying any further settings, or the images on both the laptop and the TV may be unreadable.)<br /><br />Regarding Audio:  Sound is not supported through the VGA port.  Use an additional 1/8\\" (3.5 mm) sound cable and connect it to both the headphone port on the laptop and the sound port next to the VGA plug on the TV set.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is the very best game I've played in a while. Lots of action and constantly changing. There are multiple levels to conquer.
B000001GXL|5.0|By far - the best performance of these two concertos I've ever heard. I would have loved to give it a sixth star.

B005LAIHYU|3.0|If you think movies are made to be enjoyed as action festivals, and thinking is not overly necessary, then this is a film for you. If you have any desires in the way of cerebral movie making, go elsewhere...this is a silly movie that counts on the fact that you'll go for its funny premise, and then it pretty much depends upon stunts and slight historical tie-ins to provide the remaining humor (Alan Tudyk of [[ASIN:B000I9X6NG Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]] as Stephen A. Douglas, for instance).<br /><br />We meet Honest Abe when he witnesses the death of his mother -- of course at the hands of vampire Jack Barts, portrayed by Marton Csokas ([[ASIN:B007ZQAKHU The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]]]). This brings about one of the film's conceits: that slave owners are actually vampires, spawned by a vampire named, of course, Adam, played by Rufus Sewell ([[ASIN:B008G87K74 Dark City]], [[ASIN:B008Y7DKK8 A Knight's Tale]]) an evil slave owner whom Abe stopped from whipping up on a slave named William Johnson. From then on he battles them, though for the large part of the early film he is the only one who sees them. His tutor in this endeavor is a man named Henry Sturges, played by Dominic Cooper ([[ASIN:B0095P33IW Captain America: The First Avenger]]). Naturally, Abe's weapon of choice is -- of course -- an ax? And one with a rifle inside of it.<br /><br />To relate more of the plot is to endeavor in foolish details, but suffice it to say that Abe not only goes on to be POTUS, bu he also leads the Civil War campaign against the South in order to ride the country of vampires...AKA slave owners. Here's where I found the premise to be a little wonky and maybe just a tad offensive; to me, it signified that America's slave owners can be excused from their actions by telling us they were inhabited by demons. Yes, it's just a comedy, but I found this to be pretty rank.<br /><br />What takes place throughout this movie is all cinematic play: stop-action violence where axes and bullets and teeth are all bared in their glory for the sake of the audience. Lest you find yourself taking this too seriously, Abe not only chases the bad guys by literally running along the backs of stampeding horses, but our vampire actually grabs one of the horses by its hoof and swings the horse itself at Abe's head.<br /><br />The vampires have impossibly wide mouths and teeth like stalactites, and they move with a visual flurry that begs even the most forgiving minds. Leaps are not enough: the vampire springs off, grabs a chair, flips it mid-leap, then lands upon its attacker with the legs of the chair pinning their limbs. Such rampant visual imagery is meant to fill the screen with action, but it tends to numb the viewer, as do the constant \\"deaths-that-aren't-deaths\\" as the profligate vampires go on and on in their almost endless fights.<br /><br />That notwithstanding, ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER is a silly movie that at times tries to dress up in serious clothes, and while it is never outside being tongue-in-cheek, I found it too silly to be serious, and too serious to be funny.<br /><br />It's like going to a Chuck E. Cheese and meeting Daniel Day Lewis... it's just incongruous.ts and teeth are all bared in their glory for the sake of the audience.

B007KUFDBY|5.0|Awesome show about space travel with cool characters. Cartoons expands your imagination to me. So many people knock cartoon and I have no ideal why. Guess they don't get it or think they are for children only when in fact the theme in most of the cartoons are for adults. Pick this up if you enjoy cool characters and space travel. You won't be dissappointed. I recommend this item.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard great things about this book, so was eager to read it. Maybe my expectations were too high. It's certainly a page-turner, but somewhat disappointing overall.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Awesome Puss in Boots. If you enjoy any Schrek movie, this one is excellent as well. You won't be dissappointed. I recommend this item.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|All of the cars and tracks cost to many coins. But very addictive,very fun. Thank you for making it free.
B001HN697M|5.0|good movie i always love underworld movies it ir now part of my collection i am please with the service and the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will keep you guessing.  It is very addicting and hard to put down.  It keeps my kids busy when out and about.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book as I do all of Nicholas Sparks books. I really enjoyed reading it on my Kindle Fire. The story was very easy to follow and really kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down. The ending was absolutely fantastic and was not expecting the surprise at the end. I hope he keeps writing more like this, but don't let them make a film out of it. The movies that have been made from his books are not good and leaves so much out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We loved Downton Abbey. Never saw it on TV, but heard so much about it, we had to see it and it was all that was expected.  Awesome.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a great book and I could visually picture images in my head just like the movie. Overall a great book, definitely recommend to any age.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Great in tune writing, love the two companion movies, looking forward to the next edition. I would think most adults could relate to this dialogue.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I don't live on it,  but it's a lot of fun. Getting insightful comments from people you admire as well as staying in<br />touch with loved ones. Great time killer when waiting.
B001NA6096|5.0|The dialogue was so interesting and held my attention. Bravo to this writer, I looked for his next, Before Sunset,just as interesting!
B002WCLG48|5.0|Best movie I've seen since, well, ANY movie! It brings out different sides of stories and reveals more coverage of the Halo universe than what you already know! 5 stars is a good rating.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Much like the earlier series, a great deal of the show focuses on the character development of the noble employers and their servants.  Often the interdependence of the servants and nobility is a backdrop or focus of an episode.  The ways the nobility and the servants interact point out that neither can really live well without the other.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I love the mixture of comedy and 'ole' fashion goodness!  We truly enjoyed this movie!  Would definitely recommend it for family viewing!
B005S9ELVC|4.0|This movie was great. I don't know why the critics gave it such a bad review because this movie was very clear about everything that happened in L.A. during Cohen's rise to power. Everyone is great in this movie especially Sean Penn who was awesome as Mickey Cohen and with the makeup and the voice, he was one of two actors who brought Cohen back to life the other being Harvey Keitel in the movie \\"Bugsy\\".
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|My family has always enjoyed the Wizard of Oz story, so when my wife suggested we rent this feature, I was game.  The story was well thought out & entertaining, but we ponied up for the HD version & I wasn't wowed by the clarity like I typically am on our LED tv.<br /><br />Still a very entertaining film.
B003DT194G|5.0|This movie has got to be one of the greatest westerns of all time. Although it was long, it was still a very enjoying movie with all the western action, the direction of the late great Sergio Leone, four great actors Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale and especially the musical genius of Ennio Morricone who has made the most memorable music of all time including the songs in here.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Love every minute of this cd!!  Just like DM I grew up listening to.  Play it non-stop in my car.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The casting was just about perfect, in my opinion. Everything was simply wonderful and it is one of the few movies I watch again and again over the years.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|This app is great, but it could use more weapons. It's got enough guns to satisfy my wants, but it could use a good amount more.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is beast its vast and has many ways of getting you what you want its really good and very fun
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this cd.  I had been listening to Bon Jovi radio on XM and new it was a 10.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|It's never changed since the beginning. A true artest just knows how to write a song. Sara carries the torch like Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Shawn Colvin, Sarah McLachlan. What a beautiful voice. Why isn't she singing the National Anthem at big sporting events?
B005JTAP4S|5.0|It is a great story of a boy who takes an amazing journey into a beautifully described magical land. The characters he meets are visually described so clearly that I want to see this made into a movie so I can see the visual beauty William describes. What a great trip I took with Peter, the boy. LOVED how easy it was to read and see everything Peter did.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Boy am I glad they digitally re-mastered this one.  It's hard to believe I loved this album when it first came out even though most of it was inaudible.  Everybody should have this album.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Strong cast and superb writing give this movie everything it needs plus that added something for a very heartwarming and entertaining film.  Casting was perfect and the story was enlightening especially if you are a parent of a grown child.
B0073XORCY|2.0|I thought it might be the continuing saga of little what's-his-name in the same musical vein, so I eagerly bought it.  As it turns out, it's not.  Even the musicians (save Ian) are different and that tight, together, Jethro Tull sound is totally absent.  So it's an ode to Ian Anderson.  Not what I bargained for.  Sad really.
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|I good family night film. My fiance and I watch this for our movie night last week, we both enjoyed the light hearted action and adventure.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Interesting how norms are not the norm in this movie. Open minded. Funny to see the dynamics play out with his horrible mother
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Mason tells it like he felt it. From start to finish a refreshing view of a difficult time.  Mental toughness vs a raging war.
0425263924|5.0|I have absolutely fallen in love with Gideon Cross.  I couldn't turn the page fast enough.  I read books 1 and 2 over a weekend last November and have counted the months down to book 3. I read this one in 2 days.  I stretched it out as long as I could.  I'm thinking of going back and re-reading the series!
0307477479|3.0|Each chapter was written in a new voice that followed a different character whose story was woven into the overarching life story of the two \\"main\\" characters. The round about story telling provided a unique and interesting way to discover how people grow and change and how time affects us all. While I appreciated the author's ability to switch voices and create many short stories that together told one big story, I was never really hooked or all that interested, and often felt like putting it down. The only reason I pushed to finish this book was because I was reading it with a book club. I am glad that I finished, it is much better as a whole, but it took a lot of effort to get there. The characters introduced often felt flat and too archetypal, and I had a hard time caring about most of them.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved watching Daria growing up and this was hands-down one of the best purchases I have made / one of the best series that I have invested in. Just as funny as when originally aired by in the 90s!<br />A cult classic!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i lovd this game its a great way to pass time. i havent beat the whole game but i love it so far
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I really loved this book, although sometimes it could be hard to understand. Many a time I put down my Kindle and I sat on my bed and I thought; I had to wait until it clicked. Sometimes I couldn't even decipher what the author was trying to tell me or explain, and I almost screamed in frustration. I really loved When You Reach Me, as well, for a number of reasons. I loved how the author lulled me through a series of events and left the littlest details out of the picture, only to say them later and have me kick myself.  This book left me feeling happy, sad, and really confused, all at the same time. I quote, \\"My brain screamed, `THIS IS CRAZY! HOW COULD IT BE REAL?` But it was all true.\\"  This book really opened my eyes and made me think harder about the possibilities of time travel, and the mysteries it possesses. I give this book five stars! -Stephanie's 11 year-old daughter, Meg
1451695195|3.0|I was a little disappointed in that I was hoping for some more insights he received when he was in the spirit world. There were a few, but he seemed to focus in on wanting to prove the scientific nature of what happened to him. I suppose that's because he comes from the medical world where everything is based on science and facts. I did enjoy the few messages he received, just wish he would have gone into more detail about why things are the way they are on earth.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I love this CD the sound is like being in concert.!  I will be ordering more of the same this is a good CD
B0050O7VAI|5.0|this TV series is the best scifi story yet,..it has drama, action, and cool F/X....i have missed the last 2 seasons but thankfully for dvd's i have caught up with this series...I have given a 5 star rating because i like this tv series...and i enjoy scifi stories such as this....if you get chance i suggest getting this 1st season and catch up the way i did!...jp
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I really liked this movie with so much climactic array of twists and turns which gets you ready for the final 2 films of the series. Love Harry Potter!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|kept putting this off because I wastch too much TV, but finally started watching and ended up watching 2 season within a week
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Im so happy they finally came out with this app for my kindle fire. The app is just as good as it would be on any other device.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This is a really great film, but this is in no way a film for young children.  It gets pretty graphic, but it is a great film.<br /><br />There are some funny things in this, kind of in the sense of being sarcastic toward the story.  Overall, I really enjoyed this one, with the exception of some of the graphics, but I will watch it again.  There are lots of hidden things in this, that reveal themselves the more you see it.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|One of the best kids movies I have watched with my girls.  My husband and I loved it when we were kids and it is still just as much fun to watch.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I have watched this one several times now and it just keeps getting better.  Even my husband likes it and he never likes anything.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one, especially for kids.
B006G8WD78|5.0|Couldn't believe the performances in this recording. Just returned from seeing Nabucco in Prague and these performances do justice to a wonderful opera.
B004529NKM|5.0|I just love this series, but I have to say, this one and &#34;Revolution&#34; are my all time favorites of the series.  I have watched these films over and over again, never getting tired of them.<br /><br />The dancing is just incredible.<br /><br />The kid that plays &#34;Moose&#34;.... I could watch him dance day and night.  He is an unbelievable dancer!!
B005SAZI9A|5.0|If you liked Moonrsie Kingdom, you will probably like this movie as well. But, because of some of the subject matter it would notbe appropriate for younger viewers.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like it!  Can put as many alarms as needed and put music in too.  Weather and temps is nice too.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|Room in Rome is so beautifully shot that one could see the film without sound and still enjoy it.  The relationship is realistic and heartfelt. But again the cinematography is king!  Director Julio Medem, who also directed Lucia y el Sexo, manages to do what American directors are incapable of...to film a realistic film about an adult relationship.  The sex is never exploitative. Every frame is in the film for a reason. Excellent.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This was a wonderful treat! Rod seems to be back in action again with another great selection of music and his voice sounds better than ever!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love to shop. Especially at Amazon. It's good to have an app that lets you good straight to it. You can access any department and shop to your hearts content.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|This has been on my wish list for several years and finally it's here. I think it's a great CD and great contrubution to the Fleetwood Mac library as well as a great contrubution to music in American Pop culture.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I like adobe and have used it many times. It's good for so many of the apps you have installed.  It loaded great for me and you definitely need it.
0399165274|3.0|I've enjoyed Forsyth's writing over the years and \\"The Kill List\\" is no exception.  It's a high tech military tale about hunting down the bad guys...terrorists.  It's strong on insider knowledge about the military, high tech espionage, and terrorist thinking.  It's short on characterization which is the book's biggest weakness.  Forsyth doesn't flesh out any of his protagonists.  They all remain one dimensional but if you're looking for a fast moving, up to date political story look no further.  I have little knowledge about such topics so I'm not a good judge but the story is all too believable.  Drones that can track and kill as well as surveil.  Highly trained military personnel who are excellent killing machines.  Terrorists who will stop at nothing to destroy their enemies.  Governments who are as involved in gamesmanship as they are with the safeguarding of their populations.  It's chilling.  It rings true to life.  It's frightening how thin the line is between the supposed good guys and the supposed bad guys.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|If you are a Barbra fan, this is for you. She blends so well in all her duets. The partners she has picked not only make her sound good but also brings out the good sounds of her duet partners. A definite must have.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Wish I could give this a good rating, however, it was stolen from my porch. Will have to let you know later.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I felt it wasn't as good as the first.  It was good but the movie trailors had most of the best parts in it.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|really love this movie although wish by now they re release it in blu ray so I can see in hd
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I believe this is one of her best collections ever!  We love Rhianna!I suggest everyone has this in their cd player!
B004NELBPC|4.0|I like the articles, don't really like the layout, it is actually better on the Blackberry app.  Very good news.
0425166805|5.0|I had loaned out another book like this years ago and never received it back and it is such a good book that I decided to order a new one to replace the one I never got back.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|This was not a good use of my time or money.  I was so hopeful.  I should have paid attention to the ratings and other reviews.  Very glossy though, so if you have it on during a party with no sound you might enjoy it as back ground eye candy.  If they had went for a comic book telling of a real life scenario/event it would have been better.  Perhaps that was their angle and I missed that.  If I didn't know these individual's could act I would think that was the problem, as well as the writing.  Yuck.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Just a great movie plain and simple. Some adult content and language but still a great movie.  Check it out.
193700788X|4.0|This is the last one, everyone knows this I suppose.  She finished a lot of story lines and answered a lot of questions.  It was well worth it, if sad to see it all end.  At least I still have True Blood, the TV show.  I have loaned the book out to my friends who didn't want to wait for the library &#34;line&#34; to get to their turn.  I now have my own waiting line.
B0080K3J7S|4.0|An eclectic mix of subject matter guarantees you wont be bored. The origins of the electronic computer as we know it played out against the backdrop of WW2. Mix in a really substantial treasure consisting of more gold than you can handle. Add a few modern day Priates in the guise of banksters, the emergence of a new economic sector ie. the Asia Pacific.<br />You will enjoy this more if you know why someone would want to use obscure versions of Linux and Unix..browse a few snippits of source code.....All in all a good read with a few surprising observations dating back to WW2 !
B003QO8TOQ|3.0|Of all the MI movies, the first and fourth ones were my favorite.  The second and third ones were too much like the Bond movies for me.  Lets examine this one.  The premise is simple; a group of rogue intelligence agents steal a biological agent and want to use it to make money.  In the process of executing their plan, they run up against Ethan Hunt and his ensemble cast of agents.  As the two sides fight of against each other, we see cool gadgets being used, surreal gunfights that result in minimal bloodshed, knockout fistfights that leave no bruises and affects no hairlines, and of course the gorgeous babe that used to the bad guy's girl but who switches allegiance to the good guys.  Sounds like the typical James Bond film.  Now that we have that comparison out of the way, we can try and judge the movie on its merits.  The acting was typical of a Tom Cruise movie; believable but not great.  The dialogue was realistic but not captivating.  The special effects were good, but not mesmerizing.  The action scenes mixed half-speed and full-speed scenes, all of which looked overly choreographed to be real.  And the soundtrack; it sounded the same as all the other MI movies.  Overall, an entertaining but not great film.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Really enjoyed the story line and how much it mimicked with Wizard of Oz when it came to special effects.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|One day my phone was MIA and I needed an alarm to wake me for work. Lucky for me this app was out . Thanks Apalon for making it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am glad that thus app was free because I f finished all levels in one setting. I would really like to see more levels.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is so much fun ... u gotta try it. It'll keep you coming back just to complete each room
B00001X591|5.0|I Want to tell you: This is the very first ever complete recirding on period instruments. But some of these concert for Oboe is recording in the past on period instrument. Not a Complete op. 9. Only on modern instrument, before this. I must say that this is my favorite recording of op. 9
B000ZOW96Y|2.0|A constant parade of well dressed stars doing things that are completely impossible.  I guess if you really like these actors enough to overlook any sort of realism whatsoever it might be OK.  I literally could not make it through and fell asleep in the theater.  There is only one other movie that put me to sleep, Sleepless in Seattle, LOL.  I think if I was a woman I would have liked it better but my wife said it was stupid too.  But at least she stayed away.  I probably would have too if there was a movie full of beautiful women.  Even if that movie sucked like this one I at least would have stayed awake.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie has several surprises in it ... not the least of which is Denzel Washington's superb acting. I highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The only downside to this game is how reliable it is on the diamonds. It takes a little while to get them for free and buying 20 for $1.99 doesn't get you far at all.
B003K16P50|5.0|Based on what I'd read about the narrative style--i.e., taking the form of reports, emails, diaries, etc.--I wasn't sure I was going to like this book.  But I was hooked almost from page one and thought the jumps from one style to another worked well to move the plot along.  The characters were very well drawn, it's got an engaging storyline (a dullish fisheries scientist is asked to help devise a plan to establish salmon fishing in the desert in Yemen), and it satirically includes a lot of bureaucratic maneuvering and inane office politics that anyone who's worked in just about any kind of business can identify with.  I was disappointed in the ending, but on reflection, it probably had to end in that or a similar way.  Really enjoyed this book.

B004YW4L5K|4.0|An interesting spin on the state of religious icons, born from humanity throughout history, twisted up with a bit of a mystery and relatable hero.
B008Y5OW20|3.0|&#34;Timeless&#34; Jeff Lynne is not.  ELO 2,3, and 4 (Eldorado) come very close.  You can actually listen to those albums today and not get a complete 70's buzzz.  However has later stuff screams &#34;dated&#34; and hack and that's including his production ideas.  His decline started right after &#34;New World Record&#34; and he has NEVER recovered.  This CD of covers of other people's songs ain't terrible and maybe 1 or 2 songs are actually interesting. &#34;She&#34; is nice if as always with Lynne very heavy footed.  Some reviewer once said of &#34;Mr. Blue Sky&#34; when that song came out: &#34;Instead of a flight through the cosmos we now get from ELO a tramp through the Iron Works.&#34;  That's as close as anybody has come to explaining what has happened to Jeff Lynne. And it's spot on!
0142410373|5.0|I was looking for books for my teen to read & came across this writer.  Needless to say the books were delivered to me very quickly & in excellent shape.  Would recommend to all.
1401324649|4.0|Love this book and even though it is fiction and far fetched - it all sort of hangs together. Excellent book.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Just like the other two CDs I have of his, this is full of wonderful, thoughtful songs.  Am enjoying it very much.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I don't remember ever having any information about orphan trains before.  I would have thought  something would have been taught in history classes during my school years.  Would read again.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So good.  I'm waiting for third book of trilogy.I WILL BUY IT AS SOON AS IT IS AVAILABLE.THE HISTORICAL INFO WAS A1
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The movie didn't really hold our attention. The effects and CGI were good but the plot was a little thin. We also thought, that while there was a great cast, they were not really right for the parts they were given in this movie.<br /><br />We would not reccomend it.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|I am connecting with the director on this one. I understand that I'm in the minority here, but I feel this movie is a masterpiece. Try and think of it as just a piece of art, not necessarily a movie to be entertained by. I loved it.
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Solid ground definitely the top song.  The remainder of the album is a bit slower with strong blues.  Not my favorite type of stuff, but solid ground is so kick a$$, I rated it high.  I also couple it with the fact that yesterday's rockers never did and still do not need auto-tune...
0385535139|4.0|Great book by John Grisham. This was a gift for my husband, and he has thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great price, great book.
B008C20TDG|5.0|The most Amazing, fantastic book on paleo eating I have so far read. This book explains all you will ever need to know about healthy eating, and ridding yourself of many disease that are caused from unnatural and processed foods.<br />Do not miss this read.
B0013ND30M|1.0|This disc was damaged. By the time I realized it, return time passed.  Was unopened product so did not think to inspect it when we got it.  So very sad little girl.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I use this music when I am studying or writing.  It is very structured, but at the same time, very playful and passionate.  I often close my eyes and pretend I knew how to play the violin this way -- what a gift!
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Excellent acting and very funny.<br /><br />As usual his acting is excellent and the movie content was also great.<br /><br />He always makes great movies.
B006517W3G|5.0|I bought this gift as a father's day present for a dad who just rebuilt an old record player.  He and I both love jazz and bluesy tunes, and Amy Winehouse in particular.  He was thrilled with the album and said he listened to both records on his turntable.  Thanks for stocking this in vinyl!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|some of the levels took real thought! I loved it!!! cant wait for more! wish it had more than 8 levels but a good start for a fun game!
B001GU04N6|5.0|This was a gift for Father's Day, as I was trying to find a unique gift for a dad with many hobbies.  My dad, who rebuilt a record play last year, was thrilled with this gift and said he immediately listened to it upon receiving it.  Thanks for stocking this unique and vintage item.
0062238868|5.0|I brought this book after it was recommended to me by my brother.  All in all a real paper turner I finished it in one day.  I like how he went indepth with everything from his firearms to his EDC.  The Fact he included his wife's input really let's people know how it is for deployed servicemen.  I am a Army Veteran myself but I was single so I fortunately didn't have to deal with leaving a spouse behind when I deployed.  A must read for anyone curious about the Military or the Iraq War
0425263924|3.0|This is a note to all authors of this genre. Please, for the love of God, stop reminding us every other page that the guy is the best, most, utterly, completely, gorgeous man on the face of the earth with anatomy more befitting a horse than a human. Okay, we are happy to read about Eva smiling as she's eying up her man as he takes off his shirt. And fine, he's well endowed and knows how to use it. Happy to hear it. Its a fantasy and he's the physical embodiment of perfection, we get it, honestly. But there is a limit. You don't need to go on and on and on about it. It's tedious.<br /><br />And speaking of limits...<br /><br />I understand that victims of sexual abuse can become hyper-sexualized, but there are physiological limits involved in that, especially for men. And after going at it for hours on end shouldn't she be a little sore? He's supposedly HUGE... yes HUGE... and she is supposedly shallow, yet he slams the heck out of her for hours on end with no problems. Less than no problems, they jump right at it as soon as they come... no pun intended... to.<br /><br />Perhaps these stories are for virgins who have no clue how male or female anatomy really works. I hope not. They are going to be very disappointed.<br /><br />On a positive side, its nice to have a female character that isn't down on her looks and though not as wealthy as Mr. Mogul, has money of her own. I like that she has a job that, at least in this book, she refuses to give up. Though I don't see how she can realistically, I will be bummed if she leaves the job she clearly loves.<br /><br />It's not the worst thing I ever read. It's not the best either. Like everyone else, I was expecting at least a conclusion to some of the drama going on not a piling on of new. Also, would it kill the author to write this couple a slow and gentle intimate encounter. They do love each other, right???<br /><br />I power read all three books in 3 days. Sucker that I am, I know I'll get the next book, but I will feel used and dirty about it. Sound familiar?
0321344758|3.0|Mr. Krug needs to update this book. He's right on with the principle that the visitors to a website want navigation and organization to be intuitive. However, websites today are made from Drupal, Weebly, and other site designs that people are very familiar with. The design advice in this book doesn't take those layouts and design into account.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|In the decade it's taken to bring everything together, we've continually been promised that the Avengers would be the superhero movie to change all superhero movies and it's a damn good thing, because I really hate superhero movies. Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office. From the performances to the special effects this was once exciting, terrific movie, and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very challenging game that keeps you on your toes.  Never boring.  If you like puzzles, you will love this game.

B006C67NP6|5.0|As A professional pianist who plays a lot of songs without having to read the music, I frequently find myself playing with other musicians in a recording studio,  There, I must know the exact original chords that were written for a given song.  the Real Book with provide that for me.  There are many versions of chords that can be played on a given song, but the Real book gives me the chords that the composer originally wrote.  That way, every musician in the studio is :on the same page.&#34;  June Dunapant
B008MR1PDE|5.0|A must buy for all android music lovers. Great player. User friendly. Equiliser is very useful. Value for money. Better than others.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I chose this rating because they could have given Simon some more to do since he was a vampire I would have really liked to have seen more action from simon
B0059XTUB8|5.0|She is my absolute favorite! I wanted to see this movie when it was at the movie theater, but never got around to it. So ordering this movie to have for myself is amazing! She is and always will be my #1 girl! The DVD arrived on time and in good condition. Wonderful story!
B00992CF6W|3.0|So I updated..... and I played......I like the new items given BUT if I try to type a message, it freezes for hours and I hate it!!! Also, what is with this &quot;realms&quot; thing? Why isn't there a local multiplayer option too? Do I have to sign in every time I want to play with my friend? I mean, it's also a long time to sign up. Paying  for realms is stupid. Finally, where can you turn your world peaceful? I want to find ores without worrying about mobs and stuff. Please fix peaceful options, messaging crashes , make realms free (I mean, we already paid for the game; 7 dollars are a lot of money), and finally, please please please have a local multiplayer option too. I'm begging you Mojang
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I can easily see how this flick did well at the box office. It's an upbeat flick where true love conquers the zombie apocalypse.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book s good never seen the movie.  Read it in one setting' great author of the best boom I've read lately.
B000ID37LS|5.0|just as i remembered it. plays well now that i have a new computer. but i always loved this movie since it came out. MJF plays a great role in this and it has just the right balance of scary and funny
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Great original song played by a master. His technique is still a benchmark today and is mastered by few. Listen to enjoy and learn, his song stories are truly amazing novelettes. An amazing musician and man, too bad his life was cut short, greatness sometimes has hidden costs.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is the awesome one in the app store<br />Additionally you can see the game is cool<br />Yay<br />Yay
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful read. I hated for it to end. Ken Follett has done it again....a perfect tapestry of truth and fiction set against an intense historical backdrop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever I'm am the gamer also none as dork girl 999 follow me on all the games
B007FQDPL8|5.0|Thought I may have made a mistake when the story line started, but after completing the first season, can't wait to continue on with this spin on vampires.
B000QE9ERK|5.0|Everything about The Ninth Gate is top-notch: plot, acting, script, scenery, direction, and even the soundtrack is fascinatingly haunting.<br /><br />I am not a raving fan per se of Polanski, while Depp is one of the most engaging actors of our generation. Both deliver their best here, as do a pair of lovely ladies (Seigner and Olin).<br /><br />I have not read the book (\\"El Dumas Club\\") behind this motion picture, but I have seen The Ninth Gate six times (it's been showing on cable plus I have the DVD) now and it's as enjoyable as ever.<br /><br />Polanski has done a remarkable job at balancing things here by showing you plenty to spark your imagination, and then letting your imagination fill in certain gaps (including the ending). Nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />A bold claim yes, but this is truly the best supernatural film that I have ever seen. An extremely underrated effort, this ranks as one of my favorite films of all time.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|After watching the 1st season I could not wait to see the second. The complexity of the story line makes it not just entertaining but exciting too.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|It wasn't horrible - it wasn't great. Some of it was funny (though I'm not sure it was meant to be or not).  The weapons are not appropriate for the time period they are in, but then again the costumes aren't exactly wholly authentic either - if you're going to watch this you have to be willing to allow them these artistic licenses...<br /><br />There IS a lot of action - no shortage of witches to be killed.  And unlike the wizards in Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings (who don't seem to actually do much magic), these witches can do all kinds of cool stuff, so in that aspect it's kind of fun to watch.<br /><br />If your expectations aren't too high, and you don't overthink it, this can be a fun movie.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am almost finished with book two and have enjoyed every minute of reading.  This series draws you in and won't let put it down...beware you will read way past your bedtime if you start!!!!
0312330537|5.0|This is a truly absorbing read about a real life Aussie! It takes the reader through a life of a young man, divorced and alone, who descends into to the world of crime both within Australia, and then into India. It is a story of great courage, resourcefulness, crime in it's myriad forms, and ultimately, a story of compassion and new beginnings. It's one man's life journey and how he dealt with the hand fate dealt him - it's true, and it's inspiring.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Tommy Lee Jones is a fine actor, but in this film he's doing his best Jack Webb impression.  John Goodman enlivens the proceedings when he's around, but essentially the material and direction are too weak to give the actors a chance.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Very comical, and perfect for a rainy day when you just wanna watch one TV show all day long. ;)
B003D513TQ|5.0|Love this movie. Emily Blunt is wonderful and the story is engaging. I've seen it 10+ times and plan to watch it more yet.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age is fun and it helps people have the expirinse and responsibilities of life cool cool fun fun fun fun cool
B0076DELIG|4.0|Once again, an intriguing protagonist takes us through a complex mystery...one that spans a couple of decades. Great read and highly recommended. I know how difficult it is to write at this level as a mystery writer myself. Readers might also enjoy Pisaq Pipeline [[ASIN:B007MEYERM PISAQ PIPELINE, A World-Heritage Mystery]] set in the high Andes and rain forests of Peru.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|During the Napoleonic wars and sometime during the year 1805, the English ship HMS Suprise with 197 souls, entered the S. Atlantic in search of the French war ship, Acheron.  The Archeron had been raiding English whalers and seizing their cargo.  Captain \\"lucky Jack\\" Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has been charged with the taking her a prize or sinking of the Archeron, which he knows will be a difficult job, as the Archeron is a bigger, faster and more heavily armed war ship.<br /><br />The Archeron finds the HMS Suprise first and fires upon her out of a fog bank, killing and injuring many of the crew.  The tale ensues like a cat and mouse game, with each captain trying to get the best of the other.<br /><br />The realism and authenticity in this film is breath taking.  The tight quarters and bad food, combined with the saltyness of the sailors makes one feel like he is actually on board the ship.<br /><br />There is a fond friendship between captain Aubrey and the ship's surgeon, Dr Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  A conflict arises when Dr Maturin wants to go ashore in the Galapagos Islands to study the fauna and capain Jack refuses, however, when Dr Maturin is accidently shot,  Aubrey abandons the chase to give medical attention to his friend on the island.<br /><br />Though they are sailors and soldiers, the men are superstitious and believe one of the ship's officers is a \\"Jonah\\" and has been bringing them bad luck.  Even the man himself believes it and commits suicide.  Physical punishment here is a reality.  When one of the sailors is given 10 lashes for failing to salute.<br /><br />Director, Peter Weir has done a masterful job making this film work and bringing the viewer back in time to experience life aboard an 1805 English ship of the line.  The realism is truely amazing.  Russell Crowe is an inspiring commander.  I would follow him into battle anywhere.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and would like to see others of its kind.  I'm sure you will too.
B008MYYODK|5.0|This is an excellent collection of historical recordings for Wagnerians.  Some of the complete sets have been available at various times, but having these together in a set makes them even more worthwhile.  The excerpts selected are also of interest and include some noteworthy artists who aren't easy to find nowadays.  Listening to these recordings is a good way to celebrate the Wagner bicentennial.
B005LAII12|5.0|ANYONE LIVING DURING THE 80' and razed some he'll would appreciate the humor.<br />l would think it's funny. Not to be watched with young children or hardcore do golfers.
B00BGIC3T6|5.0|Although &#34;This is 40&#34; is not for folks who would be offended by some rough language and sexual content (it IS rated R, after all), my family and friends and I, who have watched it, found it to be a laugh out loud movie that we could all relate to.  I mean laugh out loud to the point that my cheeks ached and I had tears running down my face on several occassions throughout the movie.  This was true for my 74 year old mother as well.  I saw this movie first in the theater and enjoyed it so much that I have since watched it two additional times and I am a NOT the type of person to even watch a movie twice. Enjoy!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This movie was so silly that I got a good laugh several times. From the pictures of the missing kids on the milk bottles to the somewhat fanatical young man who is starstruck with the two heroes, one has to pay attention or something will slip by while you are blinking.<br /><br />The only part I DIDN'T like was the killing of the pretty red-headed witch near the end. I thought that was a waste of a great character for a future movie. Plus, she was damned pretty.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is a very fun game that u should play. It just keeps getting better and better always fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great read. It's not all about the sex. To be loved like that would be a dream.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Replaced an AMD 64 x2 4600+ that was hot & loud.  This cpu is ultra quiet and runs flawlessly.  Windows Experience Index is 5.8 running Vista Ultimate 32-bit.
1416584072|4.0|It was really interesting to read about a different culture and experiences that are so unfamiliar to me. We see the main character, Nazneen, journey from a Bangladeshi village to London at the age of 18, and watch her adapt to a much different kind of life. There are a series of letters exchanged between Nazneen and her sister (demonstrating the very different lives they lead and the role that fate plays), Nazneen and her husband create a family of their own (whose children assimilate more than the parents would like), and Nazneen begins an affair with a much younger man (who is very different from her husband). The book inspired me to watch the movie, but as per usual, the book was much better. I really enjoyed reading this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down and am about to immediately purchase and devour the final book of the trilogy. Loved it!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Lots of action as is common in Grisham novels.  This kept my interest from cover to cover.  Not as heavy on the legal front, but plenty to keep you hooked.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Detail. Dialog. Story. These substances are very well developed for the motives pursued. I'm really enjoying the backdrop of Iceland as well as the other locations they are using. I wish season 3 was available on AIV.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Kitchen House definitely keeps you reading!!! It is not, however, a happy book. I got mad at the characters from time to time.
1401937519|5.0|Anita's message resonated with me.  I love her descriptions of her NDE.  I already gave this book to a friend and purchased another for my brother's birthday.  He is cancer free for 5 years; never had a treatment.  He changed his way of looking of life, similar to how Anita describes how life is supposed to be.  I used to think life was something to be endured; now I know it's to be enjoyed!
0374531269|4.0|\\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier\\" is an autobiography of Ishmael Beah's harrowing tale as a child soldier in Sierra Leone as a teenage boy. This book transports the reader to a part of Africa that is seemingly modern, yet tainted with war. This is just one account out of thousands of children that are kidnapped and forced to fight for a cause that isn't even logical. Ishmael Beah has a way with words, his journey is tragic, but he writes so that he doesn't sound bitter and angry. His words are almost tranquil. Beah sheds light on the controversy in Sierra Leone without sounding morbid. He lets his guard down enough so that the readers can transport themselves and understand the struggles he faced. His words are full of emotions and while reading this book, you cannot help being flooded with the sadness Beah has faced. There is also a sense of happiness and hope in this book.  It shows how truly resilient humans are.<br />The book starts off with a reflection and opening statement on the situation, then, it gets into the journey faced. Beah lived a normal life, where he lived was slightly modern and had a good education. The way he describes his life at the beginning of the books sounds so peaceful, it's almost as if it seems like nothing so terrible could ever go on.  In a blink of an eye on a peaceful day, terror engulfs the town Beah was staying in. The irony is, on this day, Beah described it as being \\"extra peaceful.\\" Beah then describes how he ran from the rebels and tried to stay with his friends. Ishmael and his friends have a brush with danger, rebels had captured their group. By some miracle, the group managed to escape. Although they managed to escape, the group was split apart. Beah now had to not only hide from the rebels, but he now had to try and survive on his own. At this point in the book, the words feel heavy and Beah tries to sound optimistic with his words. The next part of the book he describes trying to find safety with a new group ofyoung boys.<br />Beah then fast forwards through time as a boy soldier, only releasing certain bits and pieces of information because, this topic is very controversial and morbid. He still eloquently describes his predicament enough so that the readers can feel the sorrow boy soldiers felt. Even after he describes his time as a boy soldier and his recovery after being rescued, he still doesn't sound angry and bitter towards the situation. There is still hope in his writing. Eventually, he is saved and described his new life in America. Although this book seems like a simple read, it is full of emotion and is a great narrative on such a devastating situation. This is a book that everyone needs to read; it honestly puts life into perspective and makes the reader feel truly grateful for their life. So much is so eloquently described in just 218 pages.  Big things really do come into small packages.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am in to this show! It is just wonderful. Can't wait for season 4! Amazon Instant is much faster for downloads than Netflix - plus it allows captions.

B0042J6VUS|4.0|Nice no problems, seems of good quality, was a great buy. Only downside is that it came from Hong Kong so took forever to get here. But I was aware of that. .
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|this game seems stupid but it is kind of fun and addictive. i remember my first time i played. sooner or later it was an hour later.
B007REW8AC|5.0|I really love this girl's singing.  Her voice is very good but her style takes it up another notch.  She writes beautiful lyrics and as a song writer  myself, I was very inspired by her success story.  I've been cheering her on since I first heard her on So You Think You Can Dance.  Any time I hear her voice in the background, at a super market, on a commercial, or whereever, it brings a smile to my face.<br />Well done Christina.  Can't wait to hear more.<br />People, buy this album.  It's a treat from the first song on.
B00BLSJI80|4.0|not much to say but i like this album, ill listen to it, i shared it with others and i think you will too.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I have purchased every season of this most marvelous series. I have used it in my classroom since the series' beginning, and now I am truly saddened to see it end. I have introduced the series to my students and wish they could have gotten a few more seasons by including some of the Knights of the Round Table and their individual adventures. Merlin, I will miss you.

B009VYF5E2|5.0|This has been one of the most exciting series to come from the BBC, next to Dr. Who! I have purchased all five of the seasons, and am truly saddened to see it come to an end, especially since my students have truly grown to love the series as much as I.
B0096MM9GG|5.0|the only reason i wanted this game was because i remember having it on my first computer back in the days when window op didnt exist yet. remember those day when you have to type (win or games) to get window or the play game on the computer. anyway its the same version but with better graphic. hey its fun once in a while.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed how all the individual stories all connected the family members together. Each member had their own perspective of events and how they fit in the family. As always good story telling and exploring of the culture. Words that break your heart, strong charter building, and how lives change due to others actions.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|The albums great! Nothing bad about it. It's everything you expect from it:) I love little mix. There music is so uplifting and inspiring!
0061122416|5.0|Heard great things about this book. Finally picked it up and glad I did. Recommending to all friends and family; everyone agrees. The Alchemist will not disappoint!
B007JZGIMS|1.0|It's sketchy &amp; it wouldn't let me play music after I got THIS App. It's almost the same as the free version.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|On my Kindle Fire, this is one of my favorite games to play. Highly addictive. The objective is essentially to slash as much fruit as you can during a limited period of time (or in the unlimited play, to just keep slashing) with special fruits that do special things that you slash for extra points or bonuses. There's a big fruit, pomegranate, I think, that you can slash multiple times for extra points, and then the bombs that you stay away from. Sometimes when I start playing, I can't stop--so I try not to let myself even start! But it's hard! It's just a simple, but fun game.<br /><br />I've read the other reviews for those who play on their phones and I can say that on the Kindle Fire, these issues aren't there. I have and can play the game without any internet access at all since my Kindle only has internet when I'm at as hot spot or at my home router--so I play it all the time at Dr. offices and such without any internet access at al--so on the Kindle Fire, access to the internet isn't required for game play.<br /><br />Also, on the paid version, I've not had a single pop up message or ad like some of the phone users are saying they have had. I've play a LOT too, and so my scores are up there, and the only 'rewards' I get are new blades or backgrounds and those only come after the game ends.<br /><br />I don't, however, play on the OpenFeint network--so I wonder if people who are getting popups and such are getting them from OpenFeint and not the game? Yes, OpenFeint members ARE required to be connected to the internet when playing, but if you don't play on OpenFeint, you aren't required to be.<br /><br />On the Kindle Fire, the screen is good sized, the visual graphics are gorgeous and the game play is fast and fun. Like I said, highly addictive, and I haven't had any of the problems of some of the other phone-based players.
0920668372|5.0|Book was in perfect shape & arrived earlier than expected. Every child should grow up with this book! I cannot read it without crying !
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Ok, so you have to suspend a bit of disbelief to really love this movie. But the action is wild and fun, the MI team's banter is humorous, and the storyline is entertaining. Language and adult content is kept to a minimum which is nice for family's who enjoy watching this type of movie together. Just a fun movie.
B009O2XY12|3.0|this is a cute game but it is not for adults I think kids 12 years and younger would really enjoy this game.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This is a very good film. Both Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are believable as husband and wife, parents, and victims of a horrific natural disaster. The young actors who play their sons are terrific as well. The special effects of the tsunami are breath-taking. I found myself alternately holding my breath and weeping as I watched this family (and others in the film) be swept away by the water and deal with the tragic aftermath.
B008XKT9FG|3.0|Story line was just OK==It was entertaining to a point but would not buy it. Helen Hunt always does a good job in any movie.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|It was a pretty good flick. The acting was okay. Nothing great. The story was okay. It may have been better if this came out when it wasn't heavily shadowed by Twilight and other super-natural themed movies. I've heard the book was good.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't watch it again if it was free on TV.
193700788X|1.0|This is a really bad book. Characterized by poor, sloppy writing,it seemed as if Ms. Harris just wanted to finish the darn series and get it over with. Most of the still-extant characters were tossed in to finish off their storylines regardless of how well written those storylines were. And they are poorly written.<br /><br />Historically she has never written well in the third person and her forays in this book prove she shouldn't try it anymore. Her real strengths have always been humor and characterization -- and neither of those two qualities were apparent in this book.<br /><br />I understand she is starting another series (written in third person).  I for one won't be reading that.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book is smart and funny. It kept me smiling and had no boring flat spots. His straight down the line factual assessments combined with her quirks combine make their quest into a comedy.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|the movie starts out kind of slow. The Main character's narratives are funny and Surprise! John Malcovich!<br /><br />Progresses in the expected story arc, no real surprises.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I have always enjoyed Dr Who.  This season is fun but not for kids.  I had to watch after my 10 year old went to bed (she got too scared with the second one.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like how you can mix all different sounds and custom it to how you are feeling or help you when you are feeling creative
B001EN71CW|4.0|I liked it, it is a pity they did only one season and a movie. Anyway it is worthy to invest your time watching it
B005UG542S|5.0|Awesome ending that perfectly aligns the book. A lot of actions and kept me on my toes. The ending of the series was truly the end of an era and I couldnt ask for it to be any better. Bravo.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The previous were better, I couldn´t stop reading. This book is okay, entertained..... but not the jewel of the crown
B008OOYALE|4.0|I wish there were more choices in what to grow! Somewhere between 1 or 5hrs would be nice :) Also, maybe a confirmation for spending jewels. I accidentally made a HUGE purchase :( An easier way to add neighbors or visit them (the pages take forever to load) Other than that, fun to play &amp; the sounds and music are fun to hear too! Thanks!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This is another classic case of the book being better than the movie. If you have read the book you will likely find the movie to be disappointing. A great deal of the plot of the book is missing from the movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Very quick charging. It is a much better product than what is supplied with the unit when purchased. Why is it not placed in new units?
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book and everything gets tied up no lose ends. It did not turn out quite how I wanted but still an awesome book I am sad that this is the end for Sookie. If u love Sookie then u will love this last book in the series.
B00464AVXW|5.0|It was AWESOME.<br /><br />I also appreciate the option to receive it the following day!!!!!<br />It was needed obviously for last min party.<br /><br />THANKS
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I bought this movie for my child because he loves animals and it keeps him entertained for hours and its about adventure, and friendship I would recommend this movie to anybody
B0089LOG02|4.0|Great story.  Written well.  History I did not know about.  Characters well defined.  Would read book from this author again

B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Felt like the production was as slow as the person that was portraying a depressed person.  Strange twist produced a little intrigue.  Glad we did not pay full price to see it in the theater.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game easy to learn and very addictive fun for everyone game has great graphics and is very User friendly AWESOME
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 1 was OK. But ever since Temple Run 2 came out, I have been addicted!! Fave game ever in 2013!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Like the mental kind.  This game calls to me when I'm not playing it.  I will sit and stare at it if I can't play because I have run out of energy.  There is a help page on the Internet that gives you great tips and advice, but it really needs to be a support group for those of us who can't walk away from the game.<br />I told my son the other day to hide my ipad so I could accomplish something instead of sitting down playing this game for six hours.  Yes, I'm that bad.<br />If you are a normal person who can control yourself, you should have fun exploring this manor and the rooms within.  What I especially like about this game, what makes it so different from all the other &#34;hidden object&#34; games, is that most of the objects are out in the open.  And for the most part, they are the same objects every time you go into that particular room.  What changes are the conditions under which you are looking for them, and their placement.  For example, you might be looking for the objects in &#34;night&#34; mode, where the room is totally dark and you just have a very small circle of light that you move about the room in which to find the objects.<br />Also, you are given quests to fulfill throughout the game.  You may have to search a room in a certain mode so many times to unlock another room.<br />You make &#34;friends&#34; by helping other players, and I have &#34;met&#34; people from all over the world.  I think that is one of the reasons why I love the game so much is because there are so many dynamics to it; it's not like other hidden object games where you just go into a room and scour it to find items that are blended into the scene like in a Highlights magazine.<br />There are a couple of things that I'm not so crazy about, but I think they are this way for a reason.  You spend energy when you go into rooms.  It takes a while for your energy to restore and the higher up you get in the game, the longer it takes.  Example: a room might take 40 units of energy.Your energy restores at 1 unit every 3 minutes.  As you get higher in the game, some rooms require 90 units, but you still only restore at 1 every 3 minutes.  So it's very easy to blow through your energy in a matter of ten minutes, then have to wait HOURS for it to restore.<br />Another downside, is almost everything costs &#34;diamonds&#34; if you want to purchase it using game currency.  Earning diamonds is a VERY slow process, and everything costs a crap ton of diamonds.  Probably the #1 complaint is about how slow/hard it is to get diamonds.<br />Can you use real cash to buy diamonds? Sure. Have I? Nope.  I've been playing this game about 4 month, and haven't spent a cent on it, it was even free to download, and I've done fine.  There have been times when I have been super frustrated because I've wished that I've had this or that, but I think if I had unlimited energy, or unlimited diamonds and could just keep going forever, first, I'd NEVER get anything done, and second, there would be no challenge in it for me.  So I grumble, stare at the screen and hope I receive some super powers that will grant me unlimited diamonds, and when that doesn't happen, I figure its a sign to get up off my aching butt and actually have a life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|FUN cool trickey at times good game smart I can escape fantastic great love it buy it and have fun
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Great app to flush unnecessary apps temp files. Very easy to use if you need to clear the cache, to clear other files, it was a little confusing to understand if it will clean the temp file or delete the file. Found out it deletes the file, so be careful.
B001LOU8ME|5.0|This is a great show from the classic line-up of MSG. This cd  features an expanded concert featuring a drum solo by the late Cozy Powell. The sound of this cd is a bit warmer sounding than the original single cd release. I would highly recommend this cd plus the first two studio albums by MSG but this one would be the one to start with IMO.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My kid still plays with this app from time to time. She loves the noises reactions, and the way Tom Cat repeats everything she says. Great app for kids.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|A real listening pleasure. As always with Clutch, great Musical work from the band and Neil’s lyrics “once again” are moving. “The Faces” is a song that will really make you think.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This is beautiful music with stellar musicianship. I have so much respect for Sting. What an artist! And we are lucky to have him.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book for my niece, she just turned 2 years old. She loves the book, and I think she would appreciate it even more as she grow up.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So much fun to play, I have a hard time putting the game down!  My children and I spend a lot of timelooking at the fish and planning where all the plants go.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this book at the suggestion of my sister but did not find it as enthralling...  Found myself flipping between bored and surprised but unfortunately more of the former than the latter...
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This movie is very good, but it could have been brilliant. The problem for me is that it's a bit of a jumble. Part cheesy spaghetti-western tribute (not particularly well done, IMO) with some outright comedy (hilarious at times), modern music thrown in (seemed like an afterthought), with comic-book-violence (just because it's expected in a QT movie) and the result is.......a movie that doesn't seem to quite know where it's at. QT should have either made a \\"proper\\" spaghetti-western, or a modern western, or an typical QT stylized western. Instead he tried to juggle all of those, and the result doesn't quite work out. Brilliant at times....clumsy and self-gratifying at others. I would give the movie itself 3 stars.<br /><br />What this film DOES have though is some truly exceptional performances. Christopher Waltz is astounding (again) and creates one of the most memorable characters I've seen in quite a while. DiCaprio takes on a role that doesn't seem quite right for him, but really pulls it off with gusto! Samuel L Jackson's hilariously cranky old Stephen is the best performance I've seen from him since Pulp Fiction. Even Don Johnson puts in the performance of a lifetime. For his part, Jamie Foxx makes for an excellent Django - brooding yet confident. With these characters all working together (the negotiations over dinner, for example) the result is incredibly tense and compelling - classic QT stuff. For the performances I'd give this movie 5 stars.<br /><br />Although not his best movie, thank god for Quentin Tarantino!
1475972350|2.0|One of the longstanding tropes about the psyche of a murderer is that taking lives gets easier the more you do it. The same, I think, can be said about writing novels. Once you get that first one out of your system and prove that you can actually do it, the more skillful you become.<br /><br />To the author's credit, he has taken that initial bold move and gotten his work published. Although I'm the first to admit that I'm not a fan of the horror genre, I read enough of this material in my capacity as a script consultant for the film industry to be able to assess whether a story's dynamics are plausible and sustainable, its characters are well drawn, and its dialogue sounds natural. The author clearly is a master at painting gory, graphic, and disgusting visuals, and the premise of a serial killer who hates time-wasters is a compelling hook. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on multiple levels, many of which - including a poor job of editing - can hopefully be remedied in future storylines.<br /><br />The first of these is the stilted dialogue. Regardless of the age, gender or occupation of the characters, they all speak in exactly the same \\"voice,\\" never use contractions, and utilize conversations as a device to explain things to the readers rather than genuinely interact with one another. (An easy way for writers to identify this problem is to have friends read their dialogue out loud as if it were a script.) The villain in this tableau is especially repetitious and engages in a long-winded explanation of his motivations that occurs at the halfway point of the novel. Were this a movie, this cliché speech would come toward the end of the film and easily allow the heroes enough time to leisurely orchestrate a rescue. Once everything is revealed at the midpoint about the killer's motivations and future plans, it's much too tempting to simply stop reading. Keeping us guessing - and keeping the killer more visible - would have been a better strategy.<br /><br />A lot more research is needed to capture the realities of police investigations and interrogations; as written, none of what is portrayed would pass muster. The pair of lead detectives as well as their counterparts are straight from Central Casting as cop stereotypes and are further encumbered by their inability to figure out any of the clues that are liberally strewn or splashed in their paths. Contrivance abounds at every turn and Max' dark secret about his own past is, alas, not the major reveal the author may have intended. Also problematic are the loopholes insofar as the killer's unexplained ability to effortlessly break into homes, his access to drugs (and copious amounts of duct tape), his flexibility to stalk his future victims, and why his dry cleaner never seems to question all that blood on his clothes. Even throwing in a hot lesbian is not enough to save a storyline that derails fairly early but just doesn't know how to come to a satisfying closure.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is another great example of BBC television. Wish we could get more than just BBCA to view great shows like these. Grant it, the US puts out some great shows but, I am so tired of all the reality shows we keep throwing out there.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This set contains one of the best movies ever made and comes with every extra you could ask for. I especially love the cd for my car and the sing a long with the movie and the fun facts you can have pop up while you watch the movie. If you love Sound of Music, you will love this set.
0823023494|5.0|I used this book for my cartooning class and it was very helpful! I learned so much! Tom Bancroft is awesome!
B001ECDVKE|3.0|this is like one of those silly-ass flicks u watch late at night when there's nothing else on. you actually get to watch Tom Jones acting and running away from martians.
B000XWJMGS|3.0|This is an attractive plug. My complaint is that the solder points are in the elbow of the plug and not in the straight barrel. This makes for tricky soldering with my minimal soldering skill.<br /><br />I also disliked how the ring and tip solder points had holes in them to wind the wire through before soldering, but the ground point did not have such a hole. To solder the ground wire you just have to hold it in place against the curved metal. I found this less than ideal.<br /><br />Ultimately I purchased a Switchcraft 35HDRABAU which kept its solder points in the barrel and I found much easier to work with.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Right away, when I first recieved my cd I was stunned. The packaging fantastic! The inside was well thought out, and the music has outstanding quallity! If you are a Hans Zimmer fan it's a must have. The future of Superman lives on.
B000002O4X|5.0|I listen to this disk a lot.<br />It contains the piece &#34;Let the Rest of the World Go By&#34; which was used in the &#34;last dance&#34; scene.<br />The insert relays some of John Barry's thoughts on his composing for the film.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Its a really fun game. I wanted to try and it wa  on sale so i got it. I was not disappointed with it. Multiplayer and Campaign is cool
B00003CY0V|4.0|would recommend it, quick service and of course great action, with twists and a touch of real few movies have and<br />the alternate ending also made it great.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|we liked the free version, and upgraded to the full veriosn. The keys are small and so are a bit difficult for even the smallest fingers. However, we do like it and love listening to the pieces before we try to play them.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I was expecting this to be a funny movie. There were a handful of funny scenes but it was more depressing than anything. Unfortunately the style is not dramatic enough to make the 'real-life' issues interesting. It was just long.
0425263924|2.0|Disappointed with this book, would like a more complex Gideon than one who is always running off to save Eva, really we get he is in love with her, how many times do they have to go over it?  Found myself yawning through this one.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Another good Harry Hole novel. Can't wait for this one to be made into a movie. Have moved on to the next book in he series. A decent enjoyable read.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|You might only enjoy this if you remember the original. Overall pretty good movie.They could have put in Dorothy arriving later as an ending.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook app works well on the Kindle as it does on any other device. Nothing much to say but that I guess we are all addicted to FB.
B000YMJA7I|4.0|Theres nothing like some old school GNR especially when on sale.I would highly suggest this album over the others. Ok
B0007CYW5A|5.0|excellent product was what I was expecting, very good quality recommend has a very good, and its functions meet my expectations
B000005HFH|5.0|Wonderful cd. Thank you for the quick service and great price. Chet Baker is an awesome Jazz artist who will not be forgotten.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. A lot of my friends did not like the ending but I thought it so incredible that the author could even begin to create such a twisted story. It sure held my attention.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book drew me in like no other. The format added such an intimate feeling that I felt his letters were meant for me.  I loved the characters and I was sad to have the story end. I would like to see what the characters have become in the future. I loved this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I build my world then I was build my house then a creeper came I hear him so It did blow up apart of my house
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love this game!  So many levels with different challenges.  After I beat the game I went back through the levels to improve my times.  The storyline is nice, but I don't really care about that in puzzle games.  Graphics are pleasant to look at and I enjoy the calming music. I can play for an hour or more!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I love it but then I love Rod Stewart.  If you are a fan I am sure you will love it too.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|I wish somebody had put this book in my hand when I graduated, I would have been less afraid to ask for what I wanted and I would have been bold and taken a more proactive approach on my career.
B002T45VX6|3.0|I was not crazy about the album but I don't usually buy this type of music.  I just have seen her on the Voice and decided to try one of her albums.  She is great just not my thing.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Loses its tight story-telling by the end of the second, leaves several plot points unresolved (or resolved poorly) and misses a couple of opportunities.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I had not seen this when it hit the theaters, but wanted to watch something and Mr. M. always catches my eye.  Well done, lots of good people in it.
1591845556|5.0|The timing of this book suited me well. I had just finished reading [[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]] by Timothy Ferriss, another book on rapid skill acquisition, and was in the midst of finishing Josh Kaufman's first book, [[ASIN:1591845572 The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business]]. This book, The First 20 Hours, was appropriate just-in-time information for me, as opposed to just-in-case information. Another opportunity to look at rapid skill acquisition.<br /><br />Overall, there are two features of this book that caused me to give it a 5* over 4* review:<br /><br />1. Book Layout<br /><br />The first three chapters supply the core of the book's teachings. I read the first three chapters, knew everything I needed to know, and got started brainstorming the prime skill I wanted to focus on. This was instant learning. It took me an afternoon to get started. Many books gloss over important concepts, and make it hard to remember all the useful gold I'm supposed to implement and take to heart. This book went straight to the point.<br /><br />The case studies are six skills learned by the author, following his own advice. How often do you see this? Not very often. He followed his own advice to not only prove it works, but inspire those of us out there who wish to do the same. By having an example to follow, it becomes much easier to visualize ourselves doing this.<br /><br />Kaufman built credibility into his book, and reality. Two important concepts many author's don't present to readers.<br /><br />2. Author's Message<br /><br />Kaufman is not some Nobel Prize winning laureate, or Ph.D. genius. He is an enjoyable author to read, yes, but he is also a regular guy, and a new father. He is tight on time, and he wants to learn new things. His story and teachings resonate with us, because we are him. We want to learn new things too, and we worry about finding the time to do them; especially in Western culture.<br /><br />The purpose of a book is to teach us something we can use, or to help us take a new action. This book has already helped me take new actions, and that is invaluable for a small investment of $12 and three hours of reading.<br /><br />I believe in the author's message, I resonate with him, I root for him, and in turn, I started to root for myself. I can do this too. This book is reality. I've learned that I can truly learn new skills, and it doesn't have to feel like a second job to get good at. That is value.<br /><br />Note: The case-studies aren't essential reading in my opinion, but I found two useful tidbits that may be overlooked by readers:<br /><br />\\"Recent research suggests that, for greatest effect, it's best to sleep within four hours of motor skill practice: even a short nap is better than nothing at all. Any longer, and your brain's ability to consolidate the information it gathered during practice is impaired.\\"<br /><br />\\"Interference is the opposite of consolidation: it's a disruption of the consolidation process. If you practice or use a second, similar skill shortly after practicing a new skill, that practice can interfere with your brain's ability to consolidate the new information.\\"
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I enjoyed the digital order immensely. I hope to be able to keep gaining access to more great features such as this. Keep them coming.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book was very good. I read the book first and was so disappointed with the Movie. I know Hollywood can't go into the details like the book but they leave out to many of the good parts and change others. I would recommend everyone to read the book it is very good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with such sweet morals and so entertaining.  My children enjoy it very much and we the parents do too. We are wating anxiously for the sequel.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept me captive from day one-the story of Lavinia and her adopted family was so overwhelming it was very hard to put down.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|a classic.  alex guiness was fantastic in his role as the commanding officer of the British pows.  The contrast between Holden's character and Guiness' is a lesson in character
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|We love The Piano Guys!  It's fun to hear some original works as well as their signature re-mixes.  Highly recommend!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The book of course was much better than the movie. Great movie, but they left out so many details. If you haven't read the book, you should.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Plot was terrible, acting likewise.  Just created to make some money for Bruce Willis.  Too bad, because the other Die Hard movies were pretty good.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A fast paced, action packed read. Kept me on my toes and guessing a lot of the time. This book is perfect for the person who likes action/mystery with just a touch of romance. I give 5 stars because I was enraptured by this book and I couldn't put it down. Finished it within 24 hours. Can't wait to read Die Trying!!!
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|Absolutely love this album. It has such a dark overtone, but that is merely the beginning. I should have pre-ordered...
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash is surprisingly bright and lights up a substantial amount of space. I have used it to photograph speakers who were standing over 20 feet away and had nice results. I am glad I purchased this Speedlight and will keep it with me whenever I am out and about.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The game was amazing the best app I've ever downloaded but I played for a while and got pretty far in the game beat campaign got good at multiplayer but then I tried to get on and it said MC4 has stopped and I thought hey it's just a little bug then I tried it over and over and it still hasn't worked I don't want to delete because all my data will be erased if anyone knows what I can do please tell me it would help a lot. And if you could fix it thank you. :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this series and season 2 does not disappoint! We find it is fun to watch one show after the other and it is hard to turn it off.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|Good fun.  They don't make them like this anymore and that's a good thing- keeps movies like this special. I still think its amazing though that Bogie was voted the best actor of all time.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The acting and action in this movie are very well done.  Jessica Chastain was amazing.  I highly recommend Zero Dark Thirty.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This is a runner's review for the KOKKIA i10s paired with JayBird BlueBuds X Sport headphones for the 6th gen ipod nano.  I have been using these for a little over two months now and loving it.  Ever since I purchased my nano two years ago, I longed to wear it as a watch untethered--specifically for jogging.  Together with my bluetooth headphones and my integrated watch band, the KOKKIA helps make that a reality! It is small enough to be virtually unobtrusive, meshing seamlessly with the watch/nano interface.  I also splurged and bought the BlueBud Xs to pair with it, which are pricey, but worth it for the sound quality and fit (see my review of those for more details).<br /><br />JayBird makes a similar bluetooth transmitter to the KOKKIA, but reading the sketchy reviews related to reception, I went with KOKKIA instead.  I am very glad I did.  There is no trick to pairing this with the BlueBuds--you plug it into the interface socket on the nano turn on the headphones, wait for the headphones to tell you they are connected, and off you go.<br /><br />If there is one very minor complaint, it's that on rare occasions, the pairing on startup can take up to a minute for some unknown reason--I have no idea if the delay is due to the transmitter, the headphones, or both.  Most of the time, they connect within 10-15 seconds or faster.  And regardless, once they are connected, they STAY CONNECTED.  I have never had a single instance of a drop, or an issue with interference/bad connection--the transmitter range is beyond 20 feet, and since I wear it on my wrist, this distance is no problem.  The sound is clear and remains so until I turn off the headphones--no matter how much I jump around or flap my arms or whatever.<br /><br />Battery life:  it is certainly true that the transmitter drains the nano battery, and that is to be expected. I usually run for 30-45 minutes at a time, and I can get at least two runs in before I have to recharge the nano, and most of the time I can get three runs in.  Of course, it all depends on how much you use the nano screen as you switch between songs, etc.  I try to keep that to a minimum.  This is perfectly fine for me--those who run longer will need to consider this, but the system should be good for an hour and a half at least.<br /><br />Bottom line: I am finally able to jog with good music and no cords while interfacing with my music device from my wrist--in my opinion, it is the perfect blend for a recreational runner until a HUD becomes feasible (if ever). I am disappointed that Apple has gone away from this design with the next generation--here's hoping my 6th gen lasts for now!get three runs in.

B005LAIHPY|1.0|this is suppose to be from the board game please tell me where the aliens come in with it.  through the whole movie the navy is fighting against aliens that should be in the transformer movies more then this.  the aliens are just about blast proof.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I have been reading these books since they came out love them. The only thing I wished was that it answered the biggest question the one I believe the the reader wanted. But the adrenaline the story gives you keeps you reading without stopping. Enjoy the good read
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|The last Bruce Willis Movie for me, it sucked, Bruce sucked but the kid who played his son did a good job.<br />I hope the kid gets to have a career.<br />Bruce, it is time to hang up the spurs. Now I won't watch anything with Willis, I never thought I would say this but Ben Affleck is doing great movies and Willis is down the drain and backstroking in the septic tank..<br />Over and out.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Not many guns available at first release. Still seems a quality product.  I liked the ealier offering too. I support it in hopes that additional weapons will be modeled, WW2 had a vast number to choose from after all.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This was an excellent DVD in the Jesse Stone series. I would strongly recommend this DVD even if the remaining Jesse Stone DVDs are not  available.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids play it all the time. Seems cute and challenging for them.  A Perry centric version of Where is my Water...
B00008XEOI|5.0|Love the additional bonus disks and art. Awesome for the animation enthusiast of Disney and general animation. Lovely display for artists. Would recommend 200%!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Customer service came through for me. This is the same cord that came with the Kindle Fire HD. For some reason my original cord and or PowerFast charger started to act up.  Amazon replaced both for me at no charge under warranty. Works great now
B007HIEBV2|5.0|I've loved Caravan Palace since they first started and they continue to better themselves! I can't wait to see what they make in the future. I can only hope they continue and look forward to the future! Beautiful music~!!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If I don't get the level in the minimum number of moves, I keep at it until I get a perfect score.  Great puzzle.  Please keep coming up with additional puzzles, I'm almost through this set.
193700788X|1.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />This book feels like it was thrown together haphazardly in an attempt to finish out the contract.  The main characters seemed like ghostly shells of their former selves and the storyline was non-existant.  It's almost as if a completely different person wrote the last book.  After reading the other books quickly and barely being able to put them down, this one was an absolute struggle to finish.  I found myself so irriated at one point that I put it down and didn't pick it back up for at least a week.<br /><br />The ending was terrible with almost every character making a short appearance and then ending made absolutely no sense what so ever.  I am not sure I still understand why Claude and the two other men were out to get Sookie.  Eric's character turns into a complete wimp overnight compared to the cool calculating vampire that has survived thousands of years in a few pages.  Probably like every other fan, I found Sookie ending up with Sam to be a sham.  She could have ended up with anyone else and I may have been a bit happier.<br /><br />If you were a fan of all of the other books, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this one.  I find True Blood's new bizarro Lilith world to be more entertaining and that is saying someting.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The story dragged on & too many one liners that got boring. Learning about yeman & al Qaida  was interesting.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is the third Kate Morton novel I've read, and I just love her as an author. It started a little slow, but builds energy quickly and held my attention to the last word. Awesome book, you wont be disappointed!
B000V4UFZK|4.0|I like it and the special effects are good for when it was made. Interesting premise. One of the first horror films based on a Poltergeist. Actually, I do not recall ever seeing a movie about specifically a Poltergeist although, of course, I have seen many that depict hauntings .
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Just as all the other reviews have said; this book and all the others are full of repetition, sex, more sex, and a tad bit of story line.<br /><br />It's not a horrible book but it could have been better. I'll continue reading series as I don't deny being hooked but I wish I want reading the same words over and over again. So far the second is better than the first, we'll see how I feel about the third soon.<br /><br />I don't get why Anastasia is always mad about such childish stuff. How is it fair at all to get mad about something that happened before they even met. Seriously, real relationships don't work that way.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This an interesting drama based on a Indian young man winning the Indian &#34;Who wants to be a millionaire&#34; show. They do not believe he should know the things he knows so he has to recount stories from his childhood in an Indian slum to convince them. Won the Oscar for best picture and star Rev Patel.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Not your classic tale of Hansel &Gretel. Very action paced and with a twist. Like some of the weaponry quite a bit.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|As Denzel Washington matures in age, so do the roles that he plays.  In this film he plays an aging airline pilot who becomes a hero after a turbulent flight turns catastrophic.  Or is he a hero?  There's more to this story than meets the eye. Whip Whittaker(Washington) has a lot going on in his life--he's a divorced dad who is estranged from his family and to make matters worse, he has serious addiction problems.  During his hospitalization after the crash, he meets an addict, played by a very talented Kelly Reilly.  If Whip's life is already a mess, this woman  is a walking disaster. She lives in a weed infested neighborhood in a rundown apartment run by a sleazy landlord.  Her jobs to support her habit consist mostly of being a porn star or masseuse.  She and Whip bond, move in together, but the bottom line is she's ready to quit her habit, but he's not.<br /><br />Whip is also facing NTSB hearings in regard to the crash, and even though he probably saved a lot of lives was he really fit to be flying that day?  He's lawyered up and the ball's in his court.  Will he tell the truth or will he try to salvage his career?<br /><br />Denzel Washington did a good job  portraying a man who is on a downward slope from which he can't seem to recover.  It isn't until the end that reality starts to set in and he finally is at the realization that he can't control his life and the people that surround him anymore.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This movie was more than I expected. Not disappointed at all. Very visually stunning and will definitely be watching again very soon.

034580404X|5.0|I loved it, it was very well written. I couldnt put it down! I hope however there will be another book written regarding Mr. Grey's personnel story...
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I got this for my husband for Father's Day. He loves it. Sounds like Black Sabbath of the old days with new lyrics. Definitely glad they chose to do this.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I love this game my sister has not been able to get off the app. My kindle has to die or she has to fall asleep. I use the game as a reward for her
0452273331|4.0|I liked the book, read it at my 60, the second time and found it relevant over times and ages.<br />It's most important message - Do not be afraid to be authentic with yourself!!! the only dear thing you have is yourself and your independent mind
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is great if you love fashion and make up. I would prefer this game anytime to anyone it's so fun and amazing
B00992CF6W|4.0|its so fun lots of creapers in survival mode new up is the bucket and cake and spawning eggs for animals needs boats and saddles needs weather
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Man of Steel: Best movie of the freakin' year! This movie is incredible! Finally, a great Superman movie! There has never been an actual good live-action Superman movie until now. If you liked those old Christopher Reeve movies or Superman Returns, then I'm sorry, but you know nothing about Superman. In all the Comics and cartoon, Superman always had very Sci-Fi stuff involved with a lot taking place on other planets with different technology and had a lot of action and destruction. None of this awesomeness happened in those older movies. Instead, a bunch of stupid crap happened, like Superman flying around the world to turn back time and him sleeping with Lois, which he would never do. The series should've been rebooted a long time ago, and finally it has been. This movie is just as good of a reboot as, if not better than, Batman Begins, The Incredible Hulk, and The Amazing Spider-Man. This is the first time I actually felt like Superman in a live-action movie was actually super and awesome and actually had a threat that was worthy of him. And this movie had one of the most exciting and shockingly fantastic climaxes to a movie ever. I don't know how people could not love this film.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie....funny and entertaining!  Loved the music too...watched it several times and found things I missed each time. Recommend it!
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|Don't bother - even for light entertainment.  Some of the worst casting, script and acting you'll see for a while.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Man Of Steel had all the right pieces in place to be groundbreaking. A visual director, strong lead who looks very convincing and a great supporting cast. Unfortunately the few moments that shined were overpowered by haphazard storytelling and a script with little joy. Henry C. was never given enough to really take charge of the movie and put his stamp on it. CG action seemed to be the main focus and a solid story that flowed took a backseat. I enjoyed most of the changes they made, that's not what bothered me, it was they way it was given to us. Any given scene with Clark/Lois/Perry etc. seemed to last about a minute maybe, very hard to get involved in the characters when scenes fly by like that. Again, I thought the movie was decent but they could've utilized these great actors so much more. It seemed they were a means to get to the Star Wars style effects/action scenes. And the movie was really void of any great Superman flying scenes that the 1978 Superman had. I know the creators wanted a fresh take on the genre, but it's Superman, show us a little bit of humanity with the character. I think MOS went overboard and  Superman Returns tried too much to mirror the original. I wish the next time they can find a better balance between the two.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Stunning visuals. Deep and thoughtful content and theme of story. Excellent acting. Great family movie for all to see, and ponder.
B003XE1CU2|5.0|I bought these for my sister and she uses them at work.  She is on her feet all day and she said they are very comfortable and look good with her clothes.
B002YCVWXQ|2.0|This one has me scratching my head.  Well, not really as the plot is about as deep as Paris Hilton's conversational ability.  The acting seems way over the top, the characters stereotypical and the premise...that a recruited squad of Jewish soldiers wreck havoc behind the lines using terror tactics they liken to those of certain Native American tribes.....well,  it IS refreshing at some level to see something not beholding at all to any notion of political correctness.  Guess I just missed the point of this film entirely.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|The JGS was so imaginative, it kept my interest throughout the movie!  I was so impressed with the background music, animation, and dialogue I was mesmerized throughout the two hours.  I did enjoy the after feature news clip about the making of the movie and the character discussion about making the film.  Must keep in library and will always enjoy!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I do like book series and this one is one of my favorite. Two Graves will not disappoint.<br />highly recommend.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always, Khaled Hosseini brings to the reader credible characters that engage an interest and an empathy from start to finish.  The relationships that these characters cultivate with one another, hold as sacred, or lose sight of make up the marrow of the story (the political unrest and military occupation that serves as a backdrop to the story influences these associations but does not bully them).  The story covers the lifetime of it's characters which allows a broad illustration of the permanent repercussions our human choices can effect on us and the ones we hold close. The obstinate will does not always come out victorious.  It is the tender heart that perseveres and is able to withstand the seasons of a lifetime.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|This squeal was an excuse to set up battle scenes. I really enjoyed all the previous Resident Evil movies, but this was rough.
B00C061I3K|1.0|Random Access Memories is disheartening to say the least.  Many of its supporters claim that those of us disappointed with it should just accept that Daft Punk is getting a new sound and just get over ourselves, but just because DP has the right to change their sound doesn't mean that we have to buy and enjoy every single album they do.  We have the right to dislike it.<br /><br />This album is unlike anything that Daft Punk has done, and not in a good way.  It's very tedious.  Most albums will have some sort of movement in their tracks, with a range of faster songs and slower songs all mixed together.  All of the songs on this album are mellow. Listening to the whole thing at once is a chore.<br /><br />In any case, I've been listening to the songs for some time now, so that I could give the album a chance.  People call it \\"experimental\\", but you have to realize that most of it is experimental only for Daft Punk -- most of these sounds have been done before, and done to death.  Specifically, by the plethora of DJs you find in the electronic section of a used music store.  This album would not have sold nearly as well had the name on it not been Daft Punk, as it uses many amateur gimmicks, like pretend meaningful lyrics, over dependence on said lyrics with mediocre tunes in the background, \\"creepy\\" sound effects (Touch), and the usage of astronaut recordings (Contact).  I have heard all these things before.<br /><br />I say that, but not all the songs on this are horrible.  Instant Crush is good, and Lose Yourself to Dance is a good song to play at clubs to keep the dancing going.  The other songs, not so much.  Bring Music to Life, while not the worst thing I've heard, is a terrible album opener.  It doesn't have the energy required to do so.  Touch, Fragments of Time, and Game of Love are all pretty annoying.  Giorgio by Moroder had some potential, but it's ruined for replay value by nearly two minutes of talking.  While people rant and rave about Get Lucky, its words are atrocious, and the song is a gimmicky appeal to mainstream audiences.  I honestly didn't believe that Daft Punk was that immature.<br /><br />Upon first listening to the music samples, I figured Motherboard and Contact to be the best songs.  However, this quickly changed.  Motherboard, to me, sounds like a fairly typical soundtrack song just missing a movie.  On further listening, Contact just felt too typical, and also like a shallow attempt to please the older DP fans on an album clearly not for them.<br /><br />I could go on, but I'll just finish up.  Someone said before that if they wanted to listen to normal music, they would.  We don't need another typical, mainstream band.  We need more music that is unique, and isn't going to succumb to the pressure of pop music disease.  After all, Daft Punk got this far by being weird.  Why would they want to be normal?
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I Love watching this crew of actors with this story line they play them well I enjoy watching them like Bones and other shows...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Totally binding in only a way that Gideon and Eva possess. A breathtaking and gripping read on every single page.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Was very good.  Very entertaining.<br /><br />Not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he was very good in it, would recommend.
1427214948|5.0|My husband and I listened to this book, and the first in the series, during our 17 hour drive from Florida to NH.  Very interesting story and well read audio.  Kept us awake and alert and interested on the long drive.
B003TU167O|4.0|I have been wearing Tevas for the last 20 years.  They haven't changed much, and I don't have a problem with that, but....  I only give them 5 stars as I feel like they have had better designs in years past.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I love WWII books, and this did not fail to give me everything I hoped it would be.  Such a great story, great perspective, well written, and a unique viewpoint from a German fighter pilot.  I highly recommend it!
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I got so bored with this series. I had to make myself read the whole thing and I have forgotten most of what the story line is because I was like... Geez, get on with it already!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Out of all three books, this one was my favorite. I loved it so much. **SPOILERS**<br />Katniss is so not the one~dimensional character some reviewers make her out to be. The way she figured out what the spile was used for? How she cunningly shot her arrow into the force field when she realized what Beetee was going to do? It was brilliant. Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer and I hope to be just like her.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|After seeing the movie, I had to read the book hoping it would help me understand the movie. I liked the ending in the book better. It explains a little bit better.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is amazing. I have only been playing for only 45 minutes and I can give it five stars. Its also awesome because it is free
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I guess with all the hype I expected something else.  It was just ok in my estimation, you might enjoy it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Read in one day, not a lot of wordy distractions that seem so prevalent today, only had to skip 2 or 3 pages.<br />Recommended for all scifi readers, but especially we older folk who can readily identify with the Old Man and his grand adventure.
B0036BK6MW|3.0|I just had problem with curse words. Other than that I enjoyed the message of giving to someone who need hope to reach their destiny.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I think everybody should have this game. It is the best app. I wanted to open a Salon and I have a virtual  Salon.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I rented the movie for my children. I thought it was okay; but some parts were troubling to understand what was going on.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is a awesome game  you get to give her makeup  and stuff it's one of my favorite games it's amazing
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book is the July selection for my book club, and I absolutely loved it.  It was well written, the characters were well developed, and the plot held my attention from beginning to end.  I will look forward to reading other books by Kate Morton, and have recommended this book to several friends already.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game. I actually have not gotten tired of paying yet. The powerups are cool, ad competing with friendsmakes it even cool!
0446573027|3.0|I have mostly enjoyed the Baldacci books I have read.  In Zero Day he makes a pretty good start but kinda fizzles out in the end just like his bomb.  I also agree with other comments that he is kinda like Jack Reacher.  Not that that really concerns me.  A well written story is what keeps me going and I am not too hung up on whether its Mitch Rapp, Scott Harvath, Jack Reacher, Elvis Cole or whomever.  Mr. Baldacci begins with a compelling story and some great suspense.  Unfortunately with 50 or so pages to go he runs outta gas.  He tries to wrap up everything so quickly and neatly and without much explanation except that Puller is just that good.  I'd rather have a conclusion that was less final but was written better any day.  Once I got to the end of this book I found it hard to swallow all that was being given as the reasons behind what had happened.  I was just left disappointed and unsatisfied with the time spent getting to the end.
B000005J48|5.0|I bought because I couldn't find the Milonga in Re anywhere else, which I discovered as PD of an FM station (KCSN in LA) and became haunted, hunted and captured by it.  The rest of the disc is equally satisfying: familiar stuff with great Classical players. Yum!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Downloaded game will not play.  So can't rate it really.  Maybe I will try and download it again.  Looked promising
B000OVLINI|5.0|My new book club chose this book (our first) on the recommendation of an enthusiastic fan.  When I started it I realized I had tried to read it before – and failed, finding it too descriptive, flowery, convoluted, gothic and therefore tedious.  The romantic hyperbole was enough to make me gag!  However, I decided to give it another try so I wouldn’t be a book club drop-out.  Thank goodness I did!  For the first 150 pages or more I was still reading flowery excerpts to my husband such as: “…the storm spilling like rivers of blackened blood between the clouds…” spewing my critical distain.  This kind of language was on every page!  By the time I was 250 pages into the book you could not pry it out of my hands!  I finally got it and was hooked!  While it requires you to suspend belief as the outrageous story unrolls, it ends up being spell-binding and well worth it.  I have not read many books written by Spaniards and translated into English, and perhaps that was why I found it difficult to get into, but the characters, dialog and storyline are terrific, and frankly the very language I ridiculed for the first 150 pages I find myself returning to and absolutely relishing!  A great big wonderful read!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|It was my first movie I viewed on Amazon Prime, the quality was as good as the DVD possibly even better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome app<br />the game is now on0.7.1! and it is amazing now it is awesome app get this app I will give this<br />app 5555555 stars. if I chood!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Cheap, fast delivery, works great! I don't like using lighter fluid. If you've never tried a charcoal chimney, check it out! Safer and healthier than lighter fluid. Charcoal goes in the top, paper (or whatever you want to use as kindling, i use grocery bags) goes in the bottom--cram a bunch of it in there. Light the paper, get it burning well, then just let it burn down for several minutes (while you go prep whatever you're going to throw on there). Then when the coals are glowing you pick it up (the handle on this one is nicer/comfier than the last one I had!) and pour them in your grill. Check it out, consume a few less chemicals.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have read this book about 15 times and it is always as good as the first time I read it. It is my favorite book and it will probably stay that way. I won't give anything about it away but if you don't read this you're missing out on a great fiction book.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I really like the Bourne movies, and on Blue Ray they do not disappoint. The clarity and extra features on these disks make them a must have for any action movie fan. I would highly recommend this box set to anyone with a Blue Ray player and a decent HD tv.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Can't believe this didn't make a bigger splash.  It reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down in the crisp finesse with which it delivers the military drama, although it lacks the stunning soundtrack and reality base of that classic.  And of course the enemies are aliens of the outer space variety, well rendered and designed.  This is one of the top ten 'alien invasion' genre movies, maybe even in the top five. The second half is not as good as the first -- they try a bit too hard to push heroics over believability -- but the package still rates 5/5 stars.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|This was a great movie. I wanted to see it before the new 2013 remake came out. There's nothing like a classic.
0062082353|5.0|A friend loaned me this book, and I am glad that he did. This is not the action filled world of Clancy, Flynn, Thor or others, it is the world of hide sites, over watches and patrols. It is also the world between rotations and family fun and friction both. If you want an honest look at what goes on with the most elite of our military this is peek inside their world. From boredom to the heat of battle and the loss of friends. It is also a look into the woman who stayed home while he went to war. From everything I have seen read and heard Kyle is a humble and dedicated professional. Thanks to the friend who let me borrow this great book about a great American warrior. Since he is no longer with us let say that he will be sorely missed.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Was not sure if this was going to be a good movie or not since it did not last long in the theaters.  It was great.  The action almost never stopped.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|I definitely liked this book better than the last Sookie Stackhouse book. Some things were predictable, some things weren't. It rounded of the story very well.
0062086529|5.0|I read this story to my K1 students about 10 times. They enjoy it even more than I do. I asked the students to draw large pictures of Harold from the story. The out come is a very large book of illustrations drawn by 5 year olds. This book is truly inspirational. Thank you Crockett Johnson.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|It has been a pleasure reading khaled hosseni. The brother sister relationship has been explored in pretty detailed way.Although I did not like the too elaborate account of the character \\"markos\\", however it was  central to the story for it to move forward. The story is no doubt very moving.
141659521X|5.0|As usual Vince Flynn delivers a great novel. Easy to read and a really turn pages. You become convinced that Mitch Rapp is, unfortunately, a fiction character.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|If you like Joe you will love this album.It is great to hear my favorite songs done acoustically. His talent shines through once again.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The collaborations are spot on and well-selected.!  John's new single sure does not disappoint and is done in classic John style.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Great scenery and music -sad if you don't know the novel. Didn't know Russell Crowe could sing-- still don't. Worth a look.
B00400NHRO|5.0|I freaking love this book. I was doing my own internal medicin rotation as I read this. I can totally relate to some of the things in here. Not all tho. And it produced more than a few giggles and LOL's. Almost feel like reading it again.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|the time I watch just goes so quickly, I could easily stand hours and hours of this especially when I'm recouperating from an injury
B001M2CBRK|4.0|Liked the moive clip. I wanted to resume the movie but you people didn't give me enough time to finish the movie.
B0091I7FEQ|4.0|I am an experienced C++ programmer, accustomed to using classes, operator definitions and templates. I am reading this book as a more formal introduction to the new C++ 11 standard after watching a video of Stroustrup presenting an overview of some of the new features introduced by this version of the standard.<br /><br />So far I am only up to section 3.2 of this book. The content is excellent, detailed, and precise in its descriptions.<br /><br />I have not given it a 5 star rating because for some reason this book, and only this book, locks up my Kindle Touch for about 2 to 3 minutes when I start reading the book from somewhere else.  After freezing my Kindle Touch for this period of time, everything seems to go back to normal responsiveness when reading this book, until I leave it, read another book for a while, and come back to reading this one, whereupon it temporarily freezes again.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I started reading the books after watching the HBO series.  Somehow I seem to like the TV dramatization more than the books, since my only complaint is the author has too many wheels spinning and takes too get somewhere.  That said, I do enjoy the story and it keeps me guessing who he is going to kill off after you have invested the time following them.  Hopefully at the end of it all I won't go &#34;That's it!&#34;
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Follet is an author who writes over many subjects and alway hold your interest. If you read Plillars of Earth the you must read this sequel. Be prepared to find a quiet corner for a 1000  page read.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Wish there was more in depth in the characters since this is the last book. Especially at the end where we have Christians side now
0920668364|5.0|Love this book! Was read on Mother's Day when I was in the first grade and I'm 30. This year it was read in my daughter's kindergarten class on Mothers Day brunch. A timeless classic!
B00008J2PG|5.0|an old favorite of mine so glad to have it again in my library.  This generation does not understand whap happened in WW2 but watching this movie could help
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|In Clean Master, App Manager gives me alternative way to uninstall. I can see free storage in device. I can clean up apps for storage but I have not done that yet in fear I will lose important data.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Many have never understood the times and issues of the Civil War.  this is one viewpoint and let's us know how close we were to not abolishing salvery under Lincoln
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|Graphics were great and acting good. The plot was just a little thin but overall I think it is worth a night in.
B00005JLO2|4.0|a good movies not the version I had wanted but want to keep it and look for the other one.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Why I never needed to read this in school in not sure but I'm so glad I decided to. The reading at times I found a bit slow but as the story continued I found myself not being able to put it down. After finishing the book I understand why it is a classic.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I went to the movies to see it first and then had to purchase so I could watch again and again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would give this game to God. It's great for when you are on the go to town or killing bugs.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I enjoy all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  This one was witty, sad & romantic.  I had a hard time putting it down.

0374533555|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read. I intend to come back to this book time and time again to reflect and self-assess my own decisions. Truly a thought provoking book
B00070DK5K|5.0|After losing the spiders from mars I remember thinking where will david bowies musical direction go..DIAMOND DOGS came out with david playing guitar and herbie flowers on bass from his space oddity days .This album was a landmark album so it was only right for his next album to be basically diamond dogs live with some past favorites thrown in.Only one song from diamond dogs is not on this one.Guitarist earl slick takes over for david and you have a totally different sound from his spider days.The album is still full of hard edge riffs but you have more sax from bowie and piano mixed in.I remember thinking wow he changed but his sound still is awesome.Then he came out with young americans and I thought oh my god what a piece of %$(? this album is.anyways, I still love listening to live at the tower even 38 years later.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I watched it 4 times and every time I find something new. There is a message in every scene in this movie and you need to pay lots of attention to understand it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love this game just wish the lives would regenerate faster. Sony like waiting for lives. but I love this game and I am very addicted play everyday n I will continue to play. also there needs to be other ways to get bonuses beaded just the two w coins and the others with gold.............. That is the only things that I see with the game but it is very enjoyable to play. it is a bonus that u play against your friends which makes its even better
B00BESKTMG|1.0|There are bad movies, and then there are really bad movies.  This is a really bad movie and lost my 2 hours in life.
B00A18KCSQ|4.0|The Foals are one of my favorite vocal oriented bands!<br />The music pulls on my heartstrings and I feel the pain of lost love...but alas<br />I am old enough to know that people leave for good reason & this creates room for others to enter!!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I love this new album, I have been following the music videos they put out before the albums release that ended up making a micro-film and the music goes along excellent with it.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Interesting and full of action. There was a lot of creativity used to make the movie and it was well done. The movie was exciting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter plays it every morning. She has a farm with chickens cows pigs and sheep. She has five different world's. Minecraft pocket edition has been the best game my daughter has been introduced to.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|If u don't see it u aren't missing mush its ok in its own right pros good action good plot cons bad acting some parts seem stupid its ok id rent it not buy it
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This is a great love story set in France/England.  The music is fun.  We put this DVD on when we need an &#34;upper&#34;.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, now I want to read the books. Can't wait to see the next movie in the series.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|After seeing the first 4 die hards, I was super excited that theykept going. But this die hard really left something to be desired. The action was good but the story line was just blah.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and shed a tear here and there. Not a blockbuster, but not a disappointment either. Don't regret renting it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Loved this CD, he is a musical genius as far as I'm concerned. play this over and over again. Highly recommend his music.
B000J103WA|4.0|Great live concert! Increddible musicians! This is a must have for any true music fan. My friends that have borrowed it have ordered their own copies. Carl W.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Just seemed to be late on the timing of all the dialog. Never really built you up. Gave it three for the graphics only.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Listening this new Deep Purple work, I was surprised and in the meantime it is just what I was expecting.<br />I explain: after Ritchie Blackmore leaves the band, as happens in 1974, DP was no more real DP.<br />In a band frequently there are members irreplaceable.<br />Deep Purple, is a band in which it is hard to replace one of its members, I talk about the Mk2 lineup that does the history and the path of DP. Blackmore is the one that absolutely is irreplaceable: he has a style, a sound that gives to the DP music some more, some of different, unique.<br />Steve Morse is a first class guitarist, he, probably, also sacrifice some of his style to keep the Blackmore style in the band, but he is not Blackmore.<br />So from Purpendicular onwards, Deep Purple keep this name, but they are a sort of Ian Gillan Band, mixed with Dixie Dregs, Lord and Glover solo.<br />This is what I was expecting and this I had, no surprise by now.<br />I haven¡¦t forget Jon Lord :'(  [R.I.P.] but I have to admit that Don Airey is absolutely majestic, awesome on this album: he honored Lord at the best possible.<br />Now I tell about the surprise.<br />We have to admit that the latest DP works was not to put in the golden gallery of the band.<br />The Battles Rages On, in despite Blackmore was still in the band has some anonymous songs, far from DP standard. In any case the best songs of this album such as Anya, are so awesome that worth to buy the album.<br />Purpendicular was shocking: so different than before but it was, anyhow, a great album very hard to put together the Deep Purple name, but a proof of high class musicians.<br />Bananas is a strange album with some good and some bad, then came Abandon, that probably means that the inspiration abandoned the members of the band, I have never thought that DP can do something worst as Abandon. Then comes Rapture Of The Deep that shows some ideas again, but is anyway an opaque performance.<br />Ok forget everything: in Now Wath ?! they do their best, the ideas and the creativity are boiling faster and huge in this album, they recover all the sonority, the passages, that makes the Purple music unique.<br />It seems again a real new \\"Deep Purple\\" album (apart the absence of Blackmore....)  ;)<br />Is a must have, enjoy it! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have always wanted to play minecraft but didn't have the money for the pc version but now it is easier and I love it
1594489505|5.0|very heartfelt and real. opens your mind to a completely different world. i could read this again and again. definitely wont be selling it
B000056VJ7|5.0|I have always loved this CD, but never owned it.  I finally decided to order it for myself, and I'm glad I did.  It came a lot sooner than I expected, and I'm very happy with it.
B001514J6O|5.0|super cute movie. friendly for all ages, hope to see more to come i could watch this over and over!
B00D6M86RS|5.0|I LOVE IT. IM ADDICTED. I have all free and paid for apps on pinball and this one is the one. Please throw all your old apps away cuz with this one all your searching is over!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|enjoyed the game it was challenging... but fun and relaxing to play...the music also helped you to relax while getting through the levels
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game I don't know how to describe it the graphics are better than they would be on a Polaroid tablet it's a perfect game. If you like Temple Run then you would love Subway Surfers. Also it has its own \\"world tour\\".It brings you to Japan-Miami-Sydney EVERYWHERE!!!!! It is an awesome app.[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Yup. Don't need words or sound really.. Just watch. :) the movie and enjoy. It's one of those kind of movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I could not put it down. I will read it over and over again love it!
B009GESJH2|4.0|I am a Kidd Rock lover, and this was a good CD, but after Rock N Roll Jesus, its just hard to top that
0811874192|5.0|This book would make an excellent table display on a formal dining room table. it is beautifully done and a real prize winner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good game but  I wish that people would stop making games that were based on the same thing but are actually horrible remakes of minecraft
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|You go back and re-read 50 Shades for closure.<br /><br />Ms. Day, you need to work with your editor a bit more closely and tighten this ship up before you loose more of your fans. We deserve a little bit more [credit] than this book gave don't you think? You're more talented than this book demonstrates and if there must be 5, then please make it worth our while...
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Came even earlier than expected. Can't wait for season three to come out on dvd! I dont mind shareing my thoughts on the product but needing 15 words is quite annoying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very entertaining but didn't realize the game only has 8 rooms/ levels. can't wait for more this was a real great time waster
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i. love it so good of a game I can play it all day maybe every day for now on
1619695006|5.0|I listened to this book as a book on CD, so I may have some names misspelled, but I felt it was one of the best fiction books I have encountered in many years.  It is not Harry Potter (It is not even close to it, but is a whole different type of book) , but the plot, character studies, and the interactions of the people involved in it are as good or better than what you find in Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.  JK Rowling has done a superb job of looking below the pretty, peaceful surface of the village of Pagford, and has shown it is really a seething cauldron of interacting characters, who attack, take advantage of, and support one another in a variety of ways.  And, the touch at the end, where Howard Mollison's favorite song &#34;The Green, Green, Grass of Home&#34; in which a man awakes to find his homecoming to his lovely old home town was nothing but a dream, and the reality is that this is the last morning of his life on death row, is a beautifully done touch as a foreshadowing of what will happen next.  In the next 24 hours, the dreams of many of the characters are shown to be just dreams and are replaced by reality, either better or worse than their dreams.  I think this book deserves to be one of the English classics, and it certainly shows what a great writer JK Rowling is.
B006LSZECO|2.0|it wasn't a bad book.  Just quite weird in its structure and content.  Makes me wonder about how messed up the author is.  If i knew what i know now before having read the book, i would not spend my time reading it.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Worked as it should . I would reccomend buying it . Easy usb plug in and all drivers are included or can be easily found on line.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|My grandkids wanted to play this game while visiting, so we downloaded the app.  I have not used it since so cannot comment on it personally.  I don't use it and plan to delete it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I personally enjoyed Jurassic Park Builder as I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park. It is well worth it to be downloaded.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I did not think I would like this book.  I have to be honest.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised!  I loved it.  Not only is it a very interesting story with a very unique world, it was full of adventure and intrigue.  Also a hot romance.  The story is far from fluff.  It's very deep.  Your emotions will get a real workout.  The world the author has created is ingenious.  The characters are very real in the sense that relationships don't just magically happen without complications along the way.  I am so pleased I took a chance on reading this.  The plot is very very intense.  You will love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book, Catching Fire, was astounding and was a heart stopper during many times. I would recommend this book to everybody ten and over.
B00821OW8K|2.0|It was just way to stereotypical and cliche, everything from the set design to the characters and the plot.  Boring.
B002ZG994U|4.0|I watched it like two times in the first night. It was amazing. I really enjoyed it especially Liam Neeson's performance.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|it is ok its a lot like temple run.  buy it and you will see. I do not like it.
0810983915|5.0|This book was a library replacement for the one my son lost.  It was in excellent condition and arrived on time.  I couldn't have found a better deal.  Thanks, Amazon!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Things is a  game. I'm currently on my second time through the game. Super ready for the sequel! Can't get enough of the game!!!!!!!!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Story was original with marvellous characters. I loved it. He was amusing, laugh out loud funny & a character that would be hard to not love. All his Projects were wonderful.
111846446X|4.0|Good basic book for the RaspBerry Pi.  give lots of details for the Pi and a good book to start.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|The Action was good. It had a slightly different feel that the other Die Hards.<br />If you have watch the others in the series you should watch this one.<br />The opening car chase with that Russian personel carrier is awesome.
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|I love the way vinyl records sound. The sound is so rich & multidimensional. Like the music - some sounds like classic Bowie, some more orchestral. A quality item.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I did not read the other reviews for this third installment but regardless I would have read it anyway.  I loved the first 2 books in this series and like others I was anxiously awaiting the continuation of Eva and Gideon.  I am giving it 1 star because I have to agree with the THOUSANDS of other reviewers that the ending was a HUGE disappointment.  REALLY???? I'm sad that Sylvia Day felt the need to drag this out with 2 more installments just to profit from it.  The book basically just ends with no real lead in to the next installment.  Shame on you Sylvia for dragging this series out like H.M. Ward did in Secrets. Again, 5 volumes?? Why not just be honest and tell the readers, by the way, you'll have to pay again after so many chapters.  The term that comes to mind is rip-off...
B003GK223E|4.0|I was a Jeffrey Archer fan 30 years ago and for some reason drifted away.  In my second 'Kindle Year' and re-discovered Jeffrey Archer.  He hasn't lost the touch and this was definately a page-turner.
0789723107|5.0|Steve writes clearly with minimal jargon and uses examples we can all relate to.  Short and sweet - he's opened my eyes to better design and how to make electronic formats easier and more fun for users.  Definitely a keeper on the bookshelf !
B000W4SE6G|4.0|It almost feels like a portfolio of human beings' influence on nature, which can vary from uplifting to disturbing. The music fits the scenes in some way but would not be as powerful on its own.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|You need to get the free app doodle text to edit documents and pics.<br />Its mostly okay but I don't know why they have word,exel,and powerpoint on there if you can't do them unless you install the pro.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This movie is so well done - you will positively fall in love with Wall-E, Eve and Captain B. McCrea.  It's a really good story that makes you think about what all our computerization and technology may turn us into someday.  You will cheer for Wall-E.  My 12-year-old son and I still enjoy it immensely.  I would highly recommend it for anyone of any age.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Eye opening life changer.  Although some parts of it border on obsessively detailed information (which made me lose focus a bit), it is chock full of information that makes a whole lot of sense.  Everyone should read this book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is so well done, and all the characters are just great.  Special props to Jack McBrayer as Fix-It Felix and Jane Lynch as Sargeant Calhoun.  It is really a sweet story about how everyone wants to belong and find love and friendship.  My 12-year-old son and I watched it together and enjoyed it immensely.  I highly recommend it for anyone of any age!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|It was with some concern that after reading some reviews with poor audio quality and other problems that I made this purchase with some trepidation. After getting through about half the seiers in volumetric order I can detect no audio or any other issues with these DVD's or the program contained therein.<br />I highly reccomend this set to my fellow grognards with tempered opinion that, the winners write the history and I believe that no country is innocent of propoganda's darker side. Therefore I feel it is up to the person do do their own investigations as to the truth or lack thereof any source may imply, before drawing conclusions.
B005MLP91C|5.0|This movie is so clever - but what else would you expect from Jerry Seinfeld?  My son and I have watched this movie several times (he is now 12, and we just watched it again recently) - and we both enjoy it immensely.  It's funny, of course, but also makes you think about how all creatures have a place in our ecosystem.  All of the supporting cast is great as well - with special props to John Goodman as counsel for the defense and Chris Rock as the misquito.  There are many stars with great parts - including Sting and Ray Liotta.  You will just love this movie!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|she is so good, so much better than Taylor swift, who wins so many awards, glad to see in today,s news, Adele won a bunch, and one from the Queen . My grandson,s little band plays rolling in the deep, and all the kids love it!!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I love everything about this movie!  The story is so good and very funny, but touching as well.  Ellen DeGeneres just steals the show as Dory.  It has so many great messages, including human treatment of marine life and parents &#34;not letting anything happen&#34; to their kids.  It's a great father and son movie - my 12-year-old son still enjoys it immensely.  I would very highly recommend this film for anyone of any age.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|on Dancing with the Stars one evening, they danced to his song If I were your Man, and I fell in love with his voice, had to have a whole album, which I love, and  want more.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Excellent! Am an intense fan, and this really fed my appetite for this series. Arrived in perfect condition. Would recommend highly for all fans of the series.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is an all-time classic that is especially worth reading on Kindle or Kindle-for-PC because of the lookup features. Victor Hugo's vocabulary is amazing and the reader is constantly challenged to expand their own knowledge of language. What is even more amazing is how Hugo can weave a tale that is both relevant and absorbing to modern audiences, even after almost two centuries. The book gives a great perspective on social issues that directly addresses today's tendency towards cynicism and hopelessness in dealing with the relentless pounding by the news media that only seems to produce more bad news. The reader is taken into a world within themselves where time stops and the insight into human issues begins.
B003CMGE2Q|3.0|One of Depp's early films, possibly before he started having any control over the script. Beautiful acting jobs by all the principals, but suffers from an almost incomprehensible script. Depp's character winds up in a nest of loonies who should have had keepers. Have not watched it enough times yet to where it makes sense, assuming it will at some point. Bought it because I am a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, and am collecting all of his movies. Perhaps this is simply a case of my having a different sense of humor than the director did; or perhaps it would be better watched after a drink or two. Still, am glad to have it in my collection.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|IF you decide to read this book, keep track of all the characters from the beginning, as it turns out, some have the same names and by the ending it was rather confusing! I liked the description of the culture and habits, interesting and informative. But the story wove in and out of so many locations, I had trouble knowing where I was.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Delightful series, as always. Arrived in perfect condition, despite the heat here in the desert--even after sitting in 110 degrees in a metal mailbox for several hours before I could get home to retrieve it! Plays beautifully. I would definitely recommend this to any Big Bang Theory fan.
0307730697|5.0|Great book.  Keeps you on your toes and really wants you to read til finished.  Could not be written any better.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Amazing how the writers, cast, etc., have kept this series fresh and compelling. Found it delightful. Arrived in perfect condition, well-packaged. Would recommend this to any Big Bang fan.
0062082353|5.0|The intensity in this book will keep you reading.  This man was truely a bada** even though he didnt think so.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Excellent, as always. Arrived in perfect condition, and have been enjoying it greatly. The characters are all well-developed and easy to identify with, and I appreciate the quality of the writing and the intelligent approach to ordinary problems.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|If you love Lady Antebellum, you will love this on. Golden, which is the title of their new album, is really great and touching. I love this group.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Another Disney classic! The animation is fantastic, the story line is fun and well developed, and the character voices are fantastic!  James Woods portrayal of Hades in this film is one of the most entertaining voice-overs ever done (with the help of great characterization by the animators!)  And the other voices are what help make this film a lot of fun (again, with great characterization of the animators).  I also found this useful as a supplement when teaching my children about Greek mythology--as you do learn about Hades, and Hydra, Zeus, The Titans, Cerebrus, Hercules, Achilles, etc.  It's a nice elementary introduction to some of the characters for young ones (K-4), so we found it helpful. A fun way to learn a bit (although, just a &#34;bit&#34;) of Greek mythology.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Willow is very well done.  Details are sharp and colors are vibrant.  Sometimes converting an older movie to hi-def has the unintended side effect of making the special effects stand out.  Not so in Willow.  They hold up surprisingly well, especially since this film was made 25 years ago.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|It was a fun watch, this was my 2nd watching it. I saw it first at the theater.<br /><br />I actually streamed this via Verizon LTE (Amazon App for iPad), barreling down the interstate from Nashville TN to Asheville NC.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Just wow, I went to the movie's twice already to see this Superman, just early on today when the movie ended the crowd erupted in applause!!!! My 36 year old brother gave it a solid 8 out of 10, while my buddy I was with kept saying \\"wow I cant believe how amazing that movie was\\". My father must have said to me 10 different times \\"That movie was excellent excellent excellent!\\".  First thing my sis said to me leaving the theater is \\"That movie was really good!\\".<br /><br /> I have took 17 people to see this movie at the theater already with 100% positive feedback!  This Superman is emotional, lost, and on a mission to find out who he is. Once he does though he is a MAJOR ASSKICKER!!!!<br /><br />  The director Zack Snyder stated that the final cut of the movie was 3 hours 20min long, he had to cut a full hour of scenes from this movie for its theatrical release. That would be my only complaint,  you can tell there was originally more to this movie as some scenes seem rushed through, like how Superman finds the fortress of solitude, it happens so quick you know there was much more to these scenes in the original directors cut.  I'm just praying that they include all this extra footage on the BluRay once released, I'd be the happiest man on earth!<br /><br />All in all 5 Stars!  It really is a ride you do not want to miss!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE/EDIT:<br /><br />My list of Best Superman Movies...<br /><br />#1: MAN OF STEEL!!! Just hoping/Praying that Snyder includes the hour lost in post production on BluRay!<br />#2: Superman 2 Donner Cut<br />#3: Superman 2 Theatrical Release<br />#4: Superman 3<br />#5: Superman 4<br />#6: Superman Returns

B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is great. I love this series. I would recommend it to everyone I know. Nathan Fillon some good looking man. the interaction between characters is great. Kevin Ryan is a complicated man.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I just had a hard time watching this season because I was so tired of the companion. I'm sad to see the Doctor change but its part of the show.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for Season 6, even though I think I know how it is going to go. I've been a Nathan Fillon fan since Firefly. Yum Yum some good looking man. The charcters are great together.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great start to the series and is very enthralling. A warning though, do not expect to read this easily in short bursts as it is very hard to put down!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm not sure why everyone is so disappointed....quite frankly I'm not ready to let go of Gideon and Eva! I loved it and the hanger :)
B00785P2QC|3.0|Really fun to play.  Like Megapolis much better than this one.  It is still fun to play.  Had to start over once.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This Star Trek movie collection is perfect for any fan out there. Love it, purchased it for my dad for Father's Day.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Great app. Love the math feature. Nothing to get you up in the morning like having to do arithmetic at 5am. Best alarm clock I've ever had.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Have watched it over and over again.  Love the whole scenaro...hated when they killed harmless people. Love her teaching him and calling him a &#34;baby&#34; :)

0439023521|5.0|It was a gift for my grand daughter.  She has already read it at least 4 times or more. The price was good.
B00920HMNM|4.0|I purchased this on the 180 gram vinyl as I have re-awakened my old vinyl.<br /><br />The music and the dynamics are great. This album was well produced and mastered. The clear vinyl was also ver cool. The only downside to clear vinyl (i have others as well) is that it is very difficult do distinguish the space between songs when trying to queue. It is easy to see them on the other side of the record as well. This is the first time I had a 180 gram record mastered on 2 LPs that only used 3 sides. kind of cool.<br /><br />Slinky Thing is a smooth song with a groove. Memerablia is good but a bit repetitive. I love the song Weather in My Head. I can relate to this song very well. Miss Marlene is remenisant to the old Steely Dan days.<br /><br />Whether you like Donald's music or not, this album is a great listing experience. It's hard to listen to and not get you toes a tappin'.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that there were quite a few pops and clicks. When purchasing a new vinyl record, you expect it to be very clean.
0439023513|1.0|***Minor Spoilers***<br /><br />I absolutely loved \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" but \\"Mockingjay\\" was a huge disapointing conclusion to the series. I completely agree with the other One-star reviewers that Collins' writing in this last one was very sloppy and confusing. I had to re-read paragraphs over and over, just to understand what was going on. There were way too many deaths and all were emotionless. The triangle between Gale, Peeta, and Katniss seemed like an after thought once you get past all the deaths and the action that was way too rushed. The ending was the most disapointing thing in the book (That's saying something.) The characters are seperated,(most dead)and Gale's character seems like a side-thought. He just \\"leaves\\", as if Collins wanted to get rid of all the characters and end the series as quick as possible.<br /><br />Stick with \\"The Hunger Games\\" & \\"Catching Fire\\". I just pretend this book never happend.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|New agents, the Nutty Professor complete with babysitter/lab assistant set in an archaic Harvard Lab complete with Jean the cow. Tie it all together with an intense FBI sergeant and you have a twisted good time.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This book rang so true to me - from the descriptions of African hair braiding salons to the egotism of wealthy 3rd worlders - Adichie described my world so vividly, and I'm not even Nigerian. This book is an excellent look at the intersections of race, class and gender as they are felt and expressed on both sides of the Atlantic.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I LOVE Michael.  This album is okay.  There are a few songs that I really like, but this is not my favorite album.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I've been a Thor fan since childhood comic days. This movie did a great job on keeping my perception of Thor alive. He's powerful, yet unmistakably human with all the complexities that come with that combination. It got a little surreal in a few spots, but hey, this is  a movie about the gods we're talkin' about here.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I saw them on TV and just fell in love.  Their music is so soothing and pretty.  I never thought I would like this kind of music, but I really do.  I especially like to have it playing on my computer while I am working.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite books! Makes you appreciate life more then ever!!! Worth reading atleast once!!!!
B009O2XY12|4.0|The only bad thing about this game? You can't buy it, so when you run out power, you have to pay ,<br /><br />and that's how they get your money.....
B005LAII8A|3.0|Looper is a time travel film that is absolutely exciting to watch. Unfortunately, the script plays loose with logic to the point that even normal everyday non-physicists see the glaring loopholes in the story. In one clear example, the future assassin kills a young woman while wounding the jaw of her son. When the younger present-day assassin then kills himself, the woman returns to life since the event technically never happened (i.e., the younger assassin never grew into the older Bruce Willis), yet her younger son's jaw remains injured. Die-hards will try to find other reasons for the still-injured jaw, but in my opinion a good film shouldn't require viewers to struggle to make sense of it. There are many such contradictions throughout the film. Still, the film is fun to watch if you can just ignore the silliness (glaring contradictions).
B00AK57N00|3.0|Crazy game but fun to pass the time at lunch. It was free so I had to try it. Mr. Ash is a cute little guy.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|Natural Born Killers showcases murder in America in a &#34;pulp fiction&#34; manner, making it seem cool to live on the edge of all the media-fueled hatred & anger in our society. You can especially feel this reality when listening to Tommy Lee Jones character talk; the hatred seems to boil beyond annoyance, almost to the point of being a comfortable rumbling in new-age music. I came away from the film feeling exonerated at -- & remembering the reasons for -- my attempts to let go of all the hate & anger that surround's our lives & culture.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Similar to other romantic movies, but I really enjoyed this one! Great story, well written story, superb acting.Definitely a keeper! I will give this one a chick flick rating great!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The Impossible was incredibly done, giving the average viewer the feeling of actually being caught in the Tsunami & the immediate aftermath. I'd always wondered how anyone -- other than perhaps kids, old, & the disabled -- could be killed by a tidal wave; I mean, you see the water coming & you run! The Impossible demonstrates the reality & degree of surprise such an event (i.e., tsunami) can have on anyone unfortunate enough to be in its path. And like a tornado, much of the danger is collateral to the water, with trees, objects, etc., being hurled with incredible force & speed into everyone & everything. The family this film is centered on is extremely lucky, not only to have survived with all their limbs & senses intact, but also to have found each other; I can't help but tear up when I think of the 300,000+ people who lost their lives & the hundreds or perhaps thousands of kids who ended up either parentless or missing but presumed alive (e.g., from sightings & second-hand reports).
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. It was beautiful and very unusual. It was different and stands out. I wasn't sure about buying it but make no mistake it was a good choice.
B008220DGE|5.0|Though The Master never explicitly mentions either Ron Hubbard's name or the term Dianetics, it is obvious from the gitgo that the film centers around Scientology. The Master remarkably portrays Scientology's allure, demonstrating how certain mental exercises along with a willingness to question one's cultural programming can actually calm them & help them to enjoy life more. The film also demonstrates, however, that like Karl Marx's seemingly perfect disposition of utopia, it is inherent in our human nature that most of us -- absent a real humanist passion -- submit to greed & corruption when giving a chance (e.g., having complete control over others).
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This, like many others have complained about, does stop ticking let's say when there is absolutely no light to power it. This becomes frustrating in the sense of keeping track of time. Otherwise, it is a great watch and very versatile. It can be used in shower in case you forget to take it off and hands do light up in low light.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good LOVE story. Connor sounds so seductive and sexy. You can not help but want Megan to win his heart.
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|Great suspense and plot twists!<br />Would recommend highly for folks with teenagers as this will keep them on the edge of their seats without gratuitous sex and violence.  Only a little grisly!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|A good read, but a bit predictable.  Probably wouldn't read another Grisham book though - if they all end with these type of predictable happy endings?
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So peaceful to help me fall asleep...I work early so it helps me relax for the night.  The timer is great.

B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I read this book years ago and am re-reading it because of a life circumstance.<br /><br />I believe in God. I read the Bible and try to follow its principles. But to KNOW there are some of us who do actually make the transition and are able to come back and tell what it is like, is amazing and wonderful.  It's fulfilling and I was overwhelmed with love just reading this book.  It gives me comfort in times I have questions and somehow I know what Ms. Eadie imparts to us is real!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|An amazing puzzler with stunning graphics. Myst like puzzles and an engaging plotline... amazing work from fireproof games.  Looking forward to continuing the series.  Puzzles are not too hard but some definite head scratchers.
0988178532|5.0|This was the perfect choice for my first true \\"summer read\\" of 2013. With a plot and characters in constant motion, it covered all my favorite esoteric topics. The characters were young enough that they weren't yet jaded, and smart enough to know when they were in trouble. Nate Ryder starts his walk on the spiritual path at a full out run, with more courage and support than most of us, but also far more danger. Such a fun read!
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I loved \\"Wild\\" and Cheryl's experiences walking the PCT have made me more resolved to finally walk the Camino in Spain.

1609611543|2.0|I heard about the GMO problem with our foods, especially wheat so I was very interested to read what William Davis had to say. The history and science of how wheat has come to be something totally different than it was 50 years ago is fascinating. But implementing the wheat free diet was a different story.<br /><br />I began going wheat free June 1 and it is now June 16 and feel I must stop the diet. The pros, many of the recipes are very tasty and based mostly on vegetables are also very healthy. The cons, it's very expensive to obtain all the special oils, ground coconut, flaxseed and nut flours. I had to go to four different stores to find it all i.e. Sprouts, Smiths, Fresh & Easy and Whole Foods. The flavors of muffins and anything with the artificial sweetener Dr. Davis suggested, had a bitter after taste. But most of all, my system can't handle the low fiber results of eating this way. Even though I had lots and lots of vegetables, water and allowed grains, my digestion did not work well and I've gained 3 pounds. On the other hand my husband has enjoyed the food and is feeling fine. So my answer is to adapt the parts that worked for me while listening to my body to tell me what it needs.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Ralph&#34;s quest to become a hero. Leads him on an adventure not only to help himself but thoughts around him. Even thoughts he use to hate. This is a wonderful story of a true hero.

1781162646|4.0|I know he's a good writer, puts words together just fine, but his stories don't work for me.  Mostly.  I like his short stories (ok, I know there's no money in short stories, ask Harlan Ellison) and I've never read \\"Shawshank\\" which I might like (I liked the movie).  I was told to read \\"Salem's Lot\\" and so I finished it, but I didn't enjoy a minute of it.  But I liked \\"The Colorado Kid,\\" even without any ending, so I ordered this one and guess what?  It's terrific.  You don't need me to tell you the plot, read the other reviews.  I don't believe his character (or anybody else) could find a croissant on the NC coast in October of '73, let alone a warm one.  He talks blithely about driving to Lumberton (which nobody would) or Myrtle Beach (2 hours each way), so I don't believe he was in NC in '73 (maybe ever), or that he bothered with the research (the USA wasn't quite as homogenous then as it is now), but it doesn't really matter.  I don't really believe in ghosts, either.  But I think Donald Westlake would have appreciated it, and it has the light touch of the supernatural Neil Gaiman fans might appreciate.  Read it.  It won't take long.  Good book.
1439190275|4.0|I have been on Atkins on and off for many years.  I highly recommend it for folks who need to lose over 20 lbs.

0525478817|5.0|I prolonged reading this one. I knew it was going to be good - not only because of the rave reviews I'd been hearing, but also because the subject matter was a tough one to tackle. And yet, I let it sit in my TBR pile for three months, while I stalled and read other books.<br /><br />cancer touches many lives, and everyone deals with it differently. What I found amongst those pages, was an exceptional story - and while beautifully written, it was tremendously bittersweet. Anyone who has had even a glimpse into this devastating disease, can completely relate to how raw and heartbreaking this journey truly was.<br /><br />The relationship between Hazel and Augustus from start to finish, was nothing short of believable - full of emotion, yet flavored throughout with well-timed humor, as the two made their way through such unfortunate circumstances. Neither of them gave credit to their cancer - it simply was what it was, and they both dealt with the hand they were given, in the best way they knew how.<br /><br />You may have noticed (or not?) that I didn't capitalize the c in the word cancer, anywhere above - and that's because I don't believe it deserves that kind of credit or attention. One day we'll figure out how this horrible disease takes over the human body, metastasizes throughout, and ultimately, takes the ones we love. And we'll stop it. Until then, it's exceptional books like THE FAULT IN OUR STARS that makes you realize, it doesn't matter who you are or what your age is, in the end, cancer affects us all.<br /><br />John Green is a master at story-telling; a true artist in the way he delivered a journey that could have gone in a non-favorable direction, all too easily. A FAULT IN OUR STARS was an excellent read and a favorite YA contemporary for me - this is one I highly recommend to everyone.ut, and ultimately, takes the ones we love. And we'll stop it.

B007FLHW3K|5.0|Arty fun bling for your bike. Fits just fine on my 20\\" folding bike's wheels (attaches with zip ties, comes with a metal locking tie for extra security.) Super bright LEDs (dimmable for battery life), durable waterproofed construction, runs all winter commute season on a set of AA alkalines. Just leave it on auto and you will be dazzled by its constantly changing, rich color patterns, be sure to not run into anything while you stare at it!  No cheesy expensive coin cell batteries or dim cheapo LEDs, this is for serious bedazzlers only!

0894803123|4.0|This book by Ben & Jerry distills how easy it is to make great ice cream.  It's all about the ingredients, and they do a great job of showing three different bases for varying degrees of richness and taste, and then building on those for delicious fruit, chocolate, sundae, etc. ice cream treats.  Includes the stories and recipes behind some of the biggest and well-known Ben & Jerry brand products like Cherry Garcia, Heath Bar, etc.  It's a good value at the Amazon price, and in the last two weeks, friends and family keep asking how the ice cream I've made is so good.  I would give it five stars, but I think it could use an update to reflect more current B & J flavors.
B005HED1BE|4.0|The show is very dated, but fun to watch for any Star Trek fan.  Watching these brings me back to when I was a kid and watched the show.

B003Z49LYO|5.0|Well done, well acted and just a great story. This is a great short series. Gemma is beautiful as her character.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|This movie and the subsequent two are magical.  Also, I love the fact that my kids enjoy them too.  Worth watching time and time again!!

B0081YBD8A|5.0|I found the first of this series really good and wanting for more!then the second series I felt didn't live up to the first but them they were made two years apart and it felt like the cast had moved on to other things and everyone was just trying to fill a need for the fans to fisish what they started in the first series.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I have been wanting this product for a long time and it came in early and was in great condition.  The description was great about the product and the movie of course was enjoyable in my opinion.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|David Sedaris holds this strange place in my heart. On some levels hes an idol of mine, while I do not aspire to be a writer, or really follow in any of his footsteps his cutting analysis of every day occurrences i find FASCINATING and completely enrapturing to read.  On the other hand I get this odd feeling looking at his books, like I'm a voyeur in a life I maybe shouldn't be looking in.<br /><br />Anyways I cannot get enough of David Sedaris, I love this book, and I love seeing how his writing continues to change and evolve. Read this one, read all of em.
B00BYISQTO|4.0|This is a accumulation and a logical... well maybe not logical, but an emotional conclusion to their work so far. A calmer, more confident album, but nonetheless polished work of art, from a band that have never disappointed.
B001DHXT6G|1.0|The 'cool' cases arrived cracked and falling apart.  Since we were interested in the DVDs and not the cases, that was not a deal breaker.  However, once we tried to watch them we discovered that the first disc of the first season was scratched so badly that it did not play every episode.  This is when we decided to return them.  The item was obviously damaged before it was shipped as the packaging did not appear damaged.  This was very disappointing as this was a birthday gift for my son.  If you order these, I would suggest that you inspect all discs upon arrival for scratches.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Pretty good job turning a good action book into an action movie.  Didnt like cruise as the lead, but he actually did a good job.  Not going to win any awards, but a decent action flick and a pretty good rendition of the book One Shot.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I appreciated the back story to the Wizard of Oz. Visually it was appealing and the storyline was pretty good.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Though the story itself is not at all new, we're talking basic ideas of socialism, the book quite swiftly puts the dots on the i's and crosses the t's. Deeper meaning of the book, the thought, Drive is choose your attitude, commit to something you want to do for the rest of your life.. strive for mastery, and be aware that you'll never going to reach it. I've recommended the book to many colleagues and will keep on doing this for quite some time.
0375869026|5.0|Our teacher started reading this to our fifth grade class.  I liked it so much, I got my own copy.<br /><br />I liked it because it is a different kind of book.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is the app to use when listening to internet radio. You can schedule it, record and pause.. perfection.<br /><br />Stupidly, idiot networks like Cumulus have made it so you have to use their app to listen to their stations (see my review of i heart radio).<br /><br />However, TuneIn excels and blows it away. Recording radio on a schedule and pausing radio are the killer features for this app.<br />Hands down.<br />I use it while shopping and even driving via BT in the car. It's *better* than live radio because they're no static. Getting gas? No prob, just pause the radio and hit play when you get back in.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game. but seems to act up on my kindle and takes forever to load. wish making friends was easier.
B008CX2A2I|4.0|Not much to say - it doesn't just what you need it to do. The range is adequate, too.<br />If you get the 525, 626, or 727 I think it has BT built in.<br />I have the 616 and man do I love that thing.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I liked it - could've been a little better - we all know what happens next but it would've been nice to have them end the movie leading us on.

B001BZRUR4|5.0|While technically considered a young adult book, this is a book that is supple enough and applies broadly enough to be recommended to readers of any age from high school on up. \\"I Am the Messenger\\" is another marvel of Markus Zusak, albeit in a different vein entirely from \\"The Book Thief\\" - here, the story isn't about growing up in a war-torn environment, but rather coming to know one's own abilities, and the things we can do for those around us.<br /><br />To say more about the plot of the book would give too much away - suffice to say that the book is beautiful, touching, and simultaneously lighthearted. It may sneak up on the reader to catch their breath sometimes.<br /><br />Truly, a book to read and re-read.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|I love this movie!To be honest I have never watched the original yet.The acting is great in this movie!It is fun to watch.This is one movie I have watched before and I know I will watch it again.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|The movie arrived in a timely fashion.  I don't know if it is all blue-ray movies...but part way through the movie stops and we have to mess with it to get a spot we can continue with the movie.  Just annoying.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|This is a well acted movie.It is based on a true story about Teena Brandon.Hilary Swank is awesome in this movie.It is disturbing how society in general doesn't accept people based on their sexuality.Teena Brandon was a transgender.She identified with being a male although she was born female.She was raped and badly beaten and the cop questioning her seemed more interested in her sexuality than the crime itself.Some of this was disturbing to watch and more so because it is true.I'm not going to spoil the movie if you haven't seen it yet.But if your interested in watching a \\"hate \\"crime movie then this is for you.Teena Brandon tried to hide her identity but I think it was because of all the negativity that surrounded her.I just realized I am saying \\"her\\".I really should be saying \\"him\\".It is graphic and has sex scenes and is not for younger viewers.I do recommend this movie.It does leave you feeling sad though.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think this game is a lot of fun. I have always enjoyed playing solitaire and its even more fun playing it on my Fire.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing.  Just wish there was more ways to win the prizes in the rooms.  More shadow cards.  Less credits for rooms.  More credits you can receive from friends
B000W93CHC|1.0|The best thing I can say about this book is that it is only a sequel and not part of a trilogy. I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, so bought this book in all innocence looking forward to a return to Knightsbridge and the cathedral town. After a long slog, I fearfully checked Amazon to see if there is another book. I was afraid it was part of a trilogy. I am so relieved that I will not have to fight the temptation to read another book set in this city. RIP Knightsbridgeans. May you never rise again to trouble my reading life.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Pretty much what you would expect.  Good picture quality Indian Jones Movies.<br /><br />Me and the old lady love them and watch them when the mood hits us.<br /><br />Nice packaging and I believe all 4 movies are in there even thought the 4th one was kind of hoakie.  .
B007T2XC7A|1.0|Her other album was so laid back and light hearted. This one was depressing and had a different feel to it. I didn't really like it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have always liked fish games...but this is one of the better ones.  The educational side is awesome as are the graphics and music.  I know it is more geared toward children but really enjoy Nemo' s Reef!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry birds and Star Wars, what could be better? This does not disappoint.  My kids could play this all day.  Even my husband, a Star Wars expert, approves.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I know others raved about it but I found the story in itself very good but the writing somewhat redundant of certain themes.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|There is so much to say about Kimbra and this album, it is literally a party for my ears. Her songs have a vintage style with a touch of electric pop and forms perfectly. Though you cannot really categorize this album under any genre, my best guess would be something like Jazz, Indie, and retro pop. This album is quite different from a lot of albums out today because all the songs are so different.<br /><br />Okay, moving onto the actual songs. My personal favorites are Settle Down, Cameo Lover, Call Me (deluxe edition), and Good Intent. All the songs are jewels so it was hard to pick just a few.<br /><br />Settle Down- A classy tune with beautiful flow and harmony. It's really addicting because her voice is so smooth and unique, so watch out!! It also does not sound like typical pop music. Settle Down is a vintage jazzy tune with a modern twist.<br /><br />Cameo Lover-Cute party song with interesting lyrics. Extremely catchy, and this one particularly sounds like a 1960's song, but Kimbra puts a modern tough on it that's quite hard to describe. It's like vintage styled clothing. It's not true vintage, but it looks like it, and it was made in modern times. Truly amazing!<br /><br />Call Me-Though it can only be found on the deluxe version, it is surely worth listening to. This is an R&B type hit that will make you wanna get up and clap. It's so catchy and her lyrics are so cute!<br /><br />Good Intent-Man, this song is just awesome. The lyrics are a little mysterious but it's so smooth and jazzy. This time, Kimbra takes us back to the 1930's and again puts her magic touch on it. It may be the most artsy song on the album, with much elegance and flow, it's just perfect.<br /><br />Three words: BUY THIS ALBUM! She is an AMAZING musician, nothing fake about her and she sounds the exact same live. You won't regret buying this and most likely you will become a big Kimbra fan. Cannot wait for more of her stuff to come out!

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|At first, I dreaded this album. I thought it would be just another Minutes to Midnight or A Thousand Suns, which were the two albums that drove me away from this band after being obsessed for years as a child. I grew up listening to this band, after Hybrid Theory came out when I was in grade school and my mother picked it up. I have to say I am impressed with this album. They have perfected their reinvention. The dubstep mixed in with the alternative worked well, and for once I look forward to this album being on the radio! I'm happy with how this turned out, and am looking forward to more of this!
B0010358CG|5.0|This is a great anime movie. I've been looking for this movie and it was good to find it. I received it in great condition. I also received it in a timely manner before it was do.
B000S88JTS|5.0|Was as good as I rememberd. Classic 70's footage brings back great memories of youth. A must have for motorcross fans or those feeling nostalgic fOr 70's .. Opening credits and seens are the best!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|This Die Hard is great. Finally they had one with the son in it. From the very first Die Hard you seen John Mclane had a son and daughter. Action packed but would of liked a little more hand to hand fight scenes but hey Bruce Willis is getting older now so the crazy stunts made up for it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I will try for a different take.<br /><br />This is a BBC documentary.  It is VERY helpful to see things from the point of view of others.<br /><br />The set covers the whole war but more than our history classes it focuses on:<br /><br />The land war<br />The early war<br />The war in Russia<br />The war from the British perspective<br /><br />Few folks in the U.S. who buy something like this need another America centered history.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|One of my favorite books of all time is A Thousand Splendid Sun's, I had high hopes for this one, but I am so disappointed! It shifts from time period and groups of people in such a way as it is difficult to follow, and then some of the story lines are never finished. I think Khaled is an amazing writer, but this one just didn't work for me.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|It all boils down to whether you like this move or not. I happen to LOVE it. I don't often buy movies when they come out; I just rent them when needed. But for the few movies I do love I always buy them right when they come out. Watched it last night in 2d and it was just as amazing as when we saw the movie in the theatre. I don't know why everyone's all up in arms about not getting a full 2d disc. The 3d players have the option to in regular non 3d mode. Also the digital copy is awesome to have for my iPad. Bottom line, I loved the movie, Love Amazon for delivering it super-fast, and Love Disney for a great Blu Ray Package.. !!
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|My 19 year old daughter liked it more than I did. Kind of hockie. More for the younger crowd I guess.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|one of the best movies of this and all times, it is difficult to make a superhero movie that has serious tone and not just romp and jokes. It shows the human side of Kar-El, in trying to be just one of us, but his fate will prepare something bigger \\"The ultimate hero of humanity\\".<br /><br />It shows a Clark who suffer the consequences of being different, their emotions, their feelings. Facing decisions between who he is or who he should be.<br /><br />The cast was amazing, everything fit to perfection: Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Antje Traue, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne ..<br /><br />The music is beautiful and powerful<br /><br />Indisputably 10/10 Movie
B002KLOPF8|5.0|This movie is two movies in one. The cartoonish version of Marine Corps boot camp in the first half, and the surrealistic depiction of Vietnam/Tet 68 in the second half. If you like the first half like I did, you will laugh your way through right up to the last day in boot camp, where the movie changes dramatically. Then you find its not a dark comedy anymore, its a horror-film.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Fantastic story of Scott Jurek's journey. This book made me love running even more. It even inspired me to go vegetarian- never thought that was possible!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie was too long and too convoluted. It may be a 'masterpiece' but its not very entertaining. I like history and politics but this one didnt bring me on board for the eventual satisfying conclusion.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|So much good stuff, so many life lessons. Such a satisfying ending. The heroes got their rewards, the villains got their proper punishments, and it ends on such a positive note. I watch this movie over and over and find something new each time. Better to watch the video version and not the TV version which cuts so much of the 'curse words' in the dialog.
1400095204|5.0|Excellent reading I enjoyed reading this book, wish the ending was a little different.  I am always interested in reading about lives of people from other countries and their struggles.  After listening to the Author's interview on radio I purchase two of her books this one and another. Of cause I read this one but must find the time in my busy schedule to read the second book, yes she is an excellent writer.

B002SRQ214|5.0|I received it and it meets my expectations.  It is very hard to find this item but it is good to know that you still carry it!!!!  It does help a great deal to know that even though your computer is old you can still find the parts that are required to keep it working.  Thank you AMAZON for thinking of the public and their needs!!!!  Your service is great as well and I am very pleased with the Customer Service that you provide to your clients.  Hoping that you still carry those parts that are so hard to find in other sites.  There are many people that can not afford to purchase new computers and they have to work with what they have and when you can't find anything is very discouraging.  You are indeed a great asset to your Customers.  Thank you so very much!!!!!!

B0091REZMW|4.0|A really fun game, one of the better hidden object puzzles out there. The fact that it is free just makes it all the more great
B00942Y6WI|4.0|Everyone always says the movie isn't as good as the book and this definitely stands for this movie.  Since the movie is already 2 1/2 hours, I understand nothing more could be added from the book.  I think they chose the right parts to add to the movie and most were done well.  There were some random parts changed from the book that I really can't understand why they changed them.  I don't see how they benefited the movie.<br /><br />Other then the difference between the book and movie the ending of the story was just ok.  I feel like they could have left you on a higher note about society changing or something, but it just kind of...ends.<br /><br />I still recommend watching the movie and DEFINITELY read the book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It can be hard but very fun and challenging! I enjoy the difficulty level and love that we work together as a family to solve the problems.

1608955702|5.0|I have all three of Neil's books and this one has helped me the most. Learning how to achieve great results with on and off camera flash were very helpful in the first two books but learning how to see the light and the quality of the light takes you to the heart of what photography is all about.<br /><br />The examples and images and lighting set ups are excellent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The premise itself is  disturbing.  The author presents the case in a very interesting way and keeps you thinking as<br />you continue reading.  The idea stays in your mind as you process all the information.
0307959856|4.0|Death comes to Pemberley was well written and easy to read, and the author is to be congratulated for not twisting the peronalities of our Pride and Prejudice favourites. However, the plot was to me a little unbelievable. I enjoyed the read, although I thought the story not quite up to her usual 'whodunit' treasures which are hard to put down.
B002PD39HQ|5.0|I had wanted to add some Kraftwerk to my regular listening. I listened to samples from many of their albums, and I thought this would be a great first one to try. I was not disappointed. This collection is very ethereal and easy to listen to in all scenarios.
B00006JKLI|5.0|This is such an under-appreciated group! The DVD-A is incredible. I bought a (used) car that has this system and it is a definite improvement over CD's, though not so much if you aren't too into the nuances of recorded sound.
B00ARX2W24|5.0|You probably will know Route 101 and Fandano. The rest of album is also very good. Think of it as the TJB with influences from Rise. The trumpet sound is in the style of the TJB with the double tracking, but the production is more modern. I prefer Fandango to RIse since it is uniformly strong, while side 2 of Rise is a bit weak.
1452115567|5.0|It`s awesome. Full stop. Maddie on Things obviously has great subject matter. This coonhound is amazing in so many ways and she`s sure to put a smile on the face of even the most surliest person. What sticks out in my mind, however, is that the introduction is one of the best intros I have ever read. Theron`s story is just so...real.  His voice is so honest and kind. The way he communicates just has a presence that`s incredibly refreshing.  Having now met both Theron and Maddie at a book signing, these impressions that I had seem to be bang on.  Theron speaks from the heart, he has this ability to get you fired up and enthusiastic. He loves what he`s doing and that permeates the space around him. His work done with best friend is perfect but his non-Maddie photography is definitely worth a perusal. I`m being repetitive, but it`s just so real and honest.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|To me this sounds like the culmination of a couple of decades of musical mastery, innovation and experience, and it combines the best elements of their previous two albums into a sophisticated and coherent concept.<br /><br />Do not listen to all the negative reviews - this is as experimental as any mars volta, and yet it manages to produce brilliantly catchy songs in the best traditions of King Crimson and even Pink Floyd. (Moreover, I hear definite elements of Peter Gabriel's early solo albums and even The Clash!)<br /><br />Mars Volta manage to distill into a stellar work of art decades of the most innovative and powerful traditions in rock music. If you are here to get more of the Mars Volta, you'll enjoy this.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book focuses on (what to me are) the secondary characters of the series.  After wondering for 800+ pages why there's no mention of so many significant characters, not the least of whom being Tyrion, you finally see on the last page of the book and explanation from the author that the book was going to be so long that he had to split it into two volumes and, instead of taking the usual chronological division approach, he took the one of separating the characters into two batches and taking each through the entire time range in independent books.<br /><br />Even so, compared to the third novel, not a lot happens to anyone here and it was a bit of a let down as a result.  I am looking forward to volume five and the continuing sage of John Snow, Tyrion and the dragron Queen/Princess.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Note: This is an in-depth and lengthy review, so if you don't have the patience for that, please move along. This isn't for you.<br /><br />As true with most bands attempting to put out new material after a lengthy absence, the 3/4 members of Black Sabbath are in an unenviable and inescapable position of having to please an audience made up of very different kinds of fans decades after the height of their popularity. So, 13 was going to be polarizing no matter what. It's 35 years since their last album together. Ozzy isn't going to sound like he did in the '70s (or even '90s), and that reality is going to affect listeners for whom that voice was such a draw on those albums. By the same token, Iommi and Butler aren't the same people or musicians either.<br /><br />To make matter more difficult for them, they chose to move forward without Bill Ward, who the hardcore fan knows was much more than just a drummer. In many ways, Ward was the band's heart, and had a defining influence on their sound. That means that right off the bat, a significant portion of people are going to dismiss this album because of their anger and dissapointment that he was left off it.<br /><br />Additionally, the remaining members' choice to produce with Rick Rubin, who all but destroyed his reputation by over-compressing Metallica's Death Magnetic, was going to turn off another significant faction of the fan-base.<br /><br />On the other side of the divide, there's going to be a large vocal faction who, like a large segment of the Star Wars fanbase, will praise this album regardless of how it turned out just because they're uncritically devoted to Tony, Ozzy and Geezer.<br /><br />As if music wasn't challenging enough to review (due to the fact that it IS so subjective), these factors play a large role in the reviews we're seeing here and elsewhere. And yet, they are legitimate (if divisive) topics of debate.<br /><br />It's helpful for the reader to know a little about the reviewer going in, so in brief, I'm a Black Sabbath fan from the age of 11, and would definitely be considered a hardcore fan in that they're: a) my favorite band, b) I own and actively listen to every album, c) I've read every book on the band and \\"keep up\\" with the individual members. That said, I'm more of a purist in that, while I own the later albums with Dio, Gillen, Hughes, etc., I consider those the work of other bands (e.g., Heaven and Hell for the Dio era, etc.) and not Black Sabbath. So, if you're still with me after that statement, you know that I'm not a casual fan (who really only knows Paranoid and maybe the S/T album or Master of Reality). I love all EIGHT albums, and my favorites tend to change, but they include Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Never Say Die, as I do NOT subscribe to the idea that Sabbath lost anything after Sabotage. So, yes, I love the fact that they were a heavy, progressive band, not a band that was content to rest on their laurels and repeat themselves.<br /><br />These statements will color my feelings on this album.<br /><br />I do miss Ward on 13. Wilk is a fantastic drummer, and I'm glad it was him and not a traditional \\"metal\\" drummer. Wilk is great, but he isn't as adventurous, jazzy  or idiosyncratic as Ward. But of course he isn't. He's not Bill Ward. And it doesn't help that he's so far back in the mix. But more on the production later. So, yes, a point is taken away due to the fact Iommi/Osbourne/Butler didn't ensure Ward was on here. Forget the tour -- On tour, they could've had two drummers (like the Moody Blues and other bands do) or even a replacement one, if, in fact, Ward can't handle the rigors of the road. But an album is forever, and this was billed as a reunion of the original lineup, so it should be Bill on here, and no one else.<br /><br />With that out of the way, how is the material?<br /><br />IMO, it's excellent to just ok. Iommi, Osbourne and Butler haven't been idle these last 35 years. They've been making music, much of which sounds nothing like '70s-era Black Sabbath. So, attempting to come in after three-plus decades and analyze and understand what it was that made them write and play the way they did is going to be challenging. As a result, you're going to hear modern-era Ozzy and modern-era Iommi on 13. \\"Methademic\\" sounds like something that would've been written for the Heaven and Hell band (or GZR for that matter). \\"Naivete in Black\\" (the Best-Buy exclusive) and \\"Pariah\\" sound like modern-era Ozzy songs. \\"God is Dead?\\" and \\"Dear Father\\" sounds like a combination of the two with the additional attempt to sound like early Sabbath.<br /><br />That latter point has the subject of much praise and lambastment. Songs like \\"End of the Beginning\\" and \\"Zeitgeist\\" sound like old-Sabbath, but too much for some who feel it's a contrived attempt to placate a fanbase, rather than an organic approach to songwriting (in other words, you can't BE Black Sabbath if you're trying to sound like Black Sabbath). In the end, only you, the listener, can determine whether this is a continuation from before, or a plagiarization of it.<br /><br />For ME, I admit that I want what's almost impossible. I want Sabbath to sound like '69-'79 era Sabbath without sounding like they're cribbing from old songs. And you know what? \\"Damaged Soul\\" achieves that near-impossible task! It doesn't remind me of a prior song, but it feels and sounds like something that was left off one of the original albums. If only the rest of the album could've achieved that, but it does come close at times. When it doesn't, it falls flat. \\"End of the Beginning\\" and \\"God is Dead?\\" are just too slow. Sabbath had the reputation of playing slow (given them by the critics), but actually listen to anything past the song \\"Black Sabbath.\\" Even \\"Under the Sun\\" which starts off with a slow, doomy riff, moves into high-gear very quickly. So does \\"Cornucopia,\\" and \\"Into the Void\\" and any other song that seems to be slow, but actually isn't. On 13, however, Rubin seems to go with the critical thinking rather than the reality, and moves the band into glacial territory. This is to the song's detriment. Thankfully, each song changes gear, but far too late. \\"God is Dead?\\" is one stanza too long in the beginning, and it doesn't help that it's a reworking of \\"Black Sabbath.\\" Same with \\"End of the Beginning.\\" Maybe some will like Ozzy singing like grandpa, but I don't find that it works or feels natural and organic. It feels contrived, and I'm tempted to Goldwave the album on a higher speed.<br /><br />When the album does come close to realizing that elusive IT, as the aforementioned \\"Damaged Soul\\" does, it's a thing of beauty, as songs like \\"Loner,\\" \\"Age of Reason\\" and \\"Peace of Mind\\" attest to. Even \\"Life Forever\\" sounds like it could've been left off Vol. 4 (I mean that in the best way). So, we're looking at least 5 out of the 12 songs that have that classic sound to them. WITH one caveat. Don't expect Ozzy to have THAT voice. I actually miss that voice even more than I do Bill Ward. \\"Loner\\" (which bears no small resemblance to \\"Voodoo\\") would've sounded amazing in 1981 (in the alternate world where Ozzy worked out his differences and drug problems and stayed with Sabbath for another few albums). But a big problem is that Ozzy's voice is placed very up-front in the mix. Go back and listen to the first eight albums. Very rarely was that the case (he's up-front on \\"Changes,\\" the exception to the rule). Now that his range and register are diminished, why on earth did Rubin decide to place Ozzy's voice so up-front??<br /><br />Getting back to the songs, even if \\"End of the Beginning\\" and \\"Zeitgeist\\" strike a little too close to earlier material, they're still good songs. In fact, the latter can be considered excellent, though personally I'd have replaced the bongos with something else (thereby eliminating the comparisons to \\"Planet Caravan, and, again, Ozzy's voice is way to forward in the mix). In the end, these songsare the reason I gave the album a four-out-of-five star review. So that brings us to at least 6 out of the 12 songs that are pretty good, and if you have a taste for more modern sounding songs (or \\"God is Dead?\\" which I have ambivalent feelings towards), that number will go up. For me, I love \\"Peace of Mind\\" and would've put it on the album proper, and while not my favorite song, I like the tempo changes in \\"Dear Father\\" so that brings me to enjoying 8 out of 12 songs (which isn't bad.)<br /><br />On the down side, everyone whose angrily complained about the compression is right, and they have every reason to be annoyed. The album is brickwalled, over-compressed and clipped. No, it's not as bad as Death Magnetic, but it's still bad enough that it destroys the dynamic range and breath that these songs need in order to sound truly live and heavy (like the original albums did, which is what Rubin says he was going after). Instead, the production gives the listener ear-fatigue (which no Sabbath album ever had, unless it was remastered that way in the modern day). Do the comparisons yourself. Pop in Sabotage and listen to how those songs live and breathe. Music is meant to have quiet, moderate and loud sections. This fake-loudness that became the trend with hip-hop and MP3s destroys that by mixing the album so that, essentially, all the dials have been turned to 10. Bands like Sabbath are particularly harmed by this because their sound is defined by a kind of musical chiaroscuro effect, light and darkness, soft and heavy, and many of the shades and shadows in between. Think of \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" and the way that song alternates back and forth. That kind of sound is ruined by the production of 13. The vinyl is a little better, but only by a margin.<br /><br />The sequencing (the order of songs) doesn't help either. \\"End of the Beginning\\" and \\"God is Dead\\" back-to-back is just bad sequencing, as both songs follow a similar structure and are overly long. Yes, Black Sabbath is known for their long, twisty songs with lots of tempo changes, but they were always varied and didn't FEEL long. These two song have their energy sucked dry. A more astute producer (and that's not a knock to Rubin, but an honest assessment) would've left in Iommi's original (and lengthier) solo in \\"God is Dead?\\" and edited one of the early stanzas instead.<br /><br />Additionally, Iommi/Osbourne/Butler didn't need to crib \\"Black Sabbath's\\" tritone again and again. I understand why they went there. It's what the casual fan expects, and what many who only listen to heavy metal and doom metal want. But it's ultimately un-Sabbathy. Some might recall that Iommi himself stated that \\"not staying in one bag\\" and \\"trying new things\\" was what they were all about, and that's evidenced by their progression from Black Sabbath to Never Say Die. Sadly, many fans (though not all) weren't as open to new ideas and experimentation, as revealed by the unjustly negative reviews afforded Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die. Since nobody wants to get bad reviews or look bad in the press, Iommi couldn't exactly continue where he left off in the Ozzy-era. Nor could he really, even if he wanted to. He's been playing in a very different style since the '70s.<br /><br />Yet, rightly, few want a Black Sabbath that sounds \\"modern,\\" as evidenced by the general disdain for \\"Psycho Man\\" and \\"Selling My Soul.\\" It's NOT easy to be Black Sabbath, not even for the original members of Black Sabbath. There was a genuine magic back then, an organic driving force. There was a \\"fifth member,\\" as Iommi and Ward often contend. Of course, one has to wonder if there can be fifth member if the fourth is missing?<br /><br />My criticisms aside, I am glad this album exists, but I do feel it could've been better. The production, for one, shouldn't have rendered it so sterile, clinical, cold and compressed. Black Sabbath had some great producers over the years, Rodger Bain, Mike Butcher, even Iommi himself.Rubin's not one of them.  Now credit where it's due: Rubin gave the band direction; it's good that he understands that Sabbath were proto-metal, and a lot jazzier, bluesier and jammier than any heavy band that followed in their wake, and to that end, Rubin deserves praise (though why the band themselves didn't understand that, I don't know; perhaps they did, but the story sounds better that Rubin \\"returned them to their original sound\\"). But why not go the full length then, and retain the natural dynamic range of these songs? Why not have the album sound like the early ones? And why even include songs like \\"Methademic\\" which if we're being honest here, doesn't at all sound like Ozzy-era Sabbath? (I know some people love it, but what I'm saying is based on Rubin's stated goal of doing an album that could sit next to the first few).<br /><br />Of the lyrics, which is something few reviewers ever touch on, they're brilliant as only Geezer Butler can write, but a few seem a bit rushed. \\"Age of Reason\\" is a classic song of social criticism, and in its indictment of the military-industrial complex, organized religion and the masses' tendency towards self-medication and consumerism, it's directly in line with the socially-critical \\"Cornucopia,\\" \\"Killing Yourself to Live,\\" \\"Under the Sun,\\" \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Wicked World.\\" Osbourne's contributions aren't bad either (Ozzy wrote four lyrics), but are marred by a few clunkers, e.g., \\"I may be dreaming, but whatever\\" (really, Ozzy, \\"whatever\\"?) and \\"Pariah,\\" which really belongs to Ozzy's solo material than Sabbath). Butler tends more towards the existentialism of Vol. 4 this time round, so it's a bit of a downer and not as openly sagelike as Paranoid, Master of Reality and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath are, which may account for the absence of the traditional admonitory tone of Black Sabbath (some of it is there in \\"End of the Beginning,\\" \\"Age of Reason\\" and even \\"Naivete in Black,\\" though that expresses an awkward ambivalence towards the idea of giving direction.) There's also a dearth of the kind of storytelling we see on the debut album or NSD. Overall, it's great to hear Butler's voice again, but on the next album, a little more of Sabbath's strength and spirituality and little less despondency would be great!<br /><br />In the final analysis, get the album, decide for yourself. To me, the original eight albums are perfect. This one could never have lived up to those, but it's still great. Few bands can truly write and execute material that stands alongside the music they made during their creative peak years. So, if you're like me in that regard, and can come to terms with the points I mentioned above, you'll probably enjoy it. Some love this album and find it better than the original eight. That baffles me, but to each his own. For me, I'll re-sequence the songs a bit, place \\"Age of Reason\\" as the album-closer and the excellent \\"Loner\\" as the second song (of either the first or second \\"side\\"), and look for a way to edit the sound so that it's not so damned fatiguing on the ears.<br /><br />Hopefully, on the next album, Iommi/Osbourne and Butler will:<br /><br />a) Get Ward back.<br />b) Find a producer who understands the 70s-era Black Sabbath aesthetics AND the natural dynamics of music (Martin Birch, Tom Allom, Mike Butcher), and that means no compression and putting Ozzy's voice further back in the mix.<br />c) Be more musically adventurous as they once were, and include more instrumentals, variety, and esoteric kinds of piece (e.g., \\"Solitude,\\" \\"Fluff,\\" \\"Spiral Architect,\\" \\"Supertzar,\\" \\"Air Dance,\\" \\"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\\"), which is going to mean eschewing the idea of appealing to a target audience in favor of being creative and unafraid to experiment, realizing that only they can capture the unique essence of Black Sabbath (as they did on \\"Damaged Soul\\") without needing to borrow the very melodies of early Sabbath.<br /><br />This is a band for whom anything is possible!are the reason I gave the album a four-out-of-five star review.

Last time i checked he cannot run ultramarathon, nor deadlift 500 lbs (unless using a machine that guides the weights in a 2d plane which is much easier). Tim Ferriss credibility took a major hit for me and i regret buying the book.

B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Don't know why I am surprised, but thinking that movie stars would be able to sing like Broadway stars is wishful thinking.<br />The only thing good about this movie remake is the scenery.  A bit easier to recreate the images of the time period than on a stage.<br />But it all goes back to the disappointing job the leads do in trying to be singers.  It just doesn't work
B00CKZX0AA|2.0|I had hoped for a fresh take on the Superman saga, but none was to be found.  Zimmer's soundtrack is more at home behind a noisy first-person shooter video game for adolescents.  Punishing use of percussion, meandering, incoherent themes, and dire lack of heart haunt this soundtrack.  You won't catch yourself humming any of this when you need that extra ounce of heroism to get you through the day.  A musical score painted with a sledgehammer as only Zimmer can deliver. Ultimately forgettable.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I haven't written many reviews.  In general I feel most reviews have said what needs to be said already.<br />I picked up this book expecting to have a good hate read, to roll my eyes at the navel gazing, the probable Bella clone, the ridiculously ideal and unrealistic male lead that loves an average girl for no reason and says things like \\"it's always been you, it'll always be you\\", cue intense, smoldering stare.  BARF.<br /><br />But, smack me upside the back of the head with a salami, this book floored me.<br />It actually made me cry.  I felt like I was reading my story.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone but what happened to me and a friend happened to Sky and Les, and the result was the same.  Only I am still here, she's gone.  So I can tell you, Colleen Hoover may have painted it in the surreal colors of escapist romantic fantasy, but she still painted a realistic portrait of certain kinds of suffering and their after effects.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting it to get so deep.  It started off with the same things I was dreading, girl who talks about her appearance a lot, mysterious hottie bad boy, but then it started to weave around me, drawing me in with an uneasy sense that this was going to wind up more intense than I had planned on.<br /><br />I realized the key to what makes New Adult really work, when it really works, which this does.  It's because within the ideal, unrealistic relationships with hot guys who suddenly want you so badly, is often hidden serious subjects that other books ignore.  The fluff between helps get the reader through the tough parts, and makes the love more satisfying.<br /><br />It's so confusing.  One minute hot guys, one minute redemption.  One minute dry humping, one minute forgiveness for those who have hurt you.  One minute smoldering gazes, one minute torturous reminders of the ways we can lose those we have loved.  The way I lost someone I loved.<br /><br />But it really works.  I'll treasure this as a lesson in judging any genre of books.  This one is close to my heart, and while I won't read it again for a good long time, it was exactly what I needed to read.<br /><br />In summation, well written, interesting, steamy at times, and heartbreaking at others.<br /><br />But really, describing accurately my feelings while reading this book, that would be Hopeless.

B00023B1A8|5.0|While this concert was made in the 90's, it will still make your heart thump to see these guys resurrect their heyday.  It was apparent that they had not sung together in a while and after every perfectly harmonized song, they broke out in delighted grins and high-fived each other because they knew how awesome it sounded...and awesome it is.<br /><br />This concert was all accoustic. All three played guitars like they were an extension of the instrument, and Stephen Stills was just PHENOMENAL as he tore up the electric one and brought back that searing cry that we kids of the 60's grew to love so much. Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Wooden Ships will make you want to cry from the beauty of the voices and the guitars.  Seriously I can't recommend this dvd enough.  It will bring back your youth or show a younger person what life was like in the hippie days.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|I had never heard of The Weeknd until I did read an article on internet praising it. So I thought let's try and see how much I like him....<br />I still have hard time defining the genre for his music and I would say it is a compliment.<br />If you like Bass, strong bass, deep bass... coupled with Electronic music and a voice reminiscent of Michael Jackson (listen to his version of Dirty Diana), you will likely love him.<br />I first listened to his album \\"House of ballons\\" and then I searched for more. The Album \\"Trilogy\\" is what I was looking for. In clear, 3 albums in one. I chose the CD version over downloading because of the better recording quality. Why getting an inferior version when you could rip the songs afterwards at 320Kbps or evern lossless (Iphones do not support F.L.A.C).<br /><br />Do not buy it if you do not like hearing curse words or talks about sex...<br /><br />Otherwise, buy it and you won't regret it.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson is arguably a modern genius of the prog community along with Mikael Akerfeldt, yet when they both came together for the Storm Corrosion project it had little impact on me. Wilson however as a solo artist has become intensely passionate about his music, and his solo albums are incredible masterpieces, especially 'Grace For Drowning' that floored me to the point where I had to obtain the deluxe version. Having to follow up such a brilliant album is not an easy thing but somehow Wilson has done so with a flourish that has heralded in the 2013 year in admirable style. Alan Parsons was on board to engineer this album so one would have to expect a high quality sound and it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The album cover is like a rash all over the net with the astonished moon looming full and iconic in the darkness. The artwork is simple but embeds itself into the conscious easily and thus does its job to gain attention. The rest of the artwork in the Deluxe Version booklet consists of line drawings, some colourful paintings of the dishevelled looking kid in dense locations, a miserable man looking into a beer glass, later drinking a shot, some disturbing scratchy drawings, darkened stairwells and window frames, creepy faces staring out, images of a house, a tree and the scrawny watchmaker at work as his wife looks on, frames from the 'Raven' video clip with snow falling down in the forest, and the shivering old man pursuing the elusive bird. The booklet is extensive and arty as one might expect, and ends with an amusing drawing of the band playing looking like thin men with Wilson headbanging away. The artwork on the CD is the Raven looking mystical and enigmatic, and of course if you did get the Deluxe package you also have a 7 song demo to indulge in and the album in 5.1 sound on a blu ray and a DVD thrown in with all the clips and interviews.<br /><br />'The Raven That Refused To Sing' has been promoted with film clips hovering about on the internet way before its release date and the film clip images that accompanies the title track are extraordinary. Wilson has reinvented himself again on this album, discarding the darkness of 'Grace For Drowning', and embracing a sound more akin to Porcupine Tree, oddly enough. The title track is masterful, and as it was the first track I heard initially I will start here. It is laced with beautiful keyboards and a pretty melody masking the downbeat lyrics that focus on the man's dead sister, that haunts the storyteller like the raven, and he misses her terribly and dreams of her to return to him; 'Just because I'm weak, You can steal my dreams, You can reach inside my head, And you can put your song there instead.'<br /><br />Lyrically the poetry in the song has a melancholy edge. The images on the clip of an old man in a forest encountering a raven and then pursuing it finally capturing it and then dying, have a profound symbolic resonance. According to Wilson, the songs have classic Gothic ideas interspersed with suggested dread, regret, loss and the fear of mortality, or impending death, thus the omen of the Raven. It is these ideas that create a very unique atmosphere on the album. The raven essentially becomes, in the mind of the old man, a reincarnation of the old man's dead sister, and in his own delusion he believes if he can capture the raven and hear him sing he can recapture the life of his dead sister. The music is stripped back at times to a piano reverberating in the stillness. Wilson knows how to build on musical ideas and surpasses himself with such tracks, the mesmirising and haunting beauty is superb.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Luminol' with a delightful pulsating bassline and reverb wah wah guitar splashes. Musically the album is faultless and the flute enhances the quality. There are some wonderful Yes-like multilayered harmonies for a moment and then the extended musical break dominates, with an odd time sig, an intense spectrum of bass, pounding percussion, floating flute, and Mellotron sounds. The electric piano runs have a 70s vibe especially when it builds with a shimmering soundscape, and utilising distortion devices and a ring modulator to good effect. At 4:35 it settles into a minimalist rhythm guitar and Wilson's vocals, in his reflective mood, with references to pop culture, 'the songs he learned from scratched LPs, stops in mid flow to sip his tea.' The lyrics centre on a protagonist who has died even in death continues to discover answers through reminiscing on the past or reflecting on a life that has faded; 'He strums the chords with less than grace, Each passing year etched on his face', is a reflection on how one might feel as we are 'born into a struggle, To come so far but end up returning to dust.' This ghost is a metaphor of fear and our obsession with mortality, according to Wilson in his online interviews.<br /><br />Wilson doesn't labour on grim themes or death however throughout, and this album has more rays of hope than the shadows of despair found on previous releases, and leaves one with a profound sense of fulfilment. The music is uplifting and energetic, infused with passion throughout and progressive ideas using all the musicians at Wilson's disposal. The flute playing of Theo Travis is exquisite, but I am a real fan of that grinding organ by Adam Holzman, and the way the guitar interplays creating those endearing melodies. 'Luminol' is a masterpiece of the album and a promise of things to come.<br /><br />Next is 'Drive Home' that opens with a sweet Neo-Classical melody that sounds partially like 'Castle In The Clouds' from 'Les Mesirables'. When Wilson comes in on vocals, the signature locks into a steady measured pace. All is held back like the old days of Porcupine Tree or the 'Deadwing' era. There is a remarkable beauty that emanates from the Mellotrons that sound like violins. The chorus is Wilson at his most melancholy with thought provoking lyrics; 'You need to clear away all the jetsam in your brain, And face the truth, Well love can make amends, While the darkness always ends, You're still alone so drive home.' The instrumental break is stripped back to a nice fingerpicking guitar motif, like Steve Howe, and Travis's achingly beautiful flute is layered over. The lead guitar break of Guthrie Govan that follows is incredible, soaring emotionally and adds so much depth to the overall atmosphere.<br /><br />'The Holy Drinker' is a glorious throwback to the eclectic prog of vintage King Crimson meets Van der Graaf Generator, with elements of jazz fusion and mind blowing dissonant saxophone blasts. It opens with the wavering keyboard sound heard on Van der Graaf Generator's 'A Plague Of Lighthouse Keepers', then breaks into a cacophony of sound like a jazz shop exploded. Theo Travis is master at the sax helm and Wilson is the commander as he constructs this disharmony of musical instruments. I adored this on first listen and it soon became the quintessential track of the album for me. After this outlandish intro, the song finds some semblance of structure and Wilson sings some odd lyrics that I don't want to think about too deeply; 'With shaking hands and blackened heart, The glass he pours, this time it's also the last, In rapt communion with himself, The Holy Drinker is going straight in to hell.' On cue the song breaks into extended soloing with some wonderful organ and chirping flute taking centre stage. I love how the organ has that Keith Emerson 'Tarkus' sound at 6:25, but a special mention goes to the sporadic drumming of Marco Minnemann and Bass of Nick Beggs that are always on target and played to perfection. The song settles into Wilson's echoing gentle voice at about 8 minutes in, but it feels ominous as though the jazz fusion will break out at any moment. Then a grinding Van der Graaf Generator organ sound growls viciously with a downbeat tone, joined by odd rhythmic guitars. This feels like the coda of VDGG's 'White Hammer' andit is ferociously off kilter enough to jar the senses to their most awakened state. AlI in all a furious blast of masterful music and one to seek out for those interested in checking out the best on the album.<br /><br />Thus far the album is astonishing, nothing less than brilliant prog, so I was looking forward to the next half. 'The Pin Drop' is the shortest song at 5.03, and has Wilson on his highest register tone singing; 'Carried away by the river that passes through bulrushes on to the sea, Dragged by the current to rest on the stakes of the breakwater shaded by trees, Beginnings and endings, love intersecting a rift that will break us apart.' The return of the sax is so welcome, and Travis lifts off with massive runs and haunting squeals of jazz ecstasy. The song moves into a Twilight Zone like atmosphere melodically, and feels again like vintage Porcupine Tree. The layered harmonies are exceptional and create a wall of sound, and all is augmented by the accomplished lead guitar solo of Govan. All this in 5 minutes, simply incredible work from Mr Wilson.<br /><br />'The Watchmaker' is another of the album's epics, and showcases Wilson's poetry in the lyrics; 'The watchmaker buries something deep within his thoughts, A shadow on the staircase of someone from before, This thing is broken now and cannot be repaired, Fifty years of compromise and aging bodies shared, Eliza dear, you know there's something I should say, I never really loved you but I'll miss you anyway.' The music is appropriately like a music box chiming, very Gabriel-era Genesis in fact, and is enhanced by dreamy flute embellishments. There is a glorious lead guitar solo, perhaps the best on the album with Govan taking on speedy licks effortlessly and the squeaky sax joins in and it suddenly reminds me of Pink Floyd. The song takes on a new format then with piano runs and Wilson's voice emanating thoughts of the Watchmaker who reminisces on a dark deed involving the murder of his wife who has returned from the grave; 'But for you I had to wait, Until one day it was too late.' The music and harmonies become more romantically intertwined utilising old school 'do do do's' and then finally it breaks out into an odd time sig and some glistening piano sparkles, a booming bass solo reminding me of Rush's Geddy Lee. Finally the next phase of the music becomes dissonant with weird off tones in a 7/8 meter, being used where they should not, creating a disquieteing effect. This is a complex piece of music and perhaps the darkest track on the whole album, more like the 'Grace For Drowning' themes than others on offer.<br /><br />It ends of course with the beauty of 'The Raven That Refused To Sing' and we are left with an astonishing album of dark haunting power as only Wilson knows how to create. This is certainly a different creature than 'Grace For Drowning' and did not impact me like that masterpiece, and yet this latest release is mesmerising on every listen. It is an album to listen to with unwavering focus, as is all of Wilson's work; music designed for headphones. It is hard to rate this album as everything is so well placed and perfect; Wilson throws in so many ideas that it is impossible not to enjoy this if your ears are attuned to experimental progressive ideas. It did not measure up to 'Grace For Drowning' for me, but still is a masterful album presented in a compact form of less than an hour. If you want more, the Deluxe version is ample enough though did not add that much musically, but more artistically. The experience is sheer joy when an album comes out that embraces all that is great about prog. The sax, the organ, the lead guitars, the rhythms; all are played to perfection. Wilson's voice is faultless and his ideas are poetically conveyed to precision.<br /><br />Perhaps it is too perfect and too calculating for some listeners and I can understand how this can be off putting, and why it has received mixed critical reactions. However, Wilson is nothing short of passionate about his music and every note is placed to generate a congenial effect to enhance the overall experience. This is a series of stories, as the album titles states, and each story has its own atmosphere and style though there is a consistency in the thematic juxtaposition of music and vocals. It is a far superior album to some of the earlier Porcupine Tree albums and indeed Wilson's debut solo. I would rank it easily among his greatest triumphs, and certainly it is going to be one of the albums of the year. An album this bold and inventive deserves full recommendation and thus far it is the best release in 2013, so 5 shining stars to a modern musical genius that continues to produce prog at its highest caliber.it is ferociously off kilter enough to jar the senses to their most awakened state.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I love this movie. It keeps you interested from the very start to the very end. Even my 9 year old nephew loved this movie, of course I waited until the actual games started before calling him in to watch it with me. Thank you for this great movie and can't wait for the sequel.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Riverside are one of the most exciting dynamic prog artists to come out over recent years. On this latest release 'Shrine of New Generation Slaves' (abbreviated as SONGS! Don't you love it?) Mariusz Duda is as masterful as ever on crystal clear vocals, and pulsating bass. He is joined by the incredible guitars of Piotr Grudzinski, the keyboard finesse of Michal Lapaj, and the piledriver drums of Piotr Kozieradzki. When I first listened to this album I was not really worried about whether the band would sound like previous albums as I have found that their albums differ greatly from one another over the years, and they are still able to maintain interest simply due to the virtuoso musicianship and innovative compositions. So I ventured into this without any prior knowledge of what to expect, conceptually or otherwise, and had not looked at a single review, and forgot the clip available of 'Celebrity Touch'. This was a good move because the album absolutely transfixed me from beginning to end, without prior expectation. It is an incredible album, and one of the best so far in the early stages of 2013; one of the top ten masterpieces of 2013. I am delighted that this is the case as I have really grown to love this band over the years and they never disappoint which is a rare thing these days.<br /><br />'New Generation Slave' (4:18) opens with distorted vocals and a powerful prog riff crashing through. It builds to a fast fractured rhythm reminding me of Soundgarden's 'Spoon Man', or indeed the riff on 'The Same River' from Riverside's 'Out of Myself' debut. The heaviness is densely layered with Lapaj's shimmering Hammond. There is a fiery guitar and bass tempo and it is all refined by the glaze of Duda's pristine vocals; a towering start to the album and an absolute sure fire killer intro to the band for those who had not heard previous songs. The lyrics focus on the hate of the new generation, the lost hopes and broken dreams that pervade this dark world; 'Into this world I came, Filled with fear, Crying all the time, I guess my birth, Left a great scar on my heart and mind, Now I hand-pick cotton, And struggle to sing \\"I am happy and I do what I like\\", But my voice breaks and I start to hate my singing and simply everyone.'<br /><br />'The Depth Of Self ' Delusion' (7:40) has the acoustic vibrations of Grudzinski's guitar, and Duda's melancholy vocals are executed with passion. The lead break and driving tempo is built gradually over an uplifting melody. It is bookended with more finger picking acoustics capping off a beautiful song with a compelling structure. The lyrics by Duda are all about feeling like a wall is being built up, similar to Pink Floyd's hypothesis, and it really touches a chord with me; 'I could be foreign forevermore to your neverland, One little brick then another and I will build that wall anyway, You can find me there rested and calm without mask, This is where I will stay.'<br /><br />'Celebrity Touch' (6:48) opens with killer driller riffs that have an intricate time sig. Duda's vocals are crystal clear and work well with the electrifying keyboard and guitar driven punctuation. It is a heavy song with some magnificent syncopated rhythms. There are some higher vocals in the background too that augment the tranquil atmospheres generated in the quieter verses. It has an infectious melody in the chorus and moves along at an energetic pace. This is a very nice composition with layers of musicianship of the highest quality. It really grew on me with that bassline and crunching guitar riff. I love Duda's lyrics on the dangers and hypocrisy of celebrity status, the lies and fabrication of maintaining a false fa'ade that will please the masses but in in the end is an empty existence; 'In the center of attention, TV, Glossy magazines, My private life is public, I sell everything, Days are getting shorter, They'll forget about me soon, So I jump on the bandwagon, With no taboos.' This sentiment could represent any celebrity who is trapped by public attention, something that is craved but when it is gained the celebrity abhors being the subject of hysteria as their life becomes a tomb, their home a prison, it is a sobering thought. It is little wonder celebrities become cynical and crazy, jumping on a bandwagon with no taboos, as sometimes they are given little choice as products of consumer hell.<br /><br />'We Got Used To Us' (4:12) is a song that has a measured tempo and some effective lead guitar motifs over layered harmonised vocals. The timbre of Duda's voice is always a drawcard for me, he is able to create the most powerful sensuous moods as he pours out the reflective lyrics. Once again Grudzinski's lead guitar break is present but this one is more subtle with Lapaj's moody piano augmentations. This sombre song sent chills through me, it is simple compared to other tracks on the album but it has such a haunting melody and some very potent lyrics that strike to the heart; 'I know we got used to new life, And I don't want to be there, No, I don't want to be there, Where we are, Silence fallen between, All the doors are locked, All the words unsaid, And we're still afraid of time, Started to keep ourselves, At a distance that we could control, Not too close, Not too far.' The protagonist is trying to come to terms wth the loss of his loved one, perhaps a good break up song as it captures the turmoil of emotions felt, the emptiness that drives nails into the heart, love being replaced by bitterness and the cold feeling that it is over. It ends with the pleading phrase echoing, 'so walk away with me'.<br /><br />'Feel Like Falling' (5:19) is a real surprise eclectic package beginning with 80s retro synths buzzing, reminding me of the rhythm of 'Candy Man' by Suzi Quatro, one of my favourites. It is enhanced by 1968 style Hammond pads from Lapaj. The rhythm is quirky and similar to the style of Muse and high register vocals again backing to add a further dimension of harmony. A heavy guitar riff comes in with a half time feel, and some glorious effervescent Hammond quavers. It closes with an instrumental break with Grudzinski's muscular guitars in an odd time sig and some wah-wah pedal lead embellishments. This is one of the highlight tracks undoubtedly. The time sig is complex at times and I wished it would have gone on longer as it is one of Riverside's best compositions. The lyrics focus on the protagonist bouncing back after the loss felt from the broken relationships, expressed in metaphors; 'Could have been a tree of dawn, Rooted deeply in the ground, Bearing fruits, Far away from falling into blank space.' The blank space is that nothing box that has been opened when one's world has turned to despair and life is like a blank slate with nothing written on it. It is like starting over from scratch now that his lover has moved on, and he tries to forget but the memories are still too raw. Thatis why he feels like falling over the precipice, to rid himself of the burning pain. But these emotions will soon subside as long as he hangs on to what he has.<br /><br />'Deprived' (Irretrievably Lost Imagination) (8:27) follows with Riverside in a more contemplative mood with reverberating guitars, violin strings and an ethereal atmosphere. Kozieradzki's drums maintain a strong tempo and Duda's vocals are more estranged and laid back. This has a lovely saxophone sound, or clarinet jazz break out, and it cascades over the music with astonishing power. There are a number of tempo changes The lyrics are the dreams of the protagonist that have become fractured over time in a life that has become deprived of so many things; 'I live surrounded by cherished memories, I have a weakness for collecting them, Alphabetize, As far as I recall my childish rituals, Icons of that world always filled my shelves and heart.' I love the section where the sadness and loneliness is conveyed by poetic beauty; 'In a world of synonyms and handwritten notes, My own puppet performances, Endless bedtime stories, I could touch the moon and switch off the sun, I could have my dreams and dream about better times.' Perhaps this is the ray of hope now, the next phase of his life is beckoning and he is moving out of a depressed state to embracing what may come in the future.<br /><br />'Escalator Shrine' (12:41) is the longest song so I was hoping for layers of intricate musicianship and the band to launch full tilt into the heavier prog rock I loved so much on 'Anno Domine High Definition' and some of the songs on earlier releases. It surpassed my expectations and is perhaps the definitive track to check out if you are still wondering what all the fuss is about. This song absolutely blew me away. It begins with subtle quiet vocals and soft Spanish guitars over an ominous drone. The guitar takes on a complex signature and keyboard chimes sounding like The Doors' 'Riders on the Storm'; was Ray Manzarek in the studio? I loved this soundscape generated and the unusual signature works so well with the very innovative lyrics about feeling isolated in a crowded city, moving aimlessly along with the human traffic, as people move to places of mass consumption and buy things they don't need, and the protagonist feels more empty as nothing is real or still, and he is bitter and more convinced that everyone around him is putting on a fa'ade to hide their true feelings, that they too are as lost as him but are too self obsessed with the trivialities of life to admit it; even wrapping themselves in the cocoon of syber technology, laptops, mobiles and ipods, as they converse with faceless entities to compensate for friends, and pretend thay are not alone, 'We are stairway drifters, Made of cyber paper, Google boys and wiki girls, Children of the self care, We come to pray every single training day, Looking for a chance to survive, Buying reduced price illusions, Floating into another light, Melting into another lonely crowd.' Then it builds with a grinding Hammond harking back to the 70s era, and a hammering tempo blasts in like a tempest. The Hammond is given a workout and is an absolutely stellar performance from Lapaj. Guitars jump in and out of the keyboard freakout, a tantalising skin crawler, one of the best keyboard passages on the album. The pace locks into a crawl with beautiful guitar reverbs and Duda's echoing vocals. The time sig changes into the slow measured cadence similar to Pink Floyd's spacey atmospheres. The lyrics breathe out vehemence against the throwaway society we have become, and exude that our years are wasted trying to chase unattainable dreams as we drift from day to day; 'Dragging our feet, Tired and deceived, Slowly moving on, Bracing shaky legs, Against all those wasted years, We roll the boulders of sins up a hill of new days.' This builds into some powerful riffs with Grudzinski's heavy guitar emblazoned with stirring dramatic keyboard creating a wall of sound. At the end of this I was convinced I had heard a masterpiece track of immeasurable quality; simply a stunning achievement from Riverside.<br /><br />'Coda' (1:39) is the brief closing track, that glistens with sparkling acoustics and Duda's vocals with the same melody as the opening. He concludes with the sentiment that he has come to the point where he no longer wants to fall into blank space; a ray of hope at last; 'Want to be your light, Illuminate your smiles, Want to be your cure, Bridge between self and us, Want to be your prayer, Wipe the tears from your eyes, When the night returns I won't collapse, I am set to rise.' It feels like the end of Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' with the brief coda that wraps up the album.<br /><br />SONGS is an amazing album full of dark and light shadows, and poetic beauty. It has some of their greatest songs, namely the chilling 'New Generation Slave', 'Feel Like Falling' and 'Escalator Shrine'. Those three songs alone are awesome, but the album also has the more subtle quiet moods that will appeal to the now generation. The one thing that really impressed me is that the album is progressicve in every sense of the word with intricate time sigs, shifting tempos, comtemplative lyrics, dynamic musicianship and innovative layers of sound. There are many bands coming out that sound like they belong on the radio and they are only interested in cash cow singles. Riverside stay true to the prog roots that progheads adore and they do it in style with inventive ideas and some of the most incredible melodies and riffs; though it is more symphonic than metal, with Deep Purple or Uriah Heep sounds, a bit like Opeth's 'Heritage'. The Hammond flourishes are amazing over the heavy guitar textures. The album also grows on the listener as I noticed on subsequent listens certain songs are drawn to the ear with their beautiful meloides, for instance on my third listen in a row 'The Depth of Self Delusion' soon became one of my favourite songs, it has a relaxing serene atmosphere and Duda's vocals are wonderful speaking to our spirit. 'We Got Used To Us' likewise strikes a real chord with me, the melancholy touch and overall melodies are absolutely mesmirising. There is not a bad song on the album, even after multiple listens nothing feels like filler. In fact each track is complimenting one another with a magical entrancing resonance, until we get to the magnificent finale; the crescendo of power captured in the tour de force 'Escalator Shrine' epic.<br /><br />With so much quality displayed and with the layers and depth of musicianship executed here, I can only conclude by awarding this with the highest accolades. It is awe inspiring that Riverside maintains such a consistent high quality from album to album. 'Out of Myself', 'Second Life Syndrome', 'Rapid Eye Movement' and especially 'Anno Domini High Definition' are treasures of prog, and now 'Shrine of New Generation Slaves' is the pinnacle of their master class musicianship; a genuine musical epiphany. I hoped this would be an excellent album but I didn't expect it to have this much impact and resonate with me to such a degree. Strike this one down as another top notch brilliant masterpiece from one of the greatest prog modern artists on the planet.wn puppet performances, Endless bedtime stories, I could touch the moon and switch off the sun, I could have my dreams and dream about better times.'

B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It's okay. Sappy, but ok. would i rent it again no. would i watch it on netflix again yes. gg
B001O2ZW1A|3.0|Steven Wilson's 'Insurgentes' is a very dark, downbeat album with a black cloud of pessimism circling around it. It gets very bleak after a rather beautiful opening track 'Harmony Korine'. It is a blinding opener played in 8/4 and with Porcupine Tree nuances, and then the lights go out on 'Abandoner' that is so dark it is veritably chilling. The distorted sonic drones that emanate are disturbing but hold the interest. 'Salvaging' is a lengthy entrancing slow piece with Wilson chipping in on vocals with a downbeat monotone voice. The synth strings are very ethereal and take on a serene quality like music from a dramatic movie. There is a rather eerie passage of drones and effects at the end; perhaps as creepy as Wilson gets.<br /><br />Following all this bleak atmosphere is 'Veneno Para Las Hadas', opening with a very slow vocal over patient spacey keys and a pulsating beat that pumps along and maintains a degree of tension. The incomparable Jordan Rudess is guest keyboardist on this along with 'No Twilight Within the Courts of the Sun', a song with a King Crimsonish title and overall feel, that opens with Mike Outram's sporadic guitar bursts and an odd drum beat, perhaps a more progressive vibe than previous tracks. The fractured melody sounds like a King Crimson meets Porcupine Tree track. The proggish time sig is wonderful and it has a very long intro riff with Frippian squeaky guitars until it all cuts abruptly and Wilson whispers some reflective words. It builds to a louder chorus utilising the same shattered time sig. this may be the highlight of the album along with the opening track. It ends with backwards effects and then a shock of distorted riffs that begin unexpectedly until it all breaks down like a viny record slowing down to stop; a great track.<br /><br />'Significant Other' has a softer feel with nice guitar reverb and Wilson in his melodic gentle mood. This has excellent guitar phrases and has an uplifting vibe, though with an edge of gloom on those descending chords. It ends with experimental music box chimes. 'Only Child' has a more pop feel with a 4/4 beat, and solid melody with lyrics musing on Kurt Cobain, though Wilson's vocals are subdued like Thom Yorke. 'Twilight Coda' is an acoustic and keyboard instrumental with a bleak outlook.<br /><br />'Get All You Deserve' is 6 minutes of thoughtful songwritinng; the sparse piano and high register vocals create an atmosphere of isolation and depression. When the reverberating guitar chimes in the sound is augmented with a sense of dread or impending doom and it feels like Nine Inch Nails entered the studio and took over. The album ends on 'Insurgentes' that meanders along with slow vocals and an urgent piano.<br /><br />Overall this is way bleaker than anything I have heard from Wilson, even more so than 'Grace For Drowning'. While that release worked on a number of levels and provided a diversity that became a masterpiece to my ears, 'Insurgentes' plods along and has a depressing or strange oppressive effect. I was surprised at how disturbing parts of this is, in fact it tends to have an oppressive air of gloominess that pervades throughout. I prefer other Wilson projects but I am still in awe at the way he creates intense atmospheres and a wall of sound that builds from sparse arrangements. Not recommended for everyone, this is nevertheless a work of considerable passion with a penetrating air of estrangement.descending chords. It ends with experimental music box chimes. 'Only Child' has a more pop feel with a 4/4 beat, and solid melody with lyrics musing on Kurt Cobain, though Wilson's vocals are subdued like Thom Yorke. 'Twilight Coda' is an acoustic and keyboard instrumental with a bleak outlook.<br /><br />'Get All You Deserve' is 6 minutes of thoughtful songwritinng; the sparse piano and high register vocals create an atmosphere of isolation and depression. When the reverberating guitar chimes in the sound is augmented with a sense of dread or impending doom and it feels like Nine Inch Nails entered the studio and took over. The album ends on 'Insurgentes' that meanders along with slow vocals and an urgent piano.<br /><br />Overall this is way bleaker than anything I have heard from Wilson, even more so than 'Grace For Drowning'. While that release worked on a number of levels and provided a diversity that became a masterpiece to my ears, 'Insurgentes' plods along and has a depressing or strange oppressive effect.

B000FA5SMK|4.0|A little wordy at times but I'm learning that this is DeMille's style.  A good read overall, good enough that I bought the next book in the series.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Seriously! What the heck is going on with this industrial repetitive noise? It sounds like Rammstein meets Rage Against the Machine but far, far worse. This may be the 'St Anger' of death metal.<br /><br />I used to be a fan and considered 'Alters of Madness' a death metal classic when I was into that extreme style and along comes the latest Morbid Angel and of course I had to indulge after hearing the controversy surrounding it which has become a phenomenon in itself. Listening to tracks such as 'Too Extreme'; made me actually laugh which is a rare thing when listening to MA. I laughed because of the ludicrous music, the drum machines and awful singing, and I can understand how fans are going to react. 'Ten More Dead' is a shocking juvenile song with grade 6 school lyrics and uninspired riffing.<br /><br />'Existo Vulgore' is okay with massive guitar speed riffing but ruined by silly lyrics and throaty phlegm spitting and laughing. If I was a fan still, wanting some death metal and put this on I would be demanding my money back from the dealer, and telling him to place the album in the alternative section next to Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. Vincent even tends to channel Manson on 'Radikult' right down to the whispered chants and rapping, with axe chops of distorted industrial guitar. Hey, it's actually quite a cool track, though it's not going to help the band's reputation after fans have waited 8 years for some death and speed extreme metal; you won't find it here.<br /><br />There is very little to recommend it apart from about 3 tracks that are old school death and speed though they are rare. 'Blades of Baal' is a brutal breakneck speed thrasher that really shines among the dullness. It still lacks the ferocity of past MA but this is a killer track. But it is counter balnced by trash such as 'Profundis Mea Culpa' with ludicrous chanting and absolutely appalling musicianship. Vincent's screechy vocals are okay but those \\"ohwoowah... ohwoowah,, oooohhhh\\" invocations are beyond a joke.<br /><br />What I cannot understand is how the producers of this album and the band could not see the glaring obvious conclusion that this album is going to alienate old fans and perhaps kill their reputation permanently. I have seen the slogan RIP Morbid Angel and I can understand why fans feel that way. The hyper speed blastbeats and brutality of such tracks as 'Blades' would appease any fan of course. But delicious tech-death tracks such as 'Destructos Vs The earth/ Attack' are a real laugh a minute and destroy any credibility.<br /><br />It is impossible not to be cynical about music with lyrics such as \\"attack imminent, it matters not what counter measure you employ, destroy man, we're marching, destructors marching on...\\" It gets worse too with some bizarre lead riffs that are just processed and repeated through effects mixers.<br /><br />I like Rammstein but this copy of their style just does not work for death metal. Admittedly, after a while the style on display is so out of the box here that it becomes entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons. I became quite impressed at how awful the tracks are, a real feat in itself. It is a spellbinding album because it really could not be any bad for Morbid Angel, and it likely to become a cult over the years as 'St Anger' is. Morbid Angel are on another planet here and it is an unpleasant experience.<br /><br />So you have been warned. Definitely listen to this before purchase. And then skip it and buy a decent metal album. The 'Destructos' track actually ends with the ironic statement, \\"This impact is so terrifying that it may have an unforeseen effect.\\" Aint it the truth!ons are beyond a joke.<br /><br />What I cannot understand is how the producers of this album and the band could not see the glaring obvious conclusion that this album is going to alienate old fans and perhaps kill their reputation permanently.

B00DC7NNAC|2.0|That was ridiculous. In the bad way. Casting was ROUGH to say the least. Story structure & writing was fragmented & generally awful. It had a couple of moments, but I can only recall one at the moment: \\"Did those crows just say, \\"You're gonna die?\\"\\"<br /><br />Do the people making these movies just figure if they make it big, bright & pretty that the rest doesn't matter since they're targeting kids? That's the bar for spending hundreds of millions of dollars to tell a story based on \\"the words\\" of a classic? Are audiences so starved for a big, fun family flick that they'll put up with Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West? Really? I want my two hours and eleven minutes of life back.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It was a little slow to burn, but once it got going, it was completing ablaze. Its sad that the world can never experience Larsson's genus again.
B00884GR0W|5.0|It's a very good game with great graphics I recommend it for every minecrafter Please Note!! The controls are hard at first but you get used to them
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book because the premise seems a little off to me, but once I sat down and gave it a try, I was instantly hooked. Can't wait to finish the trilogy.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great story about the Tarahumara tribe in Mexico and how the author discovered and befriended them.  Not only is the story entertaining and inspiring but the discussion of human evolution and the differences between Neanderthal man and Homo Sapien was interesting and thought provoking.  Maybe it is time to set those expensive running shoes aside for a short run now and then.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|J-Hova. Yeezus. Pusha-T. The Holy Trinity of hip-hop. This album is incredible. The skeleton of this album is indeed hip-hop. However, the body itself is something else entirely. It's an emotional rollercoaster all the way through. Before anyone listens to this album, make sure you give it your full attention. It's art. It's one piece. Make sure the iPod isn't on shuffle. When it's evident that so much work and taste was put into a project, respect it, and let the body of work recieve your full undivided attention. Ima buy the CD. Ima buy the vinyl. Ima shoot a bootlegger! That's how I feel about Yeezus. Thank you Mr. West.
B008Y6UND6|3.0|Well - I really wanted to see this flick. However amazon only sells the movie - not rent--- at this time - ugg<br />The movie strays from the original Swedish version..<br />All in all I did enjoy the movie - with the David Fincher touch!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really like this love when I get frustrated with it and then finally get it. it is an exciting feeling.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I thought it was a cute movie with a pretty good message about determination and taking care of planet Earth.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|As an oral history this is a moderately interesting read. However, this is not really about zombies or a zombie war and is more about human reaction and psyche in times of trouble and turmoil, and in that endeavor, it is a mediocre read.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I listened to the preview tracks when this album first came out, and I was unimpressed. It sounded like the songs really weren't all that different from each other. A year or so later I finally picked this up (i.e. downloaded it) and I was blown away. I'm not going to pretend that I'm some great expert in music; I'm not. But I like music a lot (who doesn't, right?). Amy's voice is as powerful and moving as ever. Obviously some songs speak to me more than others, but in general the lyrics are very thoughtful, and the songs really do stand apart. I am especially touched by \\"Never Go Back,\\" which was apparently inspired by the tsunami in Japan. Other favorites are \\"Swimming Home,\\" \\"Lost in Paradise,\\" and \\"Erase This.\\"<br /><br />As a side note, I don't own the second Evanescence album, The Open Door. That one seemed to be on a different plane, and I couldn't really connect with it. This album is very easy to connect to, and I haven't stopped listening to it for the 2 weeks I've had it. Highly recommended!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I read Les Miserables many years ago in an English paperback edition. But this version seems longer and more detailed. I'm enjoying it. Having the book on my phone means it's always there when I have a moment. I thoroughly enjoy the Classic novels and this is definitely one of them. Victor Hugo is like a great artist who intricately &#34;paints&#34; each character of his epic novel down to the last detail.
147674355X|3.0|SPOILER WARNING: Lots of spoilers here. Maybe ALL of the spoilers. Read at your own risk  TRIGGER WARNING: Child abuse, child sexual abuse, incest, and suicide. Read at your own risk. Yeah, all the spoilers are in the trigger warning, but people who might be affected would want to know.    It's a difficult book to rate, because it seems to have two distinct parts. The first half is cutesy-faff; the second half is issue-based. The second is much stronger; the first is annoying.    Dean Holder. Especially in the second half, he treats Sky Davis well. A little too well to be believable, but this is a romance novel, so that's to be expected. Thing is, I don't believe he's eighteen or nineteen. He seems like a man. Maybe because I've seen the cover for Book 2, and the model is clearly in his twenties. And I didn't know teenagers were legally allowed to get tattoos in the US. Or rent hotel rooms. And how did Six track down Holder's phone number?    Anyhoo, Holder bashes up things, and even people. He bashed up a guy so badly that his victim will likely be deaf in one ear for the rest of his life. Readers are supposed to think this is noble, because Holder was defending his dead sister, but I'm not a fan of violence. It's not what happens to you that defines you; it's how you deal with it. And if you deal with it with violence, then you, dear sir, are a violent d-bag.    He's also a stalker. Even Sky is smart enough to realise this: \\"...you admitted to looking me up on Facebook right after meeting me. Then you insist on running with me, even though it's out of your way. Now you somehow know how long I've been in public school? And that I was homeschooled?\\" But she still doesn't tell him to nick off, so does that make her an enabler, or just someone who thinks with her cooch more than her brain? That's likely, because Sky orgasms simply from dry-humping, with everyone's pants on. Magical Peen.    I guess that's my biggest problem with this novel. That because Sky has Holderand his Magical Peen, she can heal fast from the revelations that she was routinely raped as a child. There's this Family Guy <a href=\\"[...] that explains most of my issues with romance novels: \\"All your problems can be solved by my penis.\\" If Sky was single, would she have healed as well or fast? That seems rather insulting and condescending to sexual assault victims.    And I don't believe Holder has loved her since Sky was five years old. Do five-year-olds even know what love is? I believe friendship. But that Holder's loved her all this time seems...paedophiliac, or idealised, or just plain creepy. I don't know what love is, but I know what it isn't.    Also, I'm not sure in which situation a neighbour's kid would be alone with the police chief so he could sexually assault her. Especially considering Lesslie and Dean were inseparable. That just seems too much of a coincidence.
1579128149|4.0|My 10 year-old granddaughter wanted this book. Of course, I got it for her. The day that the book was to arrive she ran into the house and asked her grandpa, &#34;Did we get a package?&#34;  The last few weeks of school she took it to school with her an read.
1623420148|5.0|Loved it so much, I could not put the book down! Had to finish it all in one sitting! I am in love with all of the characters in this book, cannot wait to see if there will be a second book!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The levels begin to really challenge you almost from the beginning. I haven't had much time to play, but I will soon. I hope.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Had a lot of action. The witch thing was confusing. The actors were OK, yet not memorable.  May be  nexttime.

B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Well, there were a few funny lines in this movie, but that is it.  Definitely NOT my kind of humor....  Rent something else.
B00271HAK8|4.0|A man with priorities so out of whack doesn't deserve a car like this. This is a hilarious movie fo real.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I don't know what they were thinking when they chose the cast for this movie. The CGI was cheap and unrealistic, the actors delivered cold and unbelievable lines and the costume design leaned more towards an S&M movie rather than a children's show. Too much skin-tight leather pants a leather bosom corsets. James Franco plays the part of the Great and Powerful Oz but his character is never warm, never wise and always sleezy. The story was terribly written and poorly executed. The little china girl was the best actor in the movie, and SHE WAS ANIMATED!  Just TERRIBLE!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great details and also enjoyed the beautiful poem  \\"when tomorrow starts without me\\".first time reading about this topic and now I want to read more. It's heart warming.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The anticipation and build up for this 3rd book was not worth it and I feel very disappointed. Waited 8 months for post-poned release date for nothing.I can't<br />put into printable words my dis-satisfaction with this book. We deserved better!!!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It is usually hard for the third movie to live up to the original, but this does and nails it. Chris Nolan has de-constructed Batman not a as comic book fanboy, but as a professor looking at the mythos we create and use in story telling. He ability to have a grounded universe in which an emotionally scarred billionaire would become a masked vigilante who fights other super villains is a possibility is amazing, but to match that with the fun a great action movie. Very few franchises have made a 3rd act as engrossing or enjoyable, but we get the cycle of growth that was inherent in the first movie. The Batman is no longer needed by anyone, except for Bruce Wayne who does not know what to do with himself not that his life goal/passion is a liability not just to Commissioner Gordon, but to his own health. We see the physical and psychic toll it has taken him and the only end he sees for himself is as Batman dying in a fight with the evil that is rising. We also see that as the Joker was Batman opposite (chaos to his order), Bane is the road not taken. His childhood was filled with such trauma that Bruce's seems like a minor scrape. The story telling never sacrifices the rules of the universe it created to give in to the demands that good guys overcome or have a happy ending. It does what ever story should do that while some stories end, new stories are just beginning. If you enjoyed the first two movie, you will not be disappointed with the final act.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun for me and my daughter to play and don't have to worry about horse poo cleanup :) easy to use for this busy mom and daughter team!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|While the effects are top notch, the whimsy or magic of &#34;Oz&#34; is not there. I know it is unfair to compare it to the original, but if you are going to make a prequel to the &#34;wizard of oz&#34; about the wizard, it needs to at least have the same fun into transporting you to the another land. James Franco does a good job as the man behind the curtain, but he seems to be too laid back to be a good enough con artist/show man. His lack of wonder at being in a completely magical land and the lack of growth he displays from being a flim-flam man to becoming the great and powerful oz seems rushed. Michelle Williams, who plays Glenda - the good witch, seems to be the only one who had fun with her role. I thought her playing good witch would be a one note as we all know the bad guys are more interesting. But as the good witch, she is at once naive and wise, showing that while Oz is not what she wanted, he is what she has to work with and sees the good in him. Conversely, Rachel Wiesz and Mila Kunis as the wicked witches would have more opportunity to expand and play up their roles, but their performances were uninspired, lacking any real threat just part of the explanation of how the wizard and they came to be. It seems the best lines/heart were left to Zach Braff as his assistant in both lands and the little china girl. Their scenes along with Michelle Williams' were the only ones that pulled you into the movie. Also, the other citizens of Oz were also there as scenery and to move the plot, Rami did not take to opportunity to introduce us to a another wondrous group like the munchkins. It was enjoyable, but not a movie that bring out the child inside you.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie does it again - I find myself absorbed by his writing style and characters over and over again. This ended up being a 2 day power read as I just could not put it down. Definately worth the cost - I will be rereading this again in the future.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|To get one great super hero movie is lucky, to get three good ones is amazing, and to do it with multiple heros working together in one movie is a heroic feat in itself. Joss Whedon, a god to fan boys, delivers a fun great action packed thrill ride. Thor and Captain America were good movies, the Iron Men were great, getting all the stories to link up and not having the movie studio screw it up must have taken an effort worthy of fighting the Hulk to accomplish and Whedon does it. The movie satisfies all fan boys wishes and still delivers a good story to the uninitiated, in which we get a super hero team up that does not collapse under it own mythos. The personal stories of each hero get enough screen time without losing the pacing of a good action movie. Downey excels as his quick witted and obnoxious but you seem love him Stark, and Chris Evans as the old-fashion but shining symbol of America can do, does a solid job as providing a ying to Downey's yang. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk lends a sorrowful tone missing in the others and we see that less Hulk is good just like in the old TV series. He is only there to smash. Loki really just serves as an excuse to get all these heros together, but there are a few good lines for him. If enjoyed the other movies (besides he hulks) you will enjoy this one.
B00457WZEI|5.0|A wonderful story.  Could not put it down until I finished it .. Now I would like to see the movie
1610390938|5.0|I am not quite finished with this book, but i must say it is a great read! I have learned so much from this book in such a short amount of time! If everyone in America read it I think it would be a revolution in the way we treat the impoverished population! I highly recommend this book to all!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved this story and anxious to continue with the sequel. The plot was a simple cat and mouse escapade thru the East Coast. Well done.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its so fun and easy some were hard only two i would get it if i didnt have it .Cant wait till more levels are made;)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is the heartwarming story of a man, trying to get his life out of the fog and back to the clear blue sky and a woman, who is battling a similar problem, finding each other. Very touching. Moves well.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|This is the era of movies that must run at 100mph and avoid any kind of characterization.  So, in that respect this Star Trek is a success.  I would love to give a detailed review but I can't remember most of it...there wasn't much memorable.  What I can say is the writers must have take a week off at one point because there are a couple of scenes stolen word for word from older Trek movies and series.  I guess these might have been meant to honor the older show but for me it was just really lazy.  There was one actually good moment where Kirk tells Spock he is scared.  When I saw that I thought, wow if they had used that kind of emotion and humanity in the rest of the film it would have been awesome.  Oh well.  Watch this by turning off your logic circuits and enjoy it as a silly movie with all kinds of issues covered up by lens flares.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game, I just wish it had more levels to play. Kept me playing till I found all the clues
B000HF6XKO|4.0|This movie is comparable to the Jason Bourne series in many ways.  Difficult message to deliver well and it was delivered well, thowever, the various story lines are difficult to follow. In the desire for action pacing, perhaps some of the &#34;filler&#34; information was cut.
B009Z8HPYM|4.0|It seems that Neil Young's muse will never desert him. This is another timeless offering which contains both long and well developed song structures, along with a big handful of videos from the most prominent tunes from this fine record.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie, likely one of my all time favorites with a soundtrack to match. If you have a Blu-Ray player andor 3D capable device, this movie is a MUST OWN.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|A fine mix of tunes from their glorious career recorded a few years back and only recently released along with a feature filled movie that I've heard is also great. Any music lover from the 70's or 80's will love this fine collection recorded in Great Britain at the O2.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book for the Kindle after much hesitation, but I am glad I did so. Wool was an excellent read. It is a post-apocalyptic novel about people who don't know how they got where they are, or what they are doing there, or what their future is.<br /><br />For a self-published novel, it was well-written and edited. The book was a joy to read and well worth the small amount of money paid. After I take a breather, I plan to read the others in the series.<br /><br />Look for this to be made to a movie within a year or so.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|this game needs you to have a microphone and a as you the kindle does not have a microphone so you cant do anything.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app for exploring the world or just your special interests.  It's easy to use and the pictures are beautiful. Sort of like creating a scrapbook.
0061537969|4.0|I first want to say I really liked the story. It was interesting imagining what a dog really thinks. After all haven't we all wondered? All of the racing dialogue I wasn't that interested in, but anyone that likes car racing would enjoy it I'm sure. It does have some off language so if that would offend you it may not be your book. I don't care for the language but I would have hated to miss the story. I sure enjoyed Enzo.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was very profound for me.  It has made me think about my own fears and where I have blocks that keep me from living my life fearlessly.  I'm sorry Anita had to experience this and I am so glad she decided to stay with us to share her wisdom and experience.
B00BF11STU|4.0|There were many acronyms in this movie and it was a little hard to follow throughout, but I was able to get the just of it.  I wasn't bothered in the least with the water boarding techniques used by our government.  In fact, I thought they were rather tame, compared to other forms of &#34;torture&#34; that have been used on American POW's.  I admired the woman who never gave up on capturing/killing OBL.

0061950726|5.0|An outstanding novel. I have always been interested in the orphan train riders and their stories. After reading this book, I want to explore more books about the riders. I cannot imagine coming on train to the midwest as a little child all alone.many heart breaking stories.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph<br />John C. Reilly<br />Great family movie/entertainment. We laughed then cried, and laughed again. Great price. Great value. Overall was funny.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I am one of Rod Stewart's biggest fans and this album delivers. I got the cd just before an eight hour road trip and I learned the words to every song on that trip-- the music is that good! I have my favorites, but every song is beautiful.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|If the script and the actors (most likely prompted by the director) had played it straight up as a serious drama, the film would have been significantly better.  Most, if not all, of the jokes fell flat especially the milk bottles.  The special effects, costumes, and design elements were excellent.  Most probably a rental, but certainly not something I would see again.
0307474275|4.0|I saw the movie, Angels and Demons well before ever picking up this book (I never saw the Da Vinci Code movie).  Luckily, I got this book for free and from the moment I picked it up, I was completely captivated.  This is mostly a fast moving book and before you know it you will be on chapter 20 in no time.  It did have a few lulls towards the end of the book and part of the ending became a bit predictable.<br /><br />Being the research freak that I am, I started looking into parts of this book to find out what was fact and what was fiction and I have to say that I'm still on the fence as to whether this book should remain as a \\"fiction\\" book.<br /><br />I'm not going to be like others I've read here and dissect the book to pieces as it just ruins the creative process and overall enjoyment of the storyline.<br /><br />If you want a fairly fast-paced book that keeps things interesting well into the night (or on days that you're sick and have nothing else to do but lounge around), then this book is a MUST.
B00006DEFA|4.0|I enjoyed watching this, however so many liberties were taken about Mozart's life, that I found parts of it not believable.  I liked that the music was &#34;the third character&#34; and I enjoyed the conflict and the setting, but I think Mozart would not have been as taken in by his enemies as suggested in the film.  Plus, his wife was a soprano that sang in his Masses, and he suffered the death of a son, both of which were not even mentioned.  I think these facts were serious enough to be included in the film.  I like poetic license up to a point.

B00633W614|5.0|I just loved this story.  Now, I am reading the next book in the series.  It is so addicting!!  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B006QPVGKG|3.0|The action in this movie is slow with plenty of time to get yourself a snack without missing anything. I'm a big scifi fan and really like most new scifi movies but this one's really a let down for me..<br />You should rent it and then see if you really want to spend money to order it.. If I had a clue that it was like it is I would have skipped it all together.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Read this book.  I know you've seen the series...just read it.  You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />Peace.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Now I understand the excitement behind this series!  I have not seen the movie but it did give me a reason to look into the books.  While I realize it was written for a younger audience I thoroughly enjoyed the story and am looking forward to reading the remaining books in the trilogy.  It also helped that it was available for free loan from Amazon Prime.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Used the app to track battery life and let Amazon know that my kindle fire sucked. It would die overnight in airplane mode.<br /><br />Since the kindle was still in warranty, Amazon replaced the device for free.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Having just finished The Hunger Games I jumped into Catching Fire right away and kept the story and characters fresh in my mind.  I read most of it on a couple long flights - easy to move through fast.  A continued great story and very much looking forward to the conclusion.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I need to watch a movie for class. I wanted to chose something in history.  The movie was well done the actors and scene, lighting and the storyline.  Cate Blanchett was brilliant as Elizabeth

B00CH87HF4|4.0|this game is very fun much more entertaining than I had anticipated. I can see myself playing this for many hours to come.
0425263991|5.0|I read the first few installments of this series and really, really liked them, but for some reason, I never got around to reading the last several books.  When I saw that this was coming out and I read the synopsis, I was immediately interested in seeing what Nalini Singh could do with this subject matter and with these characters.<br /><br />Let me just say that, while this is obviously part of a series, characters from past books do show up and/or play prominent roles, and storylines carry through, I didn't find it necessary to have been entirely caught up on the series prior to reading this book.  Ms. Singh did a wonderful job, in my view, of balancing the fact that she was continuing a long-running series with building Sahara, Kaleb, and their experiences in such a way that they could stand on their own while being true to the overall story.<br /><br />In terms of this story, well, it's very, very dark.  There is a lot of violence and torture and trauma, and all are of the physical, mental, and emotional varieties.  Both Sahara and Kaleb have lived through stunningly, intensely horrible and painful experiences (and that's actually putting it mildly).  To the credit of the characters - and to the author who created them - they were not defeated by all that they have endured.<br /><br />Sahara exhibited a remarkable ability to persevere, carry on, and reclaim her life and memories after years of violence and isolation.  Kaleb used his supremely rigid control to bury his emotions behind layers of ice.  As the characters discussed near the end, Kaleb wasn't necessarily a good man - he was cold, violent, ruthlessly pragmatic and could be cruel - and that's fitting because no one who had gone through all that he had at the hands of a vicious, cruel monster could have come out the other side being a purely good person.  That is not to say that Kaleb didn't have his own kind of honor and his strong bond with Sahara revealed a somewhat more tender, possessiveness, and ultimately loving side to him that was amazing to see.<br /><br />Their relationship was intense and had incredible depth from page one. For all of his shields, Sahara did not let Kaleb remain entrenched in the darkness and loneliness in which he had existed for so long.  She was there for him in every possible way, and her strength and faith in him allowed them to build on their shared past and memories.  Their romance was (super) hot and even surprisingly beautiful given all of the issues and traumas that they had to overcome.<br /><br />So, yes, this was dark, and it hit on so many different emotions that the story really stays with you.  You root for the characters, you feel horror at everything that was done to them, and you marvel at the strength of their relationship.  I think Nalini Singh has delivered the best novel that she's ever written (which is saying something) and I can't wait to see what she does next.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Works great as you'd expect but it drains the battery so fast. I know it's a broken record with all the other reviews but it really does kill it quickly.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I chose this book because I love Irish authors and stories.  I found the book to be an interesting and wonderful story.  The book had a little history, warmth, love, and sadness and kept me reading and satisfied.  I loved the characters and setting for the story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's novels and have enjoyed them so much.  I like the intrigue and how he is so passoniate in what he does.  Felt real bad when his wife died, wished that did not happen.  Cannot wait for the next one.
B00992CF6W|1.0|THIS GAME WONT INSTALL ON MY KINDLE FIRE!!!! I WANNA PLAY IT I WASTED 7$ ON NOTHING!!! NOT COOL PLEASE DIX THIS ASAP I WANNA PLAY THIS GAME SO BAD NOW
1591845556|2.0|There's a lot to learn about learning. This book scratches the surface (20 hours worth of learning about learning?) That's ok if the information wasn't very obvious (pick a desirable skill, break it down, practice practice practice).<br /><br />But my biggest disappointment is that I paid for a book on learning (or acquiring) skills fast and ended up with a set of manuals 'the beginners guides to the ukulele, the game 'Go', windsurfing, computer coding' etc I was surprised to spend my time reading about the history/background info on these things that I wasn't personally interested in and how someone else approached learning them using a style that worked for them. This is a book all about the author! Not about the reader. There was no mention that other people learn differently and that there's no one way. It just showcased some skills the author was interested in. Some people need to soak up more theory than others before confidently grasping new skills. Others don't want any theory and just want to get stuck in, especially if they aren't readers.<br /><br /> I feel the content of this book will lose a lot of people if they don't share the interest in the ukelele, 'go', windsurfing etc Given the hype created, it's a shame I feel so disappointed by this book. (Josh's other book 'the personal MBA' was excellent)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I didn't like the movie as much but the book was great. I really enjoyed it. I would read it again.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Awesome app  I like it<br />Those who love ww2 weapons you should get this app  because is a awesome app
B005LAII1C|5.0|As  native New Englander I loved this movie! Watch it over and over! Effects and great and the multiple copies makes it easy to view anywhere!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I was really hoping the Mila Kunis was going to keep tradition alive with her black swan style scenes. I sported a semi for two hours in anticipation... no dice.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|As always HBO delivers with a stunning set! Seeing it again in full HD is always a great experience! Love the Show and love the books!
B00C6B9PX4|5.0|I have own this on Laser Disc and DVD. Now I have pre-order it on Blue Ray. Scarface deserves a slot in my Blue Ray collection as it is a timeless treasure which I am eager to see it on HD.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I already had Season 1 (before the re-edit)but bought this as I didn't have digital copies of the series which I wanted. The Dragon's Egg was a huge bonus as that alone goes for $45 on HBO.com! If you haven't bought Season 1 yet or, like me got the original without the digital copies,  I would recommend this!
B003PIUC02|5.0|This is one of the TV series which I wanting for more. Good Storyline and acting but lots of fighting,blood and sex. I have to admitted that there are a few sences which took me by suprise. It is not suitable for kids or even teenagers and the faint hearted. It is solely a for mature viewer only. Andy died too early and young. This TV series is worth a keep on Blue Ray as one will enjoy it even repeated viewing from time to time.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Calendar days keep flying past. Deep Purple carries the Hard Rock flag high. Amazing that they continue to create spectacular tunes while others from their era have run dry.
0679805273|5.0|I am having my girls teachers write/sign the book. When my girls graduate we will give the book to them as a graduation gift. The book is a must have whether you are giving it as a gift or read to your children.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I loved this movie it was very entertaining the music was very good and the actors played their parts very well.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|The story was mostly predictable, the characters one-dimensional and the writing inconsistent. I stopped reading Baldacci years ago for these very reasons, but hoped he had matured as a writer. I was wrong.
B002GHHHP6|1.0|This DVD ws for Region 2.  I had never heard of regions before until I received this.  It WILL NOT play in the US.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|It is very fast and exactly what I needed for data transfer. Definitely recommended if you need multi port USB
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I chose to read this book because of the Percy Jackson series. It is very well written and The Red Pyramid also has that special way about it that sucks you in and keeps you wanting more. I also loved learning about ancient Egypt that I have never knew before.
B000002IQW|5.0|Nonstop A-1 rock and roll!!  This is one of the best rock albums of the 90's.  It is a shame they are not still together because we need more bands like them!
B009AMANBA|4.0|The story line was interesting and it took another viewing to really appreciate this account of Lincoln.  I guess I was expecting a more comprehensive view of his life, but it was interesting and stirring.
B000FJGWBC|5.0|&#34;Into the Blue&#34; is an awesome movie with a powerful storyline with a lot of gorgeous underwater photography and some bikinis mixed in!  It is a really good movie that I don't get tired of.
0670014893|1.0|I'VE READ AND PURCHASED JOHN LECARR E'S BOOKS FOR MANY YEARS. THIS BOOK IS THE MOST UNORGANIZED BOOK HE HAS EVER WRITTEN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|A great read! The TV series is very loosely based, but I would recommend to most people if they're in need of a captivating story
B008Y73940|4.0|I watched The Lincoln Lawyer from my Vizio TV through the Amazon Instant Video ap.  The movie was free (huge bonus!) as part of my Prime membership.  I love how easy it is to watch the movies through this ap and quality is always fantastic.  The movie was pretty entertaining too.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|This movie trilogy is awesome.  In fact,  because of it,  I've become obsessed with Mark Wahlberg movies. Since I purchased it, I've hunted high & low for EVERY Mark Wahlberg film. Needless to say, I have yet to be disappointed in any of them. If you love action movies,  you will enjoy this trilogy.
B00C061I3K|5.0|A little of a twist for Daft Punk. They delve deeper into the funk this time, and some borderline R&B. Not as electronic overall , but excellent album.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|interesting and it's a great &quot;brain game&quot;...Has you lost at times but this game puts your brain to the test ;')
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Great movie - it is the store of the Batman 2 video  game - my kid loves it!!!!!! Can't wait to buy the Star Wars one!
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I did have to download the current driver for Win8 other wise I would have given it 5 stars.<br />Satellite recognition is quick, 2 seconds or so and strong even when placed in the home or car.<br />Much better than the Delorme unit I used to use.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Great chemistry, lots of action. Gretel is one bad cookie , Hansel looks great. Love how the brother and sister dynamics were shown..

B005HSL626|3.0|The game is pretty good, but it is more for younger people than people my age.  I tried it and its okay.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I love Maggie Smith and the story was very intriguing. I loved the way they would go back and forth from current time to long ago.
B00110K62U|5.0|Les Miserables is my all-time favorite, especially when Colm Wilkinson appears in it.  He is my favorite.  I just love the music.

B00005JKNF|1.0|First of all the language they used  was very difficult to understand and then I lost out on the plot. Maybe I need to watch it again.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent writer. Powerful story. This book captured my attention in the very first paragraph. The author is also doing some great work in this field. Check him out on line (Eban Alexander MD)
