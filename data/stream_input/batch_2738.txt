B000FC1AGG|3.0|The main character started every sentence with &#34;Er...&#34; She had no self esteem or wit about her. That drove me nuts. The book never gave Jack's point of view regarding Emma, so I wasn't quite sure how he really felt. The author never built up an emotional connection with the characters- I was never emotionally attached to them. &#34;I've Got Your Number&#34; was better.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I love Baum's work, so could not resist seeing this.  However, it was over-produced drivel!  Not worth your time. Period.
B002BWCJOA|4.0|My kids love this movie. It just seems that our internet is too slow for good quality streaming. Netflix seems to be so much better...
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Can't even finish the book = too, too strange.  Hidden meanings? Messages?  Or just plain silly. Wish I had ordered something else.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Still worth watching even if you know what is going to happen.  I can't imagine what people thought when it first came out.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It was easy to download and works like a charm.<br />One touch and I know how much time I have left<br />before I need to re-charge it.  Much better than<br />looking at the kindle battery thingamajig!
B009JBWOU0|3.0|Had to complete the set. It is a good movie. I don't know why you are looking at reviews of this movie check it out on imdb.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Like I said, a good movie that your wife probably wants to watch.  Despite what I thought would be true, it was actually pretty darn watchable.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a grate game but could have different minions insted of just different costume download it now its an awesome game
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It is exactly what wanted and is exactly as advertised. Nice looking quality cover and holder for my Kindle. Can't go wrong with it.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Had to complete the set. It is a good movie. I don't know why you are looking at reviews of this movie check it out on imdb.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I LOVE playing MTG and when I found the application for my Kindle Fire HD and tried the free version for a while it made such an impression that within a week I bought the full version. I am very happy with it!!!!!!!
B007IK44CK|3.0|Tom Cruise will have a hard time besting this one; blowing up the Kremlin, the imminent destruction of the world averted at the last moment, and climbing outside a window on the world's tallest building using only a pair of sticky gloves made this laughable. Maybe it should be in the &#34;action/fantasy&#34; genre.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|This movie I had already seen when I had purchased. Amazing movie if you like the beatles and you like musicals. Highly recommended. Not happy with description of movie though. Was told it was in &#34;new&#34; condition. Got movie and the case was cracked and the cover torn off.
B003UYV08E|3.0|My ex's kids used my original as a chew toy one say so after she was gone I was able to replace it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. graphics are great gameplay is addicting and I like that you can challenge your Facebook friends. bravo
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|This movie is simply one of the best of all time! Charlie Chaplin is a genius and if you see only one of his works this is the one. Perfection!!!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|THIS book should be restored to school curricula.  It proves how hard work and love can carry one through trials.<br />STAFFMOM
B002OR0RP0|3.0|I rented it for my kids at school to watch. They really enjoyed it. I will give it a good rating for that.
6304698623|5.0|Its magical, a young girl full of heart, she helps the other girls through hard times.  Its shows kindness, and love.  Great family movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is brilliant because it is a very good game and the missions are good too. The character and the challenges are good too.
B0090SI582|2.0|With so many many comics, I have no clue how they went so wrong with this Wolverine movie.<br /><br />The plot is a huge mess.<br />The villains are laughable.<br />The action is not even good.<br />there are plenty of WHAT THE?! moments<br /><br />I don't want to go into details of the plot, but this Wolverine is for family.<br />There are too many jokes. the action is toned down. the characters are cliche.<br /><br />Jack man tried his best playing Logan. that's the only reason I even gave it 2 stars. very average at best.<br />& even then the Director & writer seem to never have read a Wolverine comic in his life.<br /><br />NO GOOD
B0079R8KO0|4.0|The case looks and feels good for the price. From the picture, I thought there was an inner sleeve, but there isn't. Overall, I like it and was happy with the delivery time.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|same issue as thejclay13, i put all the parts on the ga 990fxa ud3 and powered it on, fans and stock led lights would work but would show no display on the monitor ( i used a 1600 watt power supply and two zotac geforce 560 ti's) so i removed everything from the motherboard except the power supply just like a gigabyte rep told me too and he said i should get a beep code from the beepbox if components are removed, but i got nothing and so he then said that the motherboard was doa, which means dead on arrival. so buyers be aware of this motherboard before you purchase, thanks
B00003CXCW|5.0|As a rule, I stay away from stories that are tragic (like Shakespeare's, for example).  But this one has strong moral value to it, that if you try too hard to make yourself happy and beautiful, you make yourself miserable and ugly.  It also demonstrates the ultimate cost of compromise.  William Holden and Gloria Swanson, and really everyone in the cast, deliver awesome performances in what is known as the definitive movie about Hollywood.  Gloria Swanson plays an extremely unbalanced woman named Norma Desmond who is out of touch with reality, believing she is still Hollywood's greatest star about 20 years after silent movies have been replaced by sound movies.  Sunset Boulevard is highly original and far from formulaic for a \\"film noir\\".  While it is a dark movie, the great thing is that it arouses fascination for more than just the inevitable tragedy you anticipate.  It shows the full gamut of Hollywood's glamor and hard realities, and is unforgettable in its depiction of a silent movie queen's mansion and her encounter with Cecil B. DeMille (played by himself, of course!).  William Holden's character, a second-or-third-class Hollywood writer who's run out of options, is appealing enough to interest you in his story, but not so appealing that I felt badly when he made dumb choices that led to his downfall.  His crucial mistake was to call Norma Desmond's house to get his belongings after he'd already left, similar to warnings in the Bible about fleeing from temptation and not looking back to Sodom.  Lest I give away the story, I'll conclude by saying it has 1) excellent cinematic storytelling, 2) a good theme displayed through tragedy (though I don't watch a movie just for that), and 3) a time capsule about the facets of Hollywood in 1950.<br /><br />If you're interested in special features, be sure to get a DVD such as the Special Collector's Edition or Centennial Collection, both of which, according to other reviewers, have the same stuff.  The Special Collector's Edition is what I watched, and contains a documentary about the movie, an audiocommentary, a documentary about Franz Waxman (the composer), a documentary about Edith Head (the costume designer), film clips and script pages of the original prologue, and a map with little audio descriptions of the places used for filming the movie.  (And along with the Katharine Hepburn/Spencer Tracy comedy Adam's Rib, it has one of the best theatrical trailers I've seen!)<br /><br />It's one of those movies you never forget after you've seen it once--but the memory of it doesn't haunt me so much as fascinate or stimulate me.  It even became laughable when I watched it a second time!
1781162646|5.0|It's not scary but it's a must read never the less. It will keep you guessing as to who done it until they finally tell you, then when you know for sure who it is you are like no way. I didn't see that coming. it can be finished in one day as it's a short novel. only 183 pages but a great read.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Incredible earthy, soulful, controlled vocals with beautiful musical arrangements, and great songs.  It is one of those albums that I'll never tire of listening.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Check the size of this product.  The box is about 5 X 5 X 5 and it was 50$...total rip off for what you are getting and I am just sick since my son's b day is this week coming and I can't do a thing about THIS now.<br />grrr
B005K17RU0|5.0|Important for us on the Gulf of Mexico to have an accurate weather and map of our location.<br />We need to make plans in case of hurricane approach or other storms to interfere with outdoor plans.
B00499NHLC|5.0|No matter how many versions of this character there are there is always room for one more. We really enjoyed this newmodern take on the character. The acting is fantastic. Love the interplay between Sherlock and Watson. Almost through Season 2 and looking forward to Season 3.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its handy for if you are playing a game and can not see the battery or whatvhing a bid when you cant see it it will sat 10% if you shan't it to.best tool app ever
B008220C38|3.0|Not your regular style movie.  Uses a theatrical stage most times as if in a live theater production.  Tries to be too &#34;artsy&#34; at times using frozen motion, overly elaborate gestures and flash.  Not what I expected.<br /><br />Plot okay if you can get into the overall mood of the picture and forget the unnecessary theatrical additions (annoying visual distractors).<br /><br />Liked it but it would have been great if delivered as a regular styled movie w/o all the fake stage production, curtains rising and falling, and all the props.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Probably not.  But the colors were great and Keira and &#34;Kitty&#34; were beautiful to look at.
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|Graphics are nice, but very little information there.  Means having two weather apps if I keep this one.  It would not take much to add some more details, even if you have to drill down a bit for them.
B000NY12CI|4.0|I am amased by her understanding of multiple cultures accross continents including Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. She came forward out of her comfort zone and helped us understand many things we probably would have not known otherwise. I commend her language and writing skills as well. Hope this brings a cultural revolution. And hopefully the book reaches the intended target i.e. muslim men and women.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I am always trying to increase my high score. I thoroughly enjoy playing Jewels. A good game for any age.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|I thought we were going to be in for a romantic version of Zombieland or Sean of the Dead. Instead they gave us a mushy lame love cures all message. My husband and I both hated it. I dislike movies that show the best parts in the preview, hence the single star.
0061124958|5.0|My 8 year old grand-daughter is an avid reader and loved this book.  The teacher read it in 2nd grade and I then ordered it for her.  This will be forever in her &#34;classic collection&#34;<br /><br />Happy Mom-Mom
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This movie has everything I remember as a kid reading Thor comic books. Great action, even some comedy. Eagerly awaiting the sequel.
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen radio stations from mexico all day long.I strongly recommend this app. very easy to use it.I love it.
075669812X|4.0|My son wanted this book because he is a lego collector. He was very excited to get it and he has enjoyed reading through it.
1449433251|5.0|RIGHT MEOW! You definitely will want to keep this with you and whenever you have a family to pass it down, it is one of a kind. I'm happy I purchased these, you can either read this during a poop phase or when you are simply traveling on an airplane to pass time.
B006BQNJR8|2.0|Bad acting, bad writing. Even the action scenes are boring and predictable. Only watched it because it was free and streamed.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! Sometimes bells or ocean waves aren't enough to put me to sleep. This application allows me to choose so many different variation from city noise, lullabies, nursery, ocean, pond, and so much more!
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|The game is great fun and challenging as well. Much imagination obviously went into the design. Graphics and color are outstanding. We got the Spanish versión first and I have to wonder why a bag of Gold Clubs costs about  $1 versus $7.99 on this one ?! Anyway, get it you will like it if not love it.
B000YAA68W|4.0|A book many people should read. It is easy to read and understand. It allows you to how life was like before the war.
0393330435|4.0|After spending a day with Woz over 20 years ago, at the very first vertural classroom he created, it was great to see his compassion for the educational classroom. His book fills in the the blanks for his passion for progress in his industry. Lead on!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Television as it should be. Superb writing and acting. Wonderful glimpse of life in another era. Well worth watching! Enjoy.
B00006ALA8|5.0|One of the best that Queensryche has to offer.  Would recommend the DVD Audio version for anyone who is able to play this format.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I can't say I LOVE this DVD, but the results were great.  I just have to turn the volume off.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Good solid game. It has good controls and is fun to play but it will try to get you to spend money on it which can get annoying but is to be expected. Over all I have enjoyed it.
006178480X|4.0|This book is typical James Rollins reading fun. I find the earlier Sigma books more detailed in characterization, but this book is perfect for a summer escape by the beach.
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|it was ok but i was not impressed.  it didn't really hold my attention.  do not think i would read anything else by this author,
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo was always one of my wife's favorite shows, so I decided to get this set for her birthday this summer. I'll have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Not all transfers of older TV shows come off well, but this one is excellent. The picture is sharp, with vibrant colors. The picture is so sharp that it even looks good without setting the TV's display ratio to 4:3, which for many older shows is an absolute requirement to get the best image. The sound is accurate without distortion, though at times it will drop out for a second. If there is a quibble, it is that there is film damage occasionally evident in the presence of little flickers of spots.<br /><br />All of the original Columbo mystery movies are included in the set ... even the original movie made and aired years before the series started. Plus all of the later special TV movies are in the set. So if it's Columbo, it's here.<br /><br />While I always enjoyed Columbo myself, I'll admit that I often had to take him in small doses. LOL I like Peter Falk, I like the mysteries and the writing, I like the guest stars, but sometimes I sort of wished that the murderer would pull out a gun and end Columbo's endless nagging. :-) Often the guest star murderer was a much more entertaining and sympathetic character than Columbo, and if they didn't start out that way, you certainly had some sympathy for them before the movie was over. Despite that, I enjoy the shows, and am well familiar with all of them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0098460O4|5.0|Got this for my daughter as a gift a couple of months ago and she loves it. She has been watching this couple on her computer and really enjoys having this CD now to listen to in her car as well. My oldest granddaughter (15 yrs old) was just as excited about it as my daughter was.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|FOB has been my favorite band for ten years, and if you've stayed with them on their journey, you'll love this one too. The focus is definitely on stadium rock anthems, and while sometimes it seems Pete's sharp lyrics suffer as a result of this, the music and Patrick's voice are extremely catchy. This is the rock album of the summer, the yin to Kanye's Yeezus yang.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|New updated version is a mess.  So I am going to look for something else and cancel this one.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
6302787068|5.0|The movie i had my wife had torn it while trying to take it out, once this one came in it filled me with joy the movie was just as described
B005LAIII0|5.0|The cinematography is excellent.  Ang Lee deserved to win as Best Director this year. The Life of Pi is a movie worth seeing.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Started out promising, but becomes predictable and underdeveloped love story half way through. Loses itself as it goes on. Do not understand why this received rave reviews and nominations.
B001APXLOG|5.0|The book arrived timely and was in perfect condition.<br />The recipes are easy to follow and have turned out delicious ice cream.<br />I would recommend the book and book seller to everyone.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Close to the text; but a few significant changes. Still a beautiful movie. I recommend it, but be sure to read the book to notice the differences they've made in the movie.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I believe people of all ages can enjoy this book.  It took me back to my childhood memories and it shows what a little determination can do.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|There are so many facets of WWII that continue to get glossed over in American (and apparently European) classrooms.<br />  This is a must read.  A page turner from the first word.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This was not Charlaine Harris's best Sookie Stackhouse novel. But I needed to read it since I read all the other books.  I am not upset with the ending - as other readers seem to be.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders Game represents one of the true classic works of science fiction.  It is a must read for anyone that claims to be a sic-fi fan.  I actually got this to reread as it was one of the genre shaping works from my childhood.  Surprisingly, all of the years between reading it as an eager sic-fi loving child and reading it as a jaded middle-aged man made no difference at all.  I was once again drawn into the story.  It was nice to be a child again and ironic given that Ender never go to be.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Kelly Clarkson did it right with this CD and selected her best hits to include. Really great songs. Would recommend this CD if you are a Clarkson fan.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I will forever wonder what my dog is thinking after reading this funny, sad, inspirational tale.  One of the best reads ever!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was entirely lost in this book. Love the character of Jace. I will be reading these over again I'm sure.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It moved along and was well written, but very strange premise. I was amazed by the twists and turns. Not sure I would recommend it.
B009NG1Q96|1.0|This mad cry it mad my smile. This is the BEST book I have read. It's better than the hunger  games
B004SEUJ82|5.0|It was very realistic for the time period and got better as the film progressed. Very good actors too. You would think that the film<br />was documentary. As I say, I loved it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Awesome- can't wait for the next book! I was hooked after book one!! Love  this series and author, definitely destined to become a movie
B00008OP0H|5.0|Somehow, I missed this series when it was first broadcast. When my son loaned me his set for a year, I was hooked. I was so impressed with this series of ten segments such as The Breaking Point, Bastogne and Why We Fight that, when it came to return them, I bought a set for myself. Now I have it to watch whenever I want. The set I have consists of five DVDs as well as a bonus sixth DVD, &#34;We Stand Alone Together: The Men of EASY Company.&#34; My wife, who says she doesn't like &#34;war flicks,&#34; also watches with me. It would make a great present; just make sure you get yourself a copy first!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie first. Loved it. Then decided to read the book. Loved it. Great teen book. Definitely recommend to high school students.
0307200477|5.0|I had the smaller version of this book before my toddler decided that the cover needed to no longer be attached to the rest of the book.  I was happily surprised upon receiving this at the durability of the larger book and it's cover.  With even a few more pages included than in the smaller version, I was impressed at the quality of this edition!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is awesome!  I only wish there was a help screen because I do not know what everything means.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Fabulous read. Watch movie afterwards and it didn't come close to the emotional connection received from the book. Makes me watch to read again
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I adore the book and movie, now the equally amazing soundtrack completes my 'Memoirs' collection! At least I don't think there's anything else to add, lol.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So worth it....need the other floors though. Cant wait for the other floors to become available.  Have fun and enjoy!!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|The app takes to long to download.when i search something up it takes to long to search. Im going to erase the app and find a better one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very interesting and challenging game! I couldn't stop playing it! please create more levels for us. we are patiently waiting!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Johnson uses fine characterization and interesting use of time frames to examine the nature of human identity against a backdrop of contemporary international political tensions.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We bought all 5 seasons and pre-ordered the rest.  Love this show and now we can watch whenever we want!
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|I enjoyed this app, but after an hour of play, 31% of my battery was drained because of this app, so says the android battery details.  what gives?  this is a brand new nexus 4.
B008YCMM2A|3.0|Interesting release but i cannot let all the  5 star reviews go unchallenged. My problem is the second quintet is unbeatable. This band sounds like they are copying the ideas of Hancock Carter and Williams, but have far too little playing time together to pull it off convincingly. I have most problems with DeJohnette. thrashing about far too often.  I  think he lacks the swing & pulse that Tony Williams gave to the band.  The reviews talk of the free tendencies of Corea and Holland  but i don't think that explains it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Fun show I enjoy it a lot. The actors do a very good job.  The characters are very engaging.  Except Weaver.  Not a big fan of him.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|great game I would reccomend it to anyone who loves bingo.<br />anyone would love this game. very nice people to meet on here to.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I finished all the levels for the first island and  I couldn't go to the second island! So I did over the first 7 levels again and I still couldn't go to the second island! What the heck! It's a good thing that is free! Although it was fun to bad I couldn't  play all the levels!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005UG542S|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the previous characters and some of the older tricks and visualization shown all in this last movie.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and got a good price for the two disc edition. I think it would also make a good gift.
B000W8HC8I|3.0|The book was ok, the second half was more interesting than the first. The story itself was pretty good but it just reminded me of the movies with Charlie Sheen; Wall Street and Money Never Sleeps.
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|The afterlife turns out to be what ever you create with your life. It can be pleasant or unpleasant. Both are illustrated in breathtaking CGI in this<br />Orpheus Euridice update.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|The movie stayed true to the book but I'd imagined a flashier Mickey but enjoyed the driver and the drama
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this as the first book(s) to put in my new tablet. I really enjoyed the story and love that could get the entire trilogy in one set.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Second season is just as good as 1st season.  We have nothing to add beyond our first review other than it continued to be great..
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I don't understand why you had to change your app. Liked the old version better. Slowly getting used to this one. Just wish it would choose my hometown upon opening.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. Yes, it did contain very explicit sex acts, but the romance was intriguing. The drama unfolding left me breathless and craving for more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game I have ever place you should play it sometime what are you waiting for download it and play it.
0316227706|5.0|This is an incredible book. The pictures are absolutely amazing!!! The different expressions on the dogs are awesome!!! No two are the same!!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|I love this show with its twists and turns and characters you love to learn to hate and love. To bad it is not on anymore
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I've had this app for a couple days then I was watching a video and it stoped working so I closed it but the sound would not turn off
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved it . I can wait to see what they do next. And this I can let my 8 year old cousin play.
B000K4X5XA|4.0|There was no problem with the order. Everything was as expected.<br />It would have been five stars, except the movie is a little outdated. I remember laughing about the phone-booths with everyone else in the theater years ago. Now, with cell phones, this generation and even I, don't even chuckle.<br />It is still a great movie and a tribute to Christopher Reeves.
B008C20TDG|5.0|If you want to wake up with energy, sleep well, lose weight and have extra mental clarity, among other things, you need this book and the Whole 30!  It's worth it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game, love the horses, very realistic too. Horse are nice and can be upgraded. Best. App. Ever. Nothing is wrong with this app.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a great game. I play it a lot. But I wouldn't necessarily say it's the best racing game. But I do give it a thumbs up
B00785P2QC|4.0|I Love this game makes me feel like I'm in my own world which I am all the time great game...must play I have all three of my kids playing we all have our own little city...if you haven't played please download and play it...<br /><br />Thank You to the creators but I don't like that I have to write a book just to say how I feel about the game...
B00C4SUEJI|2.0|not I@Ws best album.  the music is cluttered and incoherent at times.  The overall theme is reminiscent of 70's light rock. Listening through the tracks brought me back to childhood days of watching The Partridge Family and The Brady Bunch.  I'm not sure if this was intentional. However, I'd question the judgement of the artist if that were the case.<br /><br />All and all, not a step in the right direction.  70's light rock is dead and gone for good reason.  it was never that great to begin with.<br /><br />if you like I@W.. I'd probably recommend The Shepherd's Dog or any earlier works over this album.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|There's no way for me to know if this book is truthful, but it sure seems like it is. It seems well-researched and mostly unbiased. The author appears have a fondness for Jobs, which is fine, but doesn't pull punches when exposing his dark side. A great read. Fantastic marketing lessons. And a great history of Silicon Valley, as seen through the Apple lens.
1439152802|4.0|Having read 3 of Morton's novels (however, it was awhile ago) I decided to try another.  I noticed the reviews were \\"all over the place\\".  I did enjoy her other novels - with some minor issues. I have read many books lately on my Kindle, but purchased this as a paperback = wish I had purchased it on my Kindle.  I found I missed the Kindle dictionary - and, the Kindle usually picks up some of the British vernacular as well.  I did have some trouble with this, but that's not the author's problem. This book may not be for everyone:<br /><br />It is not a book to pick up and read for a day and then come back to it next week = you'll forget the bits and pieces that you will need to keep track of.  As one reviewer said - it is a jigsaw puzzle!  It has lots of twists and turns and one needs to pay attention.  A love story in part, but very much a mystery.<br /><br />It is not a book that flows easily from point A - Z.  It goes back and forth in time, and with characters.  I saw it bothered some.  As for me, I had no issue with the back and forth between present and past = it kept my \\"senior\\" brain active.  And, there are MANY twists and turns - the ending being no exception!!  You're not going to get \\"spoon fed\\" with this novel.  Also, Morton's writing is such that you really need to \\"listen\\" to what she writes.  Many times sentences \\"light up\\" the reading experience with so much meaning.  She does this nicely.<br /><br />Yes, I agree with some that it is very long and very wordy at times.  But, the way she writes with so much depth, I would hate to miss those special \\"sentences\\" that seem to say so much...  In other words, \\"Listen again to what you just read\\"... Not preachy, just thought provoking.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? - YES

B004J4WNL2|3.0|I'm only 80% through the book so far, but I can honestly say it's way too long and wanders off on tangents too much.  If one removes all of the other related personality types that she discusses ad nauseam, the book would be 1/3 of its length.  So far, I've found very little that actually celebrates introverts or helps us cope in an extroverted world.  She simply wastes type explaining the barely related personality types.

140006922X|4.0|Since so many have cut and pasted John Dickerson's review as a conservative Christian, I thought I may insert a review by a more liberal Christian scholar.  I thought this review was quite fair.<br /><br />Reza Aslan on Jesus: A Biblical Scholar Responds<br />A review by Greg Carey<br /><br />Reza Aslan's Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth has taken off as a cultural phenomenon. Just two weeks after Aslan's interview on NPR's \\"Fresh Air,\\" his interpretation of Jesus' life and intentions has attained number one status on bestseller lists. A ridiculously hostile FOXNews interview has certainly helped. But it's been two weeks -- and as yet I cannot find a serious review by a practicing biblical scholar. This brief review amounts to my attempt to respond to the questions I'm receiving about the book from every corner.<br /><br />Aslan gained wide popularity for his introduction to Islam, No god but God. I very much enjoyed my copy and still consult it. Aslan holds a PhD in sociology, but his primary scholarly emphasis involves contemporary religion. Aslan has also worked in New Testament studies, and Zealot contains references to a vast amount of literature, yet the book also betrays that he is not immersed in the literature of that field. Aslan is a spectacular writer, and his portrait of Jesus is spiritually if not intellectually compelling.<br /><br />Allow me to address the common complaint that as a Muslim Aslan has no business writing a Jesus book. Aslan clearly respects and admires Jesus. That some Christians might find his claims unsettling is, well, tough, because Aslan is doing serious intellectual work. The complaints have no place in responsible public discourse.<br /><br />First, Zealot has formidable strengths. Aslan has done a great deal of homework, offering material that will instruct many specialists from time to time. The most important thing Aslan accomplishes involves setting Jesus in a plausible historical and cultural context. Indeed,more of the book may involve Jesus' contexts than direct discussion of the man himself. Someone very like Jesus could easily have existed in Roman Galilee. Aslan's Jesus is thoroughly Jewish, passionately committed to Israel's welfare and restoration. Aslan appreciates how Jesus' activities amounted to resistance against Roman domination -- as well as against collaboration on the part of Jewish elites. Many scholars would agree.<br /><br />Any respectable portrait of Jesus must take serious account of how Jesus died, as Aslan's does. Jesus dies as a convicted seditionist, a would-be king who finally got caught. This is a serious interpretation of Jesus' crucifixion. Perhaps Aslan most deserves credit for his openness to the possibility that Jesus really did see himself as Israel's messiah, or king. Far too many historians dismiss this possibility out of hand.<br /><br />Many traditionalist Christians will struggle with Aslan's handling of the Gospel stories. Maybe they don't teach this in some churches, but Christian thought developed a great deal in the decades following Jesus' death, a fact Aslan recognizes. I do wish he were more careful in spelling out why he finds certain Gospel traditions more historically plausible than others, but again any credible account of Jesus' life must recognize that the Gospels do not provide direct windows into Jesus' activities.<br /><br />I would add that Aslan provides some of the most helpful discussions I have yet encountered regarding the accounts of Jesus' healing ministry and of his resurrection. These stories represent minefields for any historical investigator. Aslan handles them with sympathy, imagination, and critical judgment.<br /><br />At the same time, I have some serious reservations about Aslan's portrait of Jesus, and I suspect that most professional biblical scholars will share some of them. First, the book contains some outright glitches, things a professional scholar would be unlikely to say. Aslan suggests there were \\"countless\\" revolutionary prophets and would-be messiahs in Jesus' day. Several did appear, but \\"countless\\" is a bit much. Aslan assumes near-universal illiteracy in Jesus' society, an issue that remains unsettled and hotly contested among specialists. At one point Aslan says it would seem \\"unthinkable\\" for an adult Jewish man not to marry. He does mention celibate Jews like the Essenes, but he seems unaware that women were simply scarce in the ancient world. Lots of low-status men lacked the opportunity to marry. Aslan assumes Jesus lived and worked in Sepphoris, a significant city near Nazareth. This is possible, but we lack evidence to confirm it.<br /><br />Two of Aslan's glitches, however, bear directly upon his argument. Readers of the Gospels know that Jesus often silences those who would proclaim his messianic identity. We call this phenomenon the \\"messianic secret.\\" Aslan claims that Jesus himself veiled his messianic identity in order to avoid detection by the authorities. He also claims that Jesus used coded language to promote his vision of the Kingdom of God for similar reasons. Most scholars will find these claims just silly. For example, Aslan notes that many interpreters credit the author of Mark with inventing the messianic secret as a literary device. Aslan rejects that view on the grounds that Mark's author lacked literary skill. Mark certainly features rough Greek, but appreciation for Mark's remarkable literary artistry stands as one of the most important scholarly findings of the past few decades. After all, how many spellbinding storytellers lack proper grammar? The misguided idea of a secretive Jesus figures importantly in Aslan's overall argument.<br /><br />I would like to conclude with a few critical but constructive observations.<br /><br />First, Aslan seems to assume that Jesus' crucifixion demonstrates that Jesus himself fomented violent sedition. That conclusion is far less obvious than Aslan admits. Crucifixion shows that the Romans regarded Jesus as a threat to public order -- and they did. (See the two chapters on Jesus' crucifixion in my Sinners: Jesus and His Earliest Followers.) However, one did not have to practice violence in order to experience Roman wrath. The Qumran community may have anticipated a holy war, but we have no evidence they ever marched out to battle. We have firm archaeological evidence that the Romans destroyed their community in 68 C.E. In other words, Jesus need not have promoted violence for the Romans to see him as dangerous.<br /><br />Second, Jesus' resistance to Rome need not have promoted violence. Aslan does a wonderful job in showing how Jesus' \\"triumphal entry\\" amounted to a public demonstration. He demonstrates that \\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's\\" promotes not good citizenship but outright resistance (Mark 12:17). (I've written on these topics as well.) Aslan is aware of how deeply Jesus draws upon the book of Daniel -- but he does not acknowledge Daniel's main message. Daniel called forth a community of the wise who would resist their wicked rulers without employing violence. Just as the Judaism of Jesus' day included rebels, it also featured streams of nonviolent resistance. That is where most scholars locate Jesus.<br /><br />Third, Aslan is almost surely correct that Jesus was a faithful Jew who observed the law of Moses. (This may surprise many Christians, but almost all scholars agree.) Perhaps Jesus was \\"zealous\\" in this sense. Yet it's difficult to square one feature of Jesus' ministry with the portrait of Jesus as a zealous revolutionary: the Gospels' remarkable insistence that Jesus enjoyed the company of sinners. Matthew's Jesus acknowledges how his circle of friends led to accusations that he was a drunkard himself (11:19), while Luke posits that sinners and tax collectors (collaborators!) actually enjoyed Jesus' company (15:1-2). Hard to see a zealot acting like that.<br /><br />Finally, Aslan seems to have bought intoan outdated model of Christian development. According to that model, Jesus was a mighty prophet, but it took decades for the idea of Jesus' divinity to take shape. Aslan imagines a Jewish Jesus tradition that developed without the trappings of a divine Jesus. It took the Hellenized Paul and his circle of Gentile converts to start the church on the path to Nicea. Paul, Aslan asserts, \\"created\\" the figure of Jesus as \\"Christ.\\"<br /><br />Contemporary scholarship is undermining that familiar model. For one thing, Paul was not nearly so removed from the teachings of Jesus as Aslan assert. Paul's connection to the Jesus movement goes back to within a couple of years of Jesus' death, and Paul's teachings resonate with some of Jesus' most characteristic emphases. Moreover, we find \\"high christologies\\" -- assertions of Jesus' divinity -- from the earliest stages and from beyond Paul. Daniel Boyarin, a leading Jewish biblical scholar no less, believes that Jesus saw himself as divine. (I mention Boyarin not because I agree with him but because he represents a non-Christian take on these developments.) Matthew's Gospel, the most obviously Jewish of the four Gospels, emphasizes people worshiping Jesus. The old model that Paul \\"invented\\" devotion to Jesus the Christ, particularly devotion to a divine Jesus, simply does not hold.

B00DRDVHA4|3.0|Marc Anthony has set the bar very high previously and vocally I think this is best performance ever... the phrasing and nuances in tone are tremendous... I mean i'm listening to this album purely because Marc's voice has never sounded this dark (in a good way).<br /><br />BUT, there is a massive problem and that problem is largely Marc's decision to choose Sergio George. This production fails to achieve for 3 core reasons and Sergio and Marc have to be held to account for all of them.<br /><br />1) The salsa arrangements are bland and all the songs sound the same (except Vivir Mi Vida which is really a pop song and La Copa Rota which is a bolero). Sergio is capable of more as he showed with DLG's debut, La India's \\"Dicen Que Soy\\", Marc Anthony's \\"Todo A Su Tiempo\\" and more recently Luis Enrique's \\"Ciclos\\". Sergio seems to perform better when he is inspired by a new artist or a comeback artist, Marc is neither of those. Also, people should remember that \\"Contra La Corriente\\" was produced and arranged by Angel \\"Cucco\\" Pena not Sergio and that has been the best album of Marc's career.<br /><br />2) All the tracks have clearly been produced to be radio-friendly and time in at around 4 mins. So i'm listening to this album and the songs seem to finish in a rushed manner and I realise it's because the call and response sections have been cut to about 1 min. As such the section where typically you'd get 2-3 mins of interplay and improvisation between the brass section, rhythm section, and singers just never happen. Have a look at the timings on Marc's previous salsa albums and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />3) Marc is now such a superstar Sergio (and maybe any other producer) can't influence him like he used to. I'm thinking that some sports stars become so big that the ego makes it hard for even an experienced manager to control them. I'm not saying Marc has a huge ego (I really don't know) but clearly it's the job of the producer to guide an album and an artist to achieve results. I'm not sure whether Marc has become too big and Sergio couldn't do that or whether it's Sergio not trying hard enough or being strong enough to influence Marc. Either way, the results speak for themselves. In interviews Marc talks about he and Sergio finish each other sentences and they are on the same page musically and I feel like that's an issue on this album... Marc should be pushed to achieve something else, greatness comes from the friction of ideas. It's pretty clear on this album that neither Marc or Sergio were being pushed to do something greater.<br /><br />I'm just calling it how I see it. This is Marc Anthony and this album is an event. You expect much much more. I feel like too many salsa producers from PR and NY/Miami are doing the same same production line salsa... is it too much to ask that Marc and other bigger name salsa artists set the standard and look further afield (like Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, etc) for a producer that may shake them up a bit and produce something different???

B005LAIIPS|3.0|I didn't have very high hopes for this film, but I was curious what they would do to go beyond the absolute perfection of the Bourne trilogy.  The Damon film, which we must contrast to this offshoot, balanced many factors:  Bourne was vulnerable but an expert killer (i.e. realistic), the shadowy CIA/NSA group was believable and timely, and the principal character's plight and search were compelling.  Unfortunately, the Bourne Legacy doesn't quite succeed at any of these.  I will attempt to go into the reasons for this without revealing plot spoilers.<br /><br />First, pumped up by some kind of magical meds, the new character is more like a superhero.  His abilities and even his intelligence are enhanced by biotech.  In other words, we are almost if not quite in Spiderman territory.  So the good guys are better, the baddies badder.  Second, in its attempt to deepen the conspiracy, we learn that there is another group, never defined and perhaps more deeply entrenched, that is masterminding the new efforts.  It includes scientists, military types, and some kind of ominous organization that even Ezra kowtows to.  While the film is skillfully interwoven with events that were seen in the trilogy, advancing the story of Landy and her enemies, the new group feels grafted on.  Third, the principal characters - played by Renner and Weisz - lack the tightness of focus that Bourne had in his need to overcome his amnesia and discover the mystery behind his conditioning.  Taken together, I simply couldn't quite suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />Finally, there are many holes in the film's plot - the viewer doesn't know how characters figure out certain things, e.g. when Aaron springs up in Dr. Shearing's house to save her in the knick of time.  How did the new conspirators find the couple in the Philippines?  WHere do they get their money?  Why would Shearing throw herself in with Aaron?  Presumably, some of this may be explained in subsequent films, but the effect is to lessen the film's believability further.<br /><br />That leaves the viewer with the tried-and-true situation room, where a team tracks our heros as they elude everything they throw at them, and then there are chases and good fights.  And the minute you see Weisz, you know she is going to be a love interest of some sort.  Of course, Aaron will almost certainly \\"bring the fight to your doorstep\\" in sequels.  It has the feel of a formula film, another mega-franchise.<br /><br />Oddly, it works best if you separate this offshoot from the original trilogy in your mind.  Viewed that way, it is pretty fun action/scifi.  THe actors are all good, if rather 2-dimensional.  Recommended.film's believability further.<br /><br />That leaves the viewer with the tried-and-true situation room, where a team tracks our heros as they elude everything they throw at them, and then there are chases and good fights.

0425252868|5.0|An amazing true account of humanity during and encounter by two enemy aircraft over the war torn skies of Germany. A very refreshing perspective on the German experience that is seldom if ever explored by contemporary authors.<br /><br />This book draws attention to the plight of the German airman during the war, how they fought bravely against great odds, diminishing resources, and insane commanders who's grasp on reality was sometimes staggeringly absent.<br /><br />Even though it was written by an American, he does portray Franz Stiggler's flying career with humanity, and one realizes that the German airmen were young men, like their English and American counterparts, and that they all shared the same ideals, wishes, hopes and fears. An outstanding book, and an even more moving experience of two foes meeting in the skies over Germany, and the chivalrous act that followed. A must read.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I can't believe this guy has been overlooked for so long. Amazon recommended it after I finished the most recent Rothfuss book, and their algo nailed it. Couldn't put it down.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I only learned of this show at the beginning of the 6th season and enjoyed it so much my wife and I ordered the 1st season to catch up. This show reminds us of how the word 'class' got its name. The writers have created stories that leave you fully engaged, and have reminded us of things we take for granted. Take for instance the introduction of going to work dressed to impress! And how about the time when people used electric typewriters! I never heard of John Hamm before, but I'm sure we'll be seeing and hearing much more of him.<br /><br />He plays the part of a man with a plan to the hilt. The trouble is, he has a past he is running away from, and as he states in an episode with someone from his past, \\"There's only one direction my life is moving, and that's forward.\\" The show also reminds us of the introduction of popular ads we now view as commonplace. There's Lucky Strikes, coffee brands, women's clothing. They've obviously done their research because I feel renewed pride in my work from watching how this show reflects we all have an important role in what we do, only sometimes need to be reminded. This show not only entertains you, but for me has reminded me where I've been and where I am now, and what's more, I can be proud of who I am. In short, I haven't watched a show like this where I feel good about who I am and how I dress in a very long time.

B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Great songs with a melody that is both easy to learn and follow along.  DR has a wonderful way with musical expression.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Having read all of the other Sookie Stackhouse books, I was happy to get the final installment of her saga. While I was a little disappointed in who she finally chose (I was routing for Bill) it did make sense.  I will be sorry to not read about Sookie anymore.
0783225733|5.0|I grew up in Cocoa Beach, Florida, where my Dad was a very senior engineer on the Apollo program.  It was a huge part of my childhood. I was about as educated on the program as any layman would be.  And I had my Dad (but not for long enough) as a great technical &#34;consultant.&#34;  He saw and admired the movie, as did I.<br /><br />I was especially impressed by the scene in which Lovell is controlling the critical rocket engine burn before returning to earth orbit ... but every movement with the joystick must be made in REVERSE.  I couldn't imagine how an experienced pilot with thousands of hours of stick time, and ingrained habit patterns cultivated over decades, could possibly do such a thing!  It sounded like Hollywood.  So I asked my Dad; Sure enough, the scene is accurate.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, fun and very true to life movie about a key event in a unique time in world history.  Along with another favorite of mine, &#34;The Right Stuff,&#34; it gives a great perspective on the US manned space flight program.<br /><br />Also highly recommended is Jim Lovell's book, &#34;Lost Moon,&#34; from which the movie was taken.  THAT was required reading demanded by my son's university before he arrived for his freshman year in engineering school.  But unlike too many textbooks, this is one book you can't bear to put down...
B003VANOFY|1.0|UPDATE 5/12/15: Just... don't buy. I'm really starting to feel like these are $10 headphones with a $90 warranty. These have been a pain in the neck since day one. I know I praised the service in my original review, and it is good, but the product just sucks on every level. My first pair lasted a year, and I'm about to receive my third replacement since then.<br /><br />I bought these three years ago because my G35s broke -- THOSE were pretty reliable and it was my fault for breaking them -- and each new pair of G930s I've received has been a joy for the first couple weeks.But, whether it's the constant cutting out, the battery losing charge too fast, or the finnicky USB receiver -- you will never have a fully functioning pair of G930s after the honeymoon phase. Google any of the problems mentioned in these reviews and you'll see these are common and are not solvable.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've used a lot of headphones, and these have been some of my favorite. I won't tread all the same ground all the other reviews have, I just want to add that Logitech has some of the best customer support out there. I bought these over a year ago and they broke -- they sent me a new pair completely free. When I tried to get something as simple as a replacement USB cable for my Naga Epic, the company that made that said it was &#34;impossible&#34; and I needed to buy a whole new mouse. Logitech by comparison was a breath of fresh air.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever, when I first got the app, the controls were a little bit difficult because I first started playing survival craft, but in about 30min its really fun. Hope you enjoy this app as much as I did.
B008602KQI|5.0|My students loved reading this book in class and they loved the movie as well. Just make sure that you plan on reading the book first because my students did say that, had they watched the movie first, they would have been so confused about all the action and the plot. Books are obviously much more descriptive but, this movie left so much stuff out from the original book. So, have students make a compare/contrast chart for the book and the movie. Believe me, they'll find all kinds of stuff that was different from the book...haha. Then go further in-depth: ask them to examine what changes to characters, plot, etc the omissions in the movie make on the overall story.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|I love Freddy Kruger and It is a must have for anyone who love nightmare on elm street. great collection.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Nexus Q was one of my favorite tech devices of all time and I mourned its demise for months. Enter Chromecast. The Nexus Q 2.0. Smaller and simpler than ever. I can now bury my Nexus Q and move on...<br /><br />What I love about Chromecast:<br />1. Plug and play--open box and plug into HDMI port: 40 seconds<br />2. Setup--the whole process is as simple as can be. Like they say, it just works: 3 minutes<br />3. 3rd party app support from the start: I loved seeing Netflix already supported. (Hulu?? Are you going to join the party?)<br />4. Browser sharing: YES! Love it.<br />5. Out of site: the little dongle is 100% hidden behind the TV.<br />6. This thing is so popular already I'm sure we'll be seeing lots more apps soon.<br />7. So cheap!<br /><br />What Chromecast doesn't have on the Nexus Q:<br />1. Playing music without having the TV screen running. I get it--using HDMI is easier all around but it's a pain to have to turn on the TV if you just want to listen to music.<br />2. The glowing space-age orb. Maybe I'll donate it to a museum one day.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the series. I would highly recommend it to others. It is one series that takes you away. I'm glad I started watching it. Great acting.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Upon downloading this item and reading \\"options\\", I still didn't know what to do with it. When you clicked on some object it would enlarge, but you could do nothing. How is this game supposed to be played with no instructions?
030758836X|4.0|I really liked most of this book, but just as everyone else says, I had a problem with the ending. It wasn't wrapped up the way I wanted, but that only loses it one star. I loved the first 90%. I couldn't put it down, and I was recommending it to everyone I know. But when I finally finished it, I stopped recommending it so enthusiastically.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE! Definitely not for those with a light stomach or opposition to gore. However, this movie is one of my all time favorites with Robert De Niro playing his usual self in this gangster film. It's a must see for any movie fanatic. THANKS!!!
B001VIMCW4|4.0|While not a huge fan of Daniel Craig, if you put aside him as James Bond, the story line is full of action and excitement and is certainly entertaining.
B000Y1H7VA|5.0|I was but one of many long time fans that eagerly awaited this albums release back in 2007. In all honesty, I was a bit nervous to find out if Corgan and Chamberlin could really pull off an entire project themselves. Not only was I impressed with the results, but I felt so happy and proud for Billy and Jimmy for being able to create an album that retained most of the key features that made every other album of theirs so memorable. That's when you know an artist, or a band of artists, is being artistically honest with themselves and their fans. If they maintain that regal authority that made them famous instead of manipulating their work in order to fit in with the mainstream, you know you've a got a highly respectable band on your hands. That's exactly what Zeitgeist does; reminds me of why I fell in love with The Smashing Pumpkins when I was a child.<br /><br />Jimmy Chamberlin continues to impress and only furthers my notion that he is the most important drummer of his entire generation. Although he too has selected a shallower snare drum in the same manner as many modern drummers, this never affects his precise time-keeping and energetic performance. Even if his drum work is not as varied here as it has been on past albums, I was mostly pleased to hear this man doing what he does best.<br /><br />Billy Corgan's vocal work is rather impressive. While many singers tend to loose their range and precision with nearly twenty years of experience behind them, all that time seems to have taken little affect on Corgan's abilities. I found myself very attentive to Corgan's delivery on numerous occasions. There are several songs on this CD where Billy makes clever use of vocal overdubs. This technique adds a pleasant dynamic to his singing that is seldom present in past albums. I think it is fair and accurate to say that this record contains various songs that can easily be counted among his best vocal executions.<br /><br />Perhaps the only real problem I've found with the album is that several songs are mixed too loudly. You really must adjust the volume a few times in order to find a comfortable level.<br />Related to this issue is the onslaught of over-dubbed guitars. Now, if you're an SP follower, it needn't surprise you that many songs contain multiple guitar tracks all mixed together. That's one of the hallmarks of most Pumpkins records and it almost always sounds warm, sleek, and regal. However, I feel they went overboard with how they did it on this release.<br />Indeed, some songs are simply overwhelmed by Corgan's riffs and solo's (although, said riffs and solos are quite good). Chamberlin, who received substantial praise form critics, fans, and colleagues for his performance on this project, is sometimes drowned out by what sounds like an entire orchestra of Billy's vocals and guitars.<br /><br />Given what I've written above, it won't come as a surprise that my favorite songs on the album tend to be the ones which feature the keyboards and vocals prominently, rather than the typical guitar and bass-driven numbers. Although I can say that all of these songs are good, my favorites are clear:<br /><br />Track 3 - Bleeding the Orchid<br />Track 4 - That's the Way My Love is<br />Track 8 - Death From Above<br />Track 9 - Bring the Light<br />Track 10 - Come On Let's Go<br />Track 11 - Neverlost<br />Track 12 - Stellar<br /><br />To conclude, Zeitgeist may not garner The Smashing Pumpkins any new fans, but I do believe that it will satisfy those of us devout who have long been fallowing their genuinely impressive career.album is that several songs are mixed too loudly.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a classic!  Even after watching it several times the first 15min still brings a tear to my eye.  A touching story that shows the importance of companionship that motivates and challenges us to move beyond our comfort zones and experience life more fully and help us avoid collapsing into lonely, paranoid & pessimistic bitterness.
0671449028|5.0|This is the 5th Sandra Boynton book I have purchased because they are all awesome!  I plan on buying the rest ASAP.  My 9 month old loves this book.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Rollins and each book delivers excitement, entertainment and more importantly, lots of fascinating facts on the subject of the book.
B00124HR22|5.0|I've been listening to Alice since I was five. His music is part of me. Of all my AC favorites, \\"Killer\\" is on the top of my list. As a composer/musician (MaddVille Musick Co.), I deeply respect his work, as well as his awesome band. My wife bought the CD for my birthday, and mistakenly did not get the mp3 download for our Cloud player, which is really cool.  Amazon went above and beyond to rectify the problem and I recommend the \\"Autorip\\" feature that you get as a bonus for buying certain hard copies.  Thank you Amazon and thank you, Alice!  The CroppieMan
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Pretty great until that whole lovey-dovey thing recommend to anyone who likes surprises<br />And a lot of drama read the next 2
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good for focusing, pattern building and picture recognition.<br />I know my children and I will continue to enjoy this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Boss battles are a little repetitive. Overall awesome sauce. What are you waiting for? Do it. Download it. It's good. Seriously.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Since I am not a fan of martial arts movies, I was hesitant in watching this movie, because it was mentioned in so many reviews.  However, this movie has a great story line, right from the beginning, mystery and suspense with a few scenes of so-called martial arts action, which are short but effective.  I just refer to thee scenes as kicking-butt-and-taking-names! I loved it and would recommend it!
B000002JOF|4.0|I really only wanted it for one song.  I've listened to it a few times, but not a lot, He's good, but he's an acquied taste, not mainstream
B005544V6A|3.0|The first season is a pretty standard legal procedural. The cases aren't that enthralling, but the dynamic between Mike and Harvey is entertaining to watch. The second season picks up a lot more. The first season is a good start, but not the most compelling watch out there.
145150506X|5.0|Great book! I purchased this as a gift for my son.  He really enjoyed it. Shipping was super gas and he received it way before I expected him to.  Great service!
B0094LDZ9E|5.0|I like the music, especially because its not all kiddie songs! My kids love this movie, the music and the dancing.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I am not a Will Ferrel fan, but find this movie fun and surely brings on the Christmas Spirit.  This as become part of our  family viewing tradition.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent show, keeps you coming back for more!  I can't wait for the next season to arrive.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Very fast read and full of action. I have liked all the Reacher books before but this was my favorite.
B000087F6M|5.0|As one of many videos that I am replacing, I have not watched it yet, but am looking forward to it.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|This DVD set is good, but I have the feeling that I am getting half the story of John Adams.  The time this series spends on the American revolution and Adams term as President are far too brief to show the struggle of the war or the issues of the country while Adams was President.  Was Adams such a sourpuss that he had no friends amoung the other founding fathers?  Certainly, the pictures this series shows of Washington and Franklin are little more than the image a young schoolchild gets in a second grade level book.  This series does somewhat better with Thomas Jefferson, but I feel Tom Hanks would have served his subject better had he given us  a seven part series covering the Revolution and latter, another seven part series covering the rest of Adams life.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I vaguely remembered seeing this in theaters when it came out and thinking it was amusing but most of the witty one-liners kinda blew past me at the time. Watching it again, I really appreciate the inventive storytelling and dry humor :)
B002DQLGHU|5.0|My niece had one movie but not the first Harry Potter movie. I own all of them personally so I am trying to start her collection.
B009K72G8I|5.0|We just finished watching season 5 and it was great. It is an action-packed and funny series according to my son.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Very good graphics .... with a good surround sound system , the giants are in your living room! I had them in my semi .... good movie ....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My mom and I finished season 2 and said we couldn't wait for 3 to come out.  It was completely worth buying season 3.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|The movie itself is fantastic. It is a restore of a classic film. It is slightly dark but the original was not much better. I didn't expect HD quality from an old film but it looked good. No graininess and good sound. Plus a great price. It was twice the price in stores.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the jacket it came in was very abused. All the corners were beat up and torn. It didn't appear to be the packaging but rather that the item was sitting in a warehouse for a while. The person who packaged should have noticed the damage. If this was for someone else I would have returned it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Likeable protagonist - really good Sci Fy conceit - using old people to fight wars.  Worth the money and the time.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Fun game of logic. Relaxing but challenging. Nice for all ages....grankids and I really enjoy challenging each other.  Definitely recommend.
B001N18HP0|5.0|This is definitely the Pearl Jam album to get. It has Ll of their most popular songs including, Black, Jeremy, Alive, etc. A must-have for Pearl Jam fans.
B000067CPX|5.0|Recently I lost the 1st CD I had of &#34;By the Way&#34; and received the 2nd one in perfect condition.  By the way, the CD does sound way better than the copy I was listening to on utube. That's why I rated the product a 5.  By the way, if I were to rate the time of delivery, I would give it 4 stars as it took a couple of weeks to arrive, but it did arrive within the delivery estimated time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have played!!! It's really fun and I would recommend for anyone!!!:-) love you Minions
B000024MKV|5.0|I put this one in my car recently after having it for a couple years. While I liked it the first few times I heard it, when I 'rediscovered' this playing it in the car back and forth to work, I realized what a gem it is. It starts off with a couple good rockers, with 'Make My Day' really getting the fist pumping and then it slows down a bit for the next two and you start to wonder if this album is going to have the steam to make it, but then you get a nice six minute Whitesnake type blues rocker/ballad in 'Let it Be' with great guitar work and vocals and you start getting back into it. LET IT BE got me through some difficult traffic and was an exciting and yet calming influence at the same time. The next song is a ballad that works well especially after the euphoria that is Let It Be. Then you get another good rocker, then Track 8 hits you like an ABSOLUTE FIST IN YOUR FACE! Wow, if you are not fully into it by then, well, this music just isn't for you. The rest of the album retains its momentum with very solid melodic rockers. There is plenty of nice variety in here and the album overall is a great pleasure to listen to....so good that I just had to write this review. I have most of the Gotthard albums but after listening to this one again, I WANT MORE so I will be searching out the few that I don't have now.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked it, not just porn by exciting and captivating. Mad me buy the next book.  Need to know where this goes next!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love it! just installed it on my kindle. so addicting! got the whole family playing this game too love it
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in ages and had forgotten how hilarious the move was. Thoroughly enjoyed our evening, and the rug really did tie everything together.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is a very funny movie. We think it is as good as the other movies that came before this one.
B0089MXRII|4.0|Twelve months of a Soviet childhood is just that - twelve select glimpses into the childhood of an average child growing up in the USSR that was still some time away from collapsing and was yet offering the simple comforts of the socialist system. The short stories do a good job of transcending the formulaic representations of the much vilified regime and showing the children are children and childhood - no matter where and when it takes place - is still a magical time, filled with adults who know and care, places that are exciting and new and simple joys such as seeing the sun after endless months of winter. Amid these rosy recollection, however, I would like to see some more of an exploration of the darker side of the regime, glimpses of which we all caught. The propaganda littered television, the slowly but surely worsening economy, the indoctrination of the school system, the communist party as the sole beam of light and hope and all the other things that made the regime fail so utterly at the beginning of the 90s. At the same time, I do understand that the author's core mission was to concentrate on the beauty of childhood, which she did with nostalgia and tenderness.
B00A2FSSHK|4.0|Great movie - had been a while since we had watched it. Hold up over time very very well. Enjoyed
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I had not watched Mulan before until my Pastor taught a lesson on it and the connections you can make through it with Bible -- very good.  I tried to rent it but there was a very long wait -- so I just bought a copy.  I'm very glad I did -- it is such a good movie.<br />Thanks for the entertainment<br />Twila
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found The Piano Guys on Youtube and I was hooked - this is an amazing cd of amazing music!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I find this game enjoyable not so much in solving and completing the different levels but in the ability to determine how the levels can be solved. Try putting Satan and then God into a level. Dragons are pretty cool also.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Fabulous setting, marvelous classical music, humor, great characters, interesting costumes, real musicians some sadness,<br />finale is tremendous. Go get it!!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I really LOVE The Piano Guys music and I was super excited to listen to this cd - I wasn't disappointed!  Another awesome CD!!!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm not much of a game player, but I enjoy the creative thinking that must be used to move up to each new floor.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A fun and exciting ride that has one wanting to reach the end.  Quantum physics, alternate realities, action settings, and rare earth magnet fingertips make this a worthwhile read.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|my 6 yr old asked me if he could have this game as it was free and he loves angry birds i agreed he could down load it , i wish i hadnt bothered it caused more problems than its worth he usually down loads any games he asks me for and if i agree he knows exactly what to do ,this time however he couldn't understand why it didn't appear in his library of angry birds games thats when the fun started ,and is still on going it just does not download its rubbish and as for the instructions from the amazon site is another bloody mystery what the hell are SPEED SETTINGS and where are they on my kindle fire HD i certainly couldn't find any such settings then you to SYNC with app WHY????

159463176X|3.0|I became one of his most loyal readers after falling in love with his first two novels The Kite Runner and A Athousand Splendid Suns. Mr. Hosseini set the bar very high with these two novels but was unable to meet my expectations with And The Mountains Echoed. The book is simply okay. I was a bit dissapointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really had a good time going through the levels. I wish there were more.<br />I would buy a full size version of this game.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|This is a good, raunchy movie for the teenage or college crowd. They loved it. I guess they liked the gift.
B00E6D4HHO|1.0|This set should contain 11 Blu-ray discs to ensure that fans and customers aren't short-changed.<br /><br />6 from the Trilogy<br />1 of X-men Origins Wolverine<br />1 of Xmen First class<br />3D / 2D disc of The Wolverine<br />1 Bonus Disc
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's amazing at first I thought oh this is going horrible and I will try it out but I guess it's the opposite
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I didn't enjoy this book as I did the others, it was slow and hard to get into.  Lots of unanswered questions, hopefully the next book answers them.
B004XZR63M|4.0|I purchased this for my kindle and although i haven't finished this book yet so far not only is it a good read, its practical as well. I see where i have to change my way of thinking.
B000002KGT|5.0|I got this. For my husband and it came promptly. The only thing I can say is that Amazon packed it with another item that is a good 30 pounds. I am not sure what the person was thinking who packed these together. I had purchased two different CDs one was smashed this one was fine.
B0011Z10PC|4.0|Would have given 5 stars but they combined some of my favorite songs so I can't play them individually. Oh well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is bananas and challenging when you have to do the vector and meena battles but that is why I have brothers this is the awesomest game ever
B000065V42|5.0|My family enjoys this movie and I was glad to be able to get it on DVD. It came promptly and in good condition.
1400052181|5.0|I absolutely detest nonfiction. It is boring, and crammed with facts to the point where I have to retread sentences several times to understand the overall message. However, for the first time ever, I found myself unable to put down a nonfiction book.<br />I was forced to read this book as a summer assignment. At first, I thought I wouldn't like it, as it was about science (which I love, but scientific nonfiction books are generally jam-packed with words I don't know), but as I began to read it, I realized it was completely different. Skloot does not rattle off endless useless facts, does not rattle on and on about her opinion (which honestly, I doubt many care about all too much) about the grand scheme of things, does not repeat the same argument over and over again, and does not bore me to death. For once, I picked up a nonfiction book written by an author who can truly write. Skloot weaves a story of Henrietta's life and death. She simply narrates what happened at times, adding additional facts and explanation when needed. The fact that she did not just focus on the scientific aspect of the story, but also on the disjustice served to Henrietta and her family, makes the story compelling and similar to a fiction book with very little dialogue and a little more fact that expected. Thoroughly recommended for nonfiction haters.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is the greatest app ever the kids especially love the adorable minions and it really brings the movie to life:)
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Received it promptly the only thing I can say is they packed it with another item that was huge and heavy and it pretty much smashed the cd in shipment. Amazon was nice enough to replace it in twenty four hours since it was a Father's Day gift. I was not impressed with whoever shipped this out. It worked out ok.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is agreat time waster and can be compared to the famous Subway Surfer. This game is worth your time, and could possibly be th  best free game I've played.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Took too long to download. Didn't even get a chance to play it. Started to take up too much space on my kindle fire.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|I got this app a while ago and was doing really well but recently when I went to play it froze while I was choosing the track then closed the app. It has done that since then. I downloaded it again and lost everything and it still doesn't work. I am really disappointed because I have to start all over and I can't play anymore.

B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Expendables 2 is not quite as good as the 1st.<br /><br />THE BAD & UGLIES<br />1. At times you were very aware you were watching a movie!<br /> I blame the editing- it did not flow like the 1st film meaning the magic was not there<br /><br />2. The action was campy, Plot was thin, and I would not look for it to win an Oscar, or even a VH-1 &#34;well you tried&#34; award.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />1.The action campy, plot thin, and it would not win an award if turned in as a high school project at a local film festival.<br />The movie is exactly what you would expect with this cast and sometimes matches the mood your in...we have all been there I don't want to think, I don't even really want to pay attention I just want action.<br /><br />2. Chuck Norris!<br /><br />the elf
B005DJREJS|4.0|I really enjoyed this show.  I've almost finished through season 3 in about 1 week's time.  So glad it was on Prime so I could learn about it.  I have a 13 year old daughter...I don't think I want her to watch it yet because it kind of glorifies sex with teens and some bad language, but what do you expect from an MTV show?  In a year or two, it might actually teach her some good lessons though.  As a parent and former teenage girl...love it :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Whether in a Silo or in the here and now, these thoughts,<br />experiences and ideas plague us all.<br /><br />How often inertia causes us to not even want to shower<br />or dress. How often does the feeling of power swell a<br />persons head until they start believing they are omnipotent?<br /><br />GREAT READ! So incredibly insightful!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the challenges, but would like to see the game changed so that after you beat a boss you don't have to keep fighting them over and over. Good game if you have patience and friends to gift you items.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|vary good where the good guy wins lots of killing and funny parts but was a bit long for some
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not dirty enough to be porn, not good enough to be, well, good, this book, all 526 pages was pure drudgery. I was so aware of the awful writing that it was impossible to get lost in the paper thin story line. If you want to read a good erotic trilogy, grab Anne Rice's Taking of Beauty series. And if you read Fifty Shades and want to graduate up to what the adults are reading, the Beauty trilogy is a step in the right direction.
B000058CAV|1.0|i like this movie!  I saw originally when it 1st came out but now it's  an Error message  that shows up!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This Is basic manning but fun . There are timed levels  and some higher levels. But good for coffee break  time and not boring or long.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Every episode is a 'cliffhanger!'  Glad my wife convinced me to buy the DVDs so I could catch-up . . . she has watched the first two seasons and Knew I would like the series.  Boy was she Right.  We are Not couch potatoes.  We are selective on TV viewing . . . cannot stand mindless comedy shows where every 20 seconds the 'canned laughter' kicks in . . . people don't laugh all day, everyday.  Can hardly wait for Season Two to arrive!
0738711500|5.0|The cards are of great size and color. Book that came with it is easy and of great help. Now it will be easy for me to do something I have wanted to do for a long time.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I'm watching it for the second time. I caught it in the beginning when it originally aired and now I'm watching it again and it doesn't disappoint. Gritty, even by today's standards. Acting is exceptional. They rarely make cop shows like this any more. Chiklis hasn't done anything this good since and he was SO great in it. Launched a few other careers as well. If you haven't seen it...give it a try. There's a reason it went so many seasons and how many shows can you say that about lately?
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This book was great! I really loved it. I've read Pride and Prejudice, and that one is good, also. But I like this one better.<br /><br />Mr. Knightley is an amazing character. So is Emma Woodhouse. It is a lovely English romance, and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.

B00821PCJS|4.0|I find Falling Skies interesting but not enthralling. The basic story line of Earth vs Aliens has been done many times and some certainly better. However, the difference here is that Steven Spielberg has us jump headfirst into this storyline after the aliens have already won. The cast does a nice job, Will Patton was the only name I really knew initially but the characters have grown on me over the first season. They do seem a bit calmer and braver than I might be in the same situation, and sometimes they go into some introspective moments that bring the pace of the story to a crawl. Overall though, the concept, the special effects, and the characters are interesting enough to keep me watching into season 2. Now to see how Tom gets back off that ship....
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works great.  I use it everyday.  Thank you.  I really love my Kindle and all the apps I can get.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|The Percy Jackson series contributed heavily into my writing today. The books always had a set amount of characters and a similar plot with some sort of twist to keep things interesting, a very fulfilling and easy read for twelve-year-old me. Even with the previous books in this series, the casts followed the same mold: three or so characters, the leader, the weirdo, the girl, go on a big quest.<br />This book is special because the casts merge, so now we have two leaders, two weirdos, two girls, and Annabeth, who is her own category now. What the book tries to do is make that work<br />Here's the point: if you're used to advanced books, this might disappoint you. Riordan made his bread on three man groups, not seven, so you never really see the seven working together.<br />I almost stopped reading near the end. it just kinda turned to noise. The ending itself was fine, it provides several challenges for the author, I hope they pay out in the next book<br />All-in-all. The book is fine for young adults, if you've been with the series so far, of course read it, if you've just joined this warriors of Olympus plot, and you're used to those complex, advanced books. The first two books are a fine stopping point, move this to the back of your reading list.

B00BK40QO0|5.0|I can't add anything substantial to the general praise lavished on this super=budget box set of Klemperer's EMI Mahler output, but newcomers may not be prepared for some of his eccentric tempos. The slowness of the first movement and finale of Sym. 7 is so extreme as to misrepresent what Mahler wrote. the three inner movements, however,hew closer to what we normally hear. Sym. 2 has no eccentricities. Sym. 4 has a first movement whose slowness requires some adjustment but nothing drastic. Sym. 9 is cumbersome in the second movement Landler, but otherwise what strikes me about Klemperer's reading is how square the rhythms are throughout.<br /><br />The metronome isn't a god critic, as the saying goes. More important is Klmeperer's general aversion or avoidance of Mahler's turbulent emotional extremes. He imposes his own stylistic grandeur and steadiness. How you respond to that will depend n each listener's taste. I would point out that the true glories of this collection are to be found in the vocal works - an incomparable Das Lied von der Erde that for me has never been equalled, and a miscellany of four Rucker Lieder and one Knaben Wunderhorn song that captures Christa Ludwig at her peak, artistically and vocally. She was able to forge memorable long-term partnerships with three great conductors - Bernstein, Karajan, and Klemperer - giving us magnificent Mahler with all of them.<br /><br />The remastered sound is as good as any issue of Klemperer's Mahler that I've ever heard, and the restoration of the Seventh Sym., long out of print and somewhat infamous as a performance, would make experienced collectors sit up and take notice.itch, the affected ones would stick out. A curious thing.<br /><br />that said, the sound here is as good as any issue of Klemperer's Mahler that I've ever heard, and the restoration of the Seventh Sym., long out of print and somewhat infamous as a performance, would make experienced collectors sit up and take notice.

B002YK8OKC|5.0|Every time I see this movie I laugh!  it is exceptionlly funny and the kids love it!  the story never gets old.
B006VREHRS|5.0|It makes you love history. I hope it is not too far from authentic. Season 1 introduces lovable rogues, like Nucky Thompson, who makes you love Steve Buscemi. Jimmy and Al Capone are endlessly fascinating people going from loving and sensitive to darkly violent.<br /><br />I love all the women. Margaret is cunning and I love her neighbor who thinks Margaret is a whore. The dress shop setting was wonderful. Paz De La Heurta is awesome.<br /><br />It's just very, very good television.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game if it cost money I don't care I would buy it best game ever played other than bella Sara
B00B81B0HC|3.0|I also recently discovered this group thanks to Pandora.  My wife and I really enjoy their music, and this album would be a 4/5 for me if there weren't the quality issues others have mentioned.  I seriously considered not buying this album, and future albums will be hard to purchase if they have the same issues (from any group).
B0052AC8C6|5.0|A great movie. Granted, there are some references that younger children are sure to miss, but all the better. A clever, creative film, and Johnny Depp is excellent as the leading lizard (and this from someone who by no means is a die-hard Depp fan). It made me laugh out loud on several occasions... which is no small feat. Loved it.

B008KOTNVA|4.0|The kit is well organized and has plenty of choices of bits for repairs and upgrades.<br /><br />The bits are of decent quality but are a bit fragile.  I chipped the corner off of one of the slotted screwdriver bits when I had a tight screw.  Not a huge deal as the other bits are similar in size, but you have to use regular tools if you have screws that are tight and difficult to remove.  Works fine one everything else.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Very grateful for this app, especially like the ability to control the resolution/quality when viewing online.  Ty for the great app devian studio!
B006CHML4I|4.0|I liked the case of the watch, both the front side and the back side. The back side of the watch is transparent so that you can see what's going on inside (of course you cannot see it when you are wearing it, but i still think that it is cool).<br />However, the watch band could be more decent. Considering this watch is a kind of sports watch, the band seems vulnerable and it is not so easy to wear/take off this watch. But it is definitely much better than the cheaper brands.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|really good. The game is awesome for play on the tablet.  I am very impressed with the game. really good for tablet
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I bought this for my niece today from Target and she loves it. No leaks straight from the box. She played in it for an hour and a half and wouldve kept playing if we didnt make her get out. She just kept going on the slide over and over again. She is about 3 months from 4 is in the 60th percentile in terms of weight and height for her age. I only wish the edge was a little longer so she could slide further. I havent tested out the sprinklers because we filled it up facing the wrong direction. Will update in a few weeks.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|Turning back armies of aliens and monsters with little more than a sonic screwdriver.<br /><br />The Doctor rivals the Jedi of the Star Wars franchise in pure coolness.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Surely by now in our year 2013, it's no secret to any film viewer, young or old that James Bond is one of the all-time favorite characters in cinema, the world over.  The 007 Franchise has graced us with a whopping 23 films over the years, while garnering an astronomically impressive profit that exceeds $11.5 billion in global revenue.<br /><br />The sleek and sexy British secret agent's films appeal to both men and women of all ages.  Men admire him because he's macho, sleeps with various women, and gets the job done with the added bonus of the occasional, not always overtly cheesy `one liner' here and there.  Women admire him for his gentle poise matched harmoniously with strong convictions for danger, succeeding and sex.  To sum him up in a bit of a redundant cliche; men want to be him; women want to be with him.<br /><br />My childhood is stuffed to its brim with memories of my grandparents (who were not particularly into film) showcasing for me on my weekly visits to their casa - syndicated re-runs of the Roger Moore era James Bond films, practically relentlessly (I've sense enjoyed quite immensely jumping on the Daniel Craig band wagon).  I was hooked.  Here was a man that had it all: a slew of sexy women here and there, the freedom to travel the globe, to take the lives of his enemies without facing repercussions, all whilst maintaining a lifestyle infused with a considerable income and an endless sense of adventure.  And he wasn't at all like the superheroes I had grown accustomed to.  He could sweep women off their feet, defeat the bad guys, thus saving the world, and sip a martini as if nothing had happened, all the while remaining 100 percent human, and hardly ever even losing his cool.  What a bad-ass!<br /><br />So it's no wonder, esteemed novelist and screenwriter, Damian Stevenson, took up an interest in divulging to us, the prestigious brains behind the operation, Sir Ian Fleming.  Stevenson's latest work, The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada is a stunning biography on the man who brought us the man, the myth, the legend, that is... James Bond.<br /><br />Reading this piece, it's not hard to see where Ian Fleming found the inspiration to birth the character of James Bond.  You see, he's not too far off from the stellar chap himself!  This book reveals the edgy and daunting past of Ian Fleming as a young agent at the brink of World War II.  My research tells me this story is 100 percent accurate to the truth, which is simply put, downright astonishing.  The story has all the elements that make any good Bond film worth watching: espionage, sex, action, violence, suspense, drinking, smoking, delicately and tastefully pervaded bits of humor here and there, and of course, the incredible imaginings of what it must be like to be a secret spy, all shared with its audience intimately.<br /><br />I've not yet read any of the Fleming novels (there are 16 James Bond novels in total) but after reading Stevenson's work, I'm beyond enthralled with doing so.  Here is a formula of storytelling that is every bit as exhilarating on the page as it is on the screen.  We're brought into the mind of a spy; thrust into his thoughts and his heart as his most personal thoughts are shared with us in moments of shocking suspense and intrigue.  I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end, thirsting for where the story would take me next, with young Commander Fleming at his helm.<br /><br />It was nearly impossible to not think of Fleming as James Bond which I found to be invigorating!  Sitting there, thinking of what must have been going through Fleming's mind when he is plunged into the situations he faces within his unbelievably incredible tale.  It must have been effortless for him to later reflect on the events, picturing them as not only cinematic, but as an overall upright story worth telling.  The adrenaline is always there, on every page as he finds himself in sticky situation after muggy circumstance.<br /><br />He talkslike James Bond, moves like James Bond, thinks like James Bond and feels as James Bond.  My favorite element was learning what Fleming was discerning during each story beat.  The way he studies people he interacts with and how he judges them.  There is one moment in the book that stands out, where Fleming is sharing his thoughts with us of what he thinks of a mistress of his, and you can just see where James Bond's free spirited take on sex and relationships formulates from.  You can hear Bond's sarcastic tone when he's in the presence of a commanding officer and you can picture the smirk that must be on his face, that makes James Bond so stylistic and, let's just say it... ballsey.<br /><br />It's impossible to read this tale and not be inspired, moved and absolutely titillated.  Stevenson writes with the seamless balance of dedicated research, humor, wit and imaginative elegance all the while, painting a majestic picture in the reader's mind of what he wants you to see, feel, and ultimately experience.  It's lean, straight to the point, and never disappoints.  If you're looking for a thrilling read on espionage that won't bore you to death and take you months to finish, then you've come to the right place.  You'll want to run out and watch a Bond film or two immediately upon finishing it.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the perfect solution for keeping track of everything. Efficiently syncs among all of my devices and sharing feature allows me and my wife to access same notes. It is now indispensable for our busy lives!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game it's so much fun and my kids love it also. The minions are so cute. Everyone should try it.
1616614609|5.0|Very well made, very fun.  More than just 2 decks to play, so there's already hours of fun to be had in this set.
034580404X|5.0|I am on my 8th reading of the trilogy! Really hoping she writes a fourth. If I could say one thing to people who have not read it because they think its just about the sex. I was pleasantly surprised with the love story around the whole set. I could not put it down and am still reading it. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I want to play this game so bad! But sadly I can't. Won't work on kindle fire. My minion only runs a few steps and just freezes. Please fix and I'll try again.
B00BXI26XC|2.0|This is pretty neat. But my friend has this on his phone and it has this cool cockpit view, which I can not seem to find on the Kindle addition
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Very good show, you have to pay close attention so that you can keep up with different names and how they relate to other characters.. I like how all the plots come together.. Worth the money and can't wait until February for the release of season 3 so I can watch season 1,2 and 3 all over again to get prepared for season 4 in march!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I missed so many episodes of this show while it was still on the air! I love catching up though, and it still holds up very well with regards to special effects, unlike some of the other shows from around that time.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I purchased the deluxe edition and felt it was worth the price. For a few more dollars than the original, you get some cool pins, a patch, and a sticker, cd with extra live tracks with a nice box to hold it all in.<br /><br />I also purchased the vinyl and it came with a cd of the album. Needless to say the vinyl sounded awesome on my turntable.<br /><br />If you're a fan of what Queensryche were, then you must buy this cd/mp3/vinyl because we need to support these guys. Even though Geoff isn't in the band, it could explain why they were making crappy albums.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I just love this movie.  Getting ready to watch it again.  And don't forget the bonus at the end is so worth watching, lot of surprises.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I am enjoying being a part of the &#34;kitchen house&#34;. The book keeps my interest and was a good pick for one of my summer reads.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is beautifully written and the acting and casting is wonderful. You get to know and love each character with all their flaws and insecurities. Life was so much harder and yet simpler during this time in history.  Values, family, hard work and community were necessary to just make it through another day. These are values we should all have and standards we should live by. I highly recommend this series.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|One can just listen to this over and over and over.  How exciting to encounter a superb new composer, at least to me.  Mike Dixon and the London Philharmonic do it proud, but Tony Banks stands out as an exceptional and exceptionally entertaining talent.  Seven - a terrific set of music.  Each piece from Spring through the Ram to Gravity stands on it's own and yet they come together to create a most enjoyable suite.  Really nicely done.  I'll be recommending this to the local Symphony.  It is exciting to run into this kind of new talent.  The suite does call to mind 'Finlandia' to a degree.  It is certainly every bit as enchanting.
B000E97X66|5.0|Always been a fan of Springsteen's early work. And this one of his best. The band was tight and the crowd knew when applaud. Great CD.
B000HT3Q3M|3.0|Two terrific talents but they didn't click enough to get up to either one's normal level of performance.  Was hoping for more.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written and very interesting commentary on the human side of war.  That it is true makes it all the more special.
B000P6XU5G|5.0|One of my favorite all-time westerns; great rapport between Angie Dickenson and John Wayne, rest of cast is first rate!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Okay so both my daughters love this CD and I have to admit, I don't hate it, despite not being TS's biggest fan.  Quite a few songs are enjoyable!
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Tom Cruise's real life weirdness aside, I think he is a good actor.  He is well suited for this film. While some of the story drags a bit sappy, the film is very interesting as a whole and especially worthwhile visually.  It warrants a big screen/HD viewing.  I enjoyed the references to past sci fi flics.  Anyone that thinks the scenes are a \\"rip off\\" doesn't understand homage. They were about respect of the genre and fun to spy for those who know the references. The overall story may feel like it has holes but this film is very good because it is one to reflect upon.  In doing so, you can figure out why things were the way they were and that the holes were not as much as your initially thought.  The pacing of the film was good too- not overloaded with action like big budget bozo films, and not too hung up on slow story/character development.  It was a really good mix that, for me, now puts this film up there with my sci fi faves. [I would have liked to give it a 4 and half star rating]  By the way, in a small way Oblivion reminded me of an even better recent sci fi film- \\"District 9\\".  They're no where near the same in story, but both are finally some contemporary sci fi that balances thinking and action.

B00005T7I1|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I really like the comic book-like effect that it has. Parts of the movie appear to be almost in black and white but with very vivid colors. It's awesome. I watched this movie several times after I got the DVD. The vivid colors in the dark landscape give this movie a dream like effect to me.

B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I have been a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan for several years. When I heard that a movie was being made I was thrilled! When I heard Tom Cruise had the lead... Not so much. I realize Tom bought the rights to the book. If not for him the movie wouldn't have been made at all.<br /><br />It was actually pretty good. Very good, if you can forget that Jack is 6'5\\". Due to camera angles, shoe lifts, boxes, whatever was used, Tom appears to be at least the same height as the other actors.<br /><br />The action is great. Kick-ass, beat-em-up and don't take names kind of action. Jack is not just brawn he is brains too. That comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />The movie was a little disjointed at times. Hard to keep everything straight. If you want popcorn, get it before the movie starts. If you wait you will be lost.<br /><br />If Tom makes another Reacher movie I will buy that one too. I like action films. I guess, sometimes, size doesn't matter after all.  ;)
0307719774|5.0|trying to get some groove and spark back into ME, I purchased this. trying to journal can be hard to start and even harder to fin time and clarify your mind! this simple journal poses ONE question a day, giving you very few lines to answer. it causes you to think and jot down a brief answer. don't overanalyze! what's cool is that it's for 5 years and i'm eager to see how in the next five years, how all my responses will either change or differ! reaalllllly cool and easy inspiration for the self.

She works in the UK biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, and for the past seven years has specialized in epigenetics.  She has strong relationships with leading epigenetics researchers, with medical labs in Europe, and with some of the most prestigious institutions in the US (such as the Harvard Medical School).<br /><br />A human being is the product of an amazing interaction between the genes inherited from one's parents (genetics) and all the modifications that one's lifestyle imposes on those genes (**epigenetics).<br /><br />Epigenetic modifications do not affect our genetic code but do affect the molecular mechanisms that regulate the genetic code's expression.<br /><br />This is where this book comes in.  It takes us on a scientific tour of what's known about epigenetic mechanisms and their implications especially for disease and aging.<br /><br />Near the end of this book there is a chapter on plants and their \\"highly developed epigenetic system.\\"  Another final chapter explains the honeybee and epigenetics.<br /><br />Carey concludes with a discussion of the future directions for epigenetics research and its ability to improve human health.<br /><br />I appreciated the excellent illustrations peppered throughout this book to help me understand important concepts.  As well, there is a glossary that I found to be invaluable.<br /><br />Finally, it would be helpful to have some basic biology before reading this book.  Also, I found it best to read this book slowly so as to get maximum understanding from it.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good, solid introduction to the fascinating world of epigenetics. Welcome to the revolution!!<br /><br />(first published 2012;  acknowledgements;  introduction; 16 chapters;  main narrative 310 pages;  notes;  glossary;  index)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXasic biology before reading this book.

B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game on the go.. addictive and fun. Great adaptation of classic game thanks for sharing. Okay to be a good time.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Watched when it first aired and then lost track.  Getting back into it has been fun!  Sad that Cory is gone now, though.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|There is obviously not enough serious dramatic work for these wonderful actors, yet they have bills to pay. Very lazy screen play with warmed over plot lines and stunts.<br />Only for die hard fans of Bruce Willis.
044024613X|4.0|***DISCLAIMER: Not much of the plot is revealed in this review, but if you are like me and do not want even the slightest hint of a spoiler tainting your reading experience, then do not read this!<br /><br />This book was a page-turner, but more in the sense that I wanted to keep reading to confirm my predictions rather than to be blown away by an unexpected plot twist (which does eventually come at the very end). None of the main characters were particularly likable in my opinion, but I didn't think they were supposed to be, least of all Jacob, whose actions and traits are being questioned in the story and by the reader himself/herself as the plot progresses. You are left to ponder a lot of interesting themes that the author has intentionally planted (i.e. the legal system, nature vs. nurture, the degree of privacy in a parent-child relationship, the permanency of what happens on the Internet, etc.), but what I found myself thinking about the most was whether or not Jacob had actually committed either of the crimes in which he was accused. I'm not sure if that was left open to interpretation on Landay's part or if I'm just being ignorant, but I believed that in both cases there was simply not enough evidence to rightly convict Jacob, even if his family history and behavior suggests that it was possible. When I discussed it with my mother, she believed without a doubt that Jacob was guilty in both situations. So my final statement is that if Landay intentionally left Jacob's true actions ambiguous, then I praise him for writing an unconventional crime thriller that I would recommend. However, if there was supposed to be some cut-and-dry situation, then I clearly missed it and believe that it should have been better explained.<br /><br />Also, side note: I think Landay could have done a lot more with the narrator's father's character, because his dialogue, even though it was by no means supposed to be Shakespearean, seemed pretty underdeveloped to the point of beingalmost comical and added in as an afterthought despite the important role he plays in the story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the show, they became my TV family and when they had joy we had joy and when they became sad we became sad. Can hardy wait for the new season.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This was downloaded for an eight year old and she says: It was just a demo, and not a game
B0028KF4M4|4.0|Season three was good. It keep me wondering how he would get out certain situations where he would be either caught or killed, and it was worked out smoothly and not a &#34;get the hell out of here that's impossible&#34; type of situation.

0671800183|3.0|old book but still for the price I cannot complain.  I can not think of ten more words stupid stupid stupid
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This app is ok. However it's rather slow paced and you do much of the same thing. It's also rather addicting. There are times when this game can actually be fun but for someone my age I rather go with a game with a little more challenge.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I am very pleased.  I do wish it would take the pictures faster between charging. Thank you...I am fairly pleased.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|I didn't realize when this movie was made, Hollywood was at its greatest between New technologies and special effects. Any way this movie brings me back to the good ole days.. I havn't seen a good movie come out of Hollywood for years..<br />and of course Arnold was also in his prime..  a great era..
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It was awesome.  I love the bag.  It is totally everything I thought it would be.  GREAT BAG.  THANK YOU!!!!

B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I thought it would be boring because it was a summer reading book but it was very good. A little confused a time though
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie kept my attention.  At times I forgot I was watching a movie.  The character development was good and the main characters  were very charismatic.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I liked the original story and so I was still able to enjoy a twist on the first story.  I think it may be more enjoyable for those who have not seen any of the previous versions.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I normally don't write reviews for anything, but this thing is really neat. I bought it to use in my bedroom and my daughters room. In the living room, I have my PS3, so I can watch Netflix on that TV, but other than that, I just have my laptop. I have connected my laptop to my bedroom TV through the HDMI port, but it's too much work, and I have to use a wireless mouse to control the laptop...it's a big hassle. With the chrome cast, I can quickly and easily move it from my room to my daughters room and use my phone to control it. Just tried it out and the quality looks great. As soon as I plugged it into my TV, the setup screen came up. It was just a quick download, and it pretty much sets itself up to connect to your wireless. I downloaded chrome cast and Netflix to my phone, but I haven't tried casting a video yet.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I liked the message of this film.  Kids seemed to like it too and they definitely understood the message.  It was funny and that was the best part.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has beautiful photography, compelling story, exquisite costumes. The acting is quite  superb. I hope this series continues forever!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I liked it a lot.  I would have loved it more if it had a happy ending although I understand that this does not always have the impact the author would want.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a good read for all adult ages regardless of their current health. I plan to personally follow the dietary advice in this book.
0375826742|5.0|This book was very entertaining and i loved it. I loved the covers that the book has and i loved the condition that it came in. I would definitely buy another book from amazon.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Hard to get onto but when you do it is a can't put it down book.  Good for a long winter day read.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Amazing description of an amazing man about whom I knew so little. I am happy to have<br />learned about him and and about the role of imagination in his life and in the life of genius in general.<br />This book. Is worth reading and you will be amazed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I actually ordered a Chromecast the day it was announced from Google. However the next day, I was told that they were available for purchase at bestbuy. I was anxious to try it out so I went and bought another one and gave it a try.<br /><br />Setup was easy and within 5 minutes, I was watching a youtube video on my 65\\" TV. The quality was VERY good. I tried a 1080p video first \\"Big Buck Bunny\\" and it looked, played and sounded wonderful. Next, was playing music from my Google Play music app. Same result, the music sounded great.<br /><br />I moved on to my Macbook Pro, and again, the videos was clear, without lag, no audio sync problems at all. Same for my Windows PC.<br /><br />Those considering buying the Chromecast  should consider what the Chromecast actually is and does, instead of what they wish it could do. So here are some facts:<br /><br />1. The Chromecast is not a streaming device of local digital content. In other words, it does NOT play digital music and videos that is stored locally on your network drives or computers. However there is a work-around for this:<br /><br />Use PLEX Media Server. If you don't already have it, here's the link:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Once you download it and point it to your files,it will act as a proxy and allow your music and videos to be played on your HDTV using the Chromecast through the Chrome browser. Simply launch the PLEX Media Manager in Google Chrome browser. Pick a file to play, Hit the Google Cast button and you'll get seamless playback of your own files. [Edit: Please see comments to see an alternative method].<br /><br />2. The Chromecast is not a DLNA or Miracast device or Apple's airplay. This is a lot like my number 1 fact, but I wanted to make this clear. If you want device mirroring (display whatever is on the device's screen), the Chromecast, is NOT for you. The video and music does NOT stream from the controller device (Your computer, tablet, smartphone). Chromecast works by fetching the content from a website or cloud service itself, NOT from the device you're using. Here's what's cool about that:<br /><br />A. You could start playing a video using your smartphone,tablet,computer as a \\"remote\\" and still be able to browse the web, play a game, check your social apps, write a book report, put the device to sleep,turn the device completely off (I tried this myself), or leave the house, and the video WILL still play without issues.<br /><br />B. Your battery life is saved! Because your phone, tablet or computer (not plugged in)is not actually streaming to the Chromecast, your battery consumption is minimal. You could Play dozens of movies over several days and still have most of your battery life remaining (Of course this would depend on what else you do with the phone, tablet or computer and how long your device can stay in standby).<br /><br />C. Every device connected to the Chromecast on the same network can take control of playback, adding to the queue (what's going to play next). Pause, fast forward, rewind, etc. So if your roommate, friend, parent, sibling, spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend has to leave with their device, you don't have to worry.<br /><br />D. You can play content from thousands upon thousands of sources using your computer. Using Google Chrome, nearly every webpage, that has content can be viewed using Chromecast. Of Course, this depends what protocols the site is using. If the site has trouble playing on your computer, then it probably won't work well on the Chromecast, either.<br /><br />3. Chromecast IS cross platform (works with multiple devices). As I said, I tried it with several devices with different operating systems. At the time of this review, it works on Windows PC's, Macbooks, and android devices. The app for iOS devices is coming soon. Everyone knows the Apple App store has stringent policies and at times, it can be a long process. Look at the Onlive game streaming app. We won't get into how Apple has been trying to eradicate google applications from it's ecosystem anyway. I'm sure the app is waiting for approval. Just be patient. [Edit: Please see comments for a reply to it working on iOS devices].<br /><br />There are several youtube videos that can show you how to set it up or how well it works. I made a video myself:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Watching my video isn't required, but it does help to verify what I'm saying.<br /><br />4. The device you use with the Chromecast, must be on the same WIFI network. The important word here is WIFI. If you are trying to use it, with a ethernet (wired) connected device, even though it's on the same network, it will NOT work! Yes, that sucks, but not being able to use sink water in your gas tank, kind of sucks to. If that's a deal breaker for you, then you shouldn't purchase it. It's how they chose to implement it's use. It is, what it is. [Edit: Please see comment section].<br /><br />5. The Netflix 3 months free limited time offer is over! I received 3 months free with both my purchases. I live in the eastern time zone. Even though I bought my second Chromecast on July 25th at 6:46pm. I realize that when the offer was no longer available, it should have been posted immediately so that consumers could factor that into their decision to buy the Chromecast. Instead of calling it a limited time offer, they should have said \\"while supplies last.\\" Never the less, the features and functionality of this device has nothing to do with the inadequacy of a bonus offer. To help people make a decision about a future purchase and if it will work for THEM in the home configuration they have, is paramount in my book.<br /><br />6. The Chromecast REQUIRES power through USB connection or from your wall outlet. The required peripherals ARE provided to you in the retail box. Some people are saying if you have an HDMI 1.4 compatible port on the back of your TV, the device can be powered by the HDMI port alone, without the USB cord connected. I CANNOT speak to that,as my HDMI ports did NOT power the Chromecast. I had to use the provided USB wire and connect it to a USB port available on the back of my TV.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the purchase. I've read some of the other reviews, particularly the 1 and 2 star reviews, because it's an indicator of what can possibly go wrong with the device. I would suggest that people make their decision based on people that have actually bought the device and have experience connecting, setting it up and ACTUALLY using the device. Most of the bad reviews are from people that have not used it, didn't understand the features of the device, or, to be honest, has a problem with the competition between Apple and Google and wants to dismiss this product because of their affinity for Apple products. Look at the features and functions of this device and consider them for yourself.<br /><br />I hope this review helps someone who may be considering this device.<br /><br />EDIT: Recently more apps were added with chromecast support, including the PLEX app! Other editions are: HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Pandora, Vevo, Redbull.tv, Songza, Post TV, Viki, Real Player Cloud.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I'm a new Kindle user, but Weather Channel was one of the first apps I loaded.  I haven't used the new version very much.....don't like it.  Liked the old version better.  Thought maybe it was just me, but I see that I'm not alone.  Harder to maneuver.  Don't care for the new map which is w h at I used the most.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Each level gets harder and help you makes your brain thinkI love it!!!  It's very interesting and make you think!!I recommend this game!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a challenging game.  Getting past ads with each game is a small aggregation but its free right.  My only complaint now is that won't open claiming I'm not logged into Amazon Aps.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Reacher is a man's man and could care less about political correctness!! He has no fear and I love it when he  takes on<br />bullies unarmed and leaves 'em broken, bloody and stacked in a corner or all over the floor..This is one of best I've read.<br />Every page is packed with action and exciitement.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Seeing as how I cannot find any box sets from the US, this UK set is great. Some have said these are pirated copies, but that is nonsense. The only problem I have experienced is the pilot episode was grainy in spots, and one of the extras had a similar but minor problem. Every disc plays with no issues, and the picture is great, and the labels are spot on. Take it from someone who as over a thousand Blu Rays and 5000 DVDs. For the price I paid, $70.00 US, I am very happy with this set. I got mine from Rockokma Media. And that is no BAZINGA.
0783219695|5.0|Ron Howard is at it once again.  His adaptation of Apollo 13 is genius.  This is definitely a good family movie or a movie to be seen by yourself.  I know they probably added a few things to jazz the movie up a little bit, but who doesn't do that when making a movie from a true story.  This movie is a must own by everybody or at least seen by everybody.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|it sucks when you run out of coins. I haven't played in two days and only got four coins. it really is annoying because I cant really enjoy the game. and I refuse to buy coins when not enough are given.
6305311463|5.0|Armageddon is easily one of my favorite movies to this day.  You just can't go wrong with an All-Star cast like this.  This has everything a great movie should with great action, comedy, and a good love story.  I bought the Blu-ray copy as well, but am a little bummed because the Criterion Collection has a few more added scenes I like seeing when watching it.  I absolutely love all the characters in this.  I recommend this to everybody all ages.
B00BHUB11Y|1.0|I did not know I was ordering this to be viewed by my personal computer. I wanted it sent in the mail to be given to my great nephew. I have no use for it and I don't even know how to watch it, if I wanted to.  My mistake I guess but not what I intended.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is a definite must own by everybody.  The younger generation of today might not like it as much, but that's okay.  If you're looking for good old classic coming of age movies or like the best old comedians then I highly recommend this movie to anybody along with Revenge of the Nerds with Anthony Edwards.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Fantastic location for a movie setting. Great story line and a cast of kids that can act. It is one of my favorite movies I enjoy watching over and over again.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|This movie got a lot of hype. For all that, the plot was weak and the eye candy wasn't all that either. Most of the way through the film, I was still waiting for it to get going. Watch it if it is free, but do not pay for it.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I love to watch Robert Downey Jr. He is an amazing actor.  Enjoyed this movie very much. Would recommend it.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|This is IMHO the best yet of the X-men movies. The action is about the same, but the story and characters seem to be better developed. The fun anachronisms of being set in the early 1960s add some interesting elements to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! Its not buggy and has almost no annoying ads. Its a must have item for long car rides or just hanging out at home. Anyway, love the app!
B0073PQ720|4.0|This is a really compelling movie. It was not all that widely marketed, so some people may not have noticed it.<br /><br />It was also the subject of a weird lawsuit, where some idiot lady sued the producers because it wasn't as much of a shallow action flick as the trailer lead her to believe. I guess too many big words and not enough explosions for her :) I view that as a feature, that this is in fact not a shallow action flick, but actually a somewhat deeper action flick :) if you will, in that it is an action crime drama, but with actually well-developed plot and characters that are interesting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel app is perfect. It is my favorite Internet app. It has everything I need or want in weather information. LOVE IT!
B006IND5M8|3.0|This movie is disappointing. Cowboys, action, space aliens, Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, it *should* have been great. But it's not; the story is stupid, and the action doesn't really make up for it.<br /><br />Watch it for free if you have spare time and want some candy, but don't pay for it, and don't have any great expectations.
0062255657|5.0|This is a lovely story of childhood fantasies with overtones of evil told as a flashback by the protagonist as an adult suddenly remembering something that had been slumbering in his subconscious since the events happened to him.  The story told from the child's perspective is thoroughly convincing and engaging from the start.  Gaiman's prose is sparse, but beautiful.  The fantastic elements in the story seem logical, thus he forces the reader to imagine and feel the events as they occur by not over explaining.  I felt drawn into the events rather than being an outside observer.  In this story, Gaiman explores the subjects of the loneliness of being an outsider, the parental rejection of the protagonist for not meeting the father's expectations of a male child, the wonder of finding a friend who accepts the other person as he is, the resilience of children, and power of their imagination and unconditional acceptance of the supernatural without question.  He also incorporates the concept that thoughtless actions sometimes result in unexpected and tragic consequences.  But in its totality, it is a celebration of childhood even in dark times and of the beauty of friendship.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I enjoy playing this game except when I run out of lives. I don't want to buy lives and pay more so I wait until I get more lives. Otherwise it's a fun game.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|If you don't like jazz you  WON'T love this DVD...grab it while you can a must have for the Simon Phillips fan!!!
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|Unless you've never picked up a guide book to Europe, don't bother.  Despite being free, it just didn't add anything.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I can't stop listening to this album! It has some upbeat songs that I enjoy listening to during my drive to and from work.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Hosseini is a good story teller.  I  don't think it measures up to Kite Runner but it still is an interesting read.  I would certainly recommend I.

B009ZW9DU2|5.0|It was well a well written and touching story. I strongly believe in the therapeutic healing power of  certain pets.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series of five are must reads for any Hobbit or Harry Potter fan.  It is too bad that HBO made this a series, it would have been a riveting movies series.  I can't remember when I have enjoyed reading a series more!!!!

B0026O475M|5.0|Great seller with fast delivery.<br /><br />If you are man-vs-nature movie lover, this is the BEST!!!  However, it will make you want to buy a volleyball in the event you need a best friend.  (Buy it..watch it..enjoy it!)

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino hasn't slowed down a bit in his movie productions!  Ever since the 90's his work just keeps getting better and better.  Plus he always has the best cast around to bring his words to life.  My only complaint is that a few days after I received this from Amazon, I saw a steelbook version at Target.  But I think the special features and extras are the same in both versions, so there's no need to worry.<br /><br />Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much I love it more than any thing. its the best app I have ever played it so fun.
B000SEI230|5.0|I've seen the movie a thousand times, and although I know the major plotline, it still brought me to tears. Much is different from the movie but still a great love story!
B00319ECGK|5.0|The best delivery service and one of the best films ever made. Shame the sequels sucked, but the first one was revolutionary. Keanu never better.

B002LVUKIS|5.0|This is amazing it one of the best gaming series of all time. But why did I only hear about it just yesterday. Well they are making a new one. Thief. For all the gamers who stuck to this series. There's a new one. With better graphics and gameplay. It's like nothing we've seen before. It's better than all the newer games.It can be the best it can be. I hope this was helpful.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Poltergeist (1982) meets The Exorcist (1973) in this modern horror classic that only fails to meet perfection because its predecessors already claimed the title by pioneering the scenes and atmosphere that form modern horror filmmaking dogma as we know it today.  But James Wan kicks up the competition and demonstrates his mastery of storytelling and character development in a genre that normally relies entirely on atmosphere and gore-slathered effects to fill seats.<br /><br />Let's just start by saying that this wasn't just a great horror movie.  This was a solid film and a horror movie based on a true account of Ed and Lorraine Warren's case with the Perron family in the 1970s.  There were loads of scares and--while, yes, they were often \\"jump scares\\"--the creepy tension-building on the approach was finely crafted.  You would know that \\"something\\" was about to happen and it was going to be scary, but it would still manage to catch you off guard, and you wouldn't feel that the scare was \\"cheap.\\"  Already this film has rightly stepped away from the last several dozen theatrical horror releases by engaging viewers with more than just funny satirical demons and loud noises masquerading as scary things.<br /><br />Director James Wan's (Insidious, Saw) film is consistent and smart, feeding viewers a steady and even diet of story and character development for both our haunted family and the paranormal investigators.  Instead of taking the first twenty minutes to introduce us to the characters and hope that we invest ourselves enough to care when their lives are threatened, Wan piece by piece reveals the nature of the Perron family, their house and the paranormalists who come to their aid.<br /><br />Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lily Taylor) have just moved their five daughters into a secluded house in Rhode Island and, as we've come to expect in horror movies, all horror movie houses come with a dark past.  Upon realizing that their troubles eclipsed the simplicity of a sleepwalking daughter and the stress of adapting to a new home, the Perrons seek help from Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), two married paranormal researchers with an impressive r&eacute;sum&eacute;  when it comes to purging evil.<br /><br />The big success in storytelling and direction here is that because Wan presented the Warrens to us in the opening scenes--to set the tone and show us how these paranormal investigators work--and fairly alternated between their college lecture circuit and the escalating situation in the Perron house before the two couples had met.  We weren't force fed some ghost hunters halfway through the movie (or later) who we are \\"supposed to like.\\"  Instead, we've already met them and learned that they're not some spirit hunting hacks who \\"hope\\" to find ghosts and get evidence so they can be taken seriously.  They hope there \\"aren't\\" ghosts, they're not in it for the money or fame, and they just want to help people (with an understandably fearful reluctance) utilizing their strange gifts.<br /><br />Score one for character development and great direction in a horror film, James Wan!<br /><br />Following in the obvious footsteps of Poltergeist (1982) and The Exorcist (1973), we are met with some very familiar scenes.  However, I felt this was a respectful nod executed with a succinct sense of urgency rather than simply riding coattails and milking past horror axioms for all they're worth.  The Conjuring skips most of the \\"are they just nuts\\" skepticism that would normally dominate the first half of a movie like this and gets right to dealing with the problem in a surprisingly practical manner.  As a result, most horror moviegoers' maddening frustrations are avoided in this film; no one does anything dumb or too perfectly right, the characters develop to protect their own and don't turn into sudden superhero evil-slaying experts over night, they don't walk into any traps when they should've known better, there are no ridiculous \\"Antichrist baby-Hell on Earth-chosen one-omen-gypsy curse-ancient relic-house built over sacred burial ground and angering the spirits\\" reasons justifying the spirit or what it wants or why it chose them, and they even address why the Perron family doesn't leave the house and if it would make a difference at all if they did.  All of this is done with simple explanation and for good reasons.<br /><br />Score for the writers!  By the way, the same writers (the Hayes brothers) will be doing the already announced sequel The Conjuring 2!!!  However I have not found anything indicating Wan's involvement.<br /><br />As we slowly relax our muscles between creepy tension, scares, \\"wait is there more?\\" and then the next creepy tension, we wade through some shocking imagery, disturbing shots, a little bit of brief gross stuff (but nothing truly gastro-intestinally gruesome and gore-slathered as we find in Tucker and Dale vs Evil, The Cabin in the Woods, Drag Me to Hell or Evil Dead) and eerie sounds.  Then there's the perfect--PERFECT--atmosphere that Wan spins.  Only with this paramount atmosphere could a small child staring into her dark bedroom corner (as we view nothing but out of focus \\"black\\") be as terrifying as the most horrible monster leaping from behind a corner drooling all manner of evil yuck.<br /><br />As most horror is rushed and features a slapped together story-and-victims-sandwich as a vehicle to shock us with cringing brutality, creature make-up and buckets of rubber guts, Wan demonstrates a mature and tactful restraint which, contrary to most horror filmmakers' training, is wildly successful and eclipses most horror of the last two decades!  Even Wan's shot transitions were thoughtfully discomforting and artistic.<br /><br />The Conjuring is rated R rating but actually seems less scary and intense than Poltergeist (1982)--of course, Poltergeist was WAY scary and I'd keep the kids over 14 to watch it!  I mean, it is scary--very scary.  But the gore is by no means a highlight and I didn't even notice the profanity (whatever there was).  All I noticed was that I was never bored or \\"waiting\\" for something cool to happen.  I was immersed and loved every minute of this modern classic horror.ridiculous \\"Antichrist baby-Hell on Earth-chosen one-omen-gypsy curse-ancient relic-house built over sacred burial ground and angering the spirits\\" reasons justifying the spirit or what it wants or why it chose them, and they even address why the Perron family doesn't leave the house and if it would make a difference at all if they did.

B000FC1336|1.0|The first two books from  Patrick were outstanding. I was extremely disappointed with unseen and Nimitz class. One Iraqi outsmarting the entire US Navy?? Just not good reading!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Wonderful book! Very in depth and descriptive. A lot going on. Will be a very good series. The hbo series follows the books exactly as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was the most awsome game that I have played in a long long time its fun like really fun hahahah yeah fun
B000062XGF|4.0|First, I and my wife are Sean Connery fans.I really enjoyed this movie because the combination of a very good story line with action and acting cannot be beat. I had recently saw it on tv and realized that I needed to add this to my dvd collection of over 1400 movies.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was very entertaining.  I can't wait to play more.  Both my grandson and myself played it for hours competing to find the next clue.  The details and each and every little step was amazing.  It was easy to lose track of time while playing.  Want more!!!
B004S5FVJS|4.0|It bought to conclusion several situations from the previous book and still left questions to be answered in the future so I will read on. Annie
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi grew up with a hard past and she grew out of it. I personally think that Demi, really, really, opened up about it in this album. I've been in the supportive side for Demi ever since Camp Rock, when I first heard her sing. If you listen to some of her older music, then her newer music, you can tell how her voice and her herself have grown. I am a proud lovatic. She is an amazing idol to have.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|I've had this game for a few months now, and I'm addicted! I love leveling up my dinos and decorating my park. When I find new amber, I'm always so excited to see what the next dinosaur is. The glacial add-on is pretty cool too, I mean, who wouldn't want a wooly mammoth or a smilidon?? The only thing I could say bad about it, is that you can't have more than one dino. What if I wanted 5 triceratops?? Anyways, this game is addictive, fun, and the best part, it's free!
B009C7JS14|5.0|Just what I was looking for. It is current and pretty and I can not wait to upgrade to the full version
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book can't wait to read the next one in the series. couldn't stop reading finished it in just a few days
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wonderfully put together. Recommend it to any and all readers, even if you are not usually a reader of fantasy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked on this series!The acting is superb and so is the dialogue! I will continue to view it online or on tv.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was pretty impressed!  Very limited ads for a freebie.  Just enough of a challenge that I had to resort to a cheat ...... okay, maybe a couple.  But not so much that I got too frustrated to want to finish.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I purchased this app about a week before it was the FAOD. I had read mixed reviews, but have always loved Kakuro, so I thought I'd give Kakuro HD a try. I'm really glad I did! I've played the game on both my Kindle HD as well as on my Samsung devices, and it plays beautifully on all of them. The graphics are large and easy to see, which is refreshing because I think there are too many apps with too small of graphics and text, which makes it difficult to play the game. Not so with this one. Everything is crystal clear and very readable. The game isn't laggy and functions well. It is also very user friendly. The only thing I would change is that I should have waited a week to purchase it, so I would have gotten it for free!  :) Even so, it has been well worth the $2.99 that I paid for it.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Well this is everything it is supposed to be...does take a little practice to get good at it but that is to be expected.
B00DNLXDUW|4.0|Have only had it a week or so so rating it at this point is premature. So far I like it.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|Yes somehow I listen to this one day in, day out. Like those bros. are tapped into some kind of inert inner dude machinations. So crafty. What math(s)?!?!?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a heartwarming story told from the perspectives of those who were touched by Auggie. Recommended for parents, teachers, and school-aged students (grades 4 up), to remind that a little extra kindness goes a long way.
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|Took me about an hour to figure out what I was doing.  Not a bad game but very tedious.  No real action except watching which star of yours the enemy is targeting and pushing a button to get more of your troops there.  It was okay but not enough to keep my attention.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Interesting, compelling, it will grab you. a lot of action, many twists and turns, i recommend it to any one
B00C7JFIRC|2.0|I looked forward to watching this movie because I thought an explanation of what preceded The Wizard Of Oz would tell the whole story.  In some respect Oz did do just that.  My problem with the movie was it could have been so much better.  If only Steven Spielberg had done it and not Disney.  Spielberg did such a good job with Hook.  Oz had way too much fluff among the plot.  It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a children's movie or adult's.  It was embarrassing to see the way the Munchkins were introduced.  If only the brief musical numbers had been of the same quality as those in The Wizard Of Oz.  Much of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />The idea of the piranha like Water Fairies was the first hint that Oz was going in the wrong direction.  James Franco,the actor who played the Wizard, reminded me too much of Jeremy Piven who played Mr Selfridge in that he as was whinny and annoying.  When the flying monkey first dealt with Oz's carpet bag, it was so heavy that he could only drag it, but minutes later, he had it flung over his back and was walking at a good pace.  Later it became light enough that he could fly carrying it.<br /><br />A nice touch was a Mr Gale was mentioned over a loudspeaker during the sideshow sequence before Oscar took off in the hot air balloon: This gave a connection to Dorthy.  I did like the setting up of Glenda the Good and the Wizard but it was unclear which of the evil witches was the one which Dorthy Gale would vanquish in The Wizard Of Oz.  I suppose that it was the one who turned green and the other was the one under the house.<br /><br />This is worth seeing, but do as I did; buy it used.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Never delete this app it is the 2 best app next too computer minecraft<br />The best part is that you can spawn pigs
B00CTXBO9M|1.0|I can't believe I have to pay for other themes. I have the theme 1 on my phone. P.S. My opinion is THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE IS WWWAAAYY better than the kindle store. &amp; You can get it on google play 4 FREE! IT'S SOOO STUPID &amp; IT MAKES ME MMMAAADDD!!!!!!!!! I ha
B00DW39B2K|1.0|Poorly rendered vehicle for man v. man conflict.  De Niro a not very compelling and quite contrived and superficial character. Travolta with an unfortunate accent that makes the hope of hearing any message in the strained dialogue impossible. Give it a miss.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I deleted it I tried to put it back on my kindle it didn't work I do not like it do not buy it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Heard a lot about this show and had to see what the excitement was all about.  Great way to catch up on seasons missed.
B005HSL626|1.0|I have a kindle fire 2nd gen and no matter how much i unistall and reinstall it freezes whenever i open a game. It just wont let me slice..ugh
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this series or whatever it's called once I start reading it I can't stop. It is awesome I can't wait to read more
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Dislike the new upgrade very much. Want the previous version back.New version is not user friendly. Too much useless fluff.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Timeless songs sung by new artists with Tony Bennett.<br />Some great duets, some okay...but the CD's is definitely worth<br />a listen.
B009S33I68|4.0|I recently spent a morning listening to stories told by Medal of Honor recipient Bruce Crandall, the courageous helicopter pilot featured in the movie version of We Were Soldiers.  Amazed at the depth of details he provided (most of which were excluded from the movie), I decided to read the book to get the whole story.  In short, the battle at LZ X-Ray (and follow-on battles at Albany and Columbus) were far more complex and significant than Hollywood's ability to portray them. Hal Moore and Joe Galloway have truly done a tremendous service to the cause of American History in compiling this work, and I recommend this book to a broad audience of history buffs, military veterans of all eras, and patriotic Americans.  Reading this book has renewed my respect for the veterans of the Vietnam War, and I stand in awe of the horror they endured on behalf of the country they served.
B006ZPJWBM|4.0|The music is good, but the DVD version is kind of what makes it.<br />...the connection between Tony and his guests.  Old songs,<br />new artists - so many favorites.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great costumes, great countryside, great writing and great acting. Missed when aired on PBS, so watch all episodes in one evening.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's Fun, challenging, the game has nice colors and I love playing this game and you will too hour after hour
B005K17RU0|2.0|Most recent update took a very good app and crapafied it. Maps don't work on either phone (one jelly bean, one ice cream sandwich) or my tablet (Nexus 7). Seems like the app doesn't even realize that it isn't running since the only display from the animated maps that displays anything is the legend and the time loop.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I've loved dragonvale ever since I downloaded it, though after level 15, the game starts to get slow. It takes over a week to level up, and some of the things get way to over priced. And unless you constantly level up, you can get to the point of having nothing to do, except collecting your dragon's money. Oh and I bought the gemstone island thinking I could buy gemstone dragons with coins, because if the habitat could be bought without using gems, the dragons shouldn't have to be bought with them either. Sadly though after buying the island, it turns out the cost of one dragon is 700 gems, or 25$ worth, if you were to waste your money buying them. That is retarded. This is one of the many problems of the game, not having enough gems. They need to give you like 5 a day, because I don't want to have to spend money, on a large amount of gems that would take  a year to get without paying. When I first bought it, I'd give it a 5 star rating, but now, it's a little over 3 and a half.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I only happened across this film...Thrilled! This is a film to watch more than once,remember and share.<br />Ezra Miller is an actors actor. Watch him... he may be around for a long time... with any luck.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|Saw this at the movie theater when it came out.  Was not disappointed but was not wowed.  I think I was expecting or was projecting the lead character role I had in my mind and so I struggled with Orlando Bloom in the part.  Later I bought the standard DVD.  On viewing the movie again, knowing how Bloom would be directed and play the part I found a whole new appreciation for the film.  The film work is superb and the sound is perfectly supportive of what is happening on the screen.  The Blue Ray Director's Cut fulfills Ridley Scott's initial and desired presentation of the film.  it is significantly longer with purpose and adds to the overall scope of the movie.  The full 1080 resolution opens the cinematic detail of the film and the sound is crystal clear and detailed.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars but that is not available.  I reserve 5 stars for maybe a dozen films and that may be more of how those particular films have deeply affected me.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|TERRIFIC .  i HAVE ENJ0YED ALL THREE OF THE BOOKS AND I CAN't  WAIT FOR THE 4TH BOOK. WHEN WILL IT BE OUT/
B001JNNDGA|5.0|If you have not seen this film directed by Mel Gibson as a result of all the media reaction, or the personal life of the movie's director, or that it is just some sort of religious horror movie, or that it is an anti-Semitic tirade, or that (fill in whatever reason is dissuading you from viewing the movie), then I would ask you to set aside preconceived notions and view it.  But be warned, it is brutal and unforgiving in its portrayal of a most amazing human being to walk our earth.  The use of Aramaic and Latin give a depth and poignancy to the film that is not realized till after the film is over.  We have not heard a particular accent that may be British, South African, or the varied American flavors to detract from the power and depth of what is portrayed on the screen.  Gibson's direction is remarkable.  The actors take this very particular and most intense period of time beyond any previous portrayal given to the passion this Yeshua (the Aramaic name for Jesus) experienced.  The violence is not gratuitous.  What is in the writings (the gospels and other early written material) depicts a most horrific account of the torture and execution of this Yeshua.  Again be warned, it is very difficult to watch.  Know this.  As a film all on its own, separate from a &#34;religious&#34; point of view, The Passion Of The Christ achieves a level of acting, direction, camera and sound work that should be looked at and studied.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent storyline, character development and scenery. Love the story look forward to season 4. Thanks Amazon for putting it on prime!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. It's one that stays with you for a while. I had to ponder it a couple of days and do some re-reading before I could move on to another book. The switching back and forth between time settings was confusing, but interesting. There were a lot of characters to keep straight and I found myself having to go back and check them out at times. The personal struggles and conflict between right and wrong well done.
B005EI86JU|4.0|I highly recommend this book for someone new to the Nikon D7000.  It's a great step-by-step guide and much better than the instruction booklet you get with the camera.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|A Downton Abbey-esque timepiece that allows the reader to escape into Grace's world.  The author effortlessly transitions from modern times to perfectly illustrated memories making the reader want for more. A worthy read, especially for those of us with limited time for ourselves.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I just became a fan of this band.  Their music is amazing.  Not one bad song on the cd.  love them all.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|If you've never played this type of game there will be a pretty steep learning curve but it's basically &quot;send your armies to take over control points.&quot; This particular game is pretty, and slick. The difficulty curve is really steep, and I'm not sure I understand the xp system, or at least how it's calculated. But, overall enjoyable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The entire 3rd season is killer.  The entire season's episodes kept the mrs and I on the edge of our seats.  We cannot wait to see what happens in the 4th season!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I had not seen this movie since I was a child. I forgot how enjoyable it was, and what great fun it is. I was happy to add this one to my Disney collection.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|This is the kind of movie is representative of the action movies that Tom Cruise has been making for years.  It's full of action with limited character development.  The criminology element was interesting and should hold the interest of the CSI types out there and while the action scenes are a little over the top they're not so outrageously unrealistic as to distract from the rest of the movie.<br /><br />So what's my issue?  For those who have read the Jack Reacher books they know that Jack is 6'5&#34; tall, weighs around 250 pounds, and has dirty blonde hair and ice blue eyes.  In his background, Jack was a military Sergeant and Police Officer who mustered out in 1997 (several years before the Jet Li style martial arts craze) and used more of a brawler style of fighting when his size didn't intimidate people into backing down and giving him what he wanted.  Think of Dolph Lundgren when he played the Russian in Rocky IV.  The idea of Tom Cruise being the intimidating brawler is a joke at best and from movie poster alone it's easy to see that Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher.<br /><br />As a fan of the books, I would have rather seen them start with the first book, &#34;Killing Floor&#34;, which not only kicked off the series, but because it takes place in the mid 1990's when Jack would have been in his mid to late 30's.  This means they could have chosen a younger actor who better fit the character and played Jack Reacher for another 20 years whereas Tom Cruise doesn't have too many action movie years left.  All said, it was an enjoyable movie as long as you realize it's a poor Jack Reacher movie.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|My favorite is still Closer, but this one is very listenable. I like all his work. I find these albums very relaxing and great for falling asleep to.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|When I saw this on Amazon, I had to have it! The blu-ray plays perfectly, no scratches, no hesitations, and my daughter loves the movie.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I just noticed this app only yesterday and with caution I downloaded it and cleaned my cache and empty folders and tasks and it freed a lot of space. I did not check any boxes to deal with apps because I did not want to loose information. It also runs in the background and will let you know that it can kill some unwanted tasks. Nice product - Kindle Fire HD does need a CCleaner and this is it!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Arrived extremely quickly, and plays perfectly. No scratches or hesitations when playing, and is precisely as described! Plus, Robert Downey Jr. What's not to love?
B00DURILJ2|1.0|Mud is a very poor movie that offers no thrills and the two big name actors have minor roles. In other words, you might watch this at the beginning of nap time because sleep is a certain outcome.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A wonderful picture and a great cast.  I would recommend this seller and the movie to anyone who wants good service and a great flick Thanks again for everything
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|Poor streaming quality from Amazon. It buffered so much we just had to stop watching it. Moving on to Vudu for movies.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|For you Si-Fi lovers this is a MUST SEE!  Special effects, acting and panoramic views, make this a dynamic adventure into the world of Space and the control of it!  Cannot think of a better way to enjoy yourself on a summers night with family and friends. Buy it and begin the adventure!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read some of the reviews before buying this book. One person didn't like how she told what was happening to her then jumping to the present. I liked that she put in her &#34;reflections&#34;. It helped understand what she was going through. This story just amazes me how she could survive the horrible things that happened to her.
B00B4804KS|5.0|For those who saw the original version, this 3D disc is AMAZING and more fun to watch than ever!  It brings to life the true scope of the adventure and puts you right into the action.  If you EVER buy a 3D movie, make it this one, you won't be disappointed
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is really awesome, and everything, but Be careful with updates!!!  You just might lose everything!!!!  Really!  I mean, REALLY!!

This show has a little of everything to keep one wanting more!!!  It is really a good show. Thank you Amazon for providing it on prime. Yet again you prove to be awesome....
B004K4IZ54|5.0|A SI-FI thriller in 3D.  I thought 3D movies would only be good in the theater on a large screen, I was WRONG!  On my Samsung 3D T.V.  this movie shined through with Brilliant colors, Deep Blacks and the action is impeccable clear.  If you own a 3D T.V. I suggest you buy this movie and enjoy it to the limit
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The show was a little slow starting the season off,but by the end really had me hooked.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next season.  This Green Arrow is far different than what was portrayed in Smallville, which is a good thing.  I did like the Smallville version, but this is its own show making its own path, and if the audience and network give it a chance, I can see a long running of the series.  So far, the villains are regular villains, not superpowered for the most part (although there are some highly skilled opponents of course).  I know very little about the comic book version so I don't know how long time fans of his will feel, but I definitely recommend this show.
B00A812HOS|5.0|I was very satisfied with my purchase and it was in brand new condition which was a big plus for me.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|As I was reading through this beautiful book my heart and soul had to agree with the author. I will re-read it often.
B0039YZPZ4|4.0|Great story line. You have to pay close attention because there are a lot of twists in the story. Also, some of the lines go by pretty quick. Over all a very good movie.
B006885EFE|5.0|Nothing short of amazing, this 10 part series is a must see for young and old alike.  I cannot recommend Band of Brothers enough ( not only do I have the digital version, I also own the original box set).
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I found this difficult to go from one level to another, found it had little to no instructions and just kept bringing me back to level one.  Got rid of it....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this for more variety on my Kindle Fire. My 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son love this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really fun game I couldn't stop playing it just wish I could have named my horse. Give it a try
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is an really nice game I have an kindle fire and it works great. Download the game I unlocked all people and I am really good at Sniper
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is such a great book because it shows the reader the hardships for august pullman in 5th grade especially with his deformed face. The book shows how he overcame his problems with friendships and controlling his emotions. He ends up having a lot of people loving him and having many friends!
B00009XITP|5.0|Best movie ever I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Amanda Bynes is crazy lately but I LOVED her in this movie!!! This has to be my favorite movie expect for twilight!

B000HL093A|1.0|Stone swung and missed badly with this one. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they were looking for a bad trip experience.
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|Too bloody, hard to control, and boring , are just a few words I`d use for this this for this
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My eyes hurt from reading so long! I just can't stop reading! What an awesome political war-drama! Engrossing to say the least!
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|This is great music.  Beth Hart delivers from the heart.  Her voice is so strong, genuine and down-to-earth real blues.  Joe Bonamassa is a fantastic guitarist and a perfect match with Beth Hart.  I love this album.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|i have tried this app a few times. i cant seem to advance from the first room. couldnt find any hints to use or any help site. might be good for someone else but not for me.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This book was hard to put down. I could see many similarities to the racial tensions of years ago, and some that linger today in society and our judicial system. The story was exhilarating and a true Grisham novel. Awesome!
B004GYY714|5.0|i love this app. so nice to listen to stations without all the chatter and commercials that other radio stations have. i would recommend this app.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is simply unbelievable.  You should not be disappointed with her performances of these songs.  She was the gem found during Britain's talent competition.
1476712042|5.0|*I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This, however, did not influence my review in any way.*<br /><br />This book was not what I expected at all. I have been hearing great things about it and I have been hearing horrible things too, but in the end, I'm still giving it five stars.<br /><br />Travis is the kind of guy that Abby wants to avoid at all costs. The gambling, the drinking and the dark past - she doesn't want to go back to being the old Abby but how will she stay away from him once she realizes that behind those tattoos and killer looks, he's also just like her... broken and a disaster.<br /><br />When I read the first few pages of the book, I knew right then and there that this was going to be something that's a little different from the other romance books that I have read out there. I know that Travis can be a real jerk, and Abby described him perfectly.<br /><br />Reading this book is like riding a rollercoaster, I felt confused, happy, gloomy, giddy, all sorts of emotion that you can think of out there. It is one unpredictable story that I will never ever forget. One of the reasons why is because of Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox. He's temperamental but he's also sweet and funny at times. He can be possessive but he can also be protective. He can be a douche but he will undoubtedly leave everything behind for the one he loves. I can't even believe that this guy is a straight A student. I mean, come on, with the lifestyle that he has, the fights that he participates in and the girls that he's screwing with, I am very stunned by this fact - in a good way. He was not what I expected him at all to be. And I like that.<br /><br />As for Abby Abernathy, I have a love-hate relationship with her. I loved her smart ass answers to Travis' flirty attempts to get her to bed, and I also loved how she tried to stay away from the lifestyle that she was used to. But there were times when I also wanted to smack her in the head and tell her to just make her decision about Travis. One minute she wants him, then the next, she will push him away and I think that she was also selfish at times. And her dates with Parker, I don't even want to start about that. But what I liked about her was that she always stood by her decision. And also, her friendship with America amazes me every single time I try to remember the things that they have gotten through together. They can be brutally honest with each other and they also fight, but I have to say, that I really admire their friendship.<br /><br />The fast pacing of the story also drew me in; it was packed with action, romance and a little bit of humor courtesy of America, Travis and Abby.<br /><br />I loved how the two main characters were both equally broken-- but in very different ways. They are dysfunctional together, but they are also perfect for each other.<br /><br />\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him and he's hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\\" I smiled at the ceiling. \\"It doesn't matter what or why it is. When it's good, Kara... it's beautiful.\\"<br /><br />One was trying to escape her old lifestyle and to start a new chapter, while the other one was still continuing his ways and going on with his life, no matter what people said about him. Travis is one guy who surely knows what he wants and when he wants it, and he will do everything in order to protect those people that he loves. Abby, on the other hand, will do everything just to get away from her past and she always worries about what other people will say about her. Their relationship is not the perfect one, and not even an ideal one, but the fact that they both strive to be better people each and every day that they're together makes this story more appealing to me, and to the other readers out there.<br /><br />But most of all, I loved the maturity that I saw in the characters toward the end of the story. Travis tried to be more considerate and not overly jealous and Abby finally knew what she wanted from Travis. Also, the slow progress of their relationship was another thing that I liked. It was not forced and it was well thought of.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster will leave you wanting more. INTENSE. RIVETING. ADDICTING. It is a DISTRACTINGLY RAVISHING story that readers will look forward to. I'm sure that people won't forget Travis and Abby's disastrous yet beautiful relationship.us and Abby finally knew what she wanted from Travis. Also, the slow progress of their relationship was another thing that I liked. It was not forced and it was well thought of.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster will leave you wanting more. INTENSE. RIVETING. ADDICTING. It is a DISTRACTINGLY RAVISHING story that readers will look forward to. I'm sure that people won't forget Travis and Abby's disastrous yet beautiful relationship.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I originally wanted to see this movie due to the computer animation which was used.  However, after watching it, even though the computer animation was phenomenal, the storyline and the characters made it memorable.  I don't want to spoil the plot or the ending, so I'll leave the rating as 5 stars and encourage anyone considering it to definitely get this movie.  You won't be disappointed.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie!!! Really didn't think I would like it much. I had not seen it on the big screen!  We bought a 3D t.v, and this was the movie of choice from my family. Love it!!!!! Buy it! I've seen it over and over...3D is awesome!!!

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|(Note: I will eventually update this with a Blu-ray review when I get around to it, someday).<br /><br />I had the absolute pleasure of watching \\"Pacific Rim a couple of days ago in IMAX 3D. I'd actually been listening to the soundtrack a couple of weeks straight prior to, as I had done with \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness,\\" since I'm a big enough nerd to really appreciate the unsung hero of a film: its music. And just as it did for Trek, the score by itself was enough to get me hyped up and excited for what I was sure to be another personal all-time favorite.<br /><br />That being said, PacRim is one-of-a-kind. When I saw Michael Bay's \\"Transformers,\\" I was amazed at the craftsmanship that went into the design, execution, and scale of the giant robots. Well, with all due respect to Bay and his crew, he's just been outdone by Guillermo Del Toro and *his* crew.<br /><br />The plot of PacRim is a pretty simple one: kaiju (literally Japanese for \\"monster\\" a la Godzilla and that whole monster-movie genre) are attacking humanity. To counter the threat of kaiju, humanity built these equally gigantic two-pilot robots called Jaegers. But when the stupid unified government decides to abandon the Jaeger program, the kaiju threat becomes increasingly greater with only a dwindling number of active Jaegers left to stop them.<br /><br />Now as an anime fan, I'm pretty sure I've seen all or bits of these plot elements scattered throughout many an incarnation of live-action or animated Japanese media. As I mentioned, the kaiju self-reference to Godzilla should be an obvious influence in itself. And sure, the giant robot (aka \\"mech\\") thing was already achieved in Transformers.<br /><br />However, the big differences to me between PacRim and Transformers is: 1) the sheer scale and size of the kaiju and Jaegers (which I'd estimate to be 3-4 times bigger than Optimus Prime); 2) the magnitude of the fight (two human pilots inside the Jaeger battling a giant monster, as opposed to a bunch of humans watching sentient robots fight each other); and 3) the very clear-cut style of reference to Japanese cinema (and yes, by \\"cinema\\" I also mean anime, 'cause I consider it genuine medium of art).<br /><br />From the creature/robot design to the fight coordination and even to the common anime-esque character archetypes, this is the, by far, one of the coolest things I've ever seen made into live-action. And I'm so glad my first viewing was in IMAX 3D. Seeing such huge monsters and robots on a such a big screen in 3D only made the space depth *that* more gargantuan.<br /><br />I highly, *highly* recommend this for anime fans (especially if you like mech titles). And while there aren't a lot of big names in terms actors or actresses or that \\"deep\\" of a plot (this ain't a psychological character study, so don't go expecting this to be a Christopher Nolan film or something), it's *so* finely crafted from a technical perspective (visually and musically) that I'm sure most anyone can at least appreciate it as the escapist spectacle that it is.<br /><br />This is easily my favorite film of the year, so far. So go see it, preferably in IMAX 3D, or at least Real 3D.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|great tool kit. everything as described. hard to find bits all in one neat package. I recommend it to all the gadget fixers
B0090SI582|5.0|After the disastrous film that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine, FOX sought to make a movie that would redeem the Wolverine in the eyes of fans and audiences. In comes James Mangold and a script based on the highly popular story arc by Chris Claremont. Now we have The Wolverine, a film that sets new boundaries of what can be done in comic book films.<br /><br />The Wolverine is a much more personal tale about Logan and his ruined life after the events of X-Men 3. He can see dreams of Jean Grey who he had to kill against his wishes to save people. He lives like a hermit in the woods until a young woman, Yukio, tells him of a dying man who wishes to see him. What follows is Wolverines trip to Japan, losing his healing factor and his journey to protect the dying old man's granddaughter Mariko.<br /><br />Some fans of the original comic run by Claremont may feel distressed over the changed characters in the movie, but it isn't something that should ruin the film. The certain twists with the characters of Silver Samurai and the rather interesting villain found in Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper, create for an enjoyable plot line surrounding Jackman's troubled character.<br /><br />Some may also take issue with the love that Wolverine has for Jean Grey, seeing as how the Grey's character is Cyclop's love in the comics. Viewers may not think of this, but through Wolverine in the majority of the X-Men films, Logan's love for Grey is very one sided and that one sided love helps to shape this dream version of Jean.<br /><br />Speaking of Hugh Jackman, he has done a fantastic job here as the Wolverine. He's ripped, he's loud but yet also gives us the chance to peer inside of him to see how much pain he is in throughout the movie. The location of Japan provides for beautiful imagery in certain scenes and it all blends well with our angry hero and his journey.<br /><br />The film takes it's time setting up the story and it's characters, providing much more drama than what is found ina typical superhero film and for me, that is a major benefit to help the film standout. The action takes a back seat to the drama of the story, but when the action does show up it's bloody (as PG-13 goes) and brutal. It's directed incredibly well, providing for great set pieces such as a well choreographed fight in and on top of a 300 mph bullet train. The third act, while changing the feel and tone from the rest of the film, provides great twists and an awesome conclusion.<br /><br />For me, The Wolverine did what Man of Steel did this summer, successfully reintroduce a character after a terrible film and give us, as viewers, a much deeper insight into them. And like Man of Steel, it broke new ground in what can be done in a comic book film.<br /><br />5/5
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow have not been hooked on a book like this in year, an amusing job keeping my attention. Love it!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|You need to be able to put your audio on \\"PCM\\" as the description says. Even has a sticker right on there saying so! Although I did switch the optical output format to \\"dolby digital\\" (under my flat screen menu), just to see if it would cut out and it still worked.<br /><br />Started right up, no problems- I could hear my analog strip and woofer receiving before I even turned on my Wii.<br />I used the optical option only, using a short optical cord from my TV directly into the converter box.<br /><br />My surround strip has just the two analog cables which fit easily and snugly..sleek design makes its easy to hide with wires, does not run hot at all.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Love the show, loving how I can relive it. Now someone bring this show back!! Don't care what network as long as it stays as good as it was!!
0345803507|5.0|If you like love stories. This is the ultimate one.  Great read couldn't have done a better job if they tried.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was anxious to read this after reading his previous one.  Not disappointed.<br />Intricately woven plot of a cast of interesting characters.  A mix of sadness<br />and joy.  Look forward to the next one.
B00A757EFW|4.0|My dad played this when he was younger. I love this game even know it is old school. It is a little hard to to move the character. but other wise very good
B009XIXVU6|5.0|My heart still remains with A Thousand Splendid Suns as my favorite one of of Hosseini's novels.<br /><br />Whereas &#34;Suns&#34; followed a few major characters throughout, this book felt to me more like a novel of connected stories.  Each of these stories is fascinating, richly detailed and populated with characters who are utterly real in their humanity.<br /><br />I enjoyed every page of it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I played this on my friends phone after that i was addicted to the game. They change the setting every few weeks so you change the course a little bit and you have to get and find new stuff. Must Get!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is something else my granddaughter ordered without my knowledge and again, I have absolutely no idea what it is.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I got this app to replace my diary. It is ok. You can make multiple notebooks. You can name them and pick there color. You also can draw in them. It's pretty cool.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun get game very addictive my kids love it give it a try its a great game with good humor
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I have read all the other Diary of a Wimpy kid books. I find them very funny. This one is just the same. It about love and dates. I would say this is one of the best ones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is completely free unless you wanna buy coins and gems and its so alike to owning a real horse. You can enter competitions, horse treks, perform in TV shows, and be in special events and more. You have to do work but it's fun doing it.
B000LZMO08|3.0|Okay but fairly tedious.  I wouldn't read it again.  It was a book club choice and led to a good discussion.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Kept me fully entertained. I had a hard time waiting to the end.  Just wanted to skip to the end to see how it ended.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Even our grand baby like to watch and dance to this. Great fun with many favorites. Can't wait to buy more.
0385523394|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I almost didn't get it because of the bad reviews that says all she talks about is being a fish out of water as \\"nice girl\\" in prison and that she over-mentions her college education.  Of course, there was some of that, but it certainly didn't dominate the book.  I found myself being really interested in what was going to happen to Piper and her thoughts on where she was and how she got there.  I highly recommend this book.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I am new to the epic fantasy genre and the only other book I have read prior to this is The Game of Thrones (first book of A Song of Ice and Fire). GoT proved to be a slow read for me since every chapter changes to a different character in a different setting. So I find myself reading one chapter at a time and can be a bit tedious to keep track of the many characters in the story. Blood Song proved to be quite different since there is a central character and there is continuity when moving from one chapter to the next. So for me it was a quick read and I agree with some of the other reviewers that you could read the entire book in a weekend. Since I am new I find myself referring to the dictionary as well as the map quite often. Speaking of the map, it is small enough i.e. not too many regions and towns to keep track of. Just do a google on Blood Songs Map and you'll see what I mean. Whether you are new to fantasy or a veteran, I highly recommend the book.
B00947N6UG|5.0|What is there to say...this movie was EPIC!!!  Epic story, epic characters, epic voice acting, and epic visual beauty!!!  This is a must for family movie collection.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Gaiman satisfies deeply with a multi-layered narrative that brings an ordinary world and an extraordinary world into a fine dance. This is the first of his books I have read. It won't be the last.
B001DJ69E8|5.0|Every song on here is AWESOME!!!  I will definitely by more music like this, because I have always loved the music you hear during the previews of movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. Came in late in watching it. Netflix didn't have season 3 so I got Amazon. Watching it with my Roku, which I love too!
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|It lived up to its title.  My husband even jumped.  If you want a little fright tonight, this is it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids and I both love this game! it's.  it's adorable. and a bit addictive. great for a free game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great on the go bible. Everything is at your fingertips. Can read at wrk on break, while traveling in the car, or at church. Thx!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|It's not just a movie about an imaginative and lonely girl in Paris. It's about Paris, yes, and a shy girl, and desire, shyness, imagination, death, life, memories, the limits we place on ourselves, and overcoming them. Get your things around you. Commit the time to this movie. And sit down to watch it all the way through. It's worth it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book was a wonderful read. Beautiful story, beautifully expressed. I kept finding myself highlighting sentences and paragraphs. Read it!
B008476HBM|4.0|I liked even though it was hard to understand at times. I just spark noted some chapters. I love jane austen.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A must read for anyone down in the dumps or suffering from depression and the like. I heartily recommend it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Absolutely one of my favorite games.  I love the mental challenge it provides.  I change tactics often to challenge myself.
0812416317|5.0|It can be a bit descriptive for a lot of people, but I just feel like it's one of the great stories of all time. It also has one of the most gripping endings of all time. I can only think of a couple books off the top of my head that I enjoy more. Fantastic book worthy of any and all praise you have heard.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this series any more, but I just have to keep on reading it 'til it ends...<br />It was pretty good, though the story line gets more and more unrealistic with each of a new book...
B008602KQI|5.0|outstanding movie with a surprise ending... Could be real life in a few more years, good to watch more than once.
1250046971|1.0|This book is god awful. If anyone ever told me they thought this book was good, I would never trust their recommendation ever again. The writing is all around horrible, and all the characters are textbook cliches. Here is a choice bit of writing from the book:<br /><br />\\"I guess it was time I took things into my own hands (after all, they are well manicured).\\"<br /><br />\\"I was reminding myself of Meg Ryan in the movie French Kiss after she ate all that cheese and had a lactose-intolerance fit. (Kevin Kline is really cute in that movie-well, for an old guy.)\\"<br /><br />\\"She reminded me of a young version of Sarah Jessica Parker (who I don't like, by the by-she's just so...so...annoying and unnaturally perky).\\"<br /><br />I know what you're thinking and no, I didn't add those pop-culture references in parentheses. Those are in this book...this book that got published...at regular intervals...so that I can't tell if I'm supposed to be reading a narrative or the diary entries of a whiny preteen girl. Since this book was written by an older Cast and a younger Cast, I imagine it was the job of the younger Cast to go through her mother's book and stick those pop culture references in there between parentheses.<br /><br />I don't mind books that are pure guilty pleasure, I'll even admit to getting some guilty pleasure from that first twilight book when I read it, but there is no pleasure in reading this, only guilt. It is like reading a 14 year old's fan fiction and I cannot remember another time where I was actually getting angry at a book while reading it because of sloppy, lazy writing.<br /><br />Here the short review:<br /><br />Don't buy this book, it's a cliched, poorly written piece of garbage with an unlikable, annoying protagonist to boot.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A bit hard to get into, but after a few pages I was hooked. A beautiful story, beautifully written. I will be thinking about this story for a long time.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Maybe I haven't given it enough time, but so far I haven't played it.  I haven't rejected it as yet, though.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loved all the books by Dan Brown.  Fascinated by the FreeMasons and all that surround it.  Very easy reading and quite enjoyable.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I don't want to spend my time this way.  I guess I am a solitary player, and I have no interest in this.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game and it makes you think....neat that you can switch between dominos and<br />Abyss. Good job designers and thank you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, have been playing for over a year.  Had to reload for some reason, latest version just as good
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Quite a lot of content in the free starter portion. Directions for the mini puzzles could be better. Also the hints are very obvious.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I felt like this book was trying to market itself towards both kids and adults, and in doing so fell short of both. While it was well written, the concept is more suited for a novel format as opposed to a short story. This book fell short of my expectations.
140006922X|1.0|This book title is very misleading.  Just a warning that you may not want to waste your money. foxnews.com has an article that explains very well what it is really all about.

B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  Disney's formulaic approach to the script, styling, acting, etc. took an neat idea and killed it.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|If you are a fan of the Alien movies, or Sci-Fi horror with emphasis on awesome Special Effects, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Though this movie has overtones about answering the mystery of human origins using a little ancient alien theory, at its heart it is an idea movie, a movie of intoxicating visuals, neat gadgets, and most of all, it is a space horror flick with very hungry aliens and unsuspecting prey.<br /><br />So expect gore, typical characters and plot for this genre, and awesome visuals, and you won't be disappointed.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. Sweet, sad, funny, dramatic, bittersweet.<br />One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|If you're looking for Citizen Kane you've come to the wrong cinema.  There isn't a lot cutting edge about Pacific Rim but there are a few things lacking from many other recent action films on show here.  One: A sense of fun and Two: Well rendered fight scenes that don't outstay their welcome.  Three:  Likeable characters. In other words its a successful example of its genre where bigger names have fallen flat.<br /><br />I was one of the many disappointed by Bay's Transformers so I was not the most likely candidate to find delight here but delight I found.  It's good old-fashioned fun and, okay, I'm Australian and it just didn't hurt that the fastest and most powerful jaeger was Australian.  We don't get to have a lot of national pride in international films and I'll take it.  I didn't even care that the accents were dodgy.  The Aussie spirit was and on song.  I felt like a kid again, bouncing in my seat.<br /><br />I mean Jaegers are cool!  The characters were likeable.  The female lead wasn't just there as eye candy.  The fights were epic to watch and well-rendered.  The side characters were amusing and endearing.  The cast clearly had fun.  There were laughs and there was emotion in a balance I found satisfying.  There may be a few mcgiffins and plot holes but I didn't care a bit.  I was having too good a time.  That's what the film sets out to be and it delivers.  It's not trying to redefine it's genre but it ticks all the boxes this kind of film should tick (More than a lot of action films do, that's for sure).<br /><br />I would have loved to see more of the other crews (I loved the little bit we got of the Russians and their jaeger was beautiful in its ugliness) though even with a longish running time the pace was rocketing and I guess there wasn't room. I would love to see an extended edition!<br /><br />Any film I come out of buzzing is worth the price of admission to me and I left Pacific Rim on a high.<br /><br />I know who I want to direct the next Transformers movie.formers movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is great for people who enjoy the adventure of caring and befriending horses. At first I thought it would glitch due to some of the reviews that I read. My friends however also own this app and have been begging me to get it. Ever since I got this app it has been enjoyable and would recommend it to any and all people.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|This version of The Great Gatsby has received mixed review and I am in no way surprised.  It's a bit of a dichotomy.  On the one hand we have an original Baz Luhrmann creation.  It has all the flim and flam of his earlier works and my feeling is it worked much better in those.  It fitted brilliantly into the seedy theatre of Moulin Rogue and added fresh stye to the substance of the Bard in Romeo and Juliet but here it left me cold.  It was a forced and obvious intrusion.  It was a pink sequined jacket on a penguin.  So isn't that a disaster?  Doesn't that ruin the whole production?<br /><br />In a word?  No.  You see, it's all rather bullet proof.  The human drama between the four main players, the strong, clever and earnest performances from its cast, the wonderful language of Fitzgerald, the message, are all there, all intact and no amount of fizz and razzle dazzle can undo the good work.  There may be attempts to batter the driving heart of the production but they all bounce harmlessly away.<br /><br />I didn't care that the music was incongruous or I could pick out certain visual licks from Luhrmann's earlier work.  I didn't care that there were small changes from the book or that it was told in flashback.  It's not the over-stuffed party that holds your attention, it's the quiet man passing through it.  Luhrmann made a brilliant call; he filled his movie with people who understood their characters and the story better than he did and, in that, he orchestrated a triumph.  I loved the book when I was first 'subjected' to it in highschool English class.  I loved Fitzgerald's way with words and I loved Nick and Jay and it's all here.  Everything I loved about the book is here so what do I care if there are clumsy highlighter marks and notes in the margins?  Fitzgerald's words can all be read, clear as day.<br /><br />Four stars, not at the least because, for most of the film, it made me care about Daisy Buchanan.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|great movie in HD and the streaming was great, no delays and it was free to watch was is always a plus.
B008JFUPFI|2.0|I really really wanted to like this film.  I so wanted Superman to received a movie worthy of his enduring affection in the public eye (and in mine).  I came out of Man of Steel wishing it had been made by someone else and hoping there will be no sequel produced by this team.<br /><br />Why?  To be honest I think they were embarrassed by their subject matter.  The word \\"Superman\\" is barely mentioned.  His colours are muted and strong attempts are made to turn the Man of Steel into the Son of God.  (He's 33 years old.  He's been wandering in the wilderness.  He's a powerful being hiding among men with the requisite beard.  His scenes with his adoptive parents reinforce the image).  To be honest I highly doubt his Jewish creators intended him to be Jesus but apparently super-powered Jesus is less embarrassing than Superman to Nolan and co.  Not to mention the fact the thing is as serious as a sermon.  There is little-to-no fun to be had here with only a moment of joy when the young Supes flies for the first time and a couple of clever bits of business, mostly involving Russell Crowe.<br /><br />If you know the Superman story there are no surprises and it's retold here (twice over in case the 30 minute prologue didn't do it for you).  To me it felt like going down a list and checking off element after element.  The editing was awkward, jarring at times.  The music was lifted straight out of Inception (though I don't blame Zimmer.  Who could find much fresh inspiration in the awkward and perfunctory script?)  It was almost as if the movie wasn't made for earth at all but for distribution to some far-away planet where no one knew anything about Superman.  It's a primer, a beginning.  It fills in but it has very little to say, especially if you know anything about Superman going into it.<br /><br />There is an emotional story to be told with Superman but it wasn't told here. I didn't feel a thing aside from an uncomfortable boredom.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad.  There were a few effective scenes.  I especially loved the cleverly orchestrated escape from a certain Kryptonian vessel, assisted by an effectively played holographic blast from the past.  I also liked that they found a much more interesting way to handicap Supes than throwing Kyrptonite at him.  The way the interloper's powers developed as they went along was also a nice idea.  There are even nods to Wayne Enterprises and Luthorcorp.  There was potential but the heart of the thing was in the wrong place.<br /><br />The cast were good, certainly very (very) earnest.<br /><br />Superman/Clark himself was a blank slate, low on personality, but that was more due to the clumsy script than Cavill's efforts.  Zod was angry and driven (and that's it).  Lois was bold and curious (though used in a very contrived way).  Everyone was just as you'd expect if Superman was a joyless franchise.<br /><br />Colour is desaturated as if Metroplis has been mistaken for Gotham City and Superman, who risked exposure for a handful of kids on a bus at one point, is knocking down sky-scrapers without a care in the overly-long fight scenes that make up the second part of the film, apparently giving no thought to the civilian population (Also known as Acting Out of Character).<br /><br />Nolan may get Batman but he doesn't appear to get Superman and I am not sure he minds.  Batman was made for love. I left feeling Man of Steel was made for money.  Nolan doesn't know how to come at his subject matter.  He doesn't know that you can be a little silly so long as you give Superman a real challenge and some balance.  Superman is good, he's almost too good, and if he isn't tempered he can be dry and dull.  He can be a Sunday sermon, an overpowered boy scout, and little more.  (Perhaps Nolan should have watch Captain America: the First Avenger to get some ideas on how to give a spirited treatment to a slightly hokey ideal).<br /><br />In Nolan's Gotham there was more fun to be had than in its less oppressive sister city.  After sitting through this joyless retelling I firmly believe there is something wrong with that.<br /><br />So I will keep waiting for the Man of Steel to truly take flight and rise again.e sister city.  After sitting through this joyless retelling I firmly believe there is something wrong with that.<br /><br />So I will keep waiting for the Man of Steel to truly take flight and rise again.

0062255657|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It was so well written, it was a joy to read.  I look forward to reading more of Mr. Gaiman's books.

B004UID2LC|4.0|This app is great for anybody who likes music or watching funny youtube videos on the go. You can search any youtube video and can get it! Please people who do not know how to review an app dont do it i took off 1 star because it messes up sometime. But it is a great app i have it for Kindle Fire Hd and it works great. Please dont listen to the other reviews because they are not true please try it.
0385474547|3.0|it was good......................................  I liked it alot. It  was a very  hard to read book however. But all in all itwas good.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Wish you could pick up more stuff at every location instead of getting one Item and than going back. To the location you where just at
B000QCS8TW|1.0|There were two many characters to really get to know them. had a hard time diminishing it.  Maybe the next will be better.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I kinda like this Dictionary but it needs more thing of setting and make purple bye people hope u do an
0770437400|4.0|I liked the &#34;Studs Terkel&#34; style of oral history approach to this genre. It was a good diversion. Although I find myself thinking too much about Zombies . . .
B005R32L66|1.0|I used to use Skype for chats until I saw a story about how Microsoft has access to the entire chat content, including any links sent over Skype.  Just to be clear, this is not part of prism, but Microsoft's own internal program that spies on every link you send on Skype.<br /><br />Now I use Threema for true end-to-end secure communication and can't wait for Heml.is to come out.  Heml.is is another product designed for true end-to-end secure connections.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Usually if where lucky we get to enjoy 3 maybe 4 songs from an entire CD but this CD I have t admit I have enjoyed at least 7-8 songs. Totally worth purchasing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie. It's quirky and fun. Bruce Willis is wonderful and Helen Mirren is delightful as a retired &#34;hit women&#34;.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Although this movie had very good performances from the cast .... I only found it to be marginally entertaining . I never got to the point where I actually cared for any of the characters . Just when it started to draw you in ... It took a turn ... And never came back to character development . The storyline jumped a bit , and had some really slow moments . It had funny parts but it certainly wasn't a comedy . The ending ... Wrapped things up .... But was predictable from early on . Glad I waited and rented it . It was worth renting .... But not theater admission .
B0064MGU98|5.0|It's great show with no commercials - it is nice to be able to do 2 two at a time.
B0098460O4|5.0|I accidentally discovered Jonathan and Charlotte while I was looking for something else on YouTube.  Their story is one that everyone should have a chance to know. It is a story of great friendship and of one person standing up for another. It is a story of courage in the face of terrible depression.  Their singing voices are simply beautiful together.  Jonathan, however, is truly blessed with a voice that touches my soul.  At such a young age, to have that type of voice and talent is quite a gift.  I wish them both the very best.  I have played their album over and over.<br />I hope they will always remain friends, even if their careers go in different directions.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Juliana Margulies is pretty amazing in this drama. It's fast-paced and I'm learning about how lawyers work on cases.  Good supporting characters, esp her assistant the investigator.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Great song. I wish they would play this song on the radio. I think the NERDS need to do and album.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Could be nice if dinos could do more things<br />But am very very very fun to have aquadic and regular........... And what now glacier!!!!!! Wooooooo hooooooo
B0063IH60K|2.0|Did not work well , it could be me and not the game , so you should get more reviews first .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LOVE this game. Something my family can share clean fun gaming. Can't get enough we have on all our devices.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't<br />It is very jumbled. When it works its great. When it doesn't, it just posses you off
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This is the first Neil Gaiman book that I wasn't thrilled with.  I enjoy his writing style and many of his stories, but I was left feeling like I must have missed something with this one.  It was a good read, but it didn't come together.  It felt forced, like all the ingredients for a good book were there but just didn't gel.  Still, I would recommend it because it is still good, just not one of his best.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Tried to relive the glory of the 1st one. Epic fail. Didn't even try to have much of a story. Just pushed the pedal down and drove nowhere.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I love this batman movie, it's so far my favorite of them all. heath edger killed the joker part... loved it
B008XG1X18|5.0|My daughter-in-law introduced me to Pinterest--& and I can hardly stay off of the site.<br />Love all the crafting ideas and recipes. We go camping & have found many new ideas for lighting; food & storage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it.<br />Very entertaining<br />Awesome<br />Easy to learn<br />User friendly<br />Absolutely love this<br />Very comparable to temple run, but better
B008OOYALE|5.0|I cannot wait to play the game. I  just bought it and it has not downloaded into my kindlefire yet.<br />Pam Leach
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|WAY, WAY, WAY too short!!!! I was totally shocked when it ended so quickly. Please hurry and come out with a follow up!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I'm trying to save all the babies. It is just what I love about this game. Some times I save all of them. Sure is fun.<br />Pam Leach
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love Doctor Who and this was a great season and all the other seasons are awesome too! WHOVIAN FOREVER
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|They had the most amazing cast of actors and the show was outstanding with it's special affects. Wonderful, the land of OZ!!!!  Pam Leach
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Watching Columbo on screen again is like having an old friend with you.  Beyond a doubt it's one of the greatest series and characters of all time.  Peter Falk has no equal.  He's a master as his illustrious career verifies.  The acting, the writing, the filming and editing is amazing.  The quality of the DVDs, superior.  I'd forgotten how truly great a program can be.  Treat yourself.  You deserve the wondrous gift of Columbo.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I personally do not care for Hobbits, but my husband loves them, so they get all stars from my husband.<br />Pam Leach
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Absolutely amazing first person shooter for the kindle. Out of the many I've tried this one is leaps and bounds above the rest. It feels a lot like a PC or console FPS. It obviously takes after team fortress in gameplay and style, but it's definitely not a bad thing. Controls are easy to pick up and multiplayer is great. All in all one of my favorite android games
B004WJRFYE|5.0|It's a great album, considering the fact it was recorded at his home. It's more closer to what he had in mind when recording what became Let It Be. Though not as raw and personnel as John's Plastic Ono Band, it has great tunes like That Would Be Something, Junk, Teddy Boy, and of course Maybe I'm Amazed. It definitely is a great buy if you're a Beatles enthusiast. It sure was for me!
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|Good movie. Nice combination of action, adventure and humor with a great acting cast! Retired agents from various agencies get together to find out why someone wants them dead. Gets very interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not a waste of space at all it is so fun you won't believe it don't believe me see for your self
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Just a Blast!!! You can beat the vintage style, midnight movie action!  Probably the best horror movie of its time.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The multiplayer is very solid and game modes are addicting and fun but I would want more game modes which can be on the next update!
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Just a Blast!!! You can beat the vintage style, midnight movie action!  Probably the best horror movie of its time.Funny and entertaining!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Does everything I need and beats stock. Got as FAOTD a long time ago and have used it every since.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|The book brought a complicated topic into something useful and understandable. To bring a new abstract topic into understanding without formalism.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|This is a rather unique sort of puzzle, and not as logic-based as sudoku or kenken. When the author says all the puzzles can be solved by logic, what it seems to mean is that if you get to the end and can't put in a number that makes both directions true, you can logically assume you've done something wrong.<br /><br />It would be nice if the pencil icon (for writing in possible guesses when you're not sure of the answer) should be at the bottom near the numbers, but even on an 8.9&#34; tablet, it's not that big a deal to reach the guess button and the numbers, so this is more of a tweak/suggestion than a real problem with the game.<br /><br />The only reason I'm taking off the one star is that the puzzles cannot be solved by logic in the same way sudoku or kenken problems can be. I'm sure that will be very frustrating for anyone who isn't already a fan of these types of puzzles (I recall getting books with pages of these things and I always enjoyed them).<br /><br />I got this as the free app of the day (FAotD), so my review and rating is based on the fact that this was free to me. If I paid 99 cents for the app, it's possible my rating could have been 3-star, but if you can also get it while it's the FAotD and you're a fan of these types of puzzles, I think it's a solid 4-star game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun. I love playing it, graphics are awesome, totally fun, and really adorable. If you love despicable me and the minions, this game is definitely for you :) It's also great for ALL ages. Not just children.
B00249MGCK|5.0|Great book, in a superb collectible edition. Always a great bonus when you can get a really fancy edition of something you'd like to read for a reasonable price.
0393343405|5.0|Fifty years BC, a well-educated, enlightened and wise Greek named Lucretius wrote a poem entitled &#34;On the Nature of Things&#34;. This once obscure piece changed forever the way many intelligent people view the world, and has recently been brought to popular attention with the publication of &#34;The Swerve&#34;. In chapter and verse, this wise fellow describes &#34;atoms&#34; and pretty much debunks the myths of god or gods.<br /><br />Having been an atheist since before I was ten years old, I read this book with both delight and disgust, as I continue to ponder why a vast majority of human beings alive today, despite the fact of evolution and good science, continues to believe that there is any being out there anywhere who will come and save us from ourselves.<br /><br />Overall a good read, right up there with Hitchens', &#34;God is Not Great&#34;; Dawkins', &#34;The God Delusion&#34;; and Epstein's, &#34;Good Without God&#34;; and more solid evidence that organized religion, rather than being a salvation for humankind, will turn out to be the root cause of our destruction as a species as on-going wars generated by the belief that &#34;my god is better than your god&#34; (when there are no gods at all) claim their grim toll. For substantiation of this statement, look no further than the Middle East  today, or any day, for that matter.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|All right George, fun but time to wrap it up, dude!  Don't get me wrong.  It's a great read but too much filler
B00992CF6W|5.0|I tottaly recommend this game it is super awesome!But I think it could use stuff from the Pc version like wolves because if you watch videos on YouTube like Skydoesminecraft you might want some stuff they have.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|If you loved the first book you will certainly love the sequel! It seems James and Bob were certainly meant to be together. A very heart-warming story indeed.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very we'll written book. This was a quick read.  The ending was very intense.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes historical reads.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I was given many mixed reviews for this movie and was a little concerned about the reviews. Yet, when I got the movie and watched it I was in love. Great story line and even though the ending was a little unexpected, I still loved the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A great story about young people who show great courage while facing cancer. A lot of twists and turns, and the spirit of optimism.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME it is awesome I even have it on my I phone and my I pod I would buy this every day
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is full of excitement and every page is thrilling! I liked this one better than the first one. But I don't recommend reading this before the first book, you need some background knowledge. Great book!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this app. Fun to look for all the clues. Kept me entertained for hours. Would recommend to anyone who loves puzzles.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I could readily recommend this novel for young/student aged readers.  Not sappy, not silly: the conflict is worthy of a novel for young people to read.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love my case!  It is a quality product!  It met my expectations fully.  I would buy it again or give it as a gift.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great story and build of characters. You'll want to keep watching it to know what happens in the story. Its a great TV show.
B00CHRBA12|5.0|It Rocks!!!!! The Allman brothers are the  best band ever. I could not have asked for a better CD, I love the additional songs on this CD!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the the game.  I dislike forcing me to write a review to play the game.  Or is there only ten levels?  What I have seen so far is very well done and will make you think.  If you like puzzle games then it is a definite must play.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|What would you submit yourself to in order to garner...heat, light and a real meal? Could you willingly leave your family behind? Amazing stories. Kudos to Ms. Derrick. Her patience and are work created an enjoyable and uplifting book. Even in the midst of...North Korea.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have enjoyed the ability to listen to my favorite radio station I left behind in Portland Oregon. Makes me feel I am in the big city.
140006922X|5.0|Admittedly, up until a week ago, I wasn't aware of Aslan's work but better late than never.<br /><br />I'm in awe of the amount of research that has gone to this book. I heard in one Aslan's interview that it's been researched for more than 10 years!  I'm half way through the book and, as one of the commenters has alluded, this book is very accessible; it's important to learn about the life of Jesus Christ from academic standpoint.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book- the writing, the story, and the sentiment.  I cried like a baby at the end.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for an engaging, moving read.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I give this one 5 stars! I love a show or movie that totally fits the era and this era is one I love. Great acting and story - good plot with some humor and serious issues too!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I cleaned up the unused apps from my Kindle. Call of Atlantis, is working as it should-great. What a difference!
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I first saw this on TV.....Love Hugh Jackman.....this is before he was a big name......but I love his character.... good looking too.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|These guys are special and together they are extra special. Great music, great sound, great guitar playing, great harp playing, and great singing. Keeping the Blues alive!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsay Stirling is simply amazing. Her music is fresh and lively, energetic and imaginative. And she's such a positive person. Buy this and you'll never have a down day again. It's bottled happiness...or magic...or something wonderful. Choose your own words...but buy the album.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Well written and directed keep up the great work. Looking forward to watching season two and many more to follow.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game should be like the minecraft for the computers like change game mode when he in survival servers and other better stuff
B007SNMYNS|5.0|It is easy to read and the content make a lot of sense. In fact, I tried the approach suggested by the author and in loss 10 pounds in 2 months!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book is both a pleasant and easy read. In my own humble opinion, such is the mark of a must have novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters and the scenery as well as the era costumes are ALL fabulous.  The ending of season 3 made me sad and NOT what I was expecting!  Looking forward to season 4!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and entertaining app, some levels had me stumped for a good while, just can't wait for more levels. And maybe more interactive on future levels.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This book was not at all what I expected. It started out really good and I loved the writing style, but the story got weird very quickly. The events that transpire do not ever link back to the character's present reality, making them seem pointless.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love it !!!! You can spend hours playing, and I love that you can really keep playing for free
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like this game. Very easy to learn but fun to play. Kind of creepy, but I like that kind of game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|not the best writer,she made bored housewives alive, they are not getting what they need.this book should be marketed<br />to men.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|great adaptation of the musical!  genius to weave a tale using a framework of early 1980's rock lyrics.  the music is infectious (maybe not so much for those who weren't alive then), and the casting was excellent.  there were a couple spotty performances that were painful to watch, but overall it was a fun movie with high replay value.
B00AALX5SI|2.0|It was eh OK. It would have been better if she didn't love herself so much. The more tender moments with her family and friends was nice but those were far and few between.<br />Turned it off early. Sorry if I've offended those Katie Perry Fans.<br />Still love her music though!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Any Doctor Who fan should have this in their collection.  It is a must have!  It is very well done!
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Very interesting. It is chilling to think what the Jewish people had to go through.  We should beware that this could happen to us Christians and the Jews in the. USA.  I was amazed at her strength.  Excellent book.
1455502626|5.0|The sinister feeling hangs throughout the work.  The action is fast, and the plot is complex, and Detective John Corey provides humor throughout.  A must read!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was very unique. It gets the brain juices flowing. I was stumped a few times and had to youtube the answers. I'm really sad that there are only ten levels. Game over I guess.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a good mind workout and it is addicting!  I don't want to put it down, and I find myself wishing I hadn't started it until after I had gotten my to-do list done, I guess housework can wait until tomorrow.  It is not going to get done today!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved both of Mr. Hosseini's other books and was very excited but a little worried that this third book couldn't/wouldn't be as good but I am happy to say I LOVED this book too!  I love how he started the book with an old legend and somehow wound it through the book.  It was never predictable and the human stories he tells are unforgettable.  I'm so happy I read this book and truly will treasure it forever.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|After watching a little of the television series, I was interested in reading the book.  The two are nothing alike!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Although Northanger Abby is not as well known or as highly regarded as Pride and Prejudice or even Sense and Sensibility, it remains my favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I first read it at 16 and have just re-read it at 32 and it has lost none of its charm and humor. I cannot recommend it highly enough! It is lighthearted and romantic, perfect for summertime! It is a good novel for a young person who has never read Jane Austen to begin with. Once you have enjoyed Northanger Abby you will be better prepared to enjoy other Jane Austen novels.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I could watch this all day. All the characters are lovable, funny, and quirky. I'm collecting one season at a time.
030789701X|5.0|Yeah, It's really helpful.  Now I don't have to constantly go back and forth between the game and the computer in my room for help with the game!
B000002JSP|5.0|Greatest album of Led Zeppelin music ever produced. All music just wonderful.Recommend to everyone regardless of age.Completely satisfied with purchase..
B00628RVV0|5.0|Great movie to shed a perspective on the holocaust and life in Germany during that time. Everything that i am sure we have already seen and heard BUT here is done through the eyes of the children, not just the adults, which perhaps sheds a more soulful and heartfull perspective. And what an ending! Makes your world stop even just for a minute and think about humanity in general and how we treat each other.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wicked fun game. Good graphics. Easy to play. Entertaining. I really like how it is a female heroine and all that stuff.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I LOVED THIS PRODUCT,<br />Very versatile and the 5 foot length was perfect for use.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Kindle Fire
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions. This game is temple run but with minions and bombs. I really enjoy the challenge and change in adventures.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read all the wool series books and several silo books by other authors. There great! You will not be disappointed
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|The music is perfectly lovely and relaxing! I would def recommend this artist/album to a friend!! It's very mellow, and since I sleep with music on, it's just perfect!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|I bought this movie for a Christmas present for my daughter because she loves to watch movies at College when she comes home. She thought this movie was great she loves anything that is done by Tim Burton and has all his movies. She says it is a great family movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game because on survival you fight ZOMBIES!! And on creative you can spawn your own animals. BUY, BUY BUY!!!#<br /><br />BUY!!!! BUY!!!! BUY!!!
0553801473|5.0|This book arrived super quickly, and was a great price for a first edition. Can't wait to finish the book before it so I can start reading
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played survival craft demo. Then survival craft. Next Mincraft that was my new favriote game I love it. 5 star rateing!!!!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun and challenging game. Super addictive and good for all ages.<br /> Can't wait for more rooms to play. Would highly recommend! The only negative is that there aren't enough chapters
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool awesomeness and you can not believe that I love the idea of this game so awesome awesomely cool stuff like you have done so awesome awesomely cool stuff
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I admit I liked this game at first. But more than once I have gotten to level 16 only to have the game freeze up then lose all my progress, causing me to have wasted a lot of TIME creating my Reef and also lost REAL MONEY because I had purchased pearls and lost the advancement they bought me.  I even had to request a refund of my purchases due to the game malfunctioning.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. All three books were very well described,lots of details from so many point of views. It kept me hanging on to the next detail.
1781162646|5.0|I read this book in about 3 days.  It is one of Stephen King's best as far as I am concerned.  You won't want to put it down.  It's not a \\"horror\\" story per se although it does touch on the \\"supernatural\\".  It has great characters, mystery, and romance.  I highly recommend this one!
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Colin Farrell was fantastic! Plot was a bit hard to follow at times, but overall time well spent! Excellent flick!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Horribly written, broadly overacted, and just plain boring. Disney films are usually notable for their uniquely-drawn characters and clever dialog, which help even the most predictable stories succeed. There's none of that here. No irony, no wit, nothing fun or funny--just stock characters saying their stock lines and mechanically performing their blocking while the camera sweeps around to try and make it all look \\"magical.\\" Maybe a very young child would be entertained by the pretty, saturated colors, but that's about all this movie's got going for it.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|How could one not like a movie that featured Morgan Freeman backed up by Tom Cruise! Time went by very quickly!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Your basic Solitaire game with a few added features.  I like that you can tap on the cards (or sets in sequence) in addition to swiping to move them;  But when you do, the computer puts your card where it thinks (or knows) is best.  And you don't have to think, decide, or even look to see if a card can be placed if you don't want to.  All you have to do is tap each deal card and the computer will place it for you if there's a spot.  Great if you need a little help from time to time, or if you just want the computer to spoon feed you a win.  But it takes the challenge flat out of it.  I lost interest and decided to uninstall.  There are lots of other games out there far more engaging.
B00000DGUG|4.0|I think this is Alanis Morissette's greatest work. It soars and leaps and pulls the listener in with some softer tones. Her lyrics are poetc and clear and powerful and I think her special gift is her intensity of heart, reflected in this album better than any of her other works.
B00139XTG4|4.0|Shares some good insights and redefines the words risk and expert for me.  Starts to drift latter and became a little indulgent.
1611761808|3.0|The Kite Runner, his first was great. The second not as good as the first and this one started out great, the middle drug and the end was only OK. Very disappointing.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of acting like a kid while being a grown up.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|good series, wont be disappointed, unless you don't like good story and drama. Loved it from beginning to end for sure.
B00003CXIP|5.0|A classic coming of age movie.  Kids on an adventure discuss life, death, and what the hell is Goofy anyway?
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode, and i was blown away by the finale. I love this show now!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have rarely watched a series that I enjoyed so much. There are very few wasted words and filler, thus there is not a dull moment. It is extremely well written by Julian Fellowes and you care for or dislike every character, which is completely fleshed out in their goodness and wickedness alike. To top that off, there are historical facts throughout the series which are very accurate. Elizabeth McGovern does a wonderful job as the American wife of an English Heir. Maggie Smith reigns as the Queen of the double take and is so funny in her candidness of situations. From the sinking of the Titanic in the first episode, to the cliff hanger in the last of Season Three.....This is the most exquisite series on the market today....hands down...EXCELLENT!
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|I definitely enjoyed the album. I just wish there were some slow songs on it. Other than that it was good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game and I am not usually very into video games! Very challenging to me and my daughters ages 24...22...and 16 enjoy it as well!
0553801473|5.0|The whole series is worth a read!  This is one of the more interesting books in the series.  Recommend to anyone!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Needed to read this to clarify some parts of the Movie.  Almost exactly like the movie except for a few key differneces.  It helped clarify the intent of the &#34;So it is with religion&#34; comment.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|I love this movie which is why I purchased it as a gift for my daughter.  When it arrived, the case had a dent in each corner and a crease along the edge.  It looked like a used item that was rewrapped.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Suspensful--  A good story line with enough factual and historical refernces to be plausible.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I would give it give stars but I can't find all the bananas.  It is a great game to just relax and not think too much...unless you want to get them piggies.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Fun to read, a bit rushed at the end, but still very interesting.  I will read the rest of the quintet
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton once again did not disappoint me with this novel.  Her story-telling and attention-to-detail is amazing and thorough.  The way she built the characters, especially the selfish mother, made me feel like I was one of the help in the house watching everything unfold.  I love the way Kate uses stories within stories in her books.  I won't go into detail about the story but I will say, I couldn't put the book down and the characters took hold of my heart.  This is a must read for historical fiction lovers who also love family secrets and seeing what happened in the past to bring you to the present.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Don't start watching it or you won&#34;t be able to quit. We bought all five season<br />and so far have been very satisified.
B00454U1NS|4.0|I enjoy Pink.  She appeals to many different audiences.  I purchase most of my music on Amazon for the convenience and price.
B004LUS390|4.0|From what little playing I've had the chance to do, it will be a lot of fun.  So far, so good.
1410445224|4.0|I haven't had the opportunity to read this book yet, but I know it did get good reviews.  It will be on my winter read this year.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is the most Addictive game I have ever played and my sister loves down loading i love this game
B002UZ5J72|5.0|Written in easy reading language this book makes for a great read for grown ups as well as kids. And inspires to know God more.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I really enjoy this album. At first, I didn't understand the hype about alt-J, but now I definitely can dig it. Solid album overall. Their vocals are absolutely amazing, and the stripped-down approach to some of their songs is excellent.
1416550550|5.0|When I finished the book, my first thought was that it would make an awesome movie. The descriptions transported me to the various  places and I could visualize myself being there. The plot was well conceived and wonderfully rendered.
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|This game makes absolutely no sense! Thank gosh that I got for free because if I paid for it then I would have just wasted my money! I DON'T recommend this app to anyone!!!!! Don't buy this! :-( such a waste.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|your racing a mionion. so you can get a trougfhy its awesome you should play it. its the best game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Lots of twists and turns.  At the end, I felt like I had finished a very emotional roller-coaster.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its like a real live horse. Its so much fun to ride, train, feed, and do other stuff. Its so cool you need to try this app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book and found it interesting, but my prevailing thought throughout was that it was written to become a movie screen play.  Guess what?
B004VMVTNU|5.0|No complaints.  Math solving is both unique and effective! Would recommend to those who don't mind the app's otherwise outdated color scheme and appearance.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|Weirdo creepy bunch of inbreds- trashy trailer type people.  Ick.  Plot stinks, too. Don't bother. A freak show...with no plot.
044024613X|5.0|The son in a small family may have committed a terrible crime and is on trial. This story tells of the emotional struggle by his<br />parents to find the truth.
B000W1TIN2|5.0|I marvel at the beauty of this music and can't get enough of their albums.  Sigur Ros has become one of my favorite bands and I don't understand a word of their lyrics!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I'm very happy with the new &#34;Alice in Chains&#34; and their direction as a group.<br /><br />some great music to be found in this album and look forward to their next project
0525478817|5.0|I rarely give a book 5 stars, because nothing is perfect, right? This book is as close as it gets. The dialogue is amazing. I want to be like these teenagers. I want them to be my friends. They are amazing, in so, so many ways.<br /><br />My daughter forced me to read this book. I hadn't because of the hype (I tend to scoff at hype). She warned me that it was sad (I did NOT cry, however, but that's probably because I am a curmudgeon). It is. It is very sad. It is also joyous, brilliant and celebratory.<br /><br />This may be my favorite book of the year.
0345803485|1.0|I DON;T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT THIS BOOK, I FOUND IT BORING, REPETITIVE AND POORLY WRITTEN.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Item arrived quickly, and was exactly as depicted. Works as advertised and then some. I love this MP3 player. I can finally keep my ears plugged from water yet listen to music and podcasts while swimming. There are a few limitations with loading media and lacks features found on full fledged players but hey, it works, sounds great and stays dry ! Quality item. I would recommend this product. All it needs to be awesome is track forward and reverse, and varied playback speed for listening to podcasts quicker but other than that I love it !
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the greatest game I have ever played I was pretty slow at growing the sharks then after I saw the megalodon
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I heard about the series and thought I would try it.  I have enjoyed the 3 seasons. Spoiler alert!!  I am NOT happy with how season 3 ended!!  I realize this is a 'soap opera' of sorts, but enough with 'Lady Mary's' tragedies...
B00C7KXUOE|2.0|Of course that's what the story would be about but it's over the top for me.  The filming is excellent and the acting is very good.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love how gameloft put all of this action and adventure into one really cool game. Beware, this game is addicting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the period of this show and think all the characters are fantastic especially Maggie Smith and the butler. Now that Matthew is dead I wonder how they will work it out.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|I have watched this movie 8 or 9 times and I still enjoy it. Fun characters and great music. Love the Frog Brothers and Grandpa.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love all the different options you can use for sounds, and that you can fade some to just be a light background to others. I use heavy rain, chanting, and earth. My hubby can't sleep without it!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this book, but I truly loved it.  The characters, the story, I fell in love with everything about it.  I couldn't put it down and in the end wanted more.  Truly a fantastic book.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|One way or another, this film will not turn out as you expect. I give SIDE EFFECTS four stars because it's absolutely gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed with lots of nice, subtle complications. Despite certain structural flaws, this is one of the few films I'd like to watch again in the near future. The loaded dialogue--e.g., \\"Depression is the inability to construct a future\\"--is meaningful to the ultimate theme of the film. Some sex and violence, but it's tasteful regarding what it shows and does not show. SIDE EFFECTS is NOT just all about wacky prescription drugs and should have much appeal to crime thriller/suspense fans.<br /><br />Some people obviously like the big twists toward the end, but some obviously don't, and I'm more in the latter category. SIDE EFFECTS departs a little too abruptly from its original premise and storyline. Many of the turnabouts are tacked on too neatly and executed too easily. Rooney Mara does a fine job of playing troubled Emily Taylor, but the same sudden shift her character makes with all the other elements of the film renders her motivations a little hard to understand. Still, the very lack of predictability creates a riveting ride. While a bit sensational and not exactly complimentary, SIDE EFFECTS is also very illuminating of the medical profession and pharmaceutical industry. I do not see anything inherently misogynistic about the film-in-general, but I can see why many women might take exception to how it unravels.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|Just an addition to a case mod that I did. Comes with a lot of cables for connectivity which is great. quietest little fan I could find. tad pricey but noctua doesn't mess around with quality
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I quite enjoyed this read.  It was a peaceful, calm read, just perfect for my frayed nerves.  The Irish setting is lovely.  I would recommend this, especially for someone like me, who has an incredibly busy life and finds it hard to get into a demanding book.
B0090SI582|4.0|\\"The Wolverine\\" ALMOST goes full retard in the last twenty minutes, but the 100 minutes preceding that are really solid. In fact, this movie was a solid 9 before the last stupid twenty minutes. Still, the Ronin aspect of the first two acts was fantastic. I love a good samurai tale, and this really hit it off the park. Kinda like how Skyfall was a character study of 007, this is a character study of Logan. I mean, this is not as good, but it still ends up being solid. The action progresses the story, and the set pieces are awesome yet subtle...until the last act. A chase during a funeral, a fight on a bullet train, and an epic samurai fight at the end of the second act were the highlights. There was just enough action for me. It was really the talking that engrossed me. Wolvy's interaction with his \\"bodyguard\\" Yukio were great and the love interest Mariko were not cheesy at all. I liked how the mortality aspect was a big subplot rather than the whole thing, because it never got boring. The actual story was decent with the whole Yakuza thing going on, but the last act kind of cheapened some of the story. Damn it, you last twenty minutes! It's not like the finale was horrible like the finale of Origins, but it was kind of dumb. Seriously, the finale should have been the showdown with arrows that comes RIGHT before it. The rest should have been as serious as the rest of it. It left kind of a bad tase, but still, this movie is TWO hours. So if the first 100 minutes were a solid 9.5, and the finale was kind of a 6, it didn't bother me as much. Plus, the end teaser was great! So pumped for Days of Future Past! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\"The Wolverine\\" earns a solid 8.5/10
B00BQ83TMG|5.0|A truly great historical fiction writer ! He keeps you spellbound thorough is literature.<br />A must read for anyone who enjoys history !
B00755MHXG|5.0|This book is full of wonders. I was moved to tears while reading it. I gave it to my daughter who is a schoolteacher and she said that while reading it, she wished it would never end.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Really cool game with nice graphics and hilarious monologues. Kind of short of you just do the missions. Once I saw I was 50%+ finished, I started exploring and justifying my gangsta throughout Rio. Lol! The weapons and other upgrades are entirely too expensive but if you are playing Gameloft, you are PAYING Gameloft.
014241543X|5.0|This is truly one of the best books that I have ever read.  Beautiful, poignant, elegant in its simplicity! The writing can be almost visceral, which at times is heartbreaking, but always inviting you to turn the next page.  And turn the next page you will until you finish the book.  The best books are the ones that change your life.  This was one of those rare books for me.  I would read anything this author writes.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|You can't go wrong with a Ryan Gosling movie! Really cute and occasionally funny. Worth Checking out!<br />Crazy Stupid Love
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Great book... Keeps you guessing until the end. It is a book worth reading and keeps to the James Rollins style.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I picked up 2 Chromecasts from a local big box retailer (you know the one...I was able to still get my free 3 months of Netflix that way), and Google has a sure-fire hit on their hands. I'm going to take some time to both review the product, and to fully explain the pros and cons.<br /><br />Before you purchase one, please make sure you have either: an Android phone or tablet (running 2.3 Gingerbread or higher), Windows PC (running Windows 7 or higher), or a Mac (running OS X 10.7 Lion or higher), or a Chromebook Pixel (running Chrome 28 or higher). You will need this to setup the device. That device will ALSO need to have access to the same WiFi network the Chromecast will be connecting to. This means you can't do the initial setup from a PC or Mac that only has an ethernet connection. While the device can currently be operated by an iOS device, there currently isn't a setup app available for iOS devices. Expect Google to remedy this very soon.<br /><br />The dongle has two ports: one in the front to plug into an HDMI port on your tv, and one in the rear for microUSB power. Yes, the Chromecast needs to be powered (like any other streaming device). On newer tv's that FULLY implement the HDMI 1.4 spec, the port will power the Chromecast by itself. On tv's that don't, you will need to use the USB cable. If your tv has a USB port (the port MUST be labeled USB or have the USB logo...ones that say \\"service\\" are not powered ports) then simply connect the cord to that to power the device. If not, Google still has you covered: they include a pretty standard 850mA USB power adapter to plug into a wall socket. Also included is an HDMI extender cable. This may be useful to you if your tv is wall mounted or very close to it, and the HDMI port sticks straight out towards it.<br /><br />The setup program is straightforward and simple....very easy to use regardless of platform. You turn on your tv, and tune to the input source it's connected to. Your tv will display a \\"set me up\\"screen with the WiFi name of the Chromecast dongle. You go to Google's website (listed on the screen and on the packaging), download the setup app, and follow the instructions. I would hazard a VERY educated guess that the reason iOS doesn't have a setup app yet is because the process for iOS would break this very simple process, since Apple won't allow downloading apps from Chrome. The app would have to be approved by Apple, and hosted in the iOS App Store. Follow the few steps, let the program find the Chromecast (if you have more than one it will find them all at one time!), verify your codes on your tv's, and voila! You are done....well, almost. If you are using a PC or Mac, you will also be prompted to add the Google Cast extension to Chrome, which will allow you to cast any open tab to the device.<br /><br />It may be impossible to make a streaming device that is easier to use than this...PERIOD. There essentially IS NO UI. After initial setup, anytime you are in an app that supports casting AND on the same WiFi network, you will see a square icon (with a small WiFi icon in the corner of it) appear. That's the \\"Casts\\" icon, and all you have to do is click it to send the video or audio (or Chrome tab on a PC/Mac) to any Chromecast dongle on that same home network. A menu will appear asking you which device you want to send it to. Select which device, wait a second or two, and you are streaming. It's literally that simple. After the dongle starts streaming the device you used to start the cast can be used as a remote to control the cast. 2 great things about this compared to other alternative products: 1) no remotes to lose or learn in addition to the many remotes you already have. 2) the remote control functionality is separate from the streaming. The Chromecast streams for itself over your WiFi internet connection, NOT FROM YOUR PHONE/TABLET/PC/MAC. You can minimize the remote control window, use that device to do other things, etc. and it will have no impacton the video or music being streamed.<br /><br />The Chromecast will automatically stream at the native resolution of the display it's connected to, so if your tv is 1080p you had better make sure you have a fast enough internet connection. Folks with 6-10Mbps connections who think their connections are \\"fast\\" will be in for a rude awakening. My 50Mbps connection allows flawless 1080p streaming even with other devices downloading on the network at the same time, but 20Mbps should work just fine in that scenario as well. If your connection is too slow, get ready to deal with buffering and stuttering.<br /><br />I am currently using the device for Netflix, Google All Access Music, YouTube, and tabs in Chrome. There currently aren't many services compatible yet, but due to Google publishing all of the APIs so companies can make their apps compatible I'd expect many of them to get on the bandwagon very soon. HBOGo and Pandora should be on deck very shortly. Services that currently aren't can always be streamed from a tab (hint), but some of them still don't work well (Silverlight) since when the video is maximized it essentially is in a tab different than the one you selected to cast from.<br /><br />All in all, this device is a steal. There are devices that can do more, and devices that support more services (for now), but there is no device on the market as simple to use and as inexpensive as the Chromecast. The phenomenal video quality (and the free 3 months of Netflix if you bought one quickly enough) is just the icing on the cake. At $35, there literally is little reason NOT to buy one...or more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I might be money but its worth it! if you play it on the computer it is the same but not all the way updated but just get the awesome app
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I think it's a fun story line & good show. Sometimes the British accent goes in and out a little bit but not enough to take away from her character. Especially considering she is switching to the other clone characters and accents too. Hope the future seasons continue to be entertaining.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Pretty violent (and graphically so ...) and the &#34;N&#34; word used by blacks and whites alike, but Jamie Foxx was excellent, so was the actor who played the Dr. Schultz character (this actor was also excellent in the movie, &#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34;).<br /><br />Good to the very last! But bloody, very bloody ...
B00005B1W7|5.0|We hadn't watched this movie in many years but remembered enjoying it back then.  It is just as good today as it was when we first saw it.  It has mystery, compassion, passion and an excellent story line say nothing of excellent actors.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|What a great story and the kids love watching it. Caught myself watching it by myself after the kids went to bed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very well written. Great story of broken, lost, rekindled, forgotten relationships. We read this for our book club. Can't wait to discuss it with the other members!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive!  Not hard enough to frustrate, but hard enough to keep you thinking.  I couldn't put it down!  Can't wait for more!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Bought this app for my Kindle and it is SOOOOOOOOO much fun. The daily challenge is so fun. You have to get letters to complete a word and earn a prize. So fun I TELL YOU. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Excellent music that you remember from the movie, now with fewer Kaiju roars.<br />Honestly an great soundtrack with incredible variation and drive.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I would give this a five if you could upload a pic from kindle photo or another site to serve as a banner on your page. I have tried multiple ways, and cannot do it. Could be me, but I can't see how. Otherwise, works great!
B004J4WL50|2.0|I thought this would be a interesting read.<br />Not so. Not much new is discovered with the read. I got this as a Kindle book.<br />My 2 cents, do not waste your time.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very fun to play many rooms to pick from.  Wish more of my friends played. Bingo is one of my favorite games.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Like most horror movies, it starts off kind of cool and scarey, but inevitably it ends with our lady hero inserting a chain saw into the head of the demon and saying something very obligatory and very trite:  Here's blood in your eye, m-f-er!!! or something equally as stupid and forgettable.  It's as if Hollywood follows some sort of template, or something.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Its soo awesome because u can talk to more than one person at a time. So u can't go back and forth, u can stay on the one person.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We have watched this since it came on the air. Each show builds and twists on previous episodes in interesting and exciting ways. They tie each and every character to storybook characters and fairy tales is wonderful.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|This cute, quick read is very different to say the least. There was a comfort to it however. Not just in the creatures, but in the story. I felt like I was in a new aged Alice in Wonderland. It was a bit jumpy. I still found it easy to follow, but I had hoped for a bit more. But for a short story, that is the usual only complaint right? At least as far as the ones that I have read goes.<br /><br />\\"The aroma you are enquiring upon is me, and you get used to it after a while,\\" he said, wiping a stale chicken under his armpit. \\" Now that little snippet made me giggle. Moving on...<br /><br />What more can I say? Inventive, tables that are giant turtles, I mean, imagination spilled all over this short story. (Hence my craving for it to be longer.)<br />I say take a chance, and remember... Don't put your feet in the lava! (You'll understand that bit when you read the book.) When you read, you will find 'a place of knowing.'<br />Bravo!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Thhhhh....  (that's a raspberry).  Tried to sign in, couldn't.  I wanted to identify pictures to sign in.  Couldn't.  I tried to answer the security question.  Couldn't.  Would have liked to give more stars.  Couldn't.
B008Y73940|5.0|It held us from start to finish.  Good movie, good acting. If you like John Grisham, you'll like this movie.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Was using The Weather Channel Application. We like this one much more.  Need more time to assess value of it.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I won't give a review of the episodes, as that really belongs elsewhere, in my opinion.  What I will say is that this update to the beloved franchise is superb.  I very much enjoy seeing things look much sharper, with the effects cleaned up and even re-created in some cases.  Colors are more vibrant and true to life and the extra features are a very welcome addition.  It seems that even all of the previous DVD special features were all preserved, as well.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a complaint at all, I would say that I'd love to hear more commentaries.  If each episode had a director's commentary, I'd be in heaven.  But, this not being a perfect world, I will not dock it any stars because of this fantasy.  :~)
B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie is decent and you will probably enjoy it if you haven't read the book.  I think it was impossible to translate effectively.
B001TH16DI|3.0|I have not watched all of the films in this collection yet, but what I have seen shows me that they did not bring in anything from the &#34;Director's Edition&#34; nor &#34;Special Collector's Edition&#34; of the films.  These are straight, film to Blu-ray transfers of the theatrical release of each film.  That, in itself, is enough for me to dock it two stars.  I may come back and edit this review (if that's even possible) after I've had a chance to finish watching of the films in this collection as well as the special bonuses, such as the Captains Summit.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Funny, witty, charming, great characters, filled with pop-culture references. My favorite TV show of all time. Wish there were more special features. The gilmore-isms are great.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|I like how he gives lots of examples to illustrate and summarizes in actionable bullets. Just wish it was shorter and condensed into a dozen pages.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Funny, witty, charming, great characters, filled with pop-culture references. My favorite TV show of all time. Wish there were more special features. The gilmore-isms are great.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Finally got around to watching this movie after all these years - love this series by Nicholas Sparks - especially the NC connection being a Tarheel... but some of his movies are not authentic to NC coast (I recall one with rocks jutting out of the water everywhere - not sure which one) but overall, a great series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There is a glitch for me on level 7... it seems that no one else is getting this glitch.... it is that whenever I click on something to find a clue... it automatically goes to the computer desk and doesn't let me go back.... SO FRUSTERATING... I'm going to redownload the app and hope that the glitch is gone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicting. Simple yet fun. Doesn't aggravate you to buy in app purchases all the time. Play it with my kids a lot
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I'm not particularly adept at this type of puzzle game so I bruised a few brain cells before I was done but I really enjoyed it.  Challenging &amp; rewarding!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like temple run then you should like this this game is fun and kids should love this game it is a great game one of the best  I have plausible ad every time my cousins ask to play it they always want to play the game so I Jasmine just want to say this is a good game
B003VANOFY|4.0|Excellent sound quality, decent range, wireless is just perfect!<br /><br />Easy controls and functionalities. Fit my head nicely and sound isolated work wonders.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was a wonderful story that I believe  really happened, back in the day, unfortunately.  I laughed and cried through out my reading.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|This app is a great way to access your Steam account and check in with your friends when you are on the go.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first in this series captivated me.... amazing!!! I started the second in the series and either due to slow progression or maybe just the distraction of my 10 month old baby I put it down. Then, odd to me, as I normally don't restart a book.... A month later I picked it back up. Part three had me on the edge of my seat.... and it only got better from there. I just stayed up most of the night to finish the last in this series. Hugh, you said you read every amazon post on your book so if that's true... You've got a standing dinner invitation in Washington, D.C.  Your now on my list to meet with Olson Scott Card and the other incredible writers who help me and my family dream big. thank you for such a strong female lead. Write the next one please!!!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Can you beat a movie with Will Smith, James Earl Jones and Josh Brolin?  Besides the silly, there is a nice touch of the personal and I always like a good story.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The camera connection kit  works great with my SD cards and iPad but is not compatible with the iPod 4th or 5th generation.  I'm hoping that will be remedied when iOS 7 is implemented.  I find it very handy emailing photos directly from my iPad without going through my PC.  As long as one isn't looking to email photos from an SD card via  an iPod I would recommend this accessories to anyone.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|I'd call this a sleeper; though at first it got good reviews, it seemed to wither.  But it deserves a second look.  Clooney at his best.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Ran across one of her videos on youtube and immediately fell in love with her music. Downloaded the entire album for 8.99!
B0061US58C|5.0|This is a fun family movie that the kids in us all would enjoy. If you haven't seen it yet go out and get it!
B00633W614|4.0|A great read. The plot draws you in,. Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller. I thorougly enjoyed the book/
B004DLPXAO|5.0|What can I say.......I love it. Kindle for everyone!!! All platforms have it and that is great. This makes it convenient for reading where ever you are.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Takes awhile to get going, but pretty fun once you do.  Tries to get you to buy currency though. That's the reason it lost two stars.
1619699826|5.0|I enjoyed Angels Flight because it had a lot of action.<br /><br />I always like Harry Bosch and all of the characters in his books.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Action was cool!  Characters were right on!  Enjoyable for all kids and their parents too!  Read it together for more fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. It is a million times better then temple run and a lot easier too.
B000BMYWYC|4.0|Not much more to say than that.  It works very well.  Great for seems.  Smell is a little strong. Use in ventilated area.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I loved this book. I started reading this series and cant stop. always looking forward to the next in the series
B00D8UOE5G|5.0|I think it's easy to often brush off the children of major stars who then go into the entertainment/fashion industries as merely skating by off of their parent's cred. That being said, I think it's important to realize that sometimes the very same things that can drive the parent to success can be present and burn furiously in the child. Sting's daughter Coco is a perfect example of someone who clearly inherited talent, but then put their own unique spin on it. And as for the children of two artists who then grow up in an environment full of other artists and creators, on top of often having frequently turbulent and unusual childhoods--it's not surprising that they can be capable of real magic if they can just harness all of that talent, experience and emotion.<br /><br />I believe that Lou Doillon is one of these artists. Her family is practically French royalty (mother singer/actress/fashion muse Jane Birkin, father acclaimed filmmaker Jacques Doillon, sister actress/singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and her sister's father iconic singer Serge Gainsbourg was also a constant presence). Lou herself acted in numerous films starting from a young age, but she always felt sort of the odd man out in her very famous extraordinarily talented family. At age nineteen a cousin who she was very close to was tragically killed, and she also became pregnant by a man who soon left her. Afterwards, her life dramatically changed and she became something of a recluse for about 10 years--that is until a friend of her mother's heard some of her music and convinced her to record it. In 2013, Lou won the French equivalent of the Grammys for female artist of the year for her debut album, shocking just about everyone.<br /><br />\\"Places\\" is the type of achingly confessional folk music along the lines of artists like Cat Power and Leonard Cohen with definite influences of second father figure Serge. It's intensely honest and personal, yet the delivery is quite often dispassionate almost like Lou is singing as an observer to her life and not as the star actor. She sings in very measured tones, practically speaking sometimes-definitely speaking on brilliant title track \\"Places\\". Her strength in songwriting comes from her ability to paint scenes not always with physical details but sometimes with emotions. At times these scenes are so vivid and palpable that you are find yourself immersed in them, able to perfectly relate them to your own experiences. And so Lou sets the scene for you to relive some of the most difficult and hard to accept truths about your own life by opening up about her own life.<br /><br />Now every song doesn't achieve a magnetic connection, and on these few misses--the songs end up just being boring and rather tedious. And honestly, I imagine that's how a lot of people will hear this record. Unless the lyrics speak to you, the music is not going to entice you to stay. It's either an emotional introspective journey or monotone drivel depending on the listener. Both viewpoints can be entirely accurate. Lou doesn't have the type of standout technical talent say of someone like Mariah Carey who most people may or may not enjoy but will agree on her tremendous voice and vocal range. Either you believe Lou and are swept into her perspective of the world which may give clarity into your own world, or this album will come across as excessively self indulgent.<br /><br />On a side note--Lou speaks/sings impeccable English, so understanding her lyrics is never a concern. Also, Soko's  [[ASIN:B00B0NG1FE I Thought I Was An Alien]] reminds me as a more sarcastic and funny version of Lou. My two favorite songs aside from \\"Places\\" are the upbeat and layered with jazz touches \\"Questions and Answers\\" and the softly lilting \\"Same Old Game\\". If artists like Power, Cohen, Buckley, and Mitchell get you excited--then I would definitely recommend spending the time to get to know Lou.is singing as an observer to her life and not as the star actor.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Always loved the original series.  It is something about the original cast that just does it for me.  To see Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock again was a real treat.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|Russell Crow is once again wonderful in this movie. Very moving, and he gives as good as he gets. Very unnerving to think that this was probably how is was in the day of the gladiators! How awful that people were used this way for amusement!  A &#34; must see &#34; movie!
B002NPUCIA|5.0|I have been listening to Brian for a long time.  I recently saw his live show and was blown away with the way he commanded the stage.  The way he can make just one note sound is simply amazing.  Keep doing what you're doing and I will keep buying your music.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|Even at my age ( and I'm no kid ) this was too cute. One of the better kid's movies, yet great for the whole family. I've watched it more than once and I still get a kick out of it!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good product, but nobody wants to by content from Google Play when we have already built up our libraries through amazon and itunes. Also, the media selection is way better on amazon and itunes. Just do yourself a favor and pay a little more for the better experience of a Roku or Apple TV. That is all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book came highly recommended and I, having finished it, agree. The author does an amazing job of introducing a character only to slap you in the face later with their true persona. Love the ending...though I'm not sure I can call it that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Was really fun and actually very worth the buy! All the puzzles were made to make you actually think and work for the solutions!
B0026IUXO2|4.0|good acting, glad I rented and not spent a fortune at the theater.  better movies to watch in the theater..
B00243FQFA|5.0|I bought this because it was the only one I didn't have in my collection. Wished they didn't cancel the show.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Enjoyed the movie! Entertaining! Packed full of action. If thats your kind of movie then a must see...Great cast. ..ready for Red 2 now.

B0069UP2PI|4.0|I use this in a health class, students enjoy it. Works well with chapter on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS. Outbreak is also a good movie.

B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|How I love Kanye West new album. I love the beats and style of the album. Not better than his first three,but one of his best.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|An entertaining game.  By choosing to use or not use the hint and skip buttons, you can make it as difficult or easy as you want.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I had tried the nostromo game pad for steelseries and did not like it at all.  I could name numerous things wrong with that one. So let just say that the g13 is everything the nostromo is not.  So if your compairing the 2, trust me ... this one is far superior,  solid, stays put and comfortable.<br /><br />The only thing wrong with the g13 has nothing to do with it only our abitity to adjust to having to move your fingers in a more tight pattern from that of a keyboard ...not a big problem there right guys<br /><br />I recommend this to all you gamers out there that want to take your game to a higher level of comfort and precision
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was the best ever I love how u can compete and how u can make the food for the  horse I have to say this is a pretty cool game
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|The intense nature of the score, the thunderous and rawness of the orchestral instruments and of of course the mental imagery from the film make this a superb soundtrack to own.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Very happy with this. I don't usually leave feedback but I was very impressed. VERY VERY EASY TO WORK WITH!!!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|One of the best movies ever..true story, showing what CAN be done at great risk, by people who care..I would recommend this to anyone who loves good espionage stories..especially true stories..GOOD SHOW, AFFLECK!!  RDS
B005K17RU0|4.0|The map doesn't seem to animate well for me, but maybe my connection. However, overall I like the app. If the map animated, I'd give 5 stars.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is even better than their current Some Nights.  I love every song on the album!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|My son is a commercial pilot and he's done this work for many years.  Watching this DVD helped me understand his work a little better even though he would never do what's portrayed here.  It's an interesting movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook is constantly updating and making itself more glitchy and more complicated.  Facebook has gotten to a point where you can just simply do too much on it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Best Picture Oscar & Best Actor Oscar are clearly well deserved.  This is that rare film these days-simply excellent!<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br /><br />\\"At the 83rd Academy Awards, The King's Speech won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler). The film had received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year. Besides the four categories it won, the film received nominations for Best Cinematography (Danny Cohen) and two for the supporting actors (Bonham Carter and Rush), as well as two for its mise-en-sc&egrave;ne: Art Direction and Costumes.\\"

B0052GACNM|5.0|I love listening to the  CD while driving around it helps to keep focus in heavy traffic.  very glad I made the purchase
B000002O1P|5.0|Tom and the band got back to their roots on this release.  They also brought in Dave Stewart of The Eurythmics, to produce on their 6th studio offering \\"Southern Accents\\".  \\"Rebels\\", is a stunning track, this one should of hit the 40, can't beat this one.  The funky-rocker \\"It Ain't Nothin' To Me\\", this tune brought in the horns.  Their top 15 hit, the psychedelic \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\".  The soulful title track, the r&b sounding \\"Make It Better (Forget About Me)\\", love the classic \\"Spike\\", the rolling \\"Dogs On The Run\\", this is classic Tom Petty, should be played on radio all over this land!  The wistful \\"Mary's New Car\\" and the reflective \\"The Best Of Everything\\".  This kind of a lost Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, good stuff, now time for a remaster.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Beautiful art work, with tough puzzles... unfortunately by the time you get the hang of it, it's over. Some of the puzzles need fine tuning due to jerky movement and are difficult to open, even when lined up. Over all fun game.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Pretty good app so far although haven't had long. Wanted Bloglovin as I have on my iPhone but they didn't offer it for the Fire. Finally found this app & it's been good so far. It'd be nice if it was easier to find & add blogs like you can on Bloglovin but once I figured it out its been good!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really good for horse lovers like me! I recommend this horse interaction for everyone who loves horses

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My husband and I first watched Suits on amazon. We watched the very first episode and thought it okay but after the second episode, we were hooked! Suits is our new favorite show to watch.
B00168HARG|5.0|Love it.  Female lead could not have done a better job.  She was fearless and crazy, which is what Sarah Connor really was.  I think they stopped the show at the ultimate point where their fans were finally coming together thinking \\"Gosh, this is getting good, give me some more\\" and then they do the amazing thing about sending John into the future and nobody knows him and the story ends?????  WTH<br />This could Have gone on for several more seasons with what ifs???  So sorry to see it go.  Had a good cast, killed off some good cast, but I like that sometimes you have to be realistic and somebody has to die - nobody lives for ever.<br /><br />Sorry to see it go - maybe they can come back with ah on-line version like Sanctuary started out and we  can pay to see the next episodes and the end.  What an ending it could be.<br /><br />Rita
B006GECE9Y|1.0|After research on how to be able to view videos and online live events with this app, found out later that it does not work. Amazon it would be great if you would come up with something compatable for the kindlefire 7 hd in order for your product to be an excellent one. Thank you in advance.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is for the patient watcher who likes a story to be told throughout the season. Once you get over the gore, you can appreciate this psychological thriller for what it is: really messed up. This show is darker than Dexter and yet you still feel a little sympathy for the lead psychopath.
1594204217|5.0|I do not buy many books any more.  But, I bought two copies of Cooked, one for me and one for a daughter.<br /><br />He brings together excellent narrative that is fun to read, deeper insight into each topic he addresses, and linkage to associated issues.<br /><br />In this case his review of fire, water, air and water goes into practical experience he gains on each topic as well as the science of what is happening in each case.  He makes cooking a great deal more then putting a meal on the table.  How does cooking fit with man's evolution,what is happening inside the thing we are cooking as well as what is happening inside us when we eat it.<br /><br />If you cook, read Cooked,  If you cook, read Cooked. And if you just want a good story, read Cooked

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because its better than temple run. I also like it because it has minions. The minions are my favorite part of this game.

B007SGM084|5.0|Great books to read but I was hoping that the third book would have gone into a fourth. So much more info on the characters to know and she jumped into the future and jumped around. Let's hear about Taylor's daughter, Kate's marriage and birth o  her baby. How close is the gray family now? What about Mao and Ethan? I want to hear about those stories!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Great game! But if you guys want that last star you guys need t  add multiplayer!!!! But other then that, this game is amzing!!!!
B000OONQ9O|5.0|This isn't a dvd review of the movie I already read how it was changed. You have to go into your closet & get out the laserdisc or vhs player to see the original. I just bought the laserdisc which was made in 1981 even though there was a bit of speckles it had a fairly good picture to it.

B008Q0AZVK|3.0|An outright cad, Georges (Robert Pattinson) sleeps his way to the top of his debauched Parisian society searching for something, perhaps security, that he is not capable of recognizing.  A little slow and stiff initially -due to a lack of content- but ultimately surprisingly satisfying.  Winning and loosing are opposing sides of the same coin. Uma Thurman is almost unrecognizable as she literally becomes her character, Georges spouse. Christina Ricci playing one of his lovers provides the heart of the movie and her character helps us see the elusive softer side of Georges while Colin Meaney provides his usual strong presence. Kristin Scott Thomas as the older lover who is most clearly a pawn in this chess game gives a great performance too.  Pattinson, holding his own while surrounded by true artists, introduces us to a character with few if any redeeming characteristics -- yet we still want to like him.  Worth watching!!
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Ok I watched this when it first came out and thought it wasn't to bad. I enjoy fantasy film and when you add some stoner humor it just makes it better. I was a little nervous buying this film because I couldn't really remember it and my Girlfriend had never seen it so I was like ok I'll get it, it's affordable so why not. I bought it and my girlfriend was like I don't know if I'll like it, (She didn't like Pineapple Express, Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter) needless to say we laughed our asses off and she said Good Choice I really enjoyed it. So I definitly recommend this but if you have no sense of humor then don't waste your time because then you'll trash this movie and bring it down. It's nothing amazing but it is a good comedy.

B007V65R54|5.0|Having a lot of data about some phenomenon promotes faster knowledge acquisition and more accurate prediction, right? Apparently not!<br /><br />The author presents compelling arguments about how increasing the amount of data can make the signal less representative among the noise, slowing knowledge acquisition and our ability to predict systems behavior. To make things more interesting, signal varies according to physical domains (it is easier to gain knowledge about electrical behavior of graphene layers than seismic activity caused by tectonic plates movement), for various reasons.<br /><br />I was especially impressed by Nate Silver’s arguments about Big Data, which is expected to promote data-driven predictions. The trap is that, by making data exploration too easy, researchers will be inclined to neglect their role in the knowledge acquisition process.<br /><br />In this probabilistic world of ours, making things the old way is sometimes better.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Give this thing a few listens before you judge. Go to philanselmo.com and stream it from the player while reading the lyrics page. Phil is a student of music and did not just throw a bunch of random stuff out to piss people off. This was a calculated effort. It is not Pantera... but many Pantera fans will recognize some of the elements. There are moments on this album that could have been what Pantera might have morphed into had they kept it together. Most remember Pantera's power but many forget how much they experimented. Gotta hand it to Phil for pulling this stunt instead of going for the easy cash grab. This album breaks new ground for Phil and for metal. He's done it again.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Most of us learn somehow that one effective way to understand things in nature is to identify relationships between things (phenomena) and create simpler, linear models that would fit into our human cognitive “platform”. Somehow, reductionism is culturally pervasive nowadays, even among uneducated people.<br /><br />Despite I read before about human cognitive bias, chaos and adaptive systems theory, and challenges in prediction for some domains, this is the first time I read a compelling narrative that was able to relate concepts from all of those fields, and describe how “linear thinking” can be detrimental to understanding and control, how natural systems embed a not-always-symmetrical “double-entry” accounting and why this is of utmost importance to everyone.<br /><br />The author argues that reductionism is a kind of double trap, because 1) it gave us a false perception of control, by giving us a incomplete sense of understanding complexity; 2) it obliterates the causal relationship between “black swan” events (like stock market crashes) and the fragile man-made arrangement among system components (banker makes money whatever investor bets turn out; however, it may be a matter of time until investors get out of business, supply chain is affected by lower demand, companies fail to honor bank payments, which makes more investments funds flatten, and the stage is set for a tragic collapse – Mr Taleb explains it much more convincingly than me).<br /><br />Although there is a lot in the text I would get rid of (for the sake of clarity), it has been a privilege to read this book. So, do not read this book.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|I've seen two Capote movies and I loved both of them. But this one shows the effect that the execution had on Capote. Its like the experience drained him to the point of no return. If anyone gets a chance, see the other one also. Sorry, but I don't remember the full title, but I'm sure Amazon has it in their library.
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|Terrible!!! Doesn't make any sense. Horror scenes and special effects can't even keep you awake. Maybe with the right dose of cannabis, this film can be enjoyed...
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It is said that at the age of seven, a young boy starts to become truly self aware; aware of the consequences of his actions in the society around him.  This is a wonderful coming of age story, right at the cusp of sexuality, but not quite there yet.  His mentor is a female just a few years older than he, but apparently also several millennia older too. And in that is the fantastic twist. A quick and engrossing read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game. Any fan of the movie or the 'minion' will surely enjoy!! Go get some bananas!
B00571F26Y|3.0|Some interesting information for weight loss. I had a buddy lose 30 lbs in six months on this diet. Was concerned about the reaction if reintroducing gluten back into the diet.
B00AEFXWF6|5.0|Great print and worth the money, can't go wrong buying this BD! A step up from the old DVD from yesteryear
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|After slogging through all 140 hours (whatever) of the extended &#34;Lord of the Rings,&#34; I avoided &#34;The Hobbit&#34; in theaters.  Yes, it is too long.  No, it really doesn't need to be a trilogy.  But the 3D is excellent (almost as good as &#34;Hugo&#34;) and I actually enjoyed it more on the 2nd and 3rd viewings.  Martin Freeman, I thought, was an odd choice as Bilbo.  Until about 10 minutes into the movie.  Freeman was brilliant casting, and his performance is a revelation.  His expressions and reactions establish the character and enhance the viewing. The performance is so good it almost makes up for the clunky pacing: a couple of minutes of walking, a couple minutes of talking, a few minutes of fighting, followed by a few minutes of walking..... I am really looking forward to the next film.  In theaters, even.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Whattya want?  Shakespeare?  Judd Apatow is brilliantly funny.  he always has some overly-juvenile parts but who cares?  gotta take some bad to get the great.
B0064ORVCQ|4.0|No one needs my opinion of the movie itself, a worthy continuation of the HP cycle.  The 3D, however, adds little to the film and is at times more disorienting than effective. (Enhanced 3D instead of filmed in 3D?)  The director obviously was not thinking in 3D at the time of filming, so the movie never really takes advantage of the process.  Still, some nice bits but not an effective showcase for the technology.
0880794968|4.0|The deck (78 cards) has good size and nice colors. The cards are a little slippery because they are probably new. The colors seem very good so I think that the &#34;Radiant Raider-Waite Tarot&#34; may be colorful in excess to me.
0896898288|4.0|This book was a gift for an avid quilter who is also into quilt documentation and history.  She has enjoyed it and found it to be very informative.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was so sorry when I finished up the hornets nest book....I just wish there was another one or two or three.  Couldn't put them down.  I somehow felt a connect to her earlier life.  Don't know why.
1603427244|4.0|It is nice to have all of these techniques in one place.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  It will be very useful especially when creating my own patterns.  I think it was a good investment.  I also like the smaller size--it is very portable.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely.  Couldn't put it down.  I am glad there were three of them.  Hope there will be more.  Nina Fontaine
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great app! My daughter and I love it! We have been playing it for the last hr trying to beat my other daughter and my husband!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This gives one a glance into what is like to be poor and sick at the same time.  The more I learn about it, the more I realize American health care is really in a shambles and I think it started with all the fraud allowed with Medicare and Medicaid.  Nina Fontaine
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Well written, as are all of his books. I need to add more words in order for this review to be entered.  Makes me want to ignore future requests for reviews here on Amazon.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Great game.  Good work for brain.  Really works your executive decision making.  Focus and reason are definitely at work.  Recommend for all ages
B0015DWJ8W|4.0|I enjoyed reading his perspectives on long distance running as a runner myself. I feel that I have has many of the same thoughts and conversations with other runners.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Another well-done app that can be played by all ages.  Kids & adults will love chopping the fruit as it gets tossed into the air.  Avoid the bombs and just go nuts with your chopping finger!!  Super cool time waster app-recommend with 5 stars!!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim, the latest film from visionary director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy films, plunges us into a world where giant creatures known as the Kaiju have emerged from a portal beneath the Pacific Ocean we deem \\"The Breach.\\" When jets, tanks and bombs don't do the job, the major nations of the world come together to create the Jaeger Program; giant mechs controlled by two pilots over a neural bridge called The Drift, where two minds come together as one, sharing memories and emotions. The Jaegers seem to get the job done, keeping cities and countries safe, but everything changes when the Kaiju begin to learn our defenses, and the Jaegers begin to fall. Soon, the apocalypse begins, and only a few Jaegers stand against the tide.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is one of the best science fiction films I have ever seen, having the fun, clichéd blockbuster side of Independence Day, and the expert directing, flawless visuals and good acting of a purely well-made film. Is this a Best Picture winning film? No, but by all means, it is an instant SF-Action classic. The battles between Jaegers and the Kaiju always progress, becoming harder and more challenging, the characters do develop, even the minor ones (Hannibal Chou, the pilots of Striker Eureka, and the scientist duo), and the emotion is real. Del Toro proves here that he is capable of turning a mindless blockbuster hit into a work of art. I don't want to spoil much about this movie, but I must say, the Kaiju are some of the most amazing and creative creatures in all of cinema. Del Toro truly put all his heart into the movie, and it showed itself.<br /><br />There is so much to this story that many questions are raised and left unanswered, but most of them can be through sequels. Cancelling the apocalypse is not the end. This movie is not for everyone, being pure science fiction and has loads of action throughout, but it is very well-made, even with the cheesy moments (momentum can be funny, to those who've seen it)<br /><br />5/5 Stars*****
B00B29J0I6|3.0|Cute app-great graphics and design.  The setup is another physics game where you have to get Roby out of the area by using blocks etc. to reach the exit.  Requires lots of thinking outside the box and intelligent strategy instead of brute force.  But-the game gets VERY hard, VERY quickly.  The kids gave up on it because it was just impossible to get past the levels.  Too bad because otherwise it's very well done and Roby is cute as can be!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|My cousin likes this app better than than the other facebook apps I have gotten,but it just isn't for me.It doesn't let you do as much as as if you went on your laptop or somthing,but it is an easy quick way to reach your facebook account! I just suggest that they update the app so we can do a little more on it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Essentially, Downton Abbey is exactly what refined tv should look like-<br />In depth character development, little history tid-bits to keep you interested in seeing how the characters react, and story rich with drama depicting the clash of social classes and interclass struggles.
034580404X|5.0|Loved, Loved, Loved these books. I was scared to order at first because I didn't know what shape the books would be in. Ok so I ordered the books and they turned out great they were brand new still in original box wrapped up. I was so excited. Now came the reading part. The books started off good then it got a little crazy. I thought what am I reading. My sister said keep reading so I did and these are the greatest books ever. The first is very detailed not like I am used to reading but very good then the romance is just excellent. Very addicting I could not and did not want put the books down. I recommend these books to any girl.........well I would suggest at least 20 yrs old and above just because girls have to experience the real life and reading these book they will expect or want more I guess. All I can say is.............. These books are WONDERFUL....... Loved, Loved, Loved them so much. Hated they are over and had to end...... But I guess I can start all over and read them again.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed with \\"The Final Cut\\" when the album was released in 1983. Expectations were high after \\"The Wall\\", which then seemed to be the perfect album, at once progressive and catchy and with an interesting theme.<br /><br />So what was now \\"The Final Cut\\"? There were of course many similarities with \\"The Wall\\" - sound, lyrical themes, the use of sound effects etc. But generally the songwriting seemed less successful; and one thing that annoyed me much was the violent shifts between quiet and noisy passages in the music,<br /><br />As the fan you are, of course, looking of course for positive moments and I remember indeed that \\"Southampton Dock\\" was a favourite, and to some extent \\"Not Now John\\" which has a certain kinship with \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". The album, for me however, quickly slipped into oblivion.<br /><br />Now many years later, I'm surprised at how positive a rehearing of the album falls out. It is actually an album full of great music. High quality workmanship, of course, well played with fine guitar passages by David Gilmour.<br /><br />The numbers are largely linked to the context and only a few are well suited to stand alone - this could, with some justification go for many of Pink Floyd songs. In any case, I think if  you, like myself, originally more or less rejected the album, should try to give it another chance. I believe many will be pleasantly surprised.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The main theme involves the aerial encounter of an American and German pilot during the horrific bombing of German cities during the war.  Beyond the call to duty it reveals the human side of individuals on both sides of the conflict.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of his books and enjoyed them so much.  So sorry to learn of his death.  I always looked forward to his next book.
B003Y5D776|4.0|It works right out of the box. Unfortunately, it seems the very old Sony Condenser Microphone that I plugged into it is noisy. But luckily, there was plenty of gain (level) to add, as it shows up in the (Apple) laptop's Sound Preferences. Very convenient, small and cleverly designed. You can input line or mic level stereo, (there's a slide switch on the unit's curved edge) and it also has stereo out. All on 1/8&#34; jacks. USB powered, from the computer. I like Griffin, always have, and can't complain about this product. Maybe I should complain about that old Sony mic though :\
B006M4F67A|5.0|The art on the tiles is complex enough that you have to pay attention at your matching and there are a huge number of game varieties available.  The sounds are enjoyable, and it is easy to pass some time if you are stuck waiting somewhere.  This has really beautifully designed tiles.  I rarely play any kind of electronic game, but find this one very relaxing and fun to try to beat your own times if I am feeling competitive.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|It would be more fun if I were any good at it. The interface is slick and it's generally fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome you can build anything you want!  And you can go on survival and you have to break a block to get the block.
B00BK3MSME|3.0|Love Madeleine Peyroux, but this album sounds like she's trying to shake off the effects of a heavy narcotic. I don't expect a lot of cheery uptempo vocalizing from this artist, but I'd think twice before listening to this while driving, given its soporific tone. Just before bedtime, though...?
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Moving historical account of world war l.<br />In depth study of the class system and the details of revolution in Europe.<br />Well developed characters. One of Follet 's best.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Watched season one over the span of a few weeks. Five stars but I am not yet sold on it<br />Long term. Will I make it to season 4 and beyond? Hard to say but I like it so far.<br />Hopefully it doesn't get any more gory than this.  Bloody but not on the level of walking dead, true blood, or even a Quentin terintino movie. And the biker chicks are far better looking than real life!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|good app app. game tight as hell but storyline can be longer. it ws to short i beat tha game in like 2/3 days
B002MCYWHG|5.0|I am an avid Amazon shopper, but rarely review my purchases but this product is just so awesome I had to share. I bought this to take my 2 year old grandson riding with me. I have just recently started riding my bike again, so I am by no means a strong, experienced rider.  I was a little worried about having to deal with 30 pounds of excited toddler plus the weight of the carrier, but it really isn't a problem at all....the design of the carrier distributes the load perfectly.  The seat did appear very small, but he fits in it just fine.  Great product!
B002TVQ4HG|2.0|i like scary movies but this was not that scary to me i love liam hemsworth but the girl that the movie really about is so dumb and the friends well ya they kind are to they go sailing but they get on a big boat cause they have to no one on it but them hello don't stay on it or your going to die to late they are dead its not a bad movie to some people but i did not care for it or like it
B008XKSW7M|1.0|It was not funny.  The plot was very boring.  Nothing like what I thought it would be.  Not worth the time invested.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|One of the MANY great John Wayne movies!  Looking forward to viewing some more of these movies on this site.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|This is easily one of the most stunning novels I have ever read.  Absolutely rivetting, beautifully conceived and executed, I think it is spellbinding.  I was initially sceptical as to whether I would like it or not, but my fears were soon dispelled.  The construct of the novel is ingenius and I am still pondering the novel several weeks after finishing it.  Mitchell does a virtuoso job mixing historical eras, genres and characters, I was blown away by how strong and involving his writing was.  I am not even going to attempt to summarise the plot, apart from saying that the protagonist of each segment  in some way impacts on the protagonist in the following segment.  Whilst I have interpreted the novel as being something of a meditation on the possibility of reincarnation, it is also about how an individual's actions can reverberate through time.  The novel is absolutely stunning, I cannot recommend it highly enough.  I look forward to reading more of Mr Mitchell's novels.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I always forget how much I enjoy James Rollins while I am waiting for his new book to come out.  THE EYE OF GOD was wonderful, up to his usual standards.  I finished it in less than a day and was sad to be done with it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like the movie you will love this game.  The minion runs after the bananas and it's similar to temple run
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|But I prefer Downey singly as Iron Man. It all worked if you're into the composite crew of crime fighters.
B00000ITOY|5.0|My 18 month grandson took to this quickly when I gave it to him.  I like it because it helps them with the basics - colors, shapes, numbers, and coordination.  I hope he plays with it for a long time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got hooked from the very first part, and couldn't wait for new additions. You immerse yourself so deeply into the story world that its sad when you run out of things to read. I've seen others try to imitate it but haven't found one that could compete. Great out of the box thinking in plot lines.
B00466HN6S|5.0|This DVD is exceptional. I could not stop smiling throughout the movie. The bunny is super, super funny. I will always smile on Easter when I think about Hop.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great action in the style Stallone has become known for. Action scenes and lot of shooting and blowing things up....Yeah! My husband especially liked it.
B008602KQI|5.0|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home. Cannot get enough of the movie.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|I love all his jazz, and will buy anything he produces.They take me back to better times and remind me of his live concerts I've been to...LOL...except I can replay it over and over rather than go home and just think about what I heard.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home. I absolutely love this movie and watch it every Christmas along with my other DVD's.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Easy to play for all ages. Love the different rooms. Level ups are easy. Just wish it would give you more bonus time. Like every 12 hrs. This Bingo game is my favorite.
B00000F566|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie. I will miss watching Mr. Patrick Swayze on the big screen. This movie brings me back to a wonderful time in my life. It makes me Happy.
B0053O89KG|5.0|If you like the series you will like this.  the DVD is a good quality.  Just need to enjoy the series which we do
B004CURZFC|5.0|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Thank you so much!~Cd came quickly and in great condition! Now I have an updated version. No more cassette. Thanks.
B001F12J0C|5.0|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home. The movies are action packed, thrilling, keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing this!! enjoy it everyday. very addicting.. hard to put down!!<br />don't like how they changed things after the update...disappointed in that<br />but still a very good game to have downloaded
B0072GPQNG|5.0|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home. What a wonderful bond.
B003G94BZC|3.0|This Doctor is like Vanilla ice cream, it's good but it really needs some toppings to make it shine and unfortunately the stories and dialogue is not providing it. It is still an entertaining series but he lacks the power and good scripting of season two and three.
B005LAIISA|5.0|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have followed The Wheel of Time for the last 10 years and had at times given up hope that it would ever be finished, even more so after Robert Jordans death... This book completes the series in a way that is true to the feel of the rest of the books and gives the reader a great final view into the world of The Dragon Reborn. I would recommend this book for all who like intelligent and epic fantasy and have the patience to read all the other books first...
B002APU580|5.0|Fabulous movie ~ wanted a leading man more like Colin Firth in the BBC version, but the actor was good just didn't look like Colin Firth.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I saw the movie in a theater. There were multiple conversations going on and I wanted to be able to rewind and see/hear them again. Great movie.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|My son loves this app.  He has had hours of fun with the voice imitator and getting Ben to make funny noises that he makes first. Only thing i dont like is having to watch videos of other apps to earn test tubes.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I keep getting messages that my version is obsolete, then when I try to install a new one, it says it isn't on my device- which of course it is. Then I try to register, and it doesn't recognize my email- any of 'em or passwords, though I know they are correct. Facebook works fine on my PC and my iPad, but functionality on the Kindle Fire HD is marginal at best.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Straight up rock and roll so don't be expecting the prog you're used to getting from Portnoy. Songs are well-written and each musician is blended nicely in the mix. A must buy!
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Better than the original.....Kenny Wormald & Julianne Hough can dance!  Different enough from original to keep the viewers interest and entertained.
B001CTDH76|5.0|This arrived very fast.  Being able to watch the shows in the right order made a huge difference in understanding several subtle things in the shows that made no sense before.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|An absolutely charming tale with great descriptions of the loyal friends and family disasters. The boy returns as a man, to validate the events that shaped his life. I looked forward to snuggling under the covers and letting the story carry me away.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The discount on this group, made it easy to purchase.  This was packed very securely, so there was no risk of damage.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love it! It's a great case for my kindle I would suggest getting this case. I love Amazon it always has great deals at low prices.
0061801313|5.0|grandaughter is starting this series and so far she is loving them, lets hope the rest of them are as good as these..
B001NHNG64|2.0|Not a bad story if you like the \\"Reacher\\" series but nothing special.<br />Too many plausible alternative actions for Reacher to take that would have worked better.<br />Too little that had to do with his thought process. Nothing that justified Holly's decision to dump him.<br /><br />But more importantly there is a fundamental flaw in this story.<br />Reacher exists throughout the series as a lone hero.  The police, and the FBI do not<br />know anything much about him,  They are often trying to catch him or lock him up and<br />they certainly neither trust, nor like him. He has a few friends but nobody important.<br /><br />Yet in this one book he<br />1) Saves the life and rescues the daughter of the Director of the FBI<br />2) Saves the life and rescues the goddaughter of the President of the US<br />3) Saves the life and rescues the Agent in Charge of the Chicago office of the FBI<br />and all three of these people know he did it.  Gosh, what does a guy have to do to<br />get a little credit?  Even though I like most of the series the above makes a farce out<br />of the \\"Unknown Drifter\\" concept!
0142410705|5.0|the book was for my grandaughter who is reading as many of john greens books as we can find her. she loves them, and how wonderful to have them available for her. thank you amazon, not everyone carries them,
B00785P2QC|3.0|Reminiscent of other Sim games.... fun to play, love that it runs in the background. A few improvements could be made. The game doesn't show the upgrade cost for buildings.... you are just told you don't have enough. Too much pressure to post on FB.... not many other ways to make investment points.
014241493X|5.0|grandaughter likes this author and i like being able to get them to her.thank you amazon for having a wide variety of books at our fingertips, as well as in out budget--
B001Q4Z5Z4|5.0|Jason Statham rocks on in this pic..well done good ending. enough said. ..........................well done well done well done well done
B009R659L8|4.0|Traditional Higgins Clark suspended.<br /> I loved it but the ending was a little rushed and suspense was too short.  Would have liked more ending and less setting up of the story.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|An excellent app for my Galaxy S3 - if you enjoy You Tube I suggest that you give it a try - if it doesn't work for you, uninstall and try another.  Android makes it so simple...
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|I couldn't get the hubby to watch this movie no matter how hard I tried. So alone I sat.<br />I soon realized it would be his loss. It was sweet like sugar and I liked it a lot. It has this bit of intrigue also because of the mystery going on. I liked that it wasn't just a lovey-dovey romance.<br />Being a woman who was once in an abusive relationship, at times the movie took me to places I wasn't sure I wanted to go to, but it didn't kill it for me or make me want to shut it off. On the contrary. I found myself immersed even more.<br />Now, honestly, it wasn't as good as The Notebook, but it was still decent.<br />Bring tissues for the end.... all I am saying on that.
B005R32L66|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said - text, video, easy interface - Skype does it all, updates regularly and doesn't crash.  Thus far, I am very happy with this app.
0425267695|4.0|There's little I can add here to the comments of over 900 people who've enjoyed this book, except my pleasant surprise at finding it. Truthfully, the cover put me off, with some warrior's mailed fist pressed against his mailed torso, not to mention the title of the book, 'blood song'.  I thought it would be a kind of intensely militaristic jingoist war fantasy similar to military sci-fi, that I generally find so tedious.<br /><br />Not at all! Yes, this is focused on the training of a young boy, Vaelin, in an order dedicated to the military arts (a kind of alternate world's Knights Templar), but it's so much more - devious kings manipulating wars, ancient powers from beyond the grave, a missing magical order, religious persecution - a great fantasy romp indeed, and well written to boot.<br /><br />As for claims that this is such an 'original' story, there are few original stories in fantasy, and this isn't one of them. I don't expect to find originality; in any event, some literary analysts claim that there are only seven basic story lines available to any author. I'm looking to discover if the writer, through his craft, can introduce me to his world, and interest me in the characters and concerns of that world. This writer did.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I installed this into my Synology DS713+ and it works great. I have yet to see over 25% RAM usage though so it may have not been needed but was cheap enough. To install it I just took out the bracket screw from underneath the NAS and pushed the bracket away so I could change out the RAM. Lining the bracket back up only took a couple of seconds but there are two holes so make surer you have the right one lined up or the screw will not go back in. I found this method much easier than taking the thing apart like so many others have mentioned.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's a great way to end the series for now, lots of action and a happy ending for the demigods
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love it it's grate for the little girls I watch they love playing it. it keeps them happy in the car. I cant comeplane
0920668372|1.0|I did not receive the book at all. It has been over a month and still no book. Disappointing, very disappointing.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I read the book and then watched the movie.  Lot's of critical pieces were left out to save time but it was still worth it.  Good acting.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I had already purchased tickets to the &#34;History of the Eagles &#34; tour before early ordering and finally receiving the dvd  blue ray package. My only disappointment is defect with the 2nd disc. I had hoped it was a minor problem but the disc will not start to play after  loading onto my DVD player. It is well beyond the 30 day return period, so I am stuck with only 2/3`s of the Showtime program .
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This Angry birds game allows the player to do everything possible with the game as if on any gaming unit. My little guy enjoys this version as much as the Xbox or Nintendo 3DS.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|This is the continuing story of my favorite cat and his owner.  I first met Bob in the book A Streetcat named Bob and was touched how the 2 street souls saved each other.  I couldn't wait for a sequel.  Here it is.<br />The tale this time more of the interaction of Bob and James.  How extraordinary Bob is and how jealous and cruel people still can be even when you are trying your best to be your best.  A good read and I hope again for more on Bob and James.  I am a big fan of Bob!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Graphics are wonderful and the game itself is lots of fun.It does take a while to download but worth it when all is said and done.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I've been looking for a good kakuro game and this is it! Love the graphics too! Simple but charming. Ican't put this game down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoy the game. Can't wait for part 2. It worked my mind. Keep me inform of any add on.
B00D5YNQMW|5.0|I have been waiting for a Aerosmith to release a full-length concert video for quite sometime now. I have been wondering how a band that is known for its live performances could go so long without such a release, but finally it is here and to my surprise it contains mostly their older hard-hitting classics with not a single ballad! If you are a fan of Aerosmith's earlier material this is a must have. Many will complain about the absence of \\"Dream On\\" but for me it is not missed because this is not a set of hits, its much better than that. That said, \\"Back in the Saddle\\" would have fit in this set list quite nicely. Everyone will likely have several songs that they would have liked to see included, but when you consider the fact that one would be hard-pressed to find a bad song on any of Aerosmith's earlier albums, combined with the fact that many of their lesser known classics are included, such as \\"One Way Street,\\" \\"Draw the Line,\\" and \\"Moving Out,\\" you will not be left disappointed when all is said and done. For me, it really stirs up the same sensation that I felt seeing the band play live in the early 80s.<br /><br />I am not sure what some other reviewers are talking about with their complaints about the interviews being mixed in. It is just small sound-bites in between songs, nothing over-the-top, and it all blends quite nicely. Great sound quality and HD video! I couldn't be more pleased! For those looking for a live video of hits and ballads, this is not it, and I could only imagine that will be around the corner, but as an old-time fan of their harder-hitting songs from back in the day, this is everything I could have asked for!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A most addicting and enjoyable game. If you loved the movies, you will love this game! Can't wait for the third movie.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Love John Fogerty, glad he made this album.. Would recommend this . I Bought and extra one for a girlfriend.
B0037EPYLG|5.0|Clapton Clapton I love the music to rate Clapton is something I cant do..he is just above all the rest.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game I can not wait for more levels.  I liked the fact that I did not have to go online to check out game cheats.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This version of Judge Dredd is more faithful to the source material then its' &#34;Dreddful&#34; predecessor. Ultra violent, ultra cool, Dredd keeps his helmet on, Lena Headey as the baddy, and no Rob Schneider anywhere in sight. What's not to love?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got so hooked on this program!  It's a good thing I had all the episodes at my fingertips because I don't think I could have waited for each week to pass for another one to come along.  All I could say was &#34;Oh No!&#34; at the end of the last episode.  Now what will happen?  Great program.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Interesting plot and twists and I liked all of the players in the film. Not one to watch a film many times, I may watch this one again at some later date.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I have really liked this. It is out of the ordinary and has lots of plot twists to keep things interesting.
B000I3R796|4.0|Charlize Theron... for me, she's a pretty good actress nowadays and delivers a good performance in this film.<br /><br />Story line is pure Sci-Fi, without too many leaps of faith.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a while. The opening sentences grab immediately; there is no slow introduction  in which to lose the reader. I laughed a lot (  bus riders near me were obviously curious) and yet it was a profoundly moving and thoughtful journey. I'm now reading Rachel Joyce's 'Perfect'  in which she demonstrates the same depth of perception and understaning of the human soul. I am impressed.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This film has to be a near original story film. I really liked watching this film, with plenty of laughs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|All ages can play. It is fun and enjoyable. I hope you like it as much as me and my friend do.
B004R63MWQ|4.0|I didn't see the original Tron film, released way back when. When I saw this film, I really liked it as the imagery is really well done and the story line is quite good. Afterwards, I watched the original film and thought the original film marginally enjoyable. I like this newer release better.<br /><br />Watch this film in HD, on a large 1080p screen. You'll be amazed. You'll probably like the story too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've been playing this game non-stop and I'm not even a kid! It's really neat you have to take care of it and it may not be a real horse but it's pretty darn close!
B00BEZZBFO|4.0|I bought this fan thinking... Its going to be competing with 2 x 140 top exhaust fans, better to make sure it will run without undue effort/stress to turn the blades when the other exhaust fans are doing their job. Whether or not this fan does what its suppose to do, hard to measure. But I will say that it does exhaust air sufficiently from the case, as expected when the 2 x 140 fans are running.<br /><br />I cannot hear this fan running in the Corsair Obsidian 650 Case. Yeah, there are other fans running in the case (2 x 140 top exhaust, 2 x 120 CPU, and 1 x 200 front ingest) which are probably masking any possible noise from this fans. The overall noise level of the complete system is near inaudible.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? Nothing is perfect and I am not sure &#34;I Love it&#34;. Excellent fans so far, but time will tell as to how they perform over time.<br /><br />Tech Specs:  Asus P9X79 PRO, Intel 3820 CPU, 32 GB Corsair Vengeance RAM, NVidia 650, 3ware 9650SE-4LPML, and Centos 6.4
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game on the kindle. Same one as on my phone. It's fun and addictive. Blah blah blah blah
B001OGWY1W|4.0|What can I say... I liked watching the film. It was fun and not too unrealistic and the story line was well designed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome this game helps me take care of my 5 horses at home and makes it fun
B0014D6PCO|4.0|What can I say... I liked watching the film. It was fun and not too unrealistic and the story line was well designed.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|The book provides an enlightening look inside the author's life. It's an easy read, in a personable style. It does include some useful tips and suggestions for self-enlightenment.
B0030MM68O|4.0|I saw this film before going to AFG, for a contractor OEF effort. And I saw the film again after my return. The heat of being in the desert in the film brought back memories of, oh man, another too hot of a day. And the constant thirst for water. I never sweated so much in my life. Anyway,<br /><br />Interesting film. Somewhat inaccurate, but who cares? Its an interesting story and the film visuals are really good.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|File is so large how could there be no transfer to SD card? I can't even play it. Unreal. This must be corrected.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Enjoyed the film, even though I'm not fond of films with monsters. This film plays out nicely, and isn't too predictable.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I love the Sigma Force Novels, it is fun to follow the characters form book to book.  Sure to read the next adventure.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not much of a Cruise fan, and not much more of Cruise fan after this film, but Cruise did a good job in this film.<br /><br />Interesting story line and the action is a bit predictable and slick, but was easy to enjoy and to watch.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Loved this book ...  it was a fun read and can't wait to read the next book in the series
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Very nice. A nice addition to my granddaughters collection. I would highly recommend it to any Monster High collector. Exactly what I expected.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I saw this series on TV when it first came out in the 2000s.  I had stumbled across Stephen Ambrose's WW2 books when my late husband was in M. D. Anderson Cancer Center hospital in Houston, TX in early 2000.  I had picked up a Reader's Digest Condensed Book from lobby of hotel where I was staying and took it to his room to read something to him each afternoon.  One of Ambrose's books was featured and I began to read it to him as the days went along.  I had never heard of Ambrose until that time and found his works to be so fascinating.  I grew up during WW2 as a child and all that took place in my hometown connected to that event left a deep impression on the me.  My brother in law was in an anti-aircraft unit in Europe and landed on the D-Day beaches about 10 days after June 6, 1944 and later fought in the Battle of the Bulge.<br />I bought this series of DVDs sometime in the mid 2000s to send to a close friend of my late husband.  This friend had served in Europe during WW2 in Army and was of German descent.  He was the consummate historian and after the war was over, took part in the Nuremberg trials.  He could quote verse and chapter of the events of WW2 and I thought this would be a great gift for him.  Sadly he passed away about 7 months after I had sent the series to him and his son gave the original gift of Band of Brother back to me after his father's death.<br />I think Band of Brothers captures WW2 the most accurately of any movie I've ever seen.  Yes, it is brutal in parts but the cohesiveness of those soldiers in Easy Company is inspiring.<br />I do not think again in our lives we will ever see the USA as united as it was during WW2.  People for the most came together and supported the war effort and did their part either with sons and husband in the armed forces or families at home enduring the life style of our country at war.<br />About 3 years ago, my present husband and I were traveling back from NC to our home here in Georgia.  We stopped at the small town of Toccoa, Georgia in the foothills of the North Georgia mountains and visited The Band of Brothers museum that has been established there to honor those men of Easy Company.  It is a small excellent museum manned by volunteers and well worth a visit.  And yes, Mt. Currahee still stands.<br />I have again this week of July 22nd watched my DVDs of Band of Brothers and once more felt inspired and proud of what my country did and accomplished during those very extremely difficult times during World War 2.  I cannot recommend this DVD enough for those who care for their country and have not forgotten the sacrifices made by so many during that dark time in this country's history.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much. Its a cool game that my kids and I can challenge each other on.
B00433SVP6|5.0|This is another great story by Rick Riordan. It’s totally hooked me for the series, cemented me as a fan and definitely further inspired me as a writer.<br /><br />We have some new heroes in Jason, Piper and Leo, along with some old favorites dropping in for the ride. The familiarity on Camp Half Blood eases us into the dawn of a new quest that will span the new series. It’s a clever idea to give us a new hero, Jason, who has no memories of where he is from or what he has done. As the story unfolds, we learn about him at the same time that he learns about himself. Piper and Leo are a couple of teens with troubled pasts, who find themselves thrown together with other wayward teens at Wilderness School. Jason drops in, somehow, and he is mysteriously embedded in their memories, as if he’d been best friends with them for months. And so the tale of this trio starts.<br /><br />Enemies soon surface and in all the mayhem, they are whisked off to a strange, distant place – Camp Half Blood. They learn that they are different from normal teens and that they are in fact, Demigods. It’s certainly a lot for them to take in. So, the storyline develops (I’m not going into detail – I don’t want to spoil anything for those of you who haven’t read the series) and they find themselves embarking on a dangerous quest. They each have different qualities and talents, but there are also hidden secrets. It was interesting to watch the characters develop, and see how they reacted to situations, given their secrets. As friendship and bonds grow stronger throughout the journey, it causes plenty of angst, confusion and personal conflicts with their hidden agendas.<br /><br />If there was anything in the book that troubled me, it was the gang’s uncanny knack of stumbling onto each place that they needed, although they didn’t really know where they were going. But, given that this is fiction, anything is possible, and that’s why I read – to escape reality, and believe in the extraordinary.<br /><br />My bottom line: This is a great start to another series. I’m already engaged with the characters and I’m keen to see what they get up to next. I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure laced with the magic of mythology and modern day settings. Rick Riordan fans won’t be disappointed.<br /><br />Note: I don’t claim to be a pro-reviewer, I am a reader. My reviews are based on my personal thoughts around the story that the book is trying to tell. I try to focus on the story (which is the reason I read) rather than dissect the book and pass comment on typos, writing style or structure.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This thing is great. Sound is excellent and it's so small I sometimes mount it right on the boom! I thought it had failed to record one file but then I found it in a different folder so I don't know how that happened but if you lose a file try looking in all the folders. I use it on dslr shoots and it works great. Records about 13 hours on the card I keep in there, probably a 32GB, I can't remember. I read that the battery dies quickly when using phantom power so I keep a battery in my shotgun mic and turn off the phantom power but I haven't tested it to see whether that's necessary, just going from internet complaints.<br /><br />This thing is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so captivating with new suprises at every floor  although it was fairly hard you simply dont want to resort  to cheats
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|An extraordinary account of a woman's descent into madness - clear intellect and painful honesty are what make this so harrowing. It is written in a very straightforward way and gives a very clear picture of a frightening situation allowing the reader to feel an empathy that would probably not be possible face to face.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|man this game is addicting trust me your going to want to play and play and never stop playing it you hot to play this game just get it and play it then give it rate.
B000007ODL|5.0|JJ Cale will be remembered for a myriad of great records, performed by other artists-Eric Clapton and Lynyrd Skynyrd  amongst others.  In fact, there was not a record collection that didn't include Cale's first two albums, which key songs are represented here.  In fact, this set starts off with Call Me The Breeze, which became one of LS's signature tunes of the early 70's.  The haunting Magnolia is also here, very forlorn in it's original take.  Cajun Moon sneaks around like a Dr. john standard.  There are a few tracks that you may not be familiar with, but that carry that exact same feel like Midnight In Memphis, Sensitive Kind and Devil In Disguise.<br /><br />We've grown up with these songs, so get to know the man who wrote them!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Only the best movie ever, written by the best author ever, Chuck Palahniuk. Truthfully it can't be topped; hands down.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had heard to Tesla (who hasn't) but I didn't know very much about him. I got this for free on the kindle store and it had really great information about his life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is exactly as the title stated. It's so much fun, and you can play with your friends if you want.
034580404X|4.0|I've got to say that I really don't like twilight at all so I didn't know if I would like this or not.  My friends were all reading them so I decided to.  I really did like it a lot.  I don't like that her \\"inner goddess\\" is doing quite so much but the story is pretty interesting.
B00849F82E|5.0|Chesterton presents a wonderful framework of how people look at the world affects their perception of events and even shrinks or expands their perception of reality itself. A difficult yet highly worthwhile read. A master of presenting the paradoxes he discovered and why orthodox Christianity is worthwhile.
0385486804|4.0|This book is about a young man that decided to live off the grid. I found his decision interesting.  The author did a good job researching the story and did a good job of making the reader feel like they were right there with the young man.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book is amazing. It is addicting I could not put the book down. The series is amazing and also addicting.
B008VNI9IS|3.0|The husband and wife team of Fabio Armiliato and Daniela Dessi have made some fine opera recordings, especially a notable La Fanciulla del West DVD from 2005. This Tosca, while having its strengths, chiefly from the two principals, is let down otherwise.<br /><br />Armiliato is an ardent Cavaradossi, in fine voice, cutting a dashing figure. He has charisma, sings with passion and is the chief attraction here. Dessi gives a valiant, ardent effort as Tosca, even giving an encore for \\"vissi d'arte\\" from an adoring Genoa audience, honoring their home-town diva. But there are some problems with her vocal production. She is strained in her upper range, bringing some shrillness and unsteadiness to an otherwise good, but not top-class portrayal. I'll take Gheorghiu here, in either her 2001 film with then-husband Roberta Alagna or the live 2011 Covent Garden performance with Jonas Kaufmann. She is just smoother voiced and more compelling in both her acting and upper range than Dessi, even being the pro that Dessi is. There is some obvious chemistry here with Armiliato, but Dessi, in a cruelly competitive world of Toscas, does not reach the top for my taste. And at 52 years old, she looks a bit old for the youthful Tosca.<br /><br />The Scarpia is well sung by Claudio Sgura, but I find his portrayal rather ham handed - stock gestures from a serial groper. He is too melodramatic, especially in act two, for my taste. And this opera does not need added melodrama. I am spoiled by the subtle yet more insidiously menacing Ruggero Raimondi and Bryn Terfel in the above videos. Even the smaller roles here - Nikolay Bikov's Angelotti and Paolo Maria Orecchia's Sacristan - seem underplayed, not very convincing. The chorus, too, seems to be going through the motions.<br /><br />The opera needed stronger stage guidance. Renzo Giacchieri's direction is just too drab and lifeless. It's as if he had two pros in Dessi and Armiliato and he relied on them to carry the opera. He seems to have had little impact on the others. It's not enough. Things are not helped by the all-too-lethargic, pedantic conducting of Marco Boemi. The pulse does not rise as often as it should. The color and the drama need more life, more spine.<br /><br />The sets, based on the original 1900 efforts of Adolf Hohenstein, have tradition and simplicity in their favor. But to my eyes - possibly spoiled by elaborate productions from Covent Garden and the Metropolitan Opera - act one looks drab and underdone, and the staging throughout doesn't stand out.<br /><br />All told, I'll stick with Gheorghiu.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Going to keep it short and quick.<br /><br />Setup: Easy from my macbook pro.  They thought of everything from what I can see to make the start of this relationship smooth.<br /><br />Graphics: Fantastic, Google Music Poor<br /><br />Streaming: Started out ok, but HD video it struggles. I have a 30mbs internet via my ISP.  Also my routher is a [[ASIN:B005S0BYQ6 Factory Refurbished Cisco Linksys E2500 Advanced Simultaneous Dual-Band Wireless-N Router]].  TV and  Mac are 10ft away from both.  It's not usuable right now.  I will play with my settings to see if that helps but its choking up all streams.<br /><br />Final verdict. It doesn't work well enough for me.  But if theres one thing that Google is, is a team of programmers.  It will get better, for now I'm breaking up and going back to my old GF appletv.
B001KZVQJI|4.0|I liked all the different versions of this movie that they came up with.  The original version they came up with brought back a lot of memories but I think I would have to rate this one as the best of the three.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is very challenging but fun too. Some of the rooms are straightforward and you can figure things out fairly quickly but there are some rooms that are hard. Overall I will keep playing it.
1451638450|5.0|I wondered about this book - I wasn't sure that Ivan would work as the centerpiece of the story, and I had been kind of disappointed with Cryoburn.  But I couldn't pass up a new Vorkosigan novel.  And it worked much better than I expected.<br /><br />Like some of the other late-Vorkosigan novels, this one will work better if you're already familiar with the characters.  The one it recalled for me was Civil Campaign, with its family dynamics and comedic turns.  And seeing Ivan at the center, with Miles as a side character rather than the center of the story, worked out very well, building on all the old familiar lore while adding a new perspective.
B008220BLG|5.0|Pretty good movie. I bought it for a friend as a birthday gift and he loved it. It has zombies and some action, but is mostly a chick flick. The romance between the zombie and the female lead is pretty cute. Not a gory zombie flick at all and appropriate for tweens.
B00A6L78YE|5.0|Love this CD. It reminds me of Beck! Thoughtful and amusing lyrics, with a tad bit of sarcasm included. One of my favorites of 2013.
B002XXNSF6|3.0|This movie was an ok romance. I thought it has been overrated. It may be that the theme has lost it's novelty.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great book, I bought this book because I just started running and wanted to read something about this topic. Wow, this was a great story and reinforced my commitment to run.
B002HML6Y8|4.0|Seems like Hugh Jackman is pure gold to any studio that contracts him lately.  He does an exceptional job playing the part of Van Helsing hunting the dreaded vampires, but with enough comic relief to make the film entertaining.  For you men out there, my husband's thought on the film:  When do we ever get enough of Kate Beckinsale in tight leather outfits!  She is a lovely lady with great acting skills.  She doesn't disappoint in this film either.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My son love Ninjago and he loves this set.  He usually mix pieces with other sets and creates all sort of stuff and really enjoys the process of creating.
