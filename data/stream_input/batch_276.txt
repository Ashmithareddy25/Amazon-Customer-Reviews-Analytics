0064409422|5.0|The kids are amazed when they see the once dead Aslan alive again. The flabbergasted kids ask all kinds of questions and Aslan tells them to be quiet while they plan revenge against the White Witch. In this scene battle plans are made and Peter shows bravery in this fantasy book.<br /> An amazing battle breaks out with the two sides led by Peter and the White Witch. They ferociously fight back to overthrow the White Witch. In this scene where Peter is wounded in battle, and Lucy heals him with one of her gifts from Father Christmas, will Peter survive?<BR> <BR>When they arrive at the White Witch's castle they see stone sculptures and are amazed because they know that they are not sculptures they were people. This shocked even me.<BR>Those are just three of the most exciting parts in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. This is book number two in this nerve-racking series. It was an amazing book that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I want to read all six of the other books in this phenomenal series. I hope that you will take advantage of any opportunity to read this book. I personally enjoyed the action and adventure in this book.
B00005NDER|5.0|Released by Toshiba-EMI (originally by Elektra/Warner Pioneer in Japan).  I had the boring U.S. LP at first, but real fans want imports like these, so I went for it.  The remixes are the same ones as on the U.S. edition on Hollywood Records.

B00006V9A0|3.0|There are two ways to view this greatest hits compilation of one of the most recognized bands in rock history.  One way is an introduction for new fans to Nirvana, the other way is as a quick cash in attempt for Courtney Love so she can keep living off her dead husband's work.  Nevertheless, this compilation, simply titled &quot;Nirvana&quot;, is really a mix of both.  The opening unreleased track &quot;You Know Your Right&quot; was recorded months before Kurt Cobain's suicide, and it is definitely eerie hearing Kurt's voice on a never before heard song.  The song itself is pretty good and would have been a big hit for Nirvana years ago, but the chorus can get a little repetitive and you'll be wishing the song was longer.  We also get a remix of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, and Nirvana staples &quot;In Bloom&quot;, &quot;About A Girl&quot;, &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, and naturally &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.  Those new to the band may find this as an excellent doorway to Nirvana, but older hardcore fans are much better off with Nirvana's albums and are better suited to wait for the upcoming box set.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'll be honest.  I used to hate Christina Aguilera for the simple fact that she was wasting her so obvious talent on the teeny-bopper ...that she was singing before.  This album is a BIG difference.  Although the first single, Dirrty, would lead you to believe otherwise, this album is completely different than any other pop album on the market right now.  Dirrty is probably the worst (and trashiest) track on the album, but all the other tracks are nothing short of brilliant.  Christina sings every song with such passion, and the fact that she helped write and produce the album is a big plus in my book.  Props to Christina on this effort.
B000002IZ4|5.0|STP's debut &quot;Core&quot; may have been a smash hit, but was unjustly bashed by critics who called STP nothing more than a band riding the grunge wave.  So in 1994, a year which would see releases that would be hailed as classics later on from Pantera, Soundgarden, Corrosion of Conformity, Nine Inch Nails, and Marilyn Manson; all would be overshadowed by the suicide of Kurt Cobain, STP released &quot;Purple&quot;, the album that would define the band as a whole and leave &quot;Core&quot; in the dirt.  Opening track &quot;Meatplow&quot;, along with &quot;Lounge Fly&quot;, &quot;Unglued&quot;, &quot;Vasoline&quot;, and the Zeppelin-esque &quot;Pretty Penny&quot; are among the band's finest works, and even the big hit singles &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; and &quot;Big Empty&quot; are impossible not to love.  All in all, &quot;Purple&quot; would be STP at their apex, and they have not been able to top themselves since.
0385486804|5.0|I'm afraid to sound overly enthusiastic about this book for fear that those so \\"annoyed\\" by it will take their anger in spending [money] on Jon Krakauer. Krakauer is a great journalistic writer and his work and research far exceeds any ficticious adventure flick.<br />I can understand how one can get confused with the shifts in location and time during McCandless's two year journey, but retracing the man's steps should not be the focus. Krakauer enlightens the reader and unfolds the mystery of McCandless's death as interviews, childhood experiences and stories of similar adventurers give greater insight to the man's psyche. I was continuously facinated as I read highlighted passages from McCandless's books, grafitto, et al which Krakauer includes at the beginning of each chapter. All the research he has done is not just laid out flat, but revealed in a dialogue between him and the reader.<br />Others I've read remark McCandless as stupid, selfish, uninteresting, and a waste of a human life, suggesting stories by Jack London as a superior examination of human condition. <br />\\"McCandless [and other readers obviously] conveniently overlooked the fact that London himself had spent just a single winter in the North and that he'd died by his own hand on his California estate at the age of forty, a fatuous drunk, obese and pathetic, maintaining a sedentary existence that bore scant resemblance to the ideals he espoused in print\\" (44). <br />It is sad to know that such a life holds more respect than one man's passion to actually live out his beliefs as did McCandless. <br />As far as calling this man stupid and selfish, some readers happen to skim over the parts about his college education and donating [money] to OXFAM America, a charity dedicated to fighting hunger. I don't know where you live, but how many teenagers do you know who read War and Peace and spend the last of their money to buy hamburgers to give to the homeless while their peers are out partying?<br />McCandless may have been overly confident and stubborn to make his way on his own, but weren't his ideals real? Those who knew him speak of his true love of nature and high spirits. How anyone can claim he was wasting his life instead of living for the gain of material possesions is beyond me. McCandless reached his dream of living off the land and he did it for over 100 days, while others work their whole lives and feel empty, never knowing the real beauty of the world.<br />Krakauer tells of experiences with Alaskan hunters who claim that McCandless was wrong in thinking the animal he killed was a moose after examining the bones. \\"It was definitely a caribou...you'd have to be pretty stupid not to tell them apart\\" (177). Krakauer later found out that the animal was in fact a moose. Seems as though the natives are overly confident of themselves as well.<br />And had it not been for a bit of information left out in a refernce book of edible plants, McCandless may have survived.<br />The main thing that saddens me when I read reviews with low ratings is the hypocritical way the reader will toss off a man's life as not worth the pages in this book while complaining about McCandless wasting his own life. No one is trying to make this man out as a saint and judging his actions on your own ideas of success does not give your life more reason.<br />I'll end with a few quotes of the book that some may need to read over:<br />\\"McCandless wasn't some reckless slacker, adrift and confused, racked by existential despair. To the contrary: His life hummed with meaning and purpose. But the meaning he wrested from existence lay beyond the comfortable path: McCandless distrusted the value of things that came easily. He demanded much of himself-more, in the end, than he could deliver\\" (184).<br />\\"'Sure he screwed up' Roman answers, `but I admire what he was trying to do. Living completely off the land like that, month after month, is incredibly difficult. I've never done it. And I'd betyou that very few, if any, of the people who call McCandless incompetent have ever done it either, not for more than a week or two. Living in the interior bush for an extended period, subsisting on nothing but what you hunt and gather-most people have no idea how hard that actually is. And McCandless almost pulled it off'\\" (185).
B00005JKED|4.0|What may seem on paper as a run of the mill, crooked cop drama is brought to the screen almost brilliantly thanks to the unbelievably superb performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.  Hawke plays idealistic rookie cop Jake Hoyt, assigned to partner with veteran NARC Alonzo Harris (Washington) for his first training day in Los Angeles.  As the day goes on, Hoyt watches in awe and horror as he learns an ultimate lesson he'll never forget: sometimes the best cops can go very, very bad.  Washington is sincerely frightening in his role as the crooked cop Harris who believes he must do whatever he can to survive.  Hawke is nearly as great in his role as well, but while the film does start out as a great character study, it has a more than predictable climax and ending that doesn't suit the rest of the film well.  Director Antoine Fuqua, who helmed The Replacement Killers, seems to be finding his directorial niche and moves the film at a nice pace.  Washington would receive his first (and more than overdue) Best Actor Academy Award while Hawke received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yullin, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray, and Peter Greene also have major and supporting roles in the film.  All in all, Training Day is a hard hitting, gritty crime drama with superb performances that elevate it above many films of the same genre.
B00007E8V4|5.0|first off, to nikki who posted a review a few days ago, it'd be kinda hard to see how their music is evolving from this album considering almost every single one of these songs were created before any of the songs on toxicity.  anyway, system shows again why they are probably the most original hard band out there.  its a nice break from the same repetitive generic junk you constantly hear on the radio.
B000021XS0|5.0|To start off, i think this is the best cd i have ever heard. I've only been a dream theater fan for about two months. My friend told me about them, telling me that they were the best band, with amazing solos, etc. He let me listen to &quot;Blind Faith&quot; from SDOIT, and i was blown away. From that day, i was hooked. I have every album except awake and falling into infinity now, and i am a huge fan. <br />This album is the best one.. although it doesn't contain all my favorite songs, it just doesn't let up. The plot is so intriguing throughout the whole album.<br />Overture 1928 is an incredible instrumental song that sets the mood for the album. Fatal Tragedy is a great song with an insane guitar solo. I listen to the cd and wait for it to disappoint me, because i thought all albums do, but this one doesn't. If you like DT and don't have it yet, you should already be driving to your local music store. <br />Amazing CD.
0060935464|5.0|Harper Lee truly enthralls the mind of his reader in To Kill A Mockingbird by examining emotions, experiences, and the ignorance of people living in a small town called Maycomb.  One could say that Maycomb was a town comprised of thickheaded individuals that were very closed minded and set in their ways.  Also, in this era whites were dominant to blacks, and segregation was the law that by which all blacks had to abide.<br />Atticus Finch was a lawyer, and also a single father of two children growing up in the town of Maycomb.  His son Jeremy (Jem) and his daughter, the narrator Jean-Louis (Scout), were at the age of questioning everything, and also at the age where certain experiences would etch and mold the way both would think, feel, act, and behave in the future.  Atticus being a wise, humble, caring man knew this so he did his best to not shelter but to welcome questions and concerns that each of his children may have.<br />Scout tells her experiences with Atticus, Jem, their friend Dill, her talks with Miss Maudie, altercations with Mrs. Dubose and her Aunt Alexandra, her views on school, and her childhood obsession with Boo Radley.  Everything seems to be well for the Finches, until Atticus agrees to defend a black man by the name of Tom Robinson that is accused of raping a white man's daughter.  The story erupts with emotion, drama, and at this point is virtually impossible to put down.<br />This book is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.

B00007E8O5|5.0|Sure, Alice In Chains was a marvelous group, perfectly positioned in the zeitgeist of the early 90's.  But this is Jerry Cantrell's best and most consistently satisfying work.  The full edition of \\"Degradation Trip\\" is more diverse musically and takes on a darkness even more intense than on the one-CD version.  It's full of powerful playing, clever songwriting, and some of Jerry's best lyrics - an area of his work where he is still developing.  Cantrell's voice is outstanding here, which addresses one of the few weaknesses from \\"Boggy Depot.\\"  And with more sinister vocal harmonies, one will easily recall the glory of \\"Dirt.\\"  \\"31/32\\" is perhaps the most affecting of the new songs, but frankly, this album works extremely well as a cohesive whole.  Now for the next trick:  can Jerry leave behind the utter despair inherent in these lyrics and write new songs reflecting a fuller range of life's emotions?
0345448898|3.0|Pullman's thesis, that bad things are done in the name of religion, is harmless enough, but as Jewish person I can't help but feel completely annoyed that apparently some kind of High Anglican/Catholic theology is the only religion that exists for P.  Sophomoric logic and an oversimplified approach-- yes the book asks difficult questions, but so does Ayn rand.  If you like propaganda disguised as fiction, you'll love these.<br />That said, books 1 & 2 are very exciting stories, with some wonderful characters in them.  It's only in Book 3 that the preachiness becomes heavy-handed, boring, and near-sighted.  For some of us, the pros/cons of historical Christianity are, believe it or not, irrelevant.
B00006M183|5.0|I have read several reviews and a majority of these pieces compare this excellent album with Pearl Jam's earlier works. Many of these reviews complain that Pearl Jam doesn't sound the same as on earlier albums. Yet these same reviewers would be complaining that Pearl Jam has shown no growth as a band if this album was to sound the same. It's unfortunate that some publications'reviews (Rolling Stone, etc.) have deteriorated to the point that artists that will sell more copies of a magazine get great reviews for absolutely awful records (Justin Timbelake - 4 stars??).<br />Instead of comparing this album to earlier Pearl Jam, I think it is more relevant to compare it to the music that is &quot;in&quot; now. I can't help but think that if Pearl Jam wasn't an already established band, but rather an up and coming one, critics would hail this album as one of the year's finest. <br />Riot Act has a similarity to the White Stripes, The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, etc, because this album is rooted in the modern classics. One song can be Dylan, the next can be Stevie Ray Vaughan, another Led Zeppelin. This diverseness is what makes this album worth listening. There aren't 15 identical songs with different titles. <br />For football fans, I like to think of this album as the 2001 New England Patriots - no superstars, just a collection of really solid parts put together to form a terrific winner.<br />I'm not sure if I really actually reviewed anything here, or if this will help in any way, but those were my rambling thoughts. <br />For Pearl Jam fans, I'll leave with this: Am I crazy, or do &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; and &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; sound extremely similar to The Hives and The Vines?
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia will do no harm to the reputations of the people involved in its making. Chris Nolan continues to perfect his skills as a filmaker, Al Pacino gives us another great performance, Robin Williams manages the near super-human task of suppressing his Robin Williamsness (i.e. manic comic genius),and gives a thoughtful and spot-on character performance, and Hillary Swank does nicely in a supporting role. The thriller is taut and complex and takes place in a new and interesting setting.<br />Too bad there was an original movie of Insomnia, that takes place in Norway, that has much of the same elements but also some great differences. If one has seen both, the comparisons & contrasts are impossible to avoid. Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the bleary-eyed sleepless detective, but Stellan Skarsgard in the Norwegian version is no slouch at acting either.<br />I won't go into detail on the changes and diversions in both films. I recommend that movie buffs see both, as they are different films, despite sharing relatively the same story. <br />I find the European version is more enigmatic, not drawn in bold black and whites, and with a feeling of life's quixotic accidents. The central crime/cover-up by the detective is motiveless in the Norwegian version, in the American film there is an added subtext that either deepens or makes simpler the detective's actions, depending upon your point of view. The byplay between the murderer and the detective is more complex in the American, and more subtle and less defined in the European. Pacino is a man with troubles, Skarsgard is a troubled man. <br />But finally, the big difference is in the ending. I was disappointed that the American version opted to end everything in a typically American fashion, with a bullet, and all strands wrapped up in a bow. The American film is inexorable and predestined, the Norwegian film more open to happenstance and accident. The European version leaves the end enigmatically unresolved. Iwon't say which is best. That, each viewer will have to decide for themselves.<br />Both versions are well worth your interest.

I went out and bought another copy to keep for myself and to read again.<BR>Buy this book and enjoy it.  It will be one of the best reading experiences you have enjoyed.  Plot twists, suspense, an unexpected ending. Read this book on the weekend.  You won't want to put it down.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think were seeing the spawn of a star. She knows how to reach my heart. I think she's a very good surprise. People like Lavigne needs to show up more, have more chances to show its work.<BR>The band is great, great guitars, great lyrics and she's so young. Hopefully she'll learn to preserve her musicality in this bu$ine$ world.<BR>\\"Things I'll never say\\" is just the perfect soundtrack when I'm driving my car and trying to have a good time.<BR>\\"I'm with you\\" is very dense and deep, you better not to be alone when you hear it.<BR>\\"Unwanted\\" is tottaly kick-butt-over-drive-guitar.

B00005RFAI|1.0|Pink is another pop artist whose music and image I loathe (alongside Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton). There is nothing tough or \\"punk\\" about this twit. Her hair color is about original as Avril Lavigne's attitude. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is just about the stupidest song title that any artist come up with (except for Aaron Carter's \\"The Clapping Song\\"). I swear if I hear \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", \\"Just Like a Pill\\", and \\"Get This Party Started\\" one more time, I am going to use my stereo as the sacrificial lamb for a voodoo ritual to try to make my local radio stations stop playing her godawful music incessantly. I can't stand her new song \\"Family Portrait\\". Any wonders why I can't stand listening to artists [whine]and moan about their personal life without any form of redemption or hope. \\"Missundaztood\\" is just a vile piece of work that should only be used as a coaster or as a frisbee.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Retreating a bit from the country-tinged focus of his previous work, this cd is straighter-ahead, guitar-driven, balls-to-the-wall (whatever that means) rock and roll music. And some powerhouse ballads(not to be confused with 'power' ballads known to glom up FM radio). With whip-smart, say-just-enough lyrics. Although he doesn't have a great voice, he's got the right one. The crystalline production is come by rightly by Ethan Johns, the talented son of Glyn Johns, engineer/producer of, among others, The Rolling Stones whose work this CD much resembles. Adams' versality and prolificacy are frightening (as is the thought of ever using the word 'prolificacy' again). There are so many good songs here that they spill over onto a second CD. We are more than a bit reluctant to say that 'we have seen the future' of rock and roll, but we may have just met the new Boss.

1400031354|5.0|In the 2nd novel of his series on Precious Ramotswe, the only lady detective in Botswana, Alexander McCall Smith continues to turn the detective genre inside out with some of the best writing you'll see in any genre.  Precious is African, female, of &quot;traditional build,&quot; open-hearted, optimistic, and wise, in opposition to the classic hard-boiled cynical American wiseguy.<br />&quot;Tears of the Giraffe&quot; develops the metaphor of a detective as a kind of mother who, by observing the people around her carefully, is at the same time taking care of them. The maternal theme is explicit in this story: the primary mystery involves an American mother looking for a long-lost son.  At the same time Precious must cope with the sudden adoption of two winsome orphans by her fiancee, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.  Watching out for people, watching out for Africa itself, is a way of respecting it.<br />The style of the book mirrors Precious herself: simple, too-the-point, a fine sense of humor, and very observant.  There are some really eloquent even lyrical passages as Precious drives across her belowed Botswana. <br />I again caution that readers with a taste for complex who-dun-it thickly plotted detective novels will find this VERY different.  And if you are new to the Ramotswe series, start with the first book (The Number One Ladies' Detective Agency), which will give you important details of Precious' and Matekoni's history.<br />But please read it eventually - you will find no better-written book this year.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is definately one of the best Cd's of 2002.  Parachutes was an amazing release from this band, but Rush of Blood to the Head is even MORE amazing.  Every song demonstrates the talent of the band and their progression.  This album is more upbeat and a little harder overall(as hard as coldplay can get).  If you loved YELLOW, then you'll love this album.  &quot;In my Place&quot; is a highlight but every single song is as good as it.  It's not one of those albums you only like the song that got air play.  Buy it .  you'll love it! If you listen before you buy, make sure you listen to the end of the album as well...it's just as great!
B0000060NF|5.0|And what I mean by \\"soul\\" is pouring everything from within you into your art...even your tortured psyche. Marvin did this and more on this album that signified his official break from cookie-cutter music and into producing music that means more. From his bout with drug addiction, to his frustration with \\"the system\\" for keeping inner-city folks down, to his plea to save humanity and the environment, to his unashamed profession of his love of God, has anyone now or since kept it real more than he did? I doubt it. These songs came out in 1970 when hippies were still screaming \\"sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll\\", and popular R&B music was little more than modern doo-wop. But Marvin (and Stevie Wonder) tackled what nobody--especially white America--cared to hear: that black folks are struggling, the corporate/industrial complex is ruining the earth, and we need a Higher Power to make sense of it all.<br />Come to think of it, aren't these the same issues we are faced with today?<br />Rest in peace to Marvin Gaye and his music...it will live with me forever.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|i didn't like what the editor's review had to say about t.a.t.u's cd! i love t.a.t.u and they sing great! i love their music(not only their act). and i have a great feeling they're going to invade the u.s. by storm and bring household pop to a new meaning and perspective! they will reinvent pop and will be very big, i feel this to be true. i want to say, i bought their english cd, and have bought their russian cd as well. they rock!!! beautiful music, great voices, and wonderful lyrics! there couldn't have been a better band out there than t.a.t.u!!!
B0000060NA|5.0|At the time, Stevie had not undertaken such a monumental task of a double album. But he was already respected enough that the public gave him a chance.<br />Let's forget--although it's hard to--all the songs that were smash hits. Let's analyze the lesser-known songs. Village Ghetto Land surprisingly got a little radio play back in the day although it was not your typical song. Summer Soft simply reminds me of those pre-teen days when I wore the grooves out of this album. Ordinary Pain is classic Stevie that would have fit on his previous albums. Another Star is my favorite song on the album; it's combines everything Stevie knows about composition and arrangement. And let's not forget I Am Singing, which includes the only Swahili language verses in an American composition. All these songs, plus the hits, culminate into a genius that we knew was there. But we didn't know he could do it LIKE THAT!<br />This album presents the argument of Stevie being included in the realm of the greatest American composers of all-time. His later works virtually proves it. Move over, Duke and Gershwin...you've got company!
B000002H6C|4.0|This album is without question the most complex and intricately arranged work the band has done or ever will do.  My problem with it is not one of those guys played a take the whole way through without a mistake.  They all recorded their parts dozens and dozens of times and simply cut and pasted the best takes measure by measure.  If you have any recording experience, you should be able to hear the edits.  For example, listen to the double bass on &quot;Dyer's Eve&quot;.  Lars would never be able to pull that off live, which is why it has never been heard in concert, along with several songs on this album(&quot;Shortest Straw&quot; being another example).  Of the songs from AJFO they have played live,<BR>&quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; is the only one they dont take shortcuts on.  But, don't get me wrong.  I would rather hear this album than The Black Album or Load.  This album for me is second only to Master of Puppets. If the production values were better(more bass, thicker guitars) if would probably be a tie.  If you are a fan of heavy music and have never heard this whole album I highly recommend it.  Just don't expect to hear any song from this album except &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Harvester&quot; if you go to a Metallica show.

B00006M183|1.0|I've been there from the beginning.  I've watched Pearl Jam play way back in the early days.  I was in Bremerton.  I've seen them at the Showbox under the mysterious name \\"Pissbottle Men.\\"  And now it's come to this.  The death toll of this band has sounded.  They are no longer interested in innovative, cutting edge riffs.  The songs are drab, hurtful and painfully awful.  Gone are the days of internal fire.  PJ seems as though they're striving to become an amalgamation of Phish and The Greatful Dead.  If this interests you, buy the CD and then buy yourself a coffin.
B00005QHSN|4.0|In today's plastic pop world, it's nice to hear music that is original, yet draws on many different influences. TTD is such an artist and unfortunately thanks to his uncategorizable sound, his music goes unnoticed.  The public doesn't like being challenged or having to take the time to actually HEAR music. They are used to being visually assulted with artists who look great, but whose music is basically simple and substance-free.  Terence is all about music. He isn't a commercial artist, but is honest, soulful and has a hell of a voice. He is kind of cross between Prince, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. Being a huge fan of all those three, I can't help but love TTD as I have since he first came into our public concience in 1987.<br />His latest album is a cross genre disc with many great songs. Best tracks: O Divina, My Dark Places, Shalom, Sweetness, and Testify. If you enjoy real music and like albums that are real ALBUMS and not just collections of same sounding songs, check this one out.  Also, check out three of the best albums I've ever heard:<br />Introducing the Hardline...<BR>Symphony of Damn<BR>Vibrator<br />All by TTD, of course
B000068OSK|1.0|TWS serve up rehashed basic chords and basic, boring grade-school drumming that are supposed to somehow make them seem original, hip, and supposedly forging a 'new direction'.  All this CD offers is a third-rate mishmash of directionless, already done a million times garage band talentless noise by a duo of dorky mediocre musicians with bad fashion sense, who insist on dressing in candy cane colors as part of their schtick.  Maybe if they entered the music scene in the late 70's/early 80's 'post punk' era, they would have been appreciated more.  Bottom line... life is short... don't waste your time!

0553260111|5.0|How would you like to wake up one day, in Europe, to find out you do not know who you are or where you are from, but still retained physical, emotional and mental instincts that you had when you did know who you were?  I recently re-read this book, having a vague recollection of reading it way back it the early '80s, to refresh my memory on it before going to see the movie of the same title that was released this past summer (I enjoyed the movie immensely by the way).  It's a fun and exciting read, given all of the action, chases, violence, etc.  But fundamentally it deals with someone trying to find out who he really is as defined by his past.  And as the story unfolds and wraps up it seems to figuratively place a question mark on this approach - are you who you are because of what you have done in the past, or what you are doing in the present? Not to get too cerebral, because the book is basically entertaining and not &quot;deep&quot;, but that is what it left me thinking about.
B000006TRV|5.0|After Pink Floyd lost its lead singer, Syd Barrett, the band was unsure how to proceed. Barrett had been the heart of the band, writing most of the songs and serving as lead guitarist. But after much abuse of mind-altering drugs, Barrett became insane and was forced to leave the band. Floyd began to write experimental music, some of which consisted of random drumbeats and discordant melodies. Their next two albums were reviewed by critics very negatively. Although revolutionary in its irregular style, all but the greatest fans viewed the music as complete trash. The band's popularity plummeted, and it appeared that they would soon break apart.<br /> Then the band acquired a new member, David Gilmour. Gilmour was an aspiring guitarist who had attended high school with Barrett and Roger Waters, the new lead member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour and Waters quickly salvaged the band. In March 1973, they released Dark Side of the Moon, their most popular album and arguably the greatest album of all time. They soon followed with Wish You Were Here (1975) and Animals (1977), both of which were overwhelmingly popular.<br /> In 1979, they released what was perhaps Floyd's most cryptic album, The Wall. Written by Waters and Gilmour, The Wall was written to tell the story of Barrett's life from birth to lunacy, and to search for a reason behind his madness. Floyd brilliantly synthesizes the lyrics with the music to captivate the listener and make him feel as though he is experiencing Pink's struggle with reality.<br /> The album reflects upon the life of a rock star named Pink Floyd (Syd Barrett). Pink is raised by his overprotective mother; his father was killed in World War II when Pink was an infant. He grows up relying heavily on his mother and society, both of which are terribly misguiding him. This is illustrated in the song Mother when Pink's mother responds to his plea for advice by saying \\"Momma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true. Momma's gonna put all of her fears into you.\\"-- Her over-protectiveness is simply a means by which to insure that her worries and insecurities are shared by someone close to her. Additionally, in The Happiest Days of our Lives, the schoolteachers take every opportunity to expose \\"every weakness however carefully hidden by the kid\\". The song then shows the irony of this as when the teachers go home, their \\"fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives\\". The teachers, like the mother, are imposing their own troubles upon the students.<br /> As Pink grows older, these fears become a part of him. He begins to build a \\"wall\\", a psychological barrier between him and the outside world. Every bad memory and experience forms another brick in Pink's wall, until Pink, in a dramatic climax, goes completely crazy and destroys his apartment, nearly killing a \\"groupie\\".<br /> From this point on, Pink acts in a different manner. His \\"wall\\" has taken him over. At a concert, he orders the arrest of \\"queers, Jews, and coons\\". His fans have turned from regular people into a cult reminiscent of the Nazis.<br /> Pink continues in his new \\"fascist\\" manner, holding hate marches and terrorizing his victims. But soon he realizes that he has been living in complete falsehood. In Stop, Pink pleads with his conscience to take him \\"home\\". He ends the song with \\"Have I been guilty all this time?\\" The next song takes place in Pink's mind. Pink puts himself on Trial. His mother, teacher, and wife testify against him, accusing him of estranging himself from them and blaming him for building the wall. The same people who lead him astray are the ones who then testify against him. At the end of the song the judge gives the verdict. Pink must \\"tear down the wall\\". He finally overcomes his fears and a huge rumbling signifies that he has made a transition back to his normal self.<br /> The album ends with a short, but essential song, Outside the Wall. Pink attempts to reunite with those who loved him, but as hard as he tries, \\"Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall\\". Pink is trying to rebuild his life, but his illness has left permanent scars.<br /> Musically, the album is amazing. Every one of its 26 songs is well written, and many feature memorable solos. The music is also eclectic; it ranges from the sardonic ballad Mother to the popular Another Brick in the Wall (part II).  No two songs are alike, and many, like The Trial, use original synthesizer effects that create surreal effects and complement the lyrics.<br />  The Wall is one of the most unique albums of all time. Besides reflecting upon the life of Syd Barrett, it explores human psychology in a manner to which all can relate. Everyone has experienced influences, which ultimately prove detrimental-The Wall shows how harmful these influences may be, and how they can come from even the most close and trusted people. But it also sends a more general message. Society is too often repressing its youth in attempt to mold them into what it wants. This repression, referred to by Pink as \\"thought control\\" is the root of corruption. Even people such as myself, who disagree with the notion of blaming society for an individual's faults, will be able to find meaning in the stirring lyrics and emotional melodies of The Wall.ies, \\"Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall\\".

B00004YZFR|5.0|Gimme Shelter is rock's equivalent to a horror film. This movie's a horrifying look at Altamont, the infamous 1969 free concert in San Fransisco held by The Rolling Stones. And Gimme Shelter was the film that captured it all.<br />The film features concert footage from both Madison Square Garden and Altamont, as well as backstage footage and early recordings of Sticky Fingers, including alternate takes of Wild Horses and Brown Sugar. Songs such as Street Fighting Man and Love In Vain become omens of the terror at Altamont. The real tension begins near the end while the band does a ripping performance of Under My Thumb. You can see the tension that's building up in the crowd. The live performance of Gimme Shelter features chilling images from Altamont ending with a the fatal frozen shot of the knife that killed Meredith Hunter. Gimme Shelter is a chilling portrait of one of the most tragic moments in rock history.
B00006F7S4|5.0|It's difficult to describe the amount of talent Beck owns and displays on all of his albums; however, this by far is his most impressive.  It's amazing what a hard time in one's life can produce.  Although his previous albums were incredible, I feel Beck finally had something he absolutely needed to write and express himself about (maybe something he hasn't had in awhile?).  The Nick Drake comparison is quite evident, to myself, throughout this album and Beck's voice sounds greater than ever!  I would have to rank this album as one of, if not the, greatest album ever in my personal opinion.  I know, to many, that may sound crazy with all the great albums out there - but please buy it and truly listen to the words and music and hard to disagree!
0385501560|4.0|I was recently introduced to Chuck Palahniuk's work by a friend and I must say.....I have a very good friend now. This book was great! The book did have a slow introduction to the characters but Chuck thew in just the right amount of laugh out loud humor to keep you pressing on. Before you get half way through the book you feel like you personally know these characters in the book. (I swear to god Denny's character was based on an old buddy of mine!) Although the twist at the end wasn't a FIGHT CLUB twist, it was still good. If your into crazy, demented characters with a story line that only gets better by the page, I would suggest this book. As for me, I'm moving onto another Palahniuk book.
B000002672|4.0|I have read a lot of mixed reviews of this album, people either love it or hate it.  Well the same goes for most of the Accept catalogue, due to the singing style of Udo Dirkschneider who sings like no other. You either love his voice or hate it.<br />I love it.  He has the wildest, wickedest screaming vocal style you will ever hear, that just blows you away.<br />I must disagree with several other reviewers who claim his voice does not match the musical style of the band, because I think it matches perfectly.  Accept have never been a commercial metal band, they tried that once with a different singer and it failed.  Accept, like Udo's voice is hard, powerful and aggressive, and &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; is no commercial metal album.  It rips into top gear right from the opening track &quot;T.V. War&quot;, and keeps the throttle open through &quot;Monsterman&quot;.  The following title track is one of my all time Accept favourites, with Udo mixing subtle vocals with his familiar banshee screaming, gang vocals, and killer guitar riffs.  As another reviewer said - this album is worth getting for this song alone, but there's more...<br />&quot;It's Hard To Find A way&quot; is Udo sounding softer and is the mellowest track on the album, with a similar sound to &quot;Winter Dreams&quot; from their &quot;Balls To The Wall&quot; album.<br />&quot;Aiming High&quot; is another great Accept rocker, and the following track &quot;Heaven Is Hell&quot; is a classic.  It is the longest track on the album and I love it; again the subtlety and the screaming, the gang vocals - it's great.  Gang vocals again feature on &quot;Walking In The Shadow&quot;, Udo screams as well as ever on &quot;Another Second To Be&quot; and &quot;Man Enough To Cry&quot;, and &quot;Stand Tight&quot; is a great album closer sounding somewhat anthemic.<br />I think this album has been underrated over the years and definitely rates up there with their best work.<br />It is a classic 80's metal album, and unfortunately although there were some bright sparks to come in the 90's, Accept never again released an album with the consistent quality of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;.ately although there were some bright sparks to come in the 90's, Accept never again released an album with the consistent quality of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;.
0066214122|3.0|Oh boy! You can imagine my excitement when I finally purchased a copy of &quot;Prey&quot; -- the book that the local chapter of Hopeful Homosexuals of Guatemala has titled &quot;...a true coming out of the closet novel for both the protagonist and the villain.&quot;<br />The daisy chain formed by Cross, Cooper, and Samson is top-notch, and the fur really flew when Patterson decided to throw in a few mice into the mix. WOW!<br />But despite all this excitement, something was missing...something that I'm sure all readers of &quot;Four Blind Mice&quot; was left asking: did each mouse know that there were three others, and hence he was not special? Maybe this question is best left unanswered, but I for one would've given it the fifth star if Patterson tied this knot.
0393316041|5.0|Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman: the Adventures of a Curious Character provides insight into some of the thinking processes of a great man. The book is organized as a series of generally short chapters that each serve to illustrate elements of Feynman's personality and thinking style through different stories and experiences.  He downplays the details of physics and math where he made serious contributions that resulted in a Nobel Prize and comes across as a thinking everyman (albeit a true polymath) who applied his organized thinking to every situation. He nearly always questioned that status quo and could learn something about topics ranging from hard science to human behavior.<br />Some of the chapters in Surely You're Joking made me laugh out loud. Others were interesting, how to pick locks for example, still others were unexpected and a little racy, how he enjoyed nightlife and music, and the story of his first wife could even be described as romantic.<br />I recommend this book as great reading, particularly for high school and college students, because it is interesting enough to hold one's attention, it gives a biography of a great thinker, and suggests that there are legitimate perspectives for looking at the world beyond those demonstrated in the popular press and media.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is certainly the best sequel soundtrack I've ever heard.  There are no annoying tracks on it, which is in and of itself an accomplishment.  <br />I like all of the tracks, but of particular note are, Foundations of Stone, Evenstar, The White Rider, The Leavetaking, Helm's Deep, Forth Earlingas, and Samwise the Brave.  <br />I feel I have to give Gollum's Song it's own paragraph.  It is one of the most haunting songs that I have ever heard.  It begins with a sad melody soon accompanied by the haunting words of what must be a pitiful creature.  But there is an edge to it that builds.  Pity turns to anger, anger to vengeance.  But it is all so increidbly subtle.  The tone of the song hardly shifts at all, but I felt all of these emotions vividly.  <br />Enough gushing.  Buy this soundtrack.  It's better than its predecessor, and that alone is saying a lot.
0393320928|4.0|This book is the follow-up to Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman: Adventures of a Curious Character and I recommend that it should be read only after reading that volume.<br />The book is organized as a series of loosely related chapters that illustrate Feynman's unique perspective and his ways of interacting with the world. It is less personal than the preceding book in that some of the chapters are more about science-related topics and less about Feynman. Some of the chapters fill in details that were introduced in \\"Surely You're Joking\\" while others cover new topics. His description of the government sponsored independent commission that investigated the space shuttle Challenger explosion is revelatory both for its insight into the process and workings of such commissions (and Feynman's frustrations with them) and for his description of his own style of investigatory technique which we all can apply.<br />The reader does not have to be a scientist, engineer, or a skeptic to appreciate this book and I recommend it as informative, amusing and well worth reading.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is so amazing that many people will try and steal it. <BR>From songs such as Chic'N'Stu to the acoustic Roulette, this album gives a mix of Serj's vocals and well written lyrics. I purchased the album on the first day of release and i can say that every song on the album is wicked. I have both of the other SOAD albums, Steal This Album is a close contender to the other albums, the self titled album and Toxicity. My view on this album is that it is better than the other 2. The songs are a little short but who can complain on such a well thought album. I gave this album 5 star as that is what it is.My favourite songs are Chic'N'Stu, Bubbles, IEAIAIO, F*** The System and Roulette. If any of you havnt had the chance to buy this album then i would definetly reccommend you buy it.

B00007G1ZM|5.0|Joan is brilliant, but don't overlook the equally brilliant performance of Anne Blyth, as the world's most horrid daughter.<br />This movie is about Joan's relationship with her children and her climb to be a success because of her children. It's also a great murder mystery.<br />Poor Joan! She plays the hard-working mother, willing to sacrafice anything and everything to give her daughters all that she did not have. She loses her husband in the process and finds a job as a waitress. She keeps her job a secret to prevent her self-centered eldest, played by Blyth, from finding out. But Blyth does find out and lets her mother know in one of many successful attempts to humiliate her mother.<br />Joan survives and manages to provides for her children. Then tragedy strikes. Then Joan forges ahead with even more determination, and makes herself a success, while Blyth continues to, somehow, grow more and more selfish, while Joan tries to keep up with her daughter's greed. Watching Joan build her own successful business is a great part of the movie.
0140149295|5.0|This story reached out and touched the lives of many people.  It also made people realize not to be racist.  I know that I used to be racist and this turned my life around.  The fact that rubin was in jail for a crime he didnt commit just because he wasnt white isnt at all fair.  His story inspired me not to be racist and to get others not to hate the non-white.  It has touched many lives and i like that.  I am one of Rubin's biggest fans.
B000002BYD|4.0|On pearl jam's 5th album we find doing a more grounded,more old shcool style album. Unlike the experimental elements of \\"vitology\\" and \\"no code\\", with yeild we find a more mellow version of pearl jam, with the exception of 6 some odd songs. Of course yeild has it's share of duds, it has it's share of in my opoion, pearl jams best tunes to date. Yeild not only being one of my favorote rock albums and my 3rd favorite pearl jam album starts off with tunes such as \\"brain of J\\" and \\"faithfull\\". What better way to start off a rock/alternative album with two very impressive tunes? While \\"no way\\" reminds me of something off of vitology, that song really to this day does not impress me. But \\"given to fly\\", well besides from sounding eirly like led zepplins \\"going to calliforinia\\" is awsome, with full of emotion vocals from ed vedder(as he now calls himself)and very rythimic guitars. While the middle part of the album pretty much falls into very mellow ballads, mostly acoustic oriented. Tunes such as \\"whishlist\\" \\"pilate\\", both of witch are pretty good, and wishlist as being probably one of pearl jams most flamboyant songs next to \\"even flow\\". Then you get into the later half of yeild and goes pretty much with the same formula, but definetly has some very nice tunes such as the laid back ballads \\"MFC\\" \\"lowlight\\" and \\"all those yesterdays\\". While \\"in hidning\\" as being one of my all time favorite pearl jam tunes with it's mellow/rocking formula and at the end a very neat little riff. I would definetly recomend yeild to new pearl jam fans and rock fans alike.
0375414053|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the life and times of Kate Reddy.  I could relate to the \\"Must Remember\\" lists at the end of every chapter (what mom or even woman among us doesn't have a running dialogue with herself about all the things there are to do these days?).  Only I must say, my lists are longer! ;)<br />This book will no doubt be a lightning rod for mothers of various types...but it underscores the need for dialogue about the situation of moms today...the dilemma of whether to work or not work; the fear that staying home with your kids will lead to a loss of \\"self\\"; the fear that not staying home with your kids will lead to judgment and problems with your children.<br />Still, I think if readers just go along for the ride and try not to take it too seriously, they will enjoy the book.  Pearson is a witty author and I enjoyed Kate's brisk e-mail exchanges with her friends, and with her e-mail paramour.<br />Of course, moms who work outside the home will relate the most -- the need to fake a homemade goodie for the kids' school party; the time-crunches, the guilt, guilt, guilt.<br />I found much about Kate's world to ring true for family's trying to get by today...the worrying about schools, working out two working spouses' schedules, relationship issues, and the time crunch, most of all.<br />A fun read on an important topic.<br />- Julia Wilkinson, ...
B00006CXXU|4.0|I have to admit, when I heard Christina Aguilera would be back, I wasn't really interested. She'd just be back to claim her place in the music industry with the same music as before just like Britney, Whitney, Shania, and Mariah. But just to be sure I wasn't missing on anything groud-breaking, I decided to give this album a try. Her first single off the album, Dirrty, was not that great to me, but I had a feeling she had something big in store for her fans. I previewed the album online first, and I loved it! I loved it so much that I made it my first wish on my Christmas List. I ended up finding out that my sister had boughten it for me already and I just had to hear the album once again. And that's what I did, and here is how I rated each song off of this highly recommended album:<br />1. Can't Hold Us Down: A song about female liberation is nice to hear once in a while. Not the best song off of this album but a good one to kick it off with. 3/5<br />2. Walk Away: One of my favorite tracks. Christina's trying her best to forget about an ex. The evolution from this track to the next is perfect. I give this a 4/5.<br />3. Fighter: Another favorite of mine. Christina's anger and independence is shown throughout this rock song. You'll fall in love with its' guitar riffs and hard drum beats immediately. A very deserving 5/5.<br />4. Infatuation: I remember hearing this last year and I didn't like this song so much, but you get used to it after a while. A song describing Christina's Latin Lover with a spanish guitar added for a Spanish feel to it. Not the best song but still nice and catchy. 3/5<br />5. Loving Me 4 Me: This is a nice, slow song about appreciating someone loving you for yourself without putting looks into account. A perfect song for the Stripped theme of this album. I give it 4/5.<br />6. Impossible: I like how this song begins with Christina and Alicia Keys greeting eachother and then the song begins. A nice mid-tempo song about trying to get somebody toopen up to you. 4/5<br />7. Underappreciated: Again, this isn't one of my favorite songs off of the album. Maybe to others it is, but this song of wanting more out of your love, does not fully appeal to me and I always end up forgetting about it after hearing it. 3/5<br />8. Beautiful: Great song! I'm glad it was made into a single. Very emotional and meaningful. The words off of this ballad will stick in your head throughout the day. 5/5<br />9. Makeover: This sounds pretty close to what you'd hear Pink singing. I love this song about wanting to get away from everything and everybody and re-creating yourself. Catchy song as well. 4/5<br />10. Cruz: A nice song with meaningful words to me personally. The only thing I don't understand is the title. Is it Spanish or something? They never mention the word \\"cruz\\" anywhere in the song. Hmmmmmm...4/5<br />11. Soar: Another good song. I love the voices added to the end of the song. This song is very moving and emotional. 5/5<br />12. Get Mine Get Yours: This song reminds me of some of Christina's old stuff. That's what I wasn't looking forward to. Get Mine Get Yours is a spunky, up-beat song (kinda like Dirrty) about SEX! It's not that great but it's a nice dance song. 3/5<br />13. Dirrty: Is anybody else sick of this song. This was the song preventing me from buying this album. The beat is weak, the words are meaningless, and the video makes me sick. I skip this song all the time! But you probably won't. This song gets 2/5 but don't let it prevent you from buying this album.<br />14. The Voice Within: Cute song about listening to your inner-self and following your dreams. I like it, and you should to. 4/5<br />15. I'm OK: Sad song! I get shivers everytime I hear it! I can just see a young Christina balling with tears and I can hear yelling coming from downstairs and hitting and then silence. Sad song! Very sad! Many of us may be able to connect with the deep words. A 5/5 is what this deserves.<br />16. Keep On Singin' MySong: This song is another okay one. I would have preffered for this song to not have been put on this album but I geuss Christina had to send out a message saying that no matter what anybody says, she'll keep on singing. 3/5 is what this deserves.<br />In conclusion, I am happy I gave Stripped a try. I recommend this song to anybody. It has a little bit of hiphop, r&b, rock, latin, folk, jazz, pop, dance, rap, gospel, and poetry. You've got to like one of these things, right? If so, forget all the stereotypes associated with Christina Aguilera and just \\"find a path that is your own\\".
0875428940|5.0|This is definitely my favorite deck. The artwork is excellent, colorful, and expresses the meanings very well. Wood has done a good job of adapting the deck for use by Pagans. Let me voice my one complaint first though; for some reason she has kept the Pope as the image on the Hierophant card. This has negative connotations for many Pagans and is not in harmony with the rest of the deck. As a result it stresses the negative rather than the positive aspects of the card. A High Priest or Elders card would have better expressed the positive aspects of the Hierophant. That aside though, the rest of the deck is very good. Some of the cards are virtually the same as the Rider-Waite deck (such as the Hermit and the Sun card) while others are completely different but express the same meaning in a better way. Among the best original cards is the Devil. No ugly, horned, goatish embodiment of evil here, just a very vivid and easily understandable expression of bondage to material things and feeling trapped. The Magician is another favorite, showing a mature and self-confident man wearing a stag antlered headdress and magically controlling physical manifestation (he holds the Cosmic Lemniscate in his hand). The Judgment card deserves special mention since it does away with the tired imagery of Gabriel blowing his trumpet and souls rising from the grave. Instead we see a cauldron of fire from which arises a perfected spiritual body, while a phoenix rises in the background. This perfectly expresses the true meaning of the card in terms of pagan imagery (probably derived from alchemy, but we are also reminded of the Cauldron of Cerridwen). The Minor Arcana are equally well done; most are similar to the Rider-Waite deck but are more elaborately drawn than Pamela Coleman Smith's images. The court cards are especially good and in many cases the figures are portrayed in more active poses than in some other decks. In summary, I'd say this is an excellent deck for beginners since it corresponds very well to the Rider-Waite meanings which appear in so many books. Yet the deck remains very useful for more advanced readers due to a wealth of symbolic imagery and colorful, expressive artwork. An excellent companion book for this deck is Tarot Plain and Simple by Anthony Louis which uses this deck to illustrate the cards.
0783240236|3.0|I entirely agree with Rachel of San Jose.  I speak as a Hitchcock fan, but there is no doubt that the ending to the Birds is a serious flaw in the movie.  Hitchcock experts (such as Donald Spoto) have always seemed to gloss over the weak ending.  It totally lacks credibility in the context of what has gone before.  Compare it, for example, to the much more chilling (and pessimistic) end to Du Maurier's short story masterpiece (upon which the movie was based).  A very good movie certainly, but hardly a great one, I think.
B00004WKII|5.0|This is an incredibly essential addition to Hendrix' catalog. Unlike the Doors' box set which has tunes that we allready had and didn't like, this set is really far out! It has alternative takes of Jimi's classics like &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, and &quot;Bold As Love&quot; but also has unbelievably superb live tracks such as Bob Dylan's &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, arguably the best version of this song not featured on &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. It even includes a cut from the Royal Albert Hall concert that we all secretly own a copy of. It even has old classics like &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; whcich sounds like Elvis gone mad with an electric guitar and a cover of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; that more than bettered the original.<BR>Also included is a comical take of &quot;Third Stone From the Sun&quot; in which Jimi,and presumably Chas Chandler try to record some dialog <BR>for the opening but stumble on their lines and break into uncontrolable laughter. There is also a rocking 8 minute version of &quot;Gloria&quot; which would make Van Morrison fans jealous. This is a 100% effort by Experience Hendrix, Jimi,Noel,Mitch,Billy,and Buddy. This is the best gift you could get a Hendrix fan who hasn't yet puchased or discovered this set. A real gem.
B00006CXXU|4.0|After three years aniticipating a new album release, Christina Aguilera created controversy with her new single, \\"Dirrty\\".  The album itself is perfectly crafted to resemble the newly christened \\"Xtina\\".  \\"Stripped\\" is a combination of ecstasy and aggression as she lets people know she's not a little genie in a bottle anymore.  The opening track \\"Can't Hold Me Down featuring Lil' Kim\\" is probably the next ladies' anthem for the year 2003.  Originally written about Fred Durst and Eminem constantly bad-mouthing her, this track is sure to be a number one hit if released.  The other tracks, such as \\"Infatuation\\", and \\"Fighter\\", are the only upbeat tracks on the album aside from \\"Dirrty\\".  One of my favorite tracks is \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\".  This track proves that Christina has far surpassed any revelation or rumor about her being \\"too reserved\\". While the track isn't sexually explicit, it's still one of the best songs  to have in your collection. The album is mostly dedicated to powerful ballads such as \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", \\"Soar\\", and \\"Impossible featuring Alicia Keys\\". One of the more personal tracks entitled \\"I'm O.K.\\" expresses the grief she dealt with her father and his abusive ways.  Other tracks to look for are \\"Beautiful\\", and \\"Underappreciated\\". I strongly suggest you purchase this album, 'cause Christina doesn't get any better than this!
6305508550|5.0|I bought this movie cold - Never seen it before.. <br />I was SO pleased.<br />This has got to be one of the funniest movies you have ever seen. If you work in an office enviroment, or work in the IT sector this movie is the best. You'll particularly like the gangland beating of the office printer. <br />The story is hard to describe, but if I had to I would say that it's the story of a man on his quest to do nothing... absolutely nothing. <br />I recommend this movie if you are between 14 and 50. A little younger could watch it but they probably wouldn't get the jokes - a few of which are hilariously creud.<br />Anyway you look at it you'll love this movie.
B00006CXXU|3.0|Why, you ask?  Well Pink's last effort was her first, and now Christina's is her 2nd.  Being a fan of Perry's, right off I recognize her talents and styles on the works of these younger girls (yes, I said girls).  Linda is awesome! Period.  It was Christina's and Pink's smart decisions for pulling her onboard.  However, unlike Pink, Christina lacks identity.  I've listened to this album for weeks and I don't understand her sound. In otherwords, does she know what style fits her voice best?  All the cuts sound great, but some lack that certain passion in the voice that you might hear on a Mariah or Whitney slow cut.  And let's face it - all these youngs Diva's (or wannabe Diva's) strive for that Whitney/Mariah platform.  Xtina is on her way - but she does need her own sound.  I suggest a total Linda Perry merger ala Janet Jackson - Jam/Lewis.  This would create a unified album with each song working it's way into the next.  Currently, the album works like a child playing with the radio, jumping from station to station while mother is trying to drive!<BR>Switching from Hip Hop to Rock to R&B to POP, come on, it's like a variety show via Aguilera.  Girlfriend has the chops, now she needs the style and more emotion.  <br />For all you R&B fans, skip this.  For all you crossover people, (the Hootie fans) buy this.  For the people who love Linda Perry, like me, get this.  Linda is a genius, too bad she didn't produce this entire work.

B00005MP58|5.0|I'll not bore you with more fawning over Ehle, Firth &amp; co. Suffice it to say that they are fantastic. I just wanted to quickly let people know that this 'Special Edition' DVD is the one that they should buy. Don't bother with any of the other editions that might be out there. This edition is in wide-screen mode. The audio is upgraded. And, other editions have the annoying breaks in the action from where the original A&amp;E TV episodes ended. This edition runs it all together, stopping only when you need to go from disc 1 to disc 2. This is the only way to fully enjoy this marvelous adaptation of one of the best novels in the English language. <br />There is also a short featurette about the making of 'Pride &amp; Prejudice' that is interesting if you like that kind of thing.<br />I'm both proud and prejudiced: this 'Special Edition' is truly a MUST-OWN DVD!!
0440178002|5.0|Shogun is a book which captures any reader's imagination. Clavell follows the English sailor Blackthorne, or as the Japanese call him, &quot;anjin-san&quot;, as he experiences, and is shaped by Japanese cultures, to the extent that he becomes repulsed by, and ashamed of his old crew. It is this culture, and the effect it has on Blackthorne which is one of the most beautiful aspects of the novel. The Japanese way of life was very different to Blackthorne's. Clavell demonstrates the &quot;honour&quot; it was for a samurai to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;: suicide, and the importance of formality and obedience in ancient Japan. The events are often shocking and violent, but always very profound. Clavell makes it difficult for the reader to show anything but admiration for the Japanese samurai. The culture Clavell descibes is, for me the most intreiging and powerful aspect of Shogun. This book will keep you occupied, with its length and incredible content. One of the greatest books i have ever had the pleasure to read.
B00006LSM3|3.0|I found Harrison's slide guitar work impressive as usual.  You really<BR>don't hear things that compare to Harrison's music very much.  He's<BR>definitely got his own brand of music.  The differences in his work compared<BR>to Mac's is very noticible even though they both go for a pop audience.  <br />I bought the CD the other day, and was a little<BR>surprised at how complete and well produced it was.  I was expecting very<BR>rough, incomplete, musical ideas as opposed to actual studio quality songs<BR>with complete arrangements.  I find the songs very listenable, with only one<BR>or two tracks that I end up skipping through to get to the ones I enjoy<BR>more, like....  \\"I'm a pisces fish and the river runs through my<BR>soul\\"....\\"Canadian geese .... along the bank\\".  Whatever that means. I<BR>really like Mawar Blues too (ignore spelling, I don't have the disc in front<BR>of me). <br />On the down side, Jeff Lynn is not my favorite producer for Harrison's work.<BR>It always comes off sounding too much like ELO.  But this record has fewer<BR>of those moments, thankfully.  Harrison's vocals are not as strong on this<BR>one either, but it's obvious why that's so.  Finally, there are not many<BR>identifiable hooks on this record.  But there are brief flashes of some<BR>superb guitar melodies.  All in all, I call it a draw....yeah yeah yeah.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this CD. I have to admit, I have mocked Christina and Britney in the past- it seemed that their bodies and skimpy outfits got them in the spotlight. But Christina gets major credit for her extremely incredibly voice. (She definitely beats Britney in that category) This cd is so motivational to me, and it hits home with situations in my life. I love every song, some more than others, but I enjoy the whole CD. It has been in my Cd player in my car ever since I got it! Although sometimes I feel like these pop singers use their status or sexy bodies to get them ahead, Christina has the powerful voice to back that up. Thank you for a wonderful cd!
0446530573|4.0|I just happened across this book on an afternoon trip to the bookstore.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of the 'vignettes' (for lack of a better word).  I had to purchase it at that point.<br />The recipes were an even more pleasant surprise.  Not terribly complicated, and all thus far have been really good.  <br />This would be the perfect gift for yourself, and a really interesting addition to your cookbook collection.  It definitely won't dissapoint, and is better than your average cookbook!
B00005JLWL|5.0|There should have been more advertising and hype about this movie because I think it is ALMOST better than the Matrix!!<BR>Awesome fight sequences and good acting make this dark futuristic sci-fi/action movie one of the best I've seen!<BR>Don't listen to the 'pro' (useless) critics. Go see this movie if you like action. I plan to see this movie again!
B000002UAU|5.0|In the fall/winter of 1966/1967, when alot of the press were claiming that the Beatles were &quot;dead&quot;, the Beatles responded by releasing their artistic masterpiece that knocked everyone's socks off.  This album just flows so well, and it's a joy to listen to simply brilliant songwriting - something you don't get much of these days.  Everyone knows of the revolutionary production techniques.  Unfortunately, this was probably the last time the Beatles truly worked together as a team (arguably &quot;Abbey Road&quot;).  I will probably never tire of listening to this gem.
B000002A46|1.0|I guess I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas music, because I found this album to be a travesty.  Carey (a singer whom I like and buy on a regular basis) butchers what should be simple, thoughtful, gentle Christmas  carols.  There's an excess of excess, if you know what I mean.  At least if what she were doing was real gospel (which I love), that would be thrilling.  In the case of this album, there's more shrill than thrill.
0815411839|1.0|AFTER HAVING READ THE MAJORITY OF IMPORTANT BIOS ON MM'S LIFE, I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DONALD SPOTO HAD THE ULTIMATE ADVANTAGE OF STEALING FACTS PREVIOUSLY UNCOVERED BY OTHER BIOGRAPHERS AND TWISTING THE FACTS TO SUIT HIS VERSION OF WHAT HE WANTS THE WORLD THINK HAPPENED TO MM. CASE IN POINT, BEBE GODDARD,A VERY NICE PERSON WAS HEARTBROKEN OVER THE LIES SPOTO TOLD ABOUT HER  FATHER AND NORMA JEANE.DOC GODDARD NEVER MOLESTED NORMA JEANE, THAT'S A LOT OF BOLONEY. SPOTO CLAIMED MARILYN HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH JEAN HARLOW'S MOTHER, KNOWN AS MAMA JEAN, ON MONDAY, AUGUST 6TH. BUT MAMA JEAN DIED BACK IN THE 1950'S. IT'S ON HER DEATH CERTIFICATE. EVELYN MORIARITY HAS CHANGED HER STORY SINCE HER FIRST INTERVIEW JUST AFTER MARILYN'S DEATH. OTHER FABRICATIONS INCLUDE THE LIES SPOTO TELLS ABOUT SLATZER.AT LEAST SLATZER KNEW HIS SUBJECT WELL AND HAS DEDICATED MUCH OF HIS LIFE TO HER MEMORY AND TO SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH ABOUT HER DEATH. SPOTO'S CLAIMS DEBUNKING SLATZER'S MARRIAGE WERE MADE BY WILL FOWLER & JOE JASGUAR; NEITHER OF WHOM WERE IN ANY POSITION TO KNOW WHAT SLATZER OR MM DID IN 1952 (FOWLER, WHO CLAIMS, BUT DID NOT GHOST-WRITE SLATZER'S BOOK; THE LIFE & CURIOUS DEATH OF MARILYN MONROE,NEVER MET MARILYN. JASGUR, ALLEGES HE SHOT MODELING PHOTOS OF NORMA JEANNE IN THE LATE 1940'S.IN SOME OF THESE PHOTOS WHICH WERE TAKEN AT THE BEACH OF NORMA JEANE & ACTORS FROM A LOCAL PLAYHOUSE,THERE IS A MAN WEARING A SUIT WHO APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHER. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THIS MAN HAS NEVER BEEN IDENTIFIED. DOES ANYONE EVER RECALL SEEING ANY OF JASGUR'S PHOTOS OF NORMA JEANE ON ANY MAGAZINE COVERS OR ADS FROM THE 1940'S?). IN SLATZER'S LAWSUIT AGAINST SPOTO, BOTH FOWLER & JASGUR LIED ABOUT KID CHISSELL.JASGUAR COULDN'T EVEN IDENTIFY CHISSEL'S PHOTOGRAPH AND KNEW LITTLE ABOUT HIM. IN SPOTO'S INTERVIEW TAPES OF PAT NEWCOMB, WHITEY SNYDER AND OTHERS,YOU WILL NOT HEAR WHITEY SNYDER OR PAT NEWCOMB SAY ANYTHING DERROGATORY ABOUT SLATZER OR DEBUNK HIS MARRIAGE TO MM. IN THE SPOTO INTERVIEW WITH WHITEY SNYDER,WHEN SNYDER MENTIONED THE NAMES OF SLATZER & BOBBY KENNEDY, THE TAPE GOES BLANK. SPOTO CLAIMED THE TAPE JUST RAN OUT.CONVENIENT. PAT NEWCOMB, WHEN DEPOSED, STATED UNDER OATH SPOTO NEVER ASKED HER ABOUT SLATZER. HOWEVER,ON THE SPOTO/NEWCOMB INTERVIEW TAPES AT THE ACADEMY LIBRARY IN L.A., PAT LISTENS WHILE SPOTO TELLS HER ASSORTED LIES ABOUT SLATZER AND OTHERS.THIS AUTHOR PRESENTED NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT MM AND JOE WERE TO BE REMARRIED.I UNDERSTAND FROM RELIABLE SOURCES, SPOTO DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE PRIVATE PAPERS OF MARILYN MONROE AS HE CLAIMED.HE DID NOT PRESENT LIMOUSINE RECEIPTS OR ANY OTHER RECEIPTS THAT PROVED SLATZER OR ANYONE ELSE WAS LYING.THE MM TELEPHONE BOOKS WERE THE SECRETARIAL PHONE BOOKS, NOT PERSONAL ONES.THE SO-CALLED SMOKING GUN CHECK  THAT PROVED SLATZER DIDN'T MARRY MM, WAS A XEROX COPY OF A CHECK THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN ALTERED.IF SPOTO HAD REAL PROOF OF THESE ALLEGATIONS HE COULD HAVE SHOWN THE ORIGINALS IN HIS BOOK SINCE SLAMMING OTHER AUTHORS WAS SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF IT. JEANNE CARMEN WAS NEVER A STRIPPER OR IN ANY PORNO FILMS AS SPOTO ALLEGED IN HIS INTERVIEWS.SPOTO NEVER OFFERED ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE JEANNE CARMEN DIDN'T KNOW MARILYN. JEANNE CARMEN IS A NICE LADY WHO RAISED THREE CHILDREN AND DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE LIBELED.MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE ANTHONY SUMMERS SUCCESSFULLY SUED DONALD SPOTO IN A LONDON COURT.IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I AM SAYING ABOUT THIS AUTHOR AND THIS BOOK, GO TO THE ACADEMY LIBRARY IN LOS ANGELES AND CHECK OUT THE INTERVIEW TAPES ALLEGEDLY USED TO WRITE THIS BOOK. THEY ARE IN THE SPECIAL COLLECTIONS DEPARTMENT.IT'S WORTH THE TRIP TO HEAR HOW THIS EGOTISTICAL AUTHOR WILL RANT ON ABOUT OTHERS. ON THE TAPES,YOU WILL HEAR FOR YOURSELF THAT THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN TO SLAM OTHERS WITH LIES AND TO CREATE CONTROVERSY JUST TO SELL BOOKS, AT ANY PRICE. ON THESE TAPES,YOU'LL HEAR HOW SPOTO LIED TO, AND ABOUT OTHERS. IF AN AUTHOR HAS TO LIE ABOUT FACTS IN HIS BOOK JUST TO SELL COPIES, HE'S STOOPING PRETTY LOW...AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MR. SPOTO DID IN HIS TOME!
B000002MUW|4.0|The producers: Babyface, Dallas Austin, Dave Hall and Nellee Hooper.<BR>With such a line up of producers ain't too hard to tell what kind of direction Madonna took her career to back in 1994.<BR>She experimented so much, it felt real good get this treat from her.<BR>The album: it contains two worldwide hits (SECRET and TAKE A BOW), a couple of minor hits (HUMAN NATURE and the Bjork co-written titletrack - very ambient dance stuff...), but in my eyes the best moments off this CD are some unreleased as singles songs: FORBIDDEN LOVE is a superb Babyface work, SURVIVAL reminds me of the early Madonna dancefloor days, INSIDE OF ME is a beautiful electronic sad track and LOVE TRIED TO WELCOME ME is the bitter reflection of someone who can't get hold of love for good.<BR>Probably one hell of an under-estimated work of art...
B00006LFGD|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Barbra Streisand's.  I guess you could say it's hereditary!  I have every cd she has ever put out, but one, which is out of print, so that makes over 50 cd's I own of her music alone.  Personally, I find it hard to remember EVERY song on EVERY cd, so I really enjoyed hearing all the duets on one cd, and a few I didn't remember hearing before.  I read all the other reviews (35) first, before I wrote mine.  I noticed people picking what songs they did or did not like, but I personally think you would be hard pressed to find a voice that equals hers, so I think anyone that would sing with her would have to be truely brave!  I analyze enough things in my life as it is, and I listen to music to enjoy it, and she is in the top 3 of singers I equate with heaven, the other 2 being Vince Gill, and Trisha Yearwood.  All 3 of them give me goosebumps when they sing, while other singers I just enjoy their music.  I did read on her web site that she will be releasing a new cd next year.  People's priorities change, her husband and family is her priority now.  I'm glad to see she is happy in her life.  This is America, so you can choose to buy or not buy what you want, just like you can focus on the negative or the positive, hence reviewer's comments, but in the end, it's how you feel that will dictate. The fact that her career has lasted SO long says something, but personally, I don't think she is done surprising us!  She may not do anymore concerts, but that still leaves movies and cd's.  I wouldn't count her out yet!
B000002AVF|3.0|I'll grant it to you guys: this album was recorded while Mariah was going through a difficult time, her relationship with Tommy Mottola breaking down and everything.<BR>But this album...man! You can't be that dark-mooded.<BR>I really like some tracks: UNDERNEATH THE STARS and WHEN I SAW YOU.<BR>The duet with Boyz II Men is heaven-sent and ALWAYS BE MY BABY is the one track that delivers some uptempo joy.<BR>MELT AWAY is the finest track off the whole album.<BR>The rest is simply fillers...<BR>Mariah get back to uptempos!...
B000002H97|1.0|This album is what made me lose all faith in the former gods of speed metal.  I remember when I first bought it, and so excited for the first listen, I was quickly so disappointed!!!  This piece of garbage should never have been released.  A whole cd goes by without a redeeming second.  If you want real metal, stick to Slayer, Testament, Megadeth, or even Manowar.  This album is useless, get \\"Puppets\\" or \\"Lightning.\\"
0792845684|5.0|I think this was the best movie that Kurt Russell has ever done before. Kurt and John Carpenter work very well together and have had a lot of successful films together. But altogether this was the best. Snake Blisken(Kurt Russell) is a very cool character on the screen and is great entertainment. I've always thought that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell who he is today. Snake Blisken was a great success for Kurt, he is the only one in this world who could ever play the role of Snake Blisken. <br />I have noticed that they have changed the cover for this film, and I think it was interesting, but not good enough. I thought that the original cover looked a lot better than what it is today. The older cover had a picture of the statue of Liberty falling in the middle of the street, where Snake Blisken has the President leaning on his shoulders and his mates \\"The Brain\\" with his women, shooting at the prisoners of New York. And the newer one has fire surrounding Snake Blisken with the statue behind him dropping, and has Snake Blisken on his nees with a machine gun in his hands(CHEAP). Come on, if your smart you can see that the older cover shows more information about the theme of the storyline. Even on DVD they have it with the newer cover. Oh well, but hopefully some day they will have a Special Edition set on VHS and DVD with Escape from New York in the original better looking cover. I think they would make more money off doing that, because if they had that, I would get it right away.

B000001EHS|3.0|When you talk about Def Leppard you can't think but associate the guys with legendary producer Mutt Lange.<BR>It is no surprise that most of the material included here (and the best, i'd dare say) it's his.<BR>The collection relies heavily on the singles off their 2 most successful albums: ANIMAL is the one track that got me into Def Leppard's music. <BR>Still has a great part in my Summer 1987 memories<BR>HYSTERIA and LOVE BITES are the power-ballads that bring emotions to this disc, along with HAVE YOU EVER NEEDED SOMEONE SO BAD?.<BR>POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME is the most explicit song..honey and skin and all that's in bwetween...<BR>And then WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDES marks the new DL direction.<BR>Some tune are embarassing..ROCKET and MAKE LOVE LIKE A MAN just plain ..., but most of the rest is good.<BR>The band shows that there is more than the Queen coming from England for all the world to see..LOL
B00006F2TV|4.0|This movie is great. its my 2nd favorite movie(my first is edward scissorhands) tobey maguire is great in it, and so are all the other actors/actresses. only one problem, the ending [is not good]. Buy this movie
B00006M183|4.0|best album since yield.. ten, vs, vitalogy, yield and no code are all great albums and this one is no exeption. some very very good tracks like I Am Mine, Get Right, Save You, Love Boat Capitan. overall Riot Act is a very solid album but isnt quite as good as their previous efforts (bar Binaural). still definitely worth the cash if your a pearl jam fan though. <br />And one more thing.. I dont need to see mtv videos to convince me that pearl jam is a very, very, very good rock band. In my oppinion the best band of the 90s.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink-182 is my favorite band of all time. The music is pure punk rock. Very catchy songs, and Has alot of swearing, but you can get an edited version. BUY THIS CD. ITS NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 12 THOUGH. just my opinon though.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not only is this, in my opinion, Radiohead's best album, I think it's one of the most incredible I've ever heard. The music is so powerful, moody, and soulful- it's intense, without giving you no pause for breath- it's emotional, even spiritual, without denying the mind- eminently quotable lyrics, I assure you- and it's all so cleverly arranged, hovering on the serrated edge of perfection, and if you're ever bored, check out the references in the lyrics. They poured so much feeling into OK Computer... it was, and is, the times- play Paranoid Android, and Electioneering, and think about modern politics. Then play Climbing Up The Walls and be thankful Ashcroft never sang with such plaintive, frenzied sweetness, or we'd be even worse off.<br />I'd read this album was recorded in a haunted house, and I don't know if that helped put this sort of lonely, eerie spirit into things, but OK Computer definitely goes beyond into something.<br />I really did buy it three times- once it was stolen, so I replaced it with the cassette. The cassette wore down, so I bought a new CD. I seriously cannot live without this album. I'm a fickle Gemini, and tire of CDs quickly, but there's songs and angles and touches of magic here to suit any mood- rage at the world, despair, quiver in terror, shake your fist at the sky and vow you WILL triumph, savour that last bit of hope, die and be reborn, or simply pull an Arthur Dent and shake your head at life's confusion and stagger on, regardless- it's all in here.<br />And for all you myth-kin, I think you'll find \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" has a special appeal. I know it helped me get through some times. Plus, any album that successfully combines Hitchhiker's Guide refs with 1984 refs- well, it's just got to be awesome.<br />I know this sounds absurd, but... this album. It's not just an experience. It's the soundtrack to my life.
0061020710|4.0|Discworld is a great imaginative world which pokes fun at sci-fi novels and everything around, and it all starts here. In the first book Rincewind is drawn by Fate to lead an eager tourist and inn-sewer-ants salesman, Twoflowers, around his home of Anhk-Morpork. However, as usual to Rincewind's luck, they find themeselves in a little trouble and end up in most crazy situations such as flying dragons, soul-eaters, and even the risk of falling of the planet. <BR>This is an insane parody, and the only science fiction I read, that launched the incredable world and undenible humor from the mind of Terry Prachett. My particular favourite scene is where Rincewind ends up &quot;inside a dragon&quot;... or so he thinks...<BR>My only gripe with this novel is that this version has abandoned the beautifully painted front cover illustrated by the late Josh Kirby; instead utilizing the horrible cover you see above you so it loses a mark. Try to find the Discworld novels with Kirby's artwork on them, some of his work is just as compelling as the actual stories are.
0786868694|5.0|This is one beautiful book!  The recipes are well laid out, the instructions are clear, there are enough pictures to give an idea of what the food should look like (and to crank up the anticipation of eating!) AND Nigella's personality is there on every page-she writes the way she talks, and makes this cookbook a pleasure to actually sit and read-not just flip through for recipes.  I've often scribbled notes from her show, and appreciate having many of the recipes here.  I've made several dishes from the show, including pavlova, and bitter orange cake, and will be using this book as a resource for more great meals.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I bought the single because it was 99 cents and I was curious as to what these girls sound like. I played the CD a few hours later (because I forgot I bought it!) My cousin was here and once we began playing the CD we burst into laughter. It was most crazy thing I've heard. It sounded like monkey's on fire screaming for help. But the chours was so darned catchy that it was stuck in our heads for at least two more days.<br />So I so t.A.T.u's CD in the store and it was cheap so I thought, why not. I bought it. The first time I played the CD it pretty much sounded like monkey's on fire. I played it more and read the lyrics and I guess it began to grow on me. I'll say I didn't realize every song was about lesbians when I bought it, but love is love. I guess. This CD kind of darker feel to it that I usually like, but yeah it's good.<br />So i closing this CD is pretty good. Very catchy, it gets stuck in your head. The best songs are How Soon Is Now? and Malchik Gay.<br />Finally everyone should buy the new S Club CD because they are pretty cool yes they are.<br />=0)

B00003CXC6|5.0|Akira Kurosawa, known as one of the greatest directors of all time, got international attention with this film, that opened up the Japanese film market to the world. Released in 1950, this film, along with the director won many coveted awards. The story is simple, but at the same time the film is very complex. Tajomaru, a bandit, played wonderfully by the great Toshiro Mifune, is accused of raping a woman, and murdering her husband, in the woods. Tajomaru, the woman, a witness, and the man himself (speaking through a medium) tell their version of the events. The thing is each one tells a different story, with their own perspective on the events, and perception of those involved. So as each story is told we go into flashback and see the different events, and how the characters act differently. <br />The film from a technical standpoint is perfect, with innovative use of the camera, and editing. Acting is done superbly, with each actor, playing a slightly different version of their characters in each flashback. The script cannot get better, based on two short stories. The film is very serious, and is a meditation on the nature of truth.Its about how truth is relative, and how we each have a different viewing of events, tastes, and concepts. It is also about how each person makes up their own truth, lies, to deceive themselves. Our ego is so big we need to comfort it, and keep it safe from harsh reality. In all this film is perfect, and is even sometime called Japan's Citizen Kane, in the way it impacted Japanese filming. The two films have many similarities. If you enjoy serious films, investigating the nature of truth, and ourselves, see this film. 5 stars.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Soundgarden were good, Rage were the best. Audioslave are somewhere in between. This debut album manages to combine factors from both of the previous bands whilst never actually sounding like either of them.  Their music is still heavy with monster riffs in parts and still contains some of the weirdist noises you will ever hear a guitar make, but the remaining 3 members of Rage have proved that they can calm down and play good melodic rock music as well, which suits chris cornell perfectly.  Standouts include the first single 'cochise' which contains powerfull riffs which are rage like but also a calmer last verse/bridge which is fantastic, 'Gasoline' which is brilliant mix of everything these 4 musicians are capable of, and 'exploder', 'There was a man who had a face;that looked alot like mine; i saw hiim in the mirror and; i found him in the street; and when he turned away; i shot him in the head; then i came to realise; i had killed myself.'Classic! absolutely brilliant work by chris cornell.  Also the beats provided in 'hypnotise' by brad wilk make it possibly the coolest song in the history of the world. This album is right up there with 'by the way' and 'ideas above our station' as one of the best albums this year.
6305078491|4.0|Carl Dreyer, one of Scandinavia's finest directors, brought this film to the screen in 1932. It is image driven, with not a lot of dialog. Dreyer creates a number of scenes, with the atmosphere raised to the peak, with scary music playing throughout the film. We see Allan, an occult researcher staying at a house. He sees some very scary, werid things there. It seems vampires are controlling the people there, and it is up to him to save them, destroy the vampire, and escape. We follow him investigating the gothic home, with images of death in every room. In one scene he dreams of his own burial! We don't see much of the vampire though, mostly the haunting effects it has on the residents. This film is really creepy, and atmospheric. I'd recommend it highly to those who enjoy the old style, slow, spooky, gothic horror films. 4 stars.
B000069AUI|5.0|I thought &quot;Parachutes&quot; was a good album, though a little downbeat.  But Coldplay really know how to come back with a brighter, quicker masterpiece.  I feel like this album is very sincere and a terrific listen.  You have my recommendation.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Considered to be one of the best films of all time, and Federico Fellini's masterpiece, this 1962 autobiographical account of a burnt out film director, is perfect in every aspect. From direction, acting, script, cinematography, dialog, etc etc, there can be no improvement. We follow Guido who is trying to make a film, but lacks inspiration, and cannot focus or find answers, as everyone in his life frustrates him. The world confuses him, as he is confused inside himself as well. He uses fantasies, and past memories, to confront his hectic situation, and come out with meaning, and understanding. This film can be confusing, as the film goes from reality, to the subjective fantasies of Guido, at any moment. If you pay attention, you will see what is real and what isn't. There is a lot of philosophy and reflection. Overall this is a very meaningful film, and rewards multiple viewing, and offers different interpretations. Recommend if you can handle alternative types of films. 5 stars.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch, following in the lovely tradition of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is a fine example of dark British comedy. It is a comedy of errors and unbelievable coincidences. Brad Pitt is actually extremely good in his role as the \\"Tinker\\" boxer. This film allows the viewer in the United States a lovely insight into the underworld of British society: a tasty treat.
0790729628|5.0|Directed by Ridley Scott in 1982, this film based on a novel by the great reality bender Philip K. Dick, is a visual and mental assault mixing retro-futurisitic gothic dystopic scenery, and a thoughtful story of an android meeting his maker, and the cop trying to kill him. Harrison Ford, plays Decard, who is a Blade Runner; that is his job is to kill robots that live illegally on Earth. During his investigation he falls in love with a mysterious woman.... As Decard investigates, the two surviving illegal robots, hatch a plan to meet the man who engineered them, in order to prolong their current life span, which is only 4 years. What will these humans and robots learn of themselves, and their nature? Of reality? Love? God? Death? Technology? All of these issues are explored and more. Any fan of science fiction, or a thought provoking story should see this immediately. While there are action scenes, the film is sometime slow, so if that bothers you, then maybe you should reconsider watching this. But I suggest you do, as it is worth the effort. 5 stars. A must see.ushing Tyrell's eyes back into his head), which I felt, ruined the overall enjoyment of the film.  I was annoyed at the lack of extras on this DVD, as well as the sound, which is a standard Dolby Surround track.  But the picture quality makes up for everything.  Thanks to anamorphic enhancement, which allows an incredible amount of detail into the picture, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; now looks better than ever!  I'm suprised people were dissapointed in it.  I would give this DVD 5 stars, had they included extras of any kind.  That annoyed me, yes, but the picture quality is stunning.  I heard that they are preparing a special edition of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; for DVD.  That would be great, although I am quite content with the existing version.  I also heard they are preparing a special edition of Ridley Scott's &quot;Legend&quot;.  It was torture watching the American version, and would be more than happy tosee Scott's vision of what the film should be!
B00005JL96|2.0|Okay, so Lilo &amp; Stitch is one of their more original movies lately (as opposed to the current trend to make sequels from their classics), but it was depressing, mean-spirited and just downright sad. What does the Disney Corporation have against two parent families? Why make a movie about a monster whose sole purpose for existence is to destroy? Yes, yes, little girl tames wild beast, but come on.  And the scenes with her sister were downright scary.  The screaming... yes, it is rather reminiscent of many sisterly fights, but do we need to see that in a cartoon?  <br />Disney needs to go back to making the people look real. Why the exaggerated features? Look at Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and Cinderella. Why are those movies still so widely loved? Because of the absolute *artistry* contained within. That would be nice to see from Disney. Move away from the computers and get back to drawing. <br />So, Lilo &amp; Stitch, original, but depressing. Don't bother.
630204135X|5.0|Another masterpiece from Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, this dark psychological study of two woman undergoing an existential crisis, is renown for great acting, directing, and a great script. Alma is a nurse assigned to watch Elizabeth, an actress who will not speak even though neither physically or mentally ill, at a beach house isolated from the hectic city. At first Alma gets along very well with Elizabeth who seems to listen to her, and her problems as she talks about her past and ideas of life. But soon, Alma see Elizabeth's dark nature, and is even more disturbed to find how similar she herself is to Elizabeth. <br />This film is great, winning awards for both actresses, and for the direction by Ingmar Bergman. The style is very experimental, and always presents itself to let you know it is a film you are watching. There is a lot of difficult topics in this, and Bergman, and the two actresses handle it wonderfully, presenting the ideas clearly and very effectively. The film's intriguing story sucks you in, and builds suspense in you. Even though you can understand the film with one viewing, multiple viewing will reveal more layers, and encourage discussion. If you enjoy serious films looking at existential topics, with psychological depth, I'd highly recommend you check this out. If non-conventional films with big concepts hurts your head, stay away. 5 stars.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Not only is this a very entertaining and funny movie, it contains food for thought. As I watched Bill Murray's character go through the stages of grief at the discovery that he is stuck in the same day over and over, I realized this is a parallel to our lives. We have our own days to live over and over, but we choose how we will live them and what we can gain from the time that we have.
B00002ND77|5.0|In my opinion, \\"X\\" is not only Spike Lee's greatest film to date, but also one of the greatest, and most sophisticated films Hollywood has ever seen.  This movie was released in the fall of '92 to critical acclaim not only for Lee, but for every other actor (Denzel Washington, Al Freeman, & Delroy Lindo) and actress (Angela Bassett, & Kate Vernon) who stared in it.  The film grossed nearly $50 million in its theatrical release, and was nominated for two Academy Awards.  <br />Having said that, I must point out that the film is based \\"loosely\\" on \\"The Autobiography Of Malcolm X.\\"  I say loosely because Lee took it upon himself to tell the story of Malcolm X from his viewpoint, instead of sticking to the actual events that transpired in the book.  However, \\"X\\" is still a masterpiece, and although fictional at times, it's still one of the most heartfelt stories I've ever seen captured on film.<br />It's definitely a MUST HAVE!!
B000002A46|5.0|...  <br />This record is a great X-mas treat, it would make a special gift to anybody: mom, dad, boyfriend, step-dad, step-mom, brother in prison.  (You get the idea, I'm sure).  Carey has an awesome voice, that much is indisputable about the lady.  She makes the X-mas classics completely her own, using her grace, charm, style, and of course, her splendid vocals.  Spice up your X-mas with Mariah!!!<br />Check out her cover of Leppard's \\"Photograph\\" sometime.  It betters the original by a mile!!!<br />Mariah Christmas!!!
B000002IU9|5.0|As they themselves stated in &quot;Metal Daze&quot; so many years ago, Manowar is a social wedge.  Not that many people are on the fence about this band.  Love them for all their hairy chested, macho power, or hate them as cheesy wackos who belive their own hype.  If you love Conan the Barbarian or 13th Warrior, if you've read Beowulf more than twice, you'll probably love this band.  If you're tired of the endless, undifferentiated, overprocessed metal that is rampant today, but have fond memories of groups like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, this might just be the thing.  Yes, Manowar has its moments of overblown bombast and sometimes verges on the absurd, but the quality of the musicianship is hard to deny.  On this record, as well as all their other releases, they show you unvarnished emotion and dedication to a vision.  It's always easy to pick on a true believer.  Give &quot;Triumph of Steel&quot; a chance, though, and you might find yourself &quot;melted down and reforged in the fires of true heavy metal&quot;.  Could be fun.
B00000I07P|5.0|80s thrash metal never got better than Jovi's only masterpiece, the aptly titled \\"Slippery When Wet\\"!!  The album joins a short list of only two other 80s records - Leppard's \\"Hysteria\\" and Roses' \\"Appetite for Construction - that qualify as being classic.  Everything else was just mere imitation, pure junk.<br />\\"Slippery\\" begins with an ode to \\"High 'n Dry\\" by Leppard, with the thrash-imposing, operatic sound of \\"Let it Rock,\\" which indeed lived up to its heavy name.  Pop fare such as \\"You Give Love...\\" and \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" only tell half the story of this juggernaut.  Yes, they're good songs, but they don't display the normal hardcore brutality that this band so regularly pounds out.  Still, on the softer side, pretty love ballads like \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" opened a whole new genre of metal - the love-metal ballad.  As I said before, poser bands like Poison, Warrant, Whitesnake, and Kix attempted such love balladry - and utterly failed.<br />If you like Jovi, check out some of these artists: Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, Santana, Matchbox 20, Goo Goo Dolls, Jimmy Eat World.<br />ENJOY JOVI!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000OUW|5.0|Louder than Hell is really a proper title for this release.  This is the loudest, hardest and most unrelenting release from these long-time metal gods.  Manowar goes for the simple, brutally powerful beauty of power chords and lots of double kick drum thunder here, and to good effect.  If you can sit still and not feel like kicking some ... with this disk on, perhaps they should take you out back and bury you.  If there was ever a disk to get hyped up for weight lifting, this would be the one.  Manowar shows us nothing new, other than a new shredder at the guitar post (the capable Karl Logan).  Courage, the ballad/heroic ode of this disk, might seem a bit odd to some of you who've not been indoctrinated into the ways of Manowar, but you'll end up humming it in the car one day, mark my words.  Not as powerful as \\"Triumph of Steel\\" (lacks the mighty Rhino's drumming), as classically Manowar as \\"Kings of Metal\\", or as wonderfully \\"True Metal\\" as \\"Hail to England\\", but a must-have for both fans and newcomers to the Manowar world.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Finally, after years of record company fighting, Nirvana has released a tight disc of all their essential grunge-rock classics - their greatest hits, if you will.  <br />And it's long overdue.<br />Since their regular albums were always frought with major problems, it's good to have just one disc with all their radio hits, classics like &quot;Smells Like Teen&quot; Spirit&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are.&quot;  <br />Though they'll never match the level of the Foo Fighters (Nirvana's old opening/partner band), Nirvana still had a good run back in the early 90s.  How many other bands can claim they started a little known movement known as &quot;punk rock&quot;?  Not only that, but they also began the underground grunge movement, which has been carried on even today by the likes of better bands like Creed, Nickelback, and Limp Bizkit.<br />Well, thanks a lot.....
0385508417|4.0|Grisham delivers a modern Christmas tale that is fun, quirky and delivers it's moral message with a perfect touch!!<br />This is the story of an accountant and his wife and what happens in their lives when they decide that they would like to do something different from their traditional Christmas celebration.They choose instead to celebrate by going on a cruise with the money not spent on their traditional Christmas celebration.  While they acknowledge the importance of the birth of Christ, they have decided not to decorate, do gifts or the myriad other things people do during the Christmas season. As they strive to accomplish their goal, the pressure they get from their friends, neighbors and co-workers mounts steadily, yet they stay strong in their resolve. Manners evaporate and kindness seems to be in short supply on all sides. Feelings are bent and bruised and attitudes take a turn for the worse!<br />Suddenly an unexpected event occurs and the manner is which Grisham works out the situation is wonderful. This is a terrific Christmas story that shows the importance of tolerance, friendship, faith and generosity.
0738206679|5.0|I have only skipped through this book, so it's not fair for me to rate it. however, i have studied several original papers by Barab&aacute;si & his team at notre dame (on which this book is based) & they are among the most exciting/thought-provoking things i have ever read. they set me thinking about all sorts of things about systems & their efficiency vs vulnerability, technology & its achille's heel and our civilisation that builds on such technology. (I actually committed an act of theft & stole my office's library copy of the issue of Nature that features one of their 1st papers on the front cover in 2000! i did secretly return the copy 6 months later.) I think an entire political sociology could be built on 'scale-free' network mathematics, or it already exists in the works of Gramsci & foucault but now you have the mathematics for it.<br />some of my 2 cents worth of preliminary conclusions from my thinking, though they are not necessarily Barab&aacute;si's: scale-free networks are the type developed in virtually all important global communication technology and they are super-efficient and robust against internal malfunctioning. but they are vulnerable to attacks from outside. This is the type of technology on which the US & its allies with the most advanced economies are based & they are most vulnerable to 'terrorist' attacks. Islamic Jihadists have figured this out intuitively in their choices of attacks (e.g., WTC) and their network organisation (e.g., running sleeper cells with almost no connection with each other. This by definition, hampers their efficiency, by scale-free network logic.)<br />If these Jihadists (or their enemies) are math-capable, they should definitely read up on scale-free networks and Barab&aacute;si.<br />Hope i am not completely off the wall. I actually propose this as a PhD thesis, but (un)fortunatley, have been rejected.
0767827902|4.0|To call a movie plotless sounds negative, but in the case of The Last Picture Show, there's so very little plot that it's barely worth speaking about.  The film revolves around a number of characters, most notably two high school seniors.  Duane is dating the \\"only beautiful girl in town\\" and Sonny is carrying on an affair with a married woman.  Several other characters move in and out of view, notably the beauty's mother and the owner of the pool hall.  The film carefully develops its dozen or so main characters and simply watches them as they move about the bleak-looking desert town.  Further adding to the immersion is the fact that the soundtrack consists solely of early-50's country music heard through tinny radios in the background.<br />This film was quite controversial at the time of its release for its frank (and unglamorised) depictions of sex.  Jacy sums up the attitude of sex for the teens when she tells her mother \\"I would never do that, it's a sin before marriage,\\" but later tells a college boy \\"I'm a virgin, but I don't want to be.\\"  In a small town with little to do, sex is just a form of entertainment, while 1951 morals required that it be hidden from view.<br />This is a film that cares about its characters and allows them to inhabit the setting.  The dialogue and events occur naturally, and at the end of the film, the only things that have really happened are Jacy losing her virginity, a funeral, and the high school football team gets some better linebackers.  But because you care about the characters (and the performances are universally fantastic), you care about these events that are objectively small, but which are important to the characters.<br />This DVD is not of high quality.  This may be deliberate - the film is supposed to have a hard-edged, bleak feel that might not be as effective if the film had been cleaned up for the DVD.  There is an hour-long reminiscence on the making of the film, which is interesting to watch once.  Director Bogdanovich gets the lion's share of time, but many cast members have their say as well.  Overall, it's a decent DVD, but the VHS will contain the important part, which is the film itself, and likely of the same quality.
B00005OAIE|1.0|How can this guy be mentioned in the same breath as Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, and Howie Day. His songs are unoriginal and his music is teenie-bopper top 40 cheese. Sure it remotely resembles the horrible album \\"Everyday\\" that Dave put out, but that's where the comparisons end. This guy is so over-rated. If you're 15 and in to cheese, buy this album, but if you like original acoustic ROCK (not pop) that differs from song to song, check out Jack, Dave, or Howie.
B00005JKJA|4.0|David Lynch's work has a polarizing effect on the general public.  There are those who love his efforts in film and television and those who hate it.  For myself, personally, I find that Lynch's artistry varies wildly in quality.  When it works (&quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, the 1st season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) it flows together hauntingly and beautifully.  When it fails, it tends to be merely a mish-mash of confusing, grotesque, often disturbingly violent images (&quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks:  Fire Walk with Me&quot;).<br />Fortunately, &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; is one of Lynch's better efforts.  The plot itself is has been told a million times:  the often dehumanizing effect of the Hollywood star-making machine, particularly on young women.  Familiar Lynchian themes and images pop up in this film:  innocence lost, weird-looking dwarfs, resurrected pop songs from the early 1960's, and the importance of dreams.  <br />However, the way this story is told is by no means conventional.  What appears to be a straightforward mystery about a femme fatale (&quot;Rita&quot;) eluding her potential killers and searching for her true identity with the help of an unbelieveably naive young starlet (&quot;Betty&quot;) turns out to be a deeper commentary on the meaning of self, particularly in the cutthroat environs of Hollywood.<br />The first time I saw &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; I was totally confused, but a second viewing cleared up most of its mysteries.  It's fun to watch a film where the director is one step ahead of the audience.  If you fancy a familiar story told in an unfamiliar fashion, you'll enjoy this movie.<br />Conversely, if you're the type of person who prefers a movie with a beginning, a middle, and an end (i.e., a conventional story structure), &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; is not for you.<br />Once again, David Lynch polarizes the masses.
B00002SSRZ|2.0|This DTS sounds terrible. The surround is done well -- probably from the Quadraphonic version -- but the mastering is really &quot;thin&quot;, almost as bad as a CD. If you want a good-sounding DTS, try the Eagles' &quot;Hotel California&quot; or the Grateful Dead's &quot;American Beauty.&quot;
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I'm not a 'Spice Girl' fan, but their song 'Spice Up Your Life' is more latino than what she did with this album and better.  Maybe she should go get lessons from them and I think all of them should go and get singing lessons together.
0316666343|5.0|This book is about Susie Salmon, a girl who was murdered at fourteen. The book focuses less on her murder and more on her life. You follow along with her as she looks on from heaven at the people that affected her while she was alive. The book made me laugh and cry many times over. It grips you at the first sentence. It was one of the best books I have ever read.
0596000480|3.0|I am new to JavaScript programming and Webprogramming in general. This book was very hard to read and understand if you dont have some experience writing JavaScript. As a reference book this book is great but as a learning tool for beginners I think its terrible. I have only gotten to the third chapter so far and I had to go back to reading my 21 day JavaScript book in order for me to work up the the Definitive Guide. I think they should've added several chapters and tutorials for beginners so the beginners can get something out of this book as well. <br />If you are a beginner or are a person that needs hands on experience to learn JavaScript I suggest that you get a book that has lots of tutorials and full completed examples and results and explains things thoroughly in regular words that normal people can understand. I would say this book is more of a JavaScript Dictionary than a learning tool. This book is definatively NOT for the new JavaScript programmer! I have always had good luck with the 21 day books so I will read that one first and come back to this one since my professor recommeded it and then decide if it was worth my money.
1400031346|5.0|An absolutely wonderful start to what is hopefully is a long-running detective series set in modern Botswana. This fast-reading book isn't so much a set piece mystery as it is the story of an African woman in her late thirties who stakes her entire inheritance on the crazy idea of becoming the country's first woman private detective. Precious Ramotswe is a intelligent &quot;traditionally built&quot; woman with a keen sense of human nature and a desire to help people in distress. This book tells of her childhood, her loving miner father, an ill-considered marriage to a trumpeter, her strong belief in her own abilities, and skeptical take on the forces of progress and modernization. This volume contains her first cases, which she adroitly solves with the assistance of her expert typist secretary and the local master mechanic, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.<br />But the book is not just about her, but also aims to portray a positive picture of modern Africa, one all too rarely seen in the West. The cases often intertwine with issues such as development, social structures, power, and gender, but in a disarmingly light and gentle way. Among her tasks are to find a missing husband, investigate a doctor, follow a teenage girl, and find a missing boy who may have been kidnapped by a witch doctor. None of these are particularly convoluted, and Precious's greatest difficulty often lies in determining exactly what to tell her client in order to effect the best result for all concerned and achieve cosmic justice. The stories are delivered in a delightfully fluid and simple prose with pacing that makes the book quite difficult to put down.<br />The series thankfully continues with Tears of the Giraffe and The Kalahari Typing School For Men, with further volumes to follow one hopes.
B00005KHJM|3.0|One thing I notice about contemporary films as of late is the lack of originality, creativity. We often find ourselves comparing films to another, and eventually getting tired of the same old same old as they become all to familiar. It is refreshing however to go back in the vault and retrieve a film, that possibly started it all, the first of its kind, etc. The Wicker Man, for me, is my kind of fresh escapism. <br />The Wicker Man has a very simple plot, yet is complex. Police Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) receives an unnamed letter from an island called Summerisle. The letter explains the disappearance of a girl, in which he is asked if he could investigate and hopefully solve the case. Howie, accepting the proposal, travels to the remote island and right off the bat begins his investigation. Although the seemingly peaceful community is a lot more than meets the eye. Being a deeply religious man (Christian) he begins to see the island community is one large cult, and as he digs further into the investigation, he digs further into secrets and plights he may regret. The mystery plot leaves the viewer hanging right up till the end. On which all concludes to the best ending to any movie I have witnessed.<br />As said before, the movie is highly original. As far as I can tell, it is incomparable to any movie I have seen, and with good reason. Public intercourse, cakes and candies in the shape of nurslings and humans, rituals that consist of dancing around open fires unclothed and the wearing of strange animal costumes. This, however, is only a small piece of the film cake. Also there are far more elements that are both interesting and distinctive. It utilizes bits of symbolism, with musical sequences, thrills, bizarreness, and horror- I guess variety is the spice of life. <br />The Wicker Man also introduces us to captivating performances. Director Robin Hardy clearly new what he was doing, and he got the most out of the actors he was given to work with.  Edward Woodward did a beautiful job, nailing a confused, spooked, and disgusted religious zealot right on the spot. Expressing every mood perfectly, making the performance convincing. Christopher Lee also gave a startling performance as Lord Summerisle. Creating a most subtle and clever character, delivering each line with fashion. Even the minor actors of the film all proved impressive. <br />The script was very well written. Lines of dialogue were witty yet subtle, i.e. &quot;Naturally, it's much to dangerous to jump through fire with your clothes on.&quot; And the score was very strange and different: Folk and tribal music, which fits well with the movie's theme(s). <br />The Wicker Man proves to be a worthwhile film. Combining erotica with horror, mystery to musical. It is greatly done from beginning to end. Made perfect with substance, not special effects.
B000063V8U|5.0|Alright some people say that Seasons 3-5 were the best.  I beg to differ.  I, along with the producers and the cast of the show agree that Season 6 had the most solid line-up of episodes in any season.  There wasn't hardly one episode in this season that was a stinker.  The only episode that I really didn't care for was &quot;Man of the People.&quot;  The rest were just superb.  Granted a few were a bit contrived or a bit lsow-paced at times, but for the most part, every episode in this season showcased just how good TNG had become.<br />For example, there were several good Klingon, and this time,  Romulan shows.  &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; along with &quot;Timescape&quot; were probably some of the best Romulan episodes in the entire series.  In &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; we meet Kahless, the legendary Klingon leader from years past.  In &quot;Birthright Part II&quot;, we have a somewhat weak attempt at Worf showing a bunch of Klingon prisoners what it means to be Klingon after years of captivity under Romulans.  Season 6 also integrates the Cardassians a little better since DS9 started up this same time, with episodes, &quot;Chain of Command, I &amp; II&quot; and &quot;The Chase&quot;.  And then of course the season ending cliff-hanger &quot;Descent&quot; deals with the &quot;individuality&quot; Borgs led by Lore.<br />However even the non-classic adversary episodes are nice strong Trek-ish stories involving the growing Trek universe.<br />&quot;Second Chances&quot; introduces us to William Riker's twin clone &quot;Tom Riker&quot; which was Levar Burton's directing debut.  Be sure and watch the extras on Disc 7 for more info on this episode.<br />But anyway, I would recommend Season 6 to anyone who wants to see just how great TNG really was.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album rocks!  I could have hardly imagined a better piece of work from these guys.<br />I'll tell you I was not into Cornell's stuff recently but he has managed to come alive again with the Rage boys and really put out some good sounds.  Not so much whining like he's done in the recent past.  <br />Anyway, don't let Cochise make the decision for you..........the rest of the album is even better.  If you liked Rage Against the Machine (and who didn't), you will be glad those guys are playing there instruments again for us.......yeah, good stuff!!

0553579908|5.0|I do not wish to provide a spoiler to those of you who have not read this book/series yet.<br />However, it is a well crafted book with good story, well developed characters, and will engage your interest.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I am not very fond of this cd, frankly thsi cd is nothing compared to her Spanish work, it is in my humble opinion not very good, her songs in english are not very good either. Her taste has gone down and i think that this is her worst work yet.
B00005JJX8|3.0|Suspense takes a back seat to romance as former cat burglar Grant turns detective to track down the culprit behind a recent string of jewel robberies, becoming involved with beautiful heiress Kelly during the course of his investigation.  Proof that lesser Hitchcock is still far above average, with Grant at his most suave and debonair; Kelly at her most ravishing; an engaging comedic turn by Jessie Royce Landis as Kelly's down-to-earth mother; and some sparkling (and suggestive) dialogue by John Michael Hayes.  Add in some truly beautiful costumes by Edith Head and breathtaking, Oscar-winning color cinematography by Robert Burks ... and what's not to like? Even though the mystery is a bit slight, you won't be bored!<br />The DVD offers a wonderful video transfer with crisp, clear sound and a brightly color-balanced, anamorphic widescreen picture.  There are three unique mini-documentaries about the making of the movie, featuring Hitchcock's daughter and granddaughter; a documentary about costumer Edith Head (which is being included on many Paramount 2002 DVD releases which feature Head's work); the Original Theatrical Trailer; and a truly grand assortment of vintage production stills and posters from around the world.  All in all a quite nice package that's definitely worth a look.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|i liked the cd, but it had very few songs and i really didn't care for the russian versions, i liked what they are singing i liek the lyrics but no wonder the cd is only 6.99 because it has very few songs.<BR>I think that lesbians will like this songs since they are about LEsbian Love.
B00006CXXU|5.0|5 stars - need to say no more!!!!<br />just buy it, you wont regret it
B00005YUPO|5.0|my son has loved the baby einstein series since he was 2 months old.  the colors and music keep him entertained
B00004W52U|4.0|This is some really great punk/ska. All the songs are really catchy, and the bass player is the best ever! The lyrics are also really great, and whats amazing is that they were in high school when they made this! Every song is really great, my favorites are &quot;sound system&quot;, &quot;bombshell&quot;, &quot;unity&quot;, &quot;freeze up&quot;, &quot;healthy body&quot;, ummm, every song! Just get this, you will NEVER play it out!
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt has always been the great band in the spotlight and Gwen Stefani has always been &quot;girl with the pretty vocals.&quot; But, this CD is the absolutely best by far. Hey Baby sounded just like all her other music did, but other hits on the CD had great, unique sounding music, rythm, and beat to it as well as powerful lyrics to make the music sound even better. Underneath It All sounds peaceful, relaxing, and even a bit of Reggae sounding. Hella Good is a really great dance song with an impressive beat, and again, powerful lyrics. Hey Baby was the first hit on the CD and it wasn't overplayed on the radio. It reminds me of high school, as probably does with Gwen.<BR>This CD was overall excellent, and couldn't have been better. I would totally reccomend it to anyone that loves No Doubt or is just in search of a great dance CD (or a great CD in general). This CD was surprisingly NOT depressing, like some of her previous albums. I can't wait to see the results of the next No Doubt CD, because I have always been a fan!
0736041850|5.0|Helps you visualize the muscles you are working out which makes<BR>it easy and efficient to TARGET any muscle you want. The safety<BR>tips and precautions are very informative and relevant also.<BR>Excellent book overall.
B0000039PW|5.0|This album is so good, any fan of hip-hop should get this right now.
B000002A3T|5.0|The music and lyrics are fantastic -- especially those who want to be relaxed.. pretty great stuff...
B00005JLWL|4.0|the storyline was by far out there...very strange and confusing at times....especially if u dont like to think like me...lol...but the action scenes were well worth watching...creative...numerous times i said to myself: \\"i never saw that...\\" <br />buy a 2pm showtime...enter at 2:45...you'll be satisfied<br />:)
B00005YXZH|5.0|I've seen several year-end best of lists, where this record is inevitably included. What I don't understand is how it could not be #1 on all of them. This isn't just the best record of the year, it's the best record of at least the last half-dozen years. This is a record that keeps the listener coming back for more. When I purchased this record in June, I was initially impressed, but not overwhelmed. The songs that hooked me at first were the obvious ones, the catchy &quot;Kamera&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;, &quot;War on War&quot;, &quot;Jesus,etc&quot;, and &quot;I'm the man who loves you&quot;. I tended to skip over &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot;, &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot;, and &quot;Poor Places&quot;. It wasn't until I saw Wilco live at Tipitinas in New Orleans that I realized the power of those latter mentioned songs. When the band kicked in after the final chorus on &quot;I am Trying...&quot; I felt as if I was lifted out of my body. That moment was a defining moment for me as a music fan. The moment when I changed from a casual admirer of the band to a rabid fan. After the show, I revisited the record, and heard things I had never heard before. The record became, to use Jeff Tweedy's words, &quot;A huge part of my soul&quot;. This record belongs in the company of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;OK Computer&quot;, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, &quot;Murmur&quot;, &quot;Songs from Big Pink&quot;, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, and &quot;Abby Road&quot;. In twenty years I'll still be putting the head phones on and listening to &quot;Poor Places&quot;. My only hope is that a million other people will discover this recording, and get the king of joy from it that I have experienced.
B0000028P8|4.0|This was probably one of the best MTV unplugged shows ever. Mariah belted out the songs and wowed her audience with her incredible voice. The songs are all taken from her first two studio albums *her self-titled debut and &quot;Emotions&quot;* with an added bonus of her great cover of &quot;I'll Be There.&quot; Mariah's crowning acheivement on here is &quot;Emotions&quot; which is probably one of the most vocally challenging songs of all time and Mariah nails it. Other highlights are &quot;Can't Let Go&quot; and &quot;Vision of Love.&quot; My only complaint is I really wish she would've performed &quot;I Don't Wanna Cry&quot; and/or &quot;Love Takes Time.&quot; They're two of my favorite Mariah Carey songs, but it's still a great CD anyways. A must for any Mariah Carey collection.
6304983778|5.0|My family and I love this movie.  It has humour, suspense, tenderness, a whole gambit of emotions, and puts Christmas in a good respective about giving and receiving.  The beginning gives a nice explanation of how Santa Claus came about, and the later half is light hearted and funny much of the time.  And for a 1985 movie the special effects aren't all that bad!
B00005JLWL|5.0|I though I'd never forgive Bale for Reign of Fire, but this movie is absolutely amazing!  It renders it's viewers completely speechless for hour afterwards.  You MUST see this film.  I offered ten friends a money back guaruntee and I had NO callers on my bet.  IT IS AMAZING!
B000059XUO|5.0|You cant say much about this movie except \\"MASTERPIECE\\". However it was made more real by the sad death of Brandon Lee. Knowing he died gave the film an dark feeling. But it is a great movie WATCH IT!!!
B00005JLRR|4.0|I thought it was great. Once again you must be a bit of a fan to get the best of the movie. I gave it 4 stars for a trekkie and I think if you are not you would not like it so well. <BR>Sad to loose DATA, but it seems his replacement will fair well.<BR>The ending was short and to the point. I am sad it is over and I cannot wait to see what Voyager has to offer!!
B00000JLWW|3.0|This was a great movie to see in the theater -- I saw it twice in 1997 and after the first viewing, researched the reality of the Titanic disaster and was much more moved the second time I watched the movie.  To think of over 1,500 people perishing -- and you can pull up passenger manifests online and see that entire families died together -- it was devastating.  However, this is an unfortunate movie that simply doesn't stand up to repeated viewings (apparently unless you were a 14-year old girl watching it for obvious reasons).  After watching the DVD a couple of times, it hit me that the script was REALLY quite bad.  If I had a quarter for every time Rose whines, \\"Jack, Jack, Jack\\" I could reimburse myself for the purchase price of the DVD.  I tried to find some redeeming qualities in the script, but I couldn't.  It's just not very good.  The fictional story set against the historical reality is great, but the lame screenplay writing just doesn't do it justice.  If the script was reworked into dialogue that wasn't so COMPLETELY filled with processed cheese, this could be a truly great movie.  The fact that it received an avalanche of Oscar nominations and won quite a few of them is a testament to the cultural phenomenon of the movie, not the quality of it.  Certainly, lesser films have walked away with Best Picture (how \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" beat out \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" in 2001 is still beyond me), but whether or not \\"Titanic\\" truly deserved Best Picture is one of those things that can be argued either way.  For the first viewing, I'd give this between four and five stars.  For repeated viewings, it drops considerably.
B000002X2B|5.0|This album is (for my money) one of the very best R&R records ever made...by anyone, and I mean anyone. A beautifuly constructed piece of artwork. AND STILL IS. I listen to it often, and enjoy it as much today as I did 30+ years ago.
B000066744|5.0|Another masterpiece from Giuseppe Tornatore. If you've ever watched Cinema paradiso you you can expect a movie as beatiful as that. I wish it never finished and I could sit and watch for ever. There is something different about it, It doesn't let you blink from the beginning to the end. <BR>Certainly deserves 5 stars(Actually 7).
B0000640VN|1.0|What an amazingly boring, predictable movie. Having watched this movie, I no longer suffer from insomnia. The premise is great. A time travel story with a romantic twist but it is unbelievable in its love story and I figured out the end after ten minutes of sitting through the horrible pain of watching Meg Ryan play the SAME CHARACTER I have seen her play for the past 15 years and not be nearly as appealing as she can be.  The performances are one demensional. The writing is bland. I found myself not caring what happened, I just wanted it to be over. Don't waste your time and especially your money. This movie is really one for your \\"miss it\\" list. Unless of course, your sleeping pills have not been working well.
B00006CXXU|5.0|The album is COMPLETELY different from her first, but the change suits her more than well.  The CD is very diverse, and her vocals shine in every song.  You could definitely see why she said this was a very intimate album.  I absolutely loved it, and I was not a big Christina Aguilera fan.
B00004W221|5.0|Sean Astin and comapny bring this INCREDIBLE story to life in a HUGE way. This movie will move your spirit. It is not only one of the best inspirational movies ever made but also THE BEST sports movie ever made (IMHO). I am such a &quot;real guy&quot; and I cry at the end everytime. This dvd is also quality in sound and picture. The extras are nice, I just wish there were more.
B00000064F|5.0|All of Nick Drake's music is so fantastic, so streaked with genius and beauty, it is truly a difficult task to pick a favorite album! But if I had to pick, Bryter Layter would be *it*, with the sparse and ethereal Pink Moon following closely.<br />This album is perfect, magical, full-bodied and brilliant from its opening notes to its last. At the Chime of a City Clock, Fly, Hazey Jane I, One of these Things First, Northern Sky... these are Nick's masterpieces, and they stand tall and proud against any music created anywhere, ever. The horns, strings, piano, and guitar here all come together to whip up a musical confection so sweet, and so nourishing, it's hard to imagine I'll find anything I will enjoy quite as much. When coupled with knowledge of Nick's story, his sad, difficult time in London, isolated in his flat and working so hard on this album, the album just becomes his crowning achievement. After this album, Nick was still producing (Pink Moon is truly a seminal, unparalleled album in its own right, and his last four songs reflect much of the pain and confusion he was experiencing), but Bryter Layter reflects Nick's belief that he was soon to be riding a star, and it shows. It was meant to carry him on to fame, and it is only the sad nature of fate that it took 30 years for it to happen. But it *did* happen, and for this I am very grateful to say the least (if he hadn't gained such success now, I never would have heard of him, or the story of his life.) Nick Drake was the ultimate artist, and is a true inspiration to many.<br />The elaborate and classy arrangements provide an unparalleled showcase for Nick Drake's lyrics, voice (oh what a voice) and fantastic guitar playing... some say, over-produced, I say, sheer heaven. The crackling and glowing magic of this album, now thirty years old (it was released in 1970, the second of three albums released in Nick Drake's lifetime) has made its way into the limelight, at long last, with songs from it showing up onmovie soundtracks and the album itself on many a 100 Best Albums of all times lists (alongside other Drake works, I might add, at least in Britain). <br />For Nick, \\"If songs were lines in a conversation/The situation would be fine.\\" He was shy, retiring, incredibly self-conscious. And with this music, what a conversation! Pop this album in your cd player, lay back in your favorite chair, and enjoy.
B000021YQV|5.0|I love this cd. Every song on this cd is different and is also different from any other group I have heard. I like there original cd as well and recommend it to anyone who is purchasing this cd. System of a down is awesome. Thank you and enjoy!...:)
B00000064G|5.0|If Bryter Layter, Nick Drake's second studio album from 1970, was Nick Drake's public masterpiece, complete with a myriad of fantastic guest musicians, Pink Moon, his stark and lonely and incredibly beautiful, and let's face it, 'solo effort,' is his private one.<br />The songs here are an ode to the night, an ode to solitude, to thought, to dreams, to finding a place in the world that is uniquely yours, despite the difficulties inherent in doing so.<br />Pink Moon is an ode to the mystery of life, and, as in the Volkswagen commercial, seems to carry within it this strange feeling of motion... it feels as if it is moving past you, as if Drake is, somehow, fading all the while that he is singing. It is ethereal and beautiful beyond words. The second song, Place to Be, is truly a gorgeous lullaby, and leads well into the rest of the album.<br />Other standout tracks include Parasite, with Drake's languid, barely awake voice crooning along to his brilliant guitar, the beautiful and haunting Horn, which summons up huge depths of emotion with just a simple guitar melody, (short but brilliant). This song leads perfectly into the mesmerising, guitar-driven Things Behind the Sun, the ultimate song for artists - \\"Don't be shy you learn to fly/And see the sun when day is done/If only you see/Just what you are beneath a star/That came to stay one rainy day/In autumn for free.\\" Other standouts are the tracks Which Will, a sweet, beautiful song which has been covered by the likes of Lucinda Williams, and finally, the gorgeous From the Morning, an ode to the beauty of the spirit.<br />Throughout the darkness here, there is light. Sounding patient, measured, calm, Drake guides us through his days with a reassuring hand.. he is here for a little of the journey, but at some point, he leaves us, and we are on our own, with only the music to guide us from that point on.<br />And what beautiful music it is.
B00006F83Y|2.0|Like everyone else, I was pulled in by the catchy &quot;No One Knows&quot;.  If you really listen to that song, though, it just repeats a few lines OVER AND OVER.  Unfortunately, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree on this album.  It feels like a broken record.  The &quot;Queens&quot;, in my opinion, are an overrated band getting hype for putting out something nobody else has yet.  There's a reason nobody has done this kind of music before, though:  It's not very good.
B00005JKCH|3.0|The movie was excellent, but that's not really the point. Not only is this DVD encoded with RCE (Regional Coding Enhancement, which means it *WON'T* run on many zone-free dvd players), but the bonuses are not very interesting (among others, where is the deleted scene with the twin towers ? Ah well...)<br />All in all, the movie is still great but the DVD is ..., so that averages at 3 stars in my book.
B00005JLWL|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Fast action with great effects. In truth, this fictional society could one day exist and in fact in smaller measures has with mind control drugs. That is what makes this movie work, is that even in Sci-Fi there are some possible elements of truth. No sex, No cursing, but plenty of violence and action...my kind of movie. My 16 and 20 year old boys loved it as well.....
B00006M183|4.0|Once again, the day of the release, I was at the store picking up a copy of the new album.  It has become like a holiday for me over the years.  And, once again, I wasn't disappointed.  I would give this a 4.5 out of five.  It's a great album with a solid line up of songs.  Even the B-side to the single is great.  I saw them on Letterman, fabulous.  This album will be great live.  For those of you that might be casual fans...don't expect a repeat of Ten or Vs.  It's not going to make you want to jump up and down in a mosh pit.  But what you should expect, and what we Pearl Jam fans have become used to, is a thoughtful, well written, well played group of songs with meaning and sincerity.  This album is further testament to PJ's ability to evolve, while maintaining a relevence.  Far too often we've seen bands stick around past thier prime.  These guys are too good.  I'm already waiting for the next album.  As a matter of fact, Pearl Jam is the only band I even BUY albums for anymore.  Keep up the good work guys...I'll always buy your albums.  Thanks for the memories
B0000640VO|1.0|This is a romantic comedy (aka chick flick) with extra sugar added in. By the virtue of being foreign, it is more interesting and refreshing than the usual Julia Roberts movies.<br />Yet it is even cuter, and much more childish. It has some sickly sweet quality that is hard to describe. It is a long movie where tiny little cute things happen, and Amelie just blinks with her huge eyes. This is like a funnier version of the movie Magnolia - but still there is something not-so-subtly depressing about those childishly naive and one-sided characters.<br />I went to see a movie that I had hears was good, but neither me nor my date liked it. What astounded me is that later it grew more and more famous and hyped up, and all of my friends like it!<br />By the way, camera work, colors, imagery are very good. But not outstanding enough to make the entire movie worth watching.
6304711875|1.0|Having established himself as the best and most mischievous film maker currently working in the dead-babysitter horror genre, Wes Craven (of the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' films) is in the mood for parody. So 'Scream' winks at everything from a virginal heroine in a flowered cotton nightie to 'the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life for one last scare.' Along the way, proving it's not too detached to get down to business, 'Scream' also finds time to disembowel a pretty young victim or two. Scream is Wes Craven's latest horror film with a gimmick that just doesn't quite work. It opens, in traditional slasher film fashion, with the young, pert, and alone Casey having a \\"terrifying\\" (yeah right, I laughed through the whole thing and so did my friends) encounter with a homicidal caller. The killer then sets his sights on Sidney ), a distraught and whiney whoa is me teen who has been standoffish since her mother's brutal murder a year ago. The film continues in its predictable path, as the killer moves gorily from victim to victim. The twist in Scream is that the characters acknowledge the cheesiness and predictability of horror flicks, and even outline the flaws and imperfections. Unfortunately, this self referentiality doesn't quite work, for Scream falls into the same boring and thoughtless patterns as prior movies of its ilk. Sorry people, but this movie WASN'T SCARY AT ALL! However it wasn't a complete waste of time. I did enjoy this movie, and thought that it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This film might have been scary if it hadn't made fun of itself. How do you expect a person to take a movie seriously, when it doesn't even take itself serioiusly? So basically if you're looking for a very scary and disturbing movie, look elsewhere, but if you want an enjoyable movie that you can laugh at and just have fun with, then see this.
B000001FS3|5.0|The first three tracks are so beautiful that they justify buying the whole CD. Melody, rhythm, and words interleaved in a tapestry of beauty. I heard these three songs in some random rock compilation CD -- they were so good that they kindled my interest in U2, and I have been a devoted fan ever since.<br />Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby are universal favorite CDs among U2 fans. You can't go wrong with either one.
0805047905|5.0|I just spent Thanksgiving with my grandaughter, age 2 1/2. Her parents read to her every day, continuing the habit my son grew up with. One day, Naia brought me \\"brown bear\\" and \\"read\\" it to me. Of course, she was reciting from memory, but what fun for both of us! Like others mentioned, we continued the theme, especially in the car, using Naia, Mommy, Grandma, Daddy, etc. I'll always love this book because of this special memory for me with my currently \\"pre-reading\\" grandchild.
B00005JK8K|1.0|The only beautiful scenes are the ones solely dedicated to the Navajos or their homeland. The rest of the movie is unrealistic, stupid gore. Cage kills all the baddies in effortlessly brutal ways.<br />In addition, the movie is historically inaccurate. Save for the fact that a Navajo code existed, and was never broken during WW2, everything else is ....<br />Saving grace: Adam Beach is a great actor that one gets to like more and more as the movie proceeds.
6305428042|5.0|Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy strut their stuff in this outlandish Walt Disney Picture. The three witches are brought back to life from 17th century Salem by some unsuspecting kids. It's a  night full of comic chaos when the tricky 300 year old trio set out to `put a spell' on the town and reclaim their youth. <BR>Filled with outrageous comedy and a haunting score. Guaranteed to entertain everyone!
B00000DFSK|5.0|If you are new to U2, start here. This CD offers an excellent selection of their greatest hits. Despite what hard-core fans say, these tracks define the U2 sound. Poetic and inspired lyrics. Wildly beautiful instrumental passages.<br />Most of the tracks here are of timeless quality. Feel free to refer to their original albums if you like these tracks, but don't always expect the same quality - some of them will sound dated, 80's.<br />For U2 fans like myself, this album is a good focal point of their best early work; it is a must-have one-stop shop for U2's best. I don't have space for 20 CDs in my car :)
B00005Y228|4.0|Kylies Fever album is what I call a good pop album. It isnt about anything special or isnt in it self to be taken very seriously but that is exactly what I love about it. It doesnt take on any issue it doesnt contain any weak points like wining or crying. It isnt trying to be anything that it isnt. Kylie and her people managed to create a really good album that is listenable all the way through and is good to dance to in parties and dances. Kylie doesnt have a special talent but that doesnt mean that this album isnt good and Kylie isnt being anyone shes not. Thats what I like about her and Thats what I like about her album.
B000022TT4|3.0|This is an OK film. The music selection is fine, but on some of my favorite tracks the sound quality is just no good. I enjoy it nevertheless for the multimedia experience, but they could have done some better editing/remastering.
B00005OAIE|2.0|This album is perfect for dreaming females ages 13 to 19.  Okay, so there are some catchy tunes (and by catchy tunes I mean simplistic, repeating, 3 chord wonders), but any avid music fan can tell you exactly from which artists Mayer gets his stuff from.  I bet if I try real hard, I, too, can sound like Dave!  <BR>Summary:  If your biggest worry in life is how to catch the eye of the guy you pine after in history class, buy it.  If not, be true and go get some Radiohead.
B000001DTM|5.0|You can't go wrong buying this album. All reviewers agree: it is U2's best.<br />It is their most poetic work. Mellody, rhythm and lyrics rarely mesh so well (in ANY musical genre or artist) as they do on this CD. All songs are of consistent quality, even the ones that are not famous radio favorites. This album is both dreamy and fresh, like cool late-night breeze.<br />The perfect balance of musical elements gives this album a timeless quality: it has stood the test of time, and most U2 fans love it at least as much today as the day they bought it.<br />Couple this with Best of 1980-1990, and you'll have 90% of U2's best and greatest! Only after these two CDs (which will hopefully get you hooked on) can you fully appreciate their earlier, less mature work, and their later, more experimental albums. Enjoy!
B00006CXXU|4.0|There is no denying that Christina Aguilera has gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to recognition.  We saw it when R. Kelly eclipsed the more talented Aaron Hall of Guy fame.  And we all know how Britney devoured her competitors like Godzilla at a monster buffet.  But Christina Aguilera has some genuine talent.  The girl has a powerful, soulful voice that, with \\"Stripped,\\" she is going to make sure people pay attention to.  She has grown-up.  She has suffered and matured; the proverbial phoenix has arisen to exact her vengeance on those who ignored her before, having shed her pop and diva personas.  She is serious about her music and what she gives the audience.  The album is varied in musical styling.  \\"Fighter,\\" a hard edge rock track signfying her renewed strength after a difficult relationship is like a dose of cathartic scream therapy.  I really felt like SHE felt stronger.  And it blends seemlessly with the preceeding ballad \\"Walk Away.\\"  It is tough to transition from ballad to hard rock without shocking the system, but here it felt...right.  The spanish guitars on \\"Infatuation\\" are a little too overplayed in this age, but it still gives the cliched feel of exotic tropical romance that fits the song's lyrics.  The slow tempo \\"Loving Me For Me\\" sounds like it was borrowed from Jill Scott's repertoire.  Her vocals soar elegantly above the percussion and heavy bass.  The angst ridden sound of \\"Make Over\\" is punctuated by urgent strings and reminds me of Fiona Apple's underappreciated \\"When The Pawn.\\"  I have to admit that I was skeptical before actually listening since I heard the rather dull \\"Dirrty\\" on the radio.  Even the inclusion of one of my favorite MCs, Redman, couldn't save that track from being a loud, noisy muddled mess of mediocrity.  \\"Soar\\" is an arrangement triumph.  The song is positively uplifting with its inspiring lyrics and deep soul arrangement, complete with choir accompaniment and bluesy hand claps that don't seem gimmicky or pretentious.  It gives the song the necessary depth and strength it should carry.  I think \\"Soar\\" would have been better placed as the conclusion of the album as nothing after it really can match.  Even the wavering of her voice on the emotional guitar ballad (think Jim Croce's \\"Time In A Bottle\\") \\"I'm OK\\" makes you feel a pain with her.  Not so much a sympathy as a sharing of her pain.  I thought she may have broken down while singing.  All in all, this little girl has developed into a woman with a powerful voice that I think we all could benefit to listen to.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I was curious to see what everyone was raving about, so I decided to give it a whirl.  One can't catogorize this movie; there are so many elements in it.  Teenage 80's, scifi, etc.  But I would say this is more of a - put the mystery together type of movie.  I give it credit for being original, but i can't help but wonder from beginning to end, &quot;when is this gonna end?&quot;  My girlfriend totally hated this movie.  It spread itself thin trying to put every genre together.  There were quite a few funny parts though - one being a funny smurf conversation.<br />Sure, i understand what's going on.  But, you should rent this one first, cause it's not for everyone.  Along the same lines as this is muholland drive, which is far better.  Same with final destination.
B00007BH5C|4.0|I was surprised when Howard Shore's score for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; won the Oscar.  I am not saying that it wasn't deserving, but I didn't think it had much of a chance given the competition.  On &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; Shore's music has taken a turn for the somber.  This is not the same music from his first undertaking.  From the opening, &quot;Foundations of Stone,&quot; the CD begins with a very &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; tone with its choral section, more Wagner opera than John Williams.  It gives the impression that this installment in the trilogy is going to be rife with overwhelming odds, epic battles, and impending doom.  The score for the first film had a very bright disposition.  It allowed one to smell the fields of green grass and hear the rivers rolling over rocky beds near the Shire.  By the time you get to the beginning of &quot;The Riders of Rohan,&quot; you feel like heavy losses have already felt by the good guys at some epic battle; however, the brightest musical component of the score is the second half of &quot;Rohan:&quot; the introduction of a new theme.  The theme echoes of loss, but the potential for hope still lingers.  The strings (I think by a collection of fiddles) is simply beautiful and melodic, similar to the sad solo vocal at the end of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; on the first movie's score, indicating a painful moment of loss in the story.  Considering the CD begins with what sounds like a huge crash of steel and armor, it is little surprise that many of the pieces are dense, intense, and incremental in scope.  The moments of silence are oft abruptly broken by loud, crashing cymbals or powerful vocal accompaniment.  &quot;The Uruk-Hai&quot; alows the rich horn fanfare of the first movie's main theme to meet its sibling theme for &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; showing the definite kinship.  Every track has a pressing, onimous sadness, be it subtle like &quot;Evenstar&quot; or blatant as in the lamentable &quot;Gollum's Song.&quot;  I originally gave this 3 stars, but as I wrote, I realized that this is NOT worse than the first score.  It is just a lot darker, laden with images of rainy, muddy paths, looming threatening clouds, and the outbreak of grand war on the horizon.  The whole score swells with a sense of epic scale, full of horns and large string sections.  I think that this score is an excellent compliment to the first.  Playing the two side-by-side, you can actually feel yourself on the journey to destroy the Ring, inching closer to Mount Doom...and the darkness that awaits.
067101756X|5.0|I just finished reading the book and found it very interesting. Yes, he could have elaborated on several topics, but he is still a credible military officer. If you read the book for what it is you will get the understanding that it probably did happened. With his credentials and other details in the book it JUST MAKES SENSE! There is nothing in the book of technologies that don't exist today. It is understandable that a career military officer wouldn't publish CLASSIFIED material in a book. That just ads credibility to the book. Some of these posts were right on that fact...<br />Obviously some people didn't read the book before commenting. We were already looking at some of the technologies before Roswell, we just didn't know where to begin. The book says that Corso went out and found reputable scientists already working on the technologies (Night Vision, Integrated Circuits, Laser, et.) and \\"helped them along.\\" This makes total sense! Look at how far we have come in just 20 years! Add 10 years to that and you get the time it took for the military to refine it. Corso NEVER said that the \\"aliens\\" were sole proprietors of the above technologies. How else could we have advanced so fast in the past 30 years than the previous 100? Like I said, it just makes sense.<br />Here are some other facts:<br />1. Astronauts & pilots HAVE said they have seed alien spacecraft<BR>2. He NEVER said that the aliens were lying on the ground for 4 hours, and then ran off...besides he said he wasn't there! This book was written about the alien technologies he researched which we now see in everyday use, especially the military (10 years later)<br />Very good book!!! Read it and you be the judge!
B00005MCX3|5.0|Now THIS is good. Not only did Hawkwind still have Lemmy, but they went and got ex-High Tidesman Simon House and incorporated fiddle and Mellotron (YAY!) into their already voluminous wall of sound. The spacy whooshiness of DOREMI FASOL LATIDO morphed into a more 70s proggish atmosphere- -probably inevitible given the new instrumentation and Zeitgeist (heh heh)- -which served the band well. Some of the Hawkers' best material is here: Nik Turner's 'D-Rider', Lemmy's own pre-Motorhead 'Lost Johnny' and the stunning, live seven-minute hooter 'You'd Better Believe It', the title of which is probably good advice coming as it does from the ragged throat of Mr. Kilmister. The bonus tracks aren't absolutely essential (the mediocre live 'It's So Easy' was the B-Side to a tragically truncated 'You'd Better Believe It') but still nice to have around, and some of the tracks ('Psychedelic Warlords', 'Paradox') lumber on longer than they really need to. But the Hawkwind of the 70s never strived for economy anyway, and anything worth doing is worth over-doing, eh? Besides, the shorter instrumental tracks, especially House's title track, make up for it. Play this back-to-back (or side-by-side) with 1975's WARRIOR ON THE EDGE OF TIME and see what happens.
B00003CXXM|5.0|\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is by far the best action movie of 2002! It starts fast and never slows down, from beginning to end. Matt Damon (of \\"Good Will Hunting\\"/\\"Saving Private Ryan\\" fame) delivers a dynamite performance as Jason Bourne; a CIA operative whos failed assassination attempt of a world leader causes him to be put for extermination by his own company. Coming from near-death, without any remembrance of the past, Bourne embarks to find and retrace why he is in the situation, he is, while battling those that seek to end his life. All this with the skills and techniques that are provided to him by being a CIA Op. Franka Potente (lead of \\"Run Lola Run,\\" the best German film of the 90s: if you haven't seen it, check it out ASAP) is amazing as Bourne's penniless sidekick. She is smart, sexy, and a perfect compliment to Damon. They are an excellent pair together! This movie is amazing for its great dialogue, witty and charismatic cast, and non-stop action sequences. Chris Cooper is quite good as Bourne's former boss, who wants him dead ASAP. And, an upcoming star in Julia Stiles makes a brief appearance as a CIA employee. On top of the cast, the film is gifted with excellent cinematography. Set primarily in Paris, it has the ability to take that city that many Americans know well and transform it into an exotic masterpiece, ala Budapest or Prague. The camera angles of the scenes are fantastic, giving the audience plenty of excitement, as Bourne climbs down walls and beats his way through security officers. All in all, this is a movie that everyone will like. It is the action highlight of 2002, with maybe the best chase scene in the history of film (and that includes the 1971 classic: \\"The French Connection\\") And, what makes this movie so much better than let's say \\"XXX,\\" is that Damon is believable as the smart, witty Bourne and his action sequences are riddled in athletic ability, then an overdoing of special effects. This film is quite believable, which adds to its aura. Definitely check this movie out, by all means. Built on a strong novel, it's a smart film, with a great cast, beautiful cinematography, and nonstop action. The action of film of 2002: \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"
0064407667|5.0|Great, colorful writing that ends badly, badly, badly.<br />The author promises to provide a very sad tale with NO happy ending, and further tempts you to put the book down if you cannot deal with this.<br />This series is possibly geared more towards adults, but if you have a very hearty child, then he or she may be able to withstand this series.<br />Five stars--could hardly be better (except maybe for a happy ending once or twice).
B00003CXXJ|5.0|But, ....I laughed so hard I had to go buy the DVD!!  It is animated, but has the sutle humor needed to keep an adult entertained thoughout the show.  I was particularly impressed by the marvellous facial expressions captured by the creators.  The characters literally come to life on the screen!  It is romantic, addresses moral issues in a manner that are not offensive, and includes a number of warm, beautiful songs that enhance the overall experience of this viewing.  There is a second disc that has a number of entertaining features that might be attractive to children, but it is the wonderful movie presentation that justifies this purchase.  It is just GREAT!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|My first thought after seeing this film for the first time was, \\"What the ****?\\". It was like watching \\"Ordinary People\\" on drugs. I am sure I am not the only one that felt this way. After having co-workers recommend this movie to me a couple of times I decided to rent it. By reading the description I was expecting a horror movie or a slasher film. That is very far from the truth. I would almost call this a comedy. But it's not really that funny. It is a movie that does not fit into one category or even two for that matter.<br />The darkness of this movie and its lead character are overplayed at times. His psychological problems are not the first to be seen on the big screen. But his visions and hallucinations may be. The more scientific the movie gets the more it gets away from what I thought its intended purpose was. It seems by end of the movie you are forced to ask questions and there are some loose ends. <br />The soundtrack is fantastic. Every song rings true of the eighties and is selected for a reason. Every song played in the movie is perfectly placed. I do believe this film could take place at any time in the last 30 years but the eighties seem to work. But other than the soundtrack and 1988 references like Mike Dukakis and Joe Gibbs you wouldn't know when it was set.
B00004XPQ2|5.0|THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is one of my favorite war movies. It is a story about life in a World War II Japanese prison camp situated in a Burmese jungle. The screenplay is actually an adaptation from an anti-war novel by Pierre Brouille. The main thrust of the film is the duel of wills between the commanding officer (Sessue Hayakawa) of the camp and the commander (Alec Guinness) of the British prisoners.<br />The production is marked by strong acting performances by Guinness and Hayakawa. William Holden plays the part of an American escapee who leads a band of commandos back to blow up a bridge which is being constructed by the prisoners. Holden is his usual competent self. Jack Hawkins is another respected actor in the cast.<br />Sessue Hayakawa began making American films in 1914 but spent his World War II years in Japan. The movie's theme song whistled by the prisoners on the way to work on the bridge became a popular recording during the late 1950's.<br />THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI received several Academy Awards including best actor by Guinness. Hayakawa was also nominated for best supporting actor. Some other awards were for best picture, director, screenplay and cinematography.
067144901X|5.0|Great for little ones and fun for parents too. I always enjoy Sandra Boynton's children's books. Her writing is a joy to read out loud or make up a song and sing them. The cadence is wonderful fun. I highly recommend getting the music CD: Philadelphia Chickens by Sandra Boynton [[ASIN:B0001ADB6Y Philadelphia Chickens]] -- the whole family loves it.
079070546X|5.0|I cannot start the Christmas season without seeing this movie !  Clark Griswold hanging Christmas lights...can you picture it ?  This is the best Lampoon ever.  Even family who doesn't enjoy the Lampoon series really enjoyed this.  I recommed it highly !
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I will not give anything away, but this movie needs to be pieced together.  Each additional time you watch it you will see new things.<br />Great movie.  Very different, though, so some may not like (fans of action-only movies and movies that make you think).
0380789035|4.0|This book was interesting, especially if you are a little familiar with folklore or mythology.  The ending left me a little disappointed, but the getting there was great.
B00000I41G|5.0|You'll never go back to silly, boring, 3-chord blues after hearing what Kenny Burrell can do.  None of the songs here are really traditional blues at all, but there is a relaxed bluesy FEEL in these songs.  Burrell has the most incredible guitar tone and his note placement is perfect.  This music is both relaxed and low-key AND dramatic all at the same time.  Listen to Soul Lament and then Midnight Blue and you'll feel it too.  He's the best.
B000075BFK|5.0|I bought this album the on 26th in the morning when the stores opened. This album, what can I say, is a 2pac album. All the songs are excellent. I listen to it every day sometimes a few times a day. I've heard when we ride on our enemies maybe like 50 times already. Same goes for still ballin, ghetto star, etc. If you look for a bad song on this album, you won't find it, so keep looking.
B00007BH5C|3.0|Updated version of the LOTR soundtrack with some new sounds.  Being a fan of Kronos Quartet, CLint Mansell, and the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack, I was excited about the prospect of hearing The Summer Overture receive a full orchestra treatment (the music for the siege of Helm's Deep in the second trailer).  Unfortunately, they took the time to record it, but not add it to the soundtrack.  What a loss.
B000000OQF|5.0|guns n roses appetite for destruction is defnetly one of the best cds ever. The best three songs are welcome to the jungle,paradise city,and sweet child o mine. Other songs like Mr. brownstone are good too.This is the best 80's cd/album of all time. This is the best cd ever! So buy Guns n Roses appetite for destruction as soon as you can. You will not be dissapointed!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I thought this CD was amazing. Although some people portray her new image as being [trashy] due to the first release \\"Dirty\\", she is anything but. That song gives the wrong idea of what her album is about. Her album has many beautifully written tracks and her powerful voice just tops the cake. My favorite is \\"Walk Away\\". She really is in the league of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. I played that song for my mom and she thought it was Whitney Houston singing. All I have to say is buy this CD. I think Christina Aguilera deserves respect for finally showing us the true side of her and not the image that was created for her.
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all, I couldn't decide whether to give this movie four or five stars. As you can see, I chose five. I really like it alot, but it is definetly not even close to the original trilogy. However, Episode 2 is. I loved that one. Don't be put off by this one. See E. 2.
B00005JLRR|5.0|This is billed as being the final journey of the Next Generation crew, and it definitely IS the final journey for one of them.  Any time a major character dies, you have to wonder about how they're going to bring them back, but this character's death isn't a \\"Mr. Spock\\" kind of death...it's definitely a \\"Captain Kirk\\" dead-and-gone way to do it.  While I hate to see a character develop for 15 years and then be wiped clean in an instant, in this case the character's death makes sense, and they go out in the most heroic manner I've seen through any of the films or tv shows.  It's hard to believe the new crew is gone, but I guess the Paramount folks figured it was best to give these folks a rest and move on to their other two major ST franchises of Voyager and DS9.  Maybe for the next film we can see the remaining characters of all 3 series (Enterprise just doesn't count) get together to find Sisko or something.  Yes, this movie has it's cameos from Wesley Crusher (non-speaking, thank goodness) and Guinan too just for good measure.  And it's good to see Ryker finally taking a ship of his own (I didn't give anything away - that's revealed in the first 5 minutes of the movie).  The villian in this one is so subdued with that inner smoldering anger that he's almost comatose.  He definitely ain't no Khan, that's for sure.  I highly recommend this movie though and I eagerly await the next one in the series!  Way to go guys, and goodbye ______ (I'm not going to give it away).
B00005JLRR|5.0|I have just gotten back from the movie theater and I have to say I was completely blown away by Star Trek: Nemesis. Tom Hardy put in an astounding performance as Shinzon and the space battle between the Enterprise and Shinzon's ship was adrenaline-pumping to say the least. The suspence is great. There is plenty of action and the special effects do not dissapoint. There are also powerful emotions in the film which has not really been seen much since Star Trek: Generations. The death of Data was truly painful to watch much like Spock's death in Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan. Star Trek: Nemesis is a perfect Star Trek movie, has a brilliant ending, although sad, and bids a fond farewell to the crew of the Enterprise who we have enjoyed watching their journeys for 15 years.
B00006M183|5.0|This is, like every Pearl Jam album before, almost completely different from the previous albums.<br />It is probably most like a cross between Yield and Binaural.<br />The first time I listened to the album I wasn't overwhelmed, but, like all of their music, it grows on you (I didn't listen to Ten the whole way through until after Vs. was released...).<br />Love Boat Captain is probably the song I like the least that I could have liked a lot more.  I have the feeling that it is somewhat overdone.<br />Songs that stand out (to me at least) include : Green Disease, I Am Mine and Cropduster.  I think that Green Disease and Cropduster are two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs.  <br />The rest of the album is solid.  The feel of the album is more spontaneous than Binaural.  The vocals are nicely meshed with the rest of the music (unlike that mess of a recording 'Live on Two Legs'). <br />Basically, I'd say that if you like Yield, give this album a chance.  Listen to it through with headphones on a couple times.  Read along with the lyrics printed in the insert.  Use your imagination to see what the artist want you to see and feel. <br />I think that, if you have an open mind and if you give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.  Not everyone is going to like this album.  It is certainly not a 'Pop' record.  But, if you respect and enjoy the music that Pearl Jam has made, then buy this album.
B00000DHR0|1.0|I was fortunate to live a few years of my life without knowing about this CD.  Unfortunately, it has now been playing on a regular basis at work.  Every time it is played, I start bleeding from the ears and foaming at the mouth.<br />Each song carries multiple crescendoes and flourishes that somehow all sound alike.  Even with the occasional interlude in which she is not shouting at the top of her lungs like a hog-calling contest, I am gritting my teeth while awaiting the inevitable build-up and vocal display of power.<br />One more question...When did the &quot;s&quot; sound become &quot;sh&quot;?  I was jusht wondering becaush I don't remember.  But every shong dishplays thish feature.  It ish alsho notable on her other albumsh.
B000065U1N|4.0|That's right, tons of war violence(which is expected), and LOADS of f words. Otherwise a good flik.
B000002H97|3.0|Metallica's 1991 &quot;epic&quot; album, which in my opinion is so far overrated, the album rates nothing like the prior effort (1988's &quot;...and justice for all&quot;) the album's highlights would have to be unforgiven, nothing else matters, god that failed, my friend of misery, the struggle within, and holier than thou.  Other than that the songs are listenable but mediocre, although i do not assuage you from steering away from this album, it is a good album, but does not live up to what i expect.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie has tremendous impact.....spiritually, emotionally and portrays the wisdom of innocence. <BR>It's difficult to describe this masterpiece because it conveys so many simple, yet powerful messages....that it's best<BR>to watch it and feel it's beauty. Definitely in my Top 10 list of all time great movies! See it!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ahhh, John Mayer. I was introduced to him thanks to his infectious smash single 'No Such Thing', and later pulled in even further by his laid back second single 'Your Body Is A Wonderland'. With two such well crafted singer-songwriter pop songs, I had to get the album, there must be more, I thought.<BR>    I was correct in my assumption, and have been nothing short of dazzled with this record. Mayer is a very relatable writer, with his songs elaborating on subjects like romance and growing up. A comparison to Dave Matthews, in my opinion, is really far off. Mayer's voice has a very chilled quality which I enjoy listening to quite a bit, but Matthews tends to grate on me to no end.<BR>   The subject of vanishing youth is touched on with the lead single, 'No Such Thing', which talks of escaping the hold of high school and growing up and moving on to things like college and the real world. '83' is another cut, a nostalgic and wishing glance back at childhood and the more simple things.<BR>   Most of the other tracks are based in problems and longings that are parts of practically any relationship. Wanting love ('Love Song For No One', 'St. Patrick's Day'), having love ('City Love', 'Back To You'), enjoying love ('You Body Is A Wonderland', 'Great Indoors'), and the troubles of love ('My Stupid Mouth', 'Not Myself') are all touched on with effective and enjoyable tunes by this album.<BR>   One of the latter songs I mentioned is probably my favorite track from this great release, 'My Stupid Mouth'. It's the sort of song that could connect with anyone, especially with me, because I've experienced my own problems with &quot;my stupid mouth&quot; too.<BR>   A handful of other songs make their way onto this album too, a funkier sounding number called 'Neon' being one of those. All of these songs together are an incredibly coehesive work, and I'll be enjoying the music of one John Mayer for a long, long time to come. I'm truly anticipating another John Mayer album to come along someday soon too. I can't wait.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie is probably more famous for the controversy that unleashed that for its own artistic merits. Originally a project by the late Stanley Kubrick, it was passed to Steven Spielberg, who pretty much managed to pull off one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. However, he had to pay the price: being haunted by Kubrick's ghost.<br />A robotic version of \\"Pinochio\\", \\"AI\\" is not, however, your usual Spielberg flick. If you're looking for the emotional, tear-inducing ending that characterizes pretty much every movie that Steven has ever made, then this is not the right place. \\"AI\\" is a serious, deep, science fiction film that unravels the quest of a robot child called David, who is abandoned by the mother he was programmed to love. Influenced by Goldoni's tale, he begins a journey in search of the mythical Blue Fairy, the only one who can turn him into a human being. In the end, he will have to face the horror that comes along with the discovery of the soul, and the confrontation with the dilemma of an artificial being that was taught to be unique.<br />Filled with excellent performances and top-notch special effects, \\"AI\\" can satisfy both Spielberg and Kubrick fans alike (believe me, I am both). At almost 2 1/2 hours, it may seem a little bit long for impatient viewers, but it's worth it. This DVD edition is also it's natural home, with an excellent video transfer that gives the movie a crisp, detailed picture quality. The sound is also very good, with complete surround that gives an extra boost to one of John William's best scores so far! Thank God they didn't forget the Spanish subtitles this time! The second disc contains the special features, that include theatrical trailers, several mini-documentaries of the whole acting, directing, scoring and designing process, bios and filmographies and many sketckes and storyboards. The only thing missing, though, is an audio commentary. Too bad.<br />Anyway, forget about controversies and see for yourself. This movie was unfairly ignored by the critics and the box office, but it deserves being checked out. Personally, I love it, and I'm sure that you'll see the real deal about it too.ovie was unfairly ignored by the critics and the box office, but it deserves being checked out.

B00006BTCA|5.0|I can't say that I agree with most of the reviews I've read that compare them to Joy Division, Echo & the Bunnymen or the Furs.  Their sound is much too rich.  These guys are pure Kitchens of Distinction with a bit of Ride or even early Catherine Wheel thrown in.  No surprise that they're already a big name in the UK.  I'm amazed at how  strong their sound is.  You can't listen to this CD with the volume low.  Crank it up and let each song build a tidal wave that leaves you gasping for air.  I love how the vocals struggle to stay afloat in the swirling sea of rhythm guitars and crashing drums.  This is moody, cinematic and even ethereal music...but it truly rocks!

B00007E8V4|4.0|Firstly, you will meet few people in a lifetime more a System fan than myself, however I like them more now after this new album.  It seems from reading these reviews, I am pretty rare 'cause everyone listens to Slipknot, Metallica, Disturbed and whatnot and you can like whatever but I rarely listen to hard music... my favorite bands are the Beatles, Pink Floyd, DMB, Nick Drake (quiet accoustic and awesome), and Ben Harper (Burn one Down :).  I just love original deep amazing revolutionary music and no matter who you like, System of a Down can be for you.  No offense but I can't stand Slipknot and many others like them (went to Pledge of Allegiance tour and we left after system's set, skipping the traffic, the slipknot and crazy masks).  But that doesn't matter, because System is so original and powerful that it can be looked at as simply amazing music and not just something to bang your head to.  The first album was like a revolution, constantly climaxing and rolling along, the second an interlude (replacing some of the quiet-to-madness songs of the first album with all out madness that sounds and feels hollow and empty, like head-banging music (save Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials).  This third album clearly shows that the interlude is over and we're all in for some more beautiful psychotic brilliance.  If you havent heard the first album, get that.  If you have then this is the one to go with... 8.5/10
B000002Q7Y|5.0|Kansas has played a major role in the formation of my overall view of reality throughout my years. They are a solid group of musicians with a determination to express an inner truth through their music. If you bought this album expecting 'Song for America' or 'Point of Know Return', you may be in for some surprises. Steve Walsh's voice has never sounded more forceful,dramatic and focused: listen to the driving rhythm and punch of 'Silhouettes in Disguise' and then ease into the mellow and flowing sounds of 'All I Wanted'. There is a cohesiveness and mystery about this album that sets it apart from others of that day. With the addition of the always energetic Steve Morse on guitar, you also receive a dose of guitar-works that cannot be duplicated by any other player. 'Tomb 19' and 'Three Pretenders' are shining examples of this. I also found myself in total agreement with another reviewer who couldn't say enough about the ballad 'Can't Cry Anymore'. (By the way, there aren't too many songs out there today that can bring a tear to the eyes<BR>like this one can.) This album proved to be a transitional and challenging time for Kansas as their musical direction shifted towards modern times and at the same time, remained rooted in their past. Don't let other negative reviews turn you away from this album..Kansas adapted to the changes in the 80's and will continue to do so in the millenium..
B000005RTG|5.0|In no way am I disrespecting Ritchie Blackmore but, Tommy Bolan is just a better guitar player to me.

0385508417|1.0|Did John Grisham really write this piece of ill-conceived, unrealistic, cheesy, made-for-the-WB nonsense? I had to double-check the jacket to make sure. This is not only completely unlike John Grisham, it's completely unlike anything fit to publish. It amazes me how anyone can possibly rate this trite drivel as \\"the best Christmas story ever\\", or \\"utterly hilarious.\\" One other reviewer commented on how true-to-life this book is. What world is THAT guy living in? This warm and fuzzy yuppie community *might* have existed in some vaguely similar form in a 1920's rural town, but not in the present. And the utterly inane deus ex machina ending only serves to drive home the point that the story had no direction in the first place.<br />The concept is inspired and creative, but falls by the wayside to instead reinforce a standard and fluffy peace-on-earth-good-will-towards-men moral by the end. The idea of skipping out on Christmas is not really that weird, and the fact that an entire community would arise in an outraged uproar over one family's choice to forgo the celebration is so absurd it borders on lunacy. Add to that the fact that the two main characters are one-dimensional and completely undeveloped, and all the supporting cast members serve absolutely no purpose other than for scorn and ridicule, and you have a story that could literally make you angry while reading it. Where to start? Luther's change of heart in the last chapter doesn't make sense (Counting his blessings? WHAT blessings? All your neighbors ridicule you because you don't do what they do!). Nora's completely ... behavior throughout the story doesn't make sense (not to mention the fact that she turns on her husband in literally one second and is suddenly just as bad as the rest of the cruel neighbors). Not even their daughter falling in love with a Peruvian doctor in one week makes sense. First of all, in this day and age, the community's response wouldn't happen as it does in the book. Why? Because, honestly, NO ONE CARES THAT MUCH about other people's personal business. Half my neighborhood could skip out on the holiday and I would never even know, let alone care. Other people's business is other people's business; it's ridiculous to think that an entire community could exist anywhere in the universe where every single man, woman, and child becomes enraged because one man decides not to decorate his chimney with a huge plastic snowman.<br />What's truly odd is that other characters who are mentioned in passing have what would be considered unconventional plans for the holiday, yet no one seems to care about THEM. Luther's travel agent who books the cruise for him leaves for a resort in Mexico on Christmas Eve. Luther's next-door neighbors skip Christmas Day altogether to head up to a ski lodge for a week. Does anyone care that those people aren't sitting in their homes on Christmas day unwrapping Hallmark commercialism to \\"celebrate\\" the birth of the savior of the human race? Nope. This short story spanks the reader with the disgusting notion that your friends will turn against you, your wife will turn against you, the world will turn against you, if you don't conform to the masses. I couldn't finish this book fast enough, and you'd be well-advised to avoid it altogether.<br />It took me two days of off and on reading to finish this book. I think it must have been written in a quarter of that time. It's appalling that John Grisham, an excellent author, could have penned this nonsense. It's even more appalling that so many people think it's a beautiful story. It just goes to show you that a celebrity could poop in a bag, call it gold, and sell it for a million dollars. Don't be fooled by the name on the book: this isn't John Grisham in any form that is fit to read or fit to have his name affixed to. \\"A Painted House\\" proved Grisham could write good fiction that isn't law-related. \\"Skipping Christmas\\" does a 360-degree turn and proves that Grisham CAN'T write fiction that isn't law-related. But even the writing style itself is trite and simplistic. It isn't enough that the plot and characters are absurd, they're not even well-written! If the book hadn't been so short, there is absolutely no way I would have read the entire thing. It really, truly is horrible.<br />If this type of writing is the future of Grisham's career, maybe he should consider skipping novels and write scripts for \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and \\"Gilmore Girls\\" instead. You can't get much more unrealistic and inane than that.iction that isn't law-related. But even the writing style itself is trite and simplistic.

B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane...words do not do him justice. Some come to mind - fire, intensity, dizzying virtuosity, unbridled emotion. Anyone even sligthly into Jazz must listen to this. Trane defied logic, defied any conceivable limit. Sometimes you wonder if a human being is actually able to put forth so much energy without collapsing to the ground. He was superhuman. But, to top it all off, his compositions are very interesting. The accompanists are all top-notch, although the drums seem sometimes a bit more calm than they could be, to match Trane's tornado-like excursions. Elvin Jones and Roy Haynes  were a better match for Trane. But, that is just a minor gripe. This album is a classic, a masterpiece that hundreds of years from now we will still marvel at.
B00006LLNU|5.0|A lot of critics wrote something unfavorable of (), comparing it to \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\", and I suspect it's because these selfsame critics seem to regard bands as specimens to do dissections on: the evolution of such a band, the maturation and growth, etc... God knows we got enough Darwinian evolutionary vocabulary from school - we don't need to hear that trash when it's about the music we care for. And if there ever is a band who can care less about such things, it's Sigur Ros. The soundscape of this album is remarkable, and at times, more plaintive and emotional than \\"Agaetis\\". The build-up to tracks 7 and 8 is stirring and immaculate, and Sigur Ros with () is as preoccupied with beauties of innocence and its accompanying aches as ever before. A great release.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite CD of all time-- a lot more upbeat than the last Coldplay-- My personal pick is track #4- &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Green Eyes&quot;-- great vocals, great piano, great acoustics-- overall a great CD
0375703764|1.0|Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that this is a piece of entertaining literature.  It was tedious reading, and after finishing it I realized to my dismay that I had wasted hours of my life which I will never be able to regain.  Read it and weep, or pass on this book and spend your time on novels which are actually enjoyable.
6302794331|5.0|This is a movie for kids, so if you're an adult and didn't like it, duh!  I actually collect all the different versions of this Dickens classic on video and try to watch all of them every holiday season.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Henson people were actually able to stay as close to the text as they did.  Michael Caine is a scary Scrooge and the kids are afraid of him -- as is Kermit I might add, but remind the kids that at the end, Scrooge is a really nice guy who saves Tiny Tim, and they might come out from behind the couch to watch the last act.
B000002BBY|4.0|to me; oasis is the best band to come out of england since The Sex Pistols; they play real classic sounding rock 'n' roll and make it seem fresh. '(What's The Story) Morning Glory?' is by far the best album of their career; and one of the best albums to come out in 1995. this is the album that saved rock'n'roll and put it back onto the charts. the songwriting on this album is phenominal. Noel Gallagher is so overlooked by songwriting standards and being one of the best songwriters of the past decade. excerpts like: 'where were you when we were getting high' and 'please don't put your life in the hands of a rock 'n' roll band; who'll throw it all away' have a quality to them and become more timeless as the years go by. it is my belief that '(What's The Story) Morning Glory' will be remembered in the same way that 'Revolver' and 'Exile On Main Street' are remembered today. this album is a classic.
B00005J6RE|3.0|Not the very best episodes among the original series offerings; they're weighed down a bit by, respectively, too much heavy allegory (&quot;The Omega Glory&quot;) and excess preachiness (&quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;). Both episodes, however, showcase some good character moments and humor.  And, like all the original series Treks on DVD, the picture is sharp and clean.  One could do worse.
1577311523|5.0|For those of us who shy away from anything that sounds as newagie as \\"The Power of Now\\", Tolle's theory (or perhaps his explication of Buddhism) is exceptionally rational.  There has to have a been a period of time before we ever had our first thought, before we were able to accumulate the surplus of background noise and static, and before we were able to berate ourselves about the past and project ourselves into the future.  An ingredient in thought is `consciousness' but (with meditation as a sort of proof) consciousness does not supervene on thought.  What came first - the chicken or the egg?  In this case we have an answer.  There must have been a time where consciousness preceded thought in order for thought to have occurred at all.  Therefore it is possible for us to exist separate from our thinking minds, due to the fact that we were in fact once separate from our thinking minds.

0316096199|5.0|One would think, that following the sheer violent impact of the rape that the author experienced, anything else would be less-than-compelling.  Quite the contrary.  The disturbing effects of the rape don't stop with the night in question, but continue with the assortment of family, friends and strangers Alice deals with following the rape.  Those who are supportive are not always loved ones, and those who add to the trauma of the initial experience are not always strangers.  <br />All in all, this book is a masterpiece for anyone who might want to know what sort of range of emotion a victim of violent crime might experience.  I found myself angry at various people as the events unfolded in the book, and amazed at Alice's fortitude.  Her intelligence, insight and wit, throughout the experiences of the rape, the investigation and the trial of her rapist, are impressive.  <br />Alice is able to look at her case impassively enough to see that she had many things going for her in achieving a conviction; Things that were a matter of chance, as it happens, but which allowed her to see it through in a way that someone of different circumstances might not have.  <br />She amazingly, is able to portray herself, subtly, as \\"lucky\\" - lucky to be bright, well-spoken; <BR>lucky to have been wearing concealing rather than revealing clothes on the night of the rape; <BR>lucky to have had no sexual history to hold against her; <BR>lucky to be alive.  <br />Any woman (hopefully any person) reading the book, should be simulaneously convinced of her \\"lucky\\" status, and of the irony of the situation and the use of the word \\"lucky\\". She is a hero, not a survivor.  <br />My use of her first name is in no way intended as disrespect, but as an indication that it is difficult to read so much of the inside of another person's head, without feeling that we're on a first-name basis.  <br />Within a year or so after the initial crime, a close friend of Alice's is subjected to a similar violent act, and deals with it very differently.  This, too, is disturbing, in its avoidance of what happened... interesting.  <br />I hope that many people read this book and feel LUCKY after reading it.  I did.

B00006F7S4|5.0|There is no other artist in the public eye who has continued to be as ingenious and wonderfully surprising as Beck.  He seems to feel no need to stick to one particular sound, but rather allows himself to explore musically.  With Sea Change he has achieved one of his greatest successes.  Beck doesn't pull any punches with this album, but seems to be wearing his heart on his sleeve, so to speak and it is truly touching.  He is much less guarded than on past albums.  I think some fans of Beck's biggest hits may be a bit alienated by it, but for his dedicated fans and perhaps for a whole new audience, this record is a gem.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold begins a disturbing story, continues it with realism and innocence, adds a little humor some rather strange fantasy, and wraps up with a slightly cynical fate for the villain.  The story manages to combine realistic detail with a lot of imagination. The engrossing tale follows various survivors -- the victim's sister, father, friends through their travails over her death.  The victim herself watches from any chosen viewpoint, as an omniscent narrator.  The story is a little rambling with so many characters' feelings to follow, but still easy to read.  Finally, the ending is not entirely satisfying, but is probably more realistic for it, as the perpetrator goes on to kill again before his ultimate demise.  Is it at the hand of a victim?  You decide.
0812550706|5.0|I found the story of Ender's Game to be an exciting adventure in the future, where Earth is threatened by aliens called Buggers. I absolutely loved this book from cover to cover, not just because it is my favorite genre of literature, but because it had the important messages of life: love, excitement, bravery and danger. I would recommend this novel to anyone who wants to experience a story that you just can not stop reading... and trust me, you won't want to! The only problem is that the main characters are sometimes slightly unbelievable, partly because they are all children who don't act or talk like children. The justification for this is that they are supposed to be geniuses, and the author attempts and usually succeeds in tracing their development from young children to adolescence when they all become famous heroes who save the Earth.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams seems to be an ascending star in the music biz.  Ultra-prolific, he cranks out good and sometimes great songs at a headspinning rate and seems to appear everywhere.<br />Gold, his second solo album after the breakup of his first band, Y'all-ternative rockers Whiskeytown finds Ryan in fine form.  Moving away from his countryish roots toward more of a seventies style southern rock sound, Gold is as solid an album as any released in 2001.  The first seven songs on the disk are anywhere from excellent to &quot;merely&quot; solid. Well written, sung and performed in a number of styles, they give the impression of a classic album in the making.<br />Then trouble sets in.<br />The three songs in the middle of the record, Nobody Girl, Sylvia Plath and Enemy Fire are the weakest tracks here.  Though not unlistanable, the destroy the momentum of the disk.  Nobody Girl is an overly long guitar workout which does not deliver as the centerpiece of the album.  Sylvia Plath is just plain dull and misguided and Enemy Fire probably sounded good in rehersal, but goes nowhere once captured on tape.<br />The good news is that with the next track (Gonna Make You Love Me) through the end the quality makes a nice rebound, though not quite to the level of excellence of the opening tracks.  A testimony to the artist's talent is that though there is nothing here that is new lyrically or sonically, this is still a fresh sounding album.<br />I get the feeling that Ryan Adams has the tools to create a classic album somewhere in his future.  Gold is not that album, but is still worthy of your investigation.
B00007E8WL|5.0|no matter what you say you couldn't denie 2pac as the greatest rapper of all times even beyond the grave which is displayed when you hear his new cd. He pours out his heart on every song and thugz mansion(not the acoustic featuring Nas)to me can be spoken in the same sentence as the greatest rap songs if not all forms of music in my eyes.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Yes, it's true that you can make a good case for there being some horrible omissions here. \\"Please Please Me\\" is definitely better than \\"Love Me Do,\\" which is one of my least favorite Beatles songs, and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is a masterpiece. This doesn't even take into account the huge numbers of album tracks that are easily among the greatest Beatles songs ever - \\"In My Life,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" \\"A Day In The Life,\\" and scores of others. There are huge numbers of songs that could be on any disc like this.<br />However, \\"#1\\" still serves as an outstanding introductory disc to the Beatles. Before this, there was no simple way to get involved in their rich catalog. There are probably about seven studio albums that could be contenders for the title of \\"best Beatles album\\" and the \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" albums are incredibly expensive. This is a great introductory disc for anybody interested or anybody looking to get into the greatest band ever.<br />Also, even with the omissions, there's really no way to complain about the content here - it's 27 great singles compiled in chronological order. On a purely song-by-song basis, then, this must be given five solid stars. And as an introductory disc, it does a great job. Just remember that this means you need to track down everything else, too...
B00006RCNW|5.0|I would give this program 10 stars if I could. I saw the previews before the first season started, but was not able to see the first few episodes so I did not watch any of them. I have this thing about watching episodes in order so I waited. Then they played each episode one day after another. Truely the most perfect casting. I loved The Commish and I cannot believe it is the same person. I was praying that it would be available on DVD soon and it will be. I was told by someone that it was too violent. Fighting drugs and crime cannot be dealt with any other way. this is not customer service where you have to wear a constant smile to prevent insulting someone killing people and selling dope. There is a big difference in a personal drug user and a dealer. If letting a personal user slide (within logical reason) to catch the ones dealing to kids and gangs, then it must be allowed. It is no different than every day life elsewhere. Just in a different form. If I was a cop and someone pulled out a carton of smokes, I would not hesitate to shoot. No time to say \\"you got me. Nice joke\\" Cops do not make that much money, but have to worry about how they defend themselves. If I pulled out a carton like a weapon, I would expect to get shot. Who wants to die for a criminal's rights over their own. This show will grow to be quite a great thing. I know someone that is a drug user and hates the show and it is because it does not promote drugs. So if it scares people that are trouble, then the show really works. People worry about cigarettes killing people. I worry more of someone on coke with a gun. Season two will be awesome I am sure!!!11
B00003CXI1|1.0|Well, I just keep thinking what makes a person give a junk like this a 5-star-rating?!?!? Is It all the flufies out there baring the name of the characters? Or the big merchandising machine in which this movie was really made for?? Have people really got into It?? well, with so many reality show programs catering into public taste, I don't doubt It. as a matter of fact, when I went to the movie theaters to see this one, I thought,''Hey, GREAT, I'll finally see some magic moments'', then, I was thinking of THE LEGEND, NEVER ENDING STORY, even LABIRYNTH, which are kid's stuff but pretty magical, after watching the first half of the movie, I just..... Dozed off and then slept. It bored me out of my skull and I couldn't recommend It to anyone who still has some brains. The acting is pitifull, the story is cliche and the only moment which I really enjoyed was when the great horned owls arrived at his door to deliver the mail. Let's all be honest here, first of all, what makes a movie a great movie? When It touches you somehow, right? Well, did at any moment Harry Potter touch you people? Did you feel like crying? Did you feel emotionally drained after watching It? Did you sense any....Magic? I don't think so, now, just a reminder of a great movie is, remember E.T? Hummmm, I cried rivers! Alladin? The Beauty &amp; The Beast? Even Indiana Jones! Well, but that's just a thought.
6304082428|4.0|An annoying mother, amusing father and their five daughters star in this role as the family of choice. Mrs. Bennet is determined to find the richest young men possible for her children, so when Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy step into the country, the family is in uproar. This movie is filled with wit and couples. Many obstacles block the road to true love and it is enjoyable to watch them overcome each barrier. A wonderful show if you don't mind annoying mothers. Read the book for the whole story!
B00005JLRR|4.0|Sometimes I just don't think critics see the same films as I do. If you like Star Trek AT ALL you will be thoroughly entertained by this film. Being a Trek fan I can't comment about how this movie will be<BR>received by the mainstream. I don't have  a perspective on that. I felt that the plot, the acting and the special FX were all very well done. The only possible negative for me is that there were some similiar plot devices as STII \\"The Wrath  Of Khan\\". Of course there have been so many stories told it's difficult to create situations of danger that do not have some duplication. I stayed away from spoilers and was surprised at the end. Very emotional family feeling to it. If you have watched and become familiar with the characters and their relationships over the years there is no way you will not be emotionally affected by the end of this adventure. I wish it were longer. -Kevon
B000002LCI|4.0|The ironic title says it all \\"Music for the Masses\\" was meant as a tongue in cheek statement but turned out to be more prollific than was intended.<BR>A great album by any standards with standout single tracks including \\"Strange Love\\",(the album version is different to the single release)these are interwoven masterfully with a unique, textured backdrop of sound and emotion a la Martin.<BR>The first Mode Album to introduce guitar in a major way. This is not used in a conventional fashion but more in order to enrich the songs. Developing and growing new sounds has always been a DM staple and is used to great effect on this album. Never to outdo the song but rather to enhance it as illustrated brilliantly on \\"I want you now\\" yes yes yes!!! Martins Voice is full of emotion in this ballad (he sings 2 on the Album)<BR>Probably there best offering for new fans next to \\"Violator\\"as it shows a maturity and newness while offering commercial appeal. The tempo of MFTM is varied and never dull it takes you on a journey in a style similar to that of a \\"concept album\\"without being trite or pretentious. Sit back and enjoy.

B00006C79E|4.0|Almost four stars would be a more accurate grade.<br />Every Saint Etienne CD has a different feel and this one is no exception. It took about a week to get hooked; now it's always in or near the stereo. It's no \\"So Tough,\\" but it's in the same neighborhood as \\"Sound of Water\\" and \\"Good Humour\\" -- poppier than the former, less so than the latter. <BR>There are still some songs I can't get into: \\"Amateur\\" is nerve wracking and the \\"Soft Like Me\\" rap isn't even enjoyable in an ironic way. However, \\"Action\\" is an immediately catchy single and \\"The Way We Live,\\" \\"Stop and Think,\\" and \\"Finisterre\\" are welcome additions to the canon.
0060523794|1.0|I have not and will not buy this book.  Gerstner's approach was pure abuse, such as the way some animal trainers get wild animals to perform.  Gerstner was able to rid IBM of company loyalty, sacrifice investment in future products for immediate profitability, and bloat the salaries of a select few while making &quot;the most important resource&quot; totaly expendable.  He is a perfect example of the greedy CEO's who only understand how to pad their personal assets at the sacrifice of the corporation and its employees.
B00005JKNF|1.0|This movie was interesting from the trailers when advertised. I love a good murder mystery, however this was not one. It dwelt more on the upstairs/downstairs way of British life instead of the murder. The murder didnt even occur until more than halfway through the movie which made for a slowgoing plotline. I was very bored with it and except for a very select few good one liners this was a huge disappointment for me. It's only for those who enjoy reliving the British way of life back in the 20's & 30's, which I find quite boring.

WOW!<br />I say Bravo! to John Logan for this terrific story. If you've liked First Contact, this one is better. Don't wait, go and see it!
0062502182|5.0|I really thought this book was amazing. I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I was so captivated from the begining, that i could hardly put it down.  It really has a great philosophy that makes you think.  I definitely recommend this for any reader!!
6304698658|2.0|Make no mistake, the movie is great and is a classic. Very funny, one of the great classics. But the DVD is another story. I would be embarrassed if I was Warner Bros for releasing a DVD like this one. No extras, picture and sound are fair, nothing you would expect for a DVD. No widescreen, just like a vhs tape. But it is a great movie to own, and rather own the DVD than the VHS.
B00007BH5C|3.0|The soundtrack probably works well with the movie but it is pretty bland otherwise. The only thing I really liked was \\"Evenstar (feat. Isabel Bayrakdarian)\\" which sounded fantastic. The track really brought Tolkien's world to life and captured the essence of Tolkien's story about the Elfs (\\"Fighting the long defeat\\") and Arwen Evenstar (Lúthien). Anyway, I should probably warn you about \\"Gollum's Song (performed by Emiliana Torrini)\\" which I absolutley hated. I kept thinking about James Bond music while litening to it. WT*Beep*! The rest of the soundtrack while not bad just bored me. Been there done that, yawn. <br />Btw, the trailer featured a butchered version of Clint Mansell's Requiem For a Dream score for some reason.
0321127420|5.0|This is the best book I've found on J2EE and .Net patterns.  I think it's destined to become a classic.  I found the discussions on when to distrbute ('sell your favorite grandmother first'), Unit Of Work, Domain Model and Data Mapper patterns extremely useful.  It has changed the way I think about enterprise applications.  <br />I think it fits somewhere between the original 'Design Patterns' book, by Gamma, et al, and a book like 'J2EE Patterns' in terms of its scope.  'Design Patterns' describes existing patterns that are applicable to any kind of application.  'J2EE Patterns' describes patterns in terms of one platform (although many of them apply to other platforms as well.)   Fowler's book describes a set of patterns that work with a certain kind of application, business apps, but that are applicable to more than one platform.<br />It's better than the 'J2EE Patterns' book, which doesn't do a good job explaining which parts of J2EE to avoid, and which 'patterns' are in fact workarounds for problems in the platform itself.  (For example, the 'Composite Entity' pattern.) <br />I have to strongly disagree with the first reviewer.  Fowler does explain which patterns work best on which platform.  The first section of the book gives a good road map for deciding which set of patterns to use for your app.  He mentions explicitly that .Net pulls you in the direction of Table Module, but that with J2EE you would be less likely to use that pattern.  <br />As far as the patterns being available in frameworks, I still find it useful to know about the patterns the framework implements.  That way you know which framework to select.  We recently went through an O/R mapping tool selection process.  Reading the Unit Of Work, Data Mapper, Repository, Lazy Load and Identity Map chapters helped *immensely* in that process.  Likewise reading the Front Controller pattern gave me some new ideas on how best to utilize the Struts framework.  I totally disagree with the notion that &quot;learning about the patterns that are associated with these frameworks will provide little value&quot;.  Ignorance is definitely not bliss here.<br />Finally, the idea that because the book 'just' collects and names patterns that already exist somehow decreases its value is hogwash.  These are tried and true patterns that many developers have found useful.  Naming and clearly describing common patterns is very helpful.  This is exactly what the original 'Design Patterns' book did.  By this logic, I guess the original reviewer would have given 'Design Patterns' only 3 stars. <br />It's a great book.
B00006690G|5.0|I wasn't so sure about M&M (let's spell it right, folks) before this.  After all, I was dating Kim for a while (best I ever had) so he doesn't really like me.  But now that he's in a relationship with Elton John, it's all good, y'all!<br />The music is cleaver in the Vanilla Ice/Snow vein.  Who else could rip on Moby's age and be only 6 years younger than Moby?  It's also a shame that he thinks he's really Halley's poppa, but this kind of irony is exactly what makes this album so great.<br />All in all, I got real respect for Marshall now.  Please note that he no longer rips on gays.  Things must be real sweet with him and Elton.  Oh, by the way--Halley baby, if you're reading this, daddy's coming for ya.

B000075BFK|3.0|Lyrically this album is up there with Tupac's best work.  You can definetely hear the maturity in his words as most of the tracks were done towards the end of his days.  However, the production on this album is absolutely horrible.  With the exception of a couple tracks, this sounds like something Puffy would put out.  Tupac would never approve of these tracks, half of them sound the same.  They do not have the rawness that Tupac fans are used to.  I love Tupac and would think this album would be a 5 had it had some better production.  Hopefully Death Row and Amaru will correct this on the next album due out next year.

It is a far cry from the rest of the bad pop that layers track upon track of screaming through the airways. A refreshing change.  This guys's got a future.
B0000640SA|4.0|This is one of the best movies of its year.  I don't know what year it was made so I can't say best of ex. 2000 though that may be the year.  I heard ever since he was young, Nolan, the director wanted to make movies backwards.  This movie was really good.  It's probably the only movie that would ever work better backwards than forwards, and it has one of the ten most shocking endings in the last decade.  Joe Pantoliano, (from the Sopranos) and Guy Pierce umm... (Memento) light up the screen, while Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) better than a girl, though one seen of her's is scary.  In summation, probably the best cast for the movie.  If you're watching the DVD, make sure you don't choose to watch it in forward motion.  It will ruin the experrience.
B000002P5W|5.0|Like all the greats, Jimi Hendrix always continued to improve with each consecutive outing.  Although it is often overshadowed by the Experiences hit packed debut CD, Axis: Bold as Love signified a dramatic growth in the band all around that ultimately results in a more concise and mature message.  While still staying within the confines of 60s radio, a total of only three tracks crack the 3 minute barrier, Axiss songs are all well within the short, pop spectrum of Are You Experienced but theyve expanded exponentially in content as compensation for what they lack in length.  The talents of Hendrixs backing band are also noticeably more developed and allow the group to gel and flow so perfectly it sends shivers down ones spine.  Mitch Mitchells propulsive, complex rhythms should instantly guarantee him a spot as one of rocks greatest drummers and Noel Reddings bass runs sound cleaner and more natural than ever.  The member of the Experience who has developed the most though in the brief time between Are You Experienced and Axis is the legendary guitarist himself.  Instead of flaming out with one passion filled album, Hendrix proved to all of his critics that he was so much more than the flashy stomp rocker sometimes illustrated on songs like Foxy Lady.  Not only do his inarguably god-like guitar skills improve by leaps and bounds seemingly every time he plugs into his amp, but Jimi Hendrixs talents as a songwriter emerge on Axis as something intensely profound.  Songs like the brilliant anti-corporate If 6 was 9 and the sleek, jazzy Up From the Skies show that he has come a long way from his days of power chords and playing with his teeth.  Jimis sense of diversity remains intact as well with a song like Aint No Telling sitting next to Little Wing fusing together to create an album that is as beautiful and calm as it is flowing with pure adrenaline.  The biggest difference between the wide range of styles encompassed by Are You Experienced and Axis however is that while Experienced simply sounded like a set of wildly different songs, Axis: Bold as Love manages to seamlessly fit together using each unique element to build something much grander than the individual songs themselves.  Even though The Experiences work up to this point had been nothing short of awe inspiring, Axis: Bold as Love was that extra step that pushed Jimi Hendrix and his associates from being simply amazing to being legendary.  All three of the original Hendrix studio albums are a must for any sort of comprehensive CD collection and like the rest of Jimis work, Axis pushed the boundaries of music itself to achieve a sound that completely exceeded all prior accomplishments in the world of rock.
B00006J3T4|4.0|I was turned onto Knopfler by my guitar teacher who spoke very highly of his playing abilities. The Ragpeiker's Dream is my first Knopfler solo album and I am very impressed. It is a little on the folksy side, though not as much as Golden Heart. Knopfler has a very soothing voice and is excellent at using his guitar to add depth to his singing. I love the CD and the first four tracks are phenomenal. However, I find myself waiting to hear a classic Knopfler/Dire Straits electric guitar solo which really doesn't happen. So, don't give away your Brothers In Arms album, this isn't the same. If you are already a Knopfler solo fan, this is probably what you expected. Others will be pleasantly surprised.
B000068OCS|5.0|Even after reading the reviews I couldn't believe it that a current motion picture edition rerelease would again crop koyaanis so I signed up and sprung for a dvd copy. In '84 I skipped outta work early, shh..., to hit the art cinema at pearl st. boulder to see it. Ever since then I have called sony electronics \\"ony's\\" because of a logo scene later in the film. Now it appears the new nick name is \\"uny's\\". hmmm...  Can't say I'll adopt that one.  Oh well the dvd version is still stunning even though many scenes feel compacted because the cropping has removed some of the space around the scene as originally intended. My best guess, the original film with its theatre aspect ratio and stuning glory was only released for the formated to fit your screen. So the sides were cropped for cable. Then that format was only released which has been compressed vertically to regain to the original aspect ratio of the theatre presentation for display on the 16:9 tv's. Wish I could walk back into that art cinema and see the film again but today it is a clothing store. The other thing I have noticed is KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI won't play on my old pc's dvd but BARAKA does.
B000069AUI|4.0|I was very very hesitant about ever hearing this album, much less ever having the album in my CD collection since I didn't like Parachutes at all and I really really disliked the song \\"Yellow\\" in particular but after some goading, I finally got this CD.  I am presently surprised, with this being a sophomore release and coming from a band I didn't like before, to find this album is extremely unique on many areas and a very good release this year.  The album opens with \\"Politik\\" with a sound at first I wasn't crazy about but after a few listens, it's not too bad at all and lyrically this song is really interesting along with the piano accompaniment.  \\"In My Place\\", the single off the album, reminds me of REM and Oasis mixed together but this song isn't too bad lyrically at all either.  \\"God Put a Smile On Your Face\\"...this is one of my very favorite songs on the album (even though the guitar rift throughout the song and also the presentation of the song overall sounds like a more acoustic and lyrical version of Saliva's \\"Greater/Less Than\\" off of Every Six Seconds) with good lyrics and I like this formula in a song.  \\"The Scientist\\" is very good with the piano opening and vocals and I love the lyrics of this song too..another good pick. \\"Clocks\\" is my favorite song on the entire album because it's not like anything I've ever heard before musically and lyrically it's extremely interesting with soaring vocals.  \\"Daylight\\" is probably one of my least favorite tracks on the album and seems almost too pop for my tastes in rock.  \\"Green Eyes\\" has a nice rhythm to it and great lyrics too, praising someone for being so good and a close friend and rock.  \\"Warning Sign\\" is actually an amazing song about missing someone and it's something that many many people can relate to and the string and piano combination is phenominal..another fav track.  \\"A Whisper\\" is my least favorite track on the entire album because it's starts out too much like a track by The Strokes and it just getson my nerve throughout the entire thing.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is a good track with pretty good lyrics but sounds almost too much like some of the earlier tracks.  \\"Amsterdam\\" ends off the album with a melancholy tone accompanied with piano (reminders of the ending scenes of Cruel Intentions) and absolutely amazing lyrics so deep and so probing...it's sort of a sad song to end the album on but the end of the song revives into a rock edge that makes this end off strong and passionately through and through.  This album was a pleasant surprise thanks to the persistence of a friend and keeps growing on me after each listen, as a truly good album should do.
0618164413|3.0|Growing up in the 1960's, \\"Curious George\\" was \\"required reading\\" for American children, at least in the Northeast, and the original stories gathered in this volume still stand as all-time favorites in American children's literature. Our little ones love these stories the most, just like all the reviewers here say. And this is a beautifully presented collection, including the informative background info on the authors, H.A. & Margret Rey, altogether a wonderful book. So why am I giving it 3 stars, a \\"medium\\" score? Because as a parent, and from a \\"buyer beware\\" point of view, this edition is really quite a Whopper of a volume to handle for the age group of children it is intended for, similar in bulk to an encyclopedia. Our 3-yr.-old struggles with it a bit, but when our 1-yr-old tries to wrest it from the shelf we go running to prevent it from coming down on her foot. I was wondering whether it may have been wiser to go with the original \\"skinny\\" volumes with one story in each. Also, very early on with this book a page became detached during normal kids' handling, partly due to its cumbersome weight, or that the binding may not be sturdy enough for a volume of this size. So I'd advise, that if the parents are the ones who would handle the book as they read to their small children, then this really is \\"The Best of George\\" in one place. But if your kids like to pick out their own books and read, the thinner editions would be easier for them. For anyone yet unacquainted with these stories, a good place to start would be the special edition of the first story \\"Curious George\\" which features H.A. Rey's original watercolor illustrations, which were never published in the original editions due to limitations of the color-separation process. Another great classic children's favorite published the same year as Curious George - 1941 - is \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" by Robert McCloskey. The little ones never tire of it, and if you like antique cars and angelic policemen you'll get a kick out of it yourself!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album of t.A.T.u. is absolutely amazing, the sound that you find in this production is just cool, you can feel the power of this two russian girls in every lyric of their songs starting with All the Things She Said and also songs like Not Gonna Get Us<BR>and Show me Love theyre just spectacular.
B000003TA4|5.0|If you are thinkin of gettin this album,you have a serious promblem cause if you're thinkin of gettin it,it means you don't already have.So don't insult me anymore.
0151008116|2.0|I couldn't be more surprised that the Amazon.com editors chose this book to top their 2002 list.  Has it been that bleak of a fiction year?  Sad.  There is little about the story that of Pi made me feel compassion for his circumstances and condition.  The writing is decent, but nothing more.  The book is quite short and could have been printed on half of the pages used.  I recommend getting this one at the library, if at all.
0679736646|5.0|I first read this novel in 1965 when I was an undergraduate majoring in English. I was put off by the sometimes amateurish use of the Language Dick demonstrated. But when I had finished reading the book I realized my dislike of the prose was based more on the snobbery of an undergraduate English major than on anything substantive, and that the ideas stay with you forever. I just finished reading the book again, and it is as mind-bending in the twenty-first century as it was in the mid twentieth century. <br />Dick writes about the tentative nature of reality, the persistence of the human spirit and the ambiguity of Life itself. He does it with good humor on the one hand, and frighteningly accurate logic on the other. I look at _Ubik_ as Dick's search for God through Joe Chip, his _everyman_ protagonist. Whether Joe Chip finds God, or simply creates his own God is a question that may or may not be answered for the reader, but the beautiful audacity of the asking might be enough.
B000059PR3|3.0|A young professor, his Barbie-doll wife, and their young son go on a sabbatical.  They move into an old house by an ancient cemetery, and bloody death ensues.  After a steady diet of classic horror flicks and '50s style sci-fi schlock, come along as we venture into '80s stylized violence.  Talk about culture shock!  Vampires, werewolves, and radioactive dinosaurs seem mild compared to a deranged killer that sprays blood around in glorious color.  Horrible death notwithstanding, the scariest thing in this movie is the whiny little kid named Bob.  (Why pick on guys named Bob?).  Bob gets our vote for the Donnie Dunagan award.  Little Dunagan played the cutesy and annoying tyke in \\"Son of Frankenstein.\\"  Bob sees dead people, of course.  Mainly a little girl dressed in 19th century garb.  Also, he can't stay out of the basement.  The house is haunted by the undead remnant of Dr. Freudstein.  We assume that the Freud and Frankenstein family lines crossed at some point in the distant past.  Freudstein needs plentiful amounts of human blood to keep going.  The script has difficulty focusing between a slasher flick and a ghost story.  The plot is both suspenseful and silly.  At times, it even gets confusing.  Who, for example, is the enigmatic baby-sitter that has strange ties to a store-window mannequin?  The story doesn't conclude, it just stops after 80+ minutes.  Maybe they were setting up a sequel.  The killing is gory, but limited in scope.  There is not a new victim every five minutes.  Italian director Lucio Fulci enjoys a loyal following among genre fans and cult enthusiasts.  For collectors, this gem is worth the price. ;-)
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This like all of the Beatles number one songs. Such as \\"Love me do\\",\\"Day tripper\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\". This a real narly album. the beatles are like the best man and this CD is the best. The beatkes are like the best band in the world
B00005YXZH|5.0|From the cerebral audio brilliance of the opening track &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart&quot;, Wilco turns in perhaps their most radio friendly, yet artistically rewarding album to date. Picking up where &quot;Summer Teeth&quot; left off, Wilco sounds part classic R.E.M (&quot;Murmur&quot; through &quot;Life's Rich Pageant&quot;), part OK Computer-era Radiohead. The melodies on this album are as infectious as anything Tweedy has crafted so far and the songs are instantly memorable. &quot;Kamera&quot;, &quot;Pot Kettle Black&quot; and &quot;I'm The Man Who Loves You&quot; would not sound out of place on Beck's latest acoustic album. &quot;Heavy metal Drummer&quot; is downright danceable and proves how mind bogglingly eclectic this band is. This is one of the best albums of the year and a shame that very few people will probably get to hear it. A MUST own!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What can I say? If you liked the movie, you'll like the DVD. The extras are cute and funny instead of being hokey or dull. I especially liked the dance party and the interviews with the &quot;actors.&quot; This is one I will watch again and again. A definite classic.
6304806426|3.0|This film lacks a lot of things, in my opinion.  It lacks character development for the main characters, at least not enough.  It lacks more action!  It lacks more emphasis on its historical background of the war setting.  It seems like its doing too much and skipped through a whole bunch of why this person is like this, and why he or she acts that way, and how come this resulted, etc.  all emphasizing on character development.  Oscar quality?  On the cinematics and the acting but best film?! c'mon!  This movie didn't have much of a competition that year in the Oscars.<br />In comparison to the book, the movie skipped a lot of character development and did not enjoy it as much as the book, of course its a common result.  But there are films where the movie is just as good as the book and well-written and directed that correlates well with the book but this one was just disappointing.  I was bored.
067942850X|4.0|Into the wild is a great book by Jon Krakauer. It is about young man, who gives up his family,car,and money to go live in the wild with nothing really. He had a good education, fresh out of colledge and seemed to have a good life. But he was found dead up north around four months later by a moose hunter.
B00007E8V4|4.0|i mainly listen to other types of metal, stuff like immortal, marduk, king diamond, manowar, iron maiden, origin, cryptopsy, kataklysm, vintersorg, etc, etc... for the most part i cant stand the mainstream metal ... that so many people dig on, like linkin park and all that nonsense. it makes me vomit when people talk about system as rap metal or nu metal or whatever, when theyre just straight up plain 'metal'. a very unique band that makes killer music.. this cd is no exception, it and all system cds belong in EVERYONE's library, not just all the nu-metal pricks that buy their cds to look cool. whether youre a thug or a punk or a ... or any kind of fool that a real metalhead would want to kill, then you still need to at least hear this cd. system has always been innovative and original and will most likely always remain like they are, totally sweet and insane. theres not much to say about this album other than you should hear it. it will appeal to some people, others not, but all in all it's worth checking out. also, if any of you nu metal sissies think you can handle it, check out origin - informis infinitas inhumanitas or immortal - sons of northern darkness for some real metal. you should be able to get those at your local mall hangouts.
B00006JK1R|5.0|After having read the reviews for this movie I wasn't so sure I wanted to own it. Now that I have seen it ( more than once I might add) I think it's a great sequel! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make a great team in this second movie and although the villain in this movie (Serleena) is a bit cheezy, the storyline is entertaining and amusing and the special effects are excellent. If you liked the first MiB you will like this one as well.
B000000W5L|5.0|I would rank this as one of the top 10 Albums of all time. The Stones were at the height of their abilities when they created this album. If you are a Rolling Stones fan, do yourself a favor and obtain this album.
0767903862|5.0|It's easy to think of Australia as one big desert.  Bryson dispells this treatment with detailed and endearing descriptions of this expanisve land.  He makes you want to go there, while laughing all the way.  From the humor standpoint, this book is better than &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;  Bryson is also more insightful than many travel writers.
B00006X06U|5.0|Gosh, all you have to do is put one disk in and sit back<BR>and listen to the best pioneer,writer,painter,composer,lover<BR>of life and people,Joni. I melt when I heard just the few<BR>bars of Otis and Marlena. I have a bad habit of remembering<BR>how it was done on the album &quot;Don Juan&quot;. I think its better<BR>than her other try at &quot;Both sides now&quot;. Try to get the<BR>&quot;enhanced&quot; version(of course meaning their are clips that<BR>you can play on the computer,its great) Along with this<BR>you get a beautiful color booklet of her works. I had heard<BR>rumors of this CD being her last,maybe someone else can answer<BR>my question?I had seen Joni in NYC, back in Heijra days<BR>with Jaco. Iwas told she does not tour because she has <BR>a desease in her joints and cannot stand for long periods<BR>of time. But getting back to the cd,I had to hear every<BR>cut,its wonderful. Iam glad she is still using ex-Weather<BR>Report sax player/founder Wayne Shorter to put in that wonderful<BR>color. Please buy this CD,it just may be her last.......
B00006IUL7|2.0|OK.<br />Someone needs to tell Robin Williams that just because he's brilliant as a comedian, doesn't mean he should try everything else, too ... ?<br />If you're in mood to watch a movie of this style (serial killer, good cop, bad cop), please watch Summer of Sam! That was much more entertaining.
B000021Y77|5.0|This film is dificult to describe and do it justice. I found myself surprised to find it a refreshing story of love and comitment. Among the see of poor, sappy, shortsighted love stories this is an original, well paced impecibly directed, acted, etc. film that demonstrates the main characters devotion to the man she loves. However this devotion is not forced down the viewer's throat and most of the movie you believe you are watching a suspense drama when really you are watching diferent fates of a woman in love. A must have for anyone who loves good cinema, foreign films, love stories, suspense, or just a plain good flick.
6305508550|5.0|Unless you're some kind of out of space alian, you'll identify with some aspects of this movie.  The actors aren't Al Paccino or Robert De Niro, and believe me, you can tell, but that's not the point.  The movie itself is just soooooooooo funny (not silly, but funny) because it's picked out of real life.<br />It's like watching a stand up comedy.
B000065V1V|4.0|My girlfriend has always loved David Bowie's music and I have always shrugged it off even though I loved Labrynth and being in drama during high school the lively, energetic, spirited songs were a staple of late friday night set buildings but I had never heard any of his less popular work. So I saw the cd and decided to pick it up. I was happily surprised by the divirsity presented on the CD. The songs offered a range of musical styles and was overall a plesent experience and I would imagine is fairly representative of most of his recent work, worth the buy. My only complaint is about the CD itself. It features a CD-ROM portion for use on your computer and my car's and my stereo's CD player could not read the CD so I had to burn a copy on my computer then it worked. So beware
B00005JL78|4.0|This is another one of those movies where it starts well, and builds up and builds up and builds up only to crash the whole thing in 10-30 seconds at the end.<br />The ending was absolutely stupid and ruined the whole movie for me, but up to that point, it was entertaining so it's worth watching.
B000056QE5|5.0|Every song is a golden winner. From \\"A spoonful of sugar, I love to laugh\\" to the Oscar winning \\"Chim chim cherrie\\". This definetely Walt Disney's best. Julie Anrews voice is fantastic.
B00006L83N|5.0|This cd rates 5 stars for &quot;The Odyssey&quot; alone...the 24 minute epic is a masterpiece....ranks up there with &quot;Six Degrees..&quot; from Dream Theater...and then there's the rest of the cd...being a big fan of Symphony X, I ordered this cd expecting more of the same, and it doesn't disappoint..from start to finish, this cd rocks as hard as any cd i've purchased in years.....which includes Dream Theater, of whom, i'm also a big fan...
0440229081|5.0|I really love skellig. Although I'm only on chapter 30, I love it. I like the way David Almond puts a turning point in and how the book has a continuing pattern on birds. I really pay my respects to David Almond as he inspires me to write my own stories. I have already wrote 5 and on my way to doing 6. So if you are reading this David Almond, thank you and please email me. I would like a friend to email, especially a famous one.
B000065U1N|5.0|Hollywood has a terrible history of taking events that could be great &quot;eye-opening&quot; movies and flipping them into a typical bloody, glorious war flick.  Nearly all of the time, however, war is far from glorious.  This is the first accurate attempt that hollywood has made at making an &quot;action&quot; movie realistic.  It shows the horrors of war, and describes a historical event, one which not many people knew about, and turned it into an educational yet still catching film, exposing the true face of war.  This well-done movie is a must-see!
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is the most ear splitting, smashing dvd I have ever seen.  I just recently got into Slipknot.  I thought the bled and cut themselves on stage, but I was completely wrong.  The concert is in  London.  Its about an hour and 24 minutes long.  Out the time they show you thirty diffrent angles og them performing.  They are great band because they are not sic freaks.  They just head bang to some kick butt music.  Out of the 1 hour and 24 minute long concert you see about 15 minutes of normal fans jumping up and down.  So you see alot of Slipknot performing.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In typical chris cornell fashion, this album rocks!  i never liked ratm, but i love this album.  if you like it, you should also try Down On the Upside by Soundgarden, his former band.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I don't think anyone had reason to expect an album of this caliber from George Harrison at this late date. <br />But BRAINWASHED is no ALL THINGS MUST PASS, no matter what a few dander-headed mass media spin doctors have been saying over the past few weeks. ATMP was a flood of Rock masterpieces that Harrison had saved up for years, a spiritual announcement that created an entirely new genre of music; BRAINWASHED is a bright and sunny collection of fine Pop tunes. They're both grand records in their own light, but comparing the two is like comparing albino mice to Saturn's rings...what's the point?<br />What I find most surprising on BRAINWASHED are Harrison's vocals. When has he ever sang lead so well? There is a depth and resonance in his voice here that hasn't been captured on record before. <br />I've been trying to narrow down to 2 or 3 my favorite songs on BRAINWASHED and I just can't do it. The man had trouble putting together solid LPs his whole career, always putting a couple of classics amidst a stack of faceless meanderings, but that trap is avoided here. True, there aren't any tunes I would call classic or life-changiing, but everything is solid. \\"Any Road,\\" \\"P2 Vatican Blues,\\" \\"Run So Far,\\" \\"Rocking Chair In Hawaii,\\" and the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\" are all fine stuff, and I have to admit I've listened to \\"Between The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" about 16,000 times already and loved it more each time.<br />There is a bit of that Traveling Wilburys sound on BRAINWASHED, which makes complete sense since half of that band collaborated on this CD. But, while I liked the Wilburys, I think this is more of a complete record than they ever put together. I have none of the complaints about Jeff Lynne's production that I've heard from some others; I don't see the walls of flowery mush they point fingers at. I always wanted to hear Harrison do those lush choir-like multiple vocals he did on ALL THINGS MUST PASS again, but I suppose that just wasn't in the cards for this record.<br />This is not a great record--it never tries to be--but it is a very good one, better than 95 percent of the junk being released today. It may not be ALL THINGS MUST PASS, but it's certainly better than 33-1/3 or GONE TROPPO--or WALLS AND BRIDGES or LONDON TOWN, for that matter.<br />A lot more fun than the typical Harrison album, BRAINWASHED seems like a fine, fond farewell from the most misunderstood Beatle. He was witty, wise, occasionally caustic, a bit eccentric, and was the Fab'er to have found a way to live the All You Need Is Love life within the framework of a Pop star lifestyle. When I think of Lennon I can't help but think of his odd-politics of the early and mid-1970s, but when I think of Harrison I see the monk-ish poster from ALL THINGS MUST PASS and the nerd-gone-cool kid dancing to his own lead guitar part on Ed Sullivan. I think, in the end, he got to say goodbye to this world the way he wanted.<br />Now if only Clapton can find a way to release the Harrison tribute concert on CD...
B00003CX5P|2.0|As a lot of people already said, it's a great DVD but a bad movie.<BR>As a Star Wars fan it was very sad for me to see the myth broken in pieces.<BR>The special effects are great, the customs are beautiful and... there nothing more.<br />It was like looking a special effects presentation with poor dialogs, actors and a long so on. The worse of course, was Jar Jar Binks and all it's tribes... simply annoying, stupid and disturbing. The pod racer has great effects but i felt on a children movie with the two head creature narrator making jokes all the time, Java getting sleep and all sort of silly jokes.<br />Don't know what Lucas had in mind, but the history was the last anyway; is like the ending of the Return of the Jedi, too much idiot creatures (the ewoks) doing silly jokes and less smart and interesting dialogs. As much as i love the first 3 movies i hate this one. Sad to say but true.
B000002UAO|5.0|It absolutely puzzles me at those who profess to be Beatles fans and refer to 'Rubber Soul' as anything but an audio masterpiece.  I am one of the fortunate few who have a career in radio where I actually get PAID to listen to music -- specifically Beatles music.  Now I am far from an expert on recording songs, but I DO know what sounds good, and I have NO reservations whatsoever in ranking 'Rubber Soul' right up there with some of the greatest albums of all time.  <br />There is a good reason why The Beatles are considered the greatest rock & roll band of all-time: they produced incredible music -- a LOT of it, in a relatively short amount of time -- AND they sold an amazing amount of records (and still do).  You'd think that this would diminish over time, but it hasn't.  In 2000 The Beatles were the BIGGEST selling group on the planet...not bad for a band that hadn't fully recorded together since 1970 (not counting their 2-new songs off Anthology released in 1995).  What is it about their music that refuses to die?  <br />'Rubber Soul' captured their raw and improving talent with some of their best work.  'In My Life' was voted by the British Songwriters in 2000 as the greatest rock & roll song written in the 20th century...while this may be in dispute with some, there is NO denying the fact that John, Paul, George & Ringo had a passion about what they did, and with the guiding hands of producer George Martin, they were able to refine that talent and passion into true works of art.  No matter what you think about the Fab Four, you just simply cannot escape the fact that their universal likeability stems from their charisma, vocal talent and truly amazing ability to write music.  Paul has been ranked by Guiness as the most successful musical composer in all of recorded history, and although Paul was (and is) a great songwriter, John Lennon was his equal I believe in every way, and they were even better together than apart.  One must wonder whether a true Beatle reunion would have happened had Mark David Chapman not gone off the deep end and shot John in 1980...but I suppose we can all 'Imagine'...
B00006BTCA|5.0|In a search of something fresh and brand new, I've managed to stumble upon this album. I don't want to say that I was completely oblivious of a band called &quot;Interpol.&quot;  It was easy to say that this band has established an extremely high status in the college music world.  But I never seeked out and try to find them when I heard their name over the radio.  Instead, I managed to pick up their sound in a local music store, at a listening station.  When I channelled into their first &quot;intro&quot; song I immediately grabbed the album and threw my money at the cash register.  I flew to my apartment and started playing Interpol.  The music took me by surprise because I never thought I would listen to any music that was close to this type of sound.<br />But I did.  And I'm listening to them right now.<br />I guess that's cheating, listening to the band I'm writing a review on.  But, Man!  These guys are simply amazing!  When I'm listening to them I feel like I'm in another dimension!<br />Ok, this review didn't really explain the album at all.  But I just wanted to share my experience with this band.

B000002RXS|5.0|\\"Carmen\\" is a great opera to start one's introduction to the magical world that is opera.  Georges Bizet wrote an opera with cohesive dramatic tension, finely-delineated characters, wonderful music, and pulsing energy.  \\"Carmen\\" is truly a masterpiece.  No wonder it is one of the most performed operas in the world's opera houses.<br />Maria Callas is one of the greatest sopranos of the past century.  On this recording, we can see why.  She is Carmen.  There is none of the annoying bitchiness or overdone sexual flirtatiousness in her portrayal of the fiery, independent Gypsy that one gets so often with other interpreters of the role.  Her phrasing is marvellous.  Her French is surprisingly good.  Not every \\"r\\" is rolled but that can be forgiven due to the fact that Callas was not a native French speaker.  I wish there had been spoken dialogue included in this recording.  It would have been a joy to hear Callas speaking French.<br />Callas does a great job with Carmen's ear-pleasing melodies.  The \\"Habañera\\" is done at a faster pace than most other versions.  It seems more appropriate with fast tempo than with the slow, ponderous tempo that one finds so often on other recordings.  Callas' voice had deteriorated greatly by 1964, the year this recording was made.  However, this opera's music rarely strains her voice.  Carmen's mezzo-soprano tessitura is negotiated comfortably by Callas.  Her dark voice and its strong chest register lend a haunting quality to the \\"Habañera\\" that seems perfectly appropriate.  Her toying with Don José's emotions is totally convincing.  Her rendition of the \\"Bohemian Dance\\" is very well done.  Her trill in that aria is fake but who cares?  Carmen is not a coloratura role.  Callas' control of emotions is amazing.  She never overacts in this role, which is a role that is too often acted in an overly melodramatic way.  Her anger and defiance in the last scene are examples of her great mastery of vocal acting.  <br />Gedda is an excellent Don José.  He sings with honeyed tone and superb French diction.  When he sings in French, he can do no wrong, unlike when he sings in Italian.  He makes some very beautiful sounds.  His sincere, dedicated singing makes his portrayal of the love-struck Don José totally convincing.  His high notes in his big aria are very beautiful and well done.<br />The other singers do a fine job singing in their native tongue.  Prêtre does a wonderful job conducting.  He uses faster tempo than is normally heard in recordings of this opera, but he is totally correct in his decision to do so.  Bizet's music sounds better and much more exciting when it is played fast than when it is played slow.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's 1997 Grammy Nominated OK Computer won the hearts of many fans and won much respect for the band. This album is much more than just a chart topping rock album. This album defines a new kind of rock music...a kind that takes your heart on an emotional roller coaster through all of life's ups and downs, and leaves you feeling the melancholia of Radiohead's style. I don't think any band out there could even come close to matching Radiohead's beauty and strength that is injected into every album they create. Onto the album...<BR>the album breaks out with its first track, Airbag...which at first the swirling guitars leave you in a daze, but then take you on a ride when Thom York starts singing his dreamy voice...\\"I am born again...An interstellar crash...I'm back to save the universe\\". <BR>After the industrial melodies of Airbag, the track follows beautifully into Paranoid Android, a six minute tune which I will admit is a bit weird at first, but you get into it after the first minute or so and completely get into it.<BR>Subterranean Homesick Alien is one of the better ones on this album, although I must say that it's hard to choose favorites when you're talking about Radiohead. The song starts with a spacy guitar, then followed by the steady bass and the awesome drum work. The lyrics will take you on a ride, explaning the fantasy of being taken aboard an alien ship and being shown the world \\"as I've never seen it\\". <BR>The dark, mellow acoustic Exit Music will leave you feeling desolate and weird inside...but altogether sends a chill down your spine. Sort of freaky, but a really good tune to listen to at night while you're driving. <BR>Let Down is probably the saddest song on the album. The lyrics will make you tremble at the knees, and the absolutely beautiful music composition will make you break down and cry. Nuff said. <BR>Karma Police just plain rawks, and it's a catchy song...the lyrics are pretty cool too. <BR>Fitter Happier, although not really a song, defines what this album is about--humankind being controlled by computers. The obscure lyrics of this poetic track make it hard to understand, but it's great nonetheless. <BR>Electioneering is a rather different tune, and although I didn't like it at first, I gave it some time and it's a pretty catchy tune as well. <BR>Crawling Up The Walls is a great tune...it's filled with bass and distorted vocals. It can either come across to you as completely annoying or really cool. As you can tell I think it {is awesome]....<BR>No Surprises is one of the best songs on the album...this is another song that will give you goosebumps and a tear to your eye. A standout song that is a fan favorite.<BR>The guitar driven Lucky will also catch your ears, and this song has quite a bit of Pink Floyd influence. Great song that just rocks.<BR>The dreamy, echoey, slow pace of The Tourist will captivate you as well...a great slow tune, and was a superb choice to end the album with. Hey man...slow down....slow down...<BR>All in all, this album is a piece of art, and should never be forgotten. If you are having any decision or doubt in purchasing this album, BUY IT. I PROMISE YOU...you won't be unsatisfied. An album that proves it's money's worth.
B00006CXSS|5.0|In a word this is great.  You will never find a better Western Front WW2 movie/series.  <br />Be warned though: do not expect non-stop action.  The 5 minute interviews with the members of the real 501st PIR at the beginning and endings of each episode might not be your thing.  I however love WW2 history and even watched the bonus documentery =)  <br />If you trust what strangers think then definatly get this package.  You wont find it cheaper than what Amazon has advertised though, believe me I checked.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie.  It is just so fun and bright.  I think Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as Elle.  Now I watch the movie anytime I just need a lift cause it always brightens my day, especially when Elle recieves her score for the LSAT's.  I know thats hokey, but I always cheer for her at that part.  I admire her character because of her complete openess to people and her genuine caring nature.  I think that is something that many more people would benefit for having, and it is great to see an example of this in a movie.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|This was Madonna's second release and the one that made the freakishly huge star that she remains to this day. The hits from this cd are the classic \\"Like A Virgin\\",\\"Material Girl\\",\\"Angel\\",\\"Dress You Up\\" and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\". The cd also features some of Madonna's best non hits like \\"Stay\\",\\"Over And Over\\" and my favorite \\"Shoo-bee-doo\\". This cd also features the original 12\\" mixes of \\"Like A Virgin\\"(6:08) and \\"Material Girl\\"(6:07). My only gripe is that if Warner Brothers was going to put 12\\" mixes of the songs then include \\"Angel\\" and \\"Dress You Up\\" as well. Oh well - this was produced by Nile Rodgers after his work with Diana Ross, Debbie Harry and David Bowie and shows his growth at working and allowing the artist a chance to grow too.
0790732254|5.0|In 2002, with an audience of young 20-somethings, everyone found this movie as fascinating as I remembered it from my youth. It still works powerfully, evocatively, at many levels, leaving many open questions, provoking debate. And it's terrifically entertaining. But it makes life in the modern world seem rather hopeless, really, no matter how you look at it. <br />By the way, with all the mind-boggling verbal pyrotechnics in this movie, most people don't notice how thoughtful and dizzyingly innovative the editing and camerawork are. It's still as fresh as ever.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This is the album that launched her to the world and she has never looked back since. This album I orginally bought in late 1983 and again on cd in early 1987 and is one of my favorites because she isn't trying to be anything but a dance artist and the songs showcase a vibrant energy that most of her later work doesn't have. In 1982 the dance community got the first glance at her with the 12&quot;s of &quot;Everybody&quot;,&quot;Phyical Attraction&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot;. The came &quot;Holiday&quot; in 1983 and the rest is history. &quot;Holiday &quot; remains my favorite Madonna song of all time because she is at ease and happy and that energy in any form of music is very very rare . This new remastered cd features the 12&quot; mixes of &quot;Lucky Star&quot;(7:15) and &quot;Burning Up&quot;(5:56) which were mixed by then boyfriend Jellybean Benitez. Classic Madonna from start to finish.
0790729628|3.0|I'll start with the positive: the set design for this movie is still fascinating, years later. Some of the street level plaster work looks kind of unlikey, as do a couple of the painted panoramas. But it's still quite stunning to look at. That's really where the movie sticks with you.<br />But otherwise, it's very weakly put together. The acting is fine, but the dialogue is paced and unnatural and cheesy. And the editing in this director's cut, like the original cut, is very sloppy in places -- for example there's a scene that's supposed to represent hours of interviews, which messes up the time passage device. There's an editing mistake like this every two or three minutes, with bad continuity, and it's really irritating. It's like reading someone's bad spelling & grammar, and weak story-telling, with extraordinary penmanship. And its relationship to Philip K. Dick is tepid. Rent this one ... you won't watch it more than once.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Not too thrilled with Josh Groban's DUET with Barbra, but Streisand's voice still to me is considered the best voice than any other female singer out there. It would have been great if this CD had all new material. Barbra rules !!!
0066214122|4.0|Red Herring magazine predicted a nanotech backlash as a top ten trend for 2003. Allusions were made to Jurassic Park, and its associated scare. Why not visit Foresight Institute's website, and their guidelines for safe development of nanotech/nanoscale science? David Forrest wrote some guidelines back in 1988 and is associated with IMM. Why throw away the upside? Work to limit the downside and maximize the upside. Enjoy the book, inform yourself with Foresight's mission, and try and limit Red Herring's prediction. Have fun, because its going to be a rather long haul to robust commercializtion.
B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie has outdone himself this time.  I feel that this album shows more of Robbie as an individual along with  how he is seen through the public eye.  My favorite song on the album is also the song that I can see recieving the most critism.  \\" Handsome Man\\" is a track in which Robbie talks about how the public has viewed him for sometime now.  He is coming out on this album and saying that all we as his fans have to do is stop listening to him and stop buying his albums and he will fade away and no longer be the \\"Worlds Most Handsome Man\\".  So if I to choose today an album that I can see myself listening to for years to come it would be this one.  Robbie may be huge in the UK but with this album I can see him breaking the barrier and becoming one of America's lasting pop stars.  Do yourself a favor and buy the album that landed the number one spot on the British pop charts.  I promise you won't regret it.  \\" No regrets, They don't work.\\"
B00006IU73|4.0|November 2nd, 2002 - I go to a Yes concert.  I get there early enough to witness the opening band, Porcupine Tree.  As soon as I get there, I am instantly drawn into the band.  I know almost nothing about them, yet something still pulls me to enjoy there music, and I do.  I am not one who loves something they hear upon first listening to it, but I LOVE this.  I truely love it.<br />I get home, and decide that I need to order this CD.  So I do.<br />I love it still.
0060526491|5.0|Come on, look at the title, how many other \\"teen\\" books have you seen with the words \\"melancholy\\" and \\"death\\" in them? No one is marketing this as a teen book. Please don't let the last reviewer's ignorance dissuade you, this is a great book for anyone with a love of Tim Burton's aesthetic and wry humor. I would suggest the other edition (in black) because it's a great looking book...
B000058BGZ|5.0|I've heard two recordings of this work in the past and thought it was just ugly music.  Then I heard this incredible performance.  It is so clear, so precise, so exciting!  I will listen to it again and again.  This is the one to buy.  It's wonderful!
014043786X|4.0|Personally, I always preferred the Sherlock Holmes short stories, but two the the novels are very good: The Sign of Four, and this little masterpiece.<br />Like many of the Sherlock Holmes stories, the plot is not really worthy of the characters and the moody setting that Conan Doyle establishes so well.  But here the mood is so well established, and so central to the success of the work, that we barely notice the fact that the murderer's identity is somewhat obvious.  The horror of the lonely hills and swamps, and the unknown menace of the hound permeate every chapter of the book, and the general sense of confusion and dread is heightened by the fact that Holmes himself is absent for much of the first half.  We can feel Watson's anxiety as he tries to protect Sir Henry Baskerville, and share his relief when the great detective finally re-emerges.<br /> Supporting characters like Dr. Mortimer, the Barrymore's, and Stapleton are well drawn, but as usual, the true delight is in the characters of Holmes and Watson, and their interaction with one another.
0375414053|3.0|Can someone believe that this woman who earns enough to support her father's debits, pay even riding lessons for her nanny, armani suits, cannot simply ask her Oh so precious nanny to homebake pies for the school or even contract a baker to do it? How about her husband, why don't he bake thoses pies? Is he a dad or is he dead? The daughter is his also. As for me, living in AZ, USA, all the schools that my kids attended simply PROHIBIT any home baking goods, can only bring store bought ones (Serious! ), I couldn't be more happy. I give 3 stars because that issue about her mother-in-law asking why her son is thinner/tired etc rings true. I don't know why this PTA issue is so famous to be written, I have kids at school, PTA meeting occur only 2 in half an year, Christmas program, only once an year, it is not that much to busy a working mother like that, by the way, Mrs. Reddy could even pay well her \\"poor\\"mother to care for the kids. I think her story is so exaggerated, she earns well to wear Armani,rides taxi everyday, could even have a Fleet of nannies to do it all for her.
B000060OFT|5.0|This is a great version of Romeo &amp; Juliet...<BR>Its set in a different time period &amp; has more action &amp; more romance<BR>Its a classic movie turned into a more convincing love story!
B000001EMW|5.0|I can't believe what I have discovered here.  Im so blown away.  I don't even like Metallica that much.  Yes there is something special about Metallica though.  They have this dark, almost medival sound that you must listen carefuly for.  Nobody else has that.  This band Apocalyptica captures it completely!!!  Better than even Metallica can!!  Its like a band has taken another bands music, and perfectly, beautifuly spelled out for you what you love about it!!!  I was skeptical at first.  Sounds so corny.  4 Cellos play white trashy metal.  But.....its amazing.  Keep an open mind.  It is note for note.  Listen to it for the darkness.  Very ancient sounding, almost religious.  Once in a while you discover something really special.  It doesnt happen often because there are no resources like Mtv for great music.  Only crap.  This is special.
B000056VPD|4.0|George Benson in it's best performance. Personally, I like the new musics. The sound of this DVD is like an accoustic one (DTS), it is excellent.
B00006YXEK|5.0|This CD is a complete masterpiece! Each song is breathtakingly beautiful. I can't get enough of our Sweet George and play this CD nearly every day. I have every George CD (including \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Electronic Sound\\") and I must say that \\"Brainwashed\\" is fast becoming a favorite, although I love them all.<br />All I have to say to Jeff Lynne is \\"fantastic work!\\". As usual, Jeff works his magic as he always does. Jeff, you are great and you will always have the \\"magic touch\\". I don't understand why so many people pick on Jeff, because my boyfriend and I have always loved anything that Jeff is involved in. <br />I purchased the enhanced, black box version of \\"Brainwashed\\" and couldn't be more pleased with the whole package. What beautiful packaging!! It is well worth the few extra dollars for such a beautiful box and the goodies inside. Yes, I think George is very correct in seeing us all as crash test dummies brainwashed by what is fed to us by the media.<br />To everyone that complains about the DVD being too short....get over it! We are lucky that we got anything! For only seven minutes, it really packs a punch and is very satisfying. Of course, I wanted more, but am extremely happy with what was offered. I believe that George would be pleased with how this package is presented along with the work done to his music.<br />A must buy if you are a George fan.
B000002UAU|5.0|This was the 1st Beatles album I bought, 1977, age 12. This uncanny masterpiece got it's title from Paul who was looking for long names like the San Francisco bands had. Once he told John, \\"We're just getting fan mail from lonely people. We're nothing but a lonely hearts club band\\"...and the rest, as they say, is history. John had the idea of a circus-like atmosphere, and the song Strawberry Fields was to originally be in the album.<br /><br />This psychedelic trip into '60s consciousness begins with an orchestra warming up, and they launch into the title song with Paul's full throated vocals. He then introduces \\"Billy Shears\\" and Ringo sings.<br /><br /> Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds follows this, and John says it was Julian's drawing that gave him the title...you decide. Getting Better is a great anti-school song and a throwback to the skiffle days, using a bunch of random objects for the rhythm. (Paul performed this song for the 1st time on his recent US tour) Fixing a Hole is a trippy foray into Paul's dreamworld of higher consciousness. She's Leaving Home is a great classical stab at the '60s generation gap (Paul performed this on the recent fall tour) Mr. Kite is the circus song, featuring a pipe organ and lyrics taken directly from an antique circus poster...typical Lennon humor.<br /><br />Side 2 starts with George's Eastern mysticism with \\"Within You Without You\\" using Ravi Shankar's sitar-based Indian Raga which caused a musical and spiritual revolution. When I'm 64 Paul said he wrote as a teen, but added the \\"64\\" in honor of his father then 64 (Now Paul is 60). Lovely Rita was written from the perspective of a shy guy who wants to ask out a meter maid.<br /><br />Good Morning is a rock masterpiece, but John didn't agree.  Then Reprise, and finally A Day in the Life, a great psychedelic song by John with Paul's interlude and a 40 piece orchestra recreating a drug rush.  On the original British LP there was single groove of gibberish at the end, now a collectors item.
0425170349|1.0|This book lends further credence to Galton's principle of &quot;regression to mediocrity.&quot; Not only does Mr. Clancy give readers a feeble conclusion to his tangled plot, but he also managed to give the impression that the reader is in a video game, with the end of each chapter leading to a higher level of difficulty for Mr. Clark and his team. <br />I was one of those tricked by the &quot;TOM CLANCY&quot; on the front cover of this book. If you want to be entertained while getting some insight about the world we live in, get a good history book. That would be a better use of your time and money. To Mr. Clancy, thank you for sharing with us your exceptional stories, but I think your Ryan and Clark franchise has already ran out of steam.
6305508550|4.0|If you've ever worked in a cubicle farm, spoken &quot;corporatese,&quot; or dealt with downsizing, you'll find Office Space to be hilariously relevant.  Created by Mike Judge of Beavis and Butthead fame, this movie could easily pass for a live-action version of the Dilbert cartoon.  It pokes fun at everything from commuting to office birthday parties to &quot;fast casual&quot; chain restaurants.  Watching Office Space, you will vicariously get the satisfaction of &quot;sticking it to the man.&quot;  Ron Livingston plays the lead role well, but the funniest characters are the supporting cast - Milton, Lundbergh, Drew, et. al.  I'm going to need you to go ahead an watch Office Space...yeah...that would be great...
B000002AGE|5.0|As a music-love, this album is one of my favorites.  As a bassist, Jaco's playing boggles my mind.  His &quot;Teen Town&quot; and the incredibly funky playing on Zawinul's &quot;Birdland&quot; demonstrate a mastery of an instrument that few have ever attained.  &quot;Rhumba Mama&quot; at first seems out of place until the back &amp; forth calls subside &amp; the percussion  duet picks up speed.  &quot;Palladium&quot; is a great song, with Jaco's playing again supported everything Zawinul &amp; Shorter wrote for this band.  &quot;A Remark You Made&quot; is classic Weather Report, and &quot;Havona&quot; has a driving drum groove provided by Alex Acu&ntilde;a.  Zawinul's supportive chordal textures provide a backdrop for Jaco's ghost-noted funk/fusion line and Shorter's high soprano line leaps from note to note.
B000069HKH|4.0|I haven't owned a Springsteen album since &quot;Born in the USA,&quot; which it seemed that everyone listened to in the '80's.  So I'm not exactly a big fan.  But I like real music, as opposed to the vanilla teeny-pop, rap-metal, and cookie-cutter-country that gets pumped out of studios like so many McNuggets these days.  Springsteen has reassembled the E Street band for this album and together they really make music.  It's a great full sound with complex harmonies and multiple layers.  My main complaint is that the songs tend to sound somewhat the same after a while, especially the lyrics.  All in all, however, this is one of the best albums of the year and worth adding to your collection.
B0000062FN|5.0|For those of you who listened to \\"Shaman\\" and threw it away either have this album or have heard all the songs on it. This is the Santana that we all know and love. The best of all of Santana's releases (there are some good ones too)and probably the most energetic. I could listen to this album a thousand times and not tire of it. It is Santana in top form.<BR>DIG IT!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I like all kinds of music, including the old jazz greats.  Norah Jones is just a really welcome change from the stuff coming out of major studios these days.  True musical talent seems hard to find among the oceans of teeny-pop, rap-metal, and cookie-cutter country.  Norah Jones isn't just some pretty face dressed up for MTV; she's a MUSICIAN in every sense of the word.  There is hardly anyone else out there recording this kind of soulful voice work.  Kudos to Norah Jones, and thanks for giving us some real music to listen to again.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|i have loved this movie ever since it came out and i still love it. however on the new platinum edition disc they have made the colors in the movie so much brighter, it gives off the saturday morning cartoon effect. but nothing can change how i feel i about this movie. i highly recommend it!
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; is highly impressive.  The songs are wonderfully written and generally very catchy.  They really market her well with her skater/punk image.  The &quot;I'm real&quot; persona is so &quot;in&quot; right now.  Whether Avril's image is &quot;real&quot; or not matters little here.  What matters is the music.  And the music on her debut CD is awesome.  Despite her punk rocker style, Avril probably has more in common with Deborah (Debbie) Gibson than Kelly Osbourne.  For one thing, Avril demonstrates a promising long-term career in music.  When I first her &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio, the song and her sound instantly caught my attention.  I knew she would be a huge hit.  My other favorite song is &quot;Skaer Boi&quot; which really solifies Avril's image and really hones in at her target audience.  Avril also fares well on down-tempo ballads with her whispy vocals.  I saw her MTV's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Live performance and her vocals were not very good.  So I think she needs to work on her vocals for live performances.  But Avril has amazing stage presencen, energy and spunk.  Avril looks poised to be the Alanis Morrissette of the new generation.  If you're turned off by the whole skater/punk image, look pass it because the music on this CD is really great.

0066214122|4.0|If nothing else, Crichton has opened up the world of nanotech to the mass audience, science and science fiction on the level of space travel since it has so many uses, from cellular repair in Cryonics patients,to manufacture of microscopic computer chips. The story is fast moving, and aside from the rather thin character development,offers terrific and fresh new reading.
0066214122|3.0|First off, I accidentally read two sentences in the front sleeve, and then I read the excerpt before page 1, and I immediately knew what the problem was, and how the problem would be solved.  Unfortunately, Crichton decided to spend half the book building a mystery that is answered on the front sleeve of the book.  The mystery falls flat, as the main character thinks his wife is cheating. Of course, that is not true, but it takes Crichton a heck of lot of time to get to the point.  His \\"insights\\" into Silicon Valley are pretty much an extrapolation of stereotypes.  <br />About 140 pages into it, he finally starts the darn book as the main character gets to Nevada.  It's a finally action packed, fluid, and fun, despite the fact that it feels like a blatant [take] of the movie Tremors.  But hey, it was a good movie.  Just replace worms with nano-particles, and you've got the same thing.<br />Then, in the ending, it gets truly surreal with the typical hack ending.  The last twenty pages are pretty much a yawner.<br />His classic fluidity, and the 100 pages of action are what makes this book somewhat enjoyable.  <BR> <BR>Without a doubt, one of his worst books.  Timeline and now this.  It seems like Crichton's career is just about winding down.  Maybe he and Tom Clancy can move in with other Al Gore, MC Hammer, Michael Jordan, and other has beens.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This production is a strong one because it is performed as the composer intended. Unlike the pretentious Boulez Ring this is how we are meant to experience Wagner. The full heroic myth unfolds admirably. It is a visual feast and has first class  musical values. This is the Ring I will watch, until Solti's Ring is computer animated!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave, a brand new group formed from the ashes of Rage Against the Machine, may be our last best hope for originality and innovation in an era of stagnation and imitation.<br />If you were expecting Rage Against the Machine with a new vocalist, you had the wrong idea at the outset.  Audioslave is a new band, with different agendas both musically and politically.  Gone are the overtly and bluntly political lyrics, and gone also is Zack De La Rocha's volatile and contentious personality.  What we're left with takes the incendiary musicianship of Tom Morello, Brad Wilk and YTimK and blends it with the introspective lyrical and vocal stylings of the best vocalist to come out of Seattle's grunge scene.<br />\\"Cochise\\" is the leadoff track, and it hits like a right cross to the jaw.  Morello's guitar is instantly familiar to Rage fans, and Cornell's trademark raw-edged scream compliments the sound perfectly.  After the first minute of the song, I realized that this was a new group and was taking the talents of all four band members to new levels that their previous bands had not reached.<br />I also recommend looking for the video, it's in pretty decent rotation on Much Music and eMpTyVee, and the simple motif of the band performing under a galaxy of brilliant pyrotechnics says more about the stripped-down nature of the band than any reviewer or analyst ever could.<br />The album is mature and well-balanced.  Audioslave rides the musical rollercoaster from the up-tempo \\"Hypnotize\\" to the crushing \\"Exploder\\" and \\"Set it off.\\"  In a diversion from the Rage formula, there are also gentler and more melodic tracks like \\"Getaway Car\\", \\"I Am The HIghway\\", and \\"Like a Stone.\\"<br />Cornell's lyrics avoid the overtly political (deliberately, I'm told: apparently Cornell did not want to get into that arena, and I'm sure Morello agreed, otherwise too many people would assume this was \\"Rage Against the Machine with a new singer\\", and that's clearly not the case), but tracks like \\"Exploder\\" certainly make subtle reference to political themes.<br />I think Audioslave displays a new hope for music in general, and hard rock in particular, because it features talented musicians writing excellent and listenable songs that are not cut from the current \\"me too\\" cloth of rap-metal.  Don't get me wrong, there are some good bands out there in the sea of imitators, but right now we're seeing the predictable glut of Limp Wrizted and Korn clones that are following in the wake of both of those bands' success.<br />The record companies assume that what we want is more of the same, so they push lousy bands at us and wait for the dollars to roll in.  Someone should tell them (vote with your wallets, friends) that what we want is more bands like Audioslave.  No, no NO, not ones that *sound* the same, but ones that make good use of their talent, influences, and innovative spirit to give us something new, different, and enjoyable.  Bravo, Audioslave.<br />Rage and Soundgarden are dead.

1559408855|5.0|This film has been called trash, a waste of celluloid among other things. I disagree. The film's main purpose was to show the things that happen in the world that no one cares to know about. Schindler's List did much of the same for instance showing prison camps. Now if Steven Spielberg would have gone indepth to show you many of the horrifying things that really happened ie...pumping fluids into the brain till the fluid burst through the eyes, sewing people together, freezing and burning flesh and so on...you would have a modern SALO. Pasolini, basically instead of hinting at the horrors, showed you up close and personal what kind of things really happened in fascist Italy in WWII. Granted it's based on Marquis de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom which described many of the horrors he witnessed while imprisoned. However, it is not unlikely that scenes portrayed in SALO did really happen to someone during that time period. Anyway, to make a long story short...yes it is a hard film to watch and it will desensitize you, but it will also open your eyes to what men are capable of.

B000002I2G|4.0|Although it is generally the least liked Doors album it has a great feel and sounds fairly decent.<BR>It starts off with the most obscure,un-chararistic,bizzare, out-of-place Doors song there is. And its beatuiful. No, it isn't<BR>a normal Doors song but &quot;Tell All the People&quot; is still good, inspite of the brass. &quot;Touch Me&quot; is one of the Doors staples for greatest hits albums as well it should be. &quot;Shaman's Blues&quot; is one of the Doors best songs and the best track on this album, with its eire sound and excellent lyrics, if you only buy the album for this song your money was well spent. &quot;Do It&quot; and &quot;Easy Ride&quot; are basically fillers but are relatively high quality for the non essential role they play in the whole album. &quot;Wild Child&quot; is one of the Doors better songs as well but is always left of the new &quot;Best of&quot; releases. &quot;Runnin Blue&quot; is good but if there is any wonder why Jim Morrison was the lead singer than you can put all your wonderings to rest once you hear Robby Kreiger sing lead on the chorus to this one! &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; is pretty good and sounds like it could have come off of &quot;Waiting For the Sun&quot;. &quot;The <BR>Soft Parade&quot; is another Doors epic and is right up there with the other ones (&quot;The End&quot;,&quot;When The Music's Over&quot;,&quot;The Celebration Of the Lizzard&quot;, &quot;Riders On the Storm&quot; and &quot;LA Woman&quot;).

0425163407|3.0|Patricia Cornwall writes a standard novel where the usual murder occurs. It's the type of novel that says muder-comes-someone-finds-out-with-twist. The main problem with Cornwall's style is not the muder or evidence or list of suspects with the final twist, but the main character herself. Kay Scarpetta seema to be a smart forsenics scientist who has a hard a burdenful life. AS you read, her character doesn't really appeal to you. She seems to love her job but hate her life. This is my first Cornwall novle and I have to say I am not impressed. I felt that Scarpetta needed some medication to enlighten her depressing aura. I felt so tired of her problems and langorous lifef that I wasn't even able to finish the entire novel.
B00006YXE4|5.0|God (aka Eric Clapton) came back to earth on tour with some of his angels (aka EC's Band) to play some of the best music...<br />I went to the concert when he came to Venezuela and I must say that it was the best concert I've ever been to. Now been able to recreate with this masterpiece every single tune (because you can listen every single tune thanks to the great DTS or Dolby 5.1) I heard in the concert has been one wonderful experience.<br />I have all the songs in the CD from previous recordings/concerts,but is still worth having a different (even though slightly in some cases) version because everytime EC changes something, he does for good.<br />Layla's ending is just beautiful as it is the whole thing!!! The band is great and EC himself needs to do nothing but play and sing. No fancy lights, no fancy clothing, no fancy dancers, no fancy nothing... just plain and pure Clapton at his very best (just like the best wines).<br />After watching the DVD (several times already), one thing you start to notice is how EC manages the secuence of songs, taking your mood from a very quite beginning, then going very melancolic (between tears in heaven and My fahters eye) and then bringing you back with cocaine all the way to the end where your heart rate goes back to normal with Over the rainbow.<br />Thanks God for this CD/DVD (aka EC)
B00005JL78|5.0|When I first saw \\"Blade Runner,\\" I hated it.  I was so disgusted that people called it a 'film-noir' implying that is was REALLY DEEP.  OK, \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" THAT's film-noir.  \\"Blade Runner\\" was just some stupid cop drama set in the future filmed with a dark lens.  I hated it a bunch, basically.  But I saw it on a sunday, and when I went back to school on monday, we started watching it in my futures class!  So i've now seen it twice, and hated it both times.  I digress.<br />So based on this I assumed I would hate \\"Minority Report,\\" which was also originally written by Philip K. Dick.  I was, as the title here suggests, happily surprised.  \\"Minority Report\\" is much better than \\"Blade Runner\\".  It instead takes a more relaxed attitude toward itself.  While \\"Blade Runner\\" tried SO HARD and failed (in my eyes) SO MISERABLY, \\"Minority Report\\" succeded because it doesn't take itself so seriously.  Brief moments of humor are blended well with drug addiction, domestic violence, some REALLY SWEET action, and of course the whodoneit mystery.  In short, if you're like me, in the minority hating \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Minority Report\\" might suit you better.<br />That last part sorta rhymed.  Nifty!
6305622914|5.0|I don't want to repeat what other reveiwers have said, but this film is HILAIRIOUS. <br />The actors are perfect for their roles, and it manages to do what other brit flick films haven't - realism without being so depressing they serve prozac outside the cinema.<br />Also, THE CHARECTERS HAVE REAL ACCENTS!<br />Trust me; you will find no Dick Van Dykes or Helen Baxendale accents in this film.Coming from Wigan, in Northern England myself it gets SO annoying when all Brits in movie are so BLOODY POSH!<br />Like i've said; the film is hilairious. But their are times when it chokes you up, particularily the scenes with Gazes son.  Robert Carlisle has such stage presance you really feel the emotions, but the gags start again within seconds. <br />Everyone should buy this film, it's such a boredom breaker when it's raining and it cheers me up every time. <br />so ta for readin ive got fot go fot eat sum pies, see ya!
B000021YQV|5.0|Previously, in another review, I rated this album three stars. It was a HUGE mistake!! This album makes you shout, cry, laugh, and sing along. The songs are quite possibly the best songs ever created on a rock/heavy metal album, with outstanding lyrics and jaw-dropping sound. This band took a dare and created an effect never heard before in music. Obviously, it was no mistake doing so! The sound is agressive, mixed with beauty and softer elements. Combined, it is eerily otherworldly good! Upon the first couple of listens to the music, you'll probably dislike the album somewhat. Give it time, and eventually, you'll see just why the album is so wonderful! People can only dream of creating music this good. Toxicity is also far above and beyond System of a Down and Steal This Album! No rock album can beat this! You can all kiss Aerosmith, KISS, and Rage Against the Machine goodbye! Hail to the new heavy metal kings! Song highlights include Chop Suey!, Toxicity, Aerials, and Deer Dance. You can't go wrong here! Buy this album, even if you prefer listening to Justin Timberlake and Backstreet Boys. This will make them look like teddy bears to hug at night! Bottom Line-DON'T EVER MISS OUT ON SOMETHING THIS INCREDIBLY TERRIFIC!
B00006BTCA|3.0|Let me start by stating that I hate, I mean hate, THE White Stripes, THE Strokes, THE Hives, THE Vines...all THE bands with color corrodinated outfits who rip off bands that they couldn't hold a candle to...and now we have Interpol...without the THE, but with the suits.  And in many ways that describes thier sound.  They rip off many superior bands like Joy Division (yes, that is the best comparison, regardless of what a few others say), Bowie, and Echo and the Bunnyman.  But the best way to describe their sound is a direct rip off of a much underlooked and superior band - Silkworm, from the mid 90's...the thing that seperates them though is that while Silkworm produced some excellent original music and certainly some of the most emotionally loud and powerful music of that decade (Nirvana included), Interpol is again a pale comparison, not producing anything of serious impact or originality.  But, I recommend this release regardless.<br />The reason?  For fans of the aformentioned bands this is a welcome release.  We may not have Joy Division or Echo anymore, or even the previously excellent stage of Silkworm, but we can all have a couple of shots of vodka (this is british influenced post punk after all) and remember that particular time of rock's glory days.  <br />As a result this release comes with many conditions...rock is as dead as a doornail, as evidenced by the last two years releases...yet something like this will hopefully force current fans to retrace its glory and maybe Interpol will give them a partial road map, and for those of us who have already been there, it is a nice flare in the night sky.  Check it out...and hope that rock rises again in a manner that matters.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is, to this day, one of the most unique films ever done. From its voiceover narrative by a dead man (Holden) seen floating face-down in a swimming pool in the opening sequence, to its singular performance by Swanson (a woman who could, on film, convince a viewer that up was down), director Wilder was at peak form in this production. There is an essential truth to the script that holds even today: that an actress, at fifty, is finished, done, futureless.<br />Everything about this film works--from the darkly shadowed lighting of interior scenes to the secondary performances (particularly director Erich von Stroheim as Swanson's butler) to the mind-sets of all the characters depicted. Swanson is scarily good as the former silent-film star, for which she got a best-actress academy award nomination. (She should have won but the award went to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday--a good performance but not better than Swanson's. But rarely do the truly deserving actors or films get the nods they should from the academy.) This is one of the films that actually deserved its awards for story and screenplay. If it had appeared in, say, 1951, no doubt it would have taken the best picture award. But coming up against All About Eve, there was no contest. It was a great year for movies.<br />If you've never seen Sunset Boulevard, it's not to be missed. If you have seen it, but not for a while, see it again. It's a classic, in every way.<BR>My highest recommendation.
B0000640VO|4.0|This movie is a good movie in its own way. Shows the life of Amelie and how she tries to help others when she should try to fix her own life first. Funny movie but some inappropriate parts about sex and orgasms.
B00005JLRR|3.0|I'm a pretty big Star Trek fan going back to the original series and all subsequent TV series and movies.  The way the movies have gone, there are some strong ones like \\"Wrath of Kahn\\" and some weak ones like the one Shatner directed.  Nemesis is one of the weaker ones, certainly the lesser of the Next Generation movies.  There are some real swell special effects, and some fun scenes, but also some fairly major flaws.<br />The scene where Picard and Data escape from the enemy ship is great (to describe it would give away part of the story).  The space battle scenes are relatively cool -- although perhaps too much shield status reporting.  (\\"The dorsal shield is at 30 percent!\\"  \\"The starboard shield is down to ten percent!\\" et al)  The threat to the Earth is never fully explained -- exactly why does the villain want to destroy the Earth?  And the villain himself is poorly developed -- his relationship to Picard never really feels right.<br />I'm definitely glad I saw this film, but it never really \\"engaged\\" me.
B00000IBRX|5.0|I like the way Robin Williams' jaw moves from side to side when he gets emotional. I like the way Robin Williams' facial expressions show over-the-top feeling throughout. <br />In this movie, Robin Williams becomes a caricature of an over-emotional Robin Williams. The music is fitting too. When the orchestra climaxes as Robin Williams runs into the arms of his daughter in slow motion in Heaven, it makes the viewer stop and think, \\"I can't believe this over-the-top Hollywood fantasy-flick is making me feel so ... emotional!\\"<br />But I think this movie is more aligned with ultimate Truth than we might know. God bless Robin Williams and his over-the-top emotional jaw action.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I have to admit that I enjoy listening to this CD.  But at the same time, I've been a Dave fan for over 12 years, and sometimes it seems like Mayer is trying a little too hard to be the next Dave Matthews (and Mayer's band is nowhere NEAR the caliber of Matthews').  A few of the songs on this alblum ARE really catchy and well-written, while some are a little bland.  So if Dave is somebody you like, and you want to purchase something a little different and more... relaxing is the nice way to put it, this CD is a good choice.  But otherwise, buy a classic Dave CD.  He's the real deal.
B000005J56|5.0|Had a good friend not sent me a copied disc, I'd probably have never purchased this album. I knew about it and the movie, but figured it was Ry Cooder infatuated with a mariachi band. Wrong. This is absolutely gorgeous music, a true fusion of jazz, blues and latin styles played by unknown masters. It  cooks, it grooves, it will make you fall in love with good music and the wonder of virtuousity all over again. I purchased a new copy out of respect for the artists and for the 48-page booklet that doesn't come with bootlegs.
B00005JL2O|2.0|I was not very happy with the DVD.  I was unable to pause, fast forward, rewind, etc.  The makers of the DVD clearly did not do their job when it came to code for all types of machines.  I felt the makers of the movie did a big injustace because of the bleeps and images they fuzzed out to give the movie a PG-13 rating.  If the makers wanted to make a PG-13 movie, they should have filmed it properly.
B00000099Y|5.0|tool are the kind of band that you eigther love or hate. unfortunately all those people who hate tool are straight up giving this album 1 star based on their disliking of the band, and not on the quality of this particular album. therefore,  i am going to give it 5 stars to counteract this :)<br />anyways its a great album, which is probably why 700+ people have reviewed it (most giving it 4 or 5 stars).
B0000024K1|5.0|such a powerful album that struck fear in white america,and alienated some conservative blacks.one of the best albums i ever own.and its indeed essential to any hip hop collection.
B00000099Y|5.0|tis very sad to see that michael ellis has nothing better to do with his time/life then write anti-tool reviews to prove that he really, really, really hates tool (psst buddy... umm we gont care!). anyways this is just another review to raise the rating when stiffs give it 1 star.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This album really shows Britney stretching out.  The songs are entirely different from her earlier albums, and I think you can really detect the difficult life she leads and the inner turmoil she feels in a lot of the touching songs.<br />Really an amazing album.  The cover clearly indicated that this was not to be confused with her other albums.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album found in hip-hop today. This is also the LP that inspired me to be a rapper. Some of the hardest and best metaphors can be found on this one CD. (I developed my style from this LP.) What I like about this CD is that every member of Wu has his well-deserved shine. All of these songs can be considered calssics. Wu-Tang has always been my favorite group. A group that has Method Man, GZA, RZA, Inspectah Deck &amp; Ghostface Killah must be the greatest of all-time. A group that has these 5 lyricists AND produces hit after hit; hot album after hot album is definitly somewhat sacred. The top songs on this cut are C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Can It All Be So Simple, Protect Ya Neck &amp; Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin Ta [Mess] Wit. If you don't have this LP, then your life just isnt complete. Below is my track rating (1-5):<br />Track 1 - 5 <BR>Track 2 - 4.5<BR>Track 3 - 5<BR>Track 4 - 4.5<BR>Track 5 - 5<BR>Track 6 - 5<BR>Track 7 - 5<BR>Track 8 - 5+++<BR>Track 9 - 5+++<BR>Track 10 - 5+++<br />Track 11 - 5<BR>Track 12 - 4.5
B00005JLRR|1.0|If you are thinking of going to the movie - DONT!!! <br />Who am I? I'm a 26 y.o. trek geek girl...Not totally hardcore... I don't have any schematics on my wall and I haven't been inspired to collect any action figures (yet ;) But, the Star Trek Universe is a very MAJOR part of my life so I take it seriously when \\"they\\" start messing around with this Universe in substantial ways.<br />This movie could not decide what it wanted to be. The pacing was awkward and choppy, the dialogue vaccuous, and the Romulans weren't much more than a marginalized plot device - the big scarey arch enemy is a human clone! <br />Arghhh!<br />There is SO MUCH to hate about this movie. But, I will cut to the chase and tell you the No. 1 reason to avoid it like the plague:<br />--------Spoilers Ahead--------<BR>--------Spoilers Ahead--------<BR>--------Spoilers Ahead--------<br />Data is killed. Dead. Gone. Vaporized. No way to retrieve him miraculously at the last second. This is the denouement of all weakly plotted stories - Kill Someone Important to Make it Exciting. Don't get me wrong - I understand that people die. Good people. It happens in life (my sister is dead). But to kill a powerful and loved character simply because they couldn't think of anything else to make the story climactic? Feeble. Flaccid. Impuissant.<br />And WHY does Data die? Because the Courageous Captain Picard who has faced down the Borg, Q, the Crystaline Entity, Lore, etc. etc. has suddenly became pusillanimous. With his bare hands, He can rip a data chip out of a borg drone that used to be one of his crew, but he suddenly turns into an indecisive, dottering old fool when he faces his \\"big scarey-warey clone\\"? <br />That's another thing, the philosophical pretentions in this movie were rather unbearable. Every last cultural fear of cloning was pandered to. Oh, and did I mention that Picard, Riker, and Worf are all througly emasculated in this movie? <br />I could go on and on with what I hated about this movie:the Remans - how many times are they going to make alien makeup a variation on the same theme? Shinzon's costume was strictly 80's rehash. The long-awaited wedding sequence was non-existant - instead we get a long-winded speech by Picard at the reception, Data does Irving Berlin, Worf has a hangover and whines about it in a most unwarriorly fashion (you'd think with all the Blood Wine he has downed, he could hold his liquour a little better), Guynan makes a weak quip, and latter on we get a totally unflattering sexual moment between Riker and Deanna during which she is mind-raped by Shinzon and his Viceroy. So it's not bad enough that we get the second major plot device of all weak stories - Kill a Loved Character, but we also get the Biggest, the suggestion of violent and forcible sex.<br />As if all that isn't bad enough, the writer's expect us to find consolation in the fact that Data isn't really gone. His reset button has just been hit. Capt. Picard isnt the only one facing a clone in this story. Data also has a dopleganger! Yippie... and gosh, he can't help it if he doesn't have enough positronic connections to become a real Boy! \\"But look! He has potential!\\"<br />And lest I forget, what was with the desert dune buggy nonesense a'la Mad Max and Steel Dawn?<br />Anyway, I clearly have degenerated into pure ranting at this point. I shall update this review when I feel more cogent. Suffice to say, the movie is Weak weak weak weak weak WEAK! A total travesty and a complete waste of film..<br />*****<br />Okay, teenie confession, the Scimitar WAS cool. BUT, we never even get to see it's Thaeleron (sp?) Radiation weapon used. How anticlimactic!<br />ARGHHHH!!...<br />Bottom Line, this film does NOT exist in my trek cannon - officially sanctioned or not.  What a disappointing approximation of a real TNG movie!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I've bought this CD because I liked RATM and also Soundgarden. I was really surprised about this sound. It sounds so really good, perfect voice, best guitar, a cool bass and nice drums. In the Moment I don't listen to other CD's. It's the one and only...
B00006BTCA|5.0|simply put, few bands are willing to try what interpol has done on this, their debut album, and even fewer are able to pull it off so boldly, so pleasingly.  despite the heaping praises &quot;turn on the bright lights&quot; has received, its music still astounds, surpassing this listener's expectations.  it's easy to be skeptical about arty-rock bands, and there's no doubt interpol fits the mold a little too comfortably (they dress like waifish male models, after all).  but the 11 songs they chose to unleash on us are not dressed up in off-putting fashion trends.  from the get-go, with &quot;untitled&quot; (sigur ros must love this one) it is clear that they favor sonic density and an overload of guitar layers, albeit sonically clearer than anything my bloody valentine would do.  &quot;obstacle 1&quot; is the highlight of the show, with staccato, repetitive guitar lines stepping on each other's toes, in a nervy call and response manner that redefines catchy.  the dancey backbone somehow does not interfere with the loud guitar sounds or lyrics about &quot;stabbing yourself in the neck.&quot;  the gentle dronings of &quot;nyc&quot; present an understated romantic pause before the resumed franticness of &quot;pda&quot; and &quot;say hello to the angels,&quot; the latter of which updates the smiths' sound with some souped-up distortion and syncopated rhythms.  admittedly, with such an irresistible opening salvo, it is difficult to maintain quality, and &quot;hands away&quot; and &quot;obstacle 2&quot; sound suspiciouslly derivative of these previous songs.  fortunately, the record closes nearly as strongly as it started, with the somewhat overlong, but gorgeous &quot;stella was a diver,&quot; and the last few tracks.  &quot;roland&quot; explodes with searing guitar lines, reminiscent of &quot;obstacle 1&quot; and highly processed vocals that lend a bleaker tone to the song.  &quot;the new&quot; might be interpol's best song lyrically, perfectly capturing the band's gloom and doom outlook, without forgetting to allow some solitary moments of beauty to shine through, illustrating the essence of transcending pain and suffering.  this is not your typical &quot;glimmer of hope&quot; - its nature is different, in that interpol acknowledge that the world is forever imperfect and harrowing in the pain it causes for so many people, yet they are keenly aware that this is the only way to cope with it.  &quot;leif erikson&quot; is perhaps a little dissapointing in that it doesn't close the album with the bombast of earlier songs, but it does not deviate from the record's intended course.  few debut albums are this powerful, musically and poetically, and regardless of what they do with this later, &quot;turn on the bright lights&quot; will remain a treasure of a record.  one of the best intellectual records in recent memory.
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman just keeps getting better. Ironically, we have to look to an Englishman to write the best book on American culture in many years. What I like most about Neil Gaiman is his ability to incorporate fantasy and myth into his novels while retaining a feel that is intimate, and while creating characters that you come to deeply identify with and care for. No matter how far out his novels get, they remain deeply human, and that is an incredibly difficult task for a writer.
6304595247|4.0|Someone from Yorkshire, England wrote:  \\"[Fiennes] never really gets to grips with Heathcliff's complexities, and ends up looking just bad-tempered and greasy.\\"<br />RUBBISH.  Most people living during that time were bad-tempered and greasy. If you don't want to see some unrealistic, 1930's Hollywood melodrama of Bronte's novel, or some 70's or 80's film version that plays like a bad American soap opera or made for TV movie, then this version is worth viewing.  <br />Although short cited in some details, this is a well-cast, well-acted film.  Fiennes is haunted and realistic as Heathcliff, complex in his obsessions and oppressions.  Binoche is also good, although her minor role as Catherine is more touching and believable than that of Cathy.  Supporting roles by McTeer, Northam, and others are also praiseworthy.  My only regret is that the Catherine / Hereton / Linton Heathcliff storyline is not given more treatment (but at least a majority of it made it into this adaptation).  <br />As previously noted, Ryuichi Sakamoto's score is brilliant and haunting.  The score often elevates the film beyond the director's lack of style.<br />Overall, a sometimes lackluster film elevated by great performances.
6302298695|5.0|John Singleton's \\"Boyz N The Hood,\\" released in 1991, was such a profound film that its impact is still felt today!  This timeless drama was released in ONLY 829 theaters nationwide, and still generated nearly $60 million in box office receipts; the demand for this film was evident.<br />\\"Boyz N The Hood\\" centers around the lives of three African American males, illustrating a realistic view of everyday life in the gang infested streets of South Central, L.A., where I was born and raised.  One of the things that makes \\"Boyz N The Hood\\" stand out from other films is the message behind it, which is one that's so powerful it's guaranteed to touch you in one way or another.  Singleton shows how important it is to have a FATHER present in the home; he also shows how easily a life can be taken in the hood, where random killings -- due to gang-violence -- are still occurring today.  <br />Cuba Gooding Jr., Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long, and Morris Chestnut do an outstanding job in their roles, but Ice Cube, who had no prior acting experience, steals the show in this powerful film.  <br />\\"Boyz N The Hood\\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, and after seeing this film, you'll know why!
B000066NW0|5.0|Sick of the boring voices of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera? Well Avril Lavigne is the person to listen to. Her songs sound so much for realistic (she writes her own songs) with lyrics you're able to relate to. The songs sound a little rockish with a tiny tint of country (don't worry it's not strong at all). She has a pretty voice and I would definitly recommend this cd to those rockers and punk rockers out there.
B000065U1N|5.0|Simply one of the most underrated movies of 2001. Realistic and accurate account of the failed attempt to capture top aides of Aidid. And that's all I've got to say about that.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This is a must have DVD for you Journey Fans!<BR>My wife and I have watched this over and over, we were sceptical about buying this DVD because we thought without Steve Perry how good could this DVD be.<BR>Well let me tell you, if your a true Journey fan you'll love this DVD, Steve Augeri is incredible on vocals and Deen Castronovo is awesome on the drums and of course the founding members (Neal Schon, Ross Valory, and Johathan Cain) are better than ever.<BR>If you appreciate great music you won't be disappointed with this DVD.
6304359217|4.0|Space Jam teams up His Airness, Michael Jordan, with His Hareness, Bugs Bunny, for a fun, and funny, family film.<br />Michael Jordan has retired from basketball, and currently playing baseball, when Bugs Bunny and his Looney Tunes pals ask for his help in playing a b-ball game against diminuative aliens from Moron Mountain. These aliens have stolen the talent of 5 NBA players, including Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing, and are now larger than life. Since this is Looney Tunes Land, this game is NOT your average basketball game. If it was, it wouldn't be any fun.<br />Though not an actor of any kind in anyone's book, Michael Jordan does a very good job of interacting with his cartoon co-stars. Most of the jokes are well done and the basketball game itself is a lot of fun. In addition, it is quite funny to watch the 5 NBA players that had their \\"games\\" stolen trying to cope with their newfound ordinaryness.<br />This movie is not groundbreaking by any means and most all of the original Looney Tunes cartoons are better. But this movie never tries to be more than it is: a good time. And at that, it succeeds very well.
B00005QIPH|1.0|One of my best friends is an all out strokes fan and there a band that I really didnt listen to till they got bigger...but i was very dissapointed.  He told me about there amazing talent and all that good stuff, so I listened to it full of antisipation, only to be dissapointed to the 3rd degree.  Maybe it was an overload of bands such as THE vines THE strokes THE hives THE white stripes THE ataris....so many the's i feel like i dropped back 30 years into hell...maybe its just that i'm an all out sum 41 fan, unwritten law and of course SR-71!!just a different style but this was just dissapointing to hear it be claimed the future of rock n role...god have mercy
0739301985|4.0|This book is a nice fast read about the yearly insanity known as Christmas. The books subject matter and length should be enough to tell anyone to expect nothing that smacks of Grisham's thrillers. After sending their daughter off to Brazil The Krank's decide to go on a cruise instead of observe the yearly rituals and trouble ensues. As far as I was concerned there is no great insight here it's just a light deversion. I do not see it as a lesson on how to observe christmas or the making of a case for not observing it at all. Just a good book to spend a little time with.
0321127420|5.0|This book is the masterpiece. This book is full of sound advice, tips and traps. The patterns in this book they are very well identified, specified, clarified, and classified. Martin brings the patterns to life with just the right mixture of prose and code. <BR>He provides a lot of code samples. If you have really complex business logic, you will find how the patterns presented in this book are useful. <br />This book is useful for both J2EE and NET developers. This is particularly useful when attempting to gain an understanding of how application architectures differ between .NET and J2EE. <br />Domain logic patterns described in this book are very interesting, they help you to map domain logic to a design; Data source architectural patterns can be considered as extension of entity bean and DAO; object-relational structural patterns can help you to map object to table design; there are other interesting patterns as Unit of Work (in Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns) and Query Object (in Object-Relational Metadata Mapping Patterns). In a whole, you see all of the basic patterns of object-relational mapping in this book.<br />This book also presents some interesting presentation patterns, besides those presented in Core J2EE patterns, you can find Application Controller, Transform View, Two Step Views patterns very useful also.<br />There are others very useful concurrency patterns, session state patterns, distribution patterns presented in the book, and you can find some \\"Base Patterns\\", which can be considered \\"classical\\" patterns.<br />Martin has successfully shown how to use patterns to link together all of the parts of an enterprise system.<br />Just as Design Patterns did seven years ago, this book will become the basis of a vocabulary that we will use from now on to speak about information system's architecture. This book will be a handbook of many developers.
1583762027|4.0|\\"Eat That Frog!\\" is a quick read and a thought provoking book.  The author, Brian Tracey, could probably have combined a few of the topics that are similar, but even without further distillation it is an interesting read.<br />The basic message of the book is really decide what matters, pick the most important activities, figure out the steps to get results and start doing it now.<br />Having summed it up in one sentence you main wonder if you need this book.  I would say if you want to accomplish the most with what limited resources you have then this is worth the money.  Each chapter includes short exercises that make you focus on what you really want and help you build an action plan to get it done.
B00006LFGD|4.0|Superb compilation for many reasons, but THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT REASON?  It includes the underrated, classic \\"Make No Mistake, He's Mine\\" which was written by Kim Carnes and sung by both of these wonderful talents.  Just the mere listen of two completely different voices is sheer heaven.  Kim's throaty vocals at times overpower Barbra's, but the sound is crisp, clean, and the ballad is superb!  A true classic, and hard to find on cd.  The other duets are great too...
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The best album of the 1980's from the only band that matters.
B00004R99R|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Disney animation for years. While I may not like many of the features, I can see why they are popular. This movie, however, stinks. Even though it has this Jazz groove going on (and I am a HUGE jazz music fan), I found it trite and dull musically, and in fact quite annoying at many times. This also has a &quot;new wave&quot; animation style that really is distracting as well. I think Pokemon has better animation style than this movie (I can't believe I can actually say that!).<br />And the story! Well, if you hoped it stuck to the original, forget it. It's a total rewrite of the legend.<br />I'll give credit where credit is due. It's still better than Barney.
B000002UA0|5.0|I once read an article that split Pink Floyd's fanbase into \\"The Hippies\\" (those whose interest lies from the \\"Meddle\\" & \\"Dark Side\\" era until \\"The Wall\\") and \\"The Hipsters\\" (those--like David Bowie--who feel that PF never achieved the greatness they reached with Syd Barrett).  As in most situations, the truth lies somewhere in between.<br />It's been said often enough that the summer of 1967 was \\"The Summer of Love\\" (unless you were black and lived in the American inner city).  What's interesting about \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is that Pink Floyd never panders to the Flower Power market.  This is primarily due to Syd Barrett's whimsical, child-like tales of fancy and it is telling that this CD's title is taken from the children's novel \\"The Wind in the Willows\\".  The result is a truly original work of music that stands up very well considering all the social, political and musical changes since its release.<br />This album flows very well, dominated by Barrett's light, upbeat, and distinctively English psychedelic pop songs in the first four and last four tracks.  It's balanced in between with two \\"freak-out\\" musical interludes (especially the outstanding \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\") as well as a Roger Waters song (\\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\") that illustrates how different his source of musical inspiration was from Barrett's. <br />Those expecting \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" should be reminded that \\"Piper\\" is more like \\"Revolver\\"-era Beatles than 1970's Pink Floyd.  Syd Barrett was a very different songwriter than Roger Waters and what you have here is a very different band.  \\"Piper\\" is certainly Pink Floyd's most uplifting recording and should be appreciated for the group's musical skill and Barrett's enormous songwriting talent--which was sadly lost as his mental health declined as his drug use escalated.<br />I would rank \\"Piper\\" as a close second to their 1975 Barrett tribute \\"Wish You Were Here\\" for being the best Pink Floyd album.  Both \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"The Wall\\" are a little played-out in my opinion.<br />I also would recommend \\"Piper\\" to any music fan, especially any serious Pink Floyd aficionado who wants to understand what all the fuss about Syd Barrett is and why years later he continued to \\"shine on\\" in his former bandmates' music.
B0000025LS|5.0|This cd is 3 time purchase for me. I first bought on 8 track in 1981 when it first came out and then on cassette a few years later and now just recently on cd. Carlos' guitar work is top notch as always on this cd as well as the great vocals of Alex Litgerwood. I think the rockin' songs SEARCHING and OVER AND OVER are better than the 2 hit singles off this cd WINNING and SENSITIVE KIND. LOVE YOU MUCH TOO MUCH is the best instrumental on the cd with some very intense moving guitar solos. The track THE BRIGHTEST STAR is well worth a listen with a blues rock style with blistering guitar solos by Carlos and a great vocal performance by Alex Litgerwood. I also love the excellent guitar work on HANNIBAL which is the last track on the cd;Carlos really gets jammin' on this song.
0316666343|5.0|On her way home from school on a snowy December day in 1973, 14-year-old Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\") is lured into a makeshift underground den in a cornfield and brutally raped and murdered, the latest victim of a serial killer--the man she knew as her neighbor, Mr. Harvey. <br />Alice Sebold's haunting and heartbreaking debut novel, The Lovely Bones, unfolds from heaven, where \\"life is a perpetual yesterday\\" and where Susie narrates and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends, as well as her brazen killer and the sad detective working on her case. As Sebold fashions it, everyone has his or her own version of heaven. Susie's resembles the athletic fields and landscape of a suburban high school: a heaven of her \\"simplest dreams,\\" where \\"there were no teachers.... We never had to go inside except for art class.... The boys did not pinch our backsides or tell us we smelled; our textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue.\\" <br />The Lovely Bones works as an odd yet affecting coming-of-age story. Susie struggles to accept her death while still clinging to the lost world of the living, following her family's dramas over the years like an episode of My So-Called Afterlife. Her family disintegrates in their grief: her father becomes determined to find her killer, her mother withdraws, her little brother Buckley attempts to make sense of the new hole in his family, and her younger sister Lindsey moves through the milestone events of her teenage and young adult years with Susie riding spiritual shotgun. Random acts and missed opportunities run throughout the book--Susie recalls her sole kiss with a boy on Earth as \\"like an accident--a beautiful gasoline rainbow.\\" Though sentimental at times, The Lovely Bones is a moving exploration of loss and mourning that ultimately puts its faith in the living and that is made even more powerful by a cast of convincing characters. Sebold orchestrates a big finish, and though things tend to wrap up a little too well for everyone in the end, one can only imagine (or hope) that heaven is indeed a place filled with such happy endings.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Sounds like Soundgarden with a dash of Rage against the Machine thrown in. Man, Chris Cornell has WAY TOO MUCH influence over this band! Nothing new here. If you like Soundgarden, you might dig this one. If you like RATM stick with them as you might not like this new group. CD overall is average at best.
B000070IXT|1.0|This is a zombie movie?  More like the people watching it are zombies themselves if they can actually swallow this as horror.<br />Here's a clue:  DAWN OF THE DEAD is a zombie movie.  This is a corporate franchise pick that gives MILLA JOVOVICH a chance to wear next to nothing.  This movie is idiotic, not nearly as good as the game in anyway, boring, cheesy, has bad special effects, and is overall fairly goreless.  This is NOT A ZOMBIE movie.  This is like LUNCHABLES the movie.  It's prepacked and look's pretty good until you actually eat it, or in this case watch it.<br />The only reason to watch this loser is if your a Milla Jovovich fan.  And she may have a nice body, but she is about as dimensional as a sheet of paper as an actress.  And everyone knows she wouldn't have a career if what's his name hadn't been doing her and putting her in all his movies.<br />So basically this film is okay on the T&A factor, but negative on the gore factor.  This is just not very good at all.<br />Of course if your a 15-40 year old who can't ever get a date because you lack the neccessary social skills and are too embarrased to actually buy porn then perhaps this idiotic film might tickle your fancy.  Lusting after these empty screen goddesses is not a terribly productive pastime but if you are 30 and still getting turned on by the cartoon drawings in HEAVY METAL magazine then this is for you.<br />I mean just go to a sci-fi convention.  See the 400 pound men talking about how hot Milla is and what they would do to her.  It is all just very sad and pathetic and this movie in all its pathetic glory is truly for pathetic people.<br />So guys, put on another 100 pounds, sit in front of the tube and dream that one day you might get the girl.  Sorry.<br />THIS MOVIE IS AS CLOSE AS YOU'LL EVER GET!!!
B000001FNL|5.0|It's pleasure & pain..it's a gravy train..it's a wonderland..it's a ride....& it's alright. It's REALLY FINE!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I never expected this! I was certain that this was going to be another trip into the world of POP music, but no way. Instead this album surrounds itself with high quality R&B, blues and a bit of rock music that really makes you just melt away. Some of my favorites include \\"Fighter\\" \\"Infatuation\\" \\"Loving Me 4Me\\" and \\"Impossible\\", just to name a few, certainly there is no filler on this album. Yes I'm a big fan of Britney Spears, but I know for sure she could not handle not one of these songs that Christina blast in your ear. May be \\"Make Over\\". Two more favorites Cruz & Soar are two other excellent examples of great music that reflects a artiste who has paid great attention to her art and not the money that's gonna be made from it. She gives you your money's worth, out of all the albums I have purchased this year, I consider this to be the best. The merging of the instruments with Christina's voice is just flawless. I recommend you buy this album, its really superb. The three years was worth the wait, this was not a hurry out the door album. Fully influenced mostly by Rock, R&B, Blues, Latin, hip-hop this album certainly meets everyones expectation. When you listen to the music, it seems as if Christina decided to listen some of the foundations of the past and it really paid off. A bit of everything for every music lover. (**********) 10 stars! If it takes three years to make such a great album, imagine the next one, I'll wait!
B00005JLRR|5.0|This movie is the best...of all of them!  The plot is great, the special effects are awesome, and the suspense is thrilling!  This movie was extraordinary, definitely something to see!  The plot development is smooth, which makes it a completely enjoyable film! If you liked any of the other star trek movies, you'll absolute love this one, plus you'll never know what will happen ;-)
B000002HPV|5.0|I am a brand-new Bjork fan. The first album I bought was Greatest Hits and now I am working on getting all the others. I got Homogenic just yesterday, and already I can't stop listening to it! This album is AMAZING, i LOVE it! Not a sinlge throw-away song on here. The marriage of techno and orchestration Bjork creates is absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to hear Post!
0060005424|5.0|I've read this book, and Sabriel twice a year, since I was 11. The first time I read Lirael, I locked myself in my room, and read the entire book in 6 hours. I couldn't put it down!!! The plots addictive, and you realy feel like you're part of the story, and that you're in The Old Kingdom. Even though it's fiction, it doesn't read like it. It's so smoth, and has no holes. I would recomend it to anyone, and await the release of Abhorsen!!!
B00003CX9S|5.0|Amazing film! I have always had a hard time watching classics and actually liking them mostly because they're way before my time and I don't think I can appreciate them for what they really are. However,The Elephant Man was a slap in the face of pure greatness courtesy of David Lynch.<BR>A mezmorizing film that everyone should see in their lifetime.
0451207521|4.0|Another great novel by Ken Follett.  This one ranks up there with his earlier better novels.  Set during WWII, you can appreciate how the actions of a few can change the war for so many.  Maybe a little unbelieveable at times, but very enjoyable.
B000002BFZ|4.0|&quot;No Code&quot; has been reviled by many people, but when I picked the album up and listened, I found that many of the bad comments I had read were unfounded. &quot;All a bunch of filler&quot; said one review-well, let me tell you, this album is anything BUT filler. Every song is another experimental soundscape that transports you to a different part in the Pearl Jam universe. Definitely Pearl Jam's most difficult and far-reaching record, &quot;No Code&quot; is one of the most rewarding albums to have in your collection because it takes some effort, and many listens, to appreciate its full power. A few standouts: &quot;Sometimes&quot; is a daring low-key number with a trancendental side where singer Eddie Vedder bravely lets his voice go slightly out of key numerous times. &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; and &quot;Habit&quot; are classic rockers that will have you swaying and head-bobbing. &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; has a definite Niel Young sound to it, &quot;In My Tree&quot; and &quot;Off He Goes&quot; are beautiful slower numbers. One of my favorites is &quot;Mankind&quot;, which is sung by Stone Gossard and is the single most accessible and poppy tune on this album and probably the most pop-inflected thing Pearl Jam has ever done. This song just adds to the album's aura of challenge because it comes between the dirge-like &quot;Present Tense&quot; and the free-verse experiment of &quot;I'm Open&quot;. All in all, &quot;No Code&quot; might not be Pearl Jam's best album (I'm convinced that that place will always be reserved for all eternity by the brilliant power of &quot;Ten&quot;), but it is probably their most rewarding. If you have only room in your collection for a few Pearl Jam records, make sure &quot;No Code&quot; is one of them.
B00003CX5P|4.0|awesome pix,awesome sound, lots of fun if you are a fan.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Have you ever noticed that all the other romantic fairy-tales always involve a dashingly handsome prince and a beautiful young princess falling madly in love at first sight and then living happily ever after (at least as portrayed by Hollywood)? I mean, how shallow must their knowledge and understanding of each other be! And love? Not to say there is no such thing as love at first sight, but marriage -- a life-time commitement after one kiss (in the case of Snow White)? And do we even know they are good people? Could it be possible that Cinderella would marry the prince just to escape her torturous life from the step-mother and step-sisters? And what do we know about the Prince Charming who revived Snow White with a kiss? Beauty and the Beast is probably as far as Hollywood had ever departed from the beauty and prince rule, but wait -- Beast is *really* a prince! How wonderful! And good for Beauty! Bottom line? It's not only unrealistic, but also devoid of any valueable lesson or even advisable message for today's kids and teenagers.<br />Enter Shrek! A totally unattractive, unorthodox, irreverent, a bit scary, but humorous creature who lives not in a castle but a swamp, who has no white horse, but an uninvited annoying donkey as his sidekick. The initial impression of Shrek isn't pretty, but we know he has a thousand times more personality than a poster prince whose character seems to be defined by his props. He may not come off immediately as like-able, but at least we see an individual, full of life, with his own thoughts and emotions.<br />By now you should know the plot already, which I won't repeat. It is to Shrek's creaters' credit that we automatically want to say, \\"Wait a minute: this is all wrong! *Lord Faaqua* should be the one rescuing Princess Fiona, not *Shrek*!\\" What a great setup! Part of the movie's attraction is how it deviates from the cliches of the traditional romantic fairy-tale. As the movie progresses, we become aware of our own prejudice with the realization that Shrek, just like Princess Fiona, is not what we perceived him to be in the first place. In the romance that ensues between the two, we see the wonder of love in the characters: true emotions; from joy, hesitation, to the attempt to resist love, to even fear. We see that love in fairy-tales can also happen between an average-looking princess who burps knows kung-fu and an ogre with bad manners but a soft heart, and that fairy-tale creatures do not have to be either absolutely perfect or pure evil -- much like the real world, actually. And we learn this in a movie that is didactic without being preachy or boring, but fun and hilarious!<br />Honestly, can you think of another fairy-tale movie that is as inspired, three-dimensional, heart-warming, entertaining, and morally conscious all at the same time? Then what are you waiting for? Grab your copy of the Shrek right now! Enjoy! :)
B00000J7L8|5.0|This album was so massive when it came out. The Hurting introduced American kids like me to the world of well crafted and performed &quot;Brit New Wave&quot; like I had never experienced. True, we already had been exposed to the likes of The Vapors, Split Enz, The Cars, The Motels, Missing Persons and other &quot;before their time&quot; artists which I failed to truly appreciate until recently. However, nothing on the airwaves seemed to quite encapsulate the sound of the early 80s British Pop as much as TFF did. This led to a landslide of bands such as Duran Duran, The Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds, The Thompson Twins and others that opened a musical portal in my head that I still long for to this day. <br />Todays world of &quot;rock/rap&quot; artists like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park just doesnt seem to hit that chord with me like the music of the early days of MTV.. I miss it so much. True, I am now in my late 30s, but I still can appreciate good music. And TFF was good music squared.<br />This band had a long string of success even into the mid 90s, but never really reached the dizzying heights that were hit during the &quot;Songs From The Big Chair&quot; era. The Hurting was but a warning of what was to come from the boys from Bath, England. Some of the greatest songs ever penned.
B000002H97|5.0|Anyone who says this album is where Metallica sold out is wrong. It's not a sell out, it's great, heavy music. And don't think I don't like thrash metal...I love it, but this album, and it's lyrics has something more to offer than just speed and aggression. And by the way, I don't remember Metallica ever telling you \\"fans\\" they would always play thrash metal. So don't feel all hurt and betrayed because Metallica didn't play exactly how you wanted them to on this one, that would mean you're weak. I'm not saying you have to like it either, I guess it's not some peoples style....(although you're still equally as ... for not liking such good music....). I have a feeling most of these guys saying how Metallica sold out are really young (like 13-16). A true metalhead will appreciate this type of hard rock/metal.<br />As for the music itself, well I won't bore you with my reviewing style. I'm sure you've all heard most of these songs...that's why reviewing this is pointless.
B000021YQV|4.0|Oh my lord! You people underrate these guys so bad it sad. First off, Serj doesn't try to sound like Maynard. He has one of the ost unique voices in metal right now. And if you seriously think that Zach De La Rocha has such \\"superb\\" talent, you're on drugs. These guys take metal to a new level. I think that you guys just can't handle it, 'cause it's like nothing you've ever heard before. All the songs on this album, especially \\"ATWA\\" show extreme talent, and good messages. The song tells you that Charles Manson wasn't a big \\"evil\\" guy or whatever people think of him as. He just told some people to kill someone, and they were stupid enough to do it...Well, I'm getting off subject. ...
0800130189|3.0|This was a pretty good movie with some strong yet cynical points about the world. Robert De Niro (my hero of actors), in one of his early roles, plays Travis Bickle, the taxi driver who grows depressed with the world around him. He sees violence and evil in people, and when he sets out to save a young prostitute, he uses violence and takes the law into his own hands. The controversy at the end is whether or not he is a hero for saving the prostitue from her pimp, or if he's a bad man for using violence to solve the problem. Now, I liked this film. I was expecting a little more though. Some things really were misleading, kind of confusing, and at times, a little bit boring. The story was dark, and some scenes seemed to have no meaning to them. But, all in all the movie isn't that bad. I don't see why it is deemed a classic though. It's not all that great. I read another review that suggested seeing it more than once in order to understand it. Maybe that's what I need to do, watch the movie again and maybe I'll enjoy it more. I enjoyed the memorable scene in which Robert De Niro utters the ever popular quote \\"Are you talkin' to me?\\" and aims a gun at the mirror. I also think it's a cool part when De Niro puts his hand over a flame. I recommend this movie for those who are interested in the early days of De Niro's career, and for those who want to see a cynical portrayal of the world through the eyes of a demented man.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This was a great Cd. The mix of Grunge with the indepth sound that rage but together in there earlier records. This is a great Cd but with one problem... More Rage guitar. In this Cd there was not enough guitar that rage allways put together. That was what i was looking for when I got this Cd.
0790736314|1.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" scared me so mucht that it was hard to sleep at night. The movie was too scary to be enjoyable. It is fun to watch movies that are scary, but have some comical or entertaining moments. This movie was just plain horrific violence. What was the point of this film? To prove that devils can get inside peoples' bodies and turn them into evil, dispicable, deplorable, and gory half human half demon beings? I'm a Catholic, and I have read in the Bible that this has happened. But, what is the point of watching this movie, just to make you sleepless at night and worrying if the devil will enter your body? I didn't watch the whole film. Maybe there was something in there that explained more detail about it. If so, then I apologize for being so critical of the movie. But if not, I say stick with films that are scary, but still have meaning, like \\"Cape Fear\\" or \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" or \\"Misery\\". Or, if you're a horror fan, stick with \\"The Shining\\".
B000001IQH|4.0|Overall this is a pretty solid album and is probably the best Rancid album out there. While it isn't 100% punk and does include ska and the like, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad album because they didn't conform to only one genre. The only flaw that I find with this album is that it fails to prove the common stereotype that all punk guitar music is the easiest thing in the world to play like some other rancid albums do. However, when you simply look at it for what it is, punk, it proves to be an almost perfect, at times thought provoking album.
B000000H5K|4.0|Sep showed a new direction with this release, weather that be a good one or not everyone has their opinion. while albums like arise and chaos a.d. are amazing thrash metal albums, some of the best ever, roots is more of a slow paced hard hitting kick your .. style. i have great respect for sepultura and max, i recomend this album to anyone.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Disoriented by sleeplessness and troubled by an Internal Affairs investigation that may destroy him, LA detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) becomes involved with a murder investigation in a small Alaskan town and the machinations of a killer (Robin Williams).  Directed by Christopher Nolan, who also made the excellent \\"Memento\\", this remake of a Norwegian thriller is much more than a pale rehash of a superior film, like most Hollywood remakes of foreign movies.  Instead, it is a worthy reexamination of the source material.  Many of the changes are typically American--the ambiguities in character motivation are removed and the ending is far more moralistic--yet I found it to be the equal of the original.  Nolan preserves the sense of  disorientation from the first film, and the interaction between cop and killer is intensified and deepened.  Recommended.
B00005ATQD|3.0|Tom Cruise has been a favorite of mine since Risky Business, and Nicole Kidman is one of those actresses that comes off classy, intelligent, and still radiates sex.  Kubric was a master who created some of my favorite films of all time.  And sex - who does not like sex - with a nice touch of kink.  But by the end of this movie I just felt sort of let down.  It was the celluloid equivalent of the girl that flirts with you for hours at the party, and then suddenly says \\"Well good night,\\" and she's gone.<br />Cruise plays an wildly successful New York doctor who is becomes obsessed with his wife's confession of a fantasized affair.  The confession comes out during one of the many uncomfortable and awkward conversations had in this film.  I am sure Kubric wanted us to feel uncomfortable at these moments, and Cruise and Kidman deliver.<br />Cruise, troubled by his wife's admission goes forth into New York and tries to have his own extramarital exploration.  But he fails.  He fails with a patient.  He fails with one of the super-model like hookers one always finds on the street.  He's wealthy.  He's smooth.  Hell, he is Tom Cruise!  And he cannot get any?<br />This leads him to the discovery of a mysterious and elite traveling sex club and to the most erotic and intriguing moments in the film.  With an aesthetic of the The Story of O meets the Spanish Inquisition at a mansion in the New York suburbs, my interest had now been peaked.  Here are the elite of society indulging in all manor of erotic pleasures behind the anonymity of masks... and then it is gone. Tom is soon back on the sidewalks of New York - still troubled, still [excited], and now afraid for his life.<br />So we have a mystery - or suspense.  No.  That, too, is quickly diffused and we return to awkward conversation.  The fuse just fizzles and goes out and the fireworks never go off.<br />The combination seemed so right, but the talent behind this film just does not make up for a poorly focused storyline and the decision to use the most intriguing element as a simple plot device.nd the decision to use the most intriguing element as a simple plot device.
B00005JLRR|5.0|This movie has it all.  Even First Contact, which many believe to be the best TNG movie, only had one short (but very cool) battle between ships.  After that it was all tension within the ship.  This movie is action-packed from beginning to end.  It starts off with heart-warming and appropriately humorous interactions between the regular characters and has some cameos from cast members you don't normally see in the films.  But it gets right down to some intriguing plot developments and some great fights.  The director really gets back to some of the basics of great space battles from Wrath of KahnIf you're a Trek fan, don't miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
B00006JLX4|4.0|It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since S&amp;E was released. A way better testement to Pavement's legacy than that mediocre DVD, the remaster Slanted and Enchanted contains a ton of good stuff. Definately worth the price, even if you already own the old one. Now, if Pavement would get off their collective behinds and release a b-sides collection...
B00005JGI6|3.0|Travis seems to have gone the way of Radiohead's first album. Beautiful music, beautiful harmonies, beautiful vocals before experimentation. Who can blame them? It sells British records. The difficulty is simply that; its not very difficult music. It rolls into your ears and through your head and out the other side. Its not annoying Britney pop, and not aggressive Pink pop, its not showy Christina pop, and most certainly is not the Backstreet or *NSync travesty that rule the airwaves.<br />It is different, and that may be the most compelling reason for American audiences to snatch up this record. None of the songs are as compelling as their previous effort, The Man Who, they nevertheless are less whiny, less grating. Its music to study to, to fall asleep to, even to wake up to. Its when company comes over or you've got time to really listen to music that you'd be best off removing it from the CD carousel.<br />So its a guilty pleasure? You bet.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Hey, are you kidding?  You must see this.  Especially if you were in high school in the Totally Awesome '80s.  <BR>I think the most stunning image is the face Frank shows Donnie Darko.  Obviously a rabbit, but it takes one fascinating imagination to create such a macabre face for a rabbit.  Blank eyes like boiled eggs, chipped teeth, ambigious threatening expression.  That director/screen-writer has a FIERCE imagination.    <BR>     This is truly a movie for repeated viewings, so the DVD is certainly a perfectly reasonable investment!  One must listen to the 2 commentaries to grapple with the odd doings in Donnie's life.  And the deleted scenes are lovely.  Drew Barrymore and Watership Down fans are bound to be delighted.  The commentary for the infomercial  (which is used by Patrick Swayze's sadly clueless self-help guru)  is daft and hilarious.<BR>     Put this in your collection.  Put it next to the works of Terry Gilliam and be proud of yourself.
B000002B7U|4.0|This a good album for anybody who likes anything to do with Ozzy.  I like Ultimate Sin and Lightning Strikes, however I would like to get one thing straight, Jake is a great guitar player, but Randy Rhoades could play circles around him and Zakk can imitate Jake so well it isn't even funny.  I'm not saying that this album is bad, so go out and get it!! Note: get Tribute and Live and Loud first though - you won't be disappointed!!
6303314015|5.0|I'm not sure why this film resonated so deeply with me, but even though it's animated (and I'm no Disney movie fan -- I don't shun them, it's just not typically my thing), I can honestly say that THE LION KING is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  It really is that good.  I was in my mid-20s when this movie hit the theaters (and ran up some huge box office numbers, if I recall), and I remember being amazed at how many adults were in the theater -- without kids!  Like many others, I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release of this wonderful movie.
B00004Z459|2.0|The first time I bought this CD, I probaly listened to it enough to say the lyrics fast enough (well, almost), however, soon did I relize that it was &quot;just a phase&quot;.<br />As an artist, I found the song writing so whiney, I now have to skip the track(s), I'd might as well sell it, honestly.. May I add, the song writing is issues that have already been written about.(this over said &quot;breaking&quot; and &quot;falling apart&quot;, I'd really like to send this band a Synonym book) I'd say, that's the main weakness in the nu-metal scene, Linkin Park is just adding on to the mellon collie tradegy of Nu-Metal...<br />Even a lot of the beats, I hate to say this but, it sounds rather, repetitive. Almost as If, a scientist going back to old quantum theory within confusion...
B00004STW3|3.0|MY RATING- 6.7<br />Well, let's begin to say the attitudes and reviews towards this mov here in Portugal, were mediocre-good as it always happens with a Tim Burton mov.<br />I wasn't that interested in this, I only enjoyed his Batman flicks, yet the other night they had it on tv, so I couldn't miss it. In general, it's a good mov, mildly entertaining, but not the best Burton has given to us. <BR>The starting point is, as someone has said, the parody of the old fears of 50's sfifi movs, the hysteria a la Orson Welles on alien invasion and dealing with the invaders. And Tim manages to do it well with his typical twisted view to show the hysteria that would cause an martian attack. <BR>We see a great deal of massacre by the aliens, runaways, different views on the attacks and some funny \\"experiences\\" like Sarah Jessica Parker with a dog's body or Bondian cientist Pierce Brosnan! In fact, the way of destroying the aliens come from an old tune from Sylvia Sidney radio! What a twist!<BR>Well, the mov has so many different stars, that only a couple of them create a whole new scene. Some of them appear in almost cameos- De Vito, in a minimum role, Anette Benning, as the neohippy wife of cowboy Jack Nicholson who also stars as the U.S President. In fact, only Nicholson and Glenn Close get the status of stars. Others include Rod Steiger (one of my fave actors), the now-adored Natalie Portman, a grown up Lukas Haas (from Witness), Joe Don Baker, the old lady Sylvia Sidney (loved her in the 30's movs!), Martin Short and attention to the silent appearance of Lisa Marie (Burton's girlfriend) as the female alien. Even Tom Jones appears to sing in the new world \\"It's Not Unsual\\" after escaping with Benning in a plane! Well, maybe his presence has somekind of meaning about not being unusual that some of these days we get invaded by aliens. <br />Overall, it's a nice mov, it's not even the best of the director, yet a must to anyone who enjoys his mad sense of humor, like me. Howeveri as well as many others prefer Pee Wee's Big Adventure--
0783226063|5.0|I believe that this movie is fantastic. You need to first take into account that it was made in 1984. It doesn't have the excellent eye candy of 2000's but, for it's time, it was an incredible movie. Also, you're trying to squeeze the WHOLE BOOK (which is also an excellent book, I might add) into a couple of hours. Not happening.<br />This movie has a stimulating plotline, decent graphics, and decent acting. I give this five stars because it was put together so well. It gave a good face to the character and a good visual to the characters' experiences. So, I guess I would say that this movie is a wonderful accompaniment to the book as well as eye candy sans reading the book.<br />If you are looking for something closer to the book, try checking out the made for T.V. series, Dune, from England.  It covers a lot that the movie missed and for die hard Herbet fans, it is a must see.  Just realize that it is about FIVE hours in length and made for T.V. so the budget is not as high as the orignal movie.
6302590388|2.0|MY RATING- a dubious 5.0<br />Yeah, you bet, all you french guys who think this is excellent! I found myself looking to the time in my videorecorder waiting ansiously till it finished! I know it may be naturalistic or surrealistic, yet my sincere cinematic opinion is that this is simply a bore! <BR>It's totally uncinematic, since it don't feel the mov going with a nice story to capt our attention. Just a young married couple going in a boat trip in the river and you can expect what's gonna happen- simply nothing happen! Like all french flicks!<BR>At least La Regle Du Jeu had some social critique involved.<BR>My rating is rather dubious cause of my doubts towards the quality of it. I might love this one someday when I learn more symbols or such things. In the meantime I don't have the right of give bad rating--or good rating!
B0000633T6|3.0|otherwise you'll get lost. There are a lot of flashbacks, fast edition, fast dialogues.<br />But the result is a film that makes you think, not s stupid action thriller full of plot holes.<br />Tony Scott uses his trademark skills here, mainly in the action sequences. It's great.<br />The main flaw, in my opinion, where the main characters themselves. The guys are plain killers. Ok, some may say hard times nedd hard decisions, but the fact is that one can simply not care about the characters. If Pitt's character (Tom Bishop) was executed in that Chinese prison, I would not lose my sleep. The same goes for if Redford'c character (Nathan Muir) was get by his CIA mates.
B000001EHS|5.0|I didn't realize I was such a Def Leppard fan!  I bought this for my nephew and discovered that I already knew and liked almost every song on the CD.  So I bought one for myself for in the car.  Now my husband wants one too for his car.
B00005JLRR|3.0|Okay, there are SPOILERS in this review, though I'm sure all the fanatics know what's going to happen based on the previous reviews.  The promotional campaign seems to indicate that this will be the final 'Next Generation' movie, and events in the movie seem to mark this as the end -- Riker leaves the Enterprise for his own command, and another important character apparently dies (I'll preserve the mystery for those who still don't know), although they leave things open-ended enough for a reunion to occur.  If it is the end (and I can't see them continuing the movie series with 'Voyager', 'Deep Space 9', and certainly not 'Enterprise' characters) it's a rather disappointing one. Like nearly all Star Trek movies since 'The Wrath of Khan', the science fiction element of the show takes a back seat to space battles and action/adventure.  This movie takes that trend to an extreme.  There is very little in the way of plot, and the classic Star Trek sense of adventure, exploration, and reaching out to alien races and ideas is replaced by the 'good guys' shooting ugly aliens. The fight between Riker and a Reman in a Jeffries tube at one point in the movie seems particularly pointless and gratuitous violence, with no real connection to the story. I don't think the script for this movie would ever have even been considered for an episode of the T.V. series.  Basically, this is dumbed-down Star Trek for the masses.  On the positive side, the 'Next Generation' crew still works together well -- the character chemistry is still there, and there are some fun moments shared between the crew.  Fans of Geordi LaForge's character might be disappointed by his limited role in this movie, though.  And if this is the best they can give us after four years or so, maybe it's best that this is the end.
B00005OAIE|5.0|If you are in to mellow singing, melodic guitar and lyrics that you wish you wrote yourself, John Mayor is for you.  One of the few artists where after hearing one song, once, I was hooked.  <br />I have four covers by him: Radiohead, Jimi Hendrix, Van Morisson and Toad the Wet Spocket... that should give you an idea of his infuences.
0316666343|1.0|1 star-for marketing,  0 stars- for writing. What starts off with a decent hook and a rather clever idea of heaven, quickly decends into a morass of syrupy narrative, unbeliveably trite dialogue and cardboard characters. Many, many plot holes and an annoying tendency for the characters to make leaps to correct and crucial decisions out of nowhere. I could see this book marketed as a light read for the teenagers, mostly  female, but certainly not to any reader looking for a book  that is \\"destined to become a classic.\\"<BR>Here is a small sample of the writing that set my teeth on edge:<BR>\\"She pulled Len in to her and slowly kissed him on the mouth. He seemed to hesitate at first. His body tensed, telling him NO, but that NO became vague and cloudy, became air sucked into the intake fan of the humming hydrant beside them. She reached up and unbuttoned her raincoat. He placed his hand against the thin gauzy material of her summer gown.\\" (pg. 148)<BR>WHEW!!
B00005JLRR|4.0|First and formost this is a good entertaining film.  A little above par to most Star Trek films. See it. You're going to have fun, but if you Star Trek fans feel like you've seen it before that's because you have.<br />Nemisis slavishly follows the Wrath of Khan formula to a degree that boggles the mind.<br />The similarities are almost too numerous to count, but I'm going to try anyway.<br />One, self sacrafise of a major character with potential for reincarnation of a sort.<br />Two,  ship to ship battle in a conveniently placed area of irregular space.<br />Three, secret communication between captain and crew as he says one thing and does another.<br />Four, presence of  a planet destroying device.<br />Five, personal vendetta between captain and villian.<br />To go on might reveal the story and that's not my intention.<br />If you think I'm panning this film please see that I gave it 4 stars.<br />While it lacks the originality and humor of Star Trek 4 and the whimiscal joy of Star Trek 6, it does have the grudge match intensity of Star Trek 2. Which it should, since it has Star Trek 2's plot structure.
B000069AT7|5.0|E.T. is still one of the best movies I ever saw. I do not agree with the many who write that the new edition seems to them like an other movie. The corrections are very guarded. The only great change is the bathroom scene that was not in the original version. I personally find the changes with the flying Spaceship not so good, it is too much effect stuff, I like more the old version but thats personal taste. The set comes with a great illustrated book, Soundtrack and Filmframecard (I dont very understand the reason for that one, as it is only a copy). All in all, great box!
B000009M5E|5.0|All I can say about this album is that Renata Tebaldi is the greatest Mimi I've ever come across (and I have 6 copies of Boheme).  Her lyricism is unbeatable.  I cannot listen to this album without weeping.  BUY THIS NOW!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
B00006BTCA|5.0|All you're told is true. I'm just surprised to never read what seems to me like the band's major influence of all : The Chameleons. By the way, it's just like Ian Curtis had been the Chameleons' front man. But who does remember &quot;What does anything means, basically ?&quot; or &quot;Script of the bridge&quot;, these days...? Whatever happened to Mark Burgess ?<BR>Just listen to the song PDA's final chimes : pure music, perfect, lay down on the floor, close your eyes. I feel like I'm 20 again.
B000065V41|5.0|The lovable Muppets put their own spin on Dicken's classic Christmas story.  Kermit plays Tim Cratchet, and Miss Piggy is Mrs. Cratchet.  This is a wonderful edition that should appeal to adult fans of the book as well as children just discovering the story.  I am very pleased to see it is finally available on DVD to enjoy at any time.  With several amusing and memorable songs, and wonderful characterizations including a fine rendition of Scrooge by Micael Caine, it's a movie to treasure  not only at Christmas, but at any time of year when we need a little reminder of what the holiday season is  truly all about.
B000021YQV|4.0|From the moment you hear Prison Song, the first track of System of a Down's incredible album Toxicity, you know that it is like nothing you've ever heard before. I defy anyone who wants to argue that SOAD doesn't have a unique sound to find any song by any other band that sounds remotely like Prison Song.  SOAD's sound takes the low guitar sound of nu metal, the manic pace and time changes of death, and the snotty political awareness of punk and fuses it all together with incredible songwritng and vocal harmonization to create a sound that is truly their own. Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This docudrama did something I thought almost  impossible. It presented war from a soldier's point of view and that's it. No politics, no glory, no anti-war dramatics. Just human stories brilliantly told as never before.<br />If you watch it looking for a glorification of war you'll be disappointed, for you'll see cowardice, incompetence and random loss of life.<br />If you watch it to condemn war as unnecessary and stupid, you'll be disappointed, for you'll see the cruelty of the Holocaust and the brutality of bombing and aggressive invasion that only war could stop.<br />If you watch it looking with open eyes and an open mind, you'll see a mini series in honor of the human heroes who fought  that war with all their flaws and their brilliance.<br />It's a great miniseries and I thank the men and women who made it and the men and women who inspired it .
B000002HRE|1.0|I consider this to be my least favorite Metallica album.  Overall, it's not that this is a BAD album, it's just poor quality for Metallica standards.  They are the (Note:  &quot;are&quot;, not &quot;were&quot;)  greatest heavy metal band ever.  This album does have some brillant high points; but nearly half of the songs are disappointing, &quot;filler&quot; material.  I think the song &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot; is great, and &quot;Fixxxer&quot; is very impressive.  I have mixed feelings toward some of the songs.  For example, &quot;Fuel&quot; is rip-roaring, except for the mindlessly generic &quot;Van Halen-esque&quot; lyrics of &quot;...hey, cars!...woo, fast!...&quot;etc.  I don't feel that this or the Load album showed that Metallica &quot;sold out&quot;.  These albums show the band going in other directions and genres; yes, certainly Load/Reload are a step down from the heavier sound that preceded them.  (Personally, I think their music from the '80's was superior)  One final note, the &quot;Unforgiven II&quot;, which isn't as much of a knock-off of Unforgiven as you might assume, is confusing however:  I mean, is it unforgiven &quot;too&quot; or is it the number &quot;2&quot;?  You can't even really tell, so what's the deal w/ that.  To conclude, Reload (despite my 1 star rating), a pretty good album, but certainly not Metallica's best album
B000075BFK|5.0|This CD is a must have.  It's a little better than Until the end of time and rivals R U still down. It could be the best one since The seven day theory. Good lyrics, but the beats kinda overshadow pac, more &quot;today&quot; beats (don't expect it to be like an early pac album) <br />all in all it's worth the money<BR>.... ooh and a great listen is My block (remix)
B000065TQR|5.0|Yeah, this is very, very good! The first Fairie's album, reissued with great bonus tracks, is a mind-melting mix of drug-fuelled psychedelic atmospheres and scorching, feedback-driven acid guitar garage rock, with a remarkable nod to what would be later called 'punk rock'. Great lyrics, raging vocals, a fierce rhythm section and veritable SMOKING classics, like \\"Uncle Harry's Last Freakout\\", \\"Do It\\", \\"The Snake\\" & \\"Teenage Rebel\\".
B00006IUL7|4.0|A homicide detective from L.A. is assigned to solve the murder of a teenaged girl in a coastal Alaskan town. Unaccustomed to the perpetual daylight in that part of the world, he is unable to sleep. His mental state begins to deteriorate and he finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into a web of his own making. As he is manipulated by the killer, he's forced to wonder if the two men have more than a little in common.<br />Al Pacino, in the lead role, is a joy to watch as usual. I always find myself enjoying his performances, even in substandard films (which this isn't.) Robin Williams is surprisingly good; perhaps dramatic roles are his true calling (I've never found him funny.) Hilary Swank plays the local rookie who is teamed with Pacino's veteran character. Katharine Isabelle (GINGER SNAPS) appears in a smaller but significant role as the murdered girl's best friend.  And one can't talk about this film without mentioning the beautiful location, which the director and cinematographer take full advantage of.<br />This isn't your typical \\"police stalking a killer\\" story.  We find out fairly early who the murderer is, and the protagonist even meets him face-to-face.  But the action is more about the protagonist himself, and the issues surrounding him.  Though there is information that is not revealed until the end, it is more a psychological drama than a murder mystery.<br />The DVD contains a wealth of special features, including a technically-oriented director commentary (presented in shooting order), and select scene commentary from Swank and assorted production personnel. There is also a casual conversation between director Christopher Nolan and Pacino, and some behind the scenes featurettes. The most unusual is a short production featuring interviews with real life insomniacs as well as medical professionals. <br />INSOMNIA is a worthy follow-up to MEMENTO. Just remember, when you have insomnia, you're never really asleep, and you're never really awake...
6305508550|5.0|I loved this movie from the opening credits to the very end.  I've worked at several offices and call centers just like the main character's and it's really just like it.  I remember before I left my last job they just had a \\"Hawaiian Shirt Day\\"!  That made me remember this movie.  There are so many great jokes from the movie and hilarious situation that's it's hard to pinpoint just one.  The office has all the office stereotypes: 10-15 different annoying bosses, the quiet, mild-mannered-freaky guy that you think could go off any minute, the old guy who hates his job but is constantly afraid of getting fired, the irritating receptionist, and the programmers who get no respect.  The movie is accompanied by some gangsta rap music which is in itself odd, but makes the movie just that much more funny (esp. the fax machine beat-down scene).  If you've worked in an office or IT setting this movie will have you busting out loud comparing it to all of your experiences, but even if you haven't worked in that environment you'll still love this movie and laugh constantly. I recommend this movie to all who love a good comedy with some crude (but not American Pie crude) humor.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I bought this CD just to hear Barbra sing with Josh Groban and much to my delight, I found the whole thing to be really great. Her duet with Josh is worth the price of the CD in my opinion, but the other 18 duets are very good too.  My favorites are her duets with Celine Dion and Michael Crawford, and of course with Josh.  Those three are awesome.  This CD has become one of my favorites and I listen to it every day.
B00003CX5P|5.0|No matter how people might have been disappointed with the movie, I believe that it is a great movie overall and it is the beginning of the saga. OK, the pod-race was really too long and Jar Jar Binks was slightly annoying but the film contained several great scenes as well. It is overall very exciting by itself and also as a part of the whole saga.<br />The DVD contains very interesting interviews with almost everyone and additional shootage. The images are clear, the sound spectacular and it is really a must have for the dedicated.<br />This is the only Phantom Menace we will have for a very very long time. So get it now and keep it for a lifetime.
B00003CXAY|5.0|\\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" has held up well over the years since I first saw it at the cinema. Its images were almost all as powerful via this DVD as I remember them having been 20 years ago. Those that have worn a little thin--notably the transition from a satellite view of a city to an extreme close-up of a computer chip--have done so because they have been so often imitated and repeated since \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" was first seen. <br />I found \\"Powaqqatsi\\" less riveting on this first viewing than \\"Koyaanisqatsi,\\" but noticed that it resonated longer in my mind and provoked more thought and conversation later. Its images and ideas have remained with me for weeks now.<br />The \\"Qatsi\\" films are unique works, neither documentary nor entertainment in the strict sense of either term. Nor are they mere visual social commentaries. The music of Philip Glass, the amazing, often context-less cinematography, the editing, and the philosophical underpinnings that drive the enterprise, all combine in a work that defies categorization but can't fail to stir the viewer.<br />The DVDs each contain a commentary section featuring writer-directory Godfrey Reggio and composer Glass. The commentaries provide some concreteness in the vast abstraction of the work, but I made the mistake of watching the \\"Powaqqatsi\\" commentary before seeing the film, and it diminished the film's impact. I recommend savoring the films themselves at least once before going to the commentaries.
0800141326|1.0|They should've left the king of monsters to the Japanese. Atleast they could convince a guy to burn up in a hot suit while giving one [heck] of a show. The only times I liked the movie was when Broderick was nose to nose with Godzilla and when Godzilla jumped onto a building and did a classic roar to the skies.<br />Bottom line, read the review title. And the only reason I posted 1 star is cuz I couldn't leave it blank.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Star Trek Nemesis is number 10 in the Star Trek series, and continues a trend that Star Trek II started twenty years ago, continued by number IV number VI and number VII.  That trend, for those of you who aren't Trekkies like myself, is the Even Phenomenon.  Every Star Trek movie with an even number has been good.<br />That said, a lot of pressure was on the cast and crew to pump out a good movie, particularily if this is to be the final adventure of Picard and his crew.<br />And they came through magnificently with Nemesis.<br />The first half hour is all that stands in the way of this movie recieving five stars, but the corny dialoge ends quickley enough and we are thrust back into the Star Trek Universe aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise once more, and once again we are on a mission to save Earth.<br />The cast dilivers a stunning performance, the effects give new light to Star Trek warfare, there are plenty of suprises and one pariticular factor that was absent in the last movie returns - humor.<br />Nemesis is not just a good Star Trek movie, nor just a good science fiction movie, its a good movie period.  The only thing that could ruin this movie is if they make a Star Trek XI.  The ending was a perfect farewell to the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise-E, it may even bring a tear to your eye.
B0000025C0|5.0|Although Boston's debut album is by far their best seller, and seems to be the favorite Boston record of everyone I know, it's not mine.  In my oppinion, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is Boston's best.  I played this baby constantly in college, and it still sounds fresh today.  Every song is so good, it's difficult to say which one is my favorite.  Objectively, I would say &quot;A Man I'll Never Be&quot; and &quot;Feelin' Satisfied&quot; may be the best written songs, but &quot;Don't Be Afraid&quot; is the song I can't listen to sitting down.  I'm not sure if I've heard that song in a long time without my voice screeching along with it.<br />All in all, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is THE classic Boston album for me!
B00005RY7X|5.0|OK, a word of warning about this album. Prepare yourself for some really happy, turbo-charged, rebellious punk/metal hybrid, REALLY heavy guitars accompanied by keyboards pounded kamikaze style, replete with some rude but mostly positive lyrics. And most of the songs clock in at 2 to 3:15 minutes so they are a quick burst of adrenaline! As Andrew WK loudly declares from the get-go, \\"IT'S TIME TO PARTY!\\" Twelve anthemic songs with the loud, rough-voiced Andrew WK, and there are NO soft songs here. I MEAN IT!!! Use the following from \\"It's Time To Party\\" as a guide: \\"Don't even try and deny it/'Cos you're gonna have a Party tonight/And you know we're gonna do it tonight/We're gonna lose it all/When you open your door!\\" Ready? Alrighty-then!<br />\\"Party Hard\\" is the ultimate party song with metal-up-your-you-know-what that exceeds that old time favourite, \\"Rock And Roll All Nite.\\" The attitude's the same, except that it makes KISS sound like Savage Garden. Remember these lyrics, you'll be screaming them soon: \\"So let's get a party going (let's get a party going)/Now it's time to party and we'll party hard (party hard)/Let's get a party going (let's get a party going)/When it's time to party we will always party hard.\\"<br />\\"Girls Own Love\\" starts out with a piano before accompanied by drums then that familiar crunchy punk/metal sound. This is more punk. It acknowledges that the other sex has the monopoly on the rules of love. I mean hey, they can take your heart and run it over with a steamroller.<br />\\"Ready To DieEis a song whose key lyrics are: \\"You better get ready to die/You better get ready to kill/You better get ready to run/Cause here we come/You better get ready to die!\\" Not literally speaking for sure.  Even so, it's in a fun sort of way.<br />\\"Take It Off\\" continues the fun hyper-energetic romp. The chorus of \\"Forever and ever\\" made me think that Andrew WK is a punk/metal version of Meat Loaf minus lots of pounds and chockfull of attitude.<br />The pounding stomp of \\"I Love NYC\\" is reminiscent of an AC-DC song, except AC-DC never had a swathe of synthesizers pounded along with the guitars.<br />\\"She's So Beautiful\\" is probably the most extreme love song I've heard. It's a close cousin to \\"Party Hard\\" rhythmically speaking. It begins with a metal guitar, and then... BOOM! It seems geared towards all those pinups, adult magazine models, and for me, the lovely singers I've had the pleasure to hear and movie stars I've seen on video and the silver screen. So this song's for you, ladies.<br />\\"Party Til You Puke\\" is street mob anarchy run wild, But how can one feel downright disturbed with the fun guitar/keyboards smashing its way into one's psyche?<br />The rest of the songs? \\"Fun Night\\" is the kind of song that might have worked well for KISS during their Asylum/Crazy Nights era. \\"Got To Do It\\" has a stomping rhythm reminiscent of Generation X's \\"English Dream.\\" And so on.<br />If GG Allin had traded in the hardcore misanthropy and directed that energy towards something positive (not that he shouldn't have sold out, he had to be himself, right?) and accepted some more polished punk up-the-YNW, he might have sounded like Andrew WK. By the time you finish this album, you'll have shaken to it so hard, it'll be a while before you realize your head has been flung clear from your body. It's THAT ENERGETIC! Pores will be forced open, you will become a hirsute Neanderthal. Heck, it even opened the eyes of an emotionally jaded cynic like me. Definitely one of the albums of this year. Now excuse me, it's time for me to crash exhausted to the ground and wake up years later.g stomp of \\"I Love NYC\\" is reminiscent of an AC-DC song, except AC-DC never had a swathe of synthesizers pounded along with the guitars. <br />\\"She's So Beautiful\\" is probably the most extreme love song I've heard.

B0000640VO|5.0|As every other review has said, this is a great movie!<BR>The girl is so delightful and the story line is so different from every other movie I've seen in my life!<BR>You gotta love french movies, they always are trying to be one of a kind; but this one wins all the trophies in my book!<BR>It is definitely a must see, Audrey's (as we say in spanish) 'picardia' is so adorable.<BR>I can't say enough about this movie, I'd give it 6 stars if I could!!<BR>It is definitely one of my all time favorites for sure!
B00006CXXU|4.0|I must say, Christina Aguilera has really improved since her last album.  There is now a strenth in her voice that didn't exist back in her Britney-rivalry-pop days, and a deepness in her lyrics that brings a tear to your eye.  All in all, this album is not only an extraordinary improvement, it's a brand new Christina Aguilera.  Although, I cannot say this CD goes without any mistakes.  First off, she claims this is who she is and who he has been all along, but the music lacks consistancy so it is hard to believe.  Now, don't get me wrong, I am happy there is a variety, and that she wrote/co-wrote 18/20 songs, but there is some pop that reflects her last album too much (i.e. Infatuation) and doesn't fit all the claims she made about leaving that image.  Another fault is the length.  So many people have commented on it that I think it's self explanitory.  But looking back on the record, the only songs I would even consider getting rid of are Dirrty and Infatuation, which are frighteningly catchy, and, after you listen to these songs for a while, you begin to like them.  Christina's voice is what I come back to for the good of her album.  She doesn't overdue the licks, she sings with soul.  You can tell she sings with a passion and that is what makes her a star.  I recommend this album to anyone who can see past her mistake with the video for &quot;Dirrty&quot; and take in her inspiring lyrics and her truely wonderful voice.
B000002J1O|5.0|In my 30 years of to be a listener of Rock and 500 LP's and 300 CD's (I begun with Beatles when I was 3 years old) this album is my favourite of all times although maybe the best Work of Genesis is the gold standart of progressive rock &quot;The Lamb lies...&quot;. All of about this  albums has been writed, I'm going only to say that this album is OBLIGATORY to all fan that like the progressive rock because this album is part of the root of this face of Rock.
B000075BFK|5.0|I've read some reviews not only here but other sites, and I agree &quot;Ghetto Star&quot; is a hot track as for the album it's better than Until the end of time but not better than All Eyes on Me, I've heard it's already platinum, too bad &quot;Ghetto Star can't be a video or radio cut.
0151008116|5.0|This book is timeless. It will take you on many journeys. Some you will like...some you will not. But, in the end it will bring you home. Home to your God.
0676974562|5.0|I myself am a writer, so that is part of the reason Atonement may have resonated so strongly with me, but I think a larger reason why I liked this book so much is BECAUSE of McEwan's character development. People have said that it stopped after part one, however I don't think it did. Reality is many people are haunted by their past and it often times effects their lives thereafter. Briony's whole family was torn apart by her &quot;crime&quot; and that would have a lasting effect on a child, an effect that never would have been had on an adult. Children deal with the problems of life much differently than adults, and how Briony dealt with her dilemas as a child is the basis of the book. And although yes, the book is very much about the craft and power of writing, something that did strike a very strong cord with me, it is also about the pain of  love and the human heart and the power of forgiveness. To overlook these elements of the book is a big loss to the reader.<BR>From a writing standpoing, McEwan writes beautifully. Although slow at parts in the beginning, the novel is thoroughly engrossing after the first 50 pages. McEwan is such a descriptive writer that  you can acually almost picture as if you are there. Some people may think this tedious and boring, but I think it adds valuable depth and character to the story. <BR>Overall, Atonement is a well developred, beautifully written novel that I recommend to anyone who wants a book with a fair amount of emotional depth.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I would like to thank Diane Huggins' husband for refusing to watch this and let his wife rent it. This movie was a bunch of garbage. The movie was rated PG-13 for Sustained Intense War Sequences, Imanges of Wounded, Breif Sensuality and Some language. Some language. The actors/actress in this movie must have swear at least 50 times and that is not some lanuage. Pearl Harbor was bomed on the day of December 7, 1941. And 60 years after that this dumb movie was made. The movie starts on Disc 1 and the last 54 minutes are on Disc 2 (which I didn't expect). If you have read this review and found it helpul please vote. But If you have read this review and not found it helpful please don't vote. Did Hollywood think we needed this movie? I am glad that neither me or my parents was born or living on December 7, 1941. Please trust me and skip this movie because there are much better movies out there. Pearl Harbor was bomed by the Japenease. Which means me wonder what people of America did to the people of Japan that made them to decide to bomb Pearl Harbor. At the time of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii was not one of the United States. Please do not view this movie. This movie really does deserve zero stars. This movie should not have been made in the first place. All copies of this movie should be destroyed. Or if not, locked in a castle of films to never be released, just as long as you stay away from this movie.
B000065V41|3.0|I love this movie. So where is the song 'When love has gone' which Belle sings to a young scrooge which was in the video and film version. I bought my DVD in England so is the American version any different? Some of the customer reviews only mention that the film is in pan and scan and not widescreen but never that a song is missing. Is then the UK version different from the American? Has anybody any answers? By the way I would love to give this film 5 stars but my DVD copy only merits three stars!
B000050X31|4.0|A generally enjoyable DVD!<br />Die Zauberflote, Mozart's last opera, performed on this disc by the Metropolitan Opera under the direction of James Levine.<br />The cast features such stars as Kathleen Battle (Pamina), Fancisco Araiza (Tamino), Manfred Hemm (Papageno), Kurt Moll  (Sarasto), and Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night. Brian Large, who has vast experience with opera, directs this major work.<br />This opera showcases the voice and acting skills of Kathleen Battle: she is brilliant, beautiful and with a voice that could only be described as a gift. Also noteworthy are the exquisite vocals by Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night. However, it is Manfred Hemm as Papageno who steals the spotlight: from beginning to end, his funny interpretation of his character (accompanied by his great voice) carries this work to its fitting conclusion.<br />The only negative comment (thus the loss of one star) was the surreal quality of the sets. Frankly, I thought they were ugly and if anything, detracted from an otherwise stellar performance. Also the overture featured, I felt, a little too much of James Levine: surely, some more shots of the orchestra could have been inserted here somewhere.<br />While The Magic Flute is not my favorite opera by Mozart, this is, all things being considered, an enjoyable performance. Musically, I could honestly recommend this DVD.
B000001FSR|4.0|At the age of 20, I was introduced to the world of Tom Waits with this album. It remains one of my favourites of his. <BR>FWY did get some lukewarm critical response at the time of it's release, and there are things to be aware of before you buy it. First, if you don't like Waits, you will most likely deteste this one. And if you like, or even love Tom Waits, this still could be more Waits than even you can handle.<BR>You see, this is an album where Tom Waits sounds like himself, and no one else. It's predecessor, &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;, did have some radio friendly material. On FWY however, there is nothing that Rod Stewart could have turned into a hit.<BR>The album was recorded and released in the mid 1980's. Tom Waits' calendar however, must have frozen around the year of 1955. Elvis, Beatles, psychedelia, folk rock, punk/New Wave, name any category of pop and rock music, no matter how obscure. When listening to this album, it is like none of that had ever happened. <BR>Of all the people working in the field of popular music, Waits most definetely has the strangest, most peculiar musical taste. His favourite band is Salvation Army. Even how much he detests (and I think he does!) the development of rock music from 1956 and on, he seems to have the deepest respect for it's roots, like blues, bluegrass and jazz. Mix this up with some warped, twisted version of a Weimar Republic cabaret, and Waits' musical landscape is set.<BR>Waits was accused for sounding like a parody of himself on this album, and really, he is a bit over the top on some of the tracks. The fact that it's a concept album, telling the story of Frank, is the only way he can possibly get away with a song like &quot;I'll take New York&quot;.<BR>Sure, this music isn't for everyone. But if you're tired of mainstream music, and want to hear something completely different, very talented music, FWY is warmly recommended. If you can't appreciate it, then make like a hockeyplayer and get the PUCK outta here!
B00005OMTT|1.0|how can anyone listen to this garbage.this is pure slop.enigma are still the worst of ever,next to enya of course.you want boring sound that makes no sense,the get this.you want good music,buy yourself a nice death metal cd.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I bought this c.d. I was expecting punk rock, so when I listened to it I was a bit surprised. &quot;Let Go&quot; is more pop than anything. At first I was disappointed, but once I got around my original expectations and actually listened to the album I realized it was actually good. Avril Lavigne has an amazing voice, insightful lyrics and catchy melodies. Seriously, I dare you to listen to the album and not get at least one of the songs stuck in your head. It may be pop, but it's not the bubble gum variety, the lyrics are meaningful and she doesn't sound like every other singer out there. Avril Lavigne is talented and original, and her debut album is proof of that.
B000002H33|3.0|This is a good album to listen to for a few months but it gets old/and repetitive after awile. It seems like the songs are very similar to me.<br />Battery and Damange Inc sound alike<BR>Master Of Puppets and Disposable Heroes sound alike<BR>The Thing That Should Not Be and Leper Messiah sound alike.<br />The two unique songs are the best on the album.<BR>Orion is amazing. Cliff Burton is an outstanding bassist.<BR>Sanitarium is also a great song.<br />I think Metallica reached there peak with And Justice For All. That album has by far better songwriting then Master of Puppets. I find that album to have much more variety and it stands the test of time much better then Master of Puppets.<br />This is not a bad record but I think there are better thrash albums out there.<br />And Justice For All: Metallica<BR>Kill Em' All : Metallica<BR>Peace Sells But Who's Buying: Megadeth<BR>Rust In Peace: Megadeth<BR>Spreading The Disease: Anthrax<BR>Painkiller: Judas Priest
B00005JLRR|5.0|This review isn't just in anticipation on Star Trek: Nemesis, I actually did just go out and see it!  I must say that I'd read an early version of the script nearly a year ago, and thought to myself, \\"Oh geez, another one of these stories that has little or no point.\\"  And when the film was reviewed on Dec. 13, the film's release date, I must say I was inclined to agree with the critics, based on the script I read.  I thought it was going to be another film like Insurrection, kinda neat but with very little relevance to the Star Trek universe.<br />Well, after actually seeing the final version, I must say I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was blown away!  I'm not going to give away a single thing about the film; I'll just say it was very nicely atmospheric, the performances were outstanding, especially that of Patrick Stewart (Capt. Picard), and the visual effects were enough to leave me sitting in the movie theatre with my mouth hanging open!<br />The rest of the crew were used more than in the previous two films, to round the cast a bit more this time, and the bad guy, Shinzon, was given some very real depth, which is rare lately in the Star Trek universe, especially for characters who are in a single episode or film.  <br />I will say this about the story, still not giving anything away:  the ending is actually a very pleasant was to end the Next Gen cast story, a bit happy and a bit bittersweet.  Very nicely done.<br />This film is living proof that you can't always believe the critics, even when they seem to come to a general consensus about a film.  I learned a sore lesson with Nemesis:  make up your own mind about films, and don't believe what the critics say overly much.  If you do, you'll miss a treat of a film
B000001IQH|5.0|I got this song for Christmas two years ago after my friend first introduced me to punk music.  I was at a difficult time in my life, and matters were being made much worse by a move across the country.  So I needed some great music to get me through it all.  And that's exactly what I found in this album.<br />The album is the perfect balance of songs that I can relate to and those that I can't, but understand and sympathise with.  I remember sitting in my empty house and listening to \\"Olympia, WA,\\" almost in tears at understanding the homesickness Tim was singing about.  But then again I can listen to \\"Maxwell Murder\\" and empathise, not even having been in that situation before.  This album helped me get through a lot.  The raw passion put into the music is amazing.  I wouldn't have it any other way.<br />This is the perfect first punk album, and a must-have for any fan of punk music.  Some may claim that it isn't punk or that they are posers, but who cares what everyone else thinks?  My advice is that you download a few Rancid songs (from this album, I would suggest \\"Time Bomb,\\" Ruby Soho,\\" or \\"Olympia WA.\\")and if you like them, buy it.  You will not be disappointed. <br />Where would punk music be without Rancid?  Nowhere.
B00000K0E5|5.0|GoldenEye is quite simply the best 007 film ever made.  In terms of plot realism, villains and action, it stands out against the rest.  The film sees James Bond take on his former best friend Alec Trevelyn, otherwise known as agent 006, who plans to seek revenge on the world for the loss of his parents through the use of the deadly GoldenEye satellite.  Trevelyn is THE best Bond villain ever, and has not been matched since- he knows Bond back to front, and proves that he is a more than worthy adversary (unlike certain other Bond villains, not mentioning any names).  Some may believe the plot is a little far- fetched, but such satellites do actually exist in the real world.  Other villains such as USSR General Ouromov and Xenia Onatopp provide endless excuses for Bond to blow things up, which of course he does in style, and within numerous locations including St. Petersburg, Russia; Havanna, Cuba; and England (watch out for the scene where Bond drives a fully armed tank through the streets of St. Petersburg!).  This time, the Bond girl is Natalya Simonova, a computer programmer who knows who plans to use the GoldenEye and how to disarm it.  She inevitably falls for Bond's charms.  And as for Pierce Brosnan,  he blows the audience away as he takes on the role for the very first time, and proves that he has the ability to compete with even the likes of Sean Connery himself when playing Commander James Bond.  Again, this is the very best James Bond film to date, even better than the new Die Another Day, which was quite frankly very ordinary.  If you are a 007 fan, look no further than this film- it put the Bond franchise back on its feet, and showed us that after forty-or-so years he still has the ability to keep us shaken and stirred.
B00006M183|4.0|When the Rolling Stones sold their souls to the Devil no one complained. So, we could say that Pearl Jam must have done the same back in the day...and now they are paying for it with half baked albums, like the Stones, right? well, yes and no.<BR>Pearl Jams' Riot Act album follows what seemed an eternity of waiting for this, lack of a better word, fan...Riot Act  is stronger than Binoural by simply being more melodic. The album starts out with a great intro song titled CAN'T KEEP, which just kept building on itself. SAVE ME, the second song takes off where Can't Keep leads off...Eddie Vedder's vocals are back in top flight for this song...think of Hail Hail vocals and sound.  Now the real dope stuff starts with I AM MINE AND THUMBING MY WAY. Yes, these are the two cuts that made me purchase this album. One listen of<BR>Thumbing my way and I was sold. Other standout songs are 1/2 FULL, ARC, ALL OR NONE and CROPDUSTER. The worst song is not really bad it's just cheesy and too preachy. I wish the lyrics had been a bit more sophisticated but then they seem honest  and that might be for the better.  RIOT ACT does have a consistent flow of rythm but I have to say that while fellow Pearl Jam members play with convinction in every song...Eddie Vedder's voice seems  much too restrained. One gets the impression that he is just not feeling it anymore. You are left thinking that some of  these songs could have been better sung and jammed out a bit longer and that this is actually a bootleg rehersal...In the end I was a satistifed customer..now I just wish they'd make a video, even if it's just with claymation or stand ins....come on fellas give us some more juice!
B00005T30L|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful film.  For being low budget, it is incredibly well cast, with the protagonists being mean yet likeable, and everyone else seems just as freakin' annoying as they do to any outsider.  I don't feel the need to repeat what's been said, so i'll just summarize by saying that this is a very funny movie, with a soundtrack that's very different, yet really sets the mood well.  I mostly wanted to comment on the ending, which some people seem to see as some sort of cop-out.  What these people are missing is a true understanding of how it feels to be outside of everyone.  When nobody seems to understand, even those you trust most, things like the crazy guy waiting for a bus that never comes become the only concrete things in life.  Enid stepping onto that bus represts her need to get away from everything normal, everything she knows, and to just leave town on a bus that shouldn't exist.  I guess to understand it, you have to have been in a situation before where you'd rather just take off into the unknown, and leave behind all that you've built; when all your friends and family have become what you fear and hate, it's better to just go somewhere, anywhere, else.  Consider yourself lucky if you have no idea what i'm talking about.  But if you do, check this movie out.
B00005JLRR|1.0|First off, to the  person who had the first posting, it is Commander RIKER, not Ricker.  Sound it out.  I just saw this film in the theatre.  What a wasted two hours.  Not enough character development, poor cinematography, and terrible dialogue.  And....what was the point of killing Data????  I mean, this film makes Star Trek V look like a gem!  Don't waste the time or money.  I don't even think I will buy the DVD.
B00005UKKF|2.0|Okay I saw the concert. And I wasn't impressed. The whole presentation was confusing and didn't make sense. I wish she had better direction and guidance because every performance was weak and watered down. But then again I am spoiled. I have been to countless concerts (madonna, janet jackson, shakira, etc). and I have never seen a concert so poorely done. No wait, there was vanilla ice. But besides that for an artist who is suppose to be a pop princess, she isn't showing it. <br />I really did expect a lot more from her than this.
B000001ELR|5.0|As a die hard Kiss fan for 24 years I find this CD, along with \\"Alive!\\", \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Revenge\\" to be one of their best.  The Drums are incredible particularily on \\"Danger\\", \\"I Love It Loud\\" and \\"Saint & Sinner.\\"  I still find it hard to believe 20 years later that this is one of their less selling CDs, probably 2nd to \\"Music From The Elder.\\"  The only downside to this album is that Ace Frehley does not play on it(although he is pictured on the cover).  A great album...if you are a beginning Kiss fan, you MUST buy this CD.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This album showed the girl is human and has needs. A more sexual side of her comes out...which is okay for her to admit (im a slave for you). She's admitting that she's not perfect and has made some screw ups (I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman). The song \\"boys\\" makes no sense to me. Although I get the lyrics. <br />She shows she knows nothing about rock music of the 1980's (I Love Rock 'n' Roll). The songs \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" didn't make much sense. Somtimes I wish the girl would just say what she wants to say instead of hiding it. <br />Now I loved \\"Let Me Be\\". Although the lyrics made no sense.<BR>\\"Anticipating\\" sounds like a song from the 1970's.<BR>\\"overprotected\\" is a good one.<BR>\\"lonely\\" seems like this was directed towards justin.<br />The songs you'll really like is the ones that are extras. Now those are different and nice. <br />Overall the cd is better than I thought. More grown up. This cd isn't for kids at all. What I don't like is that she copies too much from other artists. She needs to develop her own sound, moves, and vibe. If she doesn't she will be considered yesterdays news.
0316666343|5.0|This book covers a difficult topic but does so with such tenderness and delicacy that something that is usually so sad and too hard for most to deal with becomes a poignant story of a young girls perspective on her own death. <br />It is one of the best books I have read in a while and was a thought provoking but not demanding read.<br />A good read for someone coming to terms with death or anyone who wants something really great to read over the Christmas break.
B00004SCX6|2.0|This CD isn't the best. <br />The songs that are good are \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" (sounds like a guy is in love with her but she isnt in love with him). \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" (her refusing to change the way she presents herself in public), \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Lucky\\". I like these songs because she was being honest. <br />The songs \\"One Kiss From You\\", \\"Where Are You Now\\", \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\", \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\", Dear Diary\\", \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" should not have been on the disc. And the bonus songs are no good either. They aren't good as far as lyrics, vocals and music. <br />Overall, this disc is about personal preference. I am not a child so I am going to expect more from my music. And she just didn't give me much to work with on this CD. I was really dissapointed. I thought she would have grown from the first cd<BR>as far as quality.
0066214122|2.0|My biggest complaint about the book was the incredibly obvious foreshadowing.  Every single thing that ends up being used as a plot device is trotted out 3 or 4 times as examples before it's actually used by the characters. <BR>It made reading the book an exercise in guessing when the characters will get to using \\"plot device X\\" <BR>An example: (not based on the book, but in the same style and heavy handedness)<BR>(early in the book) \\"Gee Joe, ya'd better not touch that switch without first REMOVING ALL THE METAL FROM YOUR BODY.\\"<BR>(several time in the book) Joe went to switch on the electromagnetic-doohicky.  In his haste, he had left on his stainless steel watch.  Biff jumped in and stopped Joe just in time.<BR>\\"HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TELL YOU do not touch that switch without first REMOVING ALL THE METAL FROM YOUR BODY\\"<BR>(Climax of the book) Joe's nemesis entered the main electromagnetic-doohickey chamber holding the TITANIUM PENCIL SHAPENER he had just used to kill everyone else in the plant.  Joe threw his plastic (cuz he'd finally remembered to remove his metal objects after the 800th reminder) wristwatch at the ON switch. The electromagnetic-doohickey instantly generated a powerful electromagnetic (duh) field that ripped the TITANIUM PENCIL SHARPENER into a zillion pieces.  Oh, the pieces ripped his nemesis into a zillion pieces as well.  <br />You get the point.  This happens in the book in a dozen places.  Some real book examples, pounded into our thick skulls over and over before they are used as a plot device:<br />Don't clog that filter, or everthing will blow up! <BR>Don't turn off the coolant to that doohickey!<BR>That contaminant destroys the microthingies (I wonder if anyone will use it to destroy the microthingies?)<br />There's more, but I'll leave it at that.  <br />It was a fun book and an enjoyable read, but it wasn't the new Andromeda Strain.
B000066NW0|4.0|I love this record. This album shows that teenagers can be talented and write and play their own music. The self-proclaimed skate punk, has it down; appealing to both guys and girls. Her music is kickin'; it has punk and rock meddlings but still pop enough to be played on radio; and without sounding over-produced and watered down. It sounds fresh; but it still has its lyrical points where it slips. But you got to give her credit; she's still a teenager, when she gets older and more mature, she will be one of the best singer/songwriters out there. but for now; 'Let Go' is a good introduction of whats to come.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|Notre Dame de Paris:  wonderful staging, passionate, talented professional performers.
B00007E8V4|5.0|i think this album was the better of the first two, although those were very good but my favorite would have to be steal this album....   they have not changed and that is what i like about them.  Chic N stu is a reminiscent of Suite Pee   ( i love their album openers )  and Mr Jack is in the same field as Spiders.  I love the rock of soad but i like when they are slow as seen with \\"Roulette\\" Great acoustic track   The album is strong and has a good flow. the only track that fails here is 36  Song highlights are  BUBBLES, HIGHWAY SONG, F*** THE SYSTEM, ROULETTE, STREAMLINE, INNER VISION, MR JACK
0451191153|1.0|I think this is one of those books you either love or hate.  I hated it.  The characters were, simply put, miserable and pathetic.  I am glad I know no such person in real life
B00005JLRR|4.0|I WOULD say this is the best \\"Star Trek\\" movie ever. It's full of exciting conflict and great visual effects. But the ending will depress even the most hardcore \\"Trek\\" fans. But it is worth the time. Bring the tissues, though. Grade: B+
B00005RFAI|4.0|I knew that I would like at least one of the songs but i did not expect the onslaught that awaited me...The chick can definately carry a key and kept my attention long enough from pressing the eject button.I dont believe I will get bored of this album thankfully because the radio has not killed any particular song..I think family portrait is an abosutely powerful song with strong lyrics and beautful harmonies. Waiting to see what she can come with next.
B00001IVOR|4.0|Wu Tang had a lot to live up to with this second album.  The 36 Chambers has gone down as a classic, and like most rappers, having incredible debut albums seems to curse the sequels.  &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, though, makes a great effort at living up to its older brother.  Unfortunately, it still falls short.<BR>   Spanning 2 discs and a total of 27 tracks, all 9 (excluding Cappadonna) members gets a nice big bite out of the pie, my personal favorite being RZA.  What really makes this album stick out is the fact that it came out at a time when rap was starting to lose its street credentials and gaining more popularity in the mainstream.  &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; put some of the streets back into it, especially with songs like &quot;Severe Punishment&quot;, &quot;The City&quot;, and of course &quot;Triumph&quot;.  Every rapper stays on top of their game as they lay down the lyrics.  Where it starts to get sloppy though is the beats.  As compared to the first, instrumentals have lost their rugged edge and have been replaced with more...how should I say...average rap beats.  Kung-Fu flick quotes still run abundant, but maybe if they added more of those into the songs themselves (like they did in &quot;Severe Punishment&quot; and &quot;Hellz Wind Staff&quot;) it would sound a lot better.  What I REALLY hate about this album though is track 15 of the second CD, &quot;Second Coming&quot;.  I just don't get it.  Nobody raps in it... its just some female voice singing an R&amp;B song.  I mean, the other flaw isn't so bad, but this...to me it really hurts &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;'s overall score.  I don't know what RZA was thinking when he decided to put this track in the final cut.  Bad mistake my friend.<BR>   &quot;The 36 Chambers&quot; is something hard to surpass, but unlike most follow-ups, this one has much to be proud of.  Maybe the beats aren't exactly there, and &quot;Second Coming&quot; was totally uncalled for, but in the end it is a awesome album.  Forthose of you who are really into the Wu, you shouldn't be dissapointed.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't give out five star ratings left and right. Four stars maybe, but to get a five star review, an album has to have that special something that puts it a head above the class. OK Computer certianly lives up to that standard. If you're a fan of '90s alternative (as broad a term as that is), and you don't own this...well, what's wrong with you?!<br />First of all, Thom Yorke is an excellent singer. He has a powerful presence, and a tinge of desperate emotion that works very well in the context of an album like this. The lyrics range from a little silly (&quot;please could you stop the noise I'm trying to get some rest / from all the unborn chicken voices in my head&quot;), to darkly touching (&quot;breathe, keep breathing / I can't do this alone&quot;), to downright creepy (&quot;either way you turn I'll be there / open up your skull I'll be there / climbing up the walls&quot;). <br />As a whole, thematically, the album is about what many great albums have been about: isolation. The songs make one feel small in a world full of buzzing machines and big governments that are slowly stamping the life out of the average person. At the same time we depend on them for our survival, it's that very dependence that's actually killing us. There are also a lot of references (subtle or imagined: you be the judge) to '1984.'<br />Musically speaking, Radiohead is an alternative band and they behave like one, but a good one. Some songs have loud, rocking electric guitars (&quot;Electioneering&quot;, parts of the operatic &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;), some are more muted with acoustic strumming, pianos and glockenspeils (&quot;Exit Music,&quot; &quot;No Surprises&quot;) but it's the tracks in the middle, the moderate rock songs like the absofreakinlutely fantastic &quot;Let Down,&quot; the highly underrated &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; (the title of which is obviously reminiscent of Bob Dylan) and &quot;Lucky&quot; and the slow steady vibe of &quot;The Tourist&quot; that REALLY make this album special because they make such mid-tempo rock interesting, which is where so many bands fall short.<br />You'll have to forgive me. It's hard to put the magic this record has into words because it's subtle, for sure. The album is infectious, though. Put it on, one night when you're alone, and really give it a good listen. It might entrhall you, it might scare you, but odds are it'll do something.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was hesitant at first to accept the concept of these 2 artists getting together. I always considered Rage a powerful band but more or less a one trick pony. This collaboration changed my opinion of Morello and company in a big way. Where one door closes, another one opens up. As luck would have it, the next door was Chris Cornell. Cornell is not merely another metal mutt barking out lyrics. He is a gifted songwriter in his own right with an incredible sense of melody and vocal range. This new dynamic, added to the hook and soul of the Morello crew, pump life back into the sluggish rock scene. Rage Against the Machine is no more. They have blossomed into a more focused and musically diverse unit, creating tunes that they never would have with Zach. Songs like &quot;Like a stone&quot; and &quot;I am the highway&quot; prove that. Of course, they can still lay down fat and fuzzy grooves but now with Cornell songs like &quot;Set it off&quot; and &quot;Gasoline&quot; have direction and structure.<BR>I already look forward to the next helping of Audioslave tracks. I just hope it doesn't take another 2 1/2 years to get them.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I stumbled into Sigur Ros after someone on a messageboard I frequent was expressing excitement about their then-upcoming third album ( ), which I bought the day it was released stateside. I was duly impressed, but it was after I bought Agaetis Byrjun that the band really sunk it's claws into me.<br />For an album who's songs stretch up into the the ten minute range, this is a very accessable record. The instrumentals are soothing yet intense, often at the same time (think Kid A-era Radiohead), as this is very much mood music. Pianos interweave with bowed electric guitars, fingerpicked acoustics, moderate percussion, keyboard melodies, etcetera. One song (Olsen Olsen, I believe) even has a somewhat dischordant orchestral bombast.<br />As far as the vocals, Jonsi has a beautiful falsetto (no one I play this for believes that's a guy at first), and even though I don't understand the lyrics (they are Icelandic after all), I like the tonal quality of them.<br />To a point, Vanilla Sky did for Sigur Ros what Benny &amp; Joon did for the Proclaimers: gave an unknown band stateside a few minutes in the spotlight. Given, Sven-g-Englar (which loosely translates to Sleepwalkers I think), the song on the VS soundtrack, is one you hear people going on about a lot. The standout, in my opinion however, is the title track, Agaetis Byrjun (A Good Beginning). Both are fantastic songs, though, and the rest of the album isn't much behind.<br />So yes. If you're in the mood for a three minute pop hook, obviously you would do well to look elsewhere. If you're willing to invest a little patience, however, Agaetis Byrjun is a top cut. Let it wash over you and see where it takes you.
B000000OQY|5.0|If you claim to like Rock N' Roll but don't have GN'R Lies, <BR>the only person you're fooling is yourself! The first four songs<BR>are fast paced faux live tunes from the 1986 Live Like A Suicide. The last four are more subdued and much more enterprising. Patience is the perfect \\"ballad\\", while Used To Love Her is Patience's humorously gory opposite. The Lies incarnation of You're Crazy is slower and more profane than the Appetite version. Lastly, One In A Million, the album's magnum opus. This song says it all. Expressing the feelings of \\"a small town white boy\\" OIAM lashes out at the evils of the city. If any song truly epitomizes the signifigance of Guns N' Roses, this is it. My only complaint is that Axl offered up an apology to any offended.
B000003TBP|5.0|Ever wondered what would happen if you took every popular stlye of music from the last twenty or thirty years and put them all in a blender? Probably not, but apparently Beck has, because Odelay seems to be the end result of such an experiment. Of course, only someone with a musical history like Beck could pull this off, but believe it or not, he makes it work and it works damn well.<br />How do I describe this album musically? Well, I can't really. Some songs rock hard (\\"High 5,\\" \\"Novocane,\\" \\"Devil's Haircut\\"), some have a laid back, turntable lilt to them (\\"Hotwax,\\" \\"Where It's At\\"), some are surprisingly soft and pleasant (\\"Jack-Ass,\\" \\"Ramshackle\\"),  some sound like country on acid (\\"Lord Only Knows,\\" \\"Sissyneck\\") and some are just from another planet (\\"Derelict\\"). The thing is, Mr. Hansen has his fingers in a million different pies at once on every song, which makes him really hard to nail down.<br />Lyrically, Beck is...well, Beck. His lyrics are hard to interpret, and often a little silly. He seems to have kind of a thing for pants on this album though: they're mentioned on several songs, the best one being  at the end of Lord Only Knows when he wails \\"Going back to Huston / Do the hotdog dance / Goin back to Huston / to get me some pants.\\" What more do you need me to tell you?<br />I suppose I can see where some people might find this a little tricky to digest. It's not an album that you can let wash over you before you go to sleep (at least not unless you wanna have really screwed up dreams), it's more of a party record. But it can be truly said that this album has something for everyone.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book based on Amazon.com reviews and am so glad I did.  My son is only 16 months old but he loves this book!  We read it over and over again and I do believe he is starting to understand the concept of mommy having a baby in her belly and that he will be a big brother soon.  It is so cute, the illustrations are great and the story is perfect.  I would highly recommend this book to parents preparing a child of any age for a new sibling!
B000075BFK|2.0|This year the evil record business have been making a sad,sad attempt to make money off two musical legends of the 1990'S, those two men are Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur. While Cortney Love has been making change off Cobain's Nirvana album and his PERSONAL JOURNALS, Suge Knight is making money off Tupac releases that have been on bootleg since 1997.<br />Most of the songs are the original songs. Like Until the End of Time, most of these songs were tracks Tupac thew together and never wanted to be released in the first place. Maybe there just trying to get new fans into Tupac or trying to make money off his legacy with songs that can be found on ebay with Makaveli(2,3,4,5 and 7).<br />Nas on a Tupac song? Please. This is just as worst as Biggies Born Again.<br />Don't buy this if your just getting into Tupac, pick up All Eyez On Me and The 7 Day Theory. If your a die-hard Pac fan, and dont own the bootlegs, I guess its worth a shot.
B000002H97|4.0|While this album has its graces, this is where Metallica turned to mainstream rock rather than the fast-paced heavy metal that they were known for (again, I use the word &quot;sell outs.&quot;).  HOWEVER, this album gets a lot of flack for it being the &quot;commercial album&quot; when it is certainly not a bad album.  In fact, this is their last good album.  &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; &quot;Nothing Else Matters,&quot; &quot;Wherever I May Roam,&quot; and &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot; (my favorite here) are excellent songs.  All the other songs are either ok (like &quot;Unforgiven&quot;) or just plain blah (I really disliked &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; and &quot;Sad But True&quot;).  In short, while it may sound closer to commercial rock than to heavy metal, give it a listen and you'll find some good music here.  So what if it's not Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?
B00006CXXU|4.0|I didn't want to buy this album at first, because Christina's appearance as of late was a little too dirrty for me and over the top.  Just think of the outfit she wore to the MTV awards.  I thought that Dirrty was an alright song, but not one worth buying the cd for.  Then I heard Beautiful.  That is such a great song.  Very uplifting and a good message...I listen to it every day.  The album is very much about Christina and things that have happened to her in life.  The songs hit very close to home for me...trouble in relationships, needing to be a strong woman, realizing beauty.  The message in her cd is very powerful and good for any girl to listen to.
B00005JLRR|3.0|After the lacking \\"Insurrection,\\" fans would wait an abnormally long four years before the tenth installment came to be.  With Rick Berman still producing, he would select John Logan, acclaimed screenwriter of \\"Gladiator\\" (and Brent Spiner's friend), to write the screenplay which would feature the Romulans as the adversary.  However, due to the debacle in the previous film, Jonathan Frakes declined to direct.  In his place would be Stuart Baird, veteran editor of many films and director of \\"Executive Decision\\" and \\"U.S. Marshals.\\"<br />Would this be the film that fans waited so long for?  My personal opinion is rather mixed.  John Logan's script certainly has a lot of heart (in fact, some of the best scenes from his script were edited out for time constraints).  The major problem for me was the ending.  Data's death was rather unemotional and uninteresting.  It even paled in comparison to Captain Kirk's death in \\"Generations,\\" and THAT was a poor way for a character to go out.  Also, I felt the goodbye scene between Picard and Riker was unemotional as well.  These guys have known each other for over 15 years and all they do is say \\"It's been a pleasure serving with you.\\"  Nothing else.<br />I really do think they should've chosen a different director.  I was never a fan of Stuart Baird's style of directing.  Nicholas Meyer, Jonathan Frakes, Leonard Nimoy, even David Carson could've directed this with a little more flair.  Baird directs it as an action film, nothing more.<br />On the plus side, the humor and camaradarie between the characters is well done.  Lots of people complained about bad dialogue but I really didn't think the majority of it was.  The acting was also quite good (especially Ron Perlman as the Viceroy, he is the man!).  There's a real sense of \\"old Trekness\\" that this film possesses.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is also good (although he could've made it a little better).  It resembles \\"Logan's Run\\" and other older sci-fi films.<br />Overall, this film is a definite mixed package.  Since this might be the last Trek TNG film, I felt like the makers and cast didn't take a chance in making this great.  Baird is an action director, nothing more.  Goldsmith produced no new musical themes.  The Romulans are never really explored here.  And finally, Data's death didn't make a definite impact (even less so because of B4, the android double).  All in all, not a terrible film... it's just not great.  I do place it higher than \\"Generations\\" and \\"Insurrection,\\" though.is a definite mixed package.

B000075BFK|3.0|I've purchased this cd and it was worth it, could've been better, don't think 2Pac would have rapped to 3/4 of the tracks on this album, A lot of it sounds like stuff he didn't even want and that's why it was never released, but I wanna know why didn't the producer of Ghetto Star do more tracks????(since this seems to be one of the nicest tracks), But since I'm a Pac fan, his lyrics was worth buying the album.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is so good.  Its thrilling, its full of action, and it has a point.  If you want a movie that'll make you think, watch this.
0451191153|5.0|Unbelievable, superb! The author depicts characters which not only intrigue but depict the extremes in society. I do not believe that Ayn Rand was an extremist; it is through her extremist characters in the novel that Rand describes objectivism, the goal towards ego and capitalism, as not 'evil'.<br />It is man's desire to achieve a goal using all instruments at his/her disposal which promotes improvements or degradation to society as a whole.<br />Toohey as a character was resolute in his goal for power and it was this determinedness which allowed him to obtain his strength and manipulate people. Ayn relates the methods used to stifle the soul of man and kill the spirit.<br />Howard Roark strives for a 'quality' in architecture which many attempt to destroy (even unknowingly). Roark's glory is achieved in the doing and the finality of the work. The achievement when completing his works alters the architectural and imaginative ideas of others.<br />I highly recommend this novel to all the philosophically minded readers. Whether or not you agree with the author, the ideas will have you thinking.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Probably one of the best Hip Hop albums of all time.   A definate classic.  Everyone who appreciates real hip hop ought to have this in their collection.  Intelligent lyricism (that's why he's known as &quot;The Genius&quot;), dope beats, and great Kung Fu sound clips make this a must for real hip hop headz.
B000070WJE|2.0|In comparison to his other albums, escapology is truly not his best album. I am disapointed that I actually wasted my money buying this album, its a complete waste. These songs are nothing compared to the songs -Supreme,Millenium,Let love be your energy.<BR>So if you are a big fan of robbie, go ahead buy it but keep the bill ready cause you are gona exchange it.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|The sound that T.A.T.U. has is very interesting, and while their image is being marketed to overly-hormonal straight teenage boys, their message is great, even if ignored, and something to be paid attention to by all people.<BR>I'm saddened by the way they're being portrayed and reviewed. Being lesbian is not something to &quot;turn on&quot; the boys. It is not something to sell their music. It is the way they are, and making music about it is no more remarkable than any of the hundreds of artists making songs about heterosexual love.<BR>The album is awesome - but buy it for the right reasons.
1878424319|5.0|This book is one of my all-time favorites. I just bought it for everyone on my holiday gift list. Ruiz has done a terrific job at showing us how to appreciate ourselves through the Four Agreements.
B00005JL96|4.0|Super-cute movie!!  My daughter is 5 1/2 and we loved this movie. I might have liked it more than she did, actually.  The story is about an alien created simply to destroy things, without any other purpose in this world, who ends up on Earth-mistaken for a dog-and adopted by Lilo. Lilo is adorable. She is not all sappy-sappy like some other animated characters created. She is fresh and spunky.  Anyway, Lilo lives with her sister and they are having a rough time without any parents to guide them.  Stitch comes along and adds a lot of excitement to their lives. The storyline is such that an entire family can enjoy it. The humor appeals to many different ages, and the animation is exceptional. Good movie for adults and kids.
0553579908|2.0|There are many twists and turns in this book.  Unfortunately, it is done in a boring way.  The twists are generally so ridiculous that I laughed, even though they are all supposed to be grim.  It's a dark novel, but its so campy and silly that I just can't take it seriously or get into as much as other authors.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is one of my favorite artists.  I would recomend it to just about everyone.  THe lyrics are creative and the music is excellent.  My favorite track is My World.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Luckily I caught this movie when the HBO station bled over on to my cable station. I'm so glad I did not spend one cent on this travesty. Very depressing, with a plot line almost as slow as a legless turtle, the story plods along to another little Stevie syrupy obession with MOM ending. Time to grow up, Stevie, you're past senior citizen age!<BR> <BR>Most of the movie seemed to be a bunch of personal dream sequences strung together. Dreams may mean everything to the person who has them,but they don't mean much to the rest of us. <BR>Spielberg has become too rich and famous and, like all before him, is drying out creatively. Even composer John Williams, who I have adored for decades, seemed uninspired by this useless movie. I don't expect much more in the &quot;wow&quot; department from Spielberg anymore.
B00006IU73|5.0|That a brilliantly executed piece of rock music that is In Ansentia will never be heard except by those of us who are prog- minded anyway is a damned shame. Steve Wilson's opus is in places searingly hot and in others melodically gorgeous. For all of their many years of sins, record execs and radio station programmers should be locked away in solitary confinement for a long time and be exposed to PT, Flower Kings, new Yes, etc.
B000069AUI|2.0|It keeps amazing me how sometimes people just don't have a real taste in music and think this is some of the best music you can get. Well, let me tell you it's not. I thought 'Parachutes' was a very good album, it contained quite a few gorgeous songs ('Don't Panic', 'Spies', 'High Speed') so my expectations for this album were pretty high. After hearing the first single from this album, 'In My Place', I was already utterly dissapointed. What a boring, safe-sounding pile of nothingness that song is. Indeed, emotionless, aiming to please people who just want to have some CD's to play in the car while driving to work. The worst thing is: this whole album sounds like the single. Mid-tempo, flat melodies, extremely bland lyrics. Nothing jumps out. It's elevator-music in a pop-disguise. I've listened to this thing quite a lot but it didn't succeed to get to me for just one little bit. Why don't I give it 1 star then? Well, it's always better than the trash that's in the charts these days (Enrique Iglesias, Britney Spears), so that would be unfair. Whats also unfair is that this album gets such a ridiculous amount of attention. Now Coldplay is the new superband; they're being hailed as the new U2 or something. Fine with me; I'm done with them. If you want to hear a really really great pop-record that Coldplay would be jealous of; I'd say listen to The Shins' 'Oh, Inverted World'. It'll make you wonder why you even bothered with Coldplay boring 2nd album in the first place. There's a lot of unheard, great music out there people. Remember that and go look for it; it'll be so rewarding.
B00007BH5C|5.0|As with Howard Shore's score for &quot;Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; this is a score that needs to be heard more than once for its richness to reveal itself. I have now listened to it for several nights in a row, and keep uncovering more complexity and texture. I can hardly wait to see how it matches up with the screen images, because, there again, the first score really showed its full power where it was meant to be heard, with the film. However, I think the second, despite its epic quality, is almost more suited to home listening than the first, and flows like a very powerful tone poem. There are moments of haunting beauty and awe-inspiring grandeur. And &quot;Gollum's Song,&quot; at first rather a shock compared to the gentle boy soprano that ends the first film, becomes as wierdly fascinating as the character that inspires it (no, Gollum does not sing). There are just enough familiar passages to tie it in with the first score, and enough differences to make us aware that we are in new terrain and moving toward something even more powerful. This is indeed an operatic score in its sweep and passion.
B000001FXT|5.0|This is one of the very best of Bob Marley and The Wailers' (the first two were originally released under the group name The Wailers) original 11 Island-era albums. Definitely. (Survival and Exodus are probably the two best.) I own all of these albums on CD and vinyl, and my Marley collection in general is very, very extensive. SURVIVAL is so good that if I had to suggest three releases which include material released during the Island Era, they would be Songs of Freedom (the 4-CD career retrospective box set), Legend, and SURVIVAL. It is so good that seven of the songs from this album are on Songs of Freedom, (for one of them they put the 12&quot; mix instead of the original), and there is an additional dub version of one of these songs on the SOF box set. It is such a good album, that if you consider yourself a fan of Island-era Marley, I guarantee that if you do not have this album already and you buy it, you will like it. &quot;Zimbabwe,&quot; &quot;Babylon System,&quot; &quot;Africa Unite,&quot; &quot;One Drop,&quot; &quot;Ride Natty Ride,&quot; and &quot;Ambush in the Night&quot; are unstoppably awesome songs!! Just as &quot;No Woman, No Cry [Lyceum, 1975]&quot; is Marley's best LIVE recording, &quot;Africa Unite&quot; is arguably Marley's best Island-era STUDIO recording. It's very beautiful and deep. &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; may be the most important song Marley ever recorded. READ THE WORDS from the liner notes AS YOU LISTEN TO THE SONG! BM&amp;tW were invited to play at the celebration of the opening of the independent country of Zimbabwe in 1980(, at which the people knew the words to this song better than the words of their own new national anthem)! What an honor! They were the only non-African-based musical group that played for the celebration. I have heard SO MANY Marley songs, and this is my favorite Bob Marley song! &quot;Babylon System&quot; is also beautiful and deep, including one unforgettable line which you will discover upon hearing it. &quot;OneDrop&quot; is almost unbelievably beautiful. You will melt when you hear it. &quot;Ambush&quot; did not make it onto SOF, but is beautiful and deep. Then you have &quot;So Much Trouble in the World,&quot; and &quot;Survival,&quot; which have great lyrics, So Much is also quite rhythmic. &quot;Top Rankin&quot; also has great lyrics. Even the arguably weakest song on the album, &quot;Wake Up and Live,&quot; has great lyrics.<BR>&quot;Africa Unite-Ambush&quot; could be a candidate for the best four songs in a row on any original album, of all time. I own about 32 or 33 copies of SURVIVAL on vinyl, including all four original colored vinyl editions pressed only in Jamaica in 1979 [according to Catch a Fire biography]. By the way, if you own the SOF boxset, that contains the &quot;bonus track,&quot; the 12&quot; mix of Ride Natty Ride, which was put on the remastered version of SURVIVAL, so you would only need to get the old 10-track TUFF GONG version of SURVIVAL (although it is currently becoming increasingly difficult to get a still-sealed copy of the ten-track verszion of the CD). The 12&quot; mix is a bit more rhythmic, as might be expected of a 12&quot; mix supposedly intended for the dancefloor, but the original version is already a great song that needed no help.
B000002AS3|5.0|...bottom line, this is one of the finest rock n' roll albums I've ever heard.  Noel Gallagher has put the blues back into hard rock like i've never heard before, especially on Rhythm Guitar, which he wrote for them...Of course Liam sounds cool, no one wants to go to a concert and here Noel sing...so here it is, believe all the junk people say about Oasis over here, or be offended by these loudmouths, but let me tell you man, you are missing out on one of the best rock n' roll records ever...this is the best, flat out, rock out, who cares, rock n' roll out there...if you don't like this album, go listen to hip hop or opera or some [thing else]...this album is a rock n' roll mecca...not many disagree about Oasis' first album, they were still raw, young, and edgy...before they opened their mouths and said the funniest and rudest things i've ever heard in public...you gotta like these guys for just not caring...
B00005MKA3|5.0|This is one of the very best of Bob Marley and The Wailers' (the first two were originally released under the group name The Wailers) original 11 Island-era albums. Definitely. (Survival and Exodus are probably the two best.) I own all of these albums on CD and vinyl, and my Marley collection in general is very, very extensive. It is so good that if I had to suggest three releases which include material released during the Island Era, they would be Songs of Freedom (the 4-CD career retrospective box set), Legend, and SURVIVAL. It is so good that seven of the songs from this album are on Songs of Freedom, (for one of them they put the 12&quot; mix instead of the original), and there is an additional dub version of one of these songs on the SOF box set. It is such a good album, that if you consider yourself a fan of Island-era Marley, I guarantee that if you do not have this album already and you buy it, you will like it. &quot;Zimbabwe,&quot; &quot;Babylon System,&quot; &quot;Africa Unite,&quot; &quot;One Drop,&quot; &quot;Ride Natty Ride,&quot; and &quot;Ambush in the Night&quot; are unstoppably awesome songs!! Just as &quot;No Woman, No Cry [Lyceum, 1975]&quot; is Marley's best LIVE recording, &quot;Africa Unite&quot; is arguably Marley's best Island-era STUDIO recording. It's very beautiful and deep. &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; may be the most important song Marley ever recorded. READ THE WORDS from the liner notes AS YOU LISTEN TO THE SONG! BM&amp;tW were invited to play at the celebration of the opening of the independent country of Zimbabwe in 1980(, at which the people knew the words to this song better than the words of their own new national anthem)! What an honor! They were the only non-African-based musical group that played for the celebration. I have heard SO MANY Marley songs, and this is my favorite Bob Marley song! &quot;Babylon System&quot; is also beautiful and deep, including one unforgettable line which you will discover upon hearing it. &quot;One Drop&quot; is almost unbelievably beautiful. You will melt when you hear it. &quot;Ambush&quot; did not make it onto SOF, but is beautiful and deep. Then you have &quot;So Much Trouble in the World,&quot; and &quot;Survival,&quot; which have great lyrics, So Much is also quite rhythmic. &quot;Top Rankin&quot; also has great lyrics. Even the arguably weakest song on the album, &quot;Wake Up and Live,&quot; has great lyrics.<BR>&quot;Africa Unite-Ambush&quot; could be a candidate for the best four songs in a row on any original album, of all time. I own about 32 or 33 copies of SURVIVAL on vinyl, including all four original colored vinyl editions pressed only in Jamaica in 1979 [according to Catch a Fire biography]. By the way, if you own the SOF boxset, that contains the &quot;bonus track,&quot; the 12&quot; mix of Ride Natty Ride, which was put on the remastered version of SURVIVAL, so you would only need to get the old 10-track TUFF GONG version of SURVIVAL (although it is currently becoming increasingly difficult to get a still-sealed copy of the ten-track version of the CD). The 12&quot; mix is a bit more rhythmic, as might be expected of a 12&quot; mix supposedly intended for the dancefloor, but the original version is already a great song that needed no help.
B000059HAI|5.0|This is a movie for history buffs as well as for those that just like a good movie.  It depicts Pearl Harbor with an ensemble cast, cohesive storytelling, effective special effects (even by today's standards), great cinematography, and excellent film editing.  The lack of romance and other sub-plots enhances the drama and tension of the event.  This is history at its finest, wrapped in storytelling as only Hollywood can do.<br />On December 7, 1941, 350 aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy, in two waves, conducted a surprise attack on the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Island, Oahu, Hawaii Islands.  While more successful than could have been reasonably expected (who could have known that it really would take the Americans completely by surprise?), it still fell short of being decisive.  The Pacific Fleet was devastated in a single air battle that lasted a bit under two hours.  In that short time the US lost 21 ships sunk or damaged out of the 90 or so that were at anchor in or near the harbor, or under way near the harbor.  This included all 8 battleships assigned to the Fleet.  Three of these, the West Virginia, the Oklahoma, and Arizona were sunk.  The West Virginia was later raised and returned to duty.  Most of the other vessels, including the other 5 battleships, were eventually repaired as well.  In addition to ship losses, 188 US aircraft were destroyed and another 159 damaged.  Although totals vary, some reports carry human losses at 2,403 dead (including 68 civilians) and 1,178 wounded (including 35 civilians).  No matter what the precise totals, they were high.<br />For all of this damage, it's important to understand what the Japanese missed.  Neither of the two Pacific Fleet carriers (Enterprise and Lexington) was in or near port that day, so they were unscathed.  Missing the carriers ultimately would prove grievous to Japanese strategy.  Moreover, a third wave scheduled to hit harbor installations, repair facilities, warehouses, and fuel dumps on Oahu wascancelled.<br />The story of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor cannot be told effectively without providing background on why and how it came to be, and the movie does just that.  The attack was rooted in the effect the Great Depression had on Japan's economy, which stimulated their desire to control the natural resources needed to fuel their economy; Japanese militant expansionism, which put them on a collision course with the US; and Japanese military culture and tradition, which made them willing to take on a world power significantly their superior and which also believed in initiating hostilities by sudden, overwhelming attack; and the war Europe.  <br />There were many in the Imperial Japanese Navy that understood the fearsomeness of what they were getting into.  Ironically, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Sô Yamamura), the mastermind of the strategy to strike the American fleet at Pearl felt this way.<br />The movie pointed out that the Japanese diplomatic ultimatum was not presented until after the attack started and points to this as one of the reasons behind the massive US public embitterment after the attack.  Hence, Admiral Yamamoto's doleful warning (and the most memorable line from the movie), &quot;I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;  (The second most memorable line is by an old man fishing while warplanes are practicing their low-level runs, &quot;Navy pilots attract geisha girls, but they frighten the fish.&quot;  It's the same all over, I guess.)<br />While it doesn't delve into all of the geopolitical issues as much as it could, it does provide an understanding of the events that led up to the attack and the devastation it caused, with an even-handedness that is refreshing.  This starts from the very beginning of the movie where the credits are alternated between the American cast and film crew and the Japanese, and continues throughout the movie as scenes shift back and forth between the Japanese and American perspectives.<br />Particularly effective is how the movie builds tension as the Japanese plan is put into action, alternating between the Japanese strike force and the Americans.  The Japanese fleet sails determinedly through the stormy northern Pacific while the American intelligence staff at the War Department in Washington becomes increasingly frustrated as they attempt to raise the alarm.  The Americans' misguided posture is juxtaposed with the almost youthful exuberance of the Japanese flight crews and maintenance teams as they continue their training and preparation shipboard.  Their enthusiasm is contrasted with the solemnity of their Shinto prayer and the tension of their senior officers.  The tension mounts as the director employs the Gettysburg-esque technique of using maps to show the fleet's progress toward the Islands.  It culminates in the dawn launch, with engine exhausts aflame, large formations of planes circling overhead as they form up before departing for the final air leg to their target, and the unsuspecting, unconcerned American fleet awakening on a lazy, sunny December morning in Hawaii, feeling safe.<br />If there is any noteworthy failing, it is that the move fails to depict the pathos of war - the overwhelming of the base (and presumably the civilian) medical facilities, the pain and suffering of incapacitating injuries, the civilian casualties, the mass of dead, injured, and struggling men in the water, the frantic attempts to escape by men trapped below decks in sunken and overturned ships.<br />While it provides an excellent history lesson, the movie also has the look and feel of a good story.  The story it tells is two-fold.  It tells of the misguided desperation of the Japanese that led them to take on the United States (if their post-war success is any standard for comparison).  It also speaks to America's arrogance in 1941.  We knew Japan was dangerous, but didn't expect them to come at us the way they did.  Our belief in ourselves got in our way.  In the end the American deaths at Pearl Harbor resulted from the failure of our imagination.  We just didn't think this attack would happen.
B000026C3T|5.0|This is definately a must have for any fan of Led Zeppelin.  It is also a good start for people who have not listened to them before.  This collection has all the greatest hits like Communication Breakdown, Dazed And Confused, Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, Ramble On, Immigrant Song, Black Dog, The Battle Of Evermore and Stairway To Heaven.  The second cd has great songs but none seem to stand out like those on first.  The best song has to be Staiirway but the second best is The Battle Of Evermore because it is a great song and it has mentions of The Lord of the Rings in it.  Buy this collection whether you are fans or new fans of Zeppelin.
0312979479|5.0|Ten people are summoned by letter to Indian Island off the  Devon coast. All are accused by a voice on a gramaphone recording of murder, all crimes which for one reason or another  escaped punishment by the law. They are trapped on the island and since this is a Christie novel the murders begin and with a vengeance. There are little indian figurines in the house, each time someone is killed a little indian<br />figure, yes there are ten of them, disappears.<br /> Every murder follows, in order,<br />the nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\", which reads:<br /><br />Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;<br />One choked his little self and then there were nine.<br />Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;<br />One overslept himself and then there were eight.<br />Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon;<br />One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.<br />Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks;<br />One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.<br />Six little Indian boys playing with a hive;<br />A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.<br />Five little Indian boys going in for law;<br />One got in Chancery and then there were four.<br />Four little Indian boys going out to sea;<br />A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.<br />Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo;<br />A big bear hugged one and then there were two.<br />Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun;<br />One got frizzled up and then there was one.<br />One little Indian boy left all alone;<br />He went and hanged himself and then there were none.<br />This classic novel vibrates with themes of guilt, conscience, and justice. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is one of the strongest mysteries in the genre.
B00000JNO2|5.0|This is one of the strongest Skynyrd cd's that I have heard.  Pronounced and Second Helping are the only two Skynyrd cd's that are better.  The cd has only great tracs, nothing weak on this cd.  The best songs are Bullets, Trust, Mothers Son, All I Can Do, Bad Man.  The other tracks are good but those are the ones that stand out.  Buy it if you are a Skynyrd fan.
0563214546|2.0|This book is not what I expected. In my view, a great cookbook is one that manages to distinct itself from the crowd. None of this is evident here. This book is too wordy, not easy to follow or to search for receipts, basic cooking methods are not covered - just the more sophisticated cooking combinations with multiple ingredients, there are not enough pictures of the ready receipts or how to prepare them (don't be fooled by illustrated - this book is thin on images) and the receipts are rarely inspiring.<br />What is nice about this book is the fluent english of the author that makes a good reading - but if you're looking for a good cookbook - look elsewhere.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Anyone purchasing this album thinking its an attempt to bring back the past is in for a rude awakining! The opening song Pychotic Break sounds somewhat Alice like, maybe it was intended to be that way, but from there on out, be surprised!<BR>Like Degridation trip (the origional), the lyrics are ironic when you consider they were wrote before Layne passed, but shows respect to those he worked with.<BR>Jerry's voice is melodic and clean. His guitar playing is as strong as it ever was if not stronger and his song writing is amongst the best out there.<BR>No other artist from the late 80's - 90's who has tried to make it solo has held as true to what the return of real rock was about, especially in a decade when it seems like you have to scream, rap or be plain silly to make it.<BR>Roadrunner records should be commended for believing in one of the greatest artist ever.
B000002NJS|4.0|Madonna has never really proven herself as a capable producer, as this album clearly demonstrates. Ray of Light is bogged down by muddy production, only twice (on the beautiful ballad &quot;Frozen&quot; and the techno-inspired &quot;Skin&quot;) reaching a level of ambient greatness. The album also suffers from rather cliched and predictable lyrics (most notably on &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;). Nevertheless, Madonna still manages to create several captivating moments. The meditative opener &quot;Drowned World&quot;, for example, or the swirling title cut. The album's highlight, however, is the dazzling six and a half minute album track &quot;Skin&quot;. Madonna's fantastically ambiguous lyrics make this song one of her most provocative. Overall, despite it's flaws, Ray of Light is an above average, satisfying pop album, light years ahead of most other mainstream pop music.
B00005JLRR|1.0|The biggest Nemesis here is that Trek has been around so long that is lost steam.  Granted the production value of this film is far greater than Final Frontier, or Generations. Ans it was well-written enough that I wasn't physically cringing in the theater the was I was when I saw Insurrection. However, this film was total bore.  Only go to see it if you are willing to snooze through a slow-moving, aimless feeling movie that produces no excitment, suprises or emotion. It essentially just relies on the usual Trek trick of recycling old Trek plots and plot devices. This film is a total \\"clone\\" of Star Trek II,  however as we have all learned from science fiction, the clone is never as good as the original.  If you really want to see a good Star Trek film, see Star Trek II, the Wrath of Khan.  This film was just a lame re-make of that awesome flick. I guess the Trek writers have just run out of ideas and are not excited about the franchise anymore.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Only if you REALLY like Bob Marley, but if you do, this is utterly essential. The songs (many of the versions are unavailable anywhere else) are presented in chronological order, so you can stack them into your player, sit down for four hours, and listen to a brand-new musical form evolve.<br />I bought it for his later, rockier stuff, but I've come to really love the amazing close harmonies on the early songs on disc 1. \\"Bus Dem Shut\\" is incandescent.<br />But there's also lots of his later, rockier \\"big doobie\\" stuff, most of it in live or alternate versions. The songs sound like anthems these days. The live \\"No Woman No Cry\\"...<br />A big added bonus is the book. Caveat: I have the original, much-coveted \\"long-jacket\\" version of this collection, so I don't know if the book is still readable in the jewel-box release, but it actually gives a fairly complete, accurate history of the man, and lots of wonderful photographs.<br />JAH! RAS TAFARI! If your hair is long and spirals down, your life is not complete without this collection.
0312305060|3.0|This is a book comprised of 3 novellas, each linked in some way to the novel Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf.  In fact, one of the novellas is an account of the novelist herself at the time she is writing Mrs. Dalloway.  This novella has the greatest potential, since the relationship between protagonist and novelist runs in both directions:  the protagonist reflects the novelist's current circumstances and emotional life, but also acts on Woolf's emotions and decision making.  The three novellas are structurally interwoven with alternating chapters.  Like some TV shows, however, this structure seems more useful in hiding the weakness of each novella than  in elucidating meanings and insights.  The novella about the novelist is not cohesive, although it has some strong imagery; the novella about an unhappy reader of the novel has little to it, and the novella about an editor with the nickname Dalloway is touching at times, but exploitive.  Perhaps my problem is that I never read the Woolf novel.  The book is short enough and interesting enough that you may want to read it before seeing the film, which is supposed to be good.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a monument to music! From the quaint, folk-like Concerning Hobbits to the heavy, operatic Shadow of the Past, black Rider, and Bridge of Khazad Dum, it is all so spellbinding. Enya's haunting songs Aniron and May it Be are among her most beautiful. May it Be has some very deep meanings for me, especially in the lyrics. It is all so wonderful; joy, anger, love, compassion, and sadness root themselves in this score. You won't be dissapointed by this masterpiece!
0425152251|5.0|Sophie's Welt is a novel approach to what has long been a decidedly academic realm of thought: philosophy.  It is, as the titles states, a novel about the history of philosophical investigation.  This is the first novel by Norwegian professor Jostein Gaarder, who has since quit his profession as a teacher and today reaches a larger, global audience through his novels. <br />15-year old Sofie Amundson receives a letter in the mail from an unknown man and embarks on a journey through centuries of philosophical inquiry in the form of what is almost a correspondence course.  To tell more about the plot would be to ruin the entire book for new readers, so I will leave it at that.  Be careful when reading other reviews that may not be so considerate!<br />I recommend it especially to young people who are first beginning to question the human condition and the universe, but readers of all ages can enjoy the unexpected plot twists and manipulations.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is THE production of Les Mis!     It is beautiful, dramatic and heartbreaking! Ruthie Henshall IS Fantine! She has a very strong and yet very vulnerable voice! Her character often parallels to poor young women who are financialy in peril and desperate for better lives, especially if they have children. her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream could make a stone weep. Michael Ball has a similar voice; powerful and emotive and yet gentle and soft. He is perfect as Marius!     When paired with Lea Salonga as Eponine, you really want him to forget Cosette and fall in love with Eponine!    In My Life, Miss Salonga produces a strong, bitter voice, much like Eponine, but then goes soft and vulnerable, which really shows off the other side of Eponine.         A Heart Full of Love is another beauty! After Cosette sings \\"I am found\\" to Marius, you can just see Eponines shattered expression as she gazes through the gate at Marius, and when she sings \\"these are words he'll never say! Not to me! etc.\\" it's just heartwrenching. She then goes on to pain us again in On My Own, and she does again one last time (with Marius)in A Little Fall of Rain (pack tissues if you get misty-eyed easily!).     Drink With Me is a quiet but highly emotional piece. Listening to it, and especially to the lyrics, makes you think about everyone who has died in a war. Colm Wilkinson also conjured up that feeling with Bring Him Home. The way he sings it sends chills down your back, and just a few seconds into it and tears will already be streaming down your face! This is my mother's favorite part; it reminds her that parents would rather let anything happen to themselves, rather than bear the thought of losing their children.        On the whole, this is a brilliant production! The innkeeper and his wife are SO funny! I love the way she says \\"thinks he's quite a lover but (mouths) theres not much there!\\" in Master of The House! It's SO hilarious!
B00005JLRR|5.0|This one is not to be missed!...  As exciting as Wrath of Khan!!  This was a wonderful installment and I sure hope they find a way to keep on making more films together~~~
6302794331|5.0|Sure, the muppets mixed in with a Christmas classic it does sound sort of strange, but it works out beautifully! While this story is warped into too many emotionally sterile versions(like Scrooge, in the seventies or so, Mrs. Cratchet wasn't even mourning Tiny Tim! Albert Finney Could NOT act and the music, most of it, was terrible!)this one really focuses on the humanity of the story and characters. Human emotions were finally shown! Michael Caine was excellent as Scrooge. The love between him and Belle was really believable(when he joins her at the end of her song, you can tell he has repeated her parting words ever since; he MUST have loved her!). Emily Cratchet was finally mourning her son(more realistic), and Bob Cratchet's speech about being parted from a loved one is a fact of life is one of the most touching moments. The score to the movie, why didn't they make a soundtrack?! They each tie into their scenes so well that if they were removed, it would just be missing something; When Love is Gone\\" is one of the saddest, most beautiful love ballads I've ever heard and its sequence is equally heartbreaking; no wonder Scrooge (and Rizzo)was crying when Belle left, he must have loved Belle very much and seeing it happen again...it would break the hardest heart, it did with me, and I'm 17 and hardened through and through, although I do care about others! I just can't go past that scene; its too much! This movie is just SO touching! I highly recommend it!
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel flat out knows how to write a pop song and it is a shame he has given it up.  These 2 CD's represent the best of his career sans - Storm Front album.  As one reviewer said, his singles are more well known and received than his uneven albums.  This CD is a perfect hits collection surmising his most popular hits while throwing in some unknown surprises (Say Goodbye to Hollywood, Captain Jack, and Don't Ask Me Why.  His recent concerts only emphasize the fact that he is quite a talent and I look forward to his next pop album.  One of my favorite CD's.  A great buy!!
B00000IL1K|5.0|This follow-up to timeless has(not surprisingly) been a huge success! The music nymph Sarah Brightman never ceases to haunt me with that beautiful siren voice of hers. This album is truely a sensation.    In Paridisum- the soft, dark, pastoral, new-age touch is very evocative and very relaxing. One cannot help but to be overcome by the haunting, ethereal sound of Sarah's voice and the music.    Bailero- Lovely! You feel yourself walking in the sunshine in the French countryside!    Dust in the Wind- A wonderful, theatrical piece and the lyrics have very profound meaning.    Il Mio Cuore Va- A stunning interpretation of My Heart Will Go On! With the adapted Italian lyrics, and Sarah's gradual move from her \\"little-girl\\" pop voice at the beginning to her operatic soprano at the last verse, the song takes on a very different feeling. Love songs are much more romantic when you can't really understand what the lyrics mean, in my opinion.    Un Jour Viendra- lovely French song that alternates pop and opera.    Only an Ocean Away- A very epic love song! This ballad has a lot of pop instruments but still sounds nice. And it has the perfect amount of drama!    Scene d'amour- This is so, so beautiful! Relaxing, intimate, quiet, but deeply emotional and romantic, this is perfect for accompanying a romantic interlude.    Nessun Dorma- VINCERO!!! This was amazing!!! This aria composed for a tenor works splendidly for a soprano! I saw Sarah's La Luna concert and the way she staged Nessun Dorma was BREATHTAKING!!!!!! Fantastico!!!    The Last Words You Said To Me- A soft, quiet, and very romantic duet!    The whole recording is an escape to Eden! Marvelous!
B00005JLRR|4.0|If you are looking for an epical film you will be dissapointed (Try the Two Towers).<br />I saw the movie the other day and it was not that bad. But this film looks basically much like a two hour star trek special you would see on TV, but that is not a bad thing. But I really hoped that they would make an epical film. Plus if you did not watch the Tv series then you will hate this movie.<br />CAUTION SPOILERS<br />One more thing the way this movie ended shocked me. It is worth a look<br />SPOILERS END<br />So if you are a Star Trek Fan than you will like this film if you are not a fan then you will hate this film.<br />Hopes this review helped
B000001GBJ|5.0|Never have I heard so enchanting and relaxing a piece as this. Fionnuala Sherry's violin playing sounds soooo sweet! Rolf Lovland's compsition and piano playing are musical genius! The lovely, pure voice of Gunnhilde Tvinnereim graces the musical strains of Nocturne, where you picture misty sea cliffs off of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Norway and all of Scandinavia.  <br /> <br />Sigma, with Rhonan Sugrue's beautiful(then)soprano voice backed by the Irish National Choir and Fionnuala's delicate violin playing, is like a walk in the forest, with rays of sunshine seeping through the leaves, in other words, heavenly.  <br /> <br />Papillon sounds so delicate, so butterfly-like, that you wonder who could have come up with such a melody. You picture butterflys flying over a sunny meadow, filled with wildflowers, and a crystal-blue brook.  <br /> <br />Serenade to spring, small wonder some say they have chosen it for weddings; it sounds so much like wedding music!  <br /> <br />Heartstrings, now THAT is emotional! Quiet, but with deep tones of emotion and yearning, this piece shows the pain of missing a loved one and how badly you want them with you.  <br /> <br />Rolf, Fionnuala, you are musical geniuses. There is too much violence, hatred, and obscenities in this world and too little beauty, peace, spiritual renewal(this is really spiritual music; its great for meditating) and so forth; this music is a gift to ease that trouble. So turn off the lights, lay back in bed, close your eyes, and let the music carry you away, or for l'amour, turn the lights off, light some candles, and curl up with a loved one. This is truely a treasure!
B00006CXXU|5.0|So, here she is again. Now, with a seventy-something minute long album. If there's one word that does not describe this cd at all, then that would be \\"homogenic\\". The variety of styles and moods of the cd is astonishing.<BR>Despite this, Christina shows she can handle most of it really well.<br />1- Stripped intro : This is obviously a introduction to the album, where she states that you would meet the real her.<BR>2- Can't hold us down ( featuring Lil' Kim): Kind of a girl-power anthem mainly about how guys can have many girls and get away with it while the girl gets named. It's a hip-hop song, which I really like, though the lyrics do get a bit repetitive. 8.5/10<BR>3- Walk away :Someone is hurting you and still you can't walk away. It's a piano ballad. Christina's voice sounds great. 10/10<BR>4- Fighter : She gets rockier, with an edgier sound. The guitars on it are excellent. It's got a catchy chorus.<BR>Very likely to be a single. 9.5/10<BR>5- Primer amor ( interlude ): Spoken interlude in Spanish. In English it would be something like: \\" I will tell you a story of how a Puerto Rican stole my heart. Never again I  loved in that way, may be I never will. It's the story of my first love. He was handsome, with deep big brown eyes. A dancer. We lost ourselves in the rhythm of love...and that's how it started... \\"<BR>6- Infatuation: The previous interlude tell us what this song is about. It's a \\"La isla Bonita\\" meets \\"Mi chico latino\\". It's in English, but with a great Latin feel and Spanish words here and there. 10/10<BR>7- Love embraces me ( interlude): This is so Mariah! . If I wouldn't known this is a Christina album, then I would think this was taken from \\"Butterfly\\".<BR>8- Loving me 4 me: This is as well a Carey's clon. The way she sings and lyrics are identical. 8/10<BR>9- Impossible: This is arranged, written and composed by Alicia keys...so guess what it sounds like? Yep, you guessed!. 8.5/10<BR>10- Underappreciated: The big voices in the chorus give it a gospel feel. It's good, just not the strongest track. 7/10<BR>11- Beautiful: This  one is excellent. Simple lyrics, beautiful music and great singing. Simply, a beautiful song. 10/10<BR>12- Make over: Ok, here's the bad apple. Starts off with a flamenco beat and then it's higher than high shouting in the chorus. Kind of a rock feel to it, an experiment that didn't go well...at all. 4/10<BR>13- Cruz: This a good song. It's well sung and doesn't sound as any previous track. 8/10<BR>14- Soar: This starts like Pink's \\"missundaztood\\". Not much more than positive lyrics. 7/10<BR>15- Dame lo que te doy / Get mine get yours: The song you get depends on where you live. I got the Spanish song, where she sings to a guy telling him she wants his body, not his heart. 9/10<BR>16- Dirrty (featuring Redman): \\"Wanna get...roudy\\"...we all know this one. It's a hip-hop cut with a Britney-like video, 9/10<BR>17- Stripped pt.2 : She claims, she ain't a diva or a virgin. Not much more to say about this.<BR>18- The voice within : Beautiful song. Produced by Glen Ballard. Christina shows such a vocal ability. It's a ballad about believing in yourself when you can't rely on anybody else. 10/10<BR>19- I'm ok: This is Christina's song about the things she had to go through as a child when her parents fought. Quite touching.8.5/10<BR>20- Keep on singing my song: Mid-tempo positive track. Gets a bit long. I like the bit where she lets out a twenty-second-long \\"Sooonnnngg!\\". 9/10<br />On the whole, this is a great album. Pretty different and much more mature than her previous releases. Christina's a gifted singer, and she shows she can sing almost anything!. Give this a try, you won't regret it!.
B00004XMTH|5.0|This production of cats, although chopped, dubbed and edited, is still wonderful. I say that you should just look past the imperfections and focus on the main thing: entertainment. Veerle Casteleyn, with those big, innocent eyes of hers and angelic voice, makes for the sweetest, most touching Jemima. Jacob Brent as Mistofelees is wonderful, but fans often overlook two other talents: Fergus Logan and Karl Morgan, with their incredible acrobatics, make for astounding performances of Tumblebrutus and Pouncival. Aeva May, with her sense of drama, is quite a memorable Demeter, especially when you see her and Munkustrap nuzzling after the fight with Macavity. Jo Bingham is sooooo cute as Etcetera! Her perky personality and antics really catches your attention. Elaine Paige as Grizabella, excellent!!! Her portrayal of this ravaged old cat leaves not a single dry eye in the house. After the second half of the Jellicle Ball, when she is all alone, Grizabella does a solo dance(probably trying to get the attention of the other cats), but she gives up in the middle, knowing its hopeless. She looks so sad and so lonely standing there all alone at the end of her dance, knowing that they'll never accept her. A truely heartbreaking portrayal, although I do wish her voice was at full power, especially during Memory. A wonderful performance!
0345413377|5.0|This epic trilogy is closer in tone to Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_than the _Harry Potter_ books, but religion and philosophy take center stage. It's still a battle of Good versus Evil, where Pullman updates Milton and Blake by questioning a LOT of assumptions.  In this last volume, the epic battle of Paradise Lost is restaged, angels clash, and not just our own world is at stake.<br />Written as a fantasy-adventure featuring 2 pre-teens, Lyra and Will, this third volume, with a background including an alternate Oxford (UK) (where everyone has a animal-daemon who stays close at hand), intrigue in our own Oxford and the travel between the two, a dangerous Mediterranean world where soul-sucking wraiths only kill adults, introduces no less than underworld of the dead.  Wicked angels proclaiming themselves as moral remind us of many of our own flawed leaders.<br />The last volume of a trilogy has to tie up all the disparate plot points, and Pullman needs a huge loom to do so!  Still more characters and places are introduced, battles rage, and all of this leads up to a heartrending finish.  Many reviewers raged about the finale, the grief they felt, or the frustration in why this came to pass.  But the answer is simple: this is, despite the incredibly rich writing and highly literate and encoded themes, still a YA title, and with this much erotic charge, that's the way YA books have to end.  If he'd ended it on a complete up note with fireworks, tea kettles, and steam engines pulling coaches through tunnels, forever and evermore, then it's not YA.  And I felt the heartpangs of the ending for days after reading this, too...<br />Pullman clearly detests the evil done in the name of religion, which is why the Good and Evil discussion gets intricate. He is not necessarily anti-Catholic or anti-Christian but anti-authoritarian. Anyone who has studied European history will recognize the characterization of a corrupt and overly powerful Church (denomination never specified inthis book, btw). Lyra and Will are bringing The Enlightenment to several worlds who are as politically forward as pre-Reformation Europe, and must defeat powerful forces who have no interest in power-sharing.  In her role as both a knowledge bringer and one willing to sacrifice all for others, Lyra takes on several mythic roles.  She is tempted as Eve, she brings knowledge like the serpent (don't forget that the serpent was revered by other religions, just look at the caduceus; see, one religion's goodness is another's evil, just as in this book!), and she gave up all like Jesus Christ.  Several reviewers complained these books condemn Christianity without any mention of Christ.  Hello?  Don't you think that was Pullman's point, that organized religion rarely stays on track with its original beauty, falling victim to doctrine, power, and control?  <br />With the Catholic Church scandal revealing painful new developments every day, Pullman's work becomes even more timely. Are institutions created to teach morality capable of staying moral? Can moral authorities resist authoritarianism? Which is more important, the integrity of the institution or protecting our most vulnerable citizens? All these issues come to fore in _His Dark Materials_.<br />The books work both as a springboard to All The Big Questions and as an allegory for growing up and finding one's own way.<BR>Literate, informed, evocative, and conceptually brilliant, this supposed Young Adult release will captivate adults as well.
B00000GUZP|5.0|KooKoo was Debbie Harry's first album from 1981, between Autoamerican and The Hunter from Blondie. This is not exactly Blondie's style; it has more of a funk feel. Nevertheless, it's still great. The album takes on a punk, rock, and dance style.  Highlight tracks are Backfired, Military Rap, The Jam Was Moving, and Jump Jump. There's nothing I have heard that sounds quite like it. If you are a fan of Blondie, and like their lead singer, you owe it to yourself to listen to this great album!

0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is a classic cult science fiction film based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by the late Philip K. Dick.  The Blade Runners were formed due to an Off-World mutiny by human like robots called replicants.  Blade Runners functioned to annihilate the replicants, a process called retirement.  The story revolves around the ex-Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is forced to rejoin and help retire four replicants.  However, these replicants are of a new model called Nexus 6, which are far superior to the previous models.  The Nexus 6 have a safety mechanism that automatically retires the replicant after four years.  As a result, they have returned in order to prevent their retirement.  Blade Runner provides a superior cinematic opportunity for suspense and reflection over existentialism, which is delivered with both brute force and gentle touch.

Sorry if I have spoiled anything, but the books ARE called Dragonlance so........<br />In summation: The books are good for all ages (parents, my brother started reading them when he was 8), the authors juggle ensemble better than a Guy Ricthie film and there are talking dragons.

0060523794|4.0|I got what I was looking for in this book - Mr. Gerstner's personal view on the challenges he met at IBM and what he did to protect its new life from what he called IBM's Bolsheviks.  He is very forward about the fact this is from his view point.  He even wondered up front if anyone would want to read about his day at the office!  In particular, the section on culture should be required reading in any graduate level class.  His practical and experienced view supports what the theorists have been telling us for some time - culture is the driving force to the organization.  As a book, it's a short read since a significant portion of it are the appendixes.  While his prose comes across as personable, his own description of himself does make him come across as someone who may have been a very cool cookie having to take the hard stand.  What's most interesting is the history he reveals of a company which became arrogant and distant from its customers -  that \\"history\\" is  being played out right now by Microsoft.  When you read about how IBM managed its pricing with its contribution to poor sales prior to Gerstner's arrival, you can't help but wonder if Bill Gates is paying attention since he's doing close to the same thing with his new licensing policies.  Yes, we repeat history if it's not studied, and for a direct, to the point account of near death experience IBM had, this is a good read.  I gave it one star less than five because towards the end (the last 40 pages or so) it began to get a bit repetitive with themes he already had in the earlier part.

B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' voice, like her eyes, has a whistful beauty and engaging depth. Several songs on this release, such as the much-played and well-known &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, are real gems. But I think they are more than just accidental successes by a mediocre writer. The other tracks here are not as complex or engaging, but have similar emotion and soul. I look forward to Norah's many releases to come and, meanwhile, enjoy this one as a record of her first outing.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Wow! i really dont know what to say. i havent been a long fan of rammstein but when i first heard Ich Will then Sonne i just had to go and buy this album. Mutter has some amazing tracks my favourite being: Sonne , Zwitter , Mein Herz Brennt , Feuer Frei and Adios. I couldnt say there is a worst track on the album because they are all amazing. Most of all the other reviews have a title translation so i wont bother. This album isnt just for goths the tracks differ from time to time so ne1 can listen to it. This is a must buy for any Metal fan!!!!<br />Buy It!!!!!!!
B000002UAF|5.0|I've been filling holes in my music collection, including buying a Beatles release every few months. Each has been full of great reminders, and some even taught me things I didn't know - about the Beatles, about music, or about life.<br />This release isn't really about learning anything, but that makes it imminently enjoyable. To modern ears, it doesn't feel like it's pushing any boundaries, but that keeps it from challenging any sensibilities. Instead, all the songs are complete and strong and enjoyable. Bravo!
0553801481|4.0|I loved Hobb's Assassin series and persevered through the Liveship Traders series and was most relieved to be back with Fitz and the fool in this series. Although the story intially started with all the substance of the 2nd Liveship Trader book (I wasn't very nonplussed by that book - even if Hobb's won back my favour with the 3rd Liveship Trader book!), it picked up very quickly with the appearance of the Fool - now Lord Golden - and Fitz's return to Buckkeep. I found new respect for Hobb's at the end there - she had me absolutely balling my eyes without with her turn of phrase (I shall not mention anymore than that!)<BR>But where this takes off, is the next book - already released in Australia... All I can tell you is if you haven't read the Liveship Traders - you HAVE TO, because the sequel to this contains a jaw-dropping chapter which rocks the entire foundation of the series (for me anyway) and if you haven't read the Liveship Traders, it will mean nothing. So, persevere folks because by golly, its worth it for the ending to this book and the developments in the next book!
B000068OCS|2.0|Someone thinks I may have mistaken IMAX 15/70 for standard 4X3??   <br />No way!  My apartment neighbor here in town is an IMAX projectionist. Koyaanisqatsi has never been released in IMAX 15/70, nor has it ever been screened in *any* form at our three IMAX theaters, so I don't understand how I could possibly have confused the two. I grew up on 4X3 films, and was about 8 years old when the first widescreen films started making the rounds. By now, I believe I've viewed every widescreen process there is, including 3-projector Cinemiracle (which was only ever used for one film: \\"Windjammer\\"). As a person who has spend almost 4 decades of his life involved in virtually every form of legitimate theater from fringe to grand opera, I'm also pretty familiar with such topics as matting, masking and cropping.<br />I'm glad that the writer from Poulsbo, the projectionist, was able to say with certainty that he ran a 16X9 (1.85:1) Koyaanisqatsi print. I'd have loved to have been there. But I will reiterate what I said a few months ago: the Koyaanisqatsi print I saw here about 10 years ago was 4X3 (1.33:1), no possible exception. I'd watched it on laserdisc many times and was *very* curious what differences would turn up on a large screen. There were none.  None.  The image appeared exactly the way one would expect a 4X3 image to look when it's thrown up on a contemporary wide screen: an almost-square postage-stamp of a picture smack-dab in the center, reaching all the way from top to bottom, with the side curtains drawn way, way in.<br />The other thing about these home video releases that I've found particularly galling since the audio. As one other writer put it, the current MGM DVD 5.1 mix sounds like expanded 2-channel. I agree, but it wasn't that way in the theater. The surround sound was solid and highly directional, with the synthesizer clearly jangling away at you through the rear speakers. I say again, this MGM DVD could have been SOOOO much better!<br />Now, here's aquestion I don't think anybody has yet asked. Koyaanisqatsi is sometimes done in concert format, with live music by the Philip Glass Ensemble. Has anybody ever attended one of these things? If you have extremely *clear* memories of what you saw and heard, and would like to share, I, for one, would be absolutely delighted to hear from you.    :-)<br />Roy

0671027344|5.0|For all the lost souls with the over active linguistic skills common to most teenagers of our generation Chbosky magages to encapsulate all the fears and wonderings of the mind into one life-altering read. No matter what problems or thoughts create that sense of failiure in your life, he manages to find time to make you \\"feel infinite\\" just for one moment. The empathy felt with the characters is equal to no other novel's protagonists, and the distinct emotional attachment felt removes you violently from the limbo teenagers so often unwittingly place themselves in. If you do nothing else with your life, make sure you read 'The Perks...' as it will most definitely MAKE you look at life with a profound new sense of wisdom and belonging.

0800130952|5.0|Matilda is worth watching, and I think worth owning too.  However, let's get the reservations over before all the good stuff.<br />Miss Trunchbull, played by Pam Ferris, is a sadist.  She is definitely mean.  At two places in the movie she throws a child out a school window (she is really, really mean).  Matilda's parents are self-absorbed and at best ignore Matilda, which occasionally borders on abuse.  The images of Matilda's school can be disturbing, especially the \\"Chokie\\", a small cramped dark closet with spikes in the door.  These images could be disturbing for younger children, particularly those under the age of 7 or 8.  However, you have to judge the ability of your child to understand that these images are not real.  These are the dark parts of the movie.<br />Matilda is clearly a genius, as evidenced by her actions from a very early age.  Matilda overcomes her not very bright parents and learns how to fend for herself in the world.  In fact, after a while she treats her parents as something to be concerned about, because they clearly do not know how to take care of themselves in the world.<br />Matilda is a positive role model throughout the movie.  She learns to read on her own, and finds the value in the library and books.  She learns that there are people who understand her (Miss Jennifer Honey, played by Embeth Davidtz) and love her for who she is.  She also learns that people who seem scary to her (Miss Trunchbull) can be scary to others.  Her desire to protect others and do what is right helps her overcome her fear of Miss Trunchbull and do what is right.<br />Mara Wilson plays Matilda very well.  She has a lot of talent, and makes Matilda come alive.  Danny De Vito plays Matilda's father and Rhea Perlman plays Matilda's mother, and every time I see them I cringe because these two are very unlikable characters, and I like Danny particularly.  Danny also does a very good job narrating this movie, which somewhat ameliorates his turn as a semi-villain.<br />This movie celebrates, as it does in most Roald Dahl books, the triumph of right over wrong, and perhaps good over evil.  The characters verge on being cartoonish, which is fitting for a children's movie.  Having Matilda be telekinetic adds a wonderful element of fantasy with which children will identify.  It is often a childhood fantasy to have powers or abilities to make things right, and Matilda obtains such a power and uses it for good.<br />This movie has a darker side, but the humorous moments and the Matilda's triumph over all the odds against her make this a fun movie.  Worth watching again and again, I think this movie is well targeted to 8 to 12 year olds, but those of us adults that want to still believe that good will always triumph over bad and that good things eventually come to good people will find the message uplifting.

B00005JLRR|2.0|The central theme of this one seemed to be to strive to be a better man. Picard, at one point, relays this moral lesson to his clone who is bent on destroying the Federation to satisfy his own personal demons. Picard's message should have been directed towards the producers, writer, and director to strive to make a better film. Has Star Trek, I wonder, suffered from severe overkill and attrition with TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, comic books, books, conventions, geeks that dress up in Federation regalla, and not to mention 10 films(the first SIX of which are excellent especially TREK IV-Voyage Home)? The trend of how the even films are superior was broken with this installment. I will continue, however, to rock on with my personal favorite Voyage Home. I was ten years old in 1979 when Star Trek-TMP premiered, and that one actually aged like wine. I think this one will age like vinegar.BRING ON STAR WARS EPISODE III! By the way, the only reason I did not give this one 1 star was that the effects and sound were redeeming enough not to place it in a category with other 1-star failures like Heaven's Gate!
B00005UKE0|5.0|When the Beatles split up in 1970, no one gave a second thought to what John and Paul would do next.  They'd continue to write their own songs, of course.  People figured Ringo's ability to \\"act naturally\\" would land the drummer several film roles.  George was the one people worried about.  How could \\"The Quiet Beatle\\" make it on his own?<br />Harrison answered everyone by kicking the doors down with `All Things Must Pass' in 1970.  People were stunned.  No one had any idea how good he really was.  After one listen, the world knew.  For the first time in his musical career, Harrison was able to call the shots.  He not only picked a top-notch group of musicians, he also wrote two complete discs worth of songs full of tenderness, playfulness, energy, power, and substance.  \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" \\"Isn't It a Pity,\\" and \\"What Is Life\\" are the tunes we remember most, but there's so much more:  You can almost see George winking at us during \\"I Dig Love.\\"  \\"Let It Down\\" and \\"Wah Wah\\" both build huge towers of sound you can get lost in.  The intensity of George's beliefs is evident on \\"Hear Me Lord.\\"  So is his inner peace in the title track.  And how can anyone listen to \\"Apple Scruffs\\" and have a bad time?  <br />With George's final album currently available, this is a great time to revisit his debut masterpiece.  Harrison's explosion of amazing talent was best captured here.  It continues to live on.  Buy it.  Treasure it.
0790729342|5.0|Everything fell into place when they made this one. The level of intensity was turned up a notch for this superior sequel. They obviously cashed in on the success of MAX and spent more $$ on effects, costumes, vehicles, etc. Truck chase at the end is actually superior to truck chase in RAIDERS.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I have always loved this album.  It is, without a doubt, the greatest album by a solo Beatle and one of the greatest albums of all time.  This reissue has both positive and negative points.  One should buy it only for Disc 1 which has the bonus material.  Disc 2 is completely unnecessary if you already have those songs on CD.  All of the bonus songs on Disc 1 are excellent and give a new perspective on the original songs.  They are a definite plus and the only reason to buy this re-issue.  Disc 2 is a throw away for two reasons.  The song \\"I Dig Love\\" has an annoying sound in the background where it was totally quiet on the original CD.  The other reason to throw it away is, of course, the jam sessions.  This 2-CD set is expensive but still worth it for the new material on Disc 1.
0790729628|4.0|I have one word:PUT THE GD FORD NARRATION BACK IN!!! I did not mind the new scenes, but I'm sorry Blade loses a star due to lost narration!Bring it back for Christ sakes!!Early sci fi fare of the 80s coming off the heels of SW and EMPIRE holds up well even for that time. Interesting to go back and view BLADE in this day and age. Matte painting and rotoscoping techniques still look impressive in the age of CG generated Yodas and Coruscant city-scapes. Joanna Cassidy sure looks hot. I wonder what she is doing now?
B000003TA4|5.0|It's been 11 years since this album was released. And Kurt Cobain's sly wordplay and evocative screams still bring the fury and rage of dissatisfied youth into our living rooms. 10 million living rooms, I might add. For that's how many albums this album has sold, and that one little statistic should erase all the criticisms of this album's naysayers. Nevermind is an accepted classic, regularly topping official and unofficial charts. (I know that they sold out ages ago, but for what it matters, Rolling Stone magazine placed this album 2nd right before the Beatles \\"Revolver\\" , in their 100 Best Albums' List). In the 11 years that has passed, we've seen millions of bands come and go trying to rip off Nirvana, and this album. But, I think it can be safely said that none have come close to perfecting the elusive formula of hurt, poetic words , a thunderous rhythm section, and the remarkably melodic guitar chords. They may have made another amazing album (In Utero), turned in a stellar performance with acoustic guitars (MTV Unplugged) , but Nirvana are defined by, and shall continue to be, defined by this album.<BR>                    And not without reason. This was exactly what Nirvana were about. Mixing their raw, punky power-chords, with pop sensibilities. And who's to argue it was the latter quality that made them famous, and introduced alternative rock to Madonna and Michael Jackson listening kids, replacing their spandex clothes with spendthrift flannel? The album defined the whole 90's alternative scene, and it's influence remains with us today. (The Vines, anyone?)<BR>                    The record starts with the most famous Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit. In retrospect, it's easy to see why this song became the grunge anthem of the early 90's. A simple clean guitar figure, then Dave Grohl sends the song into overdrive with perhaps one of the most famous tom-tom rolls in history. The song contains brilliant use of the stop-start dynamics that Nirvana made their own, and Kurt Cobain's ironically witty lyrics (\\"Load up on guns/Bring your Friends/It's fun to lose/To pretend\\"). The song ends with Cobain screaming 'A denial' repeatedly, and distortion dying out in the background, thus bringing an end to one of the most celebrated songs of the decade. We aren't given a respite, however. The melodic chords of \\"In Bloom\\" start up soon after. With it's sing-a-long chorus (a stroke of genius if you know what the song is about), and the noisy (yet effective guitar solo), the song is a standout in an album of standouts. The murky bass lines of 'Come As You Are' start up soon after, as Cobain sings a story of alienation. Curious guitar effects decorate the chorus, and in a frustratingly confusing moment, the band steps a notch for the bridge, while Cobain sings \\"And I swear that I dont have a gun.  It is a positively trandescent moment. The tempo ups slightly with the surging Breed. The song contains an inventive guitar figure, which remains in circulation for the entire song. Dave Grohl, who must surely win any contest for the most powerful drummer of the 90s, again proves why he is such an integral part of the band. Listening to it, you might think its a throwaway song, something of a tribute to the punk rock heroes that influenced the band. Looking up the lyrics, you find you were mistaken. They are clever, concise, and even funny. But thats Nirvana for you.  Lithium is next, and it stands as one of the finest songs the group ever cut.  A song about organized religion, youd never have found out by listening to it. With a delightfully ridiculous chorus of Yeaaahhhhhhh/Yeaaahhhh, yeaahhhh, yeah yeahh!, the song is another obvious standout. (Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, and Lithium. Some of the finest rock songs of the decade. All on one side of a CD. Sound like a masterpiece to you?). The tempo then takes a very sudden, and chilling dip, with the eerie Polly.  Its a nice hum-along song, but a very disconcerting feeling cant help but being noticed, and youll understand why when you read the lyrics. (The song is about the rape of a 14-year old girl).  You arent left to mull over what youve just listened to however, as the zany intro to the punk rock throwaway \\"Territorial Pissings\\" starts up.  As the record draws to its end, you can see truly inspired songwriting in the final 20 minutes or so, with the extremely hummable On A Plain, and Kurt Cobains personal favorite, Drain You being the main highlights. The spurt of enthusiasm stops suddenly with the final track, Something in The Way. Consisting of 2 lone chords, and Cobains chilling vocals reciting a story of living under a bridge, the song brings an end to one of the most important albums of the decade. (Unless you have a version of the album that includes Endless, Nameless a hidden track consisting of a botched cut of Lithium)<BR>                                            Theres a reason why this album has been called a masterpiece. Its just 60 minutes of pure genius. You cant help but wonder how the alternative scene would be like without this album. Hair metal still going strong? Who knows. There may have been better albums, musically, than this in the grunge era (Alice In Chains Dirt comes to mind) , but no album defined the era, and captured the cultural consciousness of the public like this one.

0345440900|5.0|I found this book very helpful for setting up a pattern/schedule for my baby in the beginning which I have continued to use.  (My daughter is now 7 months old).  I also found Tracy Hogg's chapter on sleep for the baby to be very helpful.  Her advice is not too extreme and makes a lot of a sense.  I highly recomend this book in combination with Dr. Spock's and What to Expect the First Year.
0452282152|5.0|In 17th century Holland, 16-year-old Griet is involuntary sent to work as a maid due to her father's occupational accident that left him blind and unemployed. Strings were pulled and she went to live in the Vermeer residence. Griet's beauty and grace catches the eye of Mr. Vermeer, the famous painter, and she eventually becomes his assistant against the wishes of her mistress. As the narrative unfolds Griet must balance her work obligations to her mistress and her fascination with her master and his craft. She is successful in her deceit until her master asks her to pose for the infamous painting that is displayed on this book's cover. After the painting is finished Griet's secret becomes common knowledge in the household and she will have to pay the consequences.<br />I remained fully enchanted while reading THE GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. It is written in such a fantastic and splendid manner that I felt drawn into the pages. The life of a maid during these times was very interesting. In addition, I was captivated by the procedure for extracting the colors for painting that Griet assisted in. It's amazing how times have changed! I am giving a copy of this book to my mother as a gift as I'm sure she will enjoy it as much as I have.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Once in awhile, a series, movie, or song comes along and when you witness it, you are happy that you did.  BAND OF BROTHERS is one of those series.  It's the production of HBO, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (executive producers) and it tells the story of Easy Company of the 101st airborne during World War II.  Every single thing you see is based on facts and I think that is what makes the story so compelling.  The series is composed of 10 episodes, each and hour long and like I said it charts the progress of Easy Company as told by the men who served with the company.  The acting in this series is not only first class, but world class as well.  None of the actors are well known at all (except David Schwimmer) and I think by using unknowns you don't have a lot of over acting.  I hope that the actors that portrayed the real life characters get picked up for other things.  Anyway, the DVD comes in a 6 disc set with 2 shows on each disc and the 6th disc full of bonus features.
B00005JLWL|5.0|I knew nothing about this film.  I went based on ratings I saw online, since I trust regular smoe's I went.  Me, along with my 2 friends were blown away.  I saw it yesterday and I am still shaking me head in amazement.  At first I thought it was going to be another 1984, thought provoking, weird film, then the film went from 1st to 5th gear, skipping the others inbetween.  Camera angles and uses were extremely well done and I suggest you RUN don't walk, but RUN to go see this movie.  Pass the world around, it did not get much adverstisement.  This is the film that hollywood should make.  It takes the Matrix type ideas and gives it an andrelanine shot.   BRAVO!!!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This movie probably rates as one of my favorites of all time - a classic ugly duckling story, pulsating music and dancing, and some of the most hilarious, over-the-top characters over.  Add to that great Australian accents and a true hunk in Paul Mercurio (just wait till you see him dripping sweat during an improvised dance session alone in the studio!), and you have a great movie that can lift any mood.
B00006879E|5.0|Hey all... this album is incredible.  You will not find a better buy and an up-and-coming band.  They are the next generation of music.  Combining funk with pop-rock, they re-define your music experience.  They are awesome!
B000002KCV|5.0|Unlike other albums in the Young cannon, such as 'Hawks &amp; Doves' or 'Old Ways', this is perhaps Young's best outing into country-folk-rock stylings. The orchestral arrangments which were perhaps a little too overblown on 'Harvest' are more consistent, and the addition of several accoutic guitar players helps create an extrodinary wall of sound. Stand out material includes the opening 'Goin' Back,' which sets the mood perfectly, and the energetic title track and 'Field Of Opportunity' are boistered by a funky fiddle accompniment. 'Already One' is a beautiful ballad with the harmonies of Nicolette Larson. The two Crazy Horse related tracks are the best songs - 'Look Out For My Love' 7 'Lotta Love' are superb pieces. Although sometimes ignored and overlooked, this album is one of Young's most underrated &amp; perhaps, even one of his greatest.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Everybody was expecting a 10 stars hit from director Christopher Nolan in this film . As result - they was very dessapointed . I watched this film totally blank , without any expectations . As result - I loved it . No flashy scenes , no big chases . Just very solid and deep film . I gave it only 4 stars just because of the power of the director in it . You can feel how much power he has ... but holding back a little . This feeling of danger and exitment at same time . Friends ! He is about to explode ! Next one will be a killer .<BR> I didn't say anything about what this film about just because it is so many very good reviews right behind me . I don't want to repeat them . But I can tell you which moment I loved the most ... the last one :<BR>- Nobody needs to know ?!<BR>-I just need to catch some sleep....

B00005JLRR|4.0|I am a lifelong Star Trek fan and I think that this is the best NextGen movie other than First Contact.The only criticism I have of this movie is that it is way too BIG!  There are enough big events and big moments in this show to make two good movies.  John Logan said in TV Guide that there is 50 minutes of edited footage that was cut from the movie in order to get it under two hours.  I think the lost 50 minutes hurts the movie.  They should have made two movies with this story or left in some footage.  Let's not forget that Attack of the Clones was nearly two and a half hours long.I did like the movie, and I hope they make another.  Logan and Stuart Baird seem to be a good combination, but I would get another editor.  The action scenes were frequent but seemed over nearly before they began.  On the plus side, the humor in the movie was very natural and was in character.I would rate the movie a solid B.  Does not flow as well as First Contact but way better than Insurrection or Generations.
630469797X|5.0|I have seen this movie nearly 25 times, and it has never lost its luster. this films social criticism is probably my favorite aspect of this movie. its great to think about \\"what would i do if everyone i knew and love suddenly was my enemy?\\" and \\"where would i go and what could i do?\\". personally i would curl up in the corner and allow myself to be consumed by my dead grandmother or something. it allows us a look into true human nature and really makes you think...plus the gore is great! did i mention that? no? well its great! i think dawn of the dead has to be my favorite out of the Dead series. oh yeah, buy it. you wont be dissapointed...but i would wait until that 3-disc special edition set comes out if i were you. its one of my favorite movies, but its not worth 100 bones.
0316286443|5.0|It is a great book. Includes photographs of today actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow as James Dean, yes!! James Dean, Julia Roberts as Julie Christie in Dr. Zhivago. And it explains the techniques to achieve those results.

B00005JKQZ|3.0|Beautiful Mind won a swag of Oscars, including best picture, so you'd have to give it the benefit of the doubt. But, an hour in, my patience was sorely tested: a jumbled intro, some sketchy back-story exposition, and the film makes a hard left hand turn and appears to veer into low-rent Bond territory; Ed Harris appearing as a mysterious, over-hammed Chandleresque government dude, shooting up Russian infiltrates, and spouting the most hackneyed dialogue you'll find outside a Bruce Willis disaster flick. As the minutes pass the likelihood of the film pulling itself out of this spectacular swan dive appreciably diminishes, and in fact I had concluded that all hope was lost; this was just a clunker and the Oscar rout a sham, when blow me if it didn't pull out at the very last minute, like some Red Arrow pilot at an air show, with what Leonard Maltin correctly describes as &quot;a doozy&quot; of a plot twist. I won't give it away: just watch.<br />So, having so deftly leapt out of the frying pan, imagine the disappointment when the real film, struggling to get out from the faux over-lay, turns out to be a routine Sunday Sickness matinee, spiced up at the end by a poorly worked in redemption scene. The closing, teary vibe has Ron Howard written all over it - just like Robin Williams can never escape the fact that he was Mork from Ork, Howard will for ever be Richie Cunningham, and this is every inch a film made by a mummy's boy from suburban Milwaukee. Not nearly enough Fonz in it for me.<br />Not exactly assisting matters is Horner's music, which offers the same subtle pleasure and impish inventiveness as his score for Titanic. That's sarcasm, folks.<br />Russell Crowe deserves a mention for portraying a dislikable geek &amp; nutcase so well, never an easy stunt for a Hollywood hunk (Ralph Fiennes made a meal of the same job in Red Dragon), and Jennifer Connelly plays the long suffering spouse nicely. The last film I saw her in was Labyrinth, so she's come on a bit.<br />Ron Howard pulled a few pretty cool tricks, and ultimately this film is pleasant enough to watch. My only observation is that if this was good enough to win best Picture, it must have been a lousy year./>Ron Howard pulled a few pretty cool tricks, and ultimately this film is pleasant enough to watch.

B000002N2Z|5.0|This is my favorite CD and it has been since I got in 95. What makes it so great is it is heavy as heck but it has a groove in every song that you can get into. Chino is probably the best singer out there(Maynard is a close second) he mixes soft-near lullaby singing one second with crazy screaming a second later. The music goes right along with him, at times quiet and almost pretty to death defying decibels. Every song has a great riff, it might not be Clapton but it is a lot better than most newer bands. Deftones have spawned more clones than probably even Korn. Most everyone on the radio has a little Deftones in them especially older Staind, Limp Bizkit, and Taproot. The best songs on this disk are 1-11. Seriously, when I listen to this Cd there is no skipping tracks because they are all great. The standouts are Bored, Minus Blindfold, Seven Words, One Weak, Lifter, and the #11 the hidden track. So if you want to buy an original CD by a very talented and influential band buy this you won't be disappointed.
B0000028M7|5.0|I love this record! I find myself listening to it over and over. *EVERY* track is good! No filler and no song that is not worth your time. This is the definitive AIC album and once you take a listen to it you will discover why. I dont agree with everybody about them being grunge, personally I believe they were closer akin to metal than any other genre. RIP Layne Stanley! I highly reccomend this album!
B000003TAR|5.0|Although this is a more mature, and follow-up version of the greatest album ever, Nevermind, it still ranks among the best there is. In Utero features a more emotional and louder/harder rock than its predicesor, not to mention more powerful songs like Rape Me, a song unmatched by any. Emotionally, the maturity shows as well with tracks like Heart-Shaped Box, a song about Courtney Love. <br />                                     Track Analysis<BR>1) SERVE THE SERVANTS: 5/5<BR>One of the better songs on the album and another more-mature-than-Nevermind song. With a sense of anger fueled at Kurt's father, he expresses the problems that it caused for him to not have an male figure to model after. Not to mention a great punk riff.<br />2) SCENTLESS APPRENTICE: 4/5<BR>Loud and angry, once again a reflection of Kurt's meaningless youth. Keeps a theme that continues throughout the record, you have to listen to it to feel it.<br />3) HEART-SHAPED BOX: 5/5<BR>The biggest hit off the album and the first single. Countless songs have copied the sound of this one and still none of them are as good.<br />4) RAPE ME: 5/5<BR>My personal favorite song on this one. Nirvana's 3rd most powerful song behind \\"Something in the way\\" and \\"polly\\" (their first anti-rape song), both from Nevermind. A phenomenal power chord riff, great lyrics, everything you could ask for in a song. Flawless.<br />5)Frances Farmer will Have Her Revenge on Seatlle: 5/5<BR>Fluent and angry at the same time, unlike Scentless Apprentice. Very good.<br />6) DUMB: 5/5 <BR>Inspired by the beatles, as everyone can tell when they listen to it. If this was on Nevermind instead of \\"On a Plain\\" (still an incredible song) it would be even BETTER.<br />7) VERY APE: 4.5/5<BR>A bit over done on the riff, but a great, strong powerful song.<br />8) MILK IT: 4.5/5<BR>A bit hard for my taste, but an essential part of this CD. <br />9)PENNYROYAL TEA: 4.5/5<BR>Good for a break from the intensity of songs like the previous one, not a WHOLE lot to it though.<br />10) RADIO FRIENDLY UNIT SHIFTER: 4.5/5<BR>And just when you thought it was getting slower, you are hit by this exlosion of fierce guitars and lyrics. A little too much after a step down like Pennyroyal Tea.<br />11) TOURETTE'S: 5/5<BR>Now this is a violent song that is not only intense and fluent, it is mind-boggling. Definitley worth waiting for.<br />12) ALL APOLOGIES: 5/5 <BR>The Unplugged Version was waaaayyyyy better but nothing could possibly spoil this song except for disco backing. The lyrics are the most thought-provoking they ever released. Amazing song but I advise you to buy the Unplugged album as well for this song if not for all the others.<br />In conclusion, an essential part of any music collection... This is real music with real emotion and lyrics... We could really use Kurt nowadays. R.I.P
B00001OH7Y|4.0|I Think Scary Monstes is among Bowies top albums. the LP is funky, its electronic, the beats and the melodies are beautiful. His lyrics and authentic voice mixed with all kinds of different instruments make this among the best albums of the early 80s. Includes two of his most loved hits Fashion and Ashes To Ashes among others such as Scary Monsters Super Creeps and more make this album my day. I never get tired of it and the reason why it is fresh and after 20 years it doesnt sound a bit dated. I recomend everyone who want to experience Bowie to buy this album Its really really good.
B000066NW0|4.0|My teen and preteen daughters love Avril, and this CD gets lots of play in our house.  I have to admit I'm rather fond of Anything But Ordinary myself.  From what my kids have seen of her so far, Avril makes a better role model than most other teen singers.
B00001OH1S|5.0|I didn't know this version existed. It was in limited release some time after the movie's release. This is a hot movie and the music is even hotter. Just happened to be on eBay and checking for this occasionally. I discovered that there is an expanded edition. It was a limited release but the cd contains music that is over 60 minutes long. I've got the DVD but always love rewinding to my favorite parts just to hear the music.
B000069AUI|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, I felt that it was not as good as &quot;Parachutes&quot;. After the song &quot;Clocks&quot;, the CD fell a little bit to me. But, after listening to it for a few months, I now believe that it's almost as good as their debut. Leadoff single &quot;In My Place&quot; is as good, if not better, than anything they've put out previously and second single &quot;The Scientist&quot; is good, though the video improves the song immensely. My favorite songs, however, are &quot;Politik&quot; and the title track. The former is about the hardest rock track they've written, but reminds me of the Flaming Lips' song &quot;One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21&quot; in the way that in the end, the tone seems to change completely into something more hopeful or desperate. The latter is about the closest Coldplay's ever going to come to a 9/11 tribute...and it works brilliantly (&quot;Someone laughed, some just sit and cry/But you just sit down there and you wonder why&quot;). Overall, Coldplay has once again turned out an amazing body of work.
B00003Q43A|3.0|Devlin & Emmerich have chosen to revive the popcorn movie. Every film they've made is essentially another attempt at capturing an audience's attention and wowing them. ID4 serves that purpose quite well. Essentially a rip off of H. G. Wells War of the Worlds (right down to the \\"virus\\" that destorys the aliens although in this case it's a computer virus), it's not great or even good cinema just plain old fashioned fun.<br />Defying the laws of physics (and good plotting) the aliens have come to turn the Earth into a wasteland. They are essentially like Locusts--they use a planet's resources and move on. It's never pointed out that we  have already done a good job of the same thing. Bull Pullman gives a nicely textured (and believable) performance as the President of the United States. If the world is ever destroyed by aliens, I'd vote for him to save the day. Jeff Goldman turns his usual nervous tics and gestures into another scientist character.<br />Stock characters aside, ID4 works because of the sheer epic scale. It's not a science fiction movie. It uses all the props mind you, but, really, it's a disaster movie. The visuals are pretty good eye candy and the commentary on how they were achieved is also quite good.<br />The extras are little more than fluff pieces that were prepared as part of Fox's advertising campaign. Why the alternate version wasn't put on the main disc as an option is beyond me. Yes, it's unbelievable but it's fun in a B movie sort of way. In fact, that about sums up ID4; it's a fun B movie made on an A budget. Just leave your brain in cruise control. If you try and think too much about this illusion of a film, you'll strain yourself.
B00006JIAF|5.0|once in a while every ten years or so there are a few bands that will be remembered for years to come unlike the hundreds of one hit wonders over this period of time, the strokes are one of those bands that will be remembered and go onto do great things. Well this is how it looks with their album is this it.<br />Out of all the pearl jam wanna be bands out there (creed, nickelback, defualt etc etc) and all the 'THE' bands out there now claming to be the saviours of rock (the white stripes, the vines, the hives etc) the strokes are the bands that will carry on with a huge fan base and be remembered for years to come.<br />Take a listen to is this it and hear the smooth vocals of julian, the simple but very effective light sound of albert and nick on the guitars. Also fab and nickolia on the drums and bass adding to the songs sound and not just trying to show off. Every song on is this it has a signature strokes sound but is each different in its own way. Not to mention they are all fregin catchy specially barely legal and someday.<br />My favourite song on the album being barely legal should be the place to start for a person who has heard the singles (someday, last ngiht, hard to explain) but is scared the rest of the album doesnt mesure up. <br />The real strokes winner though is the song NEW YORK CITY COPS a superb song but was taken off the album and replaced with when it started becuase it was a bit sensitive becuase of 9/11. NYC COPS can still be found ont he european version of is this it or on the hard to explain single. SO i really suggest picking one of those up as well.<br />Now, as i am reviewing the dvd version of is this it the dvd includes the 3 music videos. Last night is played live but not to an audiance, fun video, the guys are looking great and the video just rocks. Hard to explain is a weird video, its my least favourite strokes song and the video is very weird. I guess its hard to explain it (excuse my terrible pun). Someday video si cool, showsthe guys in rehersal and chilling out in a bar. THe live preformances are where this dvd is at though. NYC COPS sounds great live, they are on a sqaure stage lit from the bottom and surrounded by an audiance , nick looks so cool when doing the awsome solos NYC COPS contains. ALthough julians vocals are not quite loud enough at points. The modern age live is a great preformance the band is very tight and once again nick hammers that solos with style.<br />SO all round is this it is the best album since pearl jams yeild, and the dvd is the icing on the cake. GO get it soon!
B00005JKZ3|2.0|After spending most of the budget to get back Jones, Smith (as well as Sonnefeld)and whipping up fun special effects, there wasn't any money left for a good screenplay. A pity as Men In Black offered alot more potential than this anemic by the numbers sequel could deliver. The plot? It doesn't really matter but Lara Flynn Boyle plays an morphing alien that comes to earth looking for a device that will enable her to rule the Universe. Will Smith has to recruit his old partner Tommy Lee Jones to help save the world again because he's the only one who knows where it is and how to get to it.<br />Nobody's going to strain an acting muscle in this type of picture. All the actors live up to our expectations of what we've come to expect from Hollywood drivel. The most amusing (and best) part of the film is the first fifteen or twenty minutes as Smith must get rid of a new partner and break in an old one. The sequence in the post office is the most inspired bit in the whole movie. The rest of the plot is as transparent as a newly cleaned pane of glass.<br />The science fiction elements of this visual comic book are props. This film (like it's parent)has enough holes in the science to drive a truck through. On the other hand, as a comic book it's not bad just uninspired. Sonnefeld's direction has more in common with connect the dots than actual film making. As a popcorn film, Men In Black 2 isn't bad just an underachiever. It's an enjoyable way to spent a mindless afternoon. A pity that Sonnefeld elected to remake the first film vs. trying something new. I doubt that he'll do another sequel with the original cast. They'll be no money left around for the visual effects much less than screenplay. Without the visual effects, Men in Black III might as well be about a bank heist.
B00006V9A0|1.0|For a band that only put out 3 studio albums, the mere thought of a greatest hits compilation seems frivolous.  It is, in Courtney Love's own words, a blatant attempt &quot;to make millions of dollars&quot;.  Keep in mind that this is the same woman who sold the rights to her late husband's own personal journals.  The compilation itself is an unthoughtful and messily-arranged collection that to call Nirvana's best is almost an insult.  Where are such fan favorites as Negative Creep, Drain You, Aneurysm, and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter?<br />Unlike the made-for-MTV punk bands of today, Nirvana didn't wrap filler songs around one or two singles and call it a day--each album is an experience, and deserves to be listened to all the way through.  If you need an introduction to Nirvana, skip this and buy any of their studio albums.  If you have all of their albums, invest in a CD burner, download You Know You're Right off of KaZaa or Morpheus, and make a compilation of your own favorite songs; it's what Kurt would have wanted.
0064407667|5.0|I work in a middle school and wanted to know what the deal was with Lemony Snicket books. The kids were talking about it all the time talking about clues and references and the vocabulary. There is a waiting list for each of the 9 books at my school. I decided to read the first one. It is a twisted adventure that as the author puts it is truely a \\"series of misfortunate events\\". The author writes in a style which draws the reader in by acting as if the books are important documents that the reader has received to keep them safe. His writing also heavily involves literature and historical references which has stimulated my middle school kids to look up Edgar Allen Poe, J.D. Salinger and Richard Gorey. And his use of large words followed up by \\"which means. . .\\" is absolutely great for learning at this age. The first time I heard the kids saying \\"aberrant, which means very very wrong and causing much grief\\" or \\"idiosyncrasies, which means an unique habit\\" I didn't know where they were getting it. Also the writer is a mysterious prop himself. My kids research him on the internet and are constanly trying to find more clues. These books are not just morbid or gothic, they are an interactive experience. If you want a true review of these \\"series of unfortunate events\\" DON'T ask adults, ask the kids. Better yet, go to goggle and type in Lemony Snicket.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Harrison fans have always known what the man was capable of. His first two solo albums delivered.  Subsequent albums, while each having great moments, nevertheless left fans (at least this one) feeling that he could have done better.  \\"Brainwashed\\" represents a return to form.  It's very, very good.  Not a slack moment from start to finish.  (I'm beginning to think it might be his best album.  It is, of course, too early to make such a pronouncement but as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out. Time will tell.)  The songwriting is superb.  (\\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\", in particular, is Beatles quality.)  The slide guitar playing is the best of his career.  (Check out the work in the opener \\"Any Road\\".  And \\"Stuck\\" features the best slide solo he's ever done.)  Does this album REALLY deserve five stars?  Let's put it this way: McCartney's \\"Flaming Pie\\" was nominated for a Grammy for album of the year and Dylan's \\"Time Out of Mind\\" won one.  \\"Brainwashed\\" is better than either of those.

B00005MKA1|5.0|... of listening to this album, I believe I am qualified to say that it is an underrated great classic that will one day be recognised as Marley's finest. Every song on the album is great. My favorites are Is This Love, She's Gone, and Misty Morning, but they are all of outstanding quality. Instrumentally the whole thing is perfect, and the remastering makes it even better. If I had to pare my collection of 250 CDs down to only 5, this one would easily make the cut--it is that good.<br />If, however, you are offended by references to smoking marijuana, then Bob Marley is not for you.
B00005LC1H|4.0|POSITIVES:  These classic episodes are even more spectacular on crystal-clear DVDs, most of the interviews are interesting, and there are a few good special features (for example, the documentary on Torquay and the real-life nasty hotel manager who served as the model for Basil Fawlty).<br />NEGATIVES:  The people who interviewed the cast members, and the people who provided the episode commentaries, seemed to be totally unprepared for their job, and appeared to be making up their questions and comments as they went along.<br />BIGGEST SURPRISE:  Andrew Sachs is a quiet, intelligent, dignified stage actor with a British accent, completely unrecognizable as the the goofy Spanish bellman/waiter he plays in the series!<br />MOST UNPLEASANT SURPRISE:  Andrew Sachs's interviewer never once asked him to do any lines in his goofy &quot;Manuel&quot; voice and character, so how do we know it was really him?  It's kind of like interviewing Mel Blanc and never asking him to do Bugs Bunny.
B000002H2H|5.0|I would write a long review, but one word can some up this cd.  Masterpeice.  This is one of the best cds i own, there is no better metal band, I very highly recommend this album, along with any of their many others.  All and all the 50 minutes of this cd, are simply mind blowing.
0553577123|5.0|I recently read The Diary of Anne Frank: The Definitive Edition by Anne Frank. I told my parents that I was reading it and they told me it was a good book, but I never thought I would like it as much as I did. I liked this book so much because you got to know Anne, her family and the guests that were staying with them in the place they called the Secret Annex. Anne let you know exactly what was happening which made me feel like I had actually been there right by her side. What also made the writing of the book excellent in my opinion was that Anne was a very outgoing girl. She made the passages in her diary sound more exciting to make the reader want to read more. You also got to know Anne more mentally than any other person in the book. She shares her inner most thoughts and feelings with her diary, Kitty. I also thought it was very interesting to find out that all the members in the annex hid from the Nazis for a little over 2 months. This book has definitely changed my outlook on the Holocaust and life. I recommend it to anyone!
B00006RINF|5.0|I can't believe I'm not tired of this &quot;dark wave&quot; style of music yet because it all sounds so much alike. Turn on any track of &quot;Comalies&quot; and you'll probably like it. In fact, if you like the first track, than you'll like the second, and the third, and the fourth, ... they all have the same structure, same super catchy refrains, same great guitars and rhythms, same synthesized atmospheric effects, etc. But that's the ONLY bad thing about this album, and one might argue that's not bad anyway. Buy this and impress people with it 'cause it's a stunner.
0060523794|1.0|During the 1990's every computer company did well.  I believe that Gerstner did a good thing when he expanded into the Global Services Unit. But I would not go as far as saying that he &quot;saved&quot; IBM corp from going bankrupt! He failed to mention how selfish and cruel he is in his book.  He forgot to talk about the jet that he took as a going away gift from IBM corp upon retirement...In addition, he took an apartment in Manhatten, a large bonus, stock options just to mention a few.  While he took from the corporation others had major salary cuts and layoffs.  People have committed suicide because they lost their jobs.  I didn't see any of that in his book about saving a company...at what cost!!  He is the most hated and most selfish CEO.  IBM employees all over the world cringe at his &quot;good business&quot; practices.  I would recommend that you read this book at the bookstore.  Don't buy it.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Well.... Data is starting to show his age, even though he's an unaging android. His skin has wrinkles, ...<br /><br />As for the movie.. well it's got substance. Some of the acting seems forced, especially the Romulans. Picard's nemesis 'Shizone' (sp?) is a good actor, thankfully. His alien friends though seem typical of Trekkie aliens; cannon fodder! Reiker's acting is subpar. But that's okay because the only actors that get any significant amount of screen time are Data, Picard, and Shizone. Everyone else only show up for a few minutes here and there. Picard's acting is spot on. Data is great as well.<BR><br /><br />For the first twenty minutes the movie seems rushed to setup the stage. Even Captain Janeway appears and suddenly Picard meets his old friend from Voyager (the acting here seems forced), ... The whole stage setup is very forced, but the acting saves it all. Some of the battles with the Romulan vessels and the Scimitar seem forced but do provide some needed action entertainment. It seems that ever since the Enterprise E entered the fleet it's been demolished, smashed up, taken apart. It never seems to be the formidable war machine that is was made to be. The Romulans new ships are bigger than it. Same with Scimitar!<BR><br /><br />Oh well... The good points of the movie are Picard and Data's acting, as well as Shizone's. Their is excitment that channels the film to it's end. So it is a pretty good film. It's just that a lot of it seems forced. Hopefully we can expect a good Deep Space Nine movie, next time.<BR><br />
B00005JKNF|1.0|My gripes with this touted film:<br />1) One of Altman's most pointless, inaccessible films.<BR>If the sheer pointlessness of the proceedings hasn't occurred to you before you reach the closing credits, then we have lived on different planets all our lives. The story is nothing so much as a mass of trivial detail. If the characters had cores, if they did something major that pushed the story one direction or another, everything in Gosford Park would be welcomed as rounding or coloring character. It would be masterful. But as coloring or flavoring is all that happens in a film about basically anonymous, unappealing characters, it adds up to pure piffle. <BR> <BR>2) Dislikable characters, some intensely so. <BR>Perhaps the fact that they are all creeps ameliorates the fact we never get to know them. But I am not sure this narrative fault is so easily converted to a virtue. Hitchcock said a dislikable lead was the kiss of death to any film. (Same as a weak villain.) He was at pains throughout his long career to find leading actors with whom the audience could identify. Then, if the scenario should fail in spots, the \\"known quantity\\" of a Cary Grant or James Stewart would insure continued audience involvement in the meantime. I am certain Altman's adherants consider him Hitchcock's better; but truly, Altman could have learned a make or break lesson from Hitchcock here, i. e. You have to WORK to make the audience CARE. Even great artists do. Honest.<br />This is apparently the Emperor's New Movie for the new Millenium, an atrocity no one who is at all image-conscious will renounce publicly. I guess artists reach a point of respectability where no one will say \\"This stinks.\\" Critics, remembering his career triumphs such as Vertigo, Rear Window, Strangers On A Train and Psycho, would not say Frenzy was less than top drawer Hitchcock. --Not the auteur critics, not the quick turn around tabloid critics. There was too much warm feeling for the director's past. I see this as being what \\"saved\\" this film from being savaged and tossed on Altman's disaster heap, alongside Cookie's Fortune. It is competently made, no question. I just wish something had happened in the film.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is one of those rarely-made movies that have created a paradigm shift in my day-to-day operations.<br />Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky draws on the writings of Hubert Selby, Jr. to create a lasting image of the destructive effects addiction has on the human body and spirit, one that gest underneath the skin and stays with you.<br />The movie chronicles the lives of four connected characters:  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  Each of these people have their own visions of happiness that begins innocently enough in their minds the way hopes, wishes, and dreams do in all of us--little \\"what if\\"s and \\"It'd sure be nice to\\"s that usually die on the back burner where they were born.<br />But in this movie, other factors come in that cruelly give this quartet the opportunity (some would say excuse) to pursue these dreams to the point where they become an unhealthy obsession from which there is no escape, only a temporary release from the pain by plunging further into their dreams, which by the film's ending, have mothered their own personal nightmares.<br />Many people who reviewed this movie have made the error of stating that this is an anti-drug movie.  While the connection is more than apparent in the film (all four characters are putting some kind of drug into their bodies) the real core message and point of the film is how addiction in general, to anything, had the ability and strength to overwhelm and subvert the human spirit.  Take for example, movies.  <br />Going to the movies (or watching one at home) is a great way to \\"get away\\" from life for a while and momentarily forget about the things that make up the darker threads of the human tapestry.  The problem arises, when one enjoys the escapist quotient of movies to the point where all other activites that make up real life are eschewed in favor of this quick fix.  The same statement can bemade about drugs, alcohol, video games, etc.<br />The real tragedy in the movie is that all four characters flat-out admit that their willpower and perserverance have succumbed to their addictions.  The most memorable is the pivotal scene at the end of the first act, when Sara, who has been told that she will appear on television, talks to Harry about the diet pills she's been taking so she can fit back into the red dress she had worn at Harry's graduation.  Sara is no road scholar, so she is unaware what the diet pills could do to her if she ever overdoses, but she loves the feeling that she gets when she takes them.  She never overtly admits that her taking the pills makes her happy, but that is the real truth she hides from herself.  She doesn't want to stop taking them because the feeling she gets from them is better than life the way it was before she was perscribed them:  boring, widowed, lonely Sara, sitting in front of the TV and nursing her box of chocolates.<br />The movie is not about drugs.  It is about addiction, and it shows us what addiction does to people with the stark honesty and brutality that no high school class or parental seminar or psychology professor could ever have hoped to achieve.

B00003CXAY|5.0|too many people seem caught up in the imagery and soundtrack to this film. both are first rate. that isn't what the film is really about. i read one review here where the person didn't like the message! that really unnerved me a great deal. this movie is important precisely because of it's message. you don't like the message? too bad. don't go whining when you have no air to breathe, water costs $5 a gallon because all the chemicals we pump into the earth make fresh water a valuable commodity, don't go whining about how your children are born with birth defects because the govenrment is open to bribes from polluters. don't complain that you can't get a decent job because you have to compete with other humans who breed like rats and like you, prefer to bury their heads in the sand and chant the \\"lalala this isn't happening\\" mantra.<br />koyaanisqatsi should be required viewing in every school. it isn't mere preaching, it FACTUALLY shows you what we're doing to the planet that wants to give us life. we humans aren't nearly as smart as we give ourselves credit for. the fact is we are more ruled by our selfishness and shortsightedness.<br />things haven't gotten any better since it was made. they have gotten significantly worse. i can remember when winter was really winter. last year, it hit 80 degrees in february! that isn't right. with higher temperatures caused by MORONS IN SUVs who see nothing wrong with breeding 5-10 more morons to continue their \\"traditions\\", the earth will retaliate with increases in bacterial infections as has already been ducumented and killer bee swarms (that shouldn't even be here to begin with) will move further north.<br />the signs are here... we're just too ignorant to stop what we're doing. some people's answer... ignore the problem and kill the messenger. entire areas of coral reef that have lived for millions of years have died almost overnight because we have raised the temperature only 2 degrees in less than 100 years. things will get worse before they get better. destroy enough links in the chain of life... and there will be huge consequences down the road.<br />koyaanisqatsi is a film WAY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME. there was really no talk of global warming back then, and there really still isn't even now. i agree with my DVD's caption: \\"until now, you've never really seen the world you live in\\" the problem is, flawed human nature prevents anyone from seeing anything that they don't want to see, especially if it makes a person question themselves. humans are very resistant to introspection, and are always looking for someone else to blame. everybody wants to pretend they're perfect, but none of us are. regardless... we really do need to start doing things differently and stop hiding from the truth because it's unpleasant. the truth really can hurt you, especially when you refuse to confront it.<br />that is what koyaanisqatsi does and why it's so important, not the terrific soundtrack... and not the sensory overloading visuals... it's the message \\"this is what YOU are doing to the world you live in\\" this film has inspired me to give up on automobile ownership for good. i now commute by bicycle or mass transit. i'm actually surprised that i get resistance from cashiers for wanting to re-use old shopping bags. i get annoyed by whiners who complain that tree huggers are robbing them of their cushy jobs destroying the planet.... to bad! get another job... preferebly in recycling or farming.<br />koyaanisqatsi is a film about the unstoppable momentum of human apathy and devotion to ignorance. it's the only series that i know of that's brave enough to slap people in the face with their own shortsightedness with something even more powereful than words that can be debated by reactionary circular logic. it confronts us with images that can't be explained away by anyone claiming to be a rational person. the ONLY things wrong on this planet, are the direct result of humans. it's too bad that as a person... this fact might hurt your feelings.<br />animals are actually much smarter than us... because they know enough to play by \\"god's\\" rules. we humans are so full of ourselves that we think we have a better way... we don't. ironically enough... the simple life really is better. faster living creates new sources of stress. fact: on average... hunter gatherer societies need only work 3-4 hours a day... think about that when you're stressed out at your second job so that you can pay for the SUV that you can't really use to run over those little japanese cars that dare to get in your way making you road rage.<br />you can take the man out of the cave... but you can't take the cave out of the man.
B00003CXS4|5.0|\\"Snatch\\" is an incredibly well crafted film, one of those rare watch-over-again and again experiences.  A truly must-see for anyone who enjoys film-making at its best.  And great fun for anyone who enjoys the surprise of plot, and the challenge of thinking.  The cast is superb, and I can see why so many actors in the last 3 years have said they'd work for Guy Ritchie for scale pay.  The man is fresh and resourceful, hilarious, and an impossible story-teller.  You cannot help but get involved. I own 2 copies, because one may wear out.

B00006F7S4|2.0|Beck has been known for his dramatic changes between albums. You never really know what to expect on the new beck album. That was the case this time around. When Beck released &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; i loved his angry/quirky acoustic rock. The On his next major label release &quot;Odelay&quot; i loved his pop/bop style and the drum and guitar loops instead of the full band sound. then on &quot;Midnight Vultures&quot; i liked his party have fun approach. But when you go from making angry, goofy, part rock to making a prcticaly acoustic album practicly mumbling your words in the microphone because you are pretending to be sad and then not even having one song with a proper rythem section. There's been to much change. Sure beck is now a veteran of the music buisness, and he probably knew that this album wasn't gonna fly with alot of his fans. But he did it anyway beacause it's about the music and not what people think. But it still is a bad album but i have to give Beck credit for going out on a limb and doing something he wanted to do.

This glaring ommission is no doubt intentional, and those responsible should find other employment where cheating people isn't frowned upon.

B00006RU5B|5.0|You have to wonder about Amazon's \\"Spotlight Reviews\\".  Sometimes it seems like they just want something to fail. What's the average review here?  4.5?  You wouldn't know it from the \\"Spotlights\\".  Amazon is trying to sell these CD's, right?<br />Anyway, you probably won't see that part of the review, thanks to \\"policy\\".  \\"...\\" here I come.<br />Anyway, I wasn't expecting this CD to be that good, but it certainly is.  I was hesitant because I never thought mixing Rage's music with Cornell's vocals was a good idea.  But it works fantastically.<br />It might as well have been a duet between Cornell and Morello.  You can tell when each was in control.  But like other Rage CD's, the antagonism between musicians just goes together to create something better than mere cooperation.<br />I never listened to Cornell's solo, but it's good to see him back in form.  Audioslave is rocking.  I know I've had \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" playing in the back of my head for the past several weeks.  It's like Soundgarden, but with Morello's unconventional guitar work showing itself in every track.<br />Really, if a Soundgarden/Rage Against the Machine mix sounds even remotely good to you, you need to pick this CD up.

B00005JK8K|1.0|You're in your trench and you see the enemy coming -what do you do?  In this movie, you always stand up so the enemy has a better shot.  Because of this, the battle scenes look like Napoleonic battles with the solidiers in WWII garb. The movie shows both sides to be equally stupid - immediately giving up any cover when the enemy is spotted.  The inane battle scenes, plastic emotions of the actors, and the portrayal of the solidiers of both sides as dumb grunts makes it easily 1-star.
B000000ITM|5.0|Few albums have had greater impact than the landmark John Mayall With Eric Clapton &#34;Blues Breakers.&#34; Released by the Decca label in Britain on 22 July 1966, literally days after Clapton quit the Bluesbreakers and just a week before Cream's debut, it went all the way to #6: no mean feat since Mayall's band had never had a hit single. This may have been a first in Britain.  Of course, this is the album that set the blues and guitar worlds aflame and established Eric Clapton's name worldwide as the most passionate of musical interpreters. If you haven't yet heard &#34;Beano&#34; (as the album is affectionately known, because Clapton is pictured reading &#34;The Beano&#34; comic book on its cover), then you ain't heard nuthin' yet!  From the album's first notes, you realize that you're in guitar heaven, as &#34;Slowhand&#34; shows us the way electric guitar can and should be played. Clapton's virtuoso playing is white-hot throughout. Playing with maturity beyond his then-21 years, the young guitarist was so influential that Gibson eventually reissued the (out-of-production-since-1960) Les Paul model guitar, which Clapton then played.  John Mayall's Bluesbreakers served--and his current band still serves today--as a finishing school for great musicians and sidemen (Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, John McVie, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Mick Fleetwood, Walter Trout, Coco Montoya and others). Mayall's proselytizing the blues (he's 82 years old!), his songwriting skills and his other musical talents should not be ignored nor taken lightly.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I sincerely doubt that I could say anything about &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; that hasn't been said already, and said more eloquently.  What made this series special is the fact that stories are based on actual events that took place. I especially enjoyed the &quot;unknown&quot; cast which added to the idea of the &quot;greatest generation&quot; being made up of everyday people.  At first I was a bit put-off by David Schwimmer in his role.  I thought that I would see &quot;Ross&quot; from &quot;Friends&quot; but after the first moment he became his character and I never thought of him as his t.v. role again.  The feats that Easy company went through were harrowing and terrifying and I found much of the action difficult to watch for this reason. Much of my viewing was between my fingers since I tried covering my eyes much of the time. Unlike any other war movie I have ever seen I think that this one showed war without propoganda or sentimentality and deserves a place of honor on any viewer's keeper shelf. My hat is off to the members of Easy company and all other war veterans.

0316666343|2.0|Why have so many luminaries and reviewers jumped on this bandwagon?  I just finished reading this novel (though I almost abandoned it several times), and find it one big missed opportunity.  Great concept: murdered girl narrating from heaven the evolution of her surviving family and friends.  But amateurish execution: (1) much of the book is underwritten, in that the characters are mostly cardboard cutouts draped with pathos, and (worst of all) Sebold dangles an intriguing version of heaven and then virtually ignores it for the rest of the book; (2) numerous passages are painfully overwritten; and (3) the story moves forward only with the help of cliche contrivances (e.g. mom comes back after 8 years because dad has had a heart attack? why? we don't know, because Sebold has barely mentioned mom since she left).  Only in the talk-show age could this book garner this degree of favorable notice.  If you want to read something compelling and really ravishing, try &quot;East of Eden.&quot;

B00005QIPH|5.0|joe sack London 14/12/2002 <BR>Before the strokes I was living on the likes of nirvana and the early offspring. I was being carried along by the \\"yoof of today's\\" choice in music depressing and an attitude to \\"smash things up\\". Then one night after seeing the strokes nonchauntly launch into \\"is this it\\" on the brits (the U.K's largest awards ceremony) I purchased is this it. After listening to \\"is this it\\"(the song) on playback I put it back on my CD shelf. About 6 months later the strokes started to get great reviews I listened to the strokes again and all the songs started to make sense the lyrics were so clear and meaningful I felt Julian Casablanca's was belting out my life on cd . the repetitive guitar is quite fitting to the kind of music that is being played retro and very 1990 trance but this means you can focus more on Julian Casablanca's singing most of the songs are about a teenager who doesn't [care] being put in situations about sex mistakes and retrospect of his past if you've had an interesting life you will relate to at least one of the strokes songs the lyric   CANT YOU SEE IM TRYING I DONT EVEN LIKE YOU I JUST LIED TO GET TO YOUR APPARTMENT will jog some peoples memory . After listening to this album after coming home from school I feel happy and rejuvenated. These selections of songs also come in to play if your feeling sad like Soma and Alone Together soma is about the bad effects of drugs and alone together is about a relation ship with a friend who is an alcoholic. This album is a minor aphrodisiac or an Asparin after work trust me buy this album it wont sound that good at first but listen to the album persevere and you will be rewarded with the finest collection of songs 2001 or 2002 for that matter has ever seen a fine christmas gift <br />Joe sack
B000002B7O|5.0|Ozzy and Co. are back and ready to prove to the world that his solo career is serious.  Randy Rhoads (may God rest his soul) deserves to be ranked with guitar geniouses such as Jimmy Page and Eddie Van Halen and his talent is definetly showcased on Diary of a Madman.  This album had the successful hits &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Flying High Again&quot; (witch I find eerie that Randy sings, &quot;I can see it, I can see it&quot;, because he would meet his demise in that tragic plane accident on March 19). I also love &quot;Little Dolls&quot; and the garage-jam, &quot;Believer&quot; (although the guitar solo is very reminiscent to the first solo on &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; from Blizzard Of Ozz). But by far the best track, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, is an awesome piece of rock 'n roll history. Every time that i hear it, chills run through my spine. The intro with the doubled clean tone and acoustic guitar are sheer genious and then comes in the heavily distorted electric guitar that spins this song around and just proves how great Randy Rhoads was. I personally find this song very similar to Led Zeppelin's holy grail, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (not intending to be blasphemous). What a great final studio song for Randy to leave us with. This cd is a must for any rock connoisseur. I cannot possibly stress how much I love this cd. I hope people don't quickly judge Ozzy (musically) on the Blizzard of Ozz track Crazy Train, albeit this is one of my favorite songs, the mainstream has exploited this classic too much. To really get a taste of what Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley and Lee Keerslake can really do, definetly buy Diary of a Madman.
B00006690G|5.0|As Eminem continues to wrestle the media, his life, and his enemies, he puts it all on wax on \\"Show\\", a surreal look into his life. I remembered Eminem when his music was humorous. He was the equivalent of Redman, but not as good as Big L with the punchlines. After 2000's Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem couldn't go anywhere but down. But I was wrong. Eminem has flipped his own style and made a milestone record that shows great lengths of maturation. He's no longer stabbing gays, popping purple pills or smoking fat pounds of grass. This is the new Eminem we're most likely going to see for the next few years. <br />From semi-political (White America) to repetitive (Business & Without Me), the majority of the album is a darker Marshall Mathers. Here, he's saying something of resonance and thankfully his fans are still here waiting for him to say something that will piss people off. Well, he doesn't get anywhere near that level (maybe to Jermaine Dupri and Tipper Gore), but he joins Ja Rule in the Rapper Who Sings genre (Hallie's Song), but the only difference between him and that clown is that he says \\"I can't sing.\\" The song comes off as touching and thankfully he raps on the third verse.<br />If you're a fan of Eminem, you'll notice he has easily slipped into his new style of rapping under the radar. But for the casual listener, they'll say, \\"Where's the homophobic references?\\" Now the question remains where can Eminem go after this album? He's already dissed Benzino rather well, but if he starts rapping about his movie experience, his albums will turn into the likes of Star Trek movies, or worse, Ja Rule albums.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was... amazing!I loved it!... As my title says, it's fast, flashy, and incredibly tragic. Ewan McGregor did excellent (as always) and Nicole Kidman was brillant. <BR>   The music was exceptional and Nicole and Ewan have very good voices!!! The music just makes the whole movie come together, it would be nothing without it.<BR>   You laugh, you cry, and sometimes you just want to yell at the characters... If you haven't seen it already or don't own this DVD, you should! With this DVD you can get a behind the scenes look at what went into the makin of this truly exquisite film.
B000001FNL|5.0|This may be the top of the list of BeeGees albums. With many great hits and a sweet variety of tunes, each and every song deserves a ten out of ten star rating. Starting with my top pick and also 2nd overall favorite BeeGees song, Nights On Broadway. This original version is better than any and is so, so sweet. Also considered a great hit is my second pick Fanny Be Tender. I love the chorus and its one of Barry's bests. All This Making Love is more of a hard rock change of tune and Edge of The Universe is a sad nice little tune, rather long. Wind of Change is another hit although wished to be sung a bit clearer. There's also Country Lanes and Come on Over, each great ballads in their own way. More of a country for Come On Over. Baby As You Turn Away is just outstanding and all three of them use a great harmony in the chorus. Songbird has awesome instruments and a great harmonic tune towards the end. Then there's Jive Talkin, a big hit at the time in the U.S., written on account of a train track. Still a top song. Put together these great hits and you've got a masterpiece in Main Course.
0425173755|5.0|This is it. The daddy of all mysteries. Buy it, read it, love it. And Then There Was None is a great novel too, but I'd like someone to solve that one. This is a fair play mystery, with lots of great caracters, suspence, atmosphere. And you have a chance at guessing the bad guy!
B00004Y7SF|1.0|After reading alot of the reviews on this board I am convinced that most of the people writing reviews are Christina's die hard fans. I personally have never bought any of her other cds and after having heard this will never buy another cd of hers again. It is the least sincere christmas album I have ever heard. I have heard Christina say many times how she wants everybody to know that she has true talent and can sing.First of all I think one of the things she has forgotten is that songwriters have written these songs. The songs have lyrics.
B00006690H|4.0|Through basic curiosity I bought this CD. I had been an Eminem HATER for a couple of years, viewing his music as another ranting white American with a middle-class grudge against society. <br />First listen, opinion re-enforced. Second listen, hmmmmm, the lyrics are not bad. Third listen, nice beats. Fourth listen, ok, this is actually quite good. By the fifth listen, the CD had made it into my very exclusive top 50 CD's of the moment shelf. <br />Believe me, to make that jump in my music world takes some doing.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I can say with all confidence that this is the worst album I have ever heard in all my life. Every time I hear this I strangely get a headache out of nowhere. I was watching the Osbornes the other day and they were talking about how horrible this album was. I couldn't agree more. This is the album for you if you want to take the Christmas time warmth out of Christmas.When you listen to this it is as if Christina is screaming at you. You forget what the lyrics are to Oh holy night, because it's supposedly all about her voice and how many notes she can sing. I will always remember this album for the worst album ever created.If you like this then the Osbornes and me feel bad for you.
B00005U122|5.0|From the intro the the finale this is classic. Roger can still sing too.

The style that they have is extrodinary berts vocals tear through you with so much passion and lift you off the ground with great lyrics and if im not mistaken the whole band does vocals i believe and they are just friggin awesome and I hope to meet them dec.19 Vanderbilt NY
B00005YUNY|5.0|That was my first impression when viewing this DVD. But the band with the symphony is marvelous. And much to my surprise Jon Anderson get most all of the high notes. Of the three DVD's I've seen of the band I think this one is the best.
0140186409|1.0|I had to read this book for a college class, and I hated it. I do see the significance in the book, but I do not find it interesting. I would not recommend this book to anyone, read something like Black Girl Lost, The Coldest Winter Ever, Flyy Girl, Liars Game, Push, American Dreams... books like that are Highly Recommended...
0316776963|5.0|Though I didn't find it laugh out loud hilarious, the stories in this book were all very entertaining and amusing in a snickering sort of way.  Sedaris's family seems to be full of some unique and strange characters, and his accounts of his and their exploits are well delivered.  I plan to try his other books.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is the KINO VIDEO version of the movie METROPOLIS. Currently there are a number of prints of this DVD out, but most of them utilize 16mm prints that are often grainy and blurry... which is NOT a good tribute to what is considered one of the greatest sci fi movies ever. The Kino video offers a beautiful soundtrack as well as a clear, near pristine 35mm print in its version.<br />The Kino version also contains a very thorough movie, which, once again, is absent in most prints. Weeks after METROPOLIS was shown, it was cut drastically. Kino has released the most- complete version to date, using footage that was from some of the cut to enhance and explain the story. Parts of the movie that have been lost, presumably forever, are explained through intertitles. The story makes much more sense and offers a great deal more depth now.<br />I cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone who loves silent film or science fiction.
B000001FDP|5.0|I bought this album when I was 15, being a Vangelis fan as a teenager.  This is an improvement over his album &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1975), which has, I think, more a mixture of good &amp; bad work on it.  I personally think this album is even better than Mythodea.  Unfortunately, it seems that Soil Festivities &amp; mask are highly underrated.<br />Mask (1985) on the other hand, shows Vangelis at his peak.  Only Soil Festivities (1984) beats this album.  Like SF, Mask is divided up into six movements (the disc for SF says 5 movements - but the original LP I had listed 6, the disc combines 5 &amp; 6 into one final movement - must've been a typo).  Like Heaven &amp; Hell and Mythodea, this disc has Vangelis performing with a chorus, singing this sort of Esperanto-syllabic &quot;lyrics.&quot;  Vangelis supplies his own electronic &quot;orchestra.&quot;<br />Needless to say, Yanni it ain't!  Six movements ranging from a terrifying hurricane to simple stately hymns, very &quot;pagan&quot; in nature.  The music is very dramatic, and suggestive to me of maybe The Iliad or maybe Sophocles' tragedies.<br />If you want some great classic Vangelis, pick this one up - it is a real treat!
B00005QDW1|3.0|There are a few good songs on here, but you don't hear Gwen's song-writing voice as much as I'd like.
B000002MG1|5.0|the answer is... no, Out of Time, for me although not as refined has a greater range of sounds. When i first listened to this album, i thought it was miles ahead of Out of Time, but after a while it sounds too REM-ish. However i have found that if i listen to it less often i like it more. This is a fantastic album, but they've made it so good, that you get sick of how good it is. Personally i like some very good songs in between good songs. If you don't mind an album which is very good for 50 mins then buy this album. Otherwise buy it with Out of Time, to make it a bit easier to listen to.
B000066NW0|3.0|A few good songs, but she needs some polishing as a song-writer.  I can't wait to hear her next stuff.
B000001Y42|3.0|Well, i really think that Limp Bizkit used to be a good band back when this CD came out. This CD has some great music, but somewhere along the line, they got the idea that they were better than everyone else and started putting out sh#t. I understand that it's very easy to get wrapped up in the indrustry, but these guys got overboard after awhile. I reccomend this one, but don't waste your hard earned cash on any other &quot;Bizkit&quot; albums.

Of course this only gives me greater insight into what is wrong with the world today. If you are in search of a good read only, then just move on, because, while yes, you will most certainly find it here, but if that is all you are in search of or find, then you already truly missed the boat. <br />This piece of work is the true definition of sharing. This is a person who passed 5 years prior to my birth and I feel as if I know her. Not only is this book well written, but also it is written with her heart and soul. <br />I know that this was a book written to make money, to allow a writer to keep writing. But true to Sylvia's style, it is a deeply personal book that sheds a lot of light on her actual life for the person reading between the lines, or for the person who actually cares. <br />If you are looking to have a better understanding of depression, and how it works, then sign up for a class. If you have to ask if there is a point, then you clearly wouldn't know the difference either way. If you think that reading a lot of books makes you an expert then you are a sad case. <br />This book is about making connection with the person who wrote it. True, you shouldn't feel obligated to like everything that some one writes just because they are a literary genius, but to dismiss it as if it were a Dean Koontz book with a bad plot only shows the lack of depth within your own cranium.
B00006YXJ4|5.0|Here it is folks, the last officially recorded gem from the last ex-Beatle that meant a damn, and guess what...It's ACTUALLY GOOD.<BR>George Harrison's \\"BRAINWASHED\\" is his first solo record in 15 years (since 1987's \\"CLOUD NINE\\"), and while it also carries the stigma of being another posthumous album in a sea of \\"last\\" albums, it has none of the \\"finish it off, slap it out for christmas\\" characterizations that plague many other releases. BRAINWASHED was lovingly completed by George's son, Dhani, and his longtime collaberator/friend JEFF LYNNE. The trio together have crafted an album of such beauty and integrity that, BRAINWASHED is the career bookend to Harrison's ALL THINGS MUST PASS released over 30 years ago. The elder Harrison confronts his own mortality on songs like \\"Pisces Fish\\", \\"Looking For My Life\\", \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\", and embraces all life on \\"Any Road\\" whilst simultaneously criticising the material lust of the western civilization on \\"Brainwashed\\" the record's title track. All the trademark Harrison elements are here; The chiming guitars; the liquid leads; the sardonic lyrics; the gorgeous harmonies; and yes...the Hindu mysticism. Speaking of material lust in the western civilzation...buy this disc already!!!

B00005OAIE|5.0|I purchased this CD after reading on a Message Board so much about this Guy. I LOVED it!!!!! I recommend it for anyone that can remember the group GO WEST (hit songs were \\"Call Me\\", \\"King of Wishful Thinking\\" and their remake of \\"What you won't do for Love\\" back in the 80's) I hear that he is compared a lot to Dave Matthews but I didn't pick up on that.<br />Their are at least 4 good songs on this CD after listening to it twice in a row the evening I purchased it I went to work and burned it too LOL Definately a great gift idea.
0201485672|5.0|Even after working with OO technology for years, I got new insights into OO after reading this book and now write better code than every before.  If you told me I could only keep one of my computer books (and I have a lot) this would be the one.<br />Nicely organized into short (2-4 page) design patterns that describe step by step techniques for changing from a suboptimal design to a better one, you can learn a new technique that will immediately become part of your coding repertoire in just a few minutes.  <br />To increase the power of the techniques you learn, you can use some of the new coding tools (such as TogetherSoft or jBuilder with the Refactory add-in) that automate these refactorings, so you can transform a whole block of code with just a few keystrokes.<br />Buy this book!
6305508550|5.0|One day I was wandering around the local video rental and I saw this on the shelf. I picked it up and noticed the names of Mike Judge and Jennifer Aniston and that have made me rent this movie, I didn't have any other on my mind and I didn't risk much taking this one. And that way I've discovered one of the best comedies since Monty Python's Life of Brian. Great satirical view on today's work and life. I haven't seen such funny American comedy in years, with such a taste of humor (not like American Pie or Scary Movie), without jokes about farting, vommitting and sperm. At last a intelligent film with great dialogs and few worthy observations of American society.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I was first introduced to Laura Pausini with the song SEAMISAI from Le Cose Che Vivi while enrolled in a Italian course at college. From then on, I was hooked on one of the world's most talented vocalist. Laura's voice knows how to capture your inner emotion, whether it is filled with love or simply heartbroken. It is amazing to see an artist carry that same vocal power in any language. From The Inside proves that Laura can capture any sentiment regardless of which tongue she decides to use. Songs like I Need Love, Do I Dare, and Without You are signature Laura. For those of you are that familiar with her work will recongize the \\"oooohhhh\\" she uses in You Are when jumping from the chorus to the second verse. Simply amazing! Contrary to popular belief, Every Day Is A Monday was not a translation of a previous hit, it was origionally written in English and later released as Il Mio Sbaglio Piu Grande/Un Error de los Grandes. The only disappointment I have is the lack of air play and video play that Laura is getting in the US. If you decide to purchase this cd you will not be sorry. Give this already proven world-wide superstar a try, if you are new to Laura get her The Best Of.../Lo Mejor de... cd, it showcases the best this amazing singer has to offer.
B00006DEFA|5.0|It was 1984 when F. Murray Abraham walked away with an Oscar for his performance as the sinister, jealous and vengeful Antonio Salieri. The cast includes Tom Hulce as Mozart, whose first name was Amadeus and hence the title of the film, Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife Constanza, and Christine Ebersole (of Broadway musicals) who plays the voluptuous prima donna Katarina Cavalieri. The visuals on this film are striking, effectively dark some scenes, festive in others, a splendid production by director Milos Forman (director of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest). Not only is this quality drama, winning Best Picture, but a great introduction to the music of the greatest Classical composer of his time, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br />Partially true to historical account, Amadeus serves as an interesting historic drama as well as psychological drama. There is no solid evidence to prove that Vienna's court composer Salieri was responsible for the death of Mozart. Fictional plays by twentieth century author Peter Shaffer and the source that inspired him, a Russian writer, Pushkin's, play \\"Mozart And Salieri\\" tell that Salieri was bent on revenge and Mozart's death simply because he was intensely jealous of his musical genius and popularity, where as his own compositions sank into obscurity. There is also no truth to Salieri's descent into madness. Salieri was Mozart's contemporary and a successful composer, having numerous works to his credit, including religious chorales and 40 operas. But in the psychological drama that ensues in the film, Salieri's dark character is deliciously revealed. There is a scene in which he burns a crucifix (Salieri himself was a devout Catholic) and vows before God: \\"Because you choose for your instrument a vulgar, sinful boy, I will make sure to destroy your incarnation!.\\" At his most darkest, Salieri plans Mozart's death through his Requiem, an exhausting and consuming funeral mass that took a heavy toll on Mozart, whose health had always been afflicted with alcohol and a frivolous party lifestyle.<br />The musical score is all Mozart. This is a great introduction to classical music, although in this case, specifically Mozart. Most of his great hits are here, including his operas Abduction From The Seraglio, Le Nozze Di Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute. Among his instrumental music are his Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor, Flute And Harp Concerto, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and his Symphony 25, which opens the film. All in all, this is a terrific DVD, with behind the scenes looks and director's cuts. Watch, listen and learn.
0066214122|5.0|The best science fiction has always been somewhat preachy. In the fifties we were warned on atomic dangers (\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\") and in the seventies, environmental terror was a frequent theme.<br />Now Crichton warns us against the intersection of technology, computer science and biology in a masterful work reminiscent of Hitchcock's The Birds. Swarms of microscopic molecular computers which are programmed to mimic predators in the wild, rapidly evolve into shaft shifting artificial organisms which threaten the survival of their human creators.<br />Jack Forman, recently unemployed software engineer, finds life as a fulltime stay at home dad frustrating especially since his wife's career in nanotechnology is spectacularly successful. Unknown to Jack his program which mimics predator/prey behavior has been incorporated in his wife's product. <br />After something goes terribly wrong Jack is dispatched to reign in the mutating artificial creatures. It is a trip fraught with danger and clever plot twists.<br />Alfred Hitchcock would have made a hell of a movie out of this one!
B00000761W|5.0|The cast of this CD is the true blue whitesnake. I can't think of a more defining release of the 1000+ rock releases, I have heard that defines the term &quot;Blues Rock&quot;. This is top of the line Rock Blues.  Great melodies, perfected instrumentation and Coverdale at peak performance. Don't delay if you don't have this recording in your rock collection.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|This movie was OK...  What made MIB work was Tommy Lee Jones' dry yet cocky confidence and Will Smith's shock at the whole concept always trying to play cool and always 2 steps behind the master Man in Black (Tommy)...  <br />Sadly, in MIB-2 Tommy is a waste case, never really taking charge,  Head Quarters is infiltrated as easy as holding up a McDonalds (HOW COULD THIS BE...?)  and we are left with Will Smith to carry the load through most of the movie (Love you Will but you aint all that...)  <br />I'll keep rewatching the first movie and hope for a MUCH BETTER MIB 3...!
630562285X|2.0|This movie was OK. Just OK. There was really no excitement in it- the last Y2K scam scene was really pretty badly done. But the part of this movie really bugs me is that Sean Connery is so old!!!!! I don't mean he's too old to be acting or whatever, he just seems so perverted in this movie (jones/connery sex: the most disgusting thing i could think of and never want to see again). Let's not add to the other fact: there's absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads. But whatever: if you're a die hard action fan and don't mind watching sean connery make out on the floor with catherine zeta jones, this movie's pretty good.
B00003CXE7|5.0|To movie-lovers and casual viewers alike, this movie is a must-own. With a perfect balance of action, drama, and plot, it is no wonder that this movie was an Academy Award-Winner. Though this movie may be a bit violent for younger viewers, it is nothing over-the-top. Overall, if you own a DVD player, you must own this movie.
B00006RU5B|3.0|With the somewhat return of the former Rage Against the Machine members guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk, minus frontman Zack de la Rocha comes a sometimes interesting mix of the infamous single-line, double octave Rage riffs with a mid-ninties post-Seattle grunge feel.  With the exit of de la Rocha, enter former grunge forerunner Soundgarden's lead vocalist Chris Cornell.  Cornell definiately brings his own brand of vocals and lyrics and unabrashed delivery to this effort.  A quick spin of the  songs &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; and &quot;What You Are&quot; are unmistakely Seattle grunge a la Soundgarden, even borderline Pearl Jam-ish so much that you could almost hear Eddie Vedder himself.  While those of us who sort of grew up on this style, it is pleasantly surprising.  However, with such current modern rock bands like Puddle of Mudd, Sum 41, Papa Roach and Distrubed topping the charts, the music sometimes sounds dated.  The most commanding statement comes right from the get-go with &quot;Cochise&quot; and provides the reassurance that the most powerful part of the former Rage Against the Machines sound remains where it has always been: with the rhythm section.  Those powerful riffs from Morello and company with ensure that this will be &quot;the song&quot; to roll your windows down to remind you neighbors that underneath that Monday through Friday 9-5 business casual demeanor there lies a true rocker.  Other than that the remaining songs seem to get lost in a clash between a band that doesn't know where it wants to go.  There is definiately a song writing chemistry that needs to be polished before Audioslave becomes a band with a voice.  At certain points, it feels like Cornell forces his vocals into a senario that doesn't like the fit.  If there is a superb, although surely unrecognized and grossly underlying point a which to build upon it is the amazing effort by guitarist Tom Morello.  His ability to move beyond the his distrinct role in Rage to create a virtual canvas of sound as he moves from a huge wall of thick overdriven guitars to subtle accompanyment from song to song says that this band could go in any number of direction as longs as it's member get focused on which direction that is.  All in all Audioslave is a fine debut worth a listen, while we all sit and wait for the, hopefully hasty but not rushed, second effort.  Rating &quot;C&quot;.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I will indeed buy the DVD when it comes out!  I am not a real Trekie, my husband is. However, I found this movie to be spell binding and I loved every second of it!  It's very exciting, action packed and not predictable as I thought it might be.  It has all the usual quality and good acting of the original cast.  I would give it six stars if I could.  I highly recommend it!!
6301247485|4.0|Whenever a classic novel is put to film, there is a tendency for the reader to place the words on the page to the action on the screen.  In THE GREAT GATSBY, director Jack Clayton had the uneviable task of transferring a novel that relied heavily on cultural theme and overt symbolism to a medium that required cinematographic sleight of hand to simulate Fitzgerald's symbols that channeled a post war Depression age fascination with the Great American Dream that somehow went very wrong following the stock market crash in 1929.  To this post war America that tasted the delights inherent in fulfilling the Dream, THE GREAT GATSBY slowly began to resonate with a reading public that saw that the vulgar displays of wealth in a typical Gatsby party were but the prescursors of the tragic loss of that wealth.  As I watched the movie unfold, I could see that the filmed version did not try to catch the more subtle psychological nuances of the book.  Rather, director Clayton focused the audience's attention on what could be seen and heard.  THE GREAT GATSBY is a two hour plus ensemble of sight and sound that very nearly catches the quick of the jazz age of the twenties.  Most of the first half is full of jitterbugging dancers and clangorous music that is so full of life that I barely noticed that the tunes belonged to a different age.  Amidst this panorama of dance, song, flapper style clothes, and Model T cars, lies the essential business of the book.  Robert Redford as Gatsby exactly details a man who could conquer the world of crime with an unerring eye for detail but must fail in judging the reality of a woman right in front of his eyes.  Mia Farrow as Daisy has been unfairly pilloried for being too whiny and too bony to cause a man to remake a world in his own image merely to win her.  But her seeming lack of beauty is exactly the point.  Had Gatsby been perceptive enough to see Daisy as she really was, then he would not have tried to alter a present to bring a past into hisconcept of a future.  For reasons of his own, Gatsby chooses to make Daisy the center of his universe, and in so doing unknowingly transforms the accepted American Dream of hard work leading to riches to one in which that very hard work can lead only to pain and loss.  Had a more voluptuous actress played Daisy, then Gatsby's reaching for her would have him stand for nothing but himself.  In reaching for Mia Farrow-Daisy, Gatsby reaches beyond her for the ideal of desire that rang so true in the novel. <br />Further complicating director Clayton's task was Fitzgerald's use of a narrator-participant to filter the action to the reader.  Sam Waterston as Nick is terrific as the starry-eyed bond trader who is the only character to learn from the character faults of everyone around him, including Gatsby, whom he labels as 'worth more than the whole damn bunch of them.' In both book and film, Nick is passive but alert.  He sees as clearly as do the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, who presides god-like over the valley of ashes that Gatsby calls home.  Bruce Dern as Tom, Daisy's brute husband does a convincing performance despite his lacking the bulkiness that bothers so many critics of the movie.  Dern has made a career of playing psychos and creeps, so he is perfectly cast as the thuggish Tom.  Karen Black as Myrtle steals the show as Tom's mistress, a woman who is ultimately seen as more unhappily flawed than any other character.  <br />THE GREAT GATSBY is a treat for the eye and ear, even if not for a mind that comes to the screen with many of Fitzgerald's memorable quotes lingering on the lips.  What emerges at the end is a flashing green light that signifies to both Nick and the viewer that any vision that is worth having must not be degraded by sharing it with another who may have a competing and mutually exclusive dream of her own.  Tragically, for every Gatsby there are dozens of Daisys.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I don't know how to describe what a brilliant movie this is. It would be horrific to try to describe it, there is no way to do it justice. It's easily the most mind blowing movie I have ever seen. It touched me on so many levels with its genius. Every one must see this movie. I've seen it five times and each time I find more to marvel at.
B000075BFK|3.0|Don't get we wrong, I'm among the ones that consider 2Pac's to be the greatest rapper ever. And this album, even more than \\"Until The End Of Time\\" shows that there's very little between what the songs sound and the way 2Pac intented them to sound. We all know the reason for that - bootleging and the original songs that all appeared on the net. And that's what ruined it for every 2Pac fan who waits to buy the original album. I admit that some of the songs sound REAL tight, but so many of them sound like nothing 2Pac would agree too. For example, the song \\"Military Minds\\" - you hear 2Pac screaming his [butt] off, and rapping with so much rage, and the beat is slow and very laid back. It's almost ridiculous... There's NO WAY the original sounded like that. Or s song like \\"Fair Exchange\\" - it's one of those 2Pac freaky songs. So it should get a WICKED beat, not a playful one it got on this album. And I ain't even talking about adding rappers Pac never met on the songs (and for God's sake - NAS!???!? Come on!!...Pac HATED him!!! ...). I am not a hater, and I'm glad to get ANYTHING by Pac, cause hearing him rap is enough!... But to know that we could get the songs as they were recorded by the artist himself would be so much better. But some people killed this hope for us, so I'll have to be plesed with this one. The first CD is good, almost all of it is only great songs. The second one is dissapointing, and the reason is the beats of course - to RnB like, too much guitar on them, too changed... But anyway, if you're a true Pac fan, get this one as well, it's obvious the label is running out of full and quality songs and this is one of our last chances to hear something related to the greates rapper of all time...
6304698658|5.0|If you have yet to see this movie, my advise would be to go out and rent it or better yet, buy it.  This instant classic will be one you'll watch every year for years to come.  Fun for the whole family!
B000002J1H|2.0|I'm starting to think that Yes are never going to top their progressive masterpiece CLOSE TO THE EDGE.  Though the only other Yes album I have -- 90125 -- comes close to it (and that's a commercial album for Pete's sake!), GOING FOR THE ONE does nothing to prove my theory wrong.  This is Yes at one of their more weaker moments.  The majority of this record is uninspired and unsatisfying.  Though it has its share of beautiful pieces, as to be expected of Yes' music, GOING FOR THE ONE should have been renamed &quot;Too Low for Zero.&quot;<br />The sole reason this album is any good is because of two songs: &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; and &quot;Parallels.&quot;  These two songs save the album from being a total disaster, and are two of Yes' finest tunes if I do say so myself.  &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; is a lovely 7-minute ballad with some of the most poignant lyrics Jon Anderson has ever written.  Telling the story of a sculptor who is making a clay statue after his dead wife, the emotional acoustic work of Steve Howe, melodic vocal harmonies, and triumphant ending reasonate through the song very well.<br />&quot;Parallels&quot; is a harder-rocking cut, with a bombastic yet cool organ intro from Rick Wakeman (who returned to the band for this album after a three-year absence), tasty basslines from Chris Squire, and a catchy chorus.  Nicely done.  Besides these two tracks, it's all downhill from there.<br />The opening title track starts with a rollicking country-esque intro from Howe and seems to be throbbing with energy, but the annoying chorus grows so damn repetitive and diminshes any quality the song had.  Anderson's vocals are at their worst here.  &quot;Wonderous Stores&quot; is a filler ballad, not very memorable at all.  &quot;Awaken&quot; is the long epic of the album, reaching 15 minutes.  Surprisingly, it lacks the scope and ambition of Yes' previous epics like &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; or &quot;Starship Trooper.&quot;  All that build-up for what?  A repeat of the beginning for the last 4 minutes?  Come on, guys.  You could do better than that.<br />Before I close out, I must say that the production of this album is awful.  Howe's guitar and Squire's bass are so loud during some of the songs that Wakeman's keys and Alan White's drums can hardly be heard.  And Jon Anderson's usually high voice can't soar above the loud guitars.  GOING FOR THE ONE is a disappointment from a band capable of so much more.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I think that this is probably one of the greatest movies of all time. The scope and vision that it took to make such a movie as this is amazing to me, to say the very, very least. If you are a serious film student, or interested in the history of American film, then this is a must see for you.<br />Those who contend that this film is nothing more than self glorification of hollywood and it's many characters have either a) missed the point or b)failed to appreciate it.<br />In the former case, I think that the individuals who criticize it without understanding it are looking at it through modern day spectacle eyes, trying to see it as something that is supposed to be entertaining and have a point. The 'point' is simply that our own lives seem so complicated and big, but break down to a few moments that we hang on to forever, maybe without anyone else even knowing. That is what life is. Other movies try to glorify life or make it something that it is not...why do you think they have the line 'I always wanted to say this...', it's because in real life you can't...real life is dishes and bills. That what citizen kane struck me as, dishes and bills. Truth.<br />The later group is the noveau cliche type, those who think that art is some underground thing that only they and a few others know about. Bad news for you folks is this: there were a lot more renaisance painters than leonardo, but he survived because so many liked and appreciated his works. Others claimed that there were other artists who had a better scope or understood 'art for art' better than that master...question is, where are they now? If your vision of art is so much better than the masses, then why isn't it in the masses? That is my answer to those reviewers look at this movie; that this (movie) is the type of art that reflects the culture it came from, that will survive as a reflection of that culture. There are hundreds of others, true, but they failed on the simple basis of broad blanketing of social capture. My personal favorite is Pygmalion, but I'm no fool to think it will be shown in history classes years from now as explanation of our times.<br />In short...see this film, love or hate, ignore or appreciate it...it will be there as testament no matter what your opinion.ture.

B00005JL2O|1.0|First of all I'm a huge Mike Myers fan. I loved the Waynes World movies and Austin 1 and 2. But I feel something went terribly wrong here. This movie doesn't have one single laugh to its name. There's only one person to blame for this mess and that is of course Mike Myers. He does a terrible job at playing his own characters. His Dr. Evil isn't even Dr. Evil anymore. It's just Mike myers with makeup. He doesn't inhabit Dr. Evil's mannerisms that made the first two so funny. He just recycles the jokes from the first two. And worst of all AUSTIN DOESN'T SHAG IN THIS MOVIE. What's up with that. And don't get me started on Beyonce Knowles. Her performance makes Heather Graham look like Meryl Streep. The character Goldmember is disgusting, not funny. The twist at the end is enough to make anyone who likes this series ashamed that they paid money to watch this mess.<br />It's time Mike Myers puts Austin to rest for good. Any movie that has a dance sequence with Britney Spears at the beginning is pretty desperate for laughs. Most people that say that they like this movie don't want to admit how disappointing it is. It's truly terrible. I didn't go to the movies for four months after seeing this. I was that disappointed. If you like the first two Austin movies, don't watch this by any means. You'll lose respect for the whole franchise and filmmaking itself. Avoid this movie at all costs.
0375414053|4.0|Kate Reddy is not your typical working mother. She has a glamorous job (she admits she may go abroad three times a month) and has a minicab to pick her up to work instead of taking the Underground. She doesn't get treated as well as she likes, but she is very successful and well respected by most at her work place.  She has a full time, live in nanny and enough money to hire whatever needs to be done. Because she is so lucky, I found her whining to be a lttle unrealistic and the sporadic illustrations of the difficult time women have in the of world of work to be a little sanctimonious.  I was also disappointed to see her reject the man's world. I fully expected Kate to end up running her firm instead of leaving it because a woman with a family could never truly succeed in the environment.  Nevertheless, this was a fun book to read, if only for the use of British terms.

B000000OUJ|5.0|Believe it or not, Gza is actually one of my least favorite clansmen, behind maybe only Cappadonna and U-God. However even I can't deny that this is a great album. It is a little overrated, I have read that it is \\"the perfect album\\", far from it, but still a great album. Gza really is nice on the mic, I just prefer other rappers over him because he doesn't ever really get hyped, and the tone of his voice never changes, but some people are into that. Anyways, the production is another great aspect of this album. It was made while the Rza was at his prime, so you know its laced with some of the tightest beats. Even if every other song on this album was terrible, it would still be worth buying just to hear the song \\"Labels\\" which is, quite possibly, the best rap song of all time. Gza incorporates each record label's name into his rap to form verses that actually make sense, and the beat is one of the tightest on the cd. Thankfully, that isn't the only great song, and there are many more, so if you want to get into Wu Tang, first buy Enter The Wu Tang: 36 Chambers, then this.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ever since the first time I heard John Mayer's first single, &quot;No Such Thing&quot; on VH1 I knew I'd like this guy.  &quot;Room For Squares&quot; surprised me when I put it in my CD player and the CD got better and better with every song.  As a high school senior, I am used to and surrounded by the nasal voice of Britney Spears and the pop beats of The Backstreet Boys just about 24/7.  It's a breath of fresh air in this pop-marketed music industry to actually see some raw talent, and John Mayer provides just that.  The lyrics that flow throughout &quot;Room For Squares&quot; range from John's high school dreams of making it big in &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, to his childhood memories in &quot;83&quot;, to his attempt to find &quot;Mrs. Right&quot; in &quot;Love Song For No One&quot;.  Though all of these songs on this CD are different and tell different stories, all 13 have two things in common; they give us insight into a very interesting man and they all come from the heart.  John Mayer writes lyrics that truly express &quot;the human condition&quot;, if you will, and he's on his way to being a major superstar.  If you want some music with some real substance, this is the CD for you.
0517193647|5.0|Sarcastic, profane,slovenly, sometimes drunk, doesnt have perfect grooming habits and dress's badly, these are some of the descriptions that fit Belgarath. This book details the events that made him \\"The Eternal Man\\". Possibly the best conceived sorcerer in literature, Belgarath will certainly take a seat in history next to Gandorf, Obe-one, and Maadi. Some have complained that the book has \\"slow\\" spots. Well thats kinda like life, years of boredom, sixty seconds of terror. If every second of every day was heart stopping, even Belgarath would eventually give up. What I really liked was the fact that this book could stand alone. Even if I had never read the Belgarid/Mallorean series, I would have still enjoyed and understood this book. It has found a permanent place in my collection of \\"Keepers\\". I highly reccommend this book to everyone.
B00000K0DT|5.0|What earns a film the characterisation \\"classic\\"? First and foremost a great script. Check, then. The \\"Usual Suspects\\" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether.            <BR>       A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called \\"Keyser Sose\\", and the story being told in retrospect by \\"Verbal\\" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.<BR>    As you try to make sense out of what \\"verbal\\" says (while the \\"facts\\" keep constantly changing and \\"verbal\\" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is \\"who is Keyser Sose\\"? And, exactly because \\"Keyser\\" could be any of a number of \\"suspects\\", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.<BR>     And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the \\"Usual suspects\\" or a true fan of cinema.<BR>    But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of \\"Verbal\\" is sharply inspiring.<BR>   But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.<BR>    The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can \\"exist\\". A scenery dark and intimidating like the character in question. The main element is the fear everyone seems to out over \\"Sose\\" but at the same time noone knows for sure what he does or what he is. The most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's \\"right hand\\" the enigmatic \\"Mr. Kobayashi\\" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers.<BR>Mindblowing film. Puts the \\"C\\" into classic.
B000023VR6|5.0|Although this technically isn't Dr. Dre's first release since The Chronic (There was a compilation album called Aftermath in between) it is his first &quot;solo&quot; release (although it is basically a compilation album also), and needless to say, it more than lives up to expectaqtions. Most of the songs have excellent production and the ones that aren't excellent are at least acceptable, and even though the lyrics aren't anything special, they are good enough for the beats that Dre provides. The second half of the album is no where close to as good as the first, especially the 3 quarter, but the album ends with 2 strong tracks, &quot;Bang Bang&quot; and &quot;The Message&quot; which is dedicated to Dre's dead brother. This album was definetly worth the long wait, and if that's what it takes for Dre to make a good album, I'm willing to wait another 8 or so years for his next, as long as it lives up to expectations. If you're into rap music at all, this is a mandatory purchase.
B000009DUY|5.0|Thank you for the Edith Piaf song you inserted into the soundtrack. I have now listened to other recordings by this artist.All I can say is you should hear her sing La Vie en Rose and you will know why she was a superstar for her time.

B00005MP58|5.0|At first, I was hesitant to buy this Special Edition of Pride and Prejudice because so many of the reviews on this site were negative (This was at the beginning of 2002.) There were complaints about the images being too washed out, etc.  But, luckily, I bought it anyway.  I had never seen Pride and Prejudice before.  I had only caught parts of it when it was airing on A&E, and I never was able to see the very beginning, so I didn't want to watch it in the middle.<br />When my DVD arrived, I popped it in and sat down for 6 hours and watched the entire thing.  I just loved it!!!  I didn't notice any problems with the color on this edition. Some of the scenes are shot in direct sunlight, which may make the characters' faces seemed washed out to some people, but it didn't bother me at all.<br />There aren't a lot of extras on the DVD, but the movie is so great, you don't really need much.  The Behind-the-Scenes featurette is good.   I remember an interview with the actress who played Mrs. Bennett.  They were talking about the first table reading of the script with the actors. At first, no one was really getting into their characters, but then the actress that played Mrs. Bennett started reading her lines just as she imagined her character would say them, and everyone else caught on and really started getting into their parts.<br />I would recommend this edition of the DVD to everyone.  You can't miss with it.  I watch it all the time!!
0385508417|2.0|I was instantly [pulled] into the book when I sat down to read it. However, the more I read the more it seemed predictable, and at the same time lost it's way. I was hoping for a better ending, but instead got exactly what I thought would happen. It seemed Mr. Grisham couldn't think of any other way to end it, or forgot where he was originally headed with this book. It could have made such an impression on people if he had stuck with his idea, but instead he bent to what our culture deems normal....putting the Frosty up on the roof..God forbid we do anything else by our own free will. Too Bad.
B00007E8V4|2.0|System of a Down is probably the best rock band out right now. Their self-titled debut was a weird yet amazing glimpse of rock excellence. The follow-up 'Toxicity' was the best album released last year. This &quot;new&quot; album that features tracks that were left on the cutting room floor, but released because of internet leaks and downloading. This album is the worst they have realesed by far. There are a few songs that keep this album from getting zero stars such as &quot;A.D.D.&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jack&quot;, &quot;Pictures&quot;, &quot;Roulette&quot;, and &quot;Streamline&quot;. Although those 5 standout tracks are excellent songs, the other songs are just so horrible that it practically ruins this album. &quot;Mr. Jack&quot; and &quot;Roulette&quot; (an acoustic song) are masterpieces, and even though I gave this album a bad rating, are reasons alone to get this album.
B000068TPN|4.0|It's hard to rate this movie because it was filled with bloody deaths, but the acting and story are moving.  Thank God my husband was never in Viet Nam.
0790729652|1.0|This movie... in a word; sucked. Do not buy this monstrosity, it was terrible. Good acting and good directing were this movie had going for it. Next to no plot, hardly any action, just... BORING! DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE!!!!!!
B00006CXXU|2.0|This album, in my opinion, defines the entire pop genre of the late 90's and early 00's (and that's not a compliment). Catchy, but substanceless singles piled on to an album, with [bad] filler to fill out space, with sex by the bucketloads to convince [vounerable] teenagers to buy their albums. Ms. Aguilera was tolerable a year ago, but now that the teen pop boom has (thankfully) died out, she resorts to extremely [edgy] behavior to continue to glut the market with her [music]  thereby robbing the limelight from genuinely talented artists... This, however, is [bad]. It seems that Ms. Aguilera seems to think that HER emotions and feelings are the most important thing in the world, which can be evidenced by her lyrics. The whole album just reeks of ... commercial exploitation. Every song seems under a hip-hop format, but the style is blatantly butchered. ... So, Aguilera and her cohorts dilute the form into an extremely commercial, and [poor] mix suited to sell on the market. ... The song \\"I'm OK\\" is a [poor] attempt by Aguilera to inject some feeling into her otherwise monotonous record...                The whole record lacks any creativity. It's almost as if Christina Aguilera thinks that being \\"adult\\" and \\"mature\\" means exploiting your sexuality. Why then do I give it 2 stars? I believe Christina Aguilera is a talented vocalist. She either needs to change her collaboraters, or get her head checked.<BR>                 My final word on this is dont bother buying this. It will only encourage her to make even worse music...
B00005Y1TL|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing it at a friends house... From the first time I heard it I thought \\"I HAVE to have this CD!\\" It is absolutely amazing!

If you even remotely like ambient music..Dammit get this album!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can you give this brilliant album, anything other than 5 stars? Radiohead are one of those unique bands, capable of conjuring up anything from sweet, post-rock melodies, to crushing guitar-driven songs. Yet on this album, you'd be forgiven if you thought they band had given up on guitars. The guitars are still here, buried under an avalanche of odd time signatures, weird special effects, keyboards, cellos, and of course Thom Yorke's nervous vocals. The album's producers must take credit for the fact that the songs do not appear to be \\"crammed\\" (Sigur Ros's latest offering comes to mind). Instead, intricacies are revealed after repeated listens, and that's always a sign of a great album. <BR>                    All this experimentation would have gone to waste, however, and this is what make Radiohead so great. They turn a bunch of songs that are way ahead of their time, tinker around with it (using the above mentioned experimentation), and come up with a bunch of songs which are at heart, strong and accesible. Wheter it is the lurching guitars or the opener, \\"Airbag\\", or the multi-segmented rock epic, \\"Paranoid Android\\", to the doomy crawl of \\"Exit Music(For A Film)\\" (the latter has brilliant background noises), every song reeks of genius. And it's not focused on any one individual either. Phil Selway (drums) excels, especially on the afore-mentioned 'Paranoid Android', and Colin Greenwood (bass) lays down some intriging basslines (his moment of glory arrives on the hypnotic 'Karma Police'). Jonny Greenwood (guitar) will probably go down as one of the most inventive guitarists of the decade, as he uses his impressive arsenal of effects to good effect. ...<BR>                Overall, a must buy, from a great band who never fails to deliver.
B00006690G|5.0|I am a tried and true country fan, and yet there is something about Eminem that catches me.  The beat to his songs are good, and the lyrics make you laugh.  For those who think he does nothing but complain about his life, if you really listen, he is making jokes about life in general most of the time.  And I like the fact that he can use the same number of words per verse, or make it all rhyme.  That shows real talent; it's like writing a poem and putting it to music.  I have liked all of Eminem's previous albums, and this one is the best so far.  I think you have to have an open mind and be able to take his songs as entertainment, not philosophy, to enjoy Eminem. (And if you have a problem with the language, don't buy an album marked explicict lyrics!)

B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis #1. 46 years after his first #1 Billboard Album he rules the charts again from the grave. The controversy about Elvis stealing from the style of Negroes is as strong now as it was nearly 50 years before. In the end, the only thing one can conclude is that he just did it better. Have you ever heard the Big Mama Thornton version of Hounnd Dog? How could he have stolen Jackie Wilson's style, when he didn't have his first hit, Reet Petite, until 1958 while Elvis was in the Army and already the King of the whole wide world? Maybe it was jackie that did the borrowing . . .  Elvis was a musical inovator that was influenced by White and Black Baptist Gospel music and his stage antics were those of the wild revival ministers he had watched growing up. He enjoyed Hillbilly-Race-Pop and Mario Lanza and brought it all together with his own distinct sound and style unlike anyone's. Little Richard's music only Rolled, it never Rocked and he just played a jumped up version of Ragtime called Tin Pan Alley or Honkey Tonk. Listen to the Sun Sessions and hear the birth of Rockabilly and Rock &amp; Roll on one album. It is the Rosetta Stone of Rock &amp; Roll and documents the coming of the artist of the century. To this day, there is everyone else and then there's Elvis-Elvis-Elvis.
0790729628|3.0|Blade runner has always been one of, if not my favorite SF films.I waited for the DVD and was disapointed with the \\"directors cut\\". I agree with other reviewers, that I would buy the original on DVD in a second.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers: An unbelievable event, made for TV. Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, this series, based on true occurrences, has all the realism and gut wrenching tension that we saw in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".<br /><br />I had no idea of what was in store for me when I dropped the first disc in the DVD player. I was simply mesmerized: I could have sat through the entire series non-stop except for the fact the five movie discs plus one specialty disc took up about 12 hours. I could hardly wait for the next day to arrive to watch the next segment.<br /><br />The series is about a group of men that volunteer for the newly formed parachute regiment and eventually drop in behind enemy lines in Normandy, France on D-day, June 6, 1944. They eventually end up capturing Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in Austria as WWll ends.<br /><br />When I saw \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" I didn't think that any war movie could be better: I was wrong. Band of Brothers is well acted, incredible realistic and shows you what a prolonged campaign must have been like with the constant stress and tension that turned boys into men and men into.....<br /><br />As this series develops, from one story to the next, you begin to appreciate the meaning of the cliche \\" the fog of war\\": sometimes simple sorties turn into unexpected nightmares and then other times when all seem lost, something or someone, completely unexpected, will turn up and save the day. You just can never predict in war what will happen: who will turn in a hero or a man paralyzed with fear or fatigue. Nothing is ever a 100% sure bet.<br /><br />Adding to the drama of the story are the interviews with the actual participants who lived through this horrific period and are still alive today. You can still see the agony in some of their faces when they recall old events and missing friends that didn't return home with them. Unbelievably touching!<br /><br />All in all an incredible series: something everyone should see just to make you realize what these men (and women) went through for us. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.ize what these men (and women) went through for us. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.
B00005J4HH|4.0|Muse are a fairly original band, contrary to popular belief.  Sure, the singing is similar to Thom Yorke's (of Radiohead) but so do a lot of other bands, namely Coldplay.  Basically, Muse combines techno elements with piercing, over-the-top vocals to create a very ear-pleasing album.  Unfortunately, the songs don't vary much in style, so the album can be difficult to hear all in one sitting.  It's better listening to individual songs.<br />New Born--This is probably the most catchy, instantly accessible song on the album.  It starts out slow with some nice piano and builds up to something quite powerful.  8.5/10<br />Bliss--Similar to New Born, but not quite as good.  I don't like the chorus enough for it to be one of my favorites.  Still a fairly good song.  8/10<br />Space Dementia--One of the best songs on the album.  From the nice introduction to the intense vocals, this song is great.  The piano really works well here.  9/10<br />Hyper Music--This is a decent song.  Again, nothing spectacular, but it's catchy and fairly original.  8/10<br />Plug-In Baby--This is a really good song.  It'll grab you right from the beginning, and the chorus is very melodic and catchy.  Certainly one of the better songs on the album.  8.5/10<br />Citizen Erased--Probably my favorite song on the album.  I like how it starts out hard, then goes soft and then hard again.  The synth line throughout is very cool-sounding, and the vocals are dramatic.  9.2/10<br />Micro Cuts--The vocals are extremely high-pitched here, sounding like a rock-opera.  It's a bit cheesy, but it all works out in the end to create a loud, vivid song.  8.3/10<br />Screenager--This song is alright.  Unlike most of the other songs on the album, it's calm and doesn't have a chorus or climax that makes you want to keep listening.  Probably my least favorite song on this cd.  7/10<br />Darkshines--Similar to all the other songs, both in quality and style.  There's nothing very unique here, but it's still a good song.8.5/10<br />Feeling Good--This is a cover song Muse did.  It's obviously the one which stands out as a different style from the rest, in a good way.  Though cover songs generally turn out fairly mediocre, they did a good job with this one, particularly with the synths during the chorus.  8.3/10<br />Futurism--This is an interesting song with a distinct industrial sound to it.  Deserves special recognition because it doesn't follow the same style as most of the other songs on the album.  8.5/10<br />Megalomania--Not a great song.  It's pretty good, but tends to get a bit boring in parts, and isn't as well made as most of the songs here.  7.5/10
B000001FOL|4.0|Unlike one of the other reviewers I'm not bothered that music from this album was used on the popular Royal Tennenbaums soundtrack. It drove me completely crazy, though, when part of &quot;These Days&quot; was used on a K-Mart commercial this past winter. I will never go near a K-Mart again.<br />I like Nico's voice. It's a huge, sweeping, germanic thing -- it doesn't move gently. If you want range/nuance go for Joni Mitchell's early stuff instead: Nico doesn't possess those things.<br /> What I love the most about Chelsea Girls is the captivating combination of Nico's voice with the songwriting and guitar work of Jackson Browne. &quot;Please don't confront me with my failures,&quot; she sings on These Days, &quot;I have not forgotten them.&quot; These Days has a more formal version of the smooth laid-back full sound that appears on Browne's first album, Saturate Before Using, released a few years later. The strings on the album fit properly -- it sounds like a folk record, not a gloppy mess -- thanks to Tom Wilson's production work. This kind of songwriting and styling doesn't exist at all on her later records, and most big Nico fans prefer her experimental stuff and don't have a problem with this. Not me, though. &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; stands out for me because the songs are organized, acoustic, frightening and moody without being morbid and droning.<br />Best tracks: &quot;These Days&quot; featuring Browne's circling guitar line. &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons&quot; is ornate folk. &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; ('Margaret's all wrapped up in foil, she wonders if / she can uncoil'). &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot; is a good Lou Reed song in the same vein as her Velvet Underground stuff. &quot;Eulogy to Lenny Bruce&quot; is sparse and almost melodramatic; it works as a closer.  <br />Less impressive tracks: &quot;It was a Pleasure Then&quot; is more characteristic of her later work and folkies like me will be hitting the skip button there. Her Dylan tune,&quot;I'll Keep it With Mine&quot;, seems to be included to adhere to the 60s one-Dylan-per-album standard; it's really unremarkable. And her vocal on &quot;Somewhere There's a Feather&quot; is off, but the song is classic Jackson Browne ('Someday there will be another lover till the end - you need not hold your breath till then'.)<br />Recommended to fans of the Velvet Undergound &amp; Nico, Nick Drake, and Jackson Bowne's first album.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I've listened to the good and  bad about Star Trek movies for many years, and I've been a fan for many more.  Everyone said it was an even movie and thus had to be good... Well, it didn't disappoint me one bit.  The movie had a good mix of the humor from Insurrection, the darkness from II and VI and all the battle scenes we've come to expect as Star Trek fans.  This movie most likely will not win over any new fans, and for those who don't know a lot about the Star Trek universe, some things may seem strange and not logical.  Well, the movie isn't dealing with Vulcans, and logic isn't a strong point of the Romulans.  This movie does try to make you think about humanity, society, and what is inane, but it doesn't provide a completly fulfilling answer.  Take this movie more on an action basis, don't think too much, have fun with the amazing battle scenes, enjoy the interaction between the characters, cry when so-and-so dies, and enjoy the trip back into the Star Trek universe.  Hope you enjoy.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age's new album Songs for the Deaf is perhaps the best album of 2002.  It's loaded with good tracks from start to finish.  The DJ bits get a little redundant, but they are there for a purpose.  The truly interesting thing is how well the album is put together.  It is rarely the case that one would have to listen to the album from start to finish to really get a feel for how good an album it is.  All the songs flow into one and other.  For example, their first single, &quot;No One Knows&quot; is a good song in it's own right.  It has made a handful of fans with it's radio play, as well as a bunch of people who don't like the song.  But when put in the context of the album the other songs make it better, and it makes the other songs better.  I truly think that all fans of rock music should purchase this album.  Not only will you enjoy it more and more every time you listen to it, but it can fit perfectly into any rock music collection and be a complete standout all at the same time.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|First, I adore Hugh Grant.  As soon as i saw the preview I wanted to view this film.  It was simply wonderful.  It's a charming tale of Will, a rich, unemployed singleton who lives off royalties from a song his father wrote.  It takes a young boy to teach him to face the realties of life and that gaining complications helps us grow and expand as individuals. Since viewing the film I read 2 of Nick Hornby's novels, including this one, they are great as well.  The novel matched the film almost to a tee, which made for great reading...I laughed out loud many times!! You will enjoy his candor and yet humourous childishness at the same time.  I am definitely now a fan.
B0000041JU|5.0|This is one heck of an album! Sure, IVO plays with the tempos alot, but his pianism is of a highly adventurous caliber, and his interpretations are never careless.<br />Also, the sound on this disc is more than adequate; actually one of the best recorded pianos I've heard on disc. I have no idea why the sound receives any negative marks here.<br />I don't think Ivo Pogorelich is interested in paying homage to anyone; not composer nor pianists past. But his approach does have the adventurous spirit of someone like Glenn Gould; if you can tolerate the guy, this makes for one exciting musical experience. Yes, it sounds like he is playing to please himself, rather than to placate an aesthetic or snooty audience. But I admire his chutzpah.
B000053ZRR|5.0|You won't be sorry buying this masterpiece! This video has everthing to keep your foot thumping! First hand advice! Any person having a vehicle with a video intertainment unit (DVD) this video Cranks!
B00007E8V4|5.0|i think this cd is their best cd! the reasons for this are 1. chic n stew! you gotta love it! i've had a live version of it for a while and i was waiting for them to do a studio version since then it's an awesome song! that made the whole cd when i heard it this has to be the best cd, of course in my opinion system of a down's first cd is much better than toxicity also, it's less popish and this cd definately goes back to their heavy side...i had both innervision and f the system before also but it's good to have them on one cd! i'm thoroughly happy with this album and it's gotta be one of the best in my collections...of course there are a couple of slow songs, but they are as good as spiders from their first album and i'm sure any original system of a down fan would consider this one of their best...
B00005JLRR|5.0|Yes, that is right.  This film ranks with the best and may even surpass.  I was completely entertained the entire time.  This film shows how good Star Trek can be.  Too many of the films and episodes for that matter do not have enough Star in the Trek.<br />I don't think that the cast or the ship itself have ever looked better. We also get a villian that ranks right below Kahn in substance.  <br />Without giving up the plot I can say that there is a great twist involving Picard and the Remen leader who now rules the Romulan Empire.  <br />The battle scenes in space are the best I've seen in Star Trek.  The ship can finally take more than one or two shots but not too many to be unbelievable.  The manouvering and tactics in the scene have not been seen since Wrath of Kahn.<br />The film also ends with an unexpected loss.<br />I loved this film and highly recommend it!
B000066NW0|4.0|It's hard to talk about Avril without evoking a debate on the subject of whether she is &quot;a punk or a poser&quot;, but that's completely beside the point.  As some reviewer seem to overlook, we're talking about her music, not her image.<br />I think this is a good CD.  I'm pleasantly surprised at the range she shows -- the contrast between Sk8ter Boi and I'm With You, for example.  Her voice is really her best asset; she has a good range that doesn't thin out at the top.  Her live performances are a little uneven but she's still very young vocally and I expect that will change.<br />Lyrically, many of the songs are uneven and on the immature side but they also show real promise.  I especially like I'm With You and Tomorrow, which are evenly paced and thoughtful and certainly not punk.  Many of the lyrics flow smoothly, but at other times they reveal someone trying to hard to find a rhyme.<br />Avril is quite young still but I'm hopeful that her next album will build on this one.  The big question is which direction her music will go in, given the exploratory style of Let Go.<br />Overall, this is certainly worth a listen and I'm enjoying it.
0316666343|5.0|This book is written on a highly interesting and intellectual level, exploring the dimensions of both the living and the dead. The fact that makes this book superior to others of its genre is that it is written from a unique perspective, that of a dead girl in her version of heaven, viewing the lives of all those who were important and remain so, while she was living.
B000000OAC|5.0|I know alot of people will argue, but Queen was the best. I have listened to heavy and hard rock for years. I know and love all the great bands. When you look at who was big in hard rock in '77, Nugent, KISS, Foreigner, etc, you see what I mean. Think, do you know any bands as musically intelligent and heavy at the same time? Led Zeppelin was just sheer power and force. Queen had the power, and the brains. This record was the best heavy metal record of the year. My friends and I all wore this record out. Punk tried to take over, and classic hard rock kicked it's behind(until grunge came along). Queen was one of the bands the punk groups mocked. Well, go listen to the Sex Pistols or the Ramones, then listen to Queen. You tell me whats better.
B00003ZA27|2.0|Overly pompous and majestic, this recording of the B minor mass doesnt come anywhere close to the other two Ive listened a lot to recently: Marriner on Philips and Gardiner on Archiv. (Both highly recommended.) Karajans reindition lacks clarity and pace, and -- which is worse -- a true understanding of the works religious nature. It just becomes another showpiece for a prolific conductor with his all-star soloists, and the end result is bland, uninteresting and, above all, fails to stir up any deeper emotions whatsoever.
B000002P2V|2.0|Who are you was a large disaapointment as The Who's last real album. It was Keith Moon's last and being a huge fan, I expected it to be one of their best. This album aspires to be a punk album with intentions to change the music industry. Instead, all it accomplishes is proving the point, &quot;People don't know when to quit&quot;. The title track &quot;Who Are You&quot; is great however all the other songs are monotonous and boring. The difference between this and Quadrophenia was the energy level. Who Are You lacks a sparkle that most of the Who albums had. Quadrophenia always left you with energy and adrenaline. Who Are You tries to accomplish this but unfortunately fails to the task. Who's Next always had the Pete Townsend shine in the background with &quot;Baba O'Reily&quot;. If you are looking for a Who album and aren't familiar with this band. This is not the album to start with. If you want an album and you are just starting out, stick to Who's Next. You'll get more out of it. <BR>Overall, The Who, no matter how much they tried to shed their late sixties image of &quot;My Generation,&quot; they failed. Therefore, I give them two stars for the song Who Are You. This album could be much better.
B000001F3C|5.0|I'll admit, I wasn't really into U2 until this year. War was one of the first U2 albums that I bought.It's very political which is what I like about it. &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; is a very powerful song. When you listen to the song(and all U2 songs)you really get a clear picture of what's going on. &quot;Seconds&quot; is a herald of what might happen when 2 superpowers take things too far.Apocalyptic,but very good. &quot;New Year's Day&quot; is very energetic and the guitar work and vocals are amazing. &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot; is another classic and one of my favorite songs. &quot;Surrender&quot; is a clever song and another one that I love.&quot;40&quot; is a beautiful song. FYI-It was taken from Psalm 40. It's about fighting but gives a hopeful message for peace at the end. &quot;War&quot; is a powerful kinda angsty CD,but it's a great listen.
B0000542D2|3.0|This was the first DVD title I bought, and I was disappointed by the sound quality.  There is hardly any surround sound at all; For the most of the movie, only the center channel is used, and the dialog sounds quite muddy.  When there is a musical selection, the front L&amp;R speakers kick in nicely, but the volume is much louder.  Once the song is done, the volume returns to a lower level, and only the center channel is heard once again.  The only time I heard my rear speakers was during the concert scene at the end of the film.  If you buy this DVD expecting true 5.1 surround, you will be disappointed.  But, the film itself is still a classic.
B00003CXI1|3.0|This movie is perfect for most Harry Potter fans, who were delightled to see their visions of Hogwarts and the Magical World come to life on the big screen.  However, for me, this movie was more of an exercise in frustration than anything else, as I beleive the adaption from the  book is not as faithful as it could be (see Lord of the Rings for an incredibly faithful book-to-movie transition.)

B00006LPER|3.0|Isabelle Huppert is an amazing actress. Her rendering of persona in this film is quite remarkable. It only goes downhill after that. Though I would cautiously recommend this film to Huppert fans and Francophiles de Cinema.<br />The film deals in a prismatic way (not straightforward) with issues of self-abuse, incest, self-loathing, sexual deviance, rage, seduction and oddly enough, love.<br />Many questions are left unanswered, hence you must be the psychiatrist and discover the mysterious pathology behind all these behaviours (and you should know that they are not at all clear). If you like the type of film where you have to delve deep into the psychological trauma and gestalt of a character, then this film will leave you thinking and discussing and wondering for hours. Perhaps you will arrive at a diagnosis and many of the questions unanswered will find formulation. <br />Perhaps at that point the wonderful sets and beautiful acting will not have been for naught, that beneath the pain and excruciating scenes of deviance and humiliation will reveal something deeper about the human condition and our common existence. If you arrive at such a conclusion would you please write me and enlighten me as to this film's deeper meanings.<br />Also, it should be noted that this film is extremely explicit.<BR>Not for kids under any circumstances.

B000002UCN|4.0|When I heard about this album, I actually expected all the songs to be from his post-Beatles career. While this album has many great and fabulous songs, it's also missing others. Songs from \\"Cloud Nine\\" and \\"Brainwashed\\" are missing, so you can call this album completed if it were 1976 again. Other than that, this is still a great compilation of George Harrison's best songs, and I recommend it to anyone interested in his music.
B00005JLRR|1.0|I thought the trailer looked good but unfortunately, our faith in John Logan (Gladiator) was misplaced. I feel sorry for the cast of this film in that they all look so very very tired and worn. It's been three years since the last film yet they look as if they've aged six. I was really hoping that this would be a nice solid film but it's the Next Gen cast trying to be the old cast and it doesn't work, it's boring and it may rank as one of the worst. The previous film, insurrection may ultimately have more going for it this was so ....lame. Time for the film franchise to either get the DS9 team taking over or just call it quits. -Rick Lundeen
B00006690G|5.0|oh my gosh. this cd is totally dope. it's awesome, superman, business, cleaning out my closet. they're all so great and i just love this cd. also, i must add that eminem is the greatest artist of all time, and that if there's a perfect cd in the world, this is it. please buy it. everyone, whether eminem's your idol or you hate his guts(which i hope no one does) you should still buy this awesome cd.
B00005Q45W|5.0|This album is a must for Leonard lovers or anyone who wants a listening experience so deep that it cuts to the bone. The lyrics are so good and deeply distilled that they move you into a place of deep reflection. It isn't jolly by any means, but each song builds on the previous song to create a very particular way of looking at living, loving, leaving and death. It is sinewy and seductive. My favorite album this year.
B00006CYAD|4.0|I love this cd. It is great. I like to blast it and sing loud. Teens can relate to the lyrics. For the girls, these guys are hotties. I saw them live in concert and they rocked! My favorite song is 'One SlowDance' It's not on the album
0553573403|5.0|This book is incredible, it will sink it's teeth into you and won't let go.  The characters are so well written and memorable that despite the HUGE number of characters large and small you will remember each and every one like an old friend.  Martin also includes a in depth appendix in case you forget. =)<br />I read fantasy for the character interactions and politics, my husband reads fantasy for the action and adventure.  This is one novel we could both agree was EXCELLENT!<br />Highly recommended to all adult fantasy fans.
0060977493|5.0|Just read this book. The novel that defies time and structure.
B00005JLRR|4.0|When I first saw the theatrical trailer for this film, it surprised me greatly; It looked like the \\"Star Trek\\" equivalent of \\"Attack of the Clones\\", only with better-looking performances.  However, when I saw the movie (on opening day because I'm a geek..heh), I was a little startled to find that the action that is shown in the commercials and trailers are actually the only action scenes in the film.  This time around, Captain Picard and his gallant crew stand around and talk a lot.<br />Now, had I known this before I saw the movie, I would not have been so disappointed on opening day, hoping for the Next Generation crew to transport me into a world of intrigue and non-stop excitement.  Instead, we are actually presented with a richer storyline, and some surprisingly strong performances, most notably from Tom Hardy as the evil Shinzon (I think I spelled his name right).  This time around, we are actually presented with multi-dimentional characters as opposed to the rather 2-D, rather boring villains of the previous movie.<br />Now that what I saw has really had time to sink-into my psyche, I can honestly say that \\"Nemesis\\" is really one of the better, if not one of the best \\"Star Trek\\" movies you'll see.  However, this movie does seem to be a bit odd at times, mostly with the editing and pacing of the film.  Even with its grander scale, the movie still races along like a television episode, and the characters seem to be trying to shove as much info and dialogue into a small amount of time, almost as if they're anticipating a commercial break.  This movie is cut to move fast, which seems to work against it, rather than for it.  Longer pauses, stronger beats -- these are what separate film from television, and the filmmakers seemed to be unaware of this...but that's just me ranting as a film student in college, pretending I know what I'm talking about.<br />All in all, this movie really seems to be a success, finally portraying progress in the lives of the Next Generation crew.  This succeeds in elevating the film to a new level.  It's just a shame that it won't make any money, what with the second Lord of the Rings film being released a week later.  Gee.  Smart move Paramount.  So, go see the movie and hopefully you will be captivated by the Next Generation crew finally being the explorers and adventurers they were long, long ago.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This woman is a goddess, in her art, in her physical self, in her Prada clothes. I have all of her CD's and adore each one, but to hear her live is something else. There is a demension not present in her studio recordings, not better not worse, simply another facet to this talented woman. Live she is more energetic, more daring, more virtuosic. In the studio she is more intimate, more controlled. The only thing better than hearing the Paris CD would be to have heard the concert in person. Her performance of the rare gem &quot;A Case of You&quot; is priceless! I only regret that I must share her with so many countless others!
0393307050|5.0|This series of books are all one could hope for.  They provide an accurate in-depth, well written description of the world during Napoleons quest for dominance.  They were a bit difficult for me to get into due to the unfamiliar language. Once I became familiar with the characters I was constantly reading, devouring book after book.  Not only do these books offer a glimpse of the past, they describe the trials and tribulations which we face today in one form or another.  Charactar development is superlative as is the storyline.
B00007BH5C|5.0|If \\"Fellowship\\" was the appetizer, \\"Two Towers\\" is the main course.<br />The first track of \\"Two Towers\\" begins as \\"Fellowship\\" did, returning us to Middle-Earth with the foreboding strings that opened the first film.  Then come the drums, and you know instantly that this part of the saga is different: now the stakes are high, and the urgency great.  Time is running out.  Chanting erupts in the same theme from Fellowship of the Ring's \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\" but then transforms into new melodies, and suddenly ceases as if halted in the middle.<br />In \\"The Taming of Smeagol\\" we are reintroduced to the Hobbits with their theme, but don't get too comfortable: just when you think you know the territory, you are shaken from your complacency.  Something entirely new emerges, and it is the most noble and glorious theme yet in the series: \\"The Riders of Rohan.\\"  This is our first encounter with the race of Men, and the music beautifully conveys their bravery, courage, and determination.  In this track Shore employs the Norweigan fiddle, called the hardinger, to invoke images of the Vikings.<br />Now we take a glance at the Hobbits in \\"The Passage of the Marshes,\\" and we are in dark territory indeed.  But fear not, because from there our gaze lights upon Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as they rush to rescue Merry and Pippin in \\"The Uruk-hai.\\"  This track makes most use of themes from \\"Fellowship\\" as you will recognize the triumphant Fellowship theme and the percussive, brassy tones of the Uruk-hai.  <br />Shore quickly returns to his new material and elaborates on the Rohan theme in \\"The King of the Golden Hall,\\" and though halfway in the track things get a bit shady, it concludes with a renewed--though more somber--heroism.  \\"The Black Gate is Closed\\" conjures up exactly what the title implies: frustration and imminent failure; before your heart can break, though, the gorgeous \\"Evenstar\\" featuring the ethereal vocals of Isabel Bayrakdarian floats out to comfort you.  <br />But what's this?  Something approaches, and it is \\"The White Rider.\\"  Here Howard Shore takes my breath away, as arpeggiated harp and soft voices build into a full orchestra calling us back to the Quest.  Onward!<br />Though \\"Treebeard\\" opens seriously, it turns eerily playful as wooden percussions give a forest effect.  The woods are usually home to Elves, too, and they make their presence known in \\"The Leave Taking\\" with the \\"Rivendell\\" theme of the first movie.<BR>  <BR>With all the leave-taking done, everything is in place for the battle of battles: \\"Helm's Deep.\\"  I commend Howard Shore--and probably Peter Jackson as well, as the two collaborated heavily about the film's music--for the way this event was handled musically.  Rather than being a loud and boisterous war party, the music instead portrays the sad but steadfast courage of a vastly outnumbered army making their last stand to defend their civilization.  It is one of the most touching moments in the score.<br />\\"The Forbidden Pool\\" is five-and-a-half minutes of low, ominous notes ending with singing by the boy's choir, and the mystical \\"Breath of Life\\" concludes with a rhythmic, almost \\"Conan\\"-like march.  Towards the end of \\"The Hornburg\\" we are treated to another new dark, brassy theme with an Arabian feel to it--and though it is oddly reminiscent of \\"The Godfather,\\" it is enjoyable nonetheless.<br />Now we are winding towards the end of the movie, and the music takes off to soar to its exciting conclusion with \\"Forth Earlingas.\\" As we fly off, however, we look anxiously over our shoulder and see \\"Isengard Unleashed.\\"  The troubles are only now coming to their head, and there is a long, bitter fight yet ahead.  In spite of this impending doom, we turn one final look upon \\"Samwise the Brave,\\" and are softly reminded of Galadriel's words in the first film: \\"Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.\\"<br />Overall \\"The Two Towers\\" soundtrack has immediately become one of my favorites and worthy of all five stars.  If the movie is as good as Howard Shore's music, we should be in for one amazing experience!<br />P.S. On a technical note, the recording is crystal clear and the London Philharmonic sounds gorgeous.  And what about the final track, \\"Gollum's Song\\"?  You can download it from Amazon.com and see for yourself!

B00006J9OT|3.0|I GENERALLY DO NOT LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES,, IT SEEMS TO TAKE AWAY THE REAL SOUNDS..
B00003CX9W|5.0|One of the few good things about &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; is that after I saw it, it compelled me to dig out the original Fantasia and watch it again. I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.<br />Of coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot; which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's &quot;Pastoral symphony&quot; which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have &quot;The Dance of the Hours&quot; Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night. This is shown through some very beautiful animation. Sense I was only 8 when I saw this the first time, I was mainly focusing on the cartoon part of it, and the quality of animation made me think it was a new release, and not a 50 year old classic.<br/>Forget Fantasia 2000. This movie is the real deal.

B00006V9A0|2.0|If you already have Nirvana's previous albums, then I would strongly recommend that you pass on this. 'You Know You're Right' is a great song that surely would have been a hit when it was first recorded, and would have fit nicely on 'In Utero'. Unfortunately, I would not recommend buying this based on this alone. You will hear it enough on the radio in the next few months to get your fill of it. The acoutic version of All Apologies maybe 'new' for some, but let's not forget what is really going on here: an obvious, blatent money grab by Courtney Love. Kurt would have had nothing to do with this project!! This goes against everything he stood for!! Any true Nirvana fans would agree, I'm sure. Makes me sad, actually. 'YKYR' should have been released as a single only, not on a 'greatest hits' album just before xmas. Saddening. All true Nirvana fans should boycott this album so as to not support Kurt's talentless, greedy, heartless wife any longer. Hasn't she taken enough already?? This only goes to further show that she never really understood her husband. Shame, Courtney, shame... Justice For Kurt!!
B00007E8V4|4.0|Whereas Toxicity marked a branching out of sorts, as far as different tempos and influences, \\"Steal this Album\\" is pure heaviness and speed, and sometimes seems a showcase for Serj's yodeller on ... vocal routines. Much closer to their debut than Toxicity in style, the songs are good enough for STA to beat the B-side rep and merit it's own release.<br />Chic'N'Stu has ridiculously funny lyrics ala \\"Bounce\\" from Toxicity, and is also nice and fast. My fav songs are the schitzophrenic \\"F the System\\", \\"Highway Song\\", and the excellent Streamline
B000067JD3|4.0|I went to see this movie initially because of Michael Douglas, but it turned out to be his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones that stuck out as a pregnant drug lord's wife, who'll do anything to get her husband out of jail.  I instantly became a czj fan, and watched some other stuff of hers.  Now I can really appreciate just how good an actress she is.  She can play a farm girl, spy, action heroine, gypsy, villain, queen...and always pull it off.  Not to mention in any time period.  This was really the role of a lifetime for her; it's too bad Oscar snubbed her.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The DVD edition is nice for those who like Superman. Although I only purchased Superman I &amp; II- they were the best, it is nice collector item. You have to turn over the DVD to get the special features which is the down side. However, it is a great movie, and as I said before if you Clark Kent- then buy it. I really can't say anymore about this movie.

B00007E8O5|5.0|As a somewhat grouchy Alice in Chains/Soundgarden fan from back in the early '90's, I've become pretty upset at the direction that the rock scene has taken since the original \\"grunge\\" bands passed from prominence.  In fact, I'd rather slam my hand in a car door than listen to Nickelback or Puddle of Mudd's dumbed-down excuse for hard rock.  So when former Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell released \\"Degradation Trip\\" earlier this year, I was all over it.  And now that it's been rereleased in two-disc format, with eleven more songs than the original version, it's like a gift from above for an old (23) guy like me.  That said, this album is enjoyable for WAY more than nostalgic value.  It rules in its own right.<br />Since Jerry was largely responsible for Alice in Chains's sound, it's no suprise that his solo band (is that an oxymoron?) retains some elements of his old band.  \\"Degradation Trip\\" loses little of the dark atmosphere that made albums like \\"Dirt\\" such classics.  Jerry is an excellent and creative guitarist, and his signature sound, with its heavy, distorted riffing, is still evident on songs like \\"Spiderbite\\" and \\"Pro False Idol.\\"  As a vocalist, Jerry can't match late Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley's range or power, but I think it would be pretty unreasonable to expect him to.  His voice is still plenty powerful and emotional, and his delivery eerily resembles Layne's.  Jerry also gets excellent support from Ozzy Osbourne's rhythm section of bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin.  Robert's thumping basslines and Mike's muscular, nuanced drumming give Jerry plenty of space to explore with his guitar, and that's pretty important.<br />Alice in Chains's sound, with Jerry's distorted guitar work and Layne's tortured vocals, was always closer to metal than to grunge.  This album is no exception, even if it isn't guite as heavy as, say, \\"Dirt.\\"  Rather, Jerry goes for a more eclectic approach here, expanding on his former band's thinking-man's metal approach.  There are still plenty of the dark, sludgy dirges Alice in Chains were known for, the opening \\"Psychotic Break\\" being a prime example.  However, there are also great acoustic-based tunes like the depressing \\"Solitude\\" and the more upbeat \\"Angel Eyes.\\"  And as the single \\"Anger Rising\\" and \\"Locked On\\" prove, Jerry can still rock out with the best of them.  There's even a great, moving ballad on here, namely \\"Gone.\\"  When Jerry sings \\"Now You're Gone, Gone Away\\" at the end of the song, it's pretty hard not to think of Layne, or of anyone close to you that you've ever lost.<br />On the whole, as I think this review has made clear, I can't say enough good things about this album.  Jerry Cantrell just does an amazing job of building on Alice in Chains's signature sound without pillaging it.  At twenty-five songs covering more than two hours, \\"Degradation Trip\\" never sounds boring or forced.  It just sounds good.  If you love Alice in Chains, or even good rock music in general, as much as I do, then this album is a must.king-man's metal approach.

B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix, by far, is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The special effects were great, the story was easy to follow, and the acting was great.  Although I'm not a huge Reeves fan, he was perfect for the role of Neo.  Great film.
B00006G8G4|5.0|I've been a big Spider-Man fan since childhood. I've been waiting for this release for YEARS. It was worth the wait. The Collector's Set is a little expensive, but everyone should see Spider-Man. The casting is excellent, and Raimi stayed true to the comic book for the most part. It really is excellent.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Although most thought this movie lacked action and contained annoying accents, I found this to be a very entertaining and well written movie.  The plot was great.  Tunnel diggers waken a beast, in this case a dragon, which scorches the world and spawns millions of these creatures.  The action sequences are awesome and the movie is all together great.

1573228737|5.0|\\"Confidence\\" is the operative watchword of Sarah Waters's splendid second novel set in the Victorian period: it is told through the confidences told in the diaries of two women, one a wealthy single woman who is visiting prisoners in a London pentitentiary, and the other a medium who has been arrested for fraud. As the novel continues, Margaret Prior slowly comes to gain confidence in the medium, Selina Dawes, especially when she herself is visited by ghostly manifestations. It is almost impossible to put the novel down: it gains your own confiedence as you go along, and you come to care desperately about the characters. But this (like Waters's next novel FINGERSMITH) is the rare pageturner that also builds a complex web of allusion and metaphor as it proceeds.
0684803356|4.0|Perhaps the bell tolled for Ernest and his bid for literary greatness with the passing of this book.  Did Hemingway exhaust all his courage, strength, and virility in this work?<br />FWTBT is leagues away from The Sun Also Rises, taking themes from A Farewell to Arms to another level.  To the extent that Hemingway wanted to reach the apex of truth in storytelling, and to find a suitable language to express it, this book is a great achievement.  Hemingway chooses Spanish modulation of English words to power his narrative - from the start, the reader senses the honor, strength, and spirit every sentence spoken carries with it.  <br />Ernest is not just translating from Spanish to wow us; the reader feels that when he wrote this book, Spanish was the only language that could express his happiness, his sadness, his pleasure and suffering.  Maybe Spanish contained the words and meanings Hemingway and those involved in the war for Spanish liberty sought desperately every night by the campfire - words of fear and love.<br />To me, this book was Hemingway's most significant attempt at articulating his life philosophy.  It is ominous in the hero's struggles with his personal and family history - of duty, resignation and death, inability to hope or believe, or believe that happiness can last.  You might argue that El Sordo's last stand is followed by Hemingway's personal literary last stand - against fascism, fear, and life's various illusions.  This is Hemingway's last battle.  Thereafter, he is honorably discharged to a life of fishing and beautiful memoirs.
B00005JLRR|4.0|It's good, go check it out. It hold's true to the TNG (The Next Generation) formula. An Evil force of some form takes on the Federation, and our \\"Enterprising\\" heroes move in to stop them! Accompanying the main plot is a sub-plot, usually less exciting, and mostly dedicated to character building. Nemesis fills in the blanks very well. <BR>     There is enough new Star Trek technologies, character drama, and battles to satisfy your average USA human. But this may not be a good thing. Some trekkies want to see the old Star Trek formula tilt on its axis. Perhaps a story about the Dominion wars, or even the Cardassian conflict; with blood, battle and heroism. This should replentish software trekkies with new technologies and FX. Certainly filling in some of those wide open spaces in the Star Trek time line might satisfy some folks.<BR>     Nemesis is worth your money. But I only gave the film 4 stars. Why? Well, If you ask a software trekkie, Hollywood really has to work hard to make the shows and films with cutting edge special effects. It must be visually spectatular to \\"stay par\\" with todays' home PC game graphics and mods.<BR>     It was good to see more Romulans, and the Remans, a horrid caste of the Romulan Empire. Nemesis rates somewhere towards \\"First Contact\\" with respect to the other TNG movies.
0070511136|5.0|A breath of fresh air.  The profession of Sales is plagued with all sorts of nonsense, most of it annecdotal at best.  Little actual research has been done to identify good processes for sales professionals and consequently we get idiotic advice ranging from \\"Always Be Closing\\" and endless manipulative closing techniques for doing so, to recommendations on how to sell \\"anything to anybody.\\"  Such sales tactics are precisely the reason salespeople have been saddled with negative stereotypes.<br />SPIN Selling is the result of extensive observation and analysis of sales calls by behavioral researcher Neil Rackham.  His findings are both practical and useful, and are well presented in this book.  As sellers, we might give some thought to how we would like to be treated as customers - something that should not be a revelation, but is.  We should understand the customer's goals and objectives and help them be successful if we want to be successful.  Forget your scripted sales pitch, leave your brochures in your briefcase, ask questions and listen to your customers to understand their needs BEFORE presenting your product.  Surprisingly, this will actually shorten the selling cycle and will result in better long-term customer relationships.  Rackham's concept of an \\"Advance\\" as an objective way to measure the progress of a sales call is, alone, worth the price of this book.<br />As a sales professional with many years' experience, and now as sales training manager for a division of a Fortune 500 company, I highly recommend this book and the methodology Rackham describes.  There are other good books for salespeople - but if I could only recommend one, this would be it.
B00000DHR0|5.0|You will not find a better Christmas album in your lifetime than &quot;These Are Special Times.&quot; It's just not possible. Celine takes a classic song like &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and makes it her own. You may have heard the song a hundred times before but when you hear Celine sing it you'll say to yourself &quot;Oh THAT's how it's supposed to sound!&quot; Celine's voice and Christmas music is the perfect match. &quot;The Magic of Christmas Day&quot; and &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; are sure to become classics and be played 50 years from now. The thing I love about Celine's Christmas album is that she doesn't ruin ANY of the classic songs by adding notes where they're not supposed to be like Mariah or Christina does. She sings all the songs straight and the way they were meant to sound. The only thing I HATE about this album is that it's too short. There should be at least 30 more songs on this album because once you start listening you don't want to stop. The only other Christmas albums that are worthy to play along with this one is Barbra Streisand's, Bryan White's, Jewel's, and Elvis's.
0676973779|5.0|Never would I have thought that the story of just a boy and a tiger lost out at sea, could touch on so many things in life, love,loss,family,religion,belief, faith. Martel writes a story that simply does not linger, yet jump from one page to the next. Told in three parts with a true sense of where it's going, Life of Pi is amazingly believeable, and told in such a way that you most likely have never read before. No book or movie that I have read/viewed has come this close to telling the ultimate story of self, and the things we cling to for comfort, hope, and fear.
B00005JLRR|4.0|One of the more signifigant things I liked about this Star Trek move is how it is self-containied. A non-fan could actually watch this movie and still enjoy it, while the hard core fans of the series will find plenty of suttle references. For example, key characters have been promoted and other cast members who made their apparent final exit in the TV series are back without explination. I let this slide, because I believe the intent of the creative team was to not waste screen time explaining away things only to appease the hardcore fans, they wanted it to be just a good sci-fi movie.<br />The second thing that that really sets Nemesis apart from the other Trek films is its pace, Nemesis is very much an action film from start to finish, it moves very fast. That's a good thing, because many Trek films are slow and boring (only pleasing the hard core fans). I'm being careful not to give any plot details away, but the story-line is interesting, in the action scenes we see a lot of things never seen before in Star Trek.<br />The only flaw here is lack of  character development, and for the hard core fans, a Trek film being reduced to a generic sci-fi action movie, but a good one no less.
B000021YQV|3.0|THIS CD ISNT AS GOOD AS THEIR OLD CD. TO ME,I THINK THE OLD ONE IS ALOT HEAVIER, NOW THEY JUST PLAY WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO HEAR.
B00005JKG9|4.0|This movie has the perfect cast.  There hasn't been a movie made since with such an all star cast(When Kevin Spacey gives the weakest performance you know you've got a phenomenal cast).  And the script is well written.<br />So where's the problem?  The movie is a character study.  It fails to say anything except about the specific characters involved.  The desperation of Lemmon's character isn't conveyed as anything more than his own problems.  Mamet could have used this movie as a statement about the pressures of the working man.  Instead it becomes too specifically attached to the characters involved.  This isn't to say it isn't a great character study but I was hoping for just a little more with such a cast.
B00004Z459|4.0|SOME OF THE STUFF ON HERE SOUNDS THE SAME, SO I GIVE IT 4 STARS. IT IS A VERY GOOD CD.
B000031WD9|4.0|American Pie is a great teen movie about 4 teenage boys on their quest to have sex before they graduate and they learn how hard it is and I reccommend this movie if you are a teen or a grown-up.This movie also has girls, 5 of them.One is Nadia, the Swedish girl that likes Jim (Jason Biggs) & there's Heather which is Oz's (Chris Kline) girlfriend & Vicky which is Kevin's (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Michelle which is a band geak but likes Jim also.This unrated DVD is the same as the regular DVD so don't waist money and just buy the regular DVD or you can buy number's 1&2 unrated together for a price that's not to high.I think you should see this movie because it's funny and I guess you can learn something about sex and I hope this review is helpful.
B000068UXF|5.0|No need for me to add to what the others have said - the only sad thing is that this performance isn't available on c/d as well...<br />I have to wonder if the opera was ever this well performed in its creators' lifetimes.  I doubt it.
B00005JLRR|2.0|Next generation? More like last generation, or your father's generation. I fell asleep midway through this movie, and by the time I came to it was the same old concluding space battle, shields losing power with perfect dramatic timing. The enemy looked like Dr. Evil and seemed about as menacing.
B000069AUI|5.0|It still astounds me how some Americans are still trying to adversely compare all Brit Rock acts to Radiohead. Radiohead are old news in the UK, and maybe if British music got more attention worldwide, more people would see what the likes of Coldplay and Travis have to offer.<br />A Rush Of Blood To The Head is simply gorgeous. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be \\"flawless\\".<br />The emotion that is evident in the lyrics and music alike adds a lot to the catchy tunes and enchanting melodies.<br />This is without doubt, THE album of 2002, and that is the accolade that has been bestowed upon it by countless magazines, such as Q. Coldplay were named best British act at the MTV Europe awards.<br />I have no idea what the music industry is like in the US. But the impression we get of it here in the UK is that it's all heavy, unimaginative rock (System Of A Down etc) or HipHop (which 90% of it is a load of rubbish).<br />I compell any international music lovers, whatever genre of music you are into, give this record a try. You'll love it.
B000008LUN|5.0|PHENOMENON is the first of six masterpieces that UFO put out during the 70s. The opener, \\"Too Young to Know\\", is a hot piece of midtempo rock & roll, but the rest is quite good, too, especially the drawn-out jammer \\"Rock Bottom\\", which is UFO's answer to \\"Free Bird\\" or \\"Green Grass And High Tides.\\" The ballad content is higher than on subsequent UFO albums, but the rockers are good enough to make this a true masterwork from one of the most unjustly overlooked bands of the 70s.

B00003CXBH|5.0|When I saw this film for the first time, I had no expectations at all.  When the credits rolled, I was just sitting there in awe.  It stirred my emotions as few films have.  I have been looking for this film on the dvd format for years now, and eagerly await its release.  This film is at the top of my must own movie list.  Hopefully others share this opinion, and hopefully the studio will release it on dvd soon.
6304479689|5.0|After the success of \\"That's the Way It Is\\" in 1970, Elvis took his successful Vegas comeback out on the road, and rose to even greater peaks as a performer in the 1971-72 period. Over the course of the two years, significant change in his voice, repertoire, and personal life had transformed him into a very different, though no less dynamic entertainer.<br /><br />1972's \\"Elvis on Tour\\" captures The King's 15 city tour in the Spring of 1972, held up by fans as some of the greatest performances of his career, giving legendary concerts in cities such as San Antonio, Hampton Roads, Greensboro and Richmond. Throughout the tour, he was in strong voice (albeit not quite as controlled or focus as in 1970), and his energy level was at a record high. The TCB band had also really hit their stride, and they never sounded tighter than they did during this period.<br /><br />The film is broken up in different segments from town to town, interspersed with backstage footage of Elvis jamming on gospel numbers, traveling from town to town, and working on new recordings. A certain sadness permeates some of these sequences, especially the shot of Elvis traveling to Florida, looking out the window with a distant, reflective look on his face. The recording of \\"Separate Ways\\" is also a poignant scene, as his  marriage to Priscilla was crumbling and the lyrics clearly hit home. He has changed greatly since 1970: his hair is longer, his attire is gaudier, his voice has a different edge to it, and he's a bit puffy and pale in the face. In many ways, we are seeing early signs of Elvis's inner demons beginning to make themselves evident, though he still had enough control to keep them from overwhelming his public presence.<br /><br />Despite these entertaining diversions, the music is center stage in the film, and there are some absolutely stunning renditions captured here: \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" \\"An American Trilogy,\\" and \\"You Gave Me a Mountain\\" are vocal tour de forces with great dramatic flare; a rough early go at \\"Burning Love\\" is a lot fun; \\"A Big Hunk O' Love\\" rocks like nobody's business and leaves the original in the dust, and \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" is a down and dirty blues / gospel hybrid that is maybe my single favorite Elvis performance of his career.<br /><br />\\"Elvis on Tour\\" is a terrific rockumentary, showcasing The King in the midst of his last truly consistent slate of great performances. The dvd contains no extras, but it's still nice to finally have it to add our collection.amatic flare; a rough early go at \\"Burning Love\\" is a lot fun; \\"A Big Hunk O' Love\\" rocks like nobody's business and leaves the original in the dust, and \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" is a down and dirty blues / gospel hybrid that is maybe my single favorite Elvis performance of his career.<br /><br />\\"Elvis on Tour\\" is a terrific rockumentary, showcasing The King in the midst of his last truly consistent slate of great performances.

6305827079|5.0|This newly released video of Elvis's 1970 concert film &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot; is better than the original, which was overshadowed by 2 many interviews. This tape focuses on just the<br />music.<br />It kciks off with Elvis rehearsing for his second season in Las Vegas, where he staged a successful comeback to live performing a year before. This segment features Elvis playing around with his band. In one scene, Elvis sings &quot;That's All Right&quot;, and the microphone falls off the stand, and he continues to sing. Rehearsing for the tour meant for Elvis that he didn't need to be serious. The concert, however, is serious. It kicks off with a torid &quot;That's All Right&quot;, then culminates with a heartbreaking &quot;Can't Help Falling In Love&quot;. Also included are stellar performances of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;The Wonder Of You&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin&quot; and &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;. That's the way it is is the way it should have been in the first place.
B00005JLRR|5.0|After watching Nemesis today, you get that feeling that something was ending.  Despite what the actors keep saying, this actually looks like the last hurrah for the TNG cast.  But what a way to go out.  The movie was excellent.  Star Trek has always been successful when they keep their plots into the darker tones of science fiction hence the even numbered TREK films are considered the best ones.  Some things are left to be desired, simply because certain characters arrive and there's no explanation why they're back on the ENTERPRISE.  Namely, WORF.  Ah well, it doesn't take away from the full movie experience and the ending was somewhat appropriate and somehow eerie since this definitely felt like closure.  A little sad, too.  Not what you would expect from a Star Trek film but nevertheless, there were a few wet eyes when we left the theater.  If you're not a Trek fan, you'll still enjoy it but if you are a true Star Trek fan, this one not to miss.  Perhaps the best in the series definitely the best out of the TNG films, but it's the end of something special.  So many fans line up for Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.  Now it's time for Star Trek fans to represent for Nemesis  If we do, then maybe it wasn't a generation's final journey after all.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is really a GREAT CD!!!  Too many people complain about the songs on it, but if you really like Nirvana it is essential to your collection.  Of course it is gonna have songs on it from other CDs that is what makes it a greatest hits CD.  \\"You Know You're Right\\" is a unique and very skilled song!  Once again, all Nirvana collectors MUST HAVE this CD!!!!!!  I can't stress enough how good this CD really is, with different versions of many songs that many may not have ever heard, and with one previously unreleased song (except for at concerts).  This CD is well worth your time and money.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Many have noted how influential this album is, but few have mentioned just how truly unusual Slayer's creative vision was at the time of this album's release. Their experiments with song structure still sound fresh more than 15 years later.<br />Each individual song is packed with enough riffs to carry an entire album---even the relentless \\"Necrophobic,\\" a track less than two minutes long, features several different guitar figures, multiple tempo shifts, and a roaring guitar solo from both guitarists. ... <br />Slayer were also bursting with creative musical ideas:  Witness the unexpected 5/8 riff near the beginning of \\"Jesus Saves,\\" and the screeching halt at the the end of the same track; the gradual shutdown at the end of \\"Altar of Sacrifice\\"; and the hard cut to the thunderstorm at the end of \\"Raining Blood.\\"<br />This album is recommended for all fans of challenging, creative music.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I am surprised that I like this chick flick very much.  This movie is romantic, elegant and truly capitivating.  This is one of the best movies I have seen.  DVD version however, did not deliver the value I expected.  The discussion about the making of the movie is brief and definitely not indepth.  Get the VHS, you did not miss much from the featurette.

B00000055E|4.0|Ive seen a few reviewers give this album a low rating, but for no good reason. This is probably Pac's best post humuous release to date [outside of Makaveli of course].....Yea, it has some filler, like most double cd's do, but overall, its pretty solid and is a must for any 2Pac fan. Its not as good as All Eyez On Me [his best double cd to date], but this was recorded in a different era than AEOM was. AEOM was part of Pac's \\"Death Row\\" era, while R U Still Down was recorded between 92' and 94', though it wasnt released until 97', a year after his death.<br />Disc 1 starts off with a beautiful acoustic intro, and follows with a classic raw song, \\"Open Fire\\".....\\"Fu*k All Yall\\", \\"R U Still Down\\", \\"Thug Style\\", and \\"Lie To Kick It\\" are all great songs, but the true gem of Disc 1 is \\"Hellrazor\\". This is easily one of Pac's finest songs ever, depicting him at his rawest and most emotional. Overall, Disc 1 is a solid 3.5/5.......<br />Disc 2, in my opinion, is the better of the two discs. The first three songs (Ready 4 Whatever, When I Get Free, and Hold On] are all gems, as are Nothin But Love, 16 On Death Row, Do for Love, and I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto......the album closer, Only Fear Of Death, is my fav song on the disc. Its one of the darkest, grittiest songs he ever made, as well as one of the most haunting, as he predicts his own death. Disc 2 is a solid 4.5/5<br />If you are expecting some Death Row type material here, you wont get it. This album is younger, rawer, less experienced Pac. Most of these songs were recorded between the Strictly 4 Niggaz sessions and the Me Against The World sessions. But aint nothing wrong with that. This is one of Pac's most underrated albums. Dont listen to the people who say this album is disappointing, this is a MUST HAVE for any Tupac fan.....

0679805273|1.0|I cringe every time my son (4yrs old) has me read him this book.  I hate it.  The basic premise -- if you don't like where you are, get up and leave it all behind for great adventure, and when that doesn't work out, you'll have to figure it all out for yourself and then you'll be back at it, unless that doesn't work out... etc.  The premise is not only flawed, it runs counter to everything I'd like him to learn: that he is surrounded by love and the support of his family and friends, and that when the going gets tough he shouldn't just leave town; he should learn to value trusted relationships to help him overcome challenges.  The book has no sense of family, love, or other type of support, and while it does say &quot;kid, you'll move mountains&quot; it forgets to say &quot;kid, you're well-grounded and loved&quot; and that is a fatal error by Seuss.  Also, the language (complex - &quot;dexterous and deft&quot;) is not suitable for young readers.

This movie is SO funny all the way through; characters such as the French Taunter, Knights of Ni, the &quot;undefeatable&quot; Black Knight, and Brave Sir Robin offer rich satires of the Legends, and episodes such as the witch trial and the tirades of the peasants also offer hilarious and clever looks at the reality of medieval times.  The Monty Python team has the wonderful mixture of deep intelligence and right-on humor down to a science--and the resulting film &quot;M.P. and the Holy Grail&quot; is a real work of art.  YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!
B00006690G|5.0|He is clearly not for the squeamish, but if you are open minded enough to see through the vulgarity you will experience some of the greatest lyrics of these times.  Not since Bob Dylan has their been such poetry. He speaks of a life style that I have never lived so it's interesting to see things from his point of view.  His life was rough, yet he is living proof that only in America can someone from the mean streets of Detroit grow up to perform excellence.  And only in America can he have license to do that, and he does it so well.
630027179X|1.0|because I really didn't think it was good at all.  First of all, it's boring.  The first time I tried to watch it, I feel asleep.  Second of all, I wasn't impressed at all by the acting.  the only character I thought was believable was Merlin--and admittedly the Merlin of EXCALIBUR is one of my favorite portrayals of him--but his scenes with Morgana were just ridiculous.  I didn't care for the fantasy land she trapped him in at all.  And, speaking or Morgana, I know this is trite, but she is just not convincing with blond hair!  Plus, she was too much like a dominatrix or something in this film.  I know she's supposed to be evil, but she was pretty anachronistic in this portrayal.  Overall I'd say, if you want a good film portrayal of the Arthurian legends, your best bet is the Mists of Avalon, the TNT miniseries.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Antichrist Svperstar is a very obscure kind of record. This, along with Tool's 1996 nima, and Reznor's '94 release \\"The Downward Spiral\\", really shaped modern rock music into what it would become. <BR>  This record was the band's first, kick in the teeth serious record. Smells like Childern had enough tracks to be an LP, but really was more based on fillers and skits. However, with this record, the band kind of entered a whole new mind set. Anyone who really wants to learn about this record or the preformance for this record should look up the angelyxx Archives on AOL. There are 2 essays, one about the artistic structure of the live preforance, as well as interpertations of the songs.<BR>The man behind the complicated sound structure of this record was Trent Reznor. Without him, this album would have sounded more like Holy Wood. I don't think anyone can disagree with me on that front. Regardless, this is an excellent record, and makes good use of intellect and intelligence. I believe the first review told how they experimented with sleep deprevation, kaballah, numerology, mutilation, drugs, etc...<BR>Check this one out. Its better than a lot of other records by other bands. And if you get this, you got to have The Downward Spiral and nima...
0800129806|3.0|but not so good as Arthurian legend.  The story is simply changed too much.  Although Connery, Gere, and Ormond are excellent choices to play Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere respectively, I just couldn't get into it.  The love story between Lance and Gwen isn't even the same as in the traditional legend.  But, as I said, if you don't care if it strays from tradition and you are looking for a good love story, this film is a good bet.
B00006RU5B|4.0|.... <br />over all i love Audioslave.<BR>it took awhile for me to come to terms with Chris's voice. I definitly prefer Zach. but i like this new road Tom, Tim and Brad are taking. it lets them branch out from the rap metal they've been doing for years, and proves that when it comes to just plain hard rock. they can blow all these new bands out of the water. if you want a proper rethro rock band (resembling Led Zeppelin) then Audioslave is it. Forget the \\"the...\\" bands. they've got too much arogance and not enough talent when compared to the 'mature' RATM and Soundgarden crossbreed.<br />this album is not going to appeal to everyone. but that's just another reason why it's one of my new favourites.
6303431038|4.0|\\"Wyatt Earp\\" tries, in only three hours, to portray fully the broad sweep of the life of a complicated man living in tumultuous times.  In large part it succeeds.  Costner's Earp is well thought out, and beautifully acted. Costner takes us from the young, warm, wide-eyed western newcomer, filled with ambition, who, as personal trials and tragedy follow him, grows ever harder and colder, until he is a match for the hard and cold world in which he lives.  Then he meets Josie, who begins to thaw him out just as he must be harder and colder than ever.  \\"Go home, Josie,\\" he tells her at the critical moment, \\"thinking about you could get me killed.\\"  He doesn't get killed, of course; despite the thaw, when he must, he rises to the challenge.  Thinking that such events are behind him, more tragedy befalls him, and he finds more demands fall on him--horrible and difficult demands--before he can again warm to Josie's love.  Costner captures all this perfectly.<br />Dennis Quade's performance as Doc Holliday nothing short of astounding.  Quade is transformed; he IS Doc.  This is surely the closest we'll ever come to seeing the actual man.  He perfectly captures the acerbic, resent-filled Holiday, condemend to an early death by disease, trying to cheat his comsumption through reckless, fatal confrontations.  His caustic wit and belligerent personality have driven away anyone who might be his friend--everyone but Wyatt.  This is surely one of the oddest friendships, and difficult to understand.  In the scene where they meet, Doc laments that he will never see his native Georgia again.  \\"I'm sorry\\" says Wyatt.  Quade's Doc's eyes flash as they jerk up to study Earp; he's clearly ready to fly into a homicidal rage if he detects the least falseness.  But his glare is met by Costner's steady, unflinching, guileless stare.  Doc seems surprised, then pleased, in a roundabout way he proposes they be friends and extends his hand to Earp.  Nothing more is needed to explain the odd friendship between the two men.  It's a richly textured scene with many layers of understanding, perfectly acted by Quade and Costner--who both obviously understand their characters.<br />Historically accurate?  No.  His brothers never worked as lawmen in Dodge; Doc was merely grazed on the hip at the famous gunfight and never left his feet; only Morgan, among the Earp party, was down when the shooting stopped; Wyatt never stole a horse--at least in the way portrayed in the film; and much more.  But \\"Wyatt Earp\\" is certainly much more true to history than any other movie about Earp.  We can forgive the dramatic digressions because there is so much that goes far in telling the history.<br />It's long, but it needs to be.  I found no part of it dull--though some scenes could have had better pacing.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I watch it over and over, and I enjoy it each time.  I join the chorus asking for it to appear on DVD.
0316666343|4.0|This is supposed to be a sad book but the writer gives you reasons to rejoice.  A chilling tale of a sad event with a gleam of hope.  Sebold is an enganging writer.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Okay so you've heard Rage Against the Machine and you've heard Soundgarden.  Forget about that because Audioslave is it's own band.  If you have a thing for Rage or Soundgarden go listen to THEIR CDs.  This album has got a lot of variety to it.  Most songs however are just plainly very powerful.  Cornell's voice sounds amazing.  The guys from Rage perform together solidly like always.  There's not much missing.  I'd have to say the best tracks on the album are &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Gasoline&quot;, &quot;What You Are&quot;, &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Getaway Car&quot;.  Definitely a favorite among my collection and a CD any rock fan should pick up.
B00007BH3A|5.0|The previous review is a little bit off target.  It turns out that the track listing on Amazon.com is incorrect - the bonus tracks are featured on a supplemental second disk, and the first disk contains the entire album in its original form.  No tracks have been removed.
0441172717|3.0|I am not making a comment on the story, but if you love this book and you're thinking of buying it, don't get this edition. The book is not very sturdy and is poorly bound. Let's face it, it's a big book! And it needs to be well made so that the binding doesn't break halfway through the book. :(
6301223543|5.0|This is not a typical \\"spook\\" horror movie.  The realism of brutality that this movie shows is scary (something like this could actually happen).  The rape scenes are graphic and lengthy so women should prepare themselves.  Most of the revenge/ murder scenes are also graphic, and may be considered equally disturbing or justified.  This is one of those movies that stays in your mind after viewing.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Along with the 70's cultural phenomenon 'Star Wars' and the later monumental 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind', 'Logan's Run' injected enduring respectability into the science fiction genre helping give way to the studios willingness to produce big budget sci-fi.  Though there had been earlier successful financial ventures into the field of science fiction ('Planet Of The Apes', 'Westworld', etc.) the release of these three would push the genre over-the-top and open the door for all the mega-buck blockbusters that have followed.<br />Distinguished by dazzling special effects for it's time, 'Logan's Run' continues to gather a strong cult following even within the core of today's sophisticated film fans.  The combination of intelligent storytelling, a superb synthesized music score interpolated with some orchestral arrangements and both inspired set and scenic design prove too irresistible for nearly everyone.  But perhaps what provides the movie it's biggest reason for longevity is the exemplary cast; featuring Michael York, Jenny Agutter and Richard Jordan in the three primary leads, their terrific performances propel this cinematic treat.  Besides the star trio 'Logan's Run' also has memorable portrayals by Peter Ustinov as the \\"Old Man\\" and Roscoe Lee Browne as \\"Box\\" a robot sentry that York and Agutter encounter during their attempt to find the secret paradise of Sanctuary.  The two veteran film actors steal every scene they're in; Browne is actually inside the robot mechanism making all those movements we see - and his resonating voice imbues the odd-looking sentry with a foreboding sense of evil.  Ustinov reportedly adlibbed much of his own dialogue at the insistence of the film's director Michael Anderson.  The \\"Old Man\\" will be etched into your mind forever once you see this remarkable performance.  70's pop culture sensation Farrah Fawcett appears briefly in the pivotal role of Holly, just prior to the launching of the television series \\"Charlie's Angels\\".<br />Since it's release in 1976 'Logan's Run' has been superceded by many science fiction and fantasy films of superior quality, aided immensely by the many technological advances in computer generated animation and all areas of special effects.  Personally I find that only a few them achieve the same inestimable factor of entertainment that this film does.  Also, like me the film's many ardent fans, most of whom have fond sentimental memories of this film, do not forget it's importance to this genre or fail to recognize it's influence upon several movies that have followed in it's wake.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a significant view of being a soldier.  It is war, and many events happen in the heat of battle and survival that change a man.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|This movie was [bad].  The extras on the DVD were fun, most fun was the short film included in the previews section. Don't bother, it's a rental.
B00007BH5C|3.0|To put it short, this soundtrack probably doesn't even have 8 bars of consistant tunes. In fact, it gets annoying when you expect one good tune, and get nothing but long drawn out orchestra that doesn't have any consistancy. <br />I admit it is good &quot;music&quot;. But bad tunes and melody. Get what I am trying to say?<br />John Williams would blow this thing right out the window as far as I am concerned.<br />I hope the movie makes up for it. I am a very dissapointed fan of this soundtrack.<br />Maybe they made it real bad, so that the next one will sound that much better? I hope.<br />And the music in the trailers is abscent from the soundtrack. And apparently the movie. (which is bad news)<br />I find the music in the trailers for TTT better than this entire soundtrack.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|The sound and video are outstanding!  This is my second copy.  We literally wore out the first copy from repeated viewings.
B000007T1M|5.0|i frist heard thses guys when i was around 14 years old. unlike most bands i listened to around that time(korn limp bizkit ect)which i am now humiliated to admit to ever liking, system of a down are still one of my all time faourtie bands. all the members of the band are legitamitly talented, and , unlike many modern bands, show it. the songs are unique(you don't feel like you brought a remix album) and the lyrics are a perfect mix of socail comentary and simply fun non sence. the hight energy atomoshere and weirdness of this album never gets boring. so in concultion , system of a down is not an non talentless-run-of -the-mill 'nu-metal' band and this album is hightly recomended.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Of all the Disney movies, this has to be my favorite.  I remember my little one giggling the whole movie long.  The characters are absolutely adorable.  The story line keeps them interested the entire movie.  Mike and Sulley are hillarious.  I can't think of a better present!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Having read the &quot;Spotlight Review&quot; above I felt I had to add my .02 I have only been listening to DT for perhaps a year, but have gotten to listen to most of their CDs, and found them all quite lovely. This 2-CD release features a harder edged sound than previous works, but maintains the softer side that we've come to expect from DT. <br />Disc one's &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; clocks in at just under 14 minutes. This has to be one of the hardest songs ever recorded by DT. This song is about overcoming life's problems, and the depths that some will feel on their quest to begin anew. The opening riff (later reprised) leaves me panting for more.<br />&quot;Blind Faith&quot; and &quot;Misunderstood&quot; follow with a slower change of pace.<br />Another almost 14 minute piece, &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, looks at the stem cell debate, and doesn't quite decide which side its on. But perhaps it doesnt matter, John Petrucci does a fine job of presenting both the pros and cons. The band launches through a number of time changes here, each charged with a lot of energetic drive. This is probably one of the best songs on the CD.<br />&quot;Disappear&quot; ends the first CD. It is an introspective end, that i don't really find all that exciting. Perhaps someone will find it pleasing.<br />The 42 minute long &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; takes up all of the 2nd CD. This work concerns itself with various forms of mental illness, both how it is percieved by those who are suffering and those that can only watch from the outside.<br />The opening track &quot;Overture&quot; may at first seem a bit pretentious... but after a few listens it struck me as a quite beautiful little piece. <br />&quot;War Inside my Head&quot; and &quot;The Test That Stumped Them All&quot; provide the harder edges, and they work quite well in portraying the frantic illnesses the &quot;speaker&quot; faces.<br />&quot;Goodnight Kiss&quot; is a much slower, and very lovely bit of dripping sorrow. The little girl yawning &quot;Goodnight Momma&quot; is particularly touching. (Goodnight honey, wherever you are) <br />The final 3 tracks, are less frantic but no less stunning htan the rest of the CD. If anything these last 3 are the strongest and most poignant of all. <br />&quot;Solitary Shell&quot; tells us the story of someone we've all seen at least once in our lives. The completly anti-social person that barely manages life. The instrumental interlude at the end of this song is riveting and lush.<br />The upbeat &quot;About to Crash&quot; message is garbled and confused, much like its &quot;speaker&quot;, who decides to carry on even though all is not well.<br />&quot;Losing Time/Grand Finale&quot; is gorgeous. Highly charged emotionally and more than a little evocotive of Yes in its final moments, it makes for a rousing end to this CD. Words can really fail to convey the impact of this final track...you really have to hear it.<br />I really cannot recommend this CD highly enough...Intellignt and Emotional this release seems to have it all. <BR>Well done, gentlemen.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is the first cd I can truely say made me feel like getting up and dancing (or skanking) across my room, and I did infact during &quot;Junkie's Runnin' Dry&quot;.  Op Ivy rocks.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. The music, the acting, the drama, what more can you ask for? Nicole Kidman surprised me withe her performance. I admit at first I was a bit skeptical about the movie. But then I saw it and it was just wonderful. The soundtrack is just as good. The costumes, the setting makes everything so peculiar. The movie is unique and the acting superb.<br />&#34;All you'll ever need is love&#34;
B00005R6FD|4.0|For an early album, especially a first live album Unleashed in the East is an unexpected surprise.  The energy projected during the concert is captured well and when played against the studio recordings of the same songs, the live versions on this album are almost always more enjoyable.  Victim of Changes puts you right in the audience, the epic song will give you goosebumps.<BR> <BR>The album was originally intended to be given away only in Japan as a souvenier of the tour, but the bands enthusiasm listening to the tracks prompted them to edit the recording (at Ringo Starr's house) and use as a worldwide release.  Rob Halford was suffering a cold during the concert dates, and a few of the vocals were dubbed in during the editing by Halford running out on Starr's patio and re-creating the poorly sung notes.  <br />A great addition to anyone wanting to be projected to 1979 and have a listen to the early gods of metal.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is great.  I am impressed that they manage to sing in English with the level of emotion that they do. (I am sure that if I tried to sing in another language, I would be laughed at.)  I like the Russian versions a little better since they are a little edgier, and not as cleaned up (the lyrics have changed, especially on Malchick-gay).  And \\"Robot\\" on the Russian version is by far one of THE best dance songs out there.  That said, the English version is FABULOUS!  The production, thanks to Trevor Horn (who's worked with other dance-pop acts such as Pet Shop Boys), resonates very well.  (The cover of the Smith's \\"How Soon is Now?\\" is quite good, though I imagine that many of the target demographic will be going \\"Hey!  It's that song from 'Charmed'!\\".  Pity.)  I love T.a.T.u./Taty/Tatu and I hope we get a few more albums out of them.  Buy this album immediately.  (Besides, the Russians really do need all the help they can get!)
6304698658|5.0|Let me just say, that I like this movie for one reason, because it actually tells the truth, Not all of us are happy on the holidays, and we may not be getting a big bonus, or we could be having a very sick cousin, or everyone really does not want to see each other. This is why this film is funny, it doesn't put itself behind a charade and make itself something it's not it shows people what a terrible christmas would be like, and I think people laugh at this because they know that they could never be in these situations, plus most of the situations Chevy Chase and Company get in simply are a hoot. If you want the &quot;other&quot; true meaning of christmas get this movie.
B000069HKH|4.0|if you are a springsteen fan of at least 15-20 years, you can't help but hear the echoes from albums like the river, born in the usa and greetings from asbury park.  waiting on a sunny day, the third track on the album will have you convinced, in a good way, that you've heard the song before and you've filed already in your springsteen classics folder.  the big band fun of the fully assembled e street band is back and running on all cylynders on sunny day. the triumphant organ in lonesome day, recalls the orchestral quality of born in the usa.  lonesome day, a song about surviving betrayal, is a springsteen best.  but prepare youself for what i believe to be one of his all time great songs - nothing man.  this song, where the lyrics are delivered with an unveiled honestly and isolation, explores the feelings of guilt from a man who survived the wold trade center attack.  \\"the sky is still, the same unbelievable blue.\\" but the narrator goes on to sing that everything is as it was but he, the survivor, is changed.  the nothing man is a song of great insight into what most people will never experience... meeting death, watching others die and surviving to go on asking, \\"why me?\\"<br />into the fire, continues a reoccurring theme of ascension as the fireman in the song go \\"up the stairs, into th fire,\\" to meet an end they knew to be inevitable. over coming the fear of death by facing it head on.<br />the first song on side b, further on up the road, is the type of song you'll be singing before you've heard it all the way through the first time.  the hard rocking chorus and the momentum of the songs building and hopeful optimism, will bring you along for a ride powered by the engine of the genius of max weinbergs drums.  turn this one up loud and enjoy.<br />the rising, the albums title track, is another song the e street band comes alive on - bruce visits his gospel side on this song.  this album is a mix of content and production, between tunnel of love and born in theusa.  but you'll hear pieces of just about evry springsteen album you've ever heard.  a good bet for album of the year (but you'll have to skip a few songs that just don't measure up ,paradise and worlds apart, but that's a minor criticism in what is a reborn in the light of great rock and roll, springsteen album).  it won't take long for his one to settle in right along side some other great springsteen albums.<br />listen and listen often!
B00005LOUP|1.0|This movie is so bad, it's good, to just watch at how terrible Jim Carrey over-acts in this stinkbomb makes me laugh hard, not only the most unneccessary additions, including the Cheerleader title, which believe me I don't blame Ron Howard, who had to try and make a movie with a suitable running time, but that bit was unneccessary, I truly think that this film had hope but too much unneccessary material was introduced into the movie and it took away from the main story, granted I will tell you the costume design and art direction are simply astounding, but that's where it ends, I strongly believe that Tim Burton should have done this movie and probably would have made it absolutely stunning, if you want a real christmas movie, go rent the original grinch, or Christmas Vacation, it may be innappropriate, but it's a hoot.
B00005JLRR|4.0|I saw Nemesis on opening weekend and I wasn't disappointed. Although I was a dedicated fan of TNG, I didn't follow news about this movie. I just went to see it when it was released with no preconceptions. It was truly wonderful to spend time with the crew again, to see them in action. I loved Deanna's role in this film (she was always my favorite). Patrick Stewart is always excellent (I could watch him read the phone book) and the young actor playing his clone was just first class, so well-chosen. These features and an impressive battle including stellar special effects was all I needed for my money's worth. It was lovely to have the closure of Deanna and Will's marriage. It was sad to lose a member of the cast, but it was clear it was something that the actor wanted. I say bravo for a satisfying addition to the Trek canon.
B00006RY6W|5.0|I have just ordered, through Amazon, the SACD version of this disc. I, already have the GOLD version which is quite superb in sound. However, based upon my recent experience with SACDs, I thought that I should obtain a copy in this format as well.<br />Anyone who has listened to this disc in any format will, most certainly, agree that it is quite fantastic and timeless in it's appeal. 'Willy and the Poor Boys', perhaps more than any of their other discs, represents CCR at their zenith. I will never forget the total buzz of excitement that 'Willy'  generated when it was initially released. It's funky, simple, slap-your-knee casual jammin' down-on-the-corner quality was irresistable. It was immediately endearing and infectious.<BR>Who could have resisted it's obvious charms?<br />Although, I have always thoroughly enjoyed 'Green River' and 'Cosmo's Factory', 'Willy' has always remained my favourite disc of CCR's. 'Cosmo's'  marathon version of Marvin Gaye's ' I heard through the Grapevine' remains a monster of a tune of swamp-boogie funk.<br />I can not wait to hear thr SACD of this disc. I am sure that I will not be disappointed.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is standard Chris Cornell.  If you even heard of his Euphoria Morning solo album, you'll like this one.  The remainder of the boys from Rage due a spectacular job on this recording, but I don't think it will appeal to the hardcore Rage Against the Machine fan, who will most likely miss Zack's rapping and Rage's trademark sound.  I highly recommend it for the Cornell fan thought.

078062999X|5.0|To say Kenneth Branagh is on the mark would be the biggest understatement of the decade.  He not only nails Hamlet the character, but he also nails Hamlet the movie - as a director.  K.B. proves his mettle once again as the incomparable Shakespeare aficionado of our day.<br />Having just watched both K.B.'s and Laurence Olivier's versions back-to-back, I can unequivocally state that Branagh's emerges as not only more complete, but more enlightening as well.  Whereas Olivier leaves out Fortinbras entirely as well as countless lines, Branagh leaves you begging for more Shakespeare to be brought to the big screen - Macbeth would be nice.
B000063DI9|5.0|This is the master album of one of the best and more influencial band in the world. This album SSofSS, is musicaly a pearl, and purely a meltdwon of all the sens of the human being. It has a human character, an intro like Moonchild with an anger from the inside. After that a song like Infinite Dreams revelate a terrific philosophic reflexion of our existence. What else like the madness? Do you want to play with madness? Me too. It's too good, too more intelligence. What men do? Much evil? This is a good song about our bad feelings. And arrives the master of the masters, the title song SS of SS ,it 's all together, a song to the humanity, what we expect? A new will come with our good feelings and reflexions. Can you feel after the 4 beautiful and incredible solos of guitars, this melodic ascension...?<BR>The end is the definitive expresion! The rest of the album is in the same way, enjoy it! It has be created for you, human beings!
B00005K9LN|5.0|Rapid Fire, Metal Gods, Grinder, the list of genre defining tunes goes on. British Steel contains two of Judas Priest's most famous radio hits - Livin' after Midnight and Breaking the Law - but those songs are not really representative of the rest of the tracks. Those two are commercial hard rock radio classics but the songs that changed the direction of the genre are what make this CD one of the seminal works of heavy metal. Excellent rhythm and lead guitar work.
B0000025T6|5.0|The title of this review comes from a Tennessee Williams quote, \\"There is something wild in the country that only the Night People know...\\"<br />That quote demonstrates the essence of this album. That and the the power of desperation. Every one of these songs is about desperation -- circumstances and people -- somehow, a noose is sliding closed around each song's neck. Loss of youth, loss of life, loss of hope, everything is collapsing in songs like \\"Mansion on the Hill,\\" \\"State Trooper,\\" or \\"My Father's House.\\" Some argue that the final song, \\"Reason to Live\\" is the only real song involving redemption, but I disagree. There are tiny redemptions throughout the album, perhaps overshadowed by the wildness, the desperation, the anxieties of living in a shadowy world.<br />By titling the album Nebraska, Springsteen sets his sights on the heartland of America, he is talking, metaphorically, about the heart of our country. The American Dream -- the delusion which drives so many people's lives -- is a corrupter, rooted, this album argues, in desperation.<br />Powerful, powerful, powerful.<br />Listen once and be forever changed.
B00004VVND|4.0|Shot on a paltry budget of roughly a million dollars, Michael Crichton's Westworld echoes many of the themes that would appear in later, far more successful novels and films (\\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"The Lost World\\". Although shot on a slim budget, the film manages to overcome the thin production values by effective use of the MGM western sets and backlot as well as the Harold Lloyd Estate.<br /><br />Blu-ray Review:<br /><br />The single layer Blu-ray features framing very similiar to the original Warner DVD. The American Blu-ray is framed slightly differently. Which is right? Hard to say but since the original DVD was issued while Crichton was still alive, I'm assuming he would have said something if the framing had been incorrect for that version.<br /><br />The color timing for this edition is slightly different compared to the European version of this title. Again, this edition more closely resembles the American DVD in that regard.<br /><br />Definition and detail is improved over the DVD but keep in mind when the film was made--1973--so it isn't going to have quite the detail of a more recent film.<br /><br />The special features included here are nice to have even if there isn't a commentary track included for the film (Crichton's dead so someone else would have had to do a commentary track but with James Brolin and Richard Benjamin still alive we could have had an interesting discussion on the making of the film).<br /><br />The short featurette has some interesting comments from Crichton, behind-the-scenes footage as well snippets of one or two scenes that didn't appear in the finished film. It's presented in standard definition.<br /><br />We get the original short featurette that aired on TV (it looks rough), the original theatrical trailer as well as pilot episode for the short lived TV series \\"Beyond Westworld\\". \\"Beyond Westworld\\" had little to do with the film beyond the basic premise. It's presented in standard definition.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />The film deals with a Crichton constant theme---technology outpacing humanity's ability to deal with the moral implications. Disaster usually results because of a lack of understanding or overconfidence on the part of the scientist. Our two heroes played by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin travel to Delos--a Disneyland for adults. The amusement park is stocked with robots that allow a guest to experience the old west, Rome at the height of its power and the middle ages. Brolin and Benjamin select Westworld. There they experience the old west by participating in saloon fights, fighting bank robbers and killing rival gunslingers. The main gunsligher is played by Yul Brynner is a marvelous take off of his main character from The Magnificent Seven.<br /><br />The machines begin to malfunction injuring guests and putting both Brolin and Benjamin in harm's way as The Gunslinger hunts them down because he lost one too many gunfights. Science is powerless to stop the machines as they run wild.<br /><br />The direction is solid and well paced. The writing sharp and witty. Crichton was the first writer/director to introduce the concept of a computer virus destroying the programming of computers and machines. Remember, this was in 1973 prior to the widespread use of computers. Despite the fact that Crichton had to cut a major sequence from the film (and didn't even get to script or direct the opening \\"commerical\\" as there was a writer's guild strike going on at the time), Westworld is both entertaining and a great cautionary tale. In many respects, the lack of budget has prevented the film from aging--there aren't any attempts to build any futuristic vehicles (beyond the hovercraft seen briefly at the beginning).<br /><br />The DVD is presented in both standard and widescreen. The transfer is crisp and sharp looking with few analog artifacts (i.e., dust, dirt and scratches). It's a pity that the presentation is so bare bones as this film could benefit from a running commentaryfrom director Crichton or actors Brolin and Benjamin. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer. Westworld could have also benefited from a gallery of the promotional materials for the film and any existing outtakes. The colors are vibrant and the photography imaginative.<br /><br />Both Brolin and Benjamin give believable, strong performances. Brynner, though, is the gem here. His robot Gunslinger commands the screen whenever he's around. While the audience does root for the two main characters, it's the robotic anti-hero that proves the most compelling presence.<br /><br />So visit Westworld and stay for awhile. Just don't overstay your welcome or you might get a visit from a certain Gunslinger with a grudge....from director Crichton or actors Brolin and Benjamin.

0385508417|1.0|I thought this book had such potential.  It started out with the unique and unheard of idea of skipping Christmas because of the expenses, busy shopping malls, phonyness and shallowness that our culture has turned Christmas into.  I was really enjoying the story until Luther and his wife buckled under the pressure of their daughter coming home for the holidays and succumbed to the very idea that they were so against previous to her phone call.  This was a big disappointment!
B00005JLRR|3.0|As an avid Trek fan, of course I had to make the movie! Nemesis is probably the darkest Trek of them all but it could have been better. There were too many holes to allow me to give a full five stars such as: why put Wesley Crusher and Guinan in the wedding scene to never show them again (very brief cameo)? The story lines didn't always transition smoothly; the development of Picard's clone could have been done more effectively; etc.<br />However, the movie was entertaining, particularly for Trekkies. A few friends went with me that are not Trekkies and they thought it was \\"okay\\" but nothing earth-shattering.<br />Go see the movie or get it when it comes out on DVD - I'll certainly add it to my collection.
B000066NW0|3.0|This CD has some good songs...and some songs that are not so good.  \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Naked\\" really get to the heart of things, but some of the other songs can bore you to death.  Not only that, but the CD can be disappointing or a great excitement.  Whatever the songs are named, it's not very \\"complicated.\\"

The few that I do believe in don't look like E.T at all. <BR>What's so \\"Extra\\" about this terrestrial anyway. I got only my required ammount of terrestrials when I purchased this ridiculous DVD. There must have some kind of trick photography when they made this because I can't really believe in this at all.<BR>If the E.T actually declare war, I want to be on the winning side. I pledge my allegiance to our alien leaders, they must be far superior to us because they can light up their fingers.
B00000K19E|4.0|This movie is a great example of how a movie is suppost to be like. It has everything action , suspense , and even formed a little of a love content. Not forgetting the great plot. This movie really makes you think weither or not this is a for-sight of what the human race future could be like. The main characters (Neo ,Trinity ,Morpheus) played there roles very well giving the movie a extra aspect . <br />            The movie is very interesting on both platforms VHS and DVD except you get the extras on the DVD. I am looking forward to the next matrix movie &quot; Matrix: Reloaded &quot; and I feel that the wolds in for a big impact in this one as well.
B00005JKCH|4.0|What can I possibly say that someone else hasn't already? This movie is truly a dream come true for a long time Spider-man fan like me. After so many comic to movie adaptations, it's hard not to become a little bit weary of 'the next one'. But, here we are, and here we have a movie that actually succeeds in rising above the rest. There hasn't been a comic adapted this successfully since Tim Burton did Batman back in 1989, and Superman before that in 1978 (which sadly bodes that the next one will be in 2011!).<br />Many directors and artists in Hollywood claim to be fans of comic book heroes, but when it comes time for them to actually put it together they fail miserably. But not here. Sam Rami did what a true fan would do - stayed true to the source material - while maintaining the objectivity and realistic approach of a film-maker. But, while cinema demands certain structural devices for reasons of plot and pace, he has captured the essence of Spider-man and his history accurately, and instilled through Tobey Maguire a sense of the excitement that any teenager would feel in Peter Parker's situation.  Perhaps the only thing that disappointed me was the Green Goblin. The design is didn't have it's own identity, instead rendered like a stock ILM creature. There was no need to venture away from the comic designs of old, as the CGI generation of movies are all converging towards the same point of style. The older Green Goblin designs might have imbued a retro feel that set them apart from the rest of the current fare. Raimi, incidentally, also seems to suffer from Burton's inability to shoot clear, cohesive action scenes that last for any sustained period. It's not that he's a bad film-maker, it's just not his thing. One thing I absoluetly LOVED, though, was the inverted kiss, between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, which just oozes with sexuality.<br />The DVD is packed with extras, as you can see. Most of them are interesting enough, although personally, extras have almost lost their appeal, like a novelty, and I find myself simply going for the films that I like, rather than the rest.almost lost their appeal, like a novelty, and I find myself simply going for the films that I like, rather than the rest.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation made names for themselves by bringing speculative fiction to prime-time with a serious, long-running, and engaging series about a multicultural crew in a future where Earth's problems had mostly been solved.  Unfortunately, that formula never translated to the big screen.  The best Star Trek movies (what fans refer to as the \\"even-numbers\\" - Treks 2, 4, 6, 8, and now 10) are the ones that sidestep serious SF issues in favor of action and camp.  Look at the history: the odd-numbered, SF-oriented Treks involved V'ger, the Genesis Planet, God, and whatever was going on in Generations.  Every one of those films are almost universally reviled by fans. On the other hand, fighting a psycho, visiting the 1980s, making peace with Klingons, and defeating the Borg queen are the Trek movies everyone likes - and the Trek movies centered on action, camp, and outright humor.<br />Nemesis follows in this splendid tradition by offering the next \\"even\\" Trek, supposedly the last voyage of the Next Generation crew.  With everyone assembled for Riker's and Troi's wedding, the Enterprise-E picks up a strange signal on a pre-Warp world close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.  Of course, the investigate.  On a pre-Warp world, using the transporter violates the Prime Directive (don't interfere in stuff that ain't yours), but galavanting around in a shiny laser-equipped dune buggy is OK.  Picard gets a moment of pure joy as he tears around an alien desert, picking up parts of what turns out to be a prototype of Data.<br />No sooner does everyone get back to the ship than Admiral Janeway call Picard on the Interstellar Network, both establishing the nonexistent future of Voyager movies by revealing her new desk job and establishing the plot of the movie by ordering Enterprise to go to Romulus and discuss peace with the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire.  The new Praetor is Shinzon, a Reman.  Until Shinzon assassinated the entire Romulan senate, the Remans were the slaves and whipping boys of the Romulan Empire, a mix of 1920s-era Nosferatu-style vampires and modern, brooding high-school Goths.  Now, the Remans are a force to be reckoned with, because not only do they have an enormous battleship that fires Enterprise-sized torpedoes and has a new kind of radiation designed to wipe out entire planets, but they managed to build it all while they were miners and slaves.  Any race that can accomplish that deserves to rule the galaxy.<br />But the fun doesn't end there.  It turns out that Shinzon is a clone of Picard, who was at one time going to replace the good Captain. When the Romulans abandoned that project, instead of killing such a politically sensitive creature, they instead sent him to grow up bitter, resentful, and free of morals in a harsh mining environment.  Oops.  At any rate, Shinzon isn't interested in making peace - as if this wasn't obvious by his menacing visage and the sinister music that follows him around.  In fact, he's out to attack the Federation and use his nasty radiation on the unsuspecting inhabitants of Earth - and who better to stop him than Picard and company?<br />Nemesis follows the even-Trek formula to a T.  Yeah, it's campy, and there are some plot holes large enough to park Shinzon's ship for a little shore leave.  But that's what makes a good Trek movie, and Nemesis is better than average.  The only movie to successfully combine the SF elements of the show and the action of the films was The Undiscovered Country, and Nemesis doesn't come close to that, but for fun value and action sequences, it's right up there with Wrath of Khan and First Contact.  Fans who recognize the limitations of the Trek films should be duly impressed; the fanboys will no doubt pan it and complain.<br />Final Grade: Bulan senate, the Remans were the slaves and whipping boys of the Romulan Empire, a mix of 1920s-era Nosferatu-style vampires and modern, brooding high-school Goths.

There are great Spa backdrops, a trip to a very odd indeed, Divorce/Dude Ranch, where miserable women commiserate while riding horses.<br />Don't despair, in the end true love and marriage win over lust and greed and Joanie gets her just desserts, in the restroom of a fancy-schmancy retaurant and Norma Shearer's true friends, rally round her.
6301763041|5.0|I love this movie. I first became a fan when VH1 used to show it late at night. Although it's a silly little story with not much plot and some random songs, this movie has more meaning to it than meets the eye. It's a great protrayal of love overcoming prejudice. Definitely one to see!
B00003CXAY|1.0|This movie tries to bind many ethinicities into images that are altered by mtv generation cliched visual effects.  Images of technology are trust together with images of poverty.  I find it frightening that by looking at the world in a way that is obviously altered by western thoughts, notions of what exsists in the world are biased and lead to harmful judgements.  Of course, someone who doesn't live in that foreign world can never truely understand what life means to a person who does live that forgien life.  But there are two many western thoughts and generalizatons for me to trust this movie as an expression of cultures.  This selling power is playing on that fact that these unknown images are presented as erotic (something that our culture looks upon as almost trendy).  The music increses this idea of eroticism.  While the music might be a beautiful piece, it is western in origin and add no truth to the images seen (except for mabey the images of western life, which there are some).  However, when you view images of india, the reality is is that most likely those are not the sound being heard.  <BR>In conclusion:  this movie tries to present truths that are purely visual.  They are devoid of sounds, smellls, and other senses.  Yes, film can only give you sight and sounds, but the sounds in this film are fruadulant to the truth that the film attempts to present.  As for the visuals, there is great power of juxtapostions. However, showing starvation in the streets followed by a large pepsi sign on a busy street are strong allegation of the western world versus the rest of the world that go unexplorated and unproven in this film because there is never a clear idea of the truth of either world.  As a member of western civilization, I not only understand that culture, i live that culture.  I do not live the life of the many other cultures presented in this movie and how these cultures are presented lead me to not recommend this movie.

B000068VHP|4.0|the bonus songs are still worth it if you already have this cd and have considered buying it.  I'd have to say though I'm pretty darn familiar with being able to tell when a cd has been \\"remastered\\" or not, and I can honestly say I hear no sound quality difference.  One of the easiest ways to tell if a cd has been remastered is when you notice you don't have to turn the volume up nearly as high to hear the music at louder levels.  Uh..this one's no different.  However, this has always been one of my favorite albums.. I absolutely love it.  So...if you're in the mood to get this debut album wrapped in cooler packaging, with some bonus songs, it will probably suit your fancy.
B00006I9HJ|5.0|I didn't know that Nada Surf had relead the new album untill this week. I got it from a girl in a bar, and I was so excited when I saw it. At the same moment i took it and went home to listen. All I can say - its fantastic.... they have grown as the musicians and songwriters. melodies are really unbeleveably good not anly in one or other song but through all album. They have explored new musical dymesions with drums, guitars... and in the end listenig to it i really can get into another reality (and i think that is where good music takes you).<BR>today a went home from university on foot. i could go by bus, but i didn't because than  the road would be short and i couldnt listen to the whole album. it was -15 degrees below zero and i walked 5 km... so yo see where it can take you....<BR>in the end i can say to all Nada Surf fans that this album is really great!!!

B00005JJUF|4.0|The Wachowski Brothers have succeeded in making one of the most fresh and innovative Sci-fi/action movies ever made, with a attention-grabbing storyline, nonstop action, and astrophysical acting performances across the board. Keanu Reeves (NEO) portrays an early sense of doubt and disbelief very convincingly, and makes a smooth transition throughout the film as he comes to terms with the \\"real world\\" and his struggle to save it. Laurence Fishburne,(MORPHEUS, the leader of the human resistance) delivers another exciting performance as his charisma and strong presence shine through in this movie. Carrie-Anne Moss (TRINITY) a member of Morpheus' crew as well as Neo's eventual love interest. The movie continues forward at backbreaking pace, offering enthralling plot twists, suspense-filled action sequences, and some of the best special effects ever to grace the big screen.

B000068TP0|5.0|Shakira's MTV Unplugged DVD is fantastic!  There's nothing like listening to and watching an artist perform unplugged, because you really get to see the real talent of the artist.  On this DVD, Shakira proves that she's got a great voice, a natural ability to entertain an audience, and that she can use her crativity to modify songs from her CDs and deliver a totally unique performance.  The sound is great!  The visual quality is great!  Great DVD!
B00006IUNN|4.0|I only watched this film because I'm a fan of actor Adam Beach, who plays Ben Yazzee.  It wasn't a great film, but it was good, I liked it much better than I expected to. I don't usually like war films, and those scenes were horrendous, but the interaction of the code talkers with the other Marines, and particularly the Marines guarding them, was very touching, and I was moved to tears by their ability to maintain their identity and spirituality in a hostile environment. In spite of what had been done to them by the white man, they were willing to put their lives on the line to save this country.  I'm glad to own this film. We owe these men our lives and it's heartening to see them finally recognized for the irreplaceable contribution they made to keeping alive a society which has mistreated them.
6303430570|5.0|CHASING AMY, MALLRATS, and DOGMA were, in my opinion, very lackluster and disappointing, though each had its very few funny moments.  They were all too mainstream.  Kevin Smith should never have deviated from the genre from which CLERKS hails.  He's a master of the indie film art.<br />There's not one boring character in this movie; my favorites are Jay and Silent Bob.  The ending, in which Silent Bob finally speaks, is a scream!  Totally realistic look at the nickel-and-dime drudgery of lower-rung retail jobs.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I watched this movie with mixed emotions. I knew it had been billed as the last movie to feature the cast of The Next Generation, and I was unhappy about that. On the other hand, as I left the theatre, I thought, \\"what a way to go out!\\"<br />This movie combines the best elements of Star Trek storytelling. It has humor, drama, surprises, cool tie-ins from previous Trek episodes and movies,and a stunning sacrifice. The comraderie between the cast, always good, has never been better. Patrick Stewart leads the way with a comfortable, focused performance that makes you wish they'd start shooting the series all over again. In fact, everyone in the cast does an excellent job. And the special effects and music are spectacular. (Just an aside here: if you're like me and have experienced frustration over the skimpy battle scenes in previous Trek movies, have no fear. Enterprise fights with every ounce of energy she has, and then some.)<br />The ending, although difficult to bear, contains hope. Nevertheless, be prepared for tears. As Patrick Stewart said in a recent TV Guide interview, this movie simply screams for a sequel (that's a paraphrase), and I hope that happens.<br />The story is excellently written. Cast members have hinted that if the movie does well, there may yet be another. Please do yourself and the cast a favor: ignore the reviews of critics who don't like Star Trek in the first place. This is a great movie. If it's truly goodbye, they went out with style. But it could be the doorway to bigger and even better things.<br />My best compliments to the cast and crew of Star Trek: Nemesis.
B00005JLSC|5.0|After numerous false starts and endless speculation as to casting, director, screenwriter, ad nauseum, Bob Fosse's legendary CHICACO finally hits the big screen.  Interest is high on whether or not Rob Marshall's dazzling take on the popular musical actually translates into the true revival of a moribund genre.  The end result? This is not a hot house flower like Baz Luhurmann's groundbreaking  \\"Moulin Rouge.\\"  CHICAGO channels Fosse's \\"Cabaret\\" by offering a more organic means of including songs in a narrative without distancing its audience.  While it may not have the MTV sheen of \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" CHICAGO is no less invigorating or exciting.  If anything,  it is another riveting example of how a new generation of filmmakers is giving the screen musical a powerful breath of life.<br />Featuring an ensemble of stage veterans with faces you never expected to belt out a showtune, CHICAGO wins on every level. From Bill Condon's wonderfully acerbic adaptation to Marshall's sexy musical numbers and Colleen Atwood's drop dead gorgeous gowns, CHICAGO is pure fun. However, the real power comes from the \\"killer diller\\" pairing of Catherize Zeta-Jones (as Velma Kelly) and Renee Zellweger's surprising star turn as Roxie Hart.  Both deliver unforgettable performances that will surprise the hell out of a lot of people.  Both women look like their having the time of their lives and that gives the film plenty of lift.  The supporting cast, especially John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah are clearly up to the challenge and deliver terrific performances.  Even Richard Gere, who at times seems like he's going through the motions in recent projects,  has a glint of fun in his eyes.<br />Full of sizzle and sexy appeal, CHICAGO proves a more enjoyable evening than the long running revival that is a global phenomenon.  How the film affects the revival will be interesting.  While a live performance is always an enriching experience, CHICAGO the film proves an equally - and more cost effective -- way of enjoying this immensely winning piece of entertainment.  What I appreciated the most about Miramax's vision of the project was leaving the show alone and not to create a youthquake.  After a mediocre film year with few bright spots, the end of 2002 is truly saving the best for last and it goes without questions that CHICAGO is among the must sees.-- way of enjoying this immensely winning piece of entertainment.

That's why I think we should see her as a Girl Interrupted by madness, and that's why we should give this book credit!
0385474547|5.0|Achebe is one of the best writters of all time, without any doubt.  &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; follows the not so perfect life of Okonkwo in a not so perfect Ibo society in modern day Nigeria.  A most interesting aspect of the story is how Okonkwo is well off, and a nearly perfect protagonist, but still ends up going through un-told hardships.  The feeling of this book is further completed with the use of the native religion of the Ibo being real.<br />This book makes one question colonialization in a different light as well, because the book shows how the process of colonialization was slow but largely unstoppable... and scary in a sense.
B000000OQF|5.0|&quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; is on the best albums, let alone heavy metal albums of all time. The first song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; has to be the best track. Axl's screaming voice along with Slash's heavy guitar riff's make a combination to blow one's ears out. True rock n' roll. &quot;Paradise City&quot; is another great song. It's kind of a slow song, and if your'e a first time GNR listener, you should probably listen to &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; first. &quot;Sweet Child of Mine&quot; is a classic song. It's also a slow song, but it's got one of the best guitar riffs ever written. This album truly represents the spirit of GNR. Not to degrade their other albums, but if you put &quot;November Rain&quot; on this cd, it's practically a greatest hits album in its own. That's how good this cd is.
B000070WJE|5.0|I think too many people reviewing this album tend to write Robbie Williams off as a brat and therefore start off biased to anythin he does. Shame really, because the guy's much more than a popcorn munching teenybopper. Escapology is an album that sounds different from anything he's done before and covers a lot of new ground. Tracks like Feel, Revolution, The World's most handsome man, Monsoon and Hot Fudge are all first class and deserve extended airplay. The other tracks are excellent too, but special mention must be made of Me and my Monkey and Nan's song which are by far the best songs on the album. Don't mis the hidden tracks on the CD especially the second one which is a scream.<br />Go on give the guy a chance to grow on you. I promise you he's worth the trouble. Music needs characters like Robbie Williams to kee things interesting.

B00005JKES|5.0|if you've only seen Fire Walk With Me, watch how it all started...David Lynch is briliant andthe plot is twisted enough to keep you watching and guessing.
0380977788|5.0|Honestly, the reviewers for the professional library journals can be so pompous!  Gaiman absolutely has a handle on his audience in this and all his incredible ouevre.   The characterizations here are marvelous and so right on regarding contemporary suburban families.   The plot too, as always with Gaiman, is a page-turner from start to the comes-too-quickly end.  But the best thing about this book, which will appeal to the Potterphiles and Snicketites, is that it is so well-written and consummately literary in its myriad allusions to other dark fantasy, fairy tales, and film; the text literally resonates!   A good introduction to Neil Gaiman (lucky stiffs! what wonders await!) or a new favorite for longtime fans.

B00005QZ7U|2.0|...but I really didn't like this film.  I found it boring &amp; slow, melodramatic (hammy acting) &amp; without heart.  Sorry, but it just didn't move me!  I loved &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and was therefore really disappointed with this effort.
B000002AVF|5.0|&quot;Daydream&quot; is hands down one of the best pop albums of the 90's or all-time for that matter. It was the perfect mixture of pop and R&amp;B and couldn't be categorized as just one. Since her debut, Mariah's work had been steadily getting better with each album and this was the peak:<br />1. Fantasy- (5/5) My favorite Mariah song. The beat is irresistible and the vocals are incredible *not to mention she looked incredible in the video.* The song flew to #1 for 8 weeks.<br />2. Underneath the Stars- (4/5) Light-hearted and sweet, this song is relaxing.<br />3. One Sweet Day- (3.5/5) Mariah's biggest spending a record 16 weeks at #1, but is one of my least favorite singles from her. She and Boyz II Men sound awesome on it, but the song itself just isn't all it's cracked up to be.<br />4. Open Arms- (5/5) Music Box had &quot;Without You,&quot; Butterfly had &quot;Beautiful Ones,&quot; Rainbow had &quot;Against All Odds,&quot; Glitter had &quot;Didn't Mean To Turn You On,&quot; Charmbraclet had &quot;Bringing On the Heartbreak and Daydream's cover is &quot;Open Arms.&quot; A great choice for the album and hers is better than the original.<br />5. Always Be My Baby- (5/5) The #1 song of 1996. It's perfect pop, plain and simple. Another one of my favorites. A definite up-lifter. <br />6. I Am Free- (5/5) This song is a gospel-style tune and sounds like something that could've been on &quot;Emotions.&quot;<br />7. When I Saw You- (4.5/5) The chorus is beautiful and totally makes the song. Another perfect inclusion for the album. This is the Mariah I love.<br />8. Long Ago- (3/5) A sort of sultry R&amp;B tune that hints of things to come on future albums. It has a cool beat, but nothing special. It does add spice to the album, though. <br />9. Melt Away- (4/5) Sweet ballad. Has a catchy chorus that has been used so many times before and since but is easy to get hooked on.<br />10. Forever- (5/5) Gorgeous song. Has a sort of 50's vibe going. It was released as an airplay single and went top 10. Mariah sings it beautifully and I love the back-up singers in the end.<br />11. Daydream Interlude- (4/5) This is a cool addition to the album. I love the beat and music. Nothing to write home about, but it does add to the album.<br />12. Looking In- (5/5) A personal song. Very touching lyrics and an odd, but unique ending to such an up-lifting album. The piano is pretty.<br />This is what Mariah and pop music period are all about. Catchy melodies, beautiful vocals, and just great music. Although she went downdill after this, I think &quot;Charmbraclet&quot; will bring her back. It is her best album since this one.
B000001FFJ|5.0|This album has been overlooked. How, I don't know. It has everything to make it a bona-fide classic: it rocks, it lulls, it jars you out of your complacent little world for the hour that it is in rotation. Tom Waits is one of the best songwriters ever to put words on a tape, he's up there with Dylan,Springsteen,as well as Lou Reed, but he isn't ever accounted for.<br />This album is just a way to show that an amazing mind is capable of any type of musical expression. Beat Poetry, blues, rock..its all here in this amazing melting pot of music. In my opinion, this is the best of all his albums, with apologies to Closing Time. I understand that people get turned off because of his &quot;Cookie-Monster&quot; voice, but all it took for me to get used to it was a couple of listens, and then when he started singing in his &quot;normal&quot; voice, I just wanted him to let it rip again.<br />At some point, everyone has heard at least one song from this album--&quot;Downtown Train&quot;--as covered by Rod Stewart. Don't do yourself an injustice by settling for that poorly done version. Get the real thing.
B000066NW0|4.0|There's a lot of Avril promotion going on these days. It seems everywhere you go somewhere, someone is talking about her. It's no doubt she has become extremely popular. I didn't actually know what I felt about her when she first came out. Out of curiosity I bought the album after hearing &quot;Complicated&quot;, and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; on the radio a few times. The album grew on me as time went on, and I've enjoyed the album for the most part. Avril is a very talented young woman. Her lyric maturity needs to expand a little, but she's just 18, and the fact that she had a part in the songwriting of every track says a whole lot. You don't see Mandy or Britney taking so much of an effort on writing their own lyrics. She is original and I don't think she's trying to be someone she's not, like most singers do, today. &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; displays all of what I'm trying to say. &quot;I'm With you&quot; is also a promising single worthy effort and could easily be a chart success. Other songs like the hits &quot;Complicated&quot;, and &quot;SK8er Boi&quot; are also very fun and pop sprinkled. Overall, a nice album.
6304039506|5.0|\\"Every man's a king and I'm the king around here, and don't you forget it\\".  How could we forget? Marlon Brando was unbelievably great in this film! Even as a violent, mean spirited brute, you can't take your eyes off of him, and you can't help but love him ( By the way, the man looks amazing in a ripped wet t-shirt, wow!). Adding to the greatness of marlon, is the fact that Streetcar is one of the best plays ever written, and the rest of the cast is perfect. Highly recommended to anyone! Brando fans, if you haven't seen this one, \\"Whassa matter with you??\\"
0345347951|5.0|I enjoyed the book for it opens ones mind to the true strangths of the human race. The book is about aliens taking over earth and creating a utopia. But the costs are too high and few indivduals refuse to accept them. The book is undoubtably wonderful because I like the fact that it wasn't about one person, but a whole group; the human society. It was about their coming to terms with the Overlords. It showed all the human natural characteristics like curiosity, hatrid, and resentment. If you love sci-fi books then you should indubatively read this one. Peace, I'm out. <BR>PS Fan Club of BHS
B0000542D2|4.0|Of course the music is brilliant. I was disappointed with the sound too - a few other people wrote about that here - but I wasn't aware that the sound was supposed to be 'enhanced', I just figured that was the best they could get from the original soundtrack, so more fool me.  I was disappointed that none of the surviving Beatles were interviewed, and George Martin regurgitated details for the ten thousandth time (and I can't take him seriously since the BBC Big Train spoof). That said, most of the interviewees were vastly interesting and informative. But surely they could have got Paul or Richard to reminisce a bit?
B00007EL92|5.0|This album is a classic,it gets better everytime i hear it.Songs like Hound Dog and A Fool Such As I (an outtake, but i like it better) have never sounded better from the Mono tracks. From the stereo side Burning Love may have increased as a favorite from this compilation and Suspicious Minds,In The Ghetto,His Latest Flame and Surrender really ring out like they were recorded yesterday and this is the cd i can't wait to here the DvD, the only bad thing about about this compilation is that Little Sister and a few others were not included...A must for any music fan, even if your not an Elvis fan. p/s the Mono tracks are in Surround sound on the DvD because of a new technic devised by the restoration team on the project and A Little less Conversation is supposedly really Fantastic from the reviews i have read on The DvD.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|Winner of 4 Oscars, this lavish, sumptous film captures debauched and bloody 18th century Europe completely and evocatively. Every shot is like a Gainsborough painting come to life and every character is a dissolute rake, gambler... just waiting to be swept away by the wave of revolutions about to hit Europe. Personally i didn't find the film cold or chilly, I think it is just correct and appropriate for the era. There are some parts of it which are very funny and it is also very outrageous and uninhibited. Excellent film.
B00005JKNF|5.0|The collector's edition DVD of Gosford Park provides comments by Altman and writer, Julian Fellowes as well as documentary on filming the film, out takes and filmography data.  Fellowes comments, however, are wonderful insight to the history of English country house weekends, the arrogance of classism in British social history, as well as providing delightful rememberances of the author's own relations from whom he drew heavily developing his characters.<br />This is a film of seamless performances from every actor and underscores the strength of theatrical training in the British system over Hollywood's studio celebrity system.  A little bit Agetha Christie, but not really, the story of a dismal weekend in the country is made all the better by Altman's direction, or ability to direct without interference in his actor's performances.  <br />Stellar performances include Maggie Smith (Prime of Miss Jean Brody), delightful as the Countess without a pot to p*#s in, Michael Gambon (The Singing Detective), the victim of greedy in-laws and dog-haters, Jeremy Northam as Ivor Novello delivers blissful musical entertainment to guests and audience alike, Emily Watson (Metroland) demonstrates why she is one of the best young actors working today, and Helen Mirren and Clive Owen are mysterious players in the upstairs-downstairs dilemma.  The depth of cast talent is akin to an archaeology dig, it just keeps getting better as time passes.<br />Gosford Park is a film that makes film watching a pleasure.  In the hands of excellent players, a director who knows how to stage shots, and with a screen play that is both witty and informed, the audience can't loose.  This is one of the best films of the year, it should be included in every film buff's library.
B00007E8V4|5.0|these guys have picked up where rage left off, only with a totally different style than any band in the world today.  these guys are original.  though i had extremely high expectations for the follow up of toxicity (which was my most listened to cd last year), soad surpassed those expectations.  <br />the opening track is a bit silly, but makes its point about how &quot;advertising's got you on the run&quot;, which i totally understand.  then the single innervision busts out with the system that your used to, bringing booming guitar and drums, along with that arabian feel.  some highlights include the track boom, you can feel how passionate they are about the negative aspects of military and war.  moving up to mr. jack, this is probably my favorite track at the moment.  this song builds and builds with beautiful screaming harmonies at the end that really hit you. you have to check that whole song out.  <br />one more thing i like about this album is the fact that it is continuous.  it sounds less like a collection of songs, and more like a complete album.  at times it's hard to tell whether the songs are switching tracks, or are in fact still the same song.  <br />i can not recommend an album more highly at the moment.
B00003CY6M|2.0|I was very disappointed by this film.   I am a big fan of John Cusak and Jeremy Piven.  They usually make good choices with the scripts they do, and give you hearfelt performances.   This film is a major exception.   Cusak seems to sleepwalk through the film, barely being there.  He looked very tired and bored, as was I.       It starts with an interesting premise but doesn't really go anywhere with it.  Repetitive would be a good word to describe it. It's just scene-after-scene of \\"Oh look, destiny can be such a strange and funny thing, can't it?!\\" moments.  And most of the moments are dull.  It could've gone somewhere, but it didn't.     This was my first time seeing Kate Beckinsale, and I hope it's my last.  She was very wooden and sounded like she was reading the script outloud for the first time everytime she spoke.   Jeremy Piven was OK, but wasn't given much to work with.   The only highpoint of the movie were the scenes with Eugene Levy in them.   He stole the movie, and is the only reason I give the film 2 stars.   The DVD extras aren't any better.  Some of the \\"deleted\\" scenes are more like alternative versions of the same boring scenes that made the movie.  Delete them all I say!    Don't waste your money on this film, beyond a rental if you're curious.   \\"America's Sweethearts\\", with John Cusak that came out at the same time is slightly better.   Or better yet, for your John Cusak fix, watch or rewatch: \\"Say Anything\\", \\"High Fidelty\\", \\"Better Off Dead\\", \\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\", \\"the Grifters\\", or wait for his new film \\"School of Rock\\" with Jack Black.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is oddly compelling.  It's like Neil Young got stoned while watching the Powerpuff Girls and started channeling Pink Floyd.  Even if you're not a fan of NY or PF, you might like this set.  It'll become one of those oddball things in your collection that you will listen to nonstop for about a month, but then thereafter pull out about once a month and smile again about what a weird, totally unique piece of tunage it is.
6304936303|4.0|Chalk this one up to another case of \\"There's nothing Bruce Willis Can't Do\\".  <br />Willis is Hallenbeck, a disgraced former bodyguard of a Senator who's into S&M when he's not taking bribes from corrupt businessmen.  (Willis intervened when one of the Senator's sessions went too far.)  Not quite divorced, Hellenbeck lives in his car when he's not working as a private investigator.  Nothing goes right for our hero whose first line of dialog is to himself in the mirror: \\"Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. You're gonna lose.\\"  To highlight the utter lowliness of his position, Hellenbeck's latest job comes from the man sleeping with his wife (and may force Hellenbeck to save the life of the creep of a senator who ruined it to begin with).  Asked to safeguard a stripper, Hellenbeck hooks up with her boyfriend, ex-NFL pro Jimmy Dix (Wayons).  Like Hellenbeck, Dix is also disgraced, but can at least boast of the cash to afford, and a girlfriend played by Halle Berry.  Dix's girlfriend is under fire because she has evidence that could implicate both the owner of the football team that kicked Jimmy off, and the Senator who ruined Hellenbeck's career.  Unable to save Dix's lover, they stumble on the tape and now are forced to face an army of foul-mouthed gunmen who seem to have every resource on their side.<br />Okay, at this point, you're probably thinking that this is another \\"stupid LA movie\\" ala \\"Ford Fairlane\\".  Instead, this is probably the most enjoyable \\"stupid LA movie\\" to come out of Hollywood in the 1990's.  Though touching on corruption in politics and pro-sports, \\"Last Boyscout\\" knows to play it for fun.  There's a lot of gun play, but most of the time, our heros survive on bad language alone.  Cursing their way out of being shot or otherwise murdered, Willis's and Wayons's mouths are alone more dangerous than any weapon.  The action sequences aren't that memorable, and the bad guys don't develop all that well, but this flick gets enough mileage by pairingWillis and Wayons who are collectively shot, stabbed, thrown off highways or otherwise beaten.  Rather than their guns, it's the leads' mouths that should be registered as weapons of mass destruction as they curse at their enemies and even dare them to laugh (witness Willis telling fat-wife jokes to the man about to kill him).  This is the perfect flick for watching while drunk.
B00006690G|5.0|this cd is eminems best cd yet. he's one of the only rapper's out there rapping about whats real, not what hes got and all his money. i definately recommend his album to anyone who likes em, or is just lookin for good flows.
6305524866|4.0|The Hugh Grant-Andie MacDowell relationship is tedious at best -- we're told there's instant chemistry, but I don't feel it, and their rush to the sack leaves me cold.  However, the supporting storylines contain some of the funniest and most moving moments in modern comedy, more than enough to keep me watching, over and over again.  But I keep my finger on the fast-forward button to get past the tiresome parts.
0679722610|4.0|This is a hard tale of a hard guy, a nameless private detective, who arrives in the western mining town of Personville (called &quot;Poisonville&quot; by many of its criminal denizens who hail from points east) to meet a client . . . only to learn that the client has been murdered on the very night of their scheduled meeting. The client was the son of the town's wealthiest citizen, an aging tycoon who, to beat back the unionization of the miners he employs, has invited all manner of gangsters and hard cases into town to break the unions.<br />But, in breaking them for him, the gangsters have moved in for good and taken over running things, setting up their own rackets, controlling the police and sucking the old man into their schemes since they have so much &quot;on him.&quot; The detective (known only as the Continental operative throughout) approaches the tycoon about the murder of his son and soon conceives the notion of cleaning the place up, whether the old man wants him to or not. Playing the various sides off against one another, the detective embarks on a cold-hearted, calculated odyssey to win the confidence of one gangster after another, in order to turn each against the other (shades of Yojimbo!).<br />In the process, the detective, himself, gets drawn into the bloody maelstrom he has created through his various betrayals until, sinking into the same moral morass as all the others, he finds himself waist deep in murder with only the shakiest of alibis and a profound sense of his own moral surrender. The body count mounts as one gangster after another is betrayed by our apparently amoral &quot;Continental op&quot;, until the very pegs on which the town has been hung are shaken loose.<br />The real mystery here is less who killed the detective's original client than who killed the detective's own victim . . . and how will he manage to extricate himself from the violent and bloody depths he has plunged the town of Poisonville, and himself, into. Lots of blackmail and mayhem and bloodshed here and a real sense of lost moral bearings. This detective, for all his good intentions seems no better, in many ways, than the criminal element he has set out to undermine.<br />In the end he does pull himself out of the fire and manages to see the job through, but we are left with a clear sense of amorality that makes this nameless detective little better than the crooks he has overthrown. In fact some of them, like Whisper Thaler, seem a hell of a lot more honorable . . . and likeable.<br />SWMkmail and mayhem and bloodshed here and a real sense of lost moral bearings.

B00005M91K|5.0|A visually stunning, beautiful sounding and very moving film about humanity, nature, religion and culture, and how they all interact.   Slow, methodical, and rewarding. <BR> <BR>   It is important to note that this film is not an imiation of \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" nor is it plagiarism, as it is sometimes labeled.  Director Ron Fricke was the cinematographer, picture editor and co-writer of \\"Koyaanisqatsi,\\" and when that film was completed, Fricke was disappointed with how negative the message of it was, so he set out on his own to create a film the would show positive images as well as negative ones, trying to relate a more coprehensive and objective view of man's effect on this planet.<br />   Both films are well worth the effort of seeing.  (Especially on a big screen if you ever get the chance.)
B00005JLWL|5.0|Its too bad it didnt do well in the box office.  The movie disserved to rank top for at lest a few weeks.  Lets just put it this way if you liked the matrix....get rdy for something that blows it out of the water into tiny little pieces.  By far the best movie this year, and one of my favorite movies of all time.
6302878527|2.0|This was clearly an experiment in teaming up the long-established (and ever-charming) Audrey Hepburn with up-and-coming British star Albert Finney, who never did quite go on to become the matinee idol some had hoped, despite getting a good headstart with Tom Jones (1965). Here, however, the match is awkward, and not helped by a fairly witless script and an overall lack of coherence. The thin plot is terribly structured, meandering here and there at a deathly pace, and ending up nowhere in particular.<br />The combination seemed great: Donen directing Hepburn with a snazzy score by easy listening giant Henry Mancini; It was never meant to be, however. This reviewer was left sorely disappointed, wondering where the last two hours of his life had vanished to.
B00006LLNU|2.0|Maybe I'm showing my age but Sigur Ros aren't breaking new ground here. Rather,they're clearly pinching from a treasure chest of other artists. Most evident: Red House Painters,Dif Juz and This Mortal Coil to name a few from the band roster of the 4AD label. 4AD had been putting out this type of atmospheric wallpaper almost 20 years before Sigur Ros ever came onto the scene. It's interesting to hear NPR and Rolling Stone christen Sigur Ros under the rubric of \\"post-rock\\"when the music they make would've been considered simply \\"goth\\"not even less than 5 years ago.Dare I say,Sigur Ros's latest CD doesn't pack nearly as much instrumental punch as,say,Dead Can Dance,Piano Magic or Scorn.  It's not bad as background music,I'll give it that much. Still, it's not nearly as engaging as the blatantly evident influences they acquire their sound from. If you simply MUST have this CD, I'd recommend NOT paying [money] and seeing about getting a used copy.
6302424887|4.0|I remember the controversy attending the release of this film, which focused on two things: the nudity, which struck some reviewers as a gratuitous imposition by the producer, Hugh Hefner (although the famous nude sleepwalking scene was in the Polanski-Tynan script well before Playboy's involvement in the picture), and the gobbets of blood, which to some seemed a needless genuflection to the Bonnie and Clyde-Wild Bunch trend toward gore in action cinema. Thirty years later, these controversies seems silly. This is simply an extremely well-staged and filmed version of a play everyone knows, which has been reconceived by Roman Polanski (when he was still hot) for film and loaded with genuinely cinematic values--from the dramatic Welsh locations to interesting camera movement and jump-cut editing to the (overdone) use of voice-overs in the drama's many soliloquies.<br />As for the criticisms of the early 1970s, Macbeth is, after all, a play with a substantial sexual undertow, and even when staged in the 17th century, it was very, very bloody. The language cries \\"blood!\\" and if the production doesn't show it, the words seem false. What Polanski does, of course, is to show things, with those freshets of blood for emphasis, that the Bard transacted off stage. Jon Finch, who American audiences might know best from Hitchcock's Frenzy, and Francesca Annis, never more beautiful, compel attention as youthful Laird and Lady. Remember that the Macbeths are Shakespeare's most happily married couple: based on these performances, I can believe this. The adaptation is very straightforward and runs some 2 hours and 20 minutes; as Macbeth is one of the shortest plays in the Shakespearean oeuvre, you get a lot of Bard for the Buck; most of it is there--I didn't do a simultaneous textual comparison--albeit in truncated form from time to time.<br />If I were rating this film on the basis of performances and production alone, I'd give it a straight five. It is stunning and, to my mind, among the handful of genuinely compelling Shakespeare films, along with Branagh's Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing and both Olivier's and McKellen's Richard III. (I also love Derek Jacobi's Hamlet in the BBC series.) Polanski makes uncommonly sensible directorial choices, with two exceptions: the climactic duel between Macbeth and Macduff goes on entirely, even comically, too long (although the preceding scenes--in which Macbeth the Invincible strides through the army of his foes like Sauron in the Battle for Middle Earth--and the following--when Macbeth's severed head makes an eerie, even hallucinogenic (yes, this was the '70s) progression though the Dunsinane courtyard on its way to the inevitable pike--are stunningly mounted. And the excessive use of voice-over consigns many of Macbeth's greatest speeches to \\"thought\\"--fine, of course, soliloquy does indeed represent \\"thought,\\" and film is the medium that can create the requisite illusion--but I, for one, nevertheless longed to see and hear these immortal words properly \\"acted\\" and intoned with lips a-flapping.<br />I dock the VHS version a star for its muffled sound--cinematic or no, Shakespeare is nothing without the glorious language--and would recommend, sight unseen and sound unheard, the DVD version, which has absolutely no extras to commend itself but must have clearer sound and is in full widescreen, to boot, making it therefore by definition preferable to the VHS (unless, like me, you were able to cop a VHS bargain).among the handful of genuinely compelling Shakespeare films, along with Branagh's Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing and both Olivier's and McKellen's Richard III.

And the excessive use of voice-over consigns many of Macbeth's greatest speeches to \\"thought\\"--fine, of course, soliloquy does indeed represent \\"thought,\\" and film is the medium that can create the requisite illusion--but I, for one, nevertheless longed to see and hear these immortal words properly \\"acted\\" and intoned with lips a-flapping. <br />I dock the VHS version a star for its muffled sound--cinematic or no, Shakespeare is nothing without the glorious language--and would recommend, sight unseen and sound unheard, the DVD version, which has absolutely no extras to commend itself but must have clearer sound and is in full widescreen, to boot, making it therefore by definition preferable to the VHS (unless, like me, you were able to cop a VHS bargain).

0375823360|2.0|A definite read for only the most callused anti-Christian bigot. It is unfortunate that this author's adequate skill at story telling is lost on such a blatant bigot. His intolerant views are forced into this story unnecessarily. The bigotry adds nothing needful to the plot. Even at the point when he kills God it is so anticlimactic you barely noticed that it has occured. The story could easily have been told without his trite narrow-minded views clouding an otherwise good story.
0684833395|5.0|Heller's Catch 22 is the funniest book I have ever read, but it is also a surprisingly tragic story.<br />The plot (about a bombardier named Yossarian who wishes desperately to find a way out of fighting in WWII) is not truly concrete, and the entire book is mostly a study in character.  The conflicts of John Yossarian's various friends and foes are explored, and the ineffectiveness of bureaucracy is mercilessly satirized.  Here's an example of the trademark wit and absurdity that characterizes Catch 22:<br />\\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly.<BR>\\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried.<BR>\\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked.<BR>\\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\"<BR>\\"And what difference does that make?\\"<br />A great and memorable book, I highly recommend it.

As soon as it is out in hardback, I will be buying it.  <br />This book lives up to everything I hoped it would be.  It is a fluid continuation of her Farseer trilogy.  Reading the Farseer trilogy is almost a must to get the full dynamics of the emotion Hobb weaves in this book.  I honestly tried to &quot;ration&quot; this read.  I simply could not do it.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Bought the CD just because I liked &quot;Dirrty&quot; and was very curious about that LP. I always thought of Christina that she is Britney Spears singer type but with better voice. Now I think that she's a great soul and R&amp;B artist, with very original style and of course a great voice. Songs like &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; with Lil' Kim, &quot;Impossible&quot; with Alicia Keys, &quot;Dirrty&quot; with Redman, &quot;Singing My Song&quot; and &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot; are just THE BEST. Ballad &quot;Beautiful&quot; is the most beautiful I ever heard.<BR>I recommend this CD for anyone who likes Christina and for everyone who like good soul and R&amp;B music!
B0000640VO|5.0|&quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm.  There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was.  All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand.  The most important thing to know is that &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;).  I feel about this film the way I did about &quot;Memento,&quot; where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle).  However, I think the audience that would enjoy &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; is considerably wider than those who would cotton to &quot;Memento&quot; (which was a quirky little film).<br />So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see &quot;Am&eacute;lie.&quot;  Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider &quot;spoilers,&quot; you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).<br />I find it interesting that the film's French title &quot;Le Fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain&quot; was reduced to just &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot; for American consumption.  Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film.  One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).<br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Am&eacute;lie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do.  We then begin 48 hours in which d'Am&eacute;lie's life is changed.  Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor.  Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny.  The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?<br />The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world.  Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy.  But as long as Am&eacute;lie lives happily ever after we are content.  I pity the person who does not fall in love with this film.that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).  <br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Amélie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do.

Trujillo and Bordin are not to blame, they're just employees of Ozzy.
B00005JLRR|2.0|It has been twenty-three years since the first Star Trek film was released, and its most stylish villains - the Romulans - finally have their turn. It's fitting that John Logan (one of the screenwriters of Gladiator) wrote this installment - albeit with some meddling by Brent Spiner.<br />  Unfortunately, as with so much recent Star Trek fare, the execution is earnest but poor; production design is insipid, the vistas generally colorless, editing is awkward. Spiner has also pulled a Sigourney Weaver - using his input to give himself a heroic sendoff.<br />  Compared to Star Wars, one expects some cheapness in Star Trek visuals, yet painted backdrops and redressed sets just don't meet today's standards.<br />  Don't expect to see Riker's new command, the Titan, either.<br />  Nevertheless, Star Trek loyalists will remember the series' better days, swallow hard, and buy this product.

1400031354|5.0|This second entry in Smith's Botswana-set series picks up right where the wonderful The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency left off. Indeed, the two books are utterly seamless, and it'd be a real shame to read this without reading its predecessor first. The book picks up with the engagement of \\"traditionally built\\" Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's sole woman detective, to local master mechanic Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. While the structure is the same as the first booka missing son as the central running mystery, and some smaller cases interspersedthe new couple's relationship is the real focus.<br />So, while Precious is asked by an American woman to find out what happened to her son, who disappeared from a commune ten years previously, she must also negotiate the pitfalls of setting up house with Mr. Matekoni, the acquisition of an engagement ring, and the dastardly schemes of Mr. Matekoni's nasty housekeeper, and the unexpected addition of two foster children to her household. All of which she does with her keen sense of human nature and wisdom. Her secretary/typist is also given increased attention, allowed to take on the case of a cheating wife all by herself.<br />Built into the stories are ruminations of the tensions between modernity and traditional values. There are a number of passages that attempt to capture the essence of Africa, and how that noble vision is under constant assault by greed, corruption, and power. The adventures of Precious and her cohort are a warm antidote to the often depressing news that dominates coverage of Africa in the West. Smith writes in a delightfully fluid and simple prose with pacing that makes the book quite difficult to put down. The series thankfully continues with Morality for Beautiful Girls and The Kalahari Typing School For Men, with further volumes to follow, one hopes.
0375414053|5.0|I can already imagine the movie version of I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT.  Renee Zellwiger will be perfectly cast in the lead role.  This book is funny, brilliant, exciting, and enjoyable.  You have to like Kate Reddy and you have to laugh and commiserate with her as she faces all the problems of a talented executive as well as those of a wife and mother who is losing it fast. Even though this is the story of a working mom (mum), you will like this even if you aren't.  My days of small children are long gone, but I still enjoyed this tremendously.<br />There's nothing particularly deep about this book.  It's just good entertainment.  If you have a few days off, a long week-end at the beach, or just want something to fill the time between important matters, pick this one up.  It's quick and easy and will keep your interest.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Without being redundant, I too thought this was a great series, perhaps the overall best depiction of WW2 that's ever been filmed.  Of course, in a 10 hour mini-series, the producers and directors have the opportunity ot go into much more detail in terms of character development and to be more faithful to the book than in a 2 or 3 hour movie, which makes this production a must have for war/history buffs.<br />The length of this production gives the viewer a much better feel for the boredom/terror of war, and a better feeling of what is was really like to be in the 101st.  Two of the latter episodes (7 and 9 I think) were particularly good, and although just as important to the telling of the whole story, I could have done with less time spent on the training in episode 1.  It took me two viewings to really be clear on who was who, since of course they all have uniforms and sometimes it was difficult to remember the specific soldiers.  However, I suppose that is how it really was, especially when the replacements started arriving.<br />This is the kind of DVD I will watch many times, and since Ambrose was a actively involved in the production, it is true to the book.  A must buy!
B00005JLRR|4.0|It's about friggin' time!  After 20 years and 7 mediocre films in the series, Trek FINALLY delivers the goods!  Undeniably the best of the Next Generation era films and arguable the best one since Khan,  Screenwriter John Logan and Director Stuart Baird are unequivocally the best thing to happen to Trek since Nicholas Meyer was brought into the fold.  The result is an entertaining installment that finally elevates the cast of TNG from the television series and solidifies their position to feature film status.  My biggest complaint of the post-classic Trek films is that they have always come off as 2 hour long episodes of the television series, and not even the best episodes of the show at that.  There have been much better episodes of the series that should have been made into theatrical films like \\"All Good Things\\" or \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\".  Until \\"Nemesis\\" came along, the Berman-era films have failed to distinguish themselves as theatrical contenders.<br /><br />Although the plot of Nemesis may seem a bit like a \\"clone\\" of Wrath of Khan, it definitely has the chemistry to make it an enjoyable and entertaining [copy].  For instance, the scene where a crippled Enterprise backs away from the Scimitar to escape the \\"Doomsday\\" weapon (see Genesis Device), you can practically hear the sinister Shinzon uttering \\"No Picard, you can't get away!\\"  The references to Khan are unmistakable, but scribe John Logan knows his audience and he knows exactly what they want to see and he knows these characters and injects the franchise with the right dosage of action and humor to resuscitate life into the dying franchise and keep the crew of the good ship Enterprise trekkin' a bit longer.<br /><br />As always, Patrick Stewart delivers a first class performance with Shakespearean benediction no matter how bland the script or dialogue may be.  Here, Picard has truly met his match in the form of a clone of himself.  This clone is younger and more agressive and mirrors his younger self in every flawed detail.  The whole time I kept thinking of the brilliant episode \\"Tapestry\\" where Q sends Jean-Luc back to change the mistakes of his past and we meet that arrogant and brash younger version.  Here, Shinzon is literally an example of Youth versus Wisdom and the themes are remakably explored between these two diametrical characters.  Khan he is not, but Tom Hardy delivers a diabolical performance as the calculating villain.  I still would like to have seen Shinzon complete the blood transfusion and jump 30 years in age in which we would have seen Patrick Stewart playing opposing roles against himself but perhaps that would have been too much like the classic Trek episode \\"The Enemy Within.\\"<br /><br />The supporting cast are all present and (somewhat) accounted for.  Gates McFadden is basically \\"On Call\\" as Dr. Beverly Crusher making the house calls as needed.  As usual, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi serves basically one function, that of a psychic Ouija Board, but her engagement scene to William Riker was befitting.  Levar Burton once again holds the ship together as Chief Engineer Geordi LaForge delivering all of the technobabble and suffering from Scotty Syndrome.  As for the loveable Klingon warrior, Mr. Worf, it seems Michael Dorn is unfairly given the smallest part to play in this film.  During the film's climax, he seems to disappear from sight while Jonathan Frakes' Potsy-looking (see Anson Williams from Happy Days) Riker is manhandling the Reman Viceroy (Ron Pearlman) down a laundry chute while Jean-Luc Picard is fighting with (himself) and the Enterprise is taking a pummeling.  One must assume that either Worf is still too hung over from the Romulan Ale served at Riker and Troi's reception, or that he must be curled up in Ten Forward lounge with a bottle of Saurian Brandy getting drunk with Guinan.  I find it amusing that he only shows up again at the end for the free booze in the Captain's Ready Room during the toast to \\"absent friends.\\"I'm surprised that they didn't cut back to Worf during the corridor firefight with the Reman thugs.  I would love to have seen him break out the Bat'Leh and take them out in honorable Klingon fashion as it would have provided another element of suspense.<br /><br />Brent Spiner reprises his role as the charming android Data and once again explores his humanity through the presence of a doppleganger brother in the form of the childlike B4.

Perhaps B4 was designed with the intention of giving Spiner an oportunity to explore new facets of his character having reached a redundant impasse with the development of his role Data.<br /><br />It is a shame that it took them 4 films with this exceptional cast before everything finally clicked on what may be the last film to feature the TNG crew although the door has been left open for possibly another voyage.

B00005JL96|5.0|WOW! - This was an awesome DVD!  An \\"evil genius\\" in a faraway galaxy creates a genetically modified creature that has only one goal in life - to destroy.  The creature escapes and crashes on Earth, where he finds his way into the home of a little Hawaiian girl.  Lilo and her sister Nani are in some trouble as it is and Stitch's destructive nature is not helping matters.  A social worker is trying to take Lilo from her sister's care and is not happy with the addition of Stitch to the family.  To make matters worse, aliens have been sent to recapture Stitch.  The little monster eventually is able to overcome his genetic programming and learn to love his Hawaiian friends while surfing (great scene).<br />The animation and music are one-of-a-kind.  Lilo is adorable and the hula dancing is incredibly lifelike.  The songs, with backup by a children's choir, are in Hawaiian and help to complete the effect.  Tia Carrere even voices the character of Nani.<br />The extra features kept me laughing.  You can Stitch replacing several characters throughout Disney history, such as Lady in the familiar spaghetti scene from \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" or Simba in the \\"Lion King\\".  There are featurettes on the wonderful children's choir that sang in the movie, and how the animators drew the hula dance so well.  A mini-encyclopedia on the state of Hawaii and a trivia game are also nice touches.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Great entertainment in an original story that is appropriate for the 21-st century.  There is no white, middle-class family.  Instead, a \\"broken family\\" with a social worker (and a few aliens).  The laughs keep coming and the music and animation is beautiful.  The artists obviously had some fun with the extra features, and you will too!
6300184064|4.0|People who will like Brazil will probably love it. It's in the vain of movies like Kafka, 12 Monkeys, 1984, and other literary flicks based on alienation, governmental totalitarianism, adventure/fantasy. Brazil may stand out for being more beautiful and comic than the others. It's really a damn funny satire even when it's dealing with the major fear themes of the 20th century: the loss of communication, love and especially freedom. Of course, we've all seen this sort of thing before, and director Terry Gilliam gets pretty caried away sometimes with how GREAT he seems to think the movie is, which can cause the veiwer's interest to flag a bit. Still, I didn't start to get tired of it till the 4th time I saw it. So that's pretty good...
0790737345|1.0|I don't know if this should be called a &quot;remake&quot; or just a crass, dumbed down, Americanized version of the Classic 1987 German film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, directed by Wim Wenders.<br />This movie lacks everything that made &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; a classic and an international hit; depth, intelligence, great cinematography, imaginative, thought-provoking and powerful, yet understated acting.<br />Against my better judgement, I saw this movie out of curiosity, depsite the scathing reviews, because I was so impressed by Wings...  Even as a stand alone, without comparing it to the vastly superior Wenders film, this movie is typical Hollywood at it's worst, a contrived story, weakly written and acted, and even though not a happy ending, it cheaply and lamely attempts to tug at ones heart strings with sappy ending.<br />I wouldn't recommend &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; to anyone who liked &quot;City of Angels&quot;.  The Wenders film would not be appreciated by anyone who enjoyed this waste of time and money.  This was a movie for the masses, and a very bad one at that.
B0000019PA|5.0|Perhaps not. But it is truly incredible. I haven't listened to a CD this much in a long time. In fact, I hid it from myself for about 2 weeks because I was listening to it so much I was afraid I would get sick of it. Now I've just listened to it again, and I'm far from sick of it.<br />I'm afraid I won't be able to explain exactly what it is that about this CD that speaks to me so loudly and clearly. It is, quite simply, a work of art. There isn't one song that stands out as better than any of the others, nor is there one song that isn't quite as good as the others.<br />It seems that just about every emotion you can experience is here at one point or another: happiness, sadness, loneliness, love, joy, pain, suffering. Some songs are quiet; others are full of energy. At times it sounds like a funeral dirge; sometimes it's all you can do to sit still.<br />And then there are the lyrics. I don't think I've ever heard lyrics that have been so creative, so poetic, so capable of conjuring up so many images.<br />But music is much like any of the visual arts where a picture is worth a thousand words. I could go on all day about this CD, but in the end, you just have to hear it for yourself.<br />I, for one, have never heard anything quite like it.

B00006G8O1|5.0|Don't know where I was when this came out (probably avoiding Hollywood movies in general), but I'm glad I finally saw it. I had it reccommended to me by several friends and they were right. It's hard to sufficiently praise the risk-taking that the makers were willing to undergo for this movie. It's is very abnormal for such a big budget movie. It has a very convoluted message, and very psychedelic visuals. Not the typical nerd with a computer stuff at all. The characters are dynamic and imperfect and very well rendered. And the tension it creates and maintains throughout is quite impressive. I really just feel like praising this movie endlessly, because it did so many things your average movie won't even consider. I think it's great!
0767830555|5.0|This is a great film, and a terrific example of some of the better film-making of the 1970's.<br />Read what others have to say, I agree.  One thing I would like to add is that I particurlaly enjoyed the bonus material on this DVD, the &quot;documentary&quot; where they interviewed the actors, screenwriter, special effects person and the director.  I found it very insightful, and being a New Yorker, appreciated the tibits of trivia as to where and how certain scenes were filmed.<br />A welcome addition to my small, yet selective collection.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|Actually not a bad teen-oriented scary movie.  Not too self-referential or inside-jokey, and creepy without too much explicit gore.  A lot of the scariness just plays off of our innate dreads and loathings; our attention is also held fast by endless examples of ill-advised &quot;stupid&quot; behavior and various plot holes.  A pleasantly unresolved, but rather decisive ending.  Bring on the sequel!
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first heard Tool's song 'sober' off their album \\"undertoe\\" I fell in love! Never before have I heard something so angst ridden, so melodic, so powerful, and so emotional in my whole life. Maynard's voice in this album is full of emotion and power and beauty, in my opinion Maynard may have the most beautiful voice in heavy metal today, hands-down!<br />A rare masterpiece of music, something to put next to your bethoven and mozart records as well, seriously!
B00007AJKI|5.0|I could write a lot about this movie, but that would be silly. This movie demonstrates how words can only express so much. A picture is worth a thousand, after all. Waking Life uses very cool painted on film animation to enhance some sophisticated talk on all kinds of subjects. The visuals are stunning and speak so much more profoundly than my lousy review ever could. More people should see this movie. It's really very good.

B0000633T6|3.0|Robert Redford and Brad Pitt try to out-blonde and out-handsome each other in this muddled spy thriller.  Did someone cut out the twenty minutes during which the plot makes sense and we care at all about any of the characters?  Guess so.
B00000ILBK|5.0|This movie broke the odd numbered curse in my opinion.  I was always disappointed in the first one. The third one was ok except for the supporting actor's C-List acting. The fifth one ... and they really should have waited till the strike was over to film it. And the seventh one was the best uptil now except for Kirk's death which was not fitting in my opinion. Star Trek Insurrection is where the curse ends for me.  This is a needed addition for the genre. The scene where Data, Worf, and Picard are singing is hilarious and a classic moment in all the films. I don't blame Worf for not wanting to sing! <br />    Also the struggle with upkeeping the morals of the Federation's Prime Directive was intriguing too.  The deeper meaning which was found in most of the episodes of the series is found here in a major way.  This movie is also big after Nemesis because it shows Data still wondering about being human and helps build the climax for the next movie where he makes the ultimate sacrifice.  And Picard 2.0, a term I made up for his new found action hero inside him, has a love story and is sort of like Moses leading all those people. All in all, a great addition for the Star Trek fan who wants to see more about the characters and less gore.  I'm not one of them! Even so a great addition to the genre and I still give it 5 stars. Oh and go see Nemesis for the love of Roddenberry if you haven't by now!
B000021YQV|5.0|I have been a System fan since the release of their first album.  I had never heard anything quite like it.  They clearly have their own sound and a positive, informative agenda.  Their first release had a very raw sound so it did take me a while to warm up to the polished, perfect metal sound Toxicity has.  However, once I let it grow on me, I couldn't take it out of my cd player.  It is clearly one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It is intense and exhilarating from start to finish.  The only bad thing I would say is that I am not sure how System of a Down will ever follow up this album with something that equals the ingeniousness of Toxicity.
0553381709|5.0|This book has characters and a plot that are both complex and developing.  But there are two things I would like to warn anyone who wants to buy this book and the two books before it about.  Firstly the religions in this book are confusing and generally evil.  They really screwed with my head.  I think that the author since the first book is trying to slowly cause readers to understand his revelation about religion.  I don't believe that his concluding revelation will be that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.<br />Secondly there are about ten very explicit sexual scenes in this book. I think they are used to help readers better understand the cultures of the people in this book and they do that well, but they are really disgusting and bizarre.   I almost feel like not recommending the book because of them.  Sex in books one and two are the same as I've described this third book as being.<br />Outside of sexual and spiritual stuff I think that this is a great book to read.  It has lots of plots, and cultures, and tons of characters.  Each chapter is told from the perspective of a major character and the characters are spread out to many different places.  I am giving the book five stars because I think these other aspects of it are so awesome and sex and religion are a matter of taste.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|A pretty cool is-this-real-or-isn't-this? horror-ish art film, which mixes oh-god-what-happened-to-our-little-baby parental angst and \\"Kids\\"-style teenage nihilism. James Gyllenhaal -- who may be the Bizarro Worl version of Toby McGuire -- is fascinating to watch, yet completely convincing as one of those slow-eyed, remotely psychotic young guys that you're amazed is able to get a date at all. The ending is satisfyingly head-trippy, with some reality-bending plot twists that fans of \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" may appreciate. Worth checking out!
B00005QB9A|5.0|I, too, first saw the movie on IFC (one of my favorite channels) but only caught the 2nd half of it. The next day I came back home praying that IFC would show it again, and they did! What can I tell you, I got hooked. I still haven't returned the rental DVD (2nd week now). Needless to say, I'm just about to order the uncut, Italian version. It is a shame that a movie of this caliber is found by accident here in the US, while you get force fed with ads for big budget hollywood b.s. till it starts coming out through your nose.<br />Aside from the director, I think the two men that played a major role to the success of this movie are Ennio Morricone, whose music is simply amazing, and Tim Roth, who shines in this role. As much as I enjoyed the movie, it felt like it could've been made a bit longer. Today I discover that there IS a longer version, yesss! I'll come back to write what I think of it.<br />ciao
B00005MP58|5.0|The movie is an excellent adaptation of the novel.  Pride and Prejudice is a story that you will fall in love with falling in love.  Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) is my favorite character.  The novel have left me to want more........
B00006WUWQ|4.0|Have you ever found yourself awake after many hours of tossing and turning in your bed?  This is great for late nights such as these!!! You will be laughing until you fall over from exhaustion! I loved the 3rd movie - it was 10 times better than the two prior releases. (Although all 3 are wonderful) <BR>The reason I marked this review down was that I found the same three disc pack for $... less at BestBuy.  Great movie, but look elsewhere!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|For some reason, I feel oddly compelled to write something about this excellent album.  I normally do not buy albums like this, but after hearing it I had to.  Her voice is amazing and it shows on this album in a way that it didn't on the last one.  The faster songs have great hooks and the slower songs are, uh, beautiful.  Even though I don't think she writes her own songs, or at least not most of them, I'm inclined to put her in the Avril, Pink, Michelle Branch camp instead of the Britney, Jessica, Mandy camp simply because she is actually an amazing talent.  And, girls, don't be put off by her image.  Dressing to make people hot does not make somebody a tramp.  Great album, great price, and I can't get \\"Infatuation\\" out of my head!
B00005JLRR|3.0|Forget the past and what should be.  If Janeway can have a command title above Picard then the federation is dumb enough to be destroyed by one rogue vessel (in reality it was a suicide misson anyway).  Think of Picard and crew as extreme sports junkies who turn from the safe lane for adventure extraordinaire (but they must do it in a mature 24th century french style) conceding title and ease to those much less qualified.<BR>The ROM-boy can be a youthful adversary against the old codgers; especially since he is dying faster than the film. And his willingness to expend anothers resource to put on incorruptibility was commom enough<BR>The better part of the saga, man's soul cannot be elevated by man himself, was tranfused away by trekkie pablum, sophistry, and fx injections.  My, who could we use as a transcendent, non-human moral guide to provide relational clarity for Jean Luc?<BR>The arch WAS being built and for brief minutes I straightened in my seat flashing on brillance revealed, but alas no capstone could be found.  Our trek was down the hollywood road where many a movie has gone before.
B00003CX95|5.0|Showing how much capable of leadership he is, Mel Gibson is the great Scottish fighter who defends his homeland and people! Through really harsh conditions, after the vicious murder of his beloved woman, Mel manages to lead his people to a great victory against the english and gain back his country's great reputation! A must-see for all patriotic minds and movie fans!
B00005JKG9|4.0|This has the greatest ensemble cast ever assembled since the Godfather.  We get to see Kevin Spacey on his way to superstardom.  And we see why Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin maintained their star quality.<br />The only peeve I have is that the director based the story in New York City, but forgot to make the script changes.  After the burglary, we hear Al Pacino go over his appointments with clients in the Chicagoland suburbs.
B00005JLS0|4.0|If you're in the mood for a chick flick, then this is the one to see- it's predictable, but it's also extremely humorous. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock's talents are nicely showcased here, and Hugh often steals the scenes he's in! Men might get annoyed, though, so gather the girls and go see it. I won't give away the plot (it's yet another twist on the girl meets boy theme), but it definitely didn't reflect the rumors that were circulating about the movie's production (tensions between Hugh and Sandra, etc.) Great way to escape for a few hours!
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath is an amazing author. The fact that she relaesed such an intimate time in her life to be praised or ripped apart by critics shows she was not afraid. The Bell Jar is a well written, informative look into the mind of someone losing all sanity. In fact while you are reading it you will catch yourself questioning your own sanity!
0786868694|5.0|This is a great book. I want to cook every single recipe. All of the recipies work. Nigella has an excellent writing style also. I have over 150 recipe books, but this is one of my firm favourites
B000001GXB|5.0|I am an amateur pianist and organist (having played some form of keyboard instrument for 16 years), and I still cannot imagine how anyone begins to approach works like the Beethoven late sonatas. I've had college professors who I know wouldn't dare to touch them. And so it is a feat of incredible musical accomplishment simply to learn these masterworks. To commit performances of them to the permanent historical record takes an even more Herculean effort (and a self-assurance that borders on egomania). <BR> But to do what Pollini has done here is simply superhuman. Again, I cannot imagine the countless hours spent poring over details that would probably seem minute and insignificant to the rest of us Philistines. But Pollini's efforts (his long recording hiatus in which he had time for such intensive study) have left us with a musical legacy that will not soon be approached by any pianist, even the most accomplished. <BR> Just listen to Charles Rosen's account of the Hammerklavier. Then compare it to Pollini's. Rosen is arguably the world's most intelligent writer on the subject of Western classical music, and he is a great and accomplished pianist in his own right. But he proves in the opening pages of the Hammerklavier that he is incapable of rising to the kind of challenge that Pollini has laid down. You can hear it in the descending line of chords that alternate between right and left hands, especially the offbeat chords in the left hand that create a sense of displacement - Pollini's are absolutely crystal clear, and there is never the slightest sense that either the vertical (read tempo) or horizontal (read melodic arc) aspects of the piece are in danger. With Rosen, one gets the feeling like maybe he's just about to fall apart (listen to the mushiness of the chords and the tempo that momentarily flies forward), when finally the technical demands lessen and Rosen again seizes control. <BR> That is only an example. If I listen to this recording for 100 years, Iam convinced that I will never fully exhaust the musical riches contained therein. One other reviewer had it right- Glenn Gould is the only pianist that can hold a candle to this kind of technical facility (perhaps we may include Richter as well). Every Pollini recording is an event. I suggest you buy them all. They are rare specimens of a reservoir of musical intelligence that runs deeper than we poor sinners could ever fathom.
6301670132|5.0|SAYONARA is a love story. Actually the movie gives us three separate love stories but focuses mainly on just two of them. Major Lloyd Gruver (Marlon Brando) is a West Point graduate who is the son of a general and is engaged to a daughter of another general. Gruver falls in love with Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka), the leading dancer of a prestigious Japanese girl review. Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) is an airman in Gruver's outfit who is in love with Katsumi (Myoshi Umeki), another Japanese girl. Marine Captain Mike Bailey (James Garner) and one of the minor dancers in the troupe make up a third couple.<br />As the story unfolds Gruver and Hana-ogi have to come to grips with their own prejudices while each has to combat the expectations thrust upon them by society because of their respective positions. Both are heavily bound by custom and tradition. On the other hand, Airman Kelly and Katsumi, who are unwavering in their love for each other and their determination to stay together at all costs, have to battle a mountain of red tape and an insensitive bureaucracy. This proves to be no small task. Captain Bailey and his girl friend seem to succeed in taking the whole situation in stride without putting too much pressure on each other.<br />The movie is filled with contrasts. Besides the many differences between the two cultures, there is the sharp differentiation between the lives of military officers and enlisted men. The differences in style between Major Gruver and the more relaxed Captain Bailey are obvious.<br />After earning a reputation as a comedian, Red Buttons was surprisingly convincing in his portrayal of the tragic Kelly. Myoshi Umeki and Miiko Taka both gave strong performances in their Hollywood debuts. Marlon Brando and James Garner did about as well as expected. Ricardo Montalban played a Kabuki dancer. Although he has long been considered a fine actor, surely one of the many fine Japanese actors available at that time would have been a better choice for this role.<br />Both Red Buttons and Myoshi Umeki received Academy Awards as best supporting actor and best supporting actress. The film was nominated for five other Oscars including best picture.
B00005JLFC|5.0|This movie DESERVES to be on DVD!  I watch this movie at least twice a year.  My VHS copy is worn out and I therefore want to move up to a DVD.  I will not buy another VHS.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I thought that \\"Nemesis\\" was perhaps the best Star Trek ever made; the story line was well done, the acting was strong, and the graphics were very good. I walked away very pleased with having seen this newest episode, and expect at least one more with all/most of the same members of the cast. I did see some ideas in this story that originated in other SciFi films, so I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't completely new and original, but I was entertained beyond my expectation. This is a must-see... and one that I think will be viewed many times by me, as Star Trek endures in the hearts of SciFi fans everywhere.
0679601686|5.0|In the whole history of fiction, at least as known to me, there has never been an opening sentence that more fully encapsulated the entire novel than Austen's in this stunning work.  And the succeeding paragraph adds the seasoning, the zest, introducing the setting, the key players, the theme more fully than most novels do in their hundreds of pages. I suggest that no civilized person can read these without a smile and a committment to finish the piece.
B00005JLRR|3.0|STAR TREK NEMESIS is the big 1-0 for the Trek movie francise.  Past history would show that the even numbered films are the better of the bunch.  This one is better then the other odd number films of the bunch, but not by much (Hence the title of this review).  The cast wanted some time off so that they could pursue other interests.  Time away hasn't diminshed the casts appeal but something in the movies was lost in the absence as this movie doesn't feel so much of a Star Trek movie but more of some snazzed up sci fi action blast.<br />  The story does focus on the Romulans, who short of a few appearances in the movies, never got their just due as the villians in a film.  Thats different here.  The Romulans are itching for a conquest of Federation space and a mysterious new Leader has made the promise of an assault under a guise of peace talks with the Federation.  Picard and the Enterprise are sent to Romulus to talk, but it's all a trap.  The crew learns that the leader, Shinzon has constructed a radiaiton weapon which is capable of encompasing any area he wishes, even a planet.  While Picard races home to join the fleet, Shinzon follows to stop him.  What follows is a space battle to beat just about any seen in a Trek show or Feature (Yes it even beats the one seen in movie VI).  Sacrifices are made, The Enterprise takes a tremendous beating, new friends will arive, and some move on.  This will definitly have a change on the course of the Next Generation crew in the future.<br />  Hey, I made it sound good didn't I?  So why not a better rating then the three stars?  Well it's all about style.  Take for instance when Picard lands on a planet in the ARGO, a nifty Starfleet jeep (First time anything with wheels ever shown in Trek), after finding the pieces of a puzzle, the crew is attacked and chased by other jeeps in what is something that could be seen in almost any other action film.  Also, if you saw FIRST CONTACT, you saw that the ship has an armory for the weapons, here the phasers are revealed from rotating panals in a wall, it reminded me of Batman.  Another minor nuonce is the naming schemes of the enemy vehicles.  A Scorpion Fighter and the Scimatar cruiser aren't very Romulan sounding are they?  Maybe for the Federation they would be.  Finally, the psychic attack that Troi recieves, is more silly then scary, sorry but it was.<br />  This movie didn't make me challenge my taste for my favorite trek movie like others have.  Maybe if Frakes were put back in charge of directing things will be better in the future (if theres another film, Patrick Stewart has allueded in many interviews that it might not be the last one).  The director here wasn't bad, but Frakes having been a member of the whole francize has a better grasp on the material.  Like I said before, it's not bad, but it certainly didn't measure up to previous Trek movies.  If your a big fan, of course go and see it, a more casual fan should consider waiting for a second run theater or the rental market.r the weapons, here the phasers are revealed from rotating panals in a wall, it reminded me of Batman.

B00005JLRR|4.0|Gene Roddenberry must be rolling in his urn.<br />Has the world of Star Trek lost its focus?  Absolutely.  Everything made with the tital \\"Star Trek\\" since Mr. Roddenberry's death has been about Hi-Tech Dictatorships and War.  It's constant violence and cliche-ed (sp?) battle.  Even the newest member into the Star Trek world: Nemesis, is just a re-write of STII:TWOK.<br />Is it funny?  Very.  Does it have a lot of good action?  Definitely.  Is it sad what happens to some of the characters?  *Sniff*  Yup.  Does it follow the Star Trek focus?  Barely.<br />I give it a high mark because of the great space battles and funny and/or sad character interaction.  But it does have a few boring parts, and at times it feels a bit like a TV episode (but nowhere near as bad as \\"Insurrection.\\"  Blah).<br />I am a fan of TOS and TNG, but little else.  Everything since has had the dreams of Berman in them, not Roddenberry.  Was Gene a saint?  Hardly.  But he did know how to make a better show.
0066214122|3.0|I've been an avid fan of Crichton since the start. His style of writing combines technical details with a sense of adventure I've rarely found with other writers. In Prey the premise made me purchase his book as soon as I saw it. The first half was great, building suspense for the next chapter. However, the second half fell short, and I thought I was reading a screen play for the movie of the week. I expected more. As books go I would recommend it as a good technothriller, but not up to Crichton's usual par. I tend to reread his work again and again. This one I'll save for a lazy day at the beach after I've read everything else.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt has managed to merge hip hop, dance, ska, and pop together to make a CD that will rock your socks off!!  Gwen Stefani's voice is so unique, and the music just hits you between the eyes.  I would recommend this CD to everyone!  Oh, the other cool thing is that it's appropriate for any age.  I bought it for my 13 year old daughter.  I love Gwen because she sings about love and relationships in a healthy way.  Buy it for yourself or your young ones!
B00003CXIP|5.0|I have not found a movie based on a book as spectacular as Stand By Me.  Reading the book makes the experience of watching the movie better and vice versa.  There are slight differences, but like Stephen King says in the featurette, &quot;Movies and books are two different things.  They're like apples and oranges.&quot;(that may not be the exact quote) The acting is wonderful, as is the plot. The whole cast is superb, but Kiefer Sutherland is really great as Ace Merrill.  The best part, I think, is that Stand By Me evokes emotions.  I find myself getting wrapped up in this movie every time I watch it and that's really what movies are about--escapism.  It's one of my favorite movies, and I would definitely recommend reading The Body, which is the novella that the movie is based on.
B000065U1N|5.0|This was an amazingly realistic and awesome documentation of what happened in Mogadishu.  It is a little gorey, but it is a fantastic DVD that should not be missed.
0060523794|5.0|The most interesting part of Louis Gerstner's book is the three fundamentals that define a successful enterprise and executive.<br />* They focus.<br />* They execute.<br />* They lead.<br />First, companies and their executives that lack focus tend to be mediocre, Gerstner says.  When they encounter tough times in their base businesses; they decide to enter new ones.  Too many refuse met the challenge to resurrect, resuscitate, strengthen their base businesses and head off into uncharted waters.<br />Second, getting things done, he says, is the most underappreciated skill of an effective business executive.<br />Third, they lead by creating high performance cultures.  They are visible, set goals, measure results and hold people accountable.<br />This is a well-written book that Gerstner claims was compiled without the aid of a ghostwriter.  So, not only can the former McKinsey &amp; Co. executive focus, execute and lead, he can also write.  IBM was a disaster when he was recruited to revive it.  Few thought it could be done without breaking it into smaller pieces.  The man who saw things differently has something to offer IBMers, former IBMers and investors.
014028009X|4.0|This book will leave you laughing! It's not brain surgery but still a fun way to pass the time.  Seriously this was a very witty light read that just about anyone can relate to at some time in their lives.  Follow Bridget through lifes little ups and downs and laugh while your at it!  Bridget is a total fruitcake but fun!  Enjoy.
B000002L68|5.0|This album came out around the time I was born, so you could say I came to Prince late. But I am glad that I bought this album. All of the songs are great, especially &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; (the long version, which is better than the edit), and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, one of the most beautiful songs ever written and recorded. &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; is also one of Prince's best. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves the 80s or Prince.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|Lose Yourself is enough for a person to want to purchase this album. An inspirational Hip Hop record that talks to everyone. Also take a peek at Eminem's Shady Records artist lineup such as 50 Cent, Obie Trice and D-12, who all contribute to the soundtrack. A MUST BUY for rap fans.
B0000640VO|5.0|My boyfriend refused to watch the movie he had relegated to the &quot;chick flick genre.&quot;  But I rented it on my own &amp; then convinced him to watch it anyway &amp; we both loved it.  The love story is just a side.  I liked the modern style.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Even though the Grammy's did not recognize Eminem's \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" as Best Album. Ask anyone that listened to it if they were able to stop listening to this masterpiece. This album changed the way the mainstream viewed hip hop music. It may have had controversial tracks but a joint like \\"Stan\\" was never attempted in music until Eminem took the face of a desperate fan, in need and artistically expressed his position. Amazing.
B000002JS8|5.0|Forget Back In Black. Get this. Bon Scott is a superior vocalist to Brian Johnson. Highway To Hell destroys Back In Black in everyway way possible. Fave songs are.<br />Highway To Hell<BR>Girls Got Rythm<BR>A Touch too Much<br />Buy it
0792844890|5.0|I love Sci Fi.  I love Mel Brooks!  And the two together give you an incredible movie experience!  A tongue-in-cheek spoof on some of the greatest Sci Fi movies of our time....Star Wars....Planet of the Apes.....it's a laugh riot!  I've seen it probably no less than a hundred times and I'm still not tired of it.  I'm now buying it for my son because he loves it as much as I do!  You HAVE to get this movie, especially if you love Sci Fi. It's got an all star cast and the comedic genious of Mel Brooks.  What more could anyone ask for?
B000002KK2|4.0|For an album that was released in 1979, this album is amazingly modern.  The only tracks that don't work for me are Company, which I can see lip-synced on Travolta-era Bandstand, and After Hours, the obligatory end-of-albu ballad.  You can also hear the influence Tom Waits had on her music, although I don't know to what extent he actually contributed to the album, if at all.  Great album, though, a must if you like RLJ, or want to.
B000002KD5|5.0|What do you do when you're a popular blues band and your frontmen leave?  Hire Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, of course.  This is a great begining for the &quot;Classic&quot; Fleetwood Mac line-up.  Every song on the album is good, not a single &quot;boo-boo&quot; song.  Best Lindsey Buckingham song would have to be &quot;Crystal&quot;.  It's not really his song, though.  Stevie wrote it.  The original version on the Buckingham/Nicks record is better, but not everyone has heard that one.  I pity the sad, empty souls of those who do not own Buckingham/Nicks.  Moving on.  Christine McVie's best song on here is &quot;Say you love me&quot;.  That song holds a special place in heart, mainly for silly reasons that I will not go into.  Stevie's best song?  What could it be?  Oh, i know...Rhiannon.  Which is one of the best songs of her career, not that I'm putting down any of her work.  To summarize:  You would be crazy to not like this album.
0060922583|5.0|I read average 2 books a week, and this was hands down the best I read in 2002 - very inspiring without being  esoteric.
B00005OWEG|5.0|This is a definite, must-see DVD for those who enjoyed the original. Some people say that the added scenes were redundent or unnecessary. That is true, but this is why THEY WERE CUT FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE. This is NOT the original, it is for those of us who want the option to watch a few extra scenes that placate the unspeakable chaos which exists during war. Don't listen to the negative reviews, these people need to get their head out of you know what and realize that this is an extended version Not the original, and should be taken as so. But the option of watching the original still exists thanks to the beauty of DVD's.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The Civil War never fared well in the movies.  Let's face it, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a huggin' &amp; kissin' movie that uses the war and Reconstruction as a backdrop.  This large-scale retelling of the battle of Gettysburg is superb.<br />But REMEMBER, it's based on a NOVEL.  Novels are FICTION.  Though more accurate than Margaret Mitchell's novel, it's still fiction at heart, lifting large chunks of dialogue directly from Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winner.  It's a fine novel, but it has a revisionist, pro-Longstreet bias.  <br />And Martin Sheen as Lee!  Oh, the humanity!  It's bad enough that the best depiction of one of the greatest and most beloved Americans of all time, and anti-slave but pro-Virginia, has the dazed and confused character invented by Shaara, leading him to blunders in the battle (which are only blunders in retrospect, and everyone made some blunder, even Longstreet, at whose feet the failure of Pickett's charge can be rightfully laid, some believe), but Martin Sheen really is abyssmal.  He's a black hole in an otherwise intelligent and well-done version of this story.<br />Still, if all you want is to know what happened without getting into nuances of who ACTUALLY did what, this is a great movie and a great history lesson.  Jeff Daniels is particularly good.
B000068TSI|5.0|I remember so well the draft.  I remember so well the letters home.  I remember so well the young men coming home: some whole, some in pieces, and some to be buried.  In the beginning no one knew what to expect over in Nam.  But what we did have was our belief in what was right.  This movie brings back all of that.  It gives back to all the soldiers who were there a good reputation that some have tried so hard to take away.<BR>      I remember the young faces of the soldiers in the hospital confused and wondering why, this story may to some seem smarmy...but it isn't.  The movie shows courage, strength, fearlessness, under great duress, in situations where no one knew what to expect.<BR>       At one point the brass wanted to pull out the Officers and leave the soldiers, but the Officers stayed.  The movie showed our soldier in situations where they were over run, but somehow they found a way.<BR>        Does this seem \\"smarmy?\\"  It isn't...this is our history...when we get in a tough situation, we find a way to press through.  And that is what our guys did over in Nam.  Some may not have liked it.  But you were not there...our guys were.  This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time that focuses on the character of our soldiers.  It is a must see.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|ZOOLANDER is the greatest movie ever made.  It was, and is, so far ahead of its time that it's no wonder the American public was unable to appreciate it during its theatre run.  Zoolander's epic journey through self-discovery and actualization should serve as a lesson for us all that really, really, really good looking people can have a hard time in life as well - even though they will eventually triumph.  <br />Some people, all of whom are ugly, say that Zoolander is somehow lacking as a film.  These ugly people are unable to surrender themselves to the magical glory of this fine art.  Naturally, this is another instance in which ugly people are so very wrong; as ugly people so often are.  People who don't enjoy Zoolander are also not fully developed personalities, and are clearly jealous.  Of Zoolander.  Or Hansel.<br />I urge you to buy this movie.  Not only will you be supporting the arts in general, but you'll be supporting the really, really, really good looking people with perfect body structure and chisled abs and thick hair who may not have it as easy as you imagine they do.
B00005JLRR|5.0|First I'd like to point out that I attended the opening night showing of Nemesis, and it was great. Eye candy gallor and a good solid plot. BUT.... I can't tell you anything more than that. Real hardcore trek fans will probably hate this movie. And it won't be untill the end when you decide. All things considered its more than worth your [money].
B00005JLRR|2.0|The curse has been broken. The even-odd rule that said even-numbered Star Trek movies were better than odd-numbered Trek movies has been shattered. This film, the tenth in the long-running sci-fi series, is the only even-numbered outing that doesn't hit the mark.<br />\\"Star Trek Nemesis\\" (there's no : in the title) looks and feels like a pedestrian action film that somehow found its way into the Trek universe. The spice that made the earlier nine Star Trek movies feel special is gone. The characters we know and love are there, but they're void of zest and personality. Patrick Stewart as the venerable Captain Picard, and the rest of the crew (including Jonathan Frakes as Riker, Brent Spiner as Data and Mirina Sirtis as Troi) are sleep-walking through their parts. There is not one remarkable performance in this film, least of all Tom Hardy as the latest Trek villain, Shinzon.<br />Like the other Trek films, \\"Nemesis\\" is silly, but in a bad way. Listen for the way Shinzon's rubber suit squeaks as he walks in it. Notice how the plot lacks any exposition, going straight into the action a-la \\"First Contact\\", but how oblivious Picard and the others seem to what ought to be staring them in the face. \\"Nemesis\\" has more plot holes than any other Trek movie, and although the premise is intriguing enough, the script is so patchy that a five-year-old kid could point out the inconsistencies. Also watch the climactic battle scene for the way it liberally borrows from previous Trek films (most notably \\"Wrath of Khan\\") and blatantly steals elements from the original \\"Star Wars\\".<br />It's time for the Star Trek film series to reinvent itself. \\"Nemesis\\" seems tired, and is the worst Star Trek film to date, thanks largely to the lumbering plot, which seems apocryphal to Trek canon. Producer Rick Berman is the most blatant problem. I've never much liked Berman's style (it's ok for TV; inappropriate for cinema), and it's time for him to finally get the axe (at least as head of Star Trekfeature film production) and let the Big Boys handle the next film.<br />What's happened to Jerry Goldsmith since 1998 (when he scored \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\")? The music in this film is deplorable and lackluster, sounding (as it often does on the television series) thin and minimalist. And what's going on with the electronic keyboard-sounding instrument on the soundtrack, which makes a \\"buzz-whoosh\\" sound at the beginning of every scene in the film? It sounds like a teenager making homemade sound effects with his battery-powered Casio keyboard.<br />Although \\"Nemesis\\" had some effective and entertaining moments, especially when Riker fights the Reman soldier, I felt like everything I'd watched amounted to nothing, like the whole film dissolved after it was over. It seemed hollow and unsettled. Unconvincing. Unsatisfying. The sex scene--the first in any Trek film--is cruel. The action scenes are hollow and unremarkable.<br />Trek movies usually have a certain kind of campy endearment about them, and \\"Nemesis\\" completely lacks this quality, lacks any sense of fun or excitement. With Berman's producing and Stuart Baird's direction, this film seems like an ordinary action picture set in outer space. The characters don't ring true like they did in \\"First Contact\\" and even \\"Insurrection\\". I hope (for Star Trek's sake), they get rid of Berman and hire a real producer for the next movie.
B000068IEU|3.0|It's not so much the scenes of horrific violence in themselves that make one wince here (after all, presumably one has signed on for a hardcore violent thriller when ponying up to rent or buy this infamous title), but it's the frequent juxtaposition of disturbing violence with slapstick comedy that is the really unsettling thing.  It's really strange, for example, to see a violent rape & assault immediately followed by a scene of two cops having to hitch a ride on a chicken truck, and (as if that weren't enough) a few seconds later watch the cops fall off the truck when it stops too fast.  Very weird.  Also, the curious among you should be aware that this film isn't nearly as polished or professional looking as the slick box art might lead you to believe.  In other words, if you have no tolerance or appreciation for on-the-fly, low-budget guerilla film-making, avoid this at all costs.  I DO have a certain affection for this type of film-making, and even I said \\"whoa, what were they thinking??\\" and \\"Wow, that's really cheap looking (or sounding)\\" several times during the course of this.  Ultimately, however, I have to say that the movie is worth a look, but it's probably worth a look more because it's an interesting bit of movie history than because it's actually a good movie.
B00006RG9K|3.0|If you like the Invisible Touch and We Can't Dance albums, get this DVD.  If you want to hear anything else, you'll be disappointed.  The best thing about this DVD is it's the entire concert and not something edited down (although early on in the tour they went into Mama from Hold On My Heart; that would've been a nice addition).  If you like old Genesis, the Old Medley is great but only offers short bits and a hint of what those songs could sound like if played in their entirety.  They played it early on to get it out of the way, then got back to the new stuff.  And the commentary isn't very interesting.  At one point a cel phone rings and you hear one side of a conversation.  They could've at least stopped the commentary and started over at that point.  And they just seem tired.  If you want to see the band as they were right before they hit it really big and Phil Collins' solo career took off, get the Mama Tour video if you can find it.  It's got the band at their best and most energetic, with a nice mix of old and new (at the time) songs.  Hopefully it will come out on DVD someday, and with additional footage.
B000005H4K|5.0|So many times in the history of music, there have been summits where musical heavyweights are brought together on a promising project that ends up falling short of it's promise.  Not the case here by a long shot!<br />Jazz fans do not need any introduction to the staggering acheivements of these three titans of Piano, Composition, Bass and Drums.  All three bring their full talents to this project.  Mingus and Roach do not merely support Ellington, they push him and battle him.  Ellington responds in kind with playing with fire on the uptempo numbers (one can see where Monk was influenced by the Duke) and with beautiful subtleness on the ballads.  The three play off each other as if the had been a combo for years.<br />All in all, this would have to be one of my 10 favorite jazz disks, and one that I will recommend without hesitation.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth to me is one of those movies that seem to stay with you forever.  The entire concept of the film is unique is it's nature.  Imagine making a wish that The Troll King would come and take a loved one away.  What if it actually did happen??  What if you had to go and rescue the loved one??  Well, in this, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" fame) wishes her baby brother Toby to be taken away, only for it to happen.  Upon talking to The Troll King, played amazingly by David Bowie, she must travel through the Labyrinth to the Goblin City and face off against The Troll King to reclaim him.  Over the course of her journey through the maze she encounters many interesting characters (Hoggle, Sir Didymus, Ludo, The Bog of Eternal Stench, \\"False Alarms\\" & others).  Friendship, deception and betryal are just some of the obstacles that Sarah and her companions must overcome.  Eventually she does make it to the castle and meets The Goblin King face to face for the fate of Toby in a battle of the minds.  Will she win, or will Toby remain with the goblins forever??  You will just have to watch the movie to find that one out.  But I can say that the movie is indeed a classic.  It is one of the best fantasy movies of the 80's.  Jim Henson and George Lucas have done a superior job of mixing great special effects with a wonderful array of puppetry.  The DVD transfer is pretty good too, not top notch, but I find it to be quite well done.  The extras aren't too bad either.  You get a trilogy of fantasy flick trailers from the Jim Henson filmography.  Additionally you get a cast/crew bio feature and a pretty good behind-the-scenes featurette.  Overall, Labyrinth is a phenomenal movie that will take you to places you never imagined.  I highly recommend it as is destined to be a classic and who knows, after a few viewings you might find yourself with a bit of \\"Magic Dance\\" in your soul.
0385508417|1.0|...and you will never get that hour back, unfortunately. This book is flat-out awful, and the message it was apparently intended to convey is: you have to celebrate the holidays exactly the same (expensive) way your small-minded neighbors do, or they will mock and ridicule you. Blatant consumerism.
6305426651|5.0|I own this video and watched it for the second time last night.  The movie brings together the sad and funny moments that make Life Beautiful.  As a mother of a young boy, I was especially touched by the role of the little boy and his precious innocence. The movie uses humor to show how insane the Holocaust was, and how all people are created equal in the eyes of the Father.  I  have been inspired to give this movie as a gift to others.  It is a gentle reminder that the Jewish people were  tormented and millions killed without cause, much like the Messiah.
0385508417|5.0|The story is a keeper!  The kind of story you want to read again.  We will definitely see it again in the form of a Christmas movie for 2003 or 2004!
B00005JLRR|5.0|The long-awaited tenth film in the Star Trek movie series combines some of the best elements of the previous movies, along with elements of the Star Trek: The Next Generation TV series. If it seems a little too familiar at times, that's really okay with me, because director Stuart Baird offers such a complete vision of everything great Star Trek can provide its viewers.<br />Reportedly, the studio asked Baird to trim the movie to keep it short enough for multiple showings on each screen. That would explain the extremely brief appearances by some supporting characters. Their roles still work fine, but I hope the DVD will include a restored director's cut. Further, I hope Paramount won't repeat the past gimmick of releasing this Star Trek movie on DVD, then releasing a \\"special edition\\" or whatever edition after Trek fans already bought or rented the first one. I absolutely hate that, but the other studios practice the same marketing technique.<br />Back to the movie itself. The actors all give perfect performances, with some of the regular characters showing new sides, or sides they rarely revealed before. The special effects, though frequent, never look like special effects. Everything looks completely real. The action scenes alternate nicely with the emotional ones, keeping the movie from becoming either boring or mindless. In fact, I would call this one of the most emotional and exciting films in the series. I would also call it one of the best.<br />Now, can Paramount please make a movie or mini-series of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine?
B00007BH5C|4.0|I, too, was looking forward to this soundtrack after hearing the music from the trailers and tv spots. The song is a different version of a theme from the 'Requiem for a Dream' movie soundtrack.  Too bad it's not included in the Two Towers soundtrack. Hopefully the trailer will be on the Two Towers dvd.
0786889284|4.0|\\"Beyond Recognition\\" by Ridley Pearson accelerates from the first page, and with the exception of a lull at the midway point moves at a nonstop pace.<br />The lull is caused by a couple of scenes being too drawn out and what I felt a weaker subplot.<br />The story is riveting when the action revolves around the investigation of the Seattle serial arsonist and the interaction between Lou Boldt, Daphne Matthews and their team. The characters (on both sides of the law) are well developed and most credible.<br />Mr. Pearson did a couple of years of research on this one and it shows. It is based on an actual Seattle arson case and the procedural and technical aspects really ring true.<br />Seattle comes to life on every page with wonderful descriptive passages.<br />This is a terrific series and Mr. Pearson is masterful at forensic detail, without making it tedious. Highly recommended.
0140380221|4.0|I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.<br />Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.<br />Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.<br />This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not.  Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.<br />I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.<br /> While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing.
B00005JL78|5.0|Since watching Tom Cruise in such films as \\"Interview with a Vampire\\", \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\", \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and, especially, the incredible \\"Magnolia\\".... I changed radically mi opinion about his acting ability and his screen persona. He's turned into a very good actor, indeed and this movie is no exception.<br />This movie is 100% excellent entertainment and overwhelming special effects, with a very good plot too! I must note that the pacing is very fast, so, if you blink, you'll get lost...you get a lot of information right from the beginning.<br />The storyline focuses in Washington D.C. circa 2054, when the Pre-crime Department Organization, is on the verge of going nationwide, because up to the moment it has only been enforced in tha capital city. This Department has succeeded in ending crimes, because they capture criminals(-to-be) before they commit them.<br />In order to achieve such perfection, the system lays on three \\"precogs\\", human beings connected to machines, like sort of living \\"Oracles\\", who can \\"predict\\" murders, thus preventing them. But then, something goes wrong....<br />Excellent performances too by Samantha Morton (as the only female \\"precog\\"), who, among other movies, previously had excelled in a 1990's british version of the classic \\"Jane Eyre\\"; her acting is absolutely superb...in the category of such excellent actresses as Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett; and by Max Von Sydow, as the aging head of the project.<br />I liked this movie very much, as Spielberg's previous \\"A.I.\\" it's sci-fi of very good level.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I just saw Labyrinth for the first time (well, as far as I remember, though a friend says-nevermind) a few days ago, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since! I LOVE it! I already have a long list of obsessions, but this one has to be on it already. I can't say enough great things about it. The story is so great, and I simply LOVE the music! My favorite song is probally 'Underground'...or whatever the full title is. 'As the World Falls Down' is a awesome song, though, too! <BR>   The scenes if this are fantastic-I love the ballroom scene! <br /> Well, I could just go on and on, but the point is, buy it! Trust me! I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like it...<br /> ~Shelby
B00000J6AG|5.0|It really is great music, very classic, even if commercials have gnawed away at what was once new became stale and... distant. It's not Moby's fault, it just undermined what he had done on the album (for me). The tracks are all nicely varied and yet, it feels like a complete album in that they all seem to share some quality. If Moby had included some of his drawings, this could've been even better! Visit Moby.com which won a prize for best Webpage (it deserved it). I don't think '18' really compares to this.
6302824613|2.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" is the most confused Bond film ever created. It is a comedy based on the first Bond book with a stellar cast, but an awful script and an excruciating runtime. It's hard for me to watch this film without falling asleep. So much of it fails to generate anything that could possibly be entertaining. There are occasional funny parts and a couple of entertaining moments, but the movie feels like an over-budgeted flop. David Niven makes a lousy 007 who is mostly bumbling and completely unbelievable. Ian Fleming is turning in his grave... but he does flips with \\"A View to a Kill,\\" which is worse than this one.
B000063S6Z|2.0|I loved 'PLAY', I thought it was a genius record. 18 is a lot less involving to me, more personal for Moby I'd assume, more lonely, much more sad with an echoing wail. He sounded like someone very disappointed on their deathbed on 'Play', now he sounds like he's ready to die. Everyone notices the 09/11/01 aspect, apparently 3000 dead really put a damper on Moby's birthday party. It's not really a tribute to anyone, but a strange, detached commentary of how social/political issues hurt Moby. Kind of like a lighter, softer Korn, with dead female singers. If you want to know what the odd track is in this disc, it's easily 'Jam for the Ladies' where Moby raps with a lisp. In my opinion, a bizarre misfire, but artful nonetheless.
B000069AUI|4.0|I have been a fan of Coldplay since Parachutes, and this new album has been in my cd player frequently since I bought the cd.  I appreciate the way the songs move through different ranges of emotion, from the harsh thumping guitar in Politik to the almost fantasy-like scales of Clocks (which, incidentally, reminds me of something out of the movie &quot;Neverending Story&quot;). The prose is not at all shabby, and as a whole it is a great cd to pop in on your drive home from work to de-stress and daydream to.
B000001EXR|4.0|This album is even weirder than &quot;The Elder&quot;... yes, it does have that grungy badmotorfinger vibe that I read on other reviews but this is hardly one of the weaker efforts.  It's a bit of a letdown, musically speaking, that Gene &amp; Paul decided to reunite with Ace &amp; Peter because this album was taking them in a different direction and it would have been interesting to see where it would lead to.  I am a diehard Kiss fan so I can't say I didn't want to see the big reunion happen but look where it's gone... NOWHERE.  One &quot;reunion&quot; album (Psycho Circus) and they quit.  If Eric and Bruce were still in the band they would definitely have been keeping this band rocking for more years to come.  These days it's just Kiss Incorporated.  Carnival of Souls will go down in Kisstory as a MASSIVELY overlooked album and that's really too bad because it stands as one of their best moments, &quot;bandwagon jumping&quot; and all(lighten up you other reviewers)
B000065U1N|3.0|Black Hawk Down deals with a by now very well-known incident, a US operation in Mogadishu that should have been short, sharp and casualty-free, but eventually lasted almost a day and claimed the lives of nineteen American servicemen and more than a thousand of the local population, mainly because the military capabilities of the targeted warlord was grossly underestimated.  The incident had a major impact on US foreign involvement during the Clinton administration.  I am sure all of this is described well enough by some of the other reviewers.<br />Firstly, I'll deal with the pro's of the movie.  The battle scenes are technically excellent, and, although I have been fortunate enough not to have experienced anything like it in real life, they appeared extremely realistic to me (and are therefore very, very bloody at times).  The computer-generated scenes are also mostly very realistic looking, which was not the case with, say, Titanic, where a lot of scenes were obviously computer generated.  I also liked the fact that some of the soldiers involved were portrayed as scared and confused at times.  Lastly, the acting was reasonable, although not too much was required of the actors.<br />Regarding the con's: in the extras to the DVD I watched the chap who wrote the screenplay (I think his name is Ken Logan) said that he tried to make the viewer care for the soldiers involved in the incident.  I think the movie fails in this regard.  At the start of the movie an attempt is made to give each of these men a bit of colour/personality, by focusing quickly on each of them while they are still in the US base.  One draws, one is a budding stand-up comic, one enthuses about coffee, one is an idealist out to make the world a better place.  It's all very [weak], and did not increase my sympathy for them one bit.  I would have felt sympathy for them anyway, even without this rather contrived introductory sequence.  My other gripe is that the Somalian fighters are just portrayed asa bunch of crazed killers- at the end of the movie a thousand of them have been mowed down, but we know nothing about them.  Why would they want to serve the evil warlord Aidid, and even die for him?  These questions are left unanswered.  The portrayal of Aidid's officers is also [weak]: they are urbane men, uttering quasi-philosophical waffle about power and Africa and war, but they end up looking and sounding like villians from a James Bond movie.<br />In summary, I guess this is a very spectacular, technically impressive action movie, which tries to be more than just that but fails.  Don't expect intelligent analysis of US foreign involvement, Somalian motives or, in fact, anything else at all- there is none to be found here.
0316666343|4.0|This book drew me in from page one.  I finished it in a day.  It was so compelling for the first half, but I have to say that I think it dragged on a little longer than needed, and started to jump all over the place.  I was a little disappointed at the ending, but overall a good read.
B0000542DH|5.0|Why does this reviewer Jason feel the need to submit the same review every two months?  What's the deal pal?<br />This is one of my favorite movies of all time, but that is not important. You've probably seen the movie if you're reading this.  The deleted scenes are funny, but definitely deleted for a reason.  Buy this to own the movie only, not the extras.  <br />This is a sick movie for sick people... ha ha... no, looks like someone else didn't quite get it.  There is a message here, and the graphic nature of the film just drives home the point.  This is what America wants to see.  And the media can make anyone a pop icon.  We live in a world of advertising. This movie is far deeper than a slasher gore flick. But that should be clear to most people who actually cared to understand the film.
6300184080|4.0|It's curious that Cher didn't get an Oscar nod for this, clearly the best work of her acting career. \\"Mask\\" brings Cher as a drug-abusing motorcycle mama together with a shattering deformity in her 16-year-old straight-laced but practical son, magnificently played by Eric Stoltz. Together, mother and son travel the path toward social acceptance of the disease that makes Rocky an initial outcast before he earns through his own acceptance the validation and respect of those in his world. But mother and son diverge tempestuously on the issue of drugs, and Rocky fights in vain to convince his free-willed mother to stop until, by his own acceptance of it, he finally wins. \\"Mask\\" showcases Cher's incredible range as an actress, and she ought to have gotten Academy recognition, at least in the form of a nomination. She carries the emotional devastation of her son's death heart-wretchingly, and the viewer will be profoundly moved with a sense of loss for Rocky, a real-life person who endured the pains of his screen character. It's a moving experience, and humbling, too, for Rocky's station in life shows us that the burden we bear will always be topped by the burden of someone else.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a deep and moving story of Albom's relationship with his college teacher, Morrie Schwartz, with whom Albom has lost touch for sixteen years.  After watching him on a TV program, talking to Ted Koppel about what is was like to die from Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS).  Albom was both horrified and ashamed.  He called his old teacher, flew to Boston for a reunion, and began a seris of weekly visits, to spark their loving teacher student relationship again while going over a larger subject in their final class.  It was a new lesson of the meaning of life.<BR> This story concerns a man, twenty years after his college graduation, who is reunited with his favorite professor now suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.  Professor Morrie wanted to die as he lived by teaching the world around him.  Each, week, the former student, Mitch would visit his professor to learn a few more lessons for living.  On the thirteenth Tuesday, just before his professor died the student asked what he would do if he had twenty-four hours.  The professor replied with an answer not everyone would say, Do his exercises then enjoy his breakfast of cinnamon rolls and tea.  Then go for a swin, have a friends over for a nice lunch and then take an afternoon walk in the garden.  That's all he would wanted if he had twenty-four hours.  The days went by and the times a ticking, ending his day with a deep, wonderful sleep.<BR> This simple day that the Professor pictured, Mitch was surprised.  \\"So average that I was actually a little disappointed.  I figured he'd fly to Italy or have lunch with the President or romp on the seashore or try every exotic thing he could think of.  After all these months, lying there, unable to move a leg or a goot - how could he find perfection in such an average day?\\"  I thought this book was incredibly moving in the relationship between two people who seem so close they could be father and son.  On the one hand I was envious of the relationship but on the other I questioned why the author let twenty years go by without even sending a holiday card.  In the end, though, he really made a difference in his professor's life and vice versa.
6300214028|4.0|\\"Reds\\" is the 1981 Warren Beatty epic that harnessed the turmoil of the Russian Revolution as reported by American journalist Jack Reed and brought it to the screen in a rivetingly intelligent and thoughtful entertainment piece. As Reed, Beatty brings to the character a political and social passion that is eventually shared with his wife, Louise, played unflinchingly by Diane Keaton. Beatty and Keaton are aptly supported by co-stars Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton (in a Best Supporting Actress Oscar performance). The film is a stunning historic retelling of the political chaos of the socially and economically devastated Russian society and their implementation of the Communist regime that would establish the Soviet Union and last the next 70 years, most of them in Cold War relations with the Western world. Beneath the political drama, \\"Reds\\" is also the love story, probably glamorized, between Jack and Louise, and Beatty and Keaton are realistic in their roles. The film carries us from the planting of the seeds of Russian discontent to Reed's death from kidney failure, and in between we get an important historic lesson. This is one of Beatty's better and more diligant projects, and it's one that's earned respect and a timelessness for its historical importance.
0385508417|3.0|Some years ago I read several Grisham books until I got tired of the lawyer as super hero motif.  I decided to read this book because of the publisher's allusion to A Christmas Carol.  This description is anything but apt.<br />I assume that the vast majority of us couldn't begin to identify with the main characters and their vast Christmas expenditures..., the nosiness of the neighbors, the expectations that one would buy trees delivered to one's door, the police and firemen selling items door-to-door, etc. The requirements to be good neighbors were satirically delivered by Grisham, but way over the top for any of us living in the real world.<br />So much of the book rang false, I can't say I learned any of what Grisham perhaps wanted us to learn. I truly was hoping the Kranks would succeed in skipping Christmas.  The treadmill they were on is far more horrific than anything in my experience and they need all our support in getting off.  Sure Christmas can be dreadful, but if Grisham's message was that the rest of us don't know how dreadful it really is and we should learn from the story of the Kranks, he missed by a mile.  What I learned is that Grisham is still not worth reading.
B00006G8LB|5.0|This movie follows in the tradition of other great super hero films such as the Batman Series and Dick Tracy.  Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, your typical high school nerd.  One day, Peter's science class takes a field trip to the Columbia University science lab.  While he's there, Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered spider.  Almost immediately, Peter begins to change.  His senses heighten and his scrawny body is transformed into that of a professional athlete.  Its not long before Peter is jumping between buildings.<br />Soon, Peter enters an amateur wrestling match with the hopes of winning the top prize of $3000.  His opponent is Bonesaw McGraw, played by none other than legendary pro wrestler Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage. Spider-Man has been born.<br />Its not long before Spider-Man is swinging from building to building, helping people and fighting crime.  But, Spider-Man also has an enemy, the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn, played superbly by Willem Dafoe.  He flies around on a type of hovercraft, all the while wreaking havoc on the city and its people.<br />The acting is excellent throughout the movie.  MaGuire, Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) give top notch performances.  The special effects are stunning as well.  Comic book enthusiasts as well as action movie fans will love this movie.
B000065U1N|1.0|This was by far the worst movie I bought for my movie collection.  It was the only movie I bought that I hadn't seen in the movie theater or rented....and I learned my lesson.  Never again!!!  This was one of the worst pieces of acting I have seen in awhile.  Don't let all the 'five-star' reviews fool you....Yes, the cinematography and editing is very good (which is why it received an Oscar for best sound and editing, but PLEASE don't buy this film if you are expecting real acting.  This is the type of film I used to watch and enjoy when I was in high school.  I would like to think I've grown up and now enjoy films that offer more than 'cool war scenes'.  For all those touting this film, I'll bet they fall into the following categories:  they are either high school boys (which is fine), men who have not grown up, or jarheads (who in my opinion usually have the intelligence of high school boys anyway). <br />The film and script were completely predictable as far as being one of those  'way cool war movies'.  I know this was never supposed to be a drama type of movie like Platoon (which is one of my favorite movies)...so my expectations were extremely low.  Even these low expectations were not met.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!! (Unless you're still in high school).

0783235666|5.0|What's missing from this film is the signature Hitchcockian soundtrack that accompanies his mysteries so well -- in fact, it's so hard to think of an Alfred Hitchcock film without frequent collaborator Bernard Hermmann's score that this was the first thing I noticed (Hermmann is actually still credited as a \\"sound consultant\\"). Instead Hitch once again shows his brilliance is channeling fear to his audience by relying on good old-fashioned cinematic tricks -- this one, by allowing an overwhelming cacophony of bird caws wash over the picture every time you expect the music to help you ride the waves of thrills. Just as effective.<br />I once read that Hitch never wanted to make thrillers; he considered his movies \\"mysteries\\" (so it's to his credit that his mysteries still contain so many thrills, giving his audience the best of both worlds), so I accepted the rather abrupt ending graciously. There isn't even the \\"The End\\" typical of movies in this era, giving a sense of unending terror. Sure enough, we don't know if they ever get rid of the birds, we don't know why the birds attacked. <br />Although we do know that it may never happen, the attack scenes are frightening, so that you start allowing yourself the pleasure of the disbelief. Even though we're used to Lucasfilm-grade special effects, Hitch's impeccable craft commands the same intense degree of fear and suspense, and when you think about how many shots make up on actual scene is when you truly begin to appreciate his genius.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Am i mistaken when i assume that a romance or a war film (or both as is the case here), should elicit some kind of emotional response. This film fails miserably on both levels. Some of the corniest dialogue and worst acting since my kindergaten school play resulted (myself and other people in the cinema) in laughter rather than any other emotion. The situation itself-girl in love with boy 1, boy 1 leaves presumed dead, girl pregnant by boy 2, boy 1 comes back etc, etc-is surely one of the main and least original standard plotlines grafted onto any hollywood romance thesedays. Anywho, enough people have commented on the inadequacies of this subject.<br />What amazes me is the number of people praising the 45 min 'action fight sequence'. Yes, i can accept that visually it is quite an impressive spectacle, but a) it has been done before, and done better, and b)it fails to engage the viewer (or maybe its just me), Scenes of warships expolding, limbs flying round the place, and men drowning in trapped hulls should depict the horrors of war, and should arouse some sense of tragedy or sadness in the audience. However, you should not come away from such scenes with an attitude of 'who cares', as these tragic views are ridiculed by the superhero antics of Affleck and Hartnett. This film fails to convey the true nature of warfare, because of the ill placed emphasis on the love story of this trio, and not on a wider range of issues. NB, Saving Private Ryan works because we can relate to both the soldiers involved and see the effects afterwards, and we are not directed to care about which toy-boy Beckinsale will wind up with.<br />And as if our emotional reactions to this film have not be judged so ineptly thus far, Messrs Bay and Bruckheimer cannot ignore the urge to add a further hour or so to this whole debacle with a clumsy portrayal of the Doolittle Raid, in order to remind us, the ignorant audience, that in fact, Pearl Harbor was not an ignomious defeat for the USA, but we actually showed those nasty Japs a thing or two. I am sorry to break the bad news to everyone, but we got our rear ends kicked that day in December. Oh and this is a bad film as well.
B000067D4Y|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I knew that I had to buy it! Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman did an excellent job in this movie. I don't think anyone else could play Kate and Leopold like they did. This movie seems to have everything- humour, romance, passion, and so on! This movie is a must see for everyone!
B00004W52U|5.0|I got this CD 2 years ago and it took me some time to get into it. Once I did, my life was not the same. The lyrics are not just words used to fill space in between guitar solos and such. They mean a lot. The lyrics are screamed out at fever pitch. The guitar is so raw it almost gives you food poisoning. The bass is Matt Freeman. If you know Matt Freeman, you know that's some damn fine bass work. The drumming is often overlooked but it adds so much character to the record. Dave Mello just rocks the drumset on this record. If you hadn't guessed, it's my favorits record ever. Buy this album. Now.
B00006RU5B|3.0|3.5 stars...<br />This album isn't perfect. It's not really all that innovative.  If you argue that it's just a collage of pieces from Rage and Soundgarden you wouldn't be that far off either.<br />Does that mean it's mediocre? Heck no, not in my book at least.  It may not reflect the complete potential this band can achieve, but look at many other great bands.  Tool didn't release Lateralus or Aenima as their debut album, nor did U2 release the Joshua or Achtung Baby to start their career.  While Audioslave probably isn't comparable to U2 or Tool in terms of their style and sound (I don't think they're going to be considered prog-rock or pop-rock, but I could be wrong), it seems apparent to me that they are struggling to develop into something unique in the industry and, even if this album turned out a little raw, cliched, and uncalibrated, it is the first step to that end.  Essentially, if this album does not sound completely airtight or polished and if the melodies or vocals don't quite blend together seamlessly, I would argue that they shouldn't. I'd be a little suspicious if they got it right the first time to be honest.<br />In general, This is not a heavy metal CD like Rage or Soundgarden; it has more melodramatic and ballad-like tracks ( ex. Like a Stone) along with your standard heavier metal-like songs such as Cochise and  Light My Way. To me that's good; it signals a departure from the past and I think that kind of experimentation can only yield good and original things in the future.  The music is catchy and good, even if it is cliched at times, and the lyrics and vocals are very good as well.  Overall I'd say this album is definetely worth buying.  I think it was overhyped and that's probably why some people are dissapointed, but hype has a tendency to do that.  Morello's guitar remains top notch and if nothing else itself makes this album worth checking out.<br />Overall, I say buy this album and keep an open mind.  I listen to the album frequently and enjoy it each time I do.  I think it's a great album and look forward to a progression on where it's going in future releases. It's gonna remind you of Soundgarden and Rage, but don't knock it when it doesn't completely take you to either, and remember that this may only be the beginning of something much bigger.  Lets hope this is the case....enjoy it each time I do.  I think it's a great album and look forward to a progression on where it's going in future releases.

B000067CPX|5.0|When I first listed to to By The Way, I must admit, I was a bit disappointed.  I was looking forward to the punk mixed with melody that made me fall in love with the Chili Peppers after Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication.  The first single \\"By The Way\\" shared some of the same punk qualities as the songs in the previous albums.  The other songs in the album were more lyrical and featured less guitar solos from John and Flea(the solos were some of the highlights from Californication).  However, after listening to the album for the second and third time while reading along with the lyrics, I was impressed at how powerful and beautiful the Chili Peppers are.  Their message and maturity is more powerful than ever.  Their music is truly inspiring.  This album is simply a masterpiece.  Every song is written perfectly.  John and Flea jam in every song and the combination of bass and melody is phenomenal.  Anthony really puts it all out on this album.  He highlights his versatility.  He can go from soft to punk in the same song and do it in a way that brings energy, peace, and beauty to my soul.  You must buy this album.  Believe the hype.  The Chili Peppers are simply amazing!1
B000001FJV|5.0|I first got this LP when I wasn't even a teenager yet, and figured out where all them rapper types found their beats. This was the eighties, while James Brown samples were en vogue but before he began policing those who sampled him. Public Enemy, Sweet Tee and Jazzy Joyce, Jewel-T, Grandmaster Flash, Boogie Down Productions, De La Soul, Big Daddy Kane, Steady-B, the Jungle Brothers, Kwame, Kid'n'Play, Kool G. Rap, Masta Ace, Spoonie Gee, Ultramagnetic MC's, Eric B & Rakim, Sinead O'Connor, Mantronik, Run DMC, and a busload of other hip-hop and dance producers have picked this album cleaner than a post-Thanksgiving turkey. The music begs to be sampled; it became the aural semantics that shaped the train of thought that hip-hop spray-painted and rode to popularity.<BR>     And given a loud stereo and someone to share the moment with, it's great dancing. You'll burn calories, ache, and get winded, but you won't stop. As a deejay, I've seen dancefloors go insane to \\"Give it up or Turnit a Loose\\". And the immortal grandaddy of all beat breaks, \\"Funky Drummer\\", a multi-textured rhythm defined by snare accents that are tighter than a skeeter's [bottom].... For over nine minutes, Clyde Stubblefield carries us on the wings of one of the most difficult beats to play, the cherry on top being his jazzy drum solo as the song ends. Fried chicken and beer, my friend.<BR>     The only negative thing I can say of this album is that it is my personal opinion that the original version of \\"Hot Pants\\" is superior to the one found here, which is a bit more polished around the edges. But tunes like \\"Get up, Get into it, Get Involved\\" and \\"Soul Power\\" are as raw as skint knees. Truly, your life can't help but be improved by this record.
6305127638|2.0|I am most definitely a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and was one of the people there on opening weekend for each movie as it was released in theaters.  <br />After the bomb that was Star Trek: Generations, I was hoping they'd improve and give us a movie with quality worthy of being an adventure with the TNG crew.  But wishing doesn't make it so.<br />This movie gives us our first glimmer of the new Enterprise E, to replace the 1701-D, destroyed at the end of Generations.  It is a pretty ship, worthy of the TNG crew, though a little less luxurious looking, and more functional.<br />It's going to be tested quickly, also, as Picard and crew are forced to face their toughest enemy from the past, the Borg collective, which seems to have become obsessed with taking over Earth and assimilating humanity.  Only this time, they've decided to attack from a new angle - launching themselves into Earth's past, to assimilate humanity before they have the technology to resist.<br />A Borg cube manages to get to Earth, and launches a capsule at the planet, which heads back in time to when Cochrane was about to test the first warp drive - and make first contact with the Vulcans, bringing humanity into the level of a true space-faring race.  The Enterprise attempts to chase down the capsule, and gets pulled back in time along with it, offering them a chance to prevent the Borg from destroying Cochrane, and keeping the planet from becoming just another part of the Borg collective.<br />So the crew must convince Cochrane to test the warp drive, after the Borg attack the launch site.  During all of this, the Enterprise is slowly being consumed by the Borg, crew members becoming resources for the Borg, as the ship is assimilated, and the Borg try to erect a beacon to draw the collective of that era to Earth.<br />Overall, it seems like a great, quality Star Trek adventure.  Until you take a few minutes and evaluate the plot.<br />Simply put, there is no reason that the Borg haveto come to Earth to launch the capsule into the past.  This could just as easily be done by the Borg launching the capsule into the past with all the information they have, only doing it at a planet they controlled at that point in the past also.  Thus, they could tell the Borg of the past about Earth, and a cube could zip over to assimilate Earth at any point in the past they wanted.<br />Of course, this same technology would allow them to create an infinite loop of feedback - learn something, send it into the past Collective, which can integrate that into their knowledge before the original point at which they'd learned it, allowing them to learn something else instead, and so on.  Meaning they could concievably learn everything they could possibly learn just by going through as many iterations of the loop as needed.<br />What does it all mean?  Simply, that the whole concept is fundamentally flawed - that if the Borg had that ability of time travel, to use it in the manner done in the movie makes very little sense.<br />All in all, it means a possibly good movie is ruined by an unacceptably large plot hole.  If you want your movie without gaping flaws in the story, well, look elsewhere.
B00006JIAF|5.0|I have (hands-down) listened to this cd way more than any other cd I bought this year... and I buy alot of cds!  I love it.  I listen to the disc all the way through usually 2 or 3 times in a row.  I can't get enough and I can't wait for the follow-up.<br />  Also, I think Julian's vocals are great on the disc... I like the scratchy effect. It sounds kinda like the levels are cranked and his voice distorts just enough to add a bit more punk to the rock.  Very well done.
B00006NSGX|2.0|Ok...what is going on here? First of all, you record a cd and put the name of the greatest blues rock guitarist of my generation on it and then you make it sound like Frank Sinatra with a great band behind him?! I am an Eric Clapton fan, you know that guy that can play the blues covers better than anyone and once recorded with BB King? Who is this guy? Come on, give me a break, OVER THE RAINBOW? I mean, OVER THE RAINBOW, isn't that the song that was sung in the Wizard of Oz by this Dorothy chick?...The only thing that saved this cd was whoever was recording it actually did some great EC tunes. I thought I heard a couple of them up until that guy started singing like Sammy Davis Jr. doing some Howlin' Wolf covers. Please, whoever you are, do not do this again.
B000067CPX|4.0|I have followed RHCP since I was about six or seven when my older brother first brought home and hid from our parents BSSM (Blood Sugar Sex Magic) and I have managed to always find a place for them in my music collection.  With this newest album \\"BTW\\" there is deffinatly a new sound that says that they have evolved with the times and kepts current with the minds of of these times. You can hear in this album that they still know their roots and they hold this strong in such songs as \\"Can't Stop\\", in which the chorus intertwines their newer style that they spent time creating in Californication as well as keeping  their fast paced lyrical style from older albums such as BSSM.  Songs such as \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" express my personal views on how people should take on the real world and basically they seem to bring fourth the same message in this song.  Overall this album (IMHO) brings to the table a very nice mix of what RHCP have offered us in the past as well as perfecting their newer more melodic style and simply saying that they are still growing and have no plans of going away any time in the near future. <br />Noted/Released songs: The Zephyr Song, Tear, Can't Stop, Throw away your Television. <br />Btw, on a side note for anyone who sees this as a biased review, *Which it may be* I would like to say that all in all it took me along to time to warm up to their last album Californication and still find it to be one of their lesser albums.  So please take this review for what it's worth and take a chance to make up your own mind on this album<br />-- Matt
B00005RDSM|4.0|Peter Pan may not be as beautifully crafted as Snow White or Pinocchio, and the music may not reach the same heights, but even four-star Disney is pretty darned fine entertainment. Like those earlier masterpieces, Disney's Peter Pan is better than the original (worried that the Disney version is not politically correct?-try Barrie's story and suffer apoplexy). Saw Peter Pan when I was three years old and enjoyed it thoroughly again 37 and now 51 years later. It may not be highly refined, but it's irresistible nonetheless, and miles ahead of anything Disney has made in the past 30 years.<br />To those who want Disney to edit out the knives and guns, cast the Indians and females in their modern p.c. stereotypes, and give Peter a monologue about saving the environment in Never Land, keep in mind that when the studio got finished pleasing not just you but everybody else with a gripe, there would be nothing left of the movie-or of much else written before the current age of political correctness.<br />Give me Hamlet and Paradise Lost exactly as they were created. Peter Pan, too.
B00003CX9E|4.0|I believe that the acting and cinematography are what make this film amazing. This film details the life of Charles Foster Kane, from his days as a poor young boy to a powerful and successful newspaper owner. We see how his rise to power affected his friends and coworkers and we also learn the meaning behind his famous last words, \\"Rosebud.\\" I do admit that sometimes I was bored with the plot, but what I really paid attention to was the impressive cinematography. I was most impressed with the deep-focus camerawork and the extreme foreground and background vision. While some may be unimpressed, it's important to realize that this film was made in the 1940's and many of the techniques used in this film were unheard of at the time. It was a pioneer for future filmmaking and cinematography. In addition, the magnificent acting allowed for many long, uninterrupted shots. The acting is so good (particularly Welles'), you'd never know that almost every castmember had no film experience prior to this movie. The bonus DVD profiles the battle between William Randolph Hearst and RKO over the release of this film. The informative documentary provides some insight to why Hearst vehemently opposed this movie. With the splendid direction, camerawork, and acting, I think Citizen Kane should be viewed by all movie fans alike.

B00000JLWW|1.0|Sitting in the dark theater, surrounded by sniffles and cries, I had to bury my face in my hands to control my laughter.  Sure, the effects were great, but that is not enough to carry a story, no matter how emotional the actual occurences were.  From the beginning I could not \\"suspend my disbelief\\" enough to buy that our heroine, Rose, was cutting edge enough to mesmorize everyone with her knowledge of Picasso and Freud, let alone be able to freely run around the ship with hero Jack, escaping from the lower decks when other were forced to die.<br />I was supposed to buy that these two people found some incredible and enduring love, yet they experienced little more than a one night stand.  I think this assessment is justified when Rose shoves Jack's dead body off a raft at the end.  That's when the uncontrollable laughter started.  I was so aware that this was an act of fiction I couldn't find any symbolism in the act or further acts conducted by the aged Rose.<br />For this movie to be truly \\"epic\\" or great, why not focus on one of the real stories?  Why not learn more about the mother who tucks her children into bed, knowing they will die, while the two fools somehow escape the locked deck?  Why not star the older couple who lay on the bed together, holding hands, fearfully awaiting death?  These people had real relationships longer than a few days.<br />What burns me is that this movie won Oscars when LA Confidential came out the same year.<br />If you want to see something romantic and heartbreaking, I would recommend The Lover over this.  At least in The Lover the vast majority of the movie is dedicated to the development of the relationship, and character and relationship development is all that matters in heart wrenching material.  If Cameron just wants to sink large objects he should stick to his usual boom boom fare.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love Stripped.  Total difference from the previous CDs.  I always have liked the fact that she never acted all innocent and ... and tried to hide who she really was.....I love the song Beautiful.  If you've watched the video, the guy in drag looks so sad.  It makes me want to cry.
0385508417|5.0|Luther Krank has a wild idea: skipping Christmas.<br />No crowds. No shopping. No commercialism.<br />He and his wife have just sent their daughter off to Peru. What's the point of having holiday parties, decorating the house and celebrating Christmas when it's just the two of them?<br />Besides, Blair will be back next Christmas. Things can go back to normal then.<br />After some heavy convincing of his wife, Nora, the Kranks begin a holiday boycott. They won't buy a tree. They won't put Frosty on the roof, a neighborhood tradition. They won't buy gifts. They'll go on a Caribbean cruise instead, leaving on Christmas day.<br />As the Kranks slowly announce their plans to friends and neighbors, they quickly become the brunt of Christmas jokes. Carolers show up on their door step trying to convince them to get into the Christmas spirit. The Kranks find signs in their front yard demanding to \\"Free Frosty\\" and put him back on the roof.<br />Policemen show up to sell their annual calendars. Firemen show up to sell their annual fruitcakes. Boy Scouts show up to sell their annual trees.<br />Luther Krank won't budge. He sticks to his no-Christmas vow and has to be the solid rock to keep Nora dreaming about the Caribbean.<br />But on Christmas Eve, an unexpected phone call forces them into sudden re-evaluation of their strategy.<br />John Grisham's light-hearted tale is a great way to get into the holiday spirit. What gives this classic plot line a fresh perspective is Grisham's touch of humor and his popular writing style.<br />In the first chapter alone, you'll be laughing hysterically. Grisham brings out the atmospheres of Christmas that irk you to pieces and, at the same time, make the holidays such a special part of the year.
B000002P5R|5.0|Even though this collection of songs were not completed at the time of Hendrix's death, it is one of my all time favorites. There seems to be an unparalleled joy throughout. Some of the material may be a little uneven. No doubt Jimi would have tweaked the material to perfection, but this is a wonderful album. The sound quality is first rate too. A must have. It affords us mortals a peek into the future of rock music.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I just got the SACD of this disc today, and was very pleased with what I heard. It is true to what everyone says, it being a masterpiece. I'm listening to the disc right now, as I write this review. Here's my personal analyis of each track:<br />1. Gimmie Shelter - A good song, with a nice beat and cool guitar riffing. <BR>2. Love In Vain - A nice song, with a neat acoustic arrangement to it, written by Robert Johnson <BR>3. Country Honk - This track, though a nice alter ego to Honky Tonk Women - is still, for me, just a hair bit too country. I'd<BR>still pick it as a nice attempt to add a country sound to their music.<BR>4. Live With Me - A cool song, with a nice little funk intro to it. A good reason to buy this disc.<BR>5. Let It Bleed - One of my favourite songs. Nice piano, guitars, vocals. Another good reason to purchase this SACD.<BR>6. Midnight Rambler - Nice guitar, and kinda spooky lyrics.<BR>7. You Got The Silver - A good song, with Keith on vocals. I think it's his first song he takes the lead. <BR>8. Monkey Man - I love the guitar on this one, and the odd lyrics; \\"I'm a fleabit peanut monkey, all my friends are junkies...\\"<BR>9. You Can't Always Get What You Want - A more mellow, softer song off the album. Sounds great with the London Bach choir<BR>adding their vocals. A good track.<br />Yep, like said by another, the inside message \\"This Record Should Be Played Loud\\" is true. Go buy this disc, pop it in your stereo, and crank it up!<br />P.S.: Here's some other Stone's reccomendations for you:<br />Through The Past, Darkly<BR>Beggar's Banquet<BR>High Tide, Green Grass<BR>Aftermath

0446677450|5.0|The goal of this book is not to give you full answers, but to make you ask yourself the correct questions. One of the previous reviews was criticising the concept of not taking your house as an &quot;asset&quot;. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy a house, it means that you need to look for other options to use as investments that will guarantee your financial future. I know so many people who think that once you &quot;buy&quot; a house your financial future is resolved. This book proves all those people wrong by using clear examples on how we usually &quot;spend&quot; rather than &quot;invest&quot; money.<br />Please read it. It is the first step to a healthy financial future.
0060926317|1.0|Marlo Morgan, you are a disgrace. This book sickened me considerably. You are but the worst. Everything you wrote is a filthy big lie.

B00006CXXU|5.0|What a great cd! The best I have heard all year! Though I love her voice and talent, I wouldn't buy her first cd because it was all teenage bubble gum pop.  But, I loved her voice in Lady Marmelade so I waited and hoped she would come out with something more adult for those of us not under 16! She did when she released this combo of R&amp;B, Hip Pop, Jazz and Salsa, and lumped it all together in this fabulous cd which shows off both her phenomenal voice and potential as a songwriter. The tunes are catchy and stay with you all day. Christina has equally as good a voice as Mariah Carey but is far less annoying! I hope she continues to grow and gives us more new music like this in the future. Those that compare her to the other singers in her generation couldnt be more wrong, she has a wonderful voice dripping with soul.  I advise anyone to think of this as a wonderful purchase. I am proud of her for growing up and learning to please herself! Phenomenal cd.
B00006LLLN|4.0|While this album captures the crystalline voice of Alison and the incredible playing of her bandmates, it doesn't really catch fire. I was hoping for a bit more spontaneity and improvisation - the numbers are all short and just when you want them to take off for another round they shut it down. Its a small complaint for such excellent music but really this &quot;double&quot; CD doesn't differ that much from a studio album except for the crowd noise.
B00004WLXZ|3.0|If you have a diluted or very limited knowledge of Nazi Germany, or if you just never watch the history channel or have seen much World War 2 footage, this film with the narrative could be enlightening. And if you are a buff of that era history, you may find it enjoyable to try and pick out this or that Nazi leader. However much a step forward for film as art this propaganda piece might have been when it was first released, today it frankly does not have the same power. Even the scenes of mass rallies you have probably seen before in some history documentary, or in the news when they have huge parades. This film did not meet my expectations based on the glowing reviews found here. It is very repetitive, and the film techniques that were remarkable then are over-used now. There is no point in getting this film unless you are studying film history or are a WW2 history buff.
B00005U122|5.0|If you like Roger Waters ~ Amused to death CD Audio & Pink Floyd, with Waters, you'll like this!  I rate it a strong buy for all fans, (Five Stars).  For non hard core fans still a four.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell singing in front of the RATM rhythm section....sounds interesting. Does it Work? Does it sound like Soundgarden or RATM? Who will it appeal to? These are important questions that I will attempt to address in this review. When I first heard of Audioslave early this year (At the time they were known as Civilian) my interest was peaked. I thought about it...Chris Cornell without a band and RATM without a singer. It makes sense, a mutual benefit for both sides. Also an interesting case considering the amount of success achieved previously by both bands. RATM had not been broken up for too long, Soundgarden had benn done for several years. In the interim, Cornell released a solo disc, Euphoria Morning, a stylistic departure from his work with Soundgarden. (Which I happen to think was a very good album and necessary for Cornell to move on after Soundgarden) So what does Audioslave sound like? The answer is that Audioslave creates a new sound that is rooted in its members' previous work. The influences of both bands are noticible. Cornell returns to his roots, making good use of his very distinct voice. Morello and the gang lay down very solid riffs, some of them reminicent of RATM. Audioslave, however is not Soundgarden or RATM. They are also not a poorly conceived attempt to cash in on both bands previous success. They are a group of highly talented professional musicians whose previous success has allowed them to branch out and create what I feel is one of the strongest debut rock albums in years. It might not be for everyone, but I've found overall response to the band and the album to be very positive. Will it appeal more to Soundgarden or RATM fans? Hmmm...a tough one. I would have to think that Cornell's work will please many of the soundgarden fans who have been feeling very deprived for the last several years. Morello's fans will likely be very pleased with his work.Zack de la Rocha's fans might have a bit harder time adjusting to Cornell's vocals and a more straightforward rock record than anything RATM released. Still, give Audioslave a chance. I think that the band members previous work at least warrants a listen. I think most will really enjoy it. Cornell uses this opportunity to shine writing powerful lyrics and showing why he is one of the most influential frontmen of the last 20 years. Morello uses this as an opportunity to branch out and experiment a bit, further proving that he deserves to be mentioned as one of the best rock guitarists out there today. Rick Rubin puts a nice finish on the album. &quot;Cochise&quot; is a good song to get Audioslave's music out there. My personal favorite is &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot; but I prefer to focus on the album as a whole for this review. I think it's best to give people an idea of what Audioslave is all about. Some may that this album sounds like a RATM album with Soundgarden vocals. I happen to disagree. I think the influences of both bands are apparent, but that Audioslave has a distinct identity of their own. But since when have comparisons to RATM and Soundgarden benn a bad thing. They are only two of the most influential bands of the past decade. The bottom line is this: Audioslave has created a rock solid debut album featuring great writing, performances, and production. They remind us what rock is really supposed to be. If more bands could only learn to produce music with this kind of substance. Kudos to Chris, Tom, Brad, and Tim for taking a risk by making this record and succeeding all around. Audioslave definitely has a bright future ahead of them.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I LOVE this movie!<BR>Not only does this movie deliver exceptionally good attention to detail in its computer generated images. (the maggots and slime..ewww)<BR>The storyline and characters are unforgettable.<BR>Very creative plot and a great film that would appeal to both kids and adults alike.
0064471837|4.0|Garth nix really knows how to write dark and engrossing novels that are very hard to put down.<br />  Sabriel may live in a seemingly ordinary school but she is really from another land.  This place, sealed off from the rest of the world, was once a great and proud country where magic flowed through the air for the benefit of everyone.  However it has now been reduced to a wasteland swarming with undead while the remaining inhabitants fear for their lives.  Their only hope lies in Abhorsen, a man able to enter the world of the dead and seal the wondering souls.  He also happens to be Sabriel's father.  There's only one problem, he has vanished leaving Sabriel to embark on a desperate journey to find him.  Joining her are the strange cat like being named Mogget and a young man named Touchstone who's past is shrouded in mystery.  Together they must fight undead, find the secrets of The Charter, and save Abhorsen before it's too late.<br />  Be warned, this book is very dark and is full of necromancy and the undead but if you don't mind that then Sabriel is one fantasy novel that you will not easily forget.

B00005B36H|5.0|Amazing album from TOOL once again. It expands on what they started on nima, but has shown that they have grown considerably. I have owned this cd for almost 2 years now and listen to it every day: each time getting something new from it. This is a cd to explore for a lifetime.
B00000F566|5.0|...Dirty Dancing still stands incredibly well proving the point critics made about the film at the time of its release about it being a timeless classic! Dirty Dancing is simply the ultimate feel-good movie. The chemistry between Patrick Swayze (then relativley unknown) and Jennifer Grey (who has not starred in any major production since) is positivley electric and never strikes a false note. Its a charming story of a young, innocent teenager staying with her family at a holiday camp for her vacation who meets the exciting and rebelious dancer, Johnny who she immediatley falls in love with. They show each other a different side to life and soon become lovers. But as with all good love stories there are complications. Giving superb backing support is Cynthia Rhodes in a small but highly effective role as Penny Johnson who is forced into having an abortion and in the process must give up dancing whilst she recovers - enter Jennifer Grey. There are many fun and amusing scenes of Swayze frantically trying to teach Grey all the right dance moves whilst the touching romance between them gradually and beleavably builds. The ending is a triumphant high! What truly makes Dirty Dancing absolutley unmissable is the fabulous dancing which is highly erotic though never once tacky and is accompanied by a sizzling soundtrack that helps build the potential atmosphere. Superb throughout, Dirty Dancing is indeed a timeless classic!
B00005JLRR|4.0|It has been four years since the last Star Trek movie so fans (myself included) have been eagerly awaiting the release of Nemesis.  I'm happy to say the film does not disappoint.  As most fans know, the basic plot involves the Romulan's overture of peace to the Federation.  The Enterprise is dispatched to Romulus at the request of the requisite bad guy Shinzon, played nicely by Tom Hardy.  Suffice it to say Shinzon is not actually Romulan, but has engineered an usurping of the Romulan government as a means to an end for his grand plans.  The premise for his actions is sometimes hard to believe, but Hardy is convincing in the role.  My only complaint about the film is that sometimes the story felt a bit hurried.  At a running time just north of two hours, I guess there was no choice.  The action level of the film has been kicked up a couple of notches.  At times it plays like a Star Wars movie.  While it works for this movie, I would hate to see the future films go down the action road at the expense of plot development.  The epic space battles are nothing short of excellent.  Some fans have criticized the film as being too much like Wrath of Kahn.  Indeed the similarities are there, but is that such a bad thing?  I submit that in this case it is not.  The entire TNG cast is present along with a few cameo appearances, but the spotlight falls on Patrick Stuart and Brent Spiner.  You don't have to be a \\"trekkie\\" to like Nemesis, but it helps with the nuances of the film.  Still, there is enough action and story development to please even casual Trek fans.  Highly recommended for Star Trek and science fiction fans alike.  Worth the full price of admission.
B00004R99K|5.0|Why Disneys Alice In Wonderland is not considered to be on a a par with Walt Disney's other classics such as Snow White And The Severn Dwards, Dumbo, The Jungle Book etc is beyond me. The animation is positivley beautiful, colourful, effective, fast paced and makes for fun and highly entertaining viewing throughout the film. Though lovers of the book by Lewis Carroll may have qualms about the Americanisation of some of the more familiar characters it does actually stand as a fantastically animated offering of the story done in Disneys own inimitable style. Kathryn Beaumont is the voice for a cute version of Alice that bares slight resemblance to the Tenniel origanal. The story is vastly similar to the origanal story with just slight variations although like seemingly every other film version it does draw segments from Lewis Carrolls sequel, Alice Through The Looking Glass. There are such imaganitive, larger-than-life creations here with the Mad Hatter, the bumbling White Rabbit and the hilarious, bellowing Queen Of Hearts. All sequences surprisingly work from the Mad Hatters tea party sequences to the talking flowers sequences to the game of Croquet with the Queen of Hearts. Lots of fun to endure that all kids will just lap up. Masterfully done, I strongly rate and recommend this as one of Disneys true, enthralling masterpieces ranking right up there with some of his more famous work. Incidentally if you're looking for a live-action version to enjoy then you may prefer to check out Alices Adventures In Wonderland (1972) starring Fiona Fullerton as Alice.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Obviously influenced by Hendrix, I prefer it to any of Jimi's recordings and way better than Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Trower, an Alumnus of Procal Harum had that British Art Rock thing in his early years and that IMHO pushes this baby over the top.  I love the way the title track flows into song 3, reminds me a little of Dark side of the Moon at times.  This is incredibly exciting stuff.  Day of the Eagle and Too Rolling Stoned still give me chills.  James Dewar is the perfect singer for Robin and Trower himself will melt your brain with his incredible playing.  Highly Recommended
B00000JMQC|5.0|Disney captures L. Frank Baums darker side of Oz in this belated sequel to the 1939 classic, The Wizard Of Oz. 10 year old Faruza Balk takes the role of Dorothy Gale and makes the part her own. There is a much darker undertone to this Oz film. No colourful lands or jolly songs! Infact its mood is vastly sombre and hauntingly atmospheric throughout which may make it a little scary for very young children but its still an enthralling and compelling classic which is (for once) a respectable sequel, though you can never beat the origanal. <BR>The story is set months after the tornado which had transported Dorothy over the rainbow into the colourful land of Oz. Dorothy is haunted by her adventures there and so Aunt Em decides to take her to a clinic to see a doctor. She has to stay over night at the dark, eerie looking clinic. These particular scenes are spooky and jumpy and will have children on the edge of their seat. Its whilst during a torrential thunder storm, she manages to escape but whilst running away from the evil Nurse Wilson (played to perfection by Jean Marsh), she falls into a river and is swept away into the land of Oz. To her amazement she sees her old house that landed on the wicked witch of the East on her first adventure there but then to her horror she discovers the yellow brick road all broken into bits and her old friends like the scarecrow, the tinman and the cowardly lion have all been turned into stone. Dorothy soon makes new friends with Pumpinkhead, Tik Tok the clockwork man and a talking chicken (accompanying her on her jouney throughout in replacement for Toto). On her adventures she sees trees that have sandwiches growing from them and has to encounter the evil wheelers, the Nome King and Princess Mombi (another fantastic and effective turn from Jean Marsh who is superb in each of her roles in the film) whilst trying to restore Oz back to how it was before. Particularly chilling are the scenes where Dorothy is in Mombies castle and goes intoa room which is mirrored with different heads. Plenty of jumpy moments and Will vinnton's Claymation special-effects sequences are superbly done. Surprisingly Return To Oz didn't garner nearly as much praise and recognition as it should have done but even so, this is a fantastic classic that makes essential and compelling viewing!
B00005JL78|5.0|Why do so many reviewers feel the need write a quasi-novel when a few brief sentences would do?  How about telling us your thoughts on the movie rather than an entire synopsis of the plot?  Just a thought.  Loved the movie by the way.
B000059TEP|5.0|A timeless mix of romance, sentiment and the supernatural that is superbly evoked in all areas. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are superb in each of their roles. Swayze plays a murdered banker who comes back as a ghost and frantically trys to warn Demi Moore shes in mortal danger via psychic Whoopi Goldberg, who is vastly effective and highly amusing in the role giving this film a great balance of comedy and high drama. The comic moments merley proceeds to lighten the somewhat sombre and potentially maudlin atmosphere of the film whereas the special effects are positivley stunning and the love-beyond-the-grave theme is beautifully and touchingly done. The ending is sure to leave a big lump in your throat! Fantastically well written, Ghost emerges as one of the greatest films of the 1990's and makes compelling and essential viewing. A masterpiece!
B00005JLRR|2.0|I was disappointed in the predictable plot - twists and turns were a yawn. Special effects were routine. Characters boring.
0060526491|4.0|I just bought this book for a friend of mine; we share an odd sense of humor, and an odder appreciation for humor of the darker shades...I have added it to my wish list, and hope to see it under the Christmas tree, this year.<br />However, fair warning...If you are unfamiliar with Mr. Burton's world, and are thinking this would be a great kids' book, then please read through a few of the stories & poems, before buying the book. Or, you could just pay attention to the title: Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy. This does not really lead one to thoughts of a standard Christmas story, in my opinion. The title is really a good indicator of the humor found within.<br />If you can find humor in the odd, and the macabre, ala Gorey's Ashly Crumb Tinies, then you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for just another Christmas bedtime story for you five year old, please put this book back on the shelf, pick up \\"The Nihgt Before Christmas\\", and save yourself a little shock. Then after you've read your child to sleep with sugar plumb visions, come back to this book.
0066214122|3.0|The title \\"Prey\\" is, presumably, derived from the \\"predatorprey\\" programming used to create swarms of predatory particles on behalf of the United States Military. In short, things get out of hand and the particles esacpe into the surrounding desert [bad subcontractors] only to adapt to - and take advantage of - the surrounding environment as they kill everything in sight. The problem is, the action takes place in such a limited area, involving so few people that the novel loses its punch. Granted, the concept worked well for a very similarly themed screenplay, \\"The Thing,\\" but swarms of collectively intelligent - and malicious - nanoparticles just screams FULL SCALE ATTACK ON MAJOR URBAN CENTER. I can see the U.S. Special Forces playing cat-and-mouse with an elusive enemy that contines to outmanuever them...and so on. Unfortunately, I wasn't in on the plot-making process. My suggestion: Wait until the book comes out in paperback.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Anybody expecting a triumphant, \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\"-style epic from \\"Spiderman\\" will be pretty disappointed.  However, for a comic-book superhero movie, \\"Spiderman\\" acquits itself quite well.  In a smart casting move, the movie stars the legitimately geeky-looking Tobey Maguire in the title role as Peter Parker, the high-school nerd who gains superhuman powers from a spiderbite.  Willem Dafoe ably mans the villain role as Norman \\"The Green Goblin\\" Osborn, and as Peter's love object Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is, well, hot.<br />This movie is a far cry from the old-fashioned superhero movies, typified by the \\"Superman\\" of twenty-five years ago, where a hero perfect in body and soul takes out one-dimensional villains with no moral conflict.  Befitting these more complex times, \\"Spiderman\\" presents a more complex version of the superhero, a young man with special powers who has to make the difficult decisions about how to use them.  Before he's murdered, Peter's uncle Ben tells him \\"with great power comes great responsibility,\\" and Peter carries that weight with him the rest of the movie.  He has to think about how his superhero role effects those close to him, and his decisions aren't easy.  Likewise, the villainous Green Goblin is literally a two-dimensional character, with a split personality caused by his performance enhancers, and the movie lets us see the conflict between his good and bad sides.<br />As an action movie, \\"Spiderman\\" is a mixed bag.  The pacing is excellent, with action scenes nicely interspersed into the drama, but the action sequences themselves leave a bit to be desired.  They're pretty well choreographed, but I think they're a bit TOO slickly produced.  Much like in the two \\"Star Wars\\" prequels, everything's just a bit too glossy and fake-looking.  I found the grittier look of Michael Keaton's \\"Batman\\" to be far more effective, and I don't really like the direction these special-effects extravaganzas are moving in now.<br />That said, \\"Spiderman\\" is still a pretty good movie.  It's a lot more intelligent and ambitious than I had expected, and for that<br />alone it should get at least three stars.  It also has an absolutely terrific ending, not the \\"mega-happy\\" conclusion I was expecting, so it gets an extra star tacked on.  If there are more installments of this series, and this one's huge grosses all but guarantee there will be, I hope they live up to this one.Spiderman\\" is still a pretty good movie.

B00006LLJ4|4.0|I always wonder how Spielberg manages to give us quality movies time and time again. In my opinion, action movies such as &amp;quot;Lord of the Rings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Spiderman&amp;quot; can never measure up. While movie-makers continue to create the same movies over and over, this movie stands alone. Sure, I have seen plenty of movies in which an innocent man must defend his honor. But to be found guilty in a pre-crime justice system? That's entertainment. There are people that might have enjoyed the movie a little less than I did, but I appreciate originality, jumping in my seat, and being shocked at least 1 or 2 good times. I refuse to give you the detais, because I think it is more important for you to know what kind of movie it is than to ruin your chances of having the same experience I had by telling you what happens in the movie. Basically, if you like the same old stale story lines and minimal technology, Minority Report is not for you.
0062502182|1.0|I hated this book. If you've ever saw only the beginning of a movie, and already knew how it ended, this books reminds you strongly of that. I know that it is a fairy tale, but the unrealistic circumstances that surround this boy's life are at times ridiculous, and even disheartening when you think of real life situations. People, save your money and check out the Little Prince instead. All the important things to learn in life are in that book, and as opposed to The Alchemist, it is not ego-centric.  It really bothers me when people equate The Alchemist to the Little Prince. It's more like &quot;The Little Prince for Dummies.&quot;

B0000024W3|2.0|SELF PORTRAIT has its champions and apologists, but sitting through this interminable, lifeless CD is as exciting as, and ultimately less constructive than, watching paint dry.  <br />Speaking of which, Dylan painted the cover for this LP (see above) and called it a \\"self portrait,\\" but there's no reason to think the title refers to a musical concept holding together this set of songs.  Dylan's musical \\"self portrait\\" would be far more inclusive (and more rewarding to hear) than this hodgepodge of botched cover tunes, wretched live performances and weak original compositions.  <br />The very first track commences with a producer-engineer cranking up the volume level of the female backup singers, who open the track at too low a volume.  Great!  Leave it like that on the master tape!  This sort of contempt for accepted standards of professional record-making carries through the entire album, affecting the choice of material, the substandard performances, and even the economics of producing a two-record set when one record of Dylan-junk would have been more than enough.  <br />SELF PORTRAIT is not without its special virtues.  The \\"Dylan & Zimmerman\\" double-tracked rendition of \\"The Boxer\\" is one of the funniest recordings ever made, and some of Dylan's most strained, tortured vocals (\\"In Search of Little Sadie,\\" \\"Days of '49\\") are certainly departures from the norm.  But the good things about SELF PORTRAIT have nothing to do with good music.  It would be perverse to say otherwise.
B000063V8T|5.0|Season 5 is by far, the best of STTNG. &quot;The Inner Light&quot; allows viewers a rare chance to see Capt. Picard as a family man and has a touching and memorable conclusion. &quot;Darmok&quot; explores the importance of communication and the lengths to which an alien Captain will go to to establish communication. Also a touching, memorable episode. Tha cast have all clearly established their characters and their performances are unbeatable. A real &quot;Must Have&quot; for any Next Generation fan.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Bruce Campbell is back. Right where Evil Dead II left off, he is now back in Medieval times. He must get the Book of the Dead to return to his time, but the residents of the castle need it to defeat the Deadites.<br />Seems they had a bigger budget for this film, (the first two you remember take place in a cabin and some woods). The special effects are still cheesy, but that's all part of the Evil Dead charm. Bruce also plays a double role, both as 'bad Ash' and later on as the Deadite leader.<br />This film version boasts the original ending not seen before. I hate to give it away so I won't. But Ash screws up again as is typical Ash fashion. I personally liked the ending seen in theaters and on the original VHS/DVD better, but now I have both.
6305696071|5.0|A blockbuster success, Pretty Woman still remains unbeatable! Everything is ultimatley perfect in this timeless romantic-comedy classic. It manages to evoke undertones of gritty realism with a strikingly wonderful feel-good factor. The sensational Julia Roberts and the charimatic Richard Gere head the cast in roles that were seemingly tailor made for them. Roberts stars as a sassy, streetwise prostitute who meets with Gere one night who soon falls head over heels in love with her and offers her the unmissable chance of seeing another side of life. The sequences where Gere first takes Roberts to his penthouse are highly amusing, played out to perfection with the witty timing absolutley immpeccable. There are touching scenes where Gere take Roberts to see an opera production and when Geres business associate finds out that Robert is infact a prostitute. The film has a great balance which certainly were the ingredients to its long lasting appeal and the ending is quite moving. A modern-day Cinderella story, Pretty Woman makes for compelling and essential viewing!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's voice is exalting. Her voice is raw, powerful, and moving, like that of Gospel singers!! It's a fun cd and it reminds you of the upbeat rhythym and sounds of the 70's and 80's, like the Pointer Sisters and Donna Summer.<BR>It's clear that Christina has grown up stronger, with a voice far more powerful than Mariah and many others.<BR>Go Christina!
B00006J3WH|5.0|This is a great sound track which has really catchy songs. Several cast members gave perfect performances which was not expected of them (Emma Caulfield, James Marsters and of Course Sarah Michelle) So all in all this is a must have for any BTVS fan.
0140386335|5.0|The Neverending Story is truly a story for all ages. Anyone who wants a fantasy as exciting and moving as the Harry Potter books can look here. Also here, is a story with multiple layers of meaning giving the reader much that is profound to think about.<br />I won't go far into the story because it seems too complex for this type of review. Many of the traditional elements of fantasy are here, but they are thrown together in a wholly original way. There are a lot of characters, some of whom have to serve a messianic figures for the dieing world of Fantastica. There is a lot of exciting action, and there a a number of very moving relationships.<br />There are several ways to look at this novel beyond just the story; it definitely deserves a second reading. For one thing, deals with Bastian's existential quest for self-discovery, and it contrasts Atreyu's and Bastian's methods. There is also a lot of Christian symbolism as a Messianic figure is needed to save Fantastica from the Nothing. It also seemed to me that Baltasar's character could sometimes be viewed as a symbol for the Christian Church since Christ's days and perhaps as a commentary for how to once again purify it.<br />The Neverending Story is truly a masterpiece of Literature for both children and adults. Anyone can read this brilliant story and be entertained and come away with it with some profound insights. The Neverending Story will, I'm sure, always live up to its title; I cannot imagine any generation coming along who will not be totally enraptured by it.
B00005JLRR|3.0|Where do I start with Nemesis? Basically, it was a VERY good movie that I enjoyed very much. Excellent as a stand alone movie. However, as I watched it, I couild help but notice it had a strong \\"fan fiction\\" feel to it. It didn't feel like I was watching a Star Trek movie. Outside of the characters, nothing seemed familiar about it. The ship, the villians, the locations, all seemed foreign. One of the best things about TNG was that every episode gave you more insight into the characters. This element was completely missing from this installment. On top of this, everyone seemed to be acting out of character. An example of this Troi spends the ENTIRE movie crying.<BR>Now, the tagline for this movie is \\"A generations final journey begins.\\" If this is the end of the TNG movies, there was absolutely no sense of closure. The final episode had way more closure than this movie. Apparently, they trimmed over an hour of the movie out during the final edit. This feels very evident as the movie progresses. Certain events happen that in retrospect will seem quite unnecessary. (In the series, if Data changed cat food brands, it would somehow save the ship in the end. Everything always tied together very neatly in the end.)<BR>It was still an excellent movie with lots of action, a great plot, and well acted (for Star Trek.) But if your a fan of the series, it will probably feel very disjointed to you.

B000001DV2|5.0|The album Adrenalize is an awesome album. Compared to the Hysteria album, it almosts meets it, but yet it doesn't. But Def Leppard is always into new things, and trying new things out, and it might not be the same as hysteria, but it's Def Leppard. That's the thing I like about Def Leppard, always something new to listen to, and makes it interesting.<br />My favorite songs on the album would be &quot;Let's Get Rocked,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Touch U,&quot; &quot;Stand Up,&quot; &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.&quot; But, I dont skip though songs, I listen to the whole album over and over again.<br />I would recommend this album to ya, if you like Def Leppard music, its a &quot;must have&quot; album.
B000067CPX|5.0|While Californication was a solid CD with several good tracks, By The Way is a far better effort overall. While many RHCP \\"purists\\" may complain about their \\"new sound\\" I submit that this CD is just as creative but more refined than their early works. The boys have all reportedly cleaned up and are more into yoga highs than drug highs (their creative juices are flowing naturally)...based on that alone, one has to surmise that this is the probably the most honest release to date. BTW reflects that they are maturing and exploring new directions. However, there are moody ballads reminiscent of Otherside & Under The Bridge. Their trademark funky musical influences, social commentaries, brilliant lyrics, fun lyrics, and great instrumentals are all abundant on this CD as well. Typical of the Peppers (and especially Anthony), its sometimes hard to tell when they are being sarcastic and and when they are serious... but overall I get the feeling the songs are more \\"real\\" than ever. When I first got the CD, the title track was my fav...very funky (love the video too)... however, I quickly grew to love Dosed, Zephyr, Minor Thing, and Venice Queen. This is my fav CD (not just my fav RHCP CD) in a long, long time! I can't wait until they tour the US again and I can't wait to hear what they come up with next.

Costar Angelina Jolie certainly doesn't hurt the movie either.
B00006RU5B|1.0|I used to be a huge rage fan, its actually very sad what has become of them. Chris Cornell was the last person i would have guessed would take over zacks place now that i listen to the finished product i long for the days of the old rage, the lyrics and the music just do not go together, cornells lyrics sound just like his failed solo attempt with rage music in the background, i know these guys are all friends with cornell but why get dragged down to musical mediocracy with him? i hope zack;s cd makes up for this
0316666343|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" brings a new flavor to writing. Alice Sebold has expanded her originality in her stories. It starts out with a fourteen year old girl who explains her life. \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" Susie Salmon, an average girl living in a suburban town, was lured away to be raped, and killed. The murderer was her neighbor, Mr. Harvey. She arrives in her own heaven, where there were no teachers, and schoolbooks were magazines. As she watched her family deal with her death, she watches their lives heading towards a different direction. Her dad is trying hard to find who the murderer is. His investigations bring himself to believe that someone in the neighborhood, possibly Mr. Harvey, may have murdered her daughter. Her mother is having a secret adultery with the detective of Susie's case. Her sister Lindsey is now dealing with boys, facing the fact that everybody pities her for her sister's death. She can barely face herself in the mirror, because every time she sees herself, she looks like her sister. Susie's younger brother Buckley finds out that his sister died, being young and careless, is all alone. In heaven Susie misses her family as well as being with them, but if she promises to leave everything behind, she is granted a wish that allows her to fulfill one of her dreams. I think that this book brings tears to your eyes. Once you start picking the book up, you'll find out that you never want to put it down. This book influences what life is all about, that it's unsafe in this world, and that tragedy will happen to anyone. I recommend this book to older kids such as teenagers. This book will lure them to read this because it talks about a young girl their age being raped and murdered. Later on this girl explains what happens to her up in heaven. Dealing with family issues, friendship, and gossip at school is what every child will experience.  This genre fits into the fictional category. Alice Sebold also wrote another book called \\"Lucky\\". I really enjoyed reading this book. It reminds me of happy endings. It made me realize that nobody has a perfect life. And things can occur to be complicated on the inside for everyone. The theme of this book is that if you think you've given up, and the whole world forgets about you, there is still a chance you can succeed. If you are not around your family, they will still love you for who you are. It is a very uplifting book. I hope for many people to read it and enjoy it as much as I did.
B00005OWEG|3.0|The original film was brilliant. This version is bloated with fatally flawed pacing. The additional footage is embarrasingly bad - especially the French plantation and Playmate scenes. A perfect example of why good film editing is undervalued. Francis  - your original vision was excellant. Don't second-guess yourself next time.
B00005JL78|4.0|Steven Spielberg has always been good at action movies. Minority Report makes up for the sci-fi flop which was AI (note: not entirely spielbergs fault since the original guy writing it died halfway through and he was forced to try to piece it together)<br />In the near future crime can be predicted. By using three psychics who are electronically tapped of info, police forces and detectives can intercept and arrest criminals before they commit the crimes. The Crime prevention lab is in it's testing phase. It has already cleaned up D.C. and now they want to unleash this new breakthrough to the world. But one thing isn't certain: how foolproof is this system? And is it ethical to lock up people for crimes they havn't commited yet?<br />When Tom Cruis's character is framed for a murder he won't commit, he begins a long and confusing web of action, adventure, deception and remorse. Like all Spielberg films, you are sure to be impressed by his storytelling and imagery.<br />The good news is that the movie's special FX are more subtle and downplayed in the backgrounds than the overwhealming monstrosity's of Star Wars I and II. This is not to say that there isn't alot of eyecandy, just that it's better!<br />the bad news is for people who do not like detective genre movies. Stay away from this. It is a detective movie. As a sherlockian fan i found myself trying to unwravel the pieces one by one before i found out. It is a great movie with twists and turns and nonstop action.
B00005YW4H|5.0|and was intrigued by how wonderful people thought she was.  I hadn't heard her, only of her, so imagine my surprise when I set the disk in my player and her lovely, romantic voice started to pour out of the cd player like honey!  You feel, as well as hear, the notes, and I was reminded of how truly wonderous good female voices can sound.  I tested out singing along, but I really just wanted to listen. (that almost never happens) I like this girl!  I see into her future and she'll need sunglasses!  <BR>I do agree with my review-mates that there should have been a few more jazzy songs, but the song &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; kind of makes the cd for me.  Besides, I'm sure Nora will be delighting us with her voice for many years to come, and I'm sure she won't dissapoint.  Let's just get a thrill out of watching her grow!  <BR>Is it true she's Ravi Shankar's Granddaughter?
6301670132|4.0|SAYONARA is a great love story about American servicemen in Japan during the early 1950's. Viewers may be shocked by the racial attitudes of the American military brass and also by the treatment of women in Japanese society.<br />Academy awards were won by Red Buttons and Myoshi Umeki for their supporting roles. The movie was adapted from a novel by James Michener who had broad knowledge of postwar Japan.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Although Christina does have a new image, I feel this new album reflects her real feelings. When I first bought the album I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it, but after listening to it a few times I came to love it. My favorite tracks off of the CD are: Can't Hold Us Down (featuring Lil' Kim), Fighter, Impossible (which was written and produced by Alicia Keys), Underappreciated, Beautiful, Make Over, Cruz, Soar, Get Mine Get Yours, Dirrty (featuring Redman), The Voice Within, I'm OK and Keep On Singin' My Song. And that is why I can say this album deserves 5 stars -- because every track is awesome!
B00006RU5B|4.0|All and all this Cd is Fanatastic. Songs like \\"Conchise\\" and \\"Set it Off\\" show that the refugees from rage against the machine can still kick some serious ... and now they are even stronger with Cornell's vocals. Songs you can mosh too are nice and all but the album's Appeal lies mostly in the slow songs. With De La Rocha, Rage against the Machine was held back, having to keep the tempo going almost all the time at full speed since De La Rocha couldn't hold a note to save his life.  With Cornell taking the mike, Audioslave is able to make songs with a slower tempo and \\"epic\\" sort of quality similar to alot of soundgarden songs(think \\"Black Hole Sun\\"); the best examples being \\"I am The highway\\" and \\"like a Stone\\". The only fault with this album is only that some of guitar riffs sound ridiculously similar. But this is something that has plagued every Rage/Soundgarden record and none of there fans have ever seemed to care, just as Hard rock fans wont care about Audioslave's record.
0425098478|5.0|I have never had people working for me until recently, so I bought this book to help me get a handle on how to manage people.  This book has given me so many great ideas and things to think about.  It is simply written as a story.  There's nothing bad I can say about it.
B00006X06U|5.0|The people who don't like these CD's simply haven't listened to enough good music. Great orchestration; great jazz playing; great singing; great writing....all done in a modern style; what a relief to have this beautiful piece of music at this time.
B00005JL78|1.0|For some reason, the lighting on this DVD doesn't match the movie shown in the theatre. All of the light colors are amplified to a very bright white and the darker colors are hidden in black shadows. Everything has an intense aura and anything that light strikes becomes a bright white spot on the screen. Background objects and occasionally even faces are hidden by this effect making the movie almost impossible to watch. <br />It seems unlikely that this was an accident. It might be an attempt at art where the viewer gets to use their imagination to fill in the void of intense whites and shadows that occupy each scene...what an unfortunate loss of an otherwise decent movie. Maybe a cleaned-up, watchable version will surface somewhere.
B00006HBUC|1.0|I assumed that this movie would be on the same line as the Saturday morning cartoon series.  BOY! was I wrong.  This movie is entirely too violent for children under 12 or 13 and the demon images are extremely frightening.  I don't think this is an appropriate movie for children under young teens.  However, it appears in the search under movies for ages 3-6!!  My son will never see this movie in our home.  I am not prudish about movies for children, but this is just far too violent, and the humor too distasteful for kids of any age.  Stay away from this one!!
B000021Y74|5.0|I saw this movie on a listmania list and noted the high ratings, so I bought it and I'm glad I did.  Its unique format mixes media styles and throws in a few quirky twists just for kicks.  It has all the strangeness and black humor common to Monty Python movies, but with a deadly serious and desperate quality that oddly enough works really well.  I am usually pretty good at guessing what will happen next, but this flick threw me a few surprising curves.  It is fast paced, so you will want to watch it again just to pick up what you may have missed the first time.
B000002N2P|5.0|This has to be the best answer to the question what should a band do after relesing one of the most popular albums of the decade. The answer would be write an album that is the complete opposite of that super popular album. This album is way more intense and angry. Full of songs of confusion, drugs and cynical snot nosed attitude. That is what this album has that Dookie lacks is just real honest to goodness attitude. The songs are still really catchy but the lyrics are better, smarter, funnier and the intensity of this album will throw you out of your chair. This album came out about a year and a half after Dookie and theyre almost like night and day. Insomniac is just a better more interesting album.
B000068TPN|3.0|I, being a major fan of war movies and knowing some stuff on radio dialogue during combat, was majorly diappointed with the depth and research the producing team did on what kinda things are being said when a battalion finds itself outnumbered, with a platoon cut off. Furthermore I didn't like the thirteen in a dozen patriotic feel the movie has.....<BR>On the other hand Mel Gibson (besides the things mentioned earlier) puts down a decent performance, as do the other actors. The action (special effects) were preety good too, althought I again didn't like the fact that the vietcong and NVA soldiers were presented as gun-fodder....<BR>Overall an enjoyable film with a few flaws which, if ur looking for an ok, action-packed movie, will definately satisfy.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Yes, there are some inside jokes and tidbits for long-time fans of Star Trek, but they won't be noticeable to those who aren't familiar with its history.  But it's also a movie for science fiction and action/adventure fans.  I'm not sure that any villain can ever quite compare to the Borg Queen - this one just didn't seem as powerful or dangerous to me.  But the concept of an evil Picard clone was a great idea and there was some good dialogue between the two.<br />The cast looks great - I can't reveal the ending but it just can't be as it seems - MAKE IT NOT SO!  There are some wonderful shots of the Enterprise and the special effects are terrific.  If you're a fan, you won't miss seeing this one.  <br />I can't help but reveal that Whoopie Goldberg makes a brief appearance as Guinan!  I once saw an interview with her where she said she'd never been invited to be in one of the movies  and she seemed offended - so I was really glad to see those fences had been mended.  She was always one of my favorites.  Enjoy the show!
B00005QIPH|1.0|The hype surrounding this band is ridiculous.  I would recommend this album as an alternative to sleeping pills.  Its everything you hate about corporate rock, packaged to appeal to anyone who is remotely interested in underground music.  If their lack of indie credibility isn't enough to put you off, then I'm sure the half-assed and repetative music will do the trick.  After all, what's more ridiculous then a band that tries to pass off their expensive threads as lived-in-just-crawled-out-of the-gutter-I-found-this-laying-in-a-filthy-pile clothes.  Think about it. <br />If you have the money to get this album, then you should invest it in some music that has more feeling, that's real.  Buy an album by The Stooges, Television, The Damned, Velvet Underground, Murder City Devils, Catheters, Adolescents, Roxy Music, Black Halos, Warsaw, Gun Club, Lou Reed, Sweet, New York Dolls, even White Stripes(at least they put several miles on a beat up van before making it big!), MC5, Rapture, David Bowie...anybody but The Strokes!<br />Groomed Image + Rehash Rock = NSYNC for Kids Who Never Quite Fit In
6300263673|5.0|I love this movie.. what can I say..  The music is good, the dancing is good, the characters are wonderful.  It's a wonderful love story.  I have watched this movie so many times that I can pretty much quote it word for word.  It's just wonderful...
0151008116|4.0|I felt compelled to write because so many of the other reviews seem to have missed the whole point. I don't wish to give away the ending but in the last ten pages or so the author neatly punctures all the tales of derring do and tiger-management that have gone before with an alternative take on Pi's life at sea.<BR>Rather than bringing the reader closer to god, Martel is lampooning the insufficiency of organised religion to deal with extreme situations. Young Pi is forced to abandon his vegetarian, egalitarian, humanitarian gentility and draw upon the darkest aspects of his nature including murder and cannibalism (choices which adherents to Pi's adopted trinity of Hinduism, Islam and Christianity are technically prohibited from) to realise the one true religion of self-preservation.<BR>After the enjoyably preposterous tales of life at sea with a bengal tiger named Richard, the book was saved for me and made memorable by the revelations of Pi's alternative story.
6305537798|5.0|I love this movie!  It's funny, cute and romantic.  Ok.. so maybe I liked it so much because Heath Ledger looks so good in it!
B00007BH5C|3.0|As soundtrack albums go, this one is good enough. It isn't particularly innovative, but it serves its purpose well. However, as one review noted, the music that accompanies the trailer is not found on the disc. This is probably because it is BLATANTLY stolen from the much better soundtrack to the great Requiem For a Dream.
B00000IPAX|2.0|I really do not think this cd is worth spending 15+ dollars for, go out and buy Dude Ranch, or Chesire Cat, or even TOYPAJ. This cd really disappointed me for the follow up to Dude Ranch.  There is an exception with some good songs like Dumpweed, Anthem, and Aliens Exist, and thats about it.  If you wanna know a cd to spend ur [money] on it is Box Car Racer!!!
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore has indeed made another masterpiece.  It is incredible that he can improve upon the highly acclaimed Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack.  I was somewhat disappointed that Enya would not be making another contribution, but there are no complaints about the new artists.  I did read a previous review expressing disappiontment that the music featured on the trailer was not on the soundtrack.  This is becasue it is not from The Two Towers.  That music actually is the score from the film Requiem for a Dream and is on that soundtrack.  Just thought I would clear that up for anyone who was wondering because that is a powerful score as well.  So, I would no doubt recommend adding this to your collection.  It is just a taste of the highly anticipated theatrical experience that is on the way.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I have never played any of the \\"Resident Evil\\" video games, but I understand this film is very faithful to the storyline -- specifically, it serves as a prequel to the first game (the end of the movie is apparently the beginning of the game). As a video game adaptation, this film is one of the most solid I've seen. Yet it takes most of its cues from the video game paradigm, and is constructed somewhat like the video game we all wish we could play.<br />All the elements are here: The Red Queen, the AI which controls the movie's environment, is like the \\"dungeon master.\\" It's a lethal adversary, yet it provides backstory, context, and objectives, i.e. the \\"mission\\" of each \\"level.\\" Its primary goal is the extermination of the human characters, yet it bargains with them and even at times saves them for various purposes, rather like the way the rampant AI Durandal behaves in the famous \\"Marathon\\" game series.<br />The main character, Alice, arrives in the movie just like a video game character: No weapons, no clothes, no memory, just a heightened perception and a suite of deadly combat abilities. In order to work out her own situation and objectives, she must collect weapons and useful items along the way, and rely on her observations and on the exposition provided by others (as in a game's cutscene). That exposition, furthermore, is provided in a deliriously perfunctory scene executed as efficiently as a military operation, as if the filmmakers acknowledged the unfortunate necessity of this action-halting story element and decided to get it over with as quickly as possible.<br />And finally, there are the scores and scores of irretrievably feral zombies, which provide limitless guilt-free cannon fodder for the main characters to slaughter. This is something every action game provides in one form or another: Sufficiently independent humanoid enemies that are nevertheless so unquestionably evil (Nazis, Imperial Stormtroopers, alien invaders, demons, zombies) that you can blast away at them without reservation.<br />As a film, \\"Resident Evil\\" lacks a compelling storyline, deeply drawn characters and even well-choreographed action sequences. Instead, it focuses intensely on cinematography, production design, sound, and editing. This actually makes for a more interesting film, since nearly every frame is a carefully constructed movement within the scope of the film. Its goal, put simply, is horribleness. This movie, like other films such as \\"Final Destination\\" and the director's own \\"Event Horizon,\\" elevates the terror of danger and death to an art form. How terrified can you be before you die? Getting shot in the back or killed in a car accident is tragic and even painful, but at least it's quick. The anticipation of a baroque and cruel death is milked dry in this film. Irony, too, is an important factor, as in the case of the businesswoman who squeezes halfway out of a stranded elevator only to find that the elevator's about to start moving again.<br />Although this film sometimes gets bogged down by inconvenient practical considerations (like having to get from point A to point B), and the unending horde of flesh-eating zombies tends to get old, it's a slick, carefully-made and professionally produced distillation of horror that's as fascinating as it is artful. The music and photography are excellent, and if you have the technology to watch the DVD in Dolby 5.1 Surround, you'll love the sound work. It also provides a few fresh twists that defy conventional action plots, and a beautifully rendered ending which inverts expectations at the same time as it satisfies the story's arc.blast away at them without reservation.<br />As a film, \\"Resident Evil\\" lacks a compelling storyline, deeply drawn characters and even well-choreographed action sequences.

B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade is one of those rare entertainers that has what you call a real \\"fan base\\". Artist like Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Tupac are the only other individuals with such a devoted following. The Best of Sade was like a dream when I first heard it. I mean............every night for about a month this CD didn't leave the rotation. Every song is great but \\"No Ordinary Love\\" did it for me. I mean the love scene on the movie Indescent Proposal with Demi Moore and Woody H. was elavated with this song in the background. I went to buy \\"Love Deluxe\\" they very next day. Ok Ok...i went off on a tangent....Go buy the best of Sade and your love life will never be the same...<BR>...\\"Classic\\"
B00006LLLN|5.0|Do yourself a favor and get this cd. I discovered it through O'Brother like a lot of people. No regrets. Alison and Union Station are an amazing band and they somehow managed to transfer a great live performance to cd.
B000002H38|5.0|How many artist release an album that is flawless? Ok, you can stop thinking so hard because there are only the chosen few who reached that level.Anita Baker has blessed up with a timesless classic that has the perfect vocals as well as nice loving beats.The only problem with &quot;Rapture&quot; is that the CD is too short. Anita spoiled us and went off into the sunset. I haven't heard from her since.....
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is reminscent of the style of Dave Matthew's Band and other folk artists. THe CD has some catchy songs, but the less played ones are more enjoyable. I thoroughly recommend this CD.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Dido might not be an angel but this is a very thoughtful album. Yeah i'm a 27 year old black guy who listens to Nas, Sade and Anita Baker but I kinda fell on this CD. This female in the record store dropped it on my feet. We laughed and talked. The next thing I knew, she had sold me a used copy of \\"No Angel\\"..I listened to the entire album and really enjoyed what I heard but it was track #1 \\"Here With Me\\" that caught my attention. The beat was dark and the words made you feel her pain. Dido seemed to allow listeners to join her on a personal journey. Thanks for the ride...\\"you go girl\\"
B00005JLS0|3.0|Caught a sneak of TWO WEEKS NOTICE last night and was surprised I liked it as well as I did.  Boy meets girl: girl works for boy: girl leaves boy: boy and girl fall in love.  Bullock and Grant have some good chemistry here and the movies sails happily along for 2/3 of the film but the fade ins/fade outs were sloppily handled and the pacing disturbed towards the end.  Hugh, a spoiled rich entreprenuer, plays every character he's ever played before (ABOUT A BOY, BRIDGET JONES..., Etc.) and Bullock's character is an extraordinary attorney w/goofball tendencies and an appetite for Chinese food for one.  This film has a great soundtrack which helps progress the movie.  If you need a \\"date\\" movie, here's your ticket.
