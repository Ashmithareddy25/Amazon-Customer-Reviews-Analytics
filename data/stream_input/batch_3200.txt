B00FAX6XQC|4.0|enjoy playing this game<br />lots of upgrades and challenging levels<br />download this cool game<br />the heart kills are the coolest
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Love it! Great family movie. Those minions are awesome!!! Great sequel to part one. I highly recommend this delightful movie.
B005BO4OY8|4.0|Well written plot with great cast of characters. I couldn't figure out ending. One of those movies that keeps conversations going for days afterwards.I've seen it 3 times and will see it again.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very good.<br />It takes  us back to the same place and characters for &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;<br />It is a smooth read and keeps you on your toes.  The only thing I found a little off putting was that I figured out the ending about two thirds through.  However, it did not take away from  his excellant prose and story telling.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|I love everything about this movie, it is family friendly and tells a good story. There is nothing bad in this movie! I have only seen a handful of movies come out of Finnland, and i have liked all of them so far. The movie has a plot where people come together and happily helping out a child in need. The characters show generosity, understanding, personal moral growth, forgiveness, and love for fellow man.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of John Grisham's best.  Intriguing story right to the last page. Nobody spins a tale like Grisham does and this book is exceptional.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's A very good game with a lot of puzzles to do, enyoy it and have a good time with it. EASY to play.
B003008RWA|5.0|This was eye opening, a very good watch. Its insane what insurance companies get away with! I highly reccomend this to anyone interested in things like this.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Another one that keeps you guessing till the end. Some very dark spots, but I couldn't put it down. Great whodunit.
B00004TDTO|5.0|No one can deny this is one of Spielberg's top 5 best films.  It has everything - superbly acted drama, suspense, action and adventure.  Also, it takes me back to what now seems a quaint time… when the biggest threat to New Yorkers one Summer is not Osama Bin Laden or financial instruments of mass destruction but a fish.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|a great conclusion to the series. Very well made and the action is superb! Of course Gwyneth is a dream once again!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game has the right balance of challenge and fun.  Graphics are cute and the music while repetitive fits the mood and doesn't drive you nuts.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Mesmerizing documentary.  When a man fixes his whole life and destiny on a goal, no matter how impossible it may appear, the whole universe seems to conspire with him to achieve it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I love all of the Fire Maple Games, and Mosaika is exactly what you'd expect if you've played either of their previous releases.  It's fun, quirky, beautifully rendered and artistic with challenging puzzles.  My only complaint is that I truly wish it was longer.  The Lost City took me at least 3 times as long to finish...where as I whisked through Mosaika in just a few hours. Still, the work that FMG puts into their games is outstanding and truly sets them apart from many of the other adventure games.  Loved it.
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|Still an awesome movie, action and adventure!! Keeps getting better and better! Uasually sequels start getting boring after 4 movie but not this one
0446578800|5.0|Anything he writes is great!I share all my books by him with a friend who also loves his fiction!Wonderful!I will continue to buy all his books.
B005LAII1C|5.0|awesome movie funny very good movie my wife and i could not stop laughing if you need a great funny movie this is it
B00DHRLK84|2.0|Did not care for it,  also this same movie sold at Walmart at the same time I purchase it for $10.00 less , had I known that I wouldn't have open the package.
B00GQ7PILC|5.0|What a bunch of crappy reviews. I thought the season and the final episode in particular was fine. It was better than season 7. I thought the finale was heart wrenching. Though the last 40 seconds ameliorates that somewhat. Sure it's not perfect, and it's not the best season (season four is the best, and the first four are better than the last four). It is even more of a drama or soap opera than previous episodes. But that was always its strength anyway. It was just a great drama (with stylized gore, and improbable action).
B003F48E4W|5.0|still a great movie this is one of the movies i remember watching when i was younger i still really liked it when i watched it again
B005KJZDW6|5.0|One of, if not, the best Christmas Albums EVER!!! Had to get the LP for my record player, cannot stop listing to the LP!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie shows me a lot of things<br />First it is about  Making the family happy<br />Second it shows corporate greed.<br />Then the overall what Christmas is really about.  Giving.  Funny  I love this movie just had to have it in its best presentation.  Long live the. Griswolds
B009Z5975A|5.0|i love the classic combo pack all of the movies are great and still make me happy to watch and enjoy with my wife and daughter
B003O86FMW|4.0|I can't wait to finish the series!  What turns and fates wait for Katniss. I'm completely hooked. Bring on mocking jay.
B001XCWPAM|1.0|Does not work for U.S. blue ray players.... now have to return it... :( not worth the hassle at all
B00BSWMITK|5.0|One of the best &#34;Guitar&#34; albums I've heard in a long time. Every song is very listenable-nothing over the top (excessive screeching pinch harmonics, etc.) and no duds. Satriani is one of the most technically proficient guitarists out there. However, all the skills in the world don't mean much to my ears if there isn't a decent hook in there to interest the listener. Luckily, for the listener, catchy riffs abound. If your a fan of great guitar work then this is one to put on your short list.
0765348780|4.0|I would absolutely recommend reading the book. Steven Erikson has this way of writing that throws everything at you all at once in the beginning, rolls along, then elucidates all of the murky points if you pay assiduous attention. It's a refreshing read in comparison to other fantasy series out there. A tendency in the genre is to have one exposition or history book character that explains all that occurs and the fantasy world's grand history. Not in this. Several characters drip tidbits of world history here and there, never revealing everything there is to know, leaving an air of mystery. Erikson keeps his world fresh and mystifying all through this book and even up to about book 7. It's a refreshing read in comparison to other fantasy series out there.<br /><br />Characters are usually left vaguely described, however this does not detract from story, but emphasizes more important characters. Rather, the crowning feature of this book and the other books in the series is the masterful plots Erikson creates. By the end of the book, you'll be sitting at awe, wondering how everything tumbles into place just so.<br /><br />The only downside to the book is how long it is. Not ALL of the portions of the book are necessary, but towards the end it's very easy to forgive Erikson for not being laconic enough.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album was a step up from St. Anger.  It has some of the heaviest music with blazing solos that we haven't from them in a long time.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|Baz Luhrmann does it again! Brilliant musical choices and you can relive the movie through the music.  Definitely recommend the extended version for the extra songs and remixes.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|This is a tension filled look at the lives of a small group of mercenaries.  The film is action packed with a great cast, great acting, and a plausible story-line.  It is also gory and violent.  Some of the characters in this film are likeable, honorable and brave while others don't seem to have any of these qualities.  That being said, it is not hard for the viewer to look beyond this film and see how sad and lonely a soldier's life can become when he or she is no longer needed and merely exists from one paycheck to the next.
B000001FQQ|4.0|I am one of those Kiss fans that liked their 70's albums more than what they did after that, but this album which was released in 89 was probably their best 80's album.  I got it mainly for the top 10 hit Forever which was their first since Beth.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Challenging yet moves , flows with continuous challenges, as you progress through the levels. Keep up the good  work. Add a few wild tiles to better enhance the game.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|Anything BARBRA does is a 5 star rating.  Saw this show ( or similar ) in San Jose, Ca and it wasn't near as good as this DVD in Brooklyn.  Guess even the BEST SINGER/ACTRESS ever, can have a bad night...But even her bad night, was still the best for me!!
B001I10ABO|5.0|If it is Thrash Metal you want then Master of Puppets is the way to go, but if you want great 90's classic Hard Rock/Heavy Metal then this is the way to go.  The album has 4 top 40 hits and sold over 15 million copies in America alone.  In short this album should be in any rock collection.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a good game to play because it doesn't take a lot of concentration.  I enjoy playing anytime of day.
0316001821|3.0|Purchased as a gift; It's a good read.<br />Somewhat disappointed in the paper quality, which seemed more like heavy newspaper and also the uneven edges of the paper.
B003Y3BMG6|5.0|I got this album because it is a best of collection from beginning to end.  There is a lot of good stuff on here.
B00H2D1XDQ|5.0|Phatpuppy artwork is always a level above the usual hidden object games.  The Christmas game is perfect for the holidays.  Packed full of levels... tons of items that change each game.  Different ways to find the items and a bunch of game modes.  Love it!  : )
B00EPVTLKU|4.0|Up and coming star. Powerhouse vocals and knows when to dial it down. Look past the comparisons to others and take a listen on her own merits. There are hits hidden here waiting to be discovered. Well worth the time and effort to discover a young artist gaining traction without the need of a ride on a wrecking ball.
B000M3GEWS|5.0|I think this might be the Beatles most underrated album.  It wasn't in Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time and if Let It Be is, then this album should have also been included.  The track I am the Walrus alone is reason for any rock fan in general to get it and the rest of the album is just as good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like the game flow because I pasted all of the levels and I am getting the flow bridge's and I am going to past all of them I just got done with it on December 4 2013 happy Christmas I know you are going to past it I just know it good luck it is very hard and comment and tell me what you want for Christmas because what I want for Christmas is an I phone touch because I'm only in 5th grade what grade are you guys in comment me down below thank you you guys are my forgotten people I even if I don't know you guys  good bye I love you guys bye this game is afflicting
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device that fills 90% most of my needs.  The one biggest problem is that it does not allow me to cast all the content to my screen.  I would love to see games, websites (not using the chrome browser extension), and other content cast to my screen.
B00000DS2K|4.0|Another album with Jake E Lee on guitar.  Bark at the Moon is probably better, but this one is pretty good.  Best tracks are Shot in the Dark and the title track.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love these books they are everything romance exciting sad  anyone can read them young old man or woman enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to finally see this on kindle. I've been waiting for a long time to see this app. It's highly addictive and will keep you entertained for hours. I love this game, even though it's crazy .
B000002KZT|5.0|Angel of Death is enough of a reason to get this album for anyone who likes thrash metal.  Only problem is it clocks in at only 29 minutes.  Their other albums after this get longer and better.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is an ok game. It is a little boring at times. There should be more options on how you can control your horse.<br />I love horses.
B00GNK18X4|5.0|I love this album!! Out of all the three albums the boys have made this is my most favorite <3 Im so proud of the boys they've made it so far and they really did go from the bottom of the stairs to the top of the world <3
B000002B7S|4.0|What an unfortunate thing that Randy Rhodes died before this album was made.  Jake E Lee is no Randy Rhodes, but he gets the job done pretty well.  Best tracks are Rock and Roll Rebel, So Tired and of course the title track.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|I read a few reviews on this movie, before i bought it and....it turned out to be a great movie!Some people got too tech on the movie and gave it a one star...not wise. They talked about how the style changed from only using hands to using the legs and high kicks as well... great movie...if your a marital arts fan? Buy this movie...you wont be sorry!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love reading stories like this and how you can connect to it. The movie was great but they left a lot of details out.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Amazing book. Read it more that 4 times, not including the time that we had to read it during class. It's very touching.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|i found this to be boring shortly after i played it and was not worth keeping even though it was a free app
B009GXHOW4|2.0|Sucks. It is just plain horrible. Switched my survival world to creative mode, and when I tried to change it back to survival, it said survival when I exited the app, but when I came back to mcpe, it still said creative. That is why it is only 2 stars. If you have a Samsung, You can get Inventory Editor for MCPE by Timothy Buzzeli. Trust me it's way better.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|excellent movie! A Must See and the excitement never ever STOPS! You will NEVER guess the ending on this movie! I was Greatly surprised and relieved that I was not able to Predict this movie! Thanks
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. It has a heavy story line and is great for anyone who likes action and adventure. I can't think of a more sad and amazing story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game  Jennings season daresundays and phil Hughes medical institute in my room please answer to live in the walking distance of this house and the biggest loser
B0063M22QO|3.0|Because you can hardly see it (even pressing the BIG button) until your game is almost ended and it enlarges.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|This book is written in simple easy English so most people understand .  It is helpful in changing one's way of thinking and acting  From being negative to be more positive.<br /><br />This book explains how important it is to have positive outlook to make life more satisfying and in maintaining a stable mood.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Best classic movie ever! Watched as a kid and now with my kids! Great times for a family movie night!
0804161380|3.0|the books are amazing but the &#34;chest&#34; they come in is poorly made. kindve hoped that something this expensive would've been made better.
B00785P2QC|5.0|So far thus his game is pretty fun. It's easy enough that my 5 year old twins enjoy playing it.
B00FPX54DA|5.0|Beautiful music and great for the season.  I have not found anything here I did not like.  I hope these guys keep this up.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|So many different types of the classic characters we all know and love and its so fun an  there is so much to do
1419702238|5.0|I have one grandson that read every book with a passion.  He is being followed by his younger brother who has requested that I be notified of every new book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Grouts writing is amusing and brings a new perspective to our thoughts and actions. Its a fun read with lots to learn
B008JFUR10|1.0|And one thing you don't have to do is to watch this stupid movie.<br /><br />This movie is a stillborn child of Godzilla and Transformers. If it was called Godzformers and had no human actors it would get 2 stars. The way it is one star is one too many.
B008Q7O6VS|4.0|There is no remaster here, so in general, it's just the original Countdown to Extinction album, plus the San Francisco's Cow Palace, which I have to say; is quite good, the poster and the postcards, all in the anniversary edition box. For the price, it's quite good.<br /><br />The only down-side is the poster, it's folded horribly, and ALL of the posters come like this, they are terrible.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|This app used to be well worth the money. However, now with Google putting out quickoffice, there's no need for it. If you don't have it, sideload the APK. It's free and works great. This is $5. Pass...
B00821PCJS|4.0|very entertaining with good plot. I particullary enjoyed the family values and the bonding the 2nd Mass had with each other.
0316055433|5.0|There are only a hand full of books that have stayed with me long after I have read it - I call them WOW books because after you read the last page and close the book for the last time you sit for a moment sad that its over and the only word that conveys your feelings is - WOW! The masterpiece is not the painting of the Goldfinch but rather the masterpiece of the characters and settings painted by the words of Donna Tartt. Be forewarned this book is not for everyone this is literary fiction so if you are looking for a fast paced shoot'em up who dunnit  this book is not for you. However if you want to experience a story that is so well written you feel emotionally part of the hero and scenery so vividly written you can actually feel you are there then buy this book. I was so engrossed in the story I felt that Theo Decker was a part of me I felt his heartaches and feelings of desperation. If the purpose of writing is to evoke emotion then this book deserves a Pulitzer.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Quality film.  Kept me entertained.  Connected a lot of dots after seeing the avengers.  Ready to see the second.<br /><br />I would watch again.
B000LXQVA4|3.0|Holy cow this thing is giant and kind of hideous looking.  That being said if it can keep my son entertained it's all worth it.  Right now he's 4 months old and seems to get mildly freaked out when I put him in.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Nice touch version of a favorite old pc game . I'm sure I'll use it a lot.<br />Easy to pick up how to use it.
B008OE05IG|4.0|Fascinating documentary of a man devoted to his craft and the legacy he will be leaving behind in the art of sushi making.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Too complicated, always updating, just not any fun. When I hit a rocket, very slow to resume running.  Just not for me.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The free app for kindle is not stable , it freezes constantly , pages dont load appropriately. It is a waste of time. I can get the main page to load and just trying to adjust screen setting or settings to see friends  or even goto their pages and  im kicked off, or need to reboot facebook. This app. is a totally waste of time  until it is more stabile.I reccommend just using your laptop of desktop.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun and easy, I just hate the ads.  And the ads come up with each new game you play.  Should be once for each session you play.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This app is one of the best kindle apps by far. It seems extremely stabile. There are no hesitations compared to last year's . game is a+++. I am glad I decided to try it.
B0090SI582|3.0|&#34;It's okay&#34; and definitely worth watching but save a few dollars and rent it - the story line is a bit slow and overall it's missing the excitement factor I was hoping for.
B00E9A656K|4.0|Just got this app and I really enjoyed it.I find it a little challenging and you run out of gas quickly
B00G9QLP9Y|3.0|Unfortunately this app did not meet my needs as it does not give directions.  The maps were fine but I wanted more.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Favorite Horror Novel!  Always loved this book.  Can't beat free and pocket size.  I like how the book is written in narratives of multiple people.
0671449028|5.0|My son loves this book.  It is perfect for bedtime.  Not too long and not too short.  It became a part of our book rotation very quickly.
0345803493|5.0|The book was in great shape, and the book was an amazing read. Can't wait to read the third one.
B000H5U832|5.0|My son loves this movie.  It is very cute.  It was one of his favorites for a few months, but now he only likes the toys.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Mr.Gladwell has the unique ability to look at things from a different perspective, which forces the reader to  become a critical thinker. I use many of his observations in my classes on the University level and my education classes.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars because I read the back of the dvd and they have a lot of extras and it seems like any Bob Marley fan would really enjoy this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was an awesome book and I love it like crazy and my brother loves Katniss. Keep recruiting sky army!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Mark Greaney is developing very well as a classic Tom Clancy style writer.  He gives us a great novel with Command Authority.  It is written with good detail, lots of action, lots of references to previous adventures that Jack Ryan has been involved in and that his son Jack, Jr. is now starting to discover in his own right.  The writing is crystal clear, spot on in regards to intelligence work and totally believable.  The action doesn't let up from the beginning to the end.  The Clancy Franchise continues to give us great novels to read written by those whom Tom was mentoring and developing.  We miss Tom, but his style lives on through the writing of people such as Marek Greaney.<br /><br />In this story the Campus is still on hiatus because of the leaks within it's organization and / or the government.  The operatives are all sitting on the sidelines waiting for the order to go back to work.  Caruson, Clark, Chavez and Driscoll are working hard to keep their talents and skills honed to a fine point.  But without somewhere to point their energies they are frustrated.<br /><br />Jack Ryan, Jr. on the other hand is in the United Kingdom where he is back to working as a financial analyst and doing a bit of Intelligence work on the side.  He is bored.  He is frustrated.  He wants back in the action just like the rest of the Campus group.<br /><br />In the course of his work he will come across material that will lead him to delve back into his father's adventures and tie them together to current events to come up with a grip on the current Russian crisis that might cause the world to change as we know it.<br /><br />How will he take that info and put it to use?  How will his dad, who is in his second term as President take this material and use it to win the day?  Will The Campus get back on it's feet and the operatives get back into the game?<br /><br />I started reading as soon as I could and found that I was unable to put the book down.  I just kept wanting to know how things were going to work out.  I wanted to know how Jack, Jr. was going to handle the pressures of intelligence work.  I wanted to know if World War III was around the corner and whether the Russians were going to take back control of their many nations that spun off at the end of the cold war.  Will natural resources really be the thing that destroys us?<br /><br />I loved the book.  I loved the fact that Greaney has learned enough and grown enough to give us continued good reading material in the long line of Clancy novels.<br /><br />Thanks Tom for helping young writers get going.<br /><br />Thanks Mark for keeping the thrill alive.ow things were going to work out.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book just held me.  It didn't entertain me, it transported me to Himmell Street and I felt part of the story.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is the best Sherlock! The acting, the direction and the use of current technology all make this version delicious to watch.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|I got this due to my increasing fasincation with Benedict Cumberbatch.  Having watched Sherlock over and over again until I could almost quote it word for word, I thought it was time to get something else.  It's a great, kind of old time, spy movie.  The cast is all superb, especially Gary Oldman.  I hope at some point, they are able to make the other two, I think, books into movies with these actors.  Cumberbatch had a good supporting role and did an excellent job, as always.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Great to see Sherlock is back! The BBC does it again! This season is just as good as season one!
B000FCKC4C|1.0|Honestly...I don't get it.<br /><br />Yeah, there's great lessons. Yeah, there's a journey.<br /><br />But why? It seems like the entire point of the book is to tell you &#34;Sometimes you need to leave home to find yourself to realize you need to go back home only to go out and be with what you found when you weren't home.&#34;<br /><br />The main character? Bland.<br />His great mentors? Bland.<br />His girl? Oh wow, she's pretty! And...oh...she's just pretty.<br /><br />It's a campfire story turned into a novel. It's that simple. If someone told me to this at a campfire, I would be into it.<br /><br />Until it went on for five hours and nothing really happened.<br />Then I would tell the person to shut up and pass me a marshmallow.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|This product was not every day functional.  It gives minimumal info and will not enlarge a given date.  Did not help.  Was not a one look process.
B00EXVZZE8|4.0|It is a great game but after i lose it crashes if you could fix thay i'll give the game five stars.
B005PK56TA|5.0|really liked it i thnk imma keep following the next season, brilliant script, characters with depth and scary as s***.
B000XPOB0M|5.0|It was great and it's very suspenseful without being gory!  David Morrissey is a terrific actor!  :-)  I recommend this movie
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Great movie.  The grandkids loved the video.  Watched it two times in a row.  They also had fun with the eggs.  We had races.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Really light, easy to learn play during dinner with the kids kinda game.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is little strategy - mainly probabilities - and mostly luck.  Totally worth the 10 bucks I spent on it.
0385351399|4.0|Really fast read.  Well written and tight.  The ending was ehh, as some have said.  I think, though, that some others might just be disappointed in the way it ended but I do agree it was pretty abrupt.  Would have liked to see a little bit more development at the end. The rest of the book, however, was really enjoyable and worth picking up.
B00FR0GT9Y|2.0|Tom, what have you done? In the late 1980's I bought my first CD player. Then I bought my first CD: Boston - Third Stage. To this day it's still my favorite album of all time. What happened Tom? Where are the pounding, thundering drums? Where is the screaming guitars?<br /><br />I understand that bands change over time, as did Van Halen and Aerosmith, but in their cases, change was noteworthy. Life. Love & Hope is not change, it's a total flop. Again, where are the crashing drums? Where are the screaming guitar solos? I know Brad is no longer with us, but this is NOT Boston, it's some sort of Sholtz-like sound-alike band that is so poor that it make me want to cry.<br /><br />I LOVE Boston, I've listened to them religiously for over thirty years, but this album is terrible. The drums sound like a cheap soundtrack and there is a severe lack of passion in any of the songs. It HURTS me to give such a negative review to a much-beloved band, but I have to be honest. This album sucks, sorry to say.
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|This.is.a.must.have.  I totally LOVE my Daryl.  I love that he is so much larger then the other action figures (you can actually see him)  I haven't taken him out of the box yet (he just arrived).  You must get him.<br /><br />Update:  Finally removed him from box.  Like others have mentioned, crossbow does not fit in his hands like on the box and stock images; poncho does not fit over his head (and I am certainly NOT going to remove the his head)  poor quality control on those two issues.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|How can two opposites reside in the same place.  Just as in human beings, they do.  Only words can convey and explain these opposites coexistence.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|dragonvale is the best dragon game you can ever find. you hatch cute and huge dragons and also get legendary dragons. I completely recommend it to all people. there are some flaws like taking forever to get gems but besides that incredible game.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|One of the top albums of ALL TIME.  I never get tired of listening to it even though it must be 20 years old.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm giving it four stars because the book intrigued me, but also feeled me with a sense of dread as I read it. Using two narrators allowed us to learn more about Four's character, but I did not like the transformation that seemed to take place in his character from strong to weak even though the technique further applied Roth's formula for dynamic characters. The author disturbed and dissapointed me with this book's ending. I don't want to spoil the ending, but be prepared to be upset.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so amazing i love it so much i can read this book until life is gone from me!
0440246210|5.0|Purchased this for a friend who loves John Grisham and his books. Could not have been happier! As i was looking it over i now am wanting one for myself! Lot's of stories inside and they look to be very good and well written. A+ in MY BOOK! Thank-You!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My grandchildren, even the boys, watch this movie frequently. It is the go-to movie when we are in the vehicle. It is a classic, well-done, with appealing main characters.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Rachel Joyce has done a wonderful job of characterization, and her writing is finely crafted.  This has been a wonderful and heart-warming adventure.
B000002KB8|5.0|If you like the blues and you like Luficer, you'll definitely like this music. It's like Creedence Clearwater was banged by a giant red devil and had a child. In &#34;Wizard&#34; there's even the use of a harmonica, though it echoes coldly like it came from a crevice leading to the pits of hell.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very interesting movie about people meeting new people in another country.  It was funny, sad and inspiring and I will watch it again.
B003FXCSNQ|4.0|A masterpiece of distopian sci-fi, which translated to the screen as &#34;Bladerunner&#34;, shows another possible (?) look into our future.
1849905789|5.0|I think I am in love with this cookbook.  I actually want to write a letter to Rick Stein and tell him that he has finally nailed down true authentic home cooked meals with this book.  Everyone mildly interested in Indian Cuisine should own this book in their repertoire.<br />if you are looking for heavy milk based dishes, they are not in here, instead you will find great seafood, meat and poultry dishes that are quite easy to make as long as you have the ingredients AND the photography and anecdotes he shares are great too.
B009IU6BIS|4.0|Who couldn't like another National Lampoon movie with Chase and D'Angelo? It's a classic around Christmas Time. It is camp, and Randy Quaid still doesn't do his role justice, but hey...it's National Lampoon. It's not an Academy Award winner, it's a fun movie.
B005JR47R6|4.0|It was bittersweet since it was the last season.  Watching again made me remember how good this program really was!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely love these books.  While I do not see a problem with 11-12 and older children reading them I absolutely DO NOT think younger kids should be reading these books or watching the movies.  I understand it is fiction BUT they're about children entering a ring to kill eachother.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Pentatonix performs their creative arrangements on a professional level, which I really appreciate. The recording is also done very well, although I DO wish it was available as a CD.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Sorry Tom, I loved the first 2 albums but.....Without Brad Delp and with a really bad drum machine??? Really, it's sad.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am a college student and I am very busy. I love sitting down and learning a new language on my free time. I have learned  so much in only a few days and I am eager to keep going I LOVE DUO LINGO!!!
B0065AVWGU|4.0|Film Noir at its best and in the traditional Black & White. &#34;Oh, what a tangle web we weave when we practice to deceive,
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I have enjoyed the Assassin series very much.  Have followed from these to the Tawny man and onto the Rainwilds.
0156027321|5.0|This book is a must read by everyone. It is in the vein of Richard Bach's Illusions, or Herman Hess's Siddhartha. A youth on a trip through time having a miraculous journey.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Overall a quality app, and at free, hard to beat. The downside is not large enough to warrant a reduction in score.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a poignant story that shows the anxiety and suffering of the ordinary German people under the Hitler regime. I am looking forward to seeing the movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is great for fitting all of my camera gear and other items I may want on a day hike or short trip. It was way cheaper than the cannon backpack but it essentially is the same thing just without the cannon name - which is honestly a bonus to not attract potential theifs. This is a great buy!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is easy but still a challenge. Good game to keep busy with when waiting in doctor's office or whatever.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Good graphics and great game play. Its hole in one style and probably the best out there and great time killer
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|This is a great story with great actors.You couldnt ask for more but definately wanted more. You will watch it again.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|What is not to love about watching The Big Bang Theory.  Great cast, great writers.  Always worth watching.  Fantastic viewing!
1439177791|5.0|Are you a female?<br />Are you a male trying to understand a female with an eating disorder?<br />Are you a parent/friend/sibling entirely perplexed by how your child/friend/sister/brother &#34;got&#34; an eating disorder?<br /><br />If you answered yes to ANY of the aforementioned questions, then BUY THIS BOOK.
B003L77G6A|5.0|What is not to love about watching The Big Bang Theory.  Great cast, great writers.  Always worth watching.  Fantastic viewing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use and with the audio version of the King James it made my day!!<br />Will recommend it to all people wanting an easy access to Gods word.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What is not to love about watching The Big Bang Theory.  Great cast, great writers.  Always worth watching.  Fantastic viewing!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|It's not worth your money you play as both sides  it's an ok game it's not what I expected but overall 3 stars
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love Big Bang Theory. When I met my wife she turned me on to it, she loves it as well and this season is the funniest yet, no doubt!
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I've been a huge Cornwell fan since I read Body Farm; I have managed to buy every book she has written since that time. There was one about an island I just couldn't slog through. This one was rough starting in that it seems we go through every thought she has and every word she says. The crime often feels an afterthought. I will still continue to buy her books hoping they go back to the quality of Postmortem.
B00F880BWG|5.0|The writers know how to keep me viewing.  I started watching The Walking Dead thinking I'd give it a try but not expecting to be hooked!  The mid-season finale was HORRID and sad and amazing.  The character development is astounding.  It is one of the best shows on TV ever!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I watch this series when it first air. I love the actress that play Camaron. Love the series them and love it now.
0066620996|5.0|This book took our small business on a new road to great.  This is a must read if you have any business of any size.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|This is a difficult to get extraordinary movie that mirrors Chazz Palminteri's life. I've seen this movie several times and had to finally get my own personal copy. In fact, As a huge fan who also grew up in the Bronx (in my case South Bronx, and not the Italian-American neighboorhood of the Belmont section of the Bronx), I can identify with Chazz. I went in another direction and, however, became a physician. I was also prompted to obtain this DVD after more recently seeing Palminteri in his traveling&#34; one-man exposition and show featuring all key 35 characters from &#34;A Bronx Tale,&#34; (I saw this in Baltimore, Md in November, 2013). To briefly recap the story - Palminteri's semi-autobiographical script for &#34;A Bronx Tale&#34; follows an Italian-American teenager in the Bronx who navigates his way between two major role models: his hardworking and honest bus driver father and a smooth-talking crime boss...<br />BTW, The DVD vendor/Angelo was prompt with shipment, was more than competitively priced for this product, and sent the DVD well-packaged, and protected. Now, back to the movie!
7883708813|1.0|The description says &#34;mandarin Chinese Edition&#34;.  MANDARIN refers to (a specific dialect of) the SPOKEN LANGUAGE and (Simplified or Traditional) CHINESE refers to the WRITTEN language.  The only thing Chinese about this is the packaging and the DVD menus (there is an option to change the menu text to Chinese).  All of the film's dialog is in English.  Therefore this should be called Simplified or Traditional Chinese Menu Edition.  I purchased an entire (region free) player just to be able to play this PAL format disc only to find out it's in English NOT Mandarin.  I wanted this for my bi-lingual daughter so she could hear the story in Mandarin.  Really, who cares about menu language?  how hard is it to press PLAY? .  Since there is NO spoken Mandarin on this disk the term Mandarin SHOULD NOT BE USED  int he description.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Loving this album! Very unique sound! Wanted something upbeat for my workouts and this was great! I would suggest this album to anybody and everybody!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|what could I possibly say that has not already been said about this film?  it's classic for a reason.  the &#34;music machine&#34; feature of the dvd enables selection and playback of only the music scenes... perfect for little ones who love the music but are not yet mature enough for the other content.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Kept you going most of movie....Twist of the plot throughout movie from start to finish.....Arnold Schwarzenegger still cant act well
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|WAKING THE FALLEN is BY FAR the best album from A7X!!!!!! I really like their albums like CITY OF EVIL and NIGHTMARE, but this one is TOTALLY RAW METAL with HEAVY riffs a la PANTERA, and the singer M. Shadows screams and growls like there´s no tomorrow......This is a great band, and this is their rawest, heaviest album.....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!WELL DONE!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved every one of the five books. Three in paperback and the last two on Kindle. Now I am sad that I am almost done .
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book swept me through a full arc of emotions: laughed out loud, cried, held my hand tightly over my heart reading about forgiveness, horrified by unspeakable actions, touched by kindness and beauty.  What is it like to read such a full story?  Wonderful. The characters are familiar, new and clear.  Thank you John Grisham.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This movie shows what can happen when we give up our rights for &#34;safety and security&#34; to the government. The government way oversteps their bounds and the people become prisoners. Excellent teaching tool for use with a younger generation in teaching about freedom, rights, and slavery.
B00DMKFN34|5.0|It was exactly what my daughter wanted ,  and she really loved watching it in 3D with our sony blue-ray 3D DVD player
B00FEN58KA|2.0|There is not a single doll that acknowledges Elsa being queen in the movie. I don't think this was accidental.<br /><br />Your move, Disney.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|When i was waiting nd waiting for it to come out i was really excited  it came out but when i got to the level 25 it just freeze on my tablet but i still love this game om my phone.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my grandson age 3 loves to play this app.he is learning alot. this is a good learning game love to see him smile.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I thought this movie was ok, but nothing to write home about. I would recommend seeing it as it wasn't bad, but there are better movies out there.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Hard to put down. Very good read. Characters and plot were well conceived and measured up to the usual quality of a Grisham novel.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this backpack being as it is called a &#34;laptop backpack&#34;. I didn't expect it to be as durable as it is. My 17&#34; laptop fits comfortably inside and there is plenty of room for anything else I need to carry around with me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a durable and stylish 17&#34; laptop backpack...
055358894X|1.0|When I watch a movie, if I am not into it by 20 or 30 minutes into a 2 hour film, I turn it off - if I am not into a book at the 20-25% mark, I also quit reading - this happened to me on this novel.<br /><br />It is not the style, because I have reads books with time jumps, and flashbacks to tell the story.<br /><br />It is not the anti-hero Thief character - I have read a hundred of those.<br /><br />and, it is not the Fantasy setting, because I read and write in the Fantasy genre.<br /><br />My issue with this story is Locke Lamora - I don't care about him. I have no reason to care about him - I don't even like him, not even a little - the concept of this book sounded great, and positive reviews made me invest in it, but seriously, I have very little time in my life to waste on a book that has as much substance as eating sugar packets -<br /><br />I will not say that I wanted to like this, because I want to enjoy every book I read, and I will put away the ones that I do not enjoy - this has been added to the list of wasted days.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I had never read Alcott but I love the classics so I downloaded this to my kindle and started with Little Women and I've read all the stories in this collection and have enjoyed them all. Every girl should read these stories, even in our modern world the morals taught in them endure. I recommend this to all
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So happy the kindle has this app. My computer is broken so I couldn't go on it to play it on Facebook. So now I can play it here
B001974DG0|5.0|One of my all time favorite Koontz stories, I got this kindle verson so that I'll have this book with me where ever I go. I've read this dozens of times and will dozens more because it's such a good story.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I really enjoy altering images with this. The ease of this app is nice and my 8 year old uses it with ease as well.<br /><br />BUT.....<br />They can't get the camera to take upright pictures? We have to use a separate app to take pictures then use this app to alter it. Yes I could use an entirely different app to do both but I like the presets this app has.
B000683VI4|5.0|I laughed, I cried This is one of the best love stories ever, I have to rate it as one of my top three favorite movies. I recommend this to every woman and if the guys will sit still long enough they will love it too.
B00CM7FLZ8|1.0|I try to open the app, but it just says it has stopped working. Please fix<br /><br />On Samsung Galaxy S4
B00H1O47D4|4.0|Spoilers ahead...<br /><br />The season finale for season four is JUST so incredibly sad! It was just HEARTBREAKING when Rick and Carl found the empty baby carrier with blood on it.<br /><br />Amoung the dead are Hershell (not Hershell! Such a good man), the Governer's 'little girl' (who would havebeen alive if if he had not gone after the prison), probably the other two members of his 'family', and most if not all of the entire group he headed.<br /><br />There is just a profound sadness about all of this. Just about everything in the human condition is dealt with, from child abuse (the Governer's Dad beat him) and the way that this impacts violence in the larger world, to war, to the way humans destroy their own environment, to the way that wiser voices are not listened too. How can you cope with overwhelming trauma and the need to survive??<br /><br /> TWD first season was the standard-excellent TV. It was still good TV until the start of season 4. Suddenly characters were manipulated without any justification or emotional integrity in order to support plot and scenes which the writers had in mind. Meaningless killing and gore for the sake of gore-not with any style or purpose. I saw characters EXPLAINING who they were, and of course, if they were new, they would be dead by the hour's end. It was so PREDICTABLE!<br /><br />I'm hoping that the next season will be good. They really should have started season 4 with the episodes on the Governer and just gone from there, IMO.<br /><br />I don't understand why suddenly we have so many deaths of main characters. Are<br />actors contracts coming up for negotiation or something?<br /><br />I think it really IS kind of low to just suddenly kill off Andrea, have Carol leave, and then see both the baby and Hershell die. I get the feeling that they wanted to go to a different place and story and did not take the time to get there in a classy way. The new showrunner is NOT impressing me. It seems to always be about money, notabout quality.<br /><br />btw, since it is such a rare thing, I have to give huge credit to Breaking Bad for keeping it's integrety ALL the way through to the END!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show, keeps you wanting more. The storylines are fresh and the characters are interesting.  I always look forward to the new season.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Enjoyable theme song sung by Adele fitting for a double 07 movie having plenty of action under impossible situations around the world.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show, keeps you wanting more. The storylines are fresh and the characters are interesting.  I always look forward to the new season.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|sweet this game is awesome.So much fun it is the greatest game ever . It makes me want a million games like this.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Better than season one. Not all sex and violence. Actually delves into complex power struggle in Europe. Liked Thomas Moore portrayal.
B000T433CO|4.0|Just a real feel good holiday movie! Great performances by an excellent cast! We all loved it! It makes you laugh and cry...
B000U6BT40|5.0|This is one of the reasons I watch tv. Lighthearted inventive comedy adventure, lovable quirky characters each episode fresh and satisfactory ending
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I love the story line, I have yet to read the book, but I bought it and am going to get started on it really soon. I loved everything about this movie except for Anne Hathaway's accent, it seemed very fake and forced 95% of the time, but other than that. Amazing. Ann & Jim have very great chemestry throughout the movie and it's believable.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|This season turned out to be better than I expected  I almost quit watching after 2nd episode because of gratuitous sex & violence. It got much better as complex politics became center of story.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|this book took place in a world I do not want to read about.  I found it sad and depressing after the first two chapters.
0061537934|5.0|Absolutely a great book. Enjoyed it a lot. If you enjoy fast cars and good dogs, this is a sure 'nough good read for you. Told from the dogs' point of view as an old dog who reviews his life with his master as they travel to race courses together, and live their daily life as companions. There are some Kleenex moments, but it is generally a wonderfully happy, upbeat story for anyone who loves their canine companion, dreams of having one someday, or fondly remembers.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Saw the two movies, couldn't wait. Really liked it, was worth reading, May go back and read the first 2 now. Don't know who I would recommend  it to, all of my friends have read it and recommended it to me.
B00CLNVOL8|5.0|This is a great movie and we just introduced the next generation down to it this past weekend.  My sister and I love the songs that were modified to &#34;church&#34; music.  In fact, once you've viewed this movie, it's hard to sing the songs with the original words.  This is such a good picture of what church can be...well worth getting!
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Back in '94 my boyfriend wanted to see Nirvana in concert and his Dad said no. I bought it for him, his mouth dropped with excitement. He put the DVD in and said &#34;it feels like I finally got to go to the concert&#34; Hes been playing it every night.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. I recommend it for everyone! Download this app today. Its mega sweet
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|It's so Ariana Grande. It's flawless. One of the best artist of all time. Ariana really is one heck of a singer
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's a fun game to play. You can change and upgrade your weapon, and it has epic bullet cam follows.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|It is gigantic make sure your case can hold this. It does cool pretty good but installation was a bit of confusing an annoying make sure you know what you are doing so you don't damage anything but good cooler an get arctic silver 5 because the cooler master thermal past isn't the best
1616550414|5.0|Gave this as a gift to a friend who loves Zelda. She loves it and i got some brownie points
B005HED11Y|5.0|Sharp, clear visuals with updated special effects give new life to this old classic! :)<br />Much better than I expected!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very realalstic can't put it down as it keeps you trying to get to new level and adding equipment and scenes
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Works good for downloading art tutorials to kindle. Was a little hard to find where the files went at first.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Once you start playing you don't want to stop until you get to the next level,or the next or just the next.okay just one more try.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|Probably one of the best representations of the civil war since the PBS series.  And to think this was just ONE of the battles.  What a tremendous tragedy and victory.  You'll keep this one in your library.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Unfortunately Google did not release the SDK for this product therefore you can only beam netflix and youtube from your phone. Could not get the chrome web browser to work from my iphone.  Really needs to be compatible with more apps to be better than the competition.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Are you kidding?  Talk about elements.  Production style, character development, accuracy, continuity.  Heck, technical quality!  Seems like there's a little more tragedy than I can stand but 'that's life' as Frank used to say..just before he died.  Just crawl into this and forget you exist.
B00FQMVCEA|2.0|No Plot, Characters do not develop, short film, disappointing.  In no way comparable to CARS which was a great movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the old John Grisham style of writing and one of his best!  I really enjoyed it.  He keeps the readers in the story clear to the end.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Great Family Classic & No Violence like in CARS 2. Sing along and enjoy with your kids young and old anytime.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is the master of spy novels.  Some try but none come to close.  I have read every one of his novels.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|A drug dealer on the run from Mexico? And a comedy? I was reluctant to watch this movie until I saw the trailer. Offbeat premise and good casting/acting. Lots of laughs. Definately worth renting.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie, I own all of the Pixar films, except for this one. I am glad I rented it and saved my $20. This movie is so forgettable. The characters are bland and this movie mirrors Cars in so many ways and we all know how amazing Cars is! It isn't very original is what I'm saying. No one is going to remember or care much for Dusty crophopper, or the Skipper that seems to have an issue lying about military accomplishments, or the overly dramatic annoying spanish plane whose name I already forgot. I am not saying the movie is bad, but in comparison to the amazing history of Pixar films, the one takes the cake as the only mediocre uninspired film in the bunch.
B008Z9L8QI|4.0|I am in the process of listening, but wanted to add a detail that is not clear in the Amazon description for the Deluxe set.<br /><br />Amazon \\"Auto Rip\\" includes downloadable MP3s of the entire deluxe set, not just the 28 original tracks. AutoRip puts the 28 album tracks plus the 65 bonus tracks into your Amazon Cloud Player for streaming or downloading into iTunes (or whatever you use to listen to music). This is important info because if you have a modern computer it probably lacks a CD drive to rip the album yourself, and this full album is not available on torrent sites.<br /><br />I'll return when I have had a chance to listen to the entire album and get a look at the box set.<br /><br />I also highly recommend checking youtube if you are on the fence about buying this pricey set. Simply search \\"mellon collie deluxe.\\" There are several unboxing videos and you can listen to a few of the bonus tracks.<br /><br />I am surrounded by fuzzy buzzy guitar. Sweet.<br /><br />Cheers
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome and addictive.  This is a fun distraction. I was hooked from the onset. I didn't have any problems downloading or installing on three devices.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|This album has both ballads and dance music to appeal both crowds.  I personally love dance music by Britney, but the ballads on Britney Jean do justice as well, including my favorite, Alien.  I would purchase the deluxe edition because the 4 bonus tracks are unbelievably beautiful and have deep meaning.  Hope you all enjoy this CD as much as I do. :-)
0385333846|5.0|I heard that Slaughterhouse Five was banned by some US schools in the past, but I think we're doing our students a greater disservice by taking this book away from the classroom. Vonnegut always delivers and interesting plot point that absorbs the reader into the story and is filled with life's beautiful ironies. The dark side of the war as experienced by Pilgrim and the puts readers right in his shoes as well. Slaughterhouse Five is a wonderfully written satirical piece that will keep you thinking long after you've finished.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This book was exciting from the very first sentence to the last. The pace of this book was impeccable. James Dashner is magnificent at his craft. I would recommend this author one hundred fold!
0316098329|3.0|I had high hopes for this book as it came highly recommended by a peer, but I found it to be too long and boring. I was first very intrigued by the book as it is told from the perspective of a 5-year-old, I thought I would love it, but after a while it became boring and too long. I understand that the author wanted to stay true to the curiosity of a kid, but the story dragged on too long with his inquiry. I was also a bit off-put by the mother's behavior towards the end and would have liked to have read from another perspective to understand her struggles from her point of view. Overall, I wasn't crazy about the book, however, the narrative is initially intriguing so you may be hooked!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor. He has a big hammer, loses his big hammer cause of his mischief making brother, and gets his hammer back.  MC Hammer should have had a song on the soundtrack.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched the movie last year but I love watching it again and again.  This is a really good movie.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This should be required reading every holiday season. It's lesson is well learned by us all. Good edition as well.
0761172726|5.0|I love this calendar and buy it every year if I don't get it for Christmas. It's so great to see at a glance what's going on for the day...or week...or month...for every single person in the family. We usually label all the characters for the month as Mom or Dad or one of the kids...they love it, too!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I loved this book.  It is  well written and although it is long, it is well worth the time to read it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A great Mini series!!! Love the time period, the costumes, the history and of course the story of all who live at Downton Abbey!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Already read these books once and just recently went to see Catching Fire which prompted me to purchase these for my e reader and read them again. Such a great story, much better than the lame Twilight junk.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|The best yet!!! He is simply amazing. His music is just so smooth and I would say 'addictive'. I never grow tired of  his voice and style! Thank you Michael Buble!!!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|It is Stryper, what more can I say. If you are a fan of Strypers music as I have been since the began you will be a fan of this CD.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|This was a very entertaining and was a great follow up for the first one. I loved it as well my wife, liked as well good movie.
0156027321|5.0|WARNING: This review may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />Life of Pi is the first and only book that I liked enough to buy a hard copy after reading the digital version. I also bought a individual copies for people who I truly care about. It is an easy, light read that will have you turning pages endlessly.<br /><br />It's difficult to get into a discussion of the book without giving away the content, but there is a broad, reoccurring theme of belief systems within. It isn't at all condemning or pushing in favor of any particular belief or religion; but the book, as a whole, makes a rather eloquent argument that becomes clear way at the end. It won't challenge you or your faith, and it won't be making mass conversions across the world. But it may touch you and perhaps leave you momentarily speechless. Even if this isn't your thing, the writing is incredibly humorous and witty. This is the only book where I found myself literally laughing out loud several times. This is the very definition of character development.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I bought it for my wife. She loves it. I call it &#34;the explaining show&#34; because the characters all stand around telling each other what they should already know if they're going to work for the FBI. Other folks call it corpse porn. I told my wife that, and she said, &#34;Really? I don't get that.&#34; Of course, she doesn't like &#34;Raising Arizona&#34; or most Coen Brothers films, and so I know better than to discuss the relative artistic value of film and television with her. It's all relative anyway, right? Some folks like vanilla and some folks like rocky road.  And so I buy this instead and read while she watches it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|ABSOLUTELY MIND GRIPPING, TEETH CLENCHING, FANTASTICAL SHOW! You NEVER know what is going to happen! More addictive than Diet Cokes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cant get enough...my entire family is hooked. its user friendly for all ages. I think I might need a candy crush rehab
B00G21XNKU|5.0|SPOILERS:<br /><br />Great Chemistry! I grew up on Tom Baker and what a great tribute.... why no Jelly Babies???? Why not add such a simple part.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Fun read, I have missed Bridget over the years. Parts to ADORE and some that disappoint just a little but a good time.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I think the book drags because it is not as suspenseful as some of his earlier books.  There is an awful lot of dialogue.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If you are patient it can be a fun game. But there needs to be a list of how to use everything in the game to help you learn how to look for some items.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game only lets me play a very short wail .  then you have to pay to<br />play on to the next level. I am not paying for that.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I really disliked it.  Finished the book as I expected the novel to somehow redeem itself.  Never did.  Plodding , gray, tediious.  Don't even understand why it is on the best seller list.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Beautiful singing and performers.  Very nice orchestration. Love story to beat all love stories. Hard to choose the man to be with.
B000002LQR|5.0|Fruschiante at his prime and RHCP at their peak.  They've never made a better album than this one.  If Jimi Hendrix and Bootsy Collins had a love child in the 1990s it would sound like this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read all three books back to back.  I'm actually not an avid 'reader' so a book really has to keep my interests. And truthfully, don't be put off by all the S & M stuff, after a few rounds of it, I kinda just skimmed over those parts to get back to the story!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I chose this rating because I see so much contention between people arguing about politics, etc. and also way too much information shared. I think it is for having fun and for keeping in touch and sharing your life experiences and pictures with friends. I don't interact as much as I used to and I don't like all the clutter that comes through such as posting picture after picture that has been copied from web sites. If I wanted to see this stuff, I would look for it myself. I do like playing Words with Friends and the Mindjolt games, so I keep signing on.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Fascinating and chilling - it's short of a miracle that we survived the cold war.<br />Must-read for everyone interested in politics, army and technology (and everything that can go wrong with it).
B003LQMZS0|5.0|This toy is a great price for what you are getting. It is good for home or on the go, has plenty of toys to grab my four month olds' interest and lots of dangling items to grab and chew. I am really pleased with the quality and function.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I loved this book. Short easy reads of very well written stories.  This is a must have if you love  Grisham.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book is realistic and inspiring! I didn't expect to get so much valuable information when I bought it  but I was wrong.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|AWESOME! I have read all of John Grisham's books and A Time To Kill has always been my favorite. I was so excited to read Sycamore Row I started reading it immediately after downloading it. I was not disappointed. A lot of the same characters are in this book, along with getting to know new characters and ones  only mentioned in A Time To Kill. The great thing about Grisham is he writes in a way you can relate with the characters and feel &#34;at home&#34; with them. Anyone can read this book and not feel left out like with some other sequels.
B00C6Q511Y|5.0|My twin great-nieces (just turned nine) wanted Ken dolls for their birthday.  These both have blond hair and with the girls, it's better to get them the same dolls/outfits/Ken cars, etc.  (No fighting over who gets what when they are the same! )  They loved them!<br />Good price, and if you are going to buy a Ken Mini Cooper you need to get a jointed Ken doll in order to get them into the car.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is an absorbing game, and fun to play.  It's been around a long time and many other games are based on it.  Like those candy games that are so popular now.  I stick to original versions.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of the most original plots I've come across in years, but the true strength of the book lies in the characters. I am in awe of Jennifer Lawrence's talents. An excellent read that will keep you up all night.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down and lost hours of sleep. I recommend this book to anyone who wonders what would have happened if those events had not occurred. Well done.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Good implementation of the base game with aggressive but not-too-hard AI that makes it an enjoyable app.  The graphics are solid and the interface is responsive and works very well for the game.  Always asks whether audio will be off or on, which is nice when booting the app, and the music is fitting to the theme.  It should really have an online mode though, the game lends itself very well to that play style.  I wish it also came with some expansions...which I would imagine might come in later DLC.  Worth getting for those times you have around 15-20mins to kill and want to be entertained.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This book was a good finish to the Salender trilogy. It tied up so many plot lines, explored social problems, fleshed out the characters evermore than the previous books.  The middle was a bit draggy, but the end was gripping. Perhaps Elizabeth's thawing toward the end was a bit unrealistic.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|When I saw the print version of this at Urban Outfitters, it made the formatting make much more sense.  I'm still glad to have purchased the Kindle version, but the print version is quite small, so it's not heavy to take around and makes a nice coffee table book.  Great gift for writers, visual artists, musicians or any other kind of creative people.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|Although this book was written around 70 years ago, the truth of how mankind acts in a new world rings true today. It is science fiction but has the depth of an intellectual story in it. An interesting read from start to finish.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Excellent movie, Very funny, well paced all around fun movie. The actors were superb all around and each one has a memorable scene. Is it totally believable... of course not it's a hollywood feel good have fun movie. so suspend reality and just enjoy thewhimsical good nature of the movie.
0525478817|5.0|Not sure how I came across this title, I recall hearing the buzz I think and heard they were making it into a movie.  I decided to give the book a shot BEFORE the movie ruins all chances of me reading this.  I was so glad I did.<br /><br />I treaded lightly, as the subject matter can be a bit of a downer and I didn't want to read anything that would be, well, depressing.  This book does NOT disappoint.  Sure, the subject matter CAN be a downer, but not the way it comes across here.  These characters are so well written, I found myself laughing out loud...or ..well..LMAO within the first few pages.<br /><br />The ending is spectacular.  I found myself wanting more, to know more, for there to be more, and yet, I knew there couldn't be and it had to end there.  I found myself wishing the story written about within the book was real.  I googled it to see, but of course, it wasn't.<br /><br />All in all, if a book leaves you profoundly moved, if it made you laugh and cry, if it made you look at a group of people differently, I would say it succeeded in being a very good book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have Chromecast for 5days now. I live in Saudi Arabia. I paid 63$ from a local electronic store.<br />But I understand this the price one can get since I live outside US and If added shipment and time to get here.

B00G1D5XP2|5.0|This is a great movie, with a very believable performance by the star. It makes clear the force of the controversy into which Arendt plunged herself, the personal price that she paid, and the historical demons that brought her to that point. Definitely five stars.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The app works and dosnt have any problems so far. And its easy to use and it has more than just an alarm clock.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The grandkids play on this for hours if I let them.. they love creating buildings and the farm animals add to the fun.. My grandson likes the bombs and mines and zombies..
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book created much conversation during our book club meeting which was great. This author helps the reader to see this situation through the eyes of all the different characters.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|it wasn't faithful to the comic in my opinion. Superman does not kill just like Batman no guns no killing.
B001BR7CZW|4.0|Funny, goofy, and lived up to it's reputation! I think I was the ONLY person in the world who hadn't seen this movie from beginning to end (just snippets here and there) and it was a fun experience!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|They don't tell you that your Router must meet certain specs. Had to return it. Very sad about that. I had such high hopes.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I was immediately drawn into the story. The growth from the classic show to this show was awesome. I'm so glad you were able to have at least one person who came from the original show to this one.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Because I love this movie very much and give it to my friends as a gift, so they can enjoy it too.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I first came to this series by reading a few chapters about Dany in book three in an edition of years best fantasy.  I was instantly hooked. Martin has a way of making every character so complex and human that it's almost impossible not to sympathize.... except maybe Cersei ;)
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|The movie was sometimes funny.  There was a love of crude humor and vocabulary that really was not necessary to make the point.  It felt like a small budget effort where the majority of the money was spent on marketing.  I am glad I did not pay the money to see this in the show.  I enjoyed parts of it.  The script is patently obvious, but the final outcome was weird -- sort of like the writers got tired and just decided to end the movie.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I love this game it is awesome I have never shot a golf ball in a helicopter but my little brother could not do it
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|Its cheating. I bought this so I could take it to India and watch it with my parents on their newly acquired 3D TV. It turns out that this damn 3D is region encoded! Such a deal breaker. I would not have bought this if I knew it. Misleading/incomplete product description.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|Starts off well, but slows to a crawl too soon. I've not completed it yet though I started it weeks ago.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|My BluRay is broken but I plan on ordering this in honor Paul & for his plan on helping the hurting ppl he cared about & I enjoyed the other movies so I'm sure this one won't let me down....
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|this is a great game you want to get it so you can play it soon it will get harder and harder and harder and I tapto fast so that why I'm taping fast ok ( ok)
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I think we all just keep playing in order to get to the next level. I do like the five life minimum that makes you stop playing for an hour or so.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|To be honest, I initially watched this show out of pure curiosity and have been hooked ever since!  I highly recommend this show to anyone that has yet to watch it; full of colorful characters and it has a great plot.  I did not read the book series but have been tempted to if only to simply to see how things unfold.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|WOW!!! I read this book with my 5th grade son who's vision of himself is just like August!! A young person with a complex to fill a room;  I've seen my son letting go of his own imperfections and be himself as August did by the end of the year! GROWTH!! POSITIVITY!! And most importantly Loving Yourself Great Read!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was good read...started very strong with interesting plot lines and dialogue.  I enjoyed the format, going between the two main characters in the first person.  It did get a little long about two-thirds through and the main characters relationship with his sister wasn't very developed.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I say this is the amazing robot fighting game. Hope you all enjoy this.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Some one can still write and act in Hollywood.. Thoroughly entertaining, and visual affects are stunning. Long long, and prosper.
B007HACDLK|4.0|A nice reading book I have read a few of his books. And have enjoyed them very much. I will recomend to my friends,  who like the gender.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|Nice graphics and easy for my grandson to play. also have the choice to read book or have them read to.
B0015AARJI|5.0|LOVE OUR NEW CONTROLLER I HAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE ITS SO GOOD HIGHLY REOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WITH PLAYSTATION 3
B00632HWOG|5.0|YAHOO is the best! I love YAHOO because it is very quick and easy to access and it has a very nice homepage. Additionally,YAHOO doesn't require me to sign in every time I go to my mailbox.I love YAHOO!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Upon picking up this book, I was unsure as to whether I would enjoy it or not. I'd read some of Neil's short stories and really liked them, but I wasn't sure what this book was really about. Needless to say, my fear was extinguished when I began reading.<br />The book follows a young boy who meets a girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her eccentric family. They hit it off, but things take a turn for the worse when he and Leftie unleash something ancient.<br />The book brought up many interesting concepts, and reminded me a lot of \\"A Wrinkle in Time.\\" The characters are strangely developed in that you get a sense that the Hempstocks are almost infinitely wise, and full of secrets. And while they're distinguishable at first, nothing really changes about their personality, and they actually begin to bleed into one another's personalities. Juxtaposed to the mundane family belonging to the main character, which is touched upon, but is always in the background. The majority of the developing was done by the main character. He goes from your average seven-year old bookworm kid to a man whose very sense of purpose is put on the line. The book felt short (but that could be because I tore through it!) but it was a great experience while it lasted. I am looking forward to reading more works by Neil Gaiman.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for either a good, quick read that has a lot of substance to it, or somebody who is looking for a good supernatural fiction book.
B001KTATIS|5.0|Great watch but can be a little bigger round and better calendar u can read  maybe a light for calendar
B00AYB16EO|2.0|It is a funny movie.Also very dumb.The acting is not that great.For something to do I watched it.An alright movie
B007EC27QM|5.0|Excellenteo, great, really good, I like it, you will to, does so much more than hand held. Multi functional ; saves all info to review. Excellenteo.
0385342039|2.0|Just awful. The ghost is truly unbearable with all the yelling and screaming and why can't Lara just tell her to buzz off? So annoying. I'm on page 147 and have thought about chucking it across the room a few times now, but I'm waiting on a delivery of new books so I'll read this until that gets here and then this one is going in the garbage. I'm not even donating it. I wouldn't want to put someone else through this garbage.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Boring, bad CGI, a ridiculous plot and overall a disappointment. I absolutely love Ryan Reynolds (he's been a favorite since my 2 Guys and a Girl days) and Jeff Bridges is The Dude, but they were wasted in this film. I had hopes because of the funny trailer, but once I actually watched the film I realized (like all too often today) the trailer had all of the funniest parts of the movie in it. Skip it and watch one of the actors' best films like Foolproof or The Big Lebowski instead.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|As close as makes no difference to my favorite album of all time.  I read an interview with with Patrick Carney about this and he said that with Brothers the Black Keys had made the album that they always wanted to make, to which the interviewer said: &#34;You made the album that EVERYBODY always wanted to make.&#34;  I'm not a writer, so I don't really know how to say it, but this album evokes feelings and dredges up memories that I had completely forgotten.  Some from junior high.  Some from my first job.  Some from hanging around with self-destructive reprobates.  Some from being dumped by someone or other.  Some from being lost and cold in a strange city.  I'm not kidding.  There's more here than just music.  It jiggles your wires and reactivates long-dead circuits.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Note: Spoliers!!!!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />I overall I enjoyed the film up to a point. It was a great reimagining that kept me entertained and had pretty good acting. Until we got to the end and it went completely off kilter. Superman doesn't kill, that is a defining trait about him that has remained in no matter how many incarnations there are, but he did in this movie and it felt like a huge change... and not for the better. That tiny little moment alone changed my overall enjoyment of the movie to the point that what would have been 5 stars became a very generous 2 stars. If that doesn't bother you, well you'll probably like the movie... but for me as a lifelong Superman/Clark Kent fan, it was a big no-no and therefore I didn't like the movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Picture and sound is great and the bounus feature add to the story. It was like watching it in the movies all over again
B00GIXY4M8|1.0|I wasn't impressed. I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy writing, but The Wolverine was as cliched as can be with the inserted sex scene that felt forced to the addition of Jean Grey that felt like a bad idea that should have been scrapped. The action was pretty good, but  there wasn't much of it compared to the rest of the plot. Overall, it wasn't worth the price of watching.
0545403359|4.0|read the book after seeing the movie i perfer to do it the other way.  i enjoyed the book and enjoyed the movie
B008JFUQ16|2.0|I'll start off by saying I loved the minions... per usual... but the rest was kind of boring. I was really eager to watch the movie because the first one was hilariously funny, however this one had some good moments, but they were few and far between. I think I would have just watched a full length movie with the minions as the stars rather than the so-so plot with Gru, the James Bond-ish action plot and the girls. I would have given it 5 stars if it was just the minions or it was had more scenes with them, but overall 2 stars was pretty generous for overall enjoyment.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|this book gave me a better understanding of current events.  the book kept my attendtion and made me a better informed individual
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|This felt both too slow and like I was missing something. The movie seemed to lag, stumble or downright come to a screeching halt at times during the movie. it had amazing CGI and imagery, but the acting could have been better. Will Smith does his thing and does it good, but his son... well, for me, it feels more like he was handed the title roll because he's Will Smith's son rather than because he was talented enough to pull it off.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This gadget is fantastic.  My old 46inch LCD TV is not a Smart TV no mirroring function and had been a pain when I wanted to watch something thru my PC.  With this, it is completely wireless and I can see whatever streaming site I am watching on my PC on a 46inch TV.  The price is insanely cheap which is another reason why I love this.  NO BRAINER, just buy it !!!!
0812982622|3.0|This book takes place on the fault line between the real and imagined horrors of North Korea,  in the minds of three dispirited narrators.  It shakes, terrifies, rumbles, wreaks havoc and  ends as do all of life's horrors, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  The only discernible moral dilemma is that there can be no moral dilemma in such a world.  On the other hand, for a 21st century piece of fiction competing with the likes of apocalyptic movies and daily headlines, the author has shown hjis extraordinary imagination and talent for narrative.  I would prefer to spend time rereading Tolstoy.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|My almost 4 year old is addicted to this game. She plays it better than I do. It starts off fairly easy but the levels become a bit tricky later on. The concept is very simple: Get the three apples before the boy does. I have a blast playing this as well- when I'm not beyond frustrated at failing...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of games...but did get kinda bored with this one pretty quick. It's quantity over quality in this one... UGH
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this book and I am waiting on the next of this series.  I will be getting it the day it comes out!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I really love this story after seeing the movie and reading the abridged verson. It's so full of meaning and life's lessons with such a contrast of characters.  Ebook is such a convenient way to read this classic.  You don't have several heavy volumes to carry around.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Everytime I try to play it, It froze up my Kindle.  I finally just stopped trying to play it and took this app off.  But I love the game!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I saw this book for free, so I said sure, why not. I started to read it and it was pretty good. So, I got the second book, again pretty good, and relatively cheap so I went ahead. I am now on book 6 and can't stand the series. It is the most repetitive and uninteresting series I have ever read in the genre (and I have read a lot of series in this genre). Every battle is the exact same, every romance is love at first sight for both parties, main characters only see hardship to further the plot (and there's hardly any hardship), and everyone escapes imminent death countless times. The main character is a 14 year-old boy who can hold his own while surrounded by fully grown and fully trained warriors time and again. There are some glaring holes in the story line that I won't go into for those of you who are unfortunate enough to start this series. Characters are completely different from one scene to the next. Sometimes a character will be intelligent and wise, and in the next scene, they act as if they don't have a brain for no other reason than to make the story go on longer. If you're still with me, I would like to clarify that I love this genre, but unless you hate yourself, stay away!!!! I loathe leaving a book unfinished (and this whole series could be put into just a few books), but I may just have to stop because this series is too cut and dry for me to keep wasting my time on it.
0553288105|5.0|Just finished this book.  The characters are disjointed and often confusing except for the last group.  The plot was cloudy until the last sequence.  At that point, it all came together.  He was writing a variation of a Faulkner technique, using vastly different characters and skill sets to explain the problem.<br /><br />The science is what kept me interested.  Wow!  Energy in a way I had never considered, aliens living in a life cycle that never occurred to me.  Definitely worth the read if you like your mind expanded.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I wasn't able to find a button for the directions on how to play the game, the objectives, etc., etc.
0345347951|5.0|Clarke called himself a pantheist, which I suppose is one way of saying he was open to anything.  This book is an excellent example of that.  The writing feels you are listening to your grandfather telling a story with a lemonade on the porch.  The aliens, both appearance and motivations, are a complete mystery.  So is the movement of the plot.  And the coup de grace is his take on gods in this novel.  A masterpiece!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app cleared over 4gb off my kindle!! I abosolutely love it and recommend it to eveyone. When I needed more room this app cleared every unneeded thing.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|most boring book ever.  a book about nothing only good if you like mosses I had to make myself finish it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun way to pass time. Caution. This game is highly addictive. I would recommend this app for anyone, ages 9 to 99' Happy crushing.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Oh come on! Who doesn't love this movie??? Iconic, fun, full of laughs. Can't wait to have my grandson watch it for the first time.
B00000251N|5.0|This is the most beautiful and moving music that I think Neil Diamond has done! All of his work is marvelous but this goes beyond all the others to a place of pure soaring emotion. I have the original Album as well as the tape and CD album. The absolute peace of this is stunning!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Beautiful Disaster was wonderfully written story.  The plot was filling and the characters were well written.  Dramatic images, especially in the last half of the book, kept you on your toes.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Dream Theater is one of those bands that fans often get excited about when a live concert video/album comes out, it almost never fails. Live At Budokon is a favorite amongst many, and the Blu-Ray reissue is a must-own. Chaos In Motion was often criticized for it's boot-leg picture quality, but the sound quality was the best, and it was a great document of the band's Chaos In Motion tour. For Live In Luna Park, there's a certain divide amongst fans: ones that love everything on it, and ones disappointed with the sound quality. I'm one of those that love it for what it is, and it sounds awesome. I'm not a sound engineer or musician, but I've heard enough recordings, and my ears can hear certain elements in the music. All I can say is try both audio tracks. I never really find the DTS track to my liking for concerts, I usually go with stereo. As far as the tracklisting: like other Dream Theater concerts, it's expansive. For this one, it's not quite career-spanning as they don't cover every album, but it's long enough that you won't really care enough to be bothered by that. Everything on the Blu-Ray disc totals at about 300 minutes, while the main concert alone is about 2 hours and 40 minutes, and that doesn't include the six bonus songs. Be prepared for marathon-viewing if you try to view it all, but otherwise it's totally worth it for the right price.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun! Just hard enough to keep it interesting. Grandchildren love the challenge. Sometimes I have to buy the solution, but I can get more coins by going back and playing easier stages.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|I think this is one of Eastwood's best movies, and I love most of his work. Gritty and powerful, and the writing is just superb.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved this book! Both a novel and set of short stories. Perfect for any adult or teen audience. The writing is beautiful.
B00BLCHZC2|1.0|The scenery is gorgeous, but the script is so full of bad tropes it dims the views. This is just a Western, complete with the evil land baron and the small innovative farmer; a man that lusts after his brothers wife; two bad guys who show up to rape the wife the minute her man leaves for town - oh, and because she's a badass Viking, she beats them up but doesn't *kill* them! (Yeah that's right Hollywood can't allow women to kill scum that's just not lady like! Please! Like a real Viking Shield Madien wouldn't run through two scum bags that we're trying to rape her.)<br />This show is a waste of time.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show is reminiscent of the classic horror movies but set on tv. A bit of Friday the 13th mixed with Rosemary's baby. Superb
B00BEIYN3M|1.0|She should just stop. Horrible actress with no sense of comedy and her face looks like a foot. She is \\"movie kryptonite\\".
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son loves this app. He is addicted. The graphics are rich, and the app does not freeze. Runs very well.
B00EKTCQCC|1.0|Downloaded app to help study for final. Has very little info unless you pay $30 for all data. Not cool!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|This is a great chess app. Has all the bell and whistles. My 7 year old even became interested in chess after watching me play. You can play the computer, or another person in vs mode. Many levels to match your skill.
1250030951|5.0|I've been a fan of Rowell's work since her debut novel, Attachments. She has an ability to connect with readers who feel the same way as her protagonists without treading on familiar ground. Fangirl is funny and honest.<br /><br />Cath is a tricky character. Her obsession with fanfiction is handled beautifully as one might expect the absurdity of such a scenario to become parody. Such is not the case here. An amusing scenario is used to portray emotions that many college students have felt at one point or another. Cath is relatable to most, even if many of us might be reluctant to admit it.<br /><br />Rowell's writing style is so refreshing. Fangirl is a book that can provide both entertainment and those feelings of &#34;aww&#34; that embody the true meaning of the genre. A very fun book.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|This things is amazing. So handy when traveling for sure. I was thrilled to find this just in time for my trip.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I think this is a very good app considering all the things in other apps like a lot of bugs and this game doesn't .the game is very good all in all so 5 stars
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's challenging and sometimes annoying, especially when you are out of lives and have to wait to play again.  Makes me not want to come back for three or four days.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Depressing book, endless mindnumbing descriptions of drug use. Picks up in the middle, then drags on again.  Glad it is finished.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Good read! Writing style reminds me a bit of Janet E.<br /> Light, funny, good mystery.<br />I recommend this book, I love having a little bit of everything in a book!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfectly with my Samsung smart TV. You can play YouTube from your iPhone/iPad, and video from a lot of apps too. Works even better with Chrome on a PC. For example, want to watch an episode of that CBS show you missed? Go tot he CBS website on your Chrome browser, and it'll play on your TV, If you want to play videos on your TV without any cables, get this,
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love these kinds of games, that make u do quests. Some quests r harder or shall I say time consuming, others r quicker, but I think there worth it. This game keeps u going, I liked it on fb and glad I can play on my kindle fire Hd, with or without wi-fi....
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great complex book.  This book has several seemingly independent threads winding through the entire book, as you near the end you find out just how all these threads wind together.  I found each of his characters to be fascinating.  Whenever a viewpoint ended I found myself both sad that the current viewpoint had ended and excited to see what the next viewpoint had to offer.<br /><br />While the book has a fascinating and original magic system, magic is not really the focus.  The focus of the book is people, and how they respond to the different situations that are thrown at them.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Lots of action and lots of fun. I watched it 2 times to make sure I saw all the cameos.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|It's a great movie and so much fun to watch. There are great characters. I highly recommend it. Go Gru!
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Will she never return to real mysteries, thrillers.  Am I that interested in the inner life of Kay.  Her meal plans, her relationship with her niece ?
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|As others have said, it is fun once you figure it out!  Addictive and entertaining.  Be patient and learn slowly at first.
B0089LOG02|5.0|As  a history teacher, I was not  fully aware of the plight of the orphans during the Depression.  Kline did a fine job of sharing experiences of those children in the cities that no one wanted.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|The book and the TV series are as good as Westerns get (and that is terrific).  Robert Duval and Tommie Lee are superb foils for each other.  Added bonus for me was the fact that Blu has captions
B007SGM084|5.0|loved these book couldn't put it down. made me want more of Ana and Christian life after. thumbs up to the author
B0013N3DSE|5.0|Beautifully presented in magnificent colour this old movie represents the joy of childhood to someone fast approaching 60.  I cannot think why it wouldn't appeal to many generations - I can see Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter devotees enjoying the fun and actio
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Works well over wifi.  I can't get my Plex server configured because I don't have the access to my modem settings.  It was worth the money for just tablet access over the LAN though.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|Every cycling nut must own this movie.  Dennis Christopher's obsession with the Italians and the humorous scenes with his father are reason enough LOL
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwall always weaves a great story with enough twists that keeps you on your toes to figure out the right suspect.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Can pure art and marketable pop exist within the same space?  With each step through this carefully crafted album, Gaga proves the answer to her own question to be an indubitable &#34;Yes!&#34;  This little lady makes me want to go back and take some sound engineering classes.  I am so privileged to be living during her lifetime.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This album contains musical talent that is busting at the seams! I almost can't contain myself how much joy comes over me when listening to/watch the Angels We Have Heard on High song performed!  I also love how you incorporated in the Little Drummer Boy....The Piano Guys are first class musicians!  I am a tough critic and piano lover because my son is a 17-year-old pianist preparing for his conservatory auditions next fall. Congrats on a fantastic album! Have shared far and wide via social media!
B00F87A7HG|5.0|Their best effort since &#34;Only By The Night&#34;. I've listented to this album almost every day and enjoy it more with each listen. Good solid Kings Of Leon music.
B002VT6C0K|1.0|The most disjointed collection of stories with no purpose I've ever read. Characters are brought into the stories with no introduction so you spend several minutes trying to figure out what you missed and then realize you didn't miss anything. Then they are rarely or sometimes never relevant. The whole book seems to be a collection of unfinished character studies for the Sunday paper written by a depressed author who wants to share her depression with the reader. Couldn't recommend this book on any level.
B00E5N8DGG|4.0|As an old Def Leppard fan (started with On through the Night and High and Dry), I am thrilled by the bonus material on this Blueray that touches on both of those hard-rocking albums.  While I like the later Leppard, it is much more pop-oriented and has much more production done compared to the older songs.  I must say that Joe sings those older songs (and the new ones) pretty well, and Vivian is a great addition to the band, albeit due to the unfortunate death of Steve Steamin' Clark.  These guys can still rock.  This BR has excellent video and sound quality.  If you like the older Def Leppard on top of the newer (post Pyromania) stuff, definitely pick this up.  What a surprise it was it was.  Only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I don't like all of the newer stuff and would liked to have seen &#34;Foolin'&#34; on here.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|This is a very classy and stylish figure that, while not articulated, allowing for different poses (it doesn't need to be...this guy looks awesome just standing there) still screams &#34;steel-cold conviction&#34;.The lack of articulated limbs, while a sticking point for some buyers is, for me, a plus, as you don't get the artificial, robot-like elbows and knees,wrists and shoulders. Limbs look natural and authentic. I have not taken this figure out of its protective casing as I have a feeling that these Kotobukiya figures (from the &#34;New 52&#34; series) are going to escalate in value over the years. Hell, for what they're selling for now, you could almost afford to get one for display and one for future sale. The entire New 52 series figures are very well done, and look incredible posed together. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my Superman figure in the next week, and most certainly will be getting the Flash and Green Lantern figures as well.I would like to see Kotobukiya bring out some more classic figures like Spiderman and Captain America, or the Fantastic Four, at this price point. They would be irresistable!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ok so when this book first came out everyone was saying how horrible it was and how they want their money back but I still wanted to finish the series. So I read it anyways. One person had made a comment saying to skip this book and imagine your own ending and that's a good idea if you need a happy ending.  Just because the ending is not what readers want doesn't make it a bad book. I enjoyed this book as much as the first two and found it to be sad but realistic for the world that had been created.
B00G32TD98|5.0|finally a movie that gave me a little scared like the old Halloween, and Friday the 13th when I was a kid.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I must say that the Walking dead is the best show on TV right now.<br />The season 4 was full of excitement, but I did not like the way they killed Hershell…it was very gruesome…<br />I can't wait for the season 5.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|NOT BAD, ZOMBIE MOVIES ARE USUALLY THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BRAD PUT A TWIST ON THIS .... MUST SEE
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Keeps you thinking these whole time.Once you get to the higher levels you have to think outside the box.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|TOM CRUISE AND MORGAN IN A MOVIE TOGETHER IN A MODERN MOVIE IF YOU LIKE THESE 2 ACTORS SEE IT....... ENOUGH SAID
B0084BMUFA|5.0|it's a classic. Don't judge the book by it's movie. Sit by the fire and read as Dickens intended it
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie is a magnificent revisit to the world of Gene Roddenberry's most-loved creation. Well worth the purchase price. Also well worth watching repeatedly. The actors chosen for roles we've known and loved for decades were chosen well. I easily forget I'm not watching Bill Shatner, DeForest Kelley etc. on that screen. A wonderful job was done in NOT making the actors just impersonate the original actors, rather have them act the same roles with the same zeal. After Voyager's chaotic downward spiral and Enterprise's whole existence. And even after the ABYSMAL Star Trek: Nemesis. It's nice to see the franchise still has many great stories to tell.<br /><br />Except for one little detail. One ANNOYING detail. The box art blurb copy on the back mentions the main villain by name. This is a major spoiler and you should avoid reading it before watching the film.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love that they kept it close to the actual  show. Its really cute getting to build and manage ponyville with all the rave characters.
B00ELOOYZI|3.0|Meh. It's okay, but once you've got the knack down it gets old pretty quickly. Still, okay for a FAOD.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh again succeeds at penetrating my brain space with wisdom bullets.  For those who already love Hyperbole & a Half, this book is a great combination of old material and new, and you won't be disappointed re-reading the old H&aH material since it's just so poignantly hilarious.  For those who have yet to experience the wonderment of reading a Hyperbole and a Half piece... get your butt to her blog ([...] right now and read a couple, then come back and buy this book!  Actually, just buy the book in advance, since I am 100% certain you will be back.  Remember to order copies for all of your friends while you're at it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The book is simple to read, accurate to history and give important information. But even that he maintain his faith in Jesus.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE David Tennant, and I really enjoyed the 10th Doctor's relationship with Catherine Tate's character, Donna Nobel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad to finally have it for kindle. I have been playing on my phone for quite a while and am thrilled to play on the original kindle fire. Once in a while it drags a bit but it hasn't been a problem. thank for a great game
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great app ! I highly recommend this game. I got this not to long a go and I'm almost about to get Black Top!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app. It is wonderful .Also addictive and the upgrade is so cool . So that is why I love it.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I am a big fan of Christmas music but none of my favorite songs are on this album. I hesitated a bit but went for it. I am very happy I did. I like the twist on the songs, specifically &#34;Christmas Day&#34;.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|Great series.  The only thing I did not like was the packaging.  The booklet is made of cardboard and you have to be careful not to scratch the disks taking them in/out of the sleeves.  Also, if you drop the book it is really easy for all the disks to come flying out.  Had that happen once.  Lightly scratched a few disks when it happened.  Knocking a star off for that.  The series is 5-stars though.
0823003035|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and still do, anytime I am hunting for inspiration on poses or just need some guidance for a certain pose I can normally flip through this book for referencing.  Great tool and has tons of helpful tips and guides!
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|I bought this doll for my oldest granddaughter who is 7 and loves anything Monster High.  She loves it!  If she is happy with it then grandma is happy with it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I do not usually write reviews, but I had to for this. This Black Friday was a little light for me since I have been low on funds. I wanted to pick up a SmartTv but was unable to. I just opted for a same size, regular tv for a fourth of the price. I still had one problem though. I like to have parties where my friends and I change the songs. I did some soul searching on the Internet and found this. Probably one of the best buys I ever made. Now I can pass around my tablet that is hooked up to the Chromecast instead of people telling me what songs to play. It does not do a lot of things a SmartTv can do, such as, Amazon Instant Videos, but there are things Chromecast does that SmartTvs cannot do, that I find cater to my needs. The thing that sold me was that I could cast my Chrome internet browser tab, if I wanted to watch a movie on the internet that is not on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. (you know what I mean). Not just movies but what ever you have on your Chrome tab. I am a fan of League of Legends and I host some parties for the big LCS games, its nice not to just hook up my laptop via VGA and just to have my computer cast to my Tv. Chromecast apps are limited but I think google will expand them. They have Netflix, HBOGo, Pandora(big plus), Hulu, and others not worth mentioning. To sum up my experience I do not regret not getting a SmartTV. I recommend this buy to anyone that doesnt have a SmartTv that wants to upgrade to one, or a nice substitute to one. It does need a tablet or a computer to use, probably its only downside, it is not a stand alone device that you can navigate through with a remote. Hope this reviewed helped anyone in the same situation I was in and I wish you the best of luck. :D
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I bought this doll for my oldest granddaughter who is 7 and loves anything Monster High.  She loves this doll!  If she loves it, then grandma loves it!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game kind of freaked me out at first! Now I can actually stump it sometimes! LOL Its amazing how quickly it gets the answers! Its my favorite game!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Acting is excellent, good story line for 90% of series. One of few shows on TV worth watching.<br />Highly recommend
B00GJ8IY28|5.0|What a lovely song from a Father to his daughter and he of ALL people knows what boys are capable of and what they do. It is nice to hear him be realistic and understanding. But I wonder now will Teddy EVER be allowed to date? He says what my Husband and I say our twin daughter's, no matter what &#34;Just come and tell us...and we will help your broken heart, heal. Well done Mr. Williams, well  done.
B000ID37KO|5.0|Hitch needs nothing to be said from me. He is one of the GREATEST!<br />Highly recommend for one's collection, this with Rear Window and Psycho is one of the best. His camera work is great. I still like what they did with less technology.<br />This is a great example of ' less is More'<br />In my opinion
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Read the first two but avoid this book! It retroactively ruined the trilogy for me and I wish I could go back.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast moving fantasy (?) that captivates you till the very end and makes you anxious to read the rest of the story.  A can't put it down book.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|BBC + David Attenborough + amazing cinematography = a series I love. I would highly recommend the Planet Earth series. I've watched it several times, and my kids enjoy it, too.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good Grisham plot.  An intuitive person could probably figure it out.  All in all, a good read.  Don't miss it if you're a fan.
0811879542|5.0|This is on of my favorite interactive books. Both of my kids have enjoyed it (they are 4 and 2/12). I would recommend this book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The author's ability to grab your interest and keep it the entire novel.  It was neat that the name of the book was only revealed in the end.  Love all of his books.
0763644765|5.0|I originally bought this for my daughter when she was potty training, and now my son loves to read it. It's a fun book.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Good read. I usually have mysteries figured out before the book reveals the &#34;bad guy&#34;. This one had several surprises at the very end that tied of the ending masterfully... and proved my assumptions wrong !
0375851569|5.0|Great set to get started with Dr. Seuss. My kids like all three books, although it gets tiring reading them over and over.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Next to &#34;Breaking Bad' this has been the greatest drama on television in recent memory, perhaps of all time. Who knew that period-piece class warfare could be so enthralling? Expertly cast and superbly paced. I was hooked from the first episode and each season just seems to get better and better.
0887431453|4.0|I flipped through the this, and it looks like an excellent activity book with great colors and characters. I'm sure my daughter will love it, and I will enjoy helping her with it. 2/13/14 My daughter loves sitting down with me and practicing on a few pages at a time. It starts with simple lines then progresses to letters and shapes. There are puzzles (what doesn't belong in this group, math, and much more. Great book.
B008469DGY|5.0|Flick golf is a fun little game that requires delicate flicking of the index finger.  Even my grandson like to play.
B00CQ5R18G|5.0|One of her best books... Loved the different style of ending.. development of characters was riveting.. Great stuff!  Very enjoyable read!
B00BC254I8|5.0|I have read many books this year.  In fact this is the 37th book I have read.  I know people who have read more but most people I know haven’t read nearly as many and yes I’m bragging because I take pride in my reading because Jadakiss was right about you Libyans. At any rate I bring up the fact that I have read so many books just to say this was the most entertaining book I have read this year BAR NONE.<br /><br />I could not stop reading once I started.  This book was depressing, inspirational, hilarious, insightful, and tragic.  I have read many biographies and none have been this honest and transparent.  The stories of his upbringing and his relationship with his mother were hard to read, but also makes his journey more understandable.<br /><br />My friends and I grew up during the “Tyson Era” and he was damn near a super hero to us whose story had a tragic ending until recently.  One of the reasons we love YouTube so much was because it was a place where we could watch and relive the old Tyson interviews and press conferences and damn near die from laughter when he seemed out of his mind and would say the most random things.  Now I have more insight into why he said some of the things he did (even though there is no excuse for some of the craziness he spoke).  His knowledge on the history of boxing is impressive and his ability to be completely out of control but also be self-aware is very interesting as well. Even the epilogue was entertaining although it read like the ramblings of a bi-polar man having an episode of hypomania.<br /><br /> I could go on and on about specific stories from the book but I don’t want to give anything away.  Just know that regardless of your opinion about Mike Tyson you will find this story entertaining.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Paper towns exceeded my expectations. I got emotionally attatched and this is honestly the most impressive John Green book yet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game.  At first, I hardly won any games, but now I have the hang of it.  I keep playing it!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm honestly glad that I was able to read this book . This is probably one of the best books that I have ever read . I think that everybody should read it at least once in their life .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting!  I can't seem to stop playing this game.  I only hate having to wait to get more lives to be able to continue playing.
B007PJLUG2|5.0|Awesome, funny, and romantic!!! It shows the differences with the ethnic backgrounds of both salma and matt i can watch it a million times and never get tired!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Everyone will enjoy watching these characters and listening to the voices of actors that you are familiar with. Great family entertainment.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Good game with tons of challenging levels. A good way to spend a 20 min wait at the dev ;-)
B000T412OU|5.0|A very exciting movie. I always love it when the good guys win. It is somewhat realistic in that the bad guys win on a few levels, but in the end - it's the good guys. Shows a strong President, and people supporting him. You will want to wave the U.S. flag. You will want Harrison Ford as President!
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|Fun, but gets very repetitive and boring quickly.  Each new restaurant is really the same and soon the game is mind numbingly hard to get through, only to be the exact same thing in the next level.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I know there have been several remakes of this movie - all of which of good. However, to me you cannot beat the original. Tells a great story of someone who does not believe in Christmas finding there is magic in Christmas.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook, but keep my privacy settings to family and a few good friends.  We have separate private by invitation only family groups to share news and photos.  We have a large family spread out all over the country.  Facebook keeps us close and in contact with each other. I understand my teenaged grandchildren don't think it's cool to be on Facebook now, so I text them, although I seldom hear back!  Teenagers!!!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This movie is incredible. MM does an excellent portrayal of the Lincoln Lawyer. it is interesting to see how he handles his &#34;firm&#34; out of a car.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  It reminds me of when we were children, and the Sears Christmas Catalog came. We spent hours going through it page by page circling or checking all the things we loved, even knowing we'd never get it all!  I get so many great ideas from Pinterest, and knowing the likes of my friends, enjoy sending them ideas to pin and possibly use or buy later.  From my granddaughter's jewelry board, I went on Etsy and purchased her Christmas gift.  It is one of my very favorite Apps.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Quirky, funny, and a nice love story. Just my thing. The writing was good, although being so cinematic it did take me out of the story a few times, as I’d have the thought that he wrote it to be a movie. And of course, he did. But, it’ll be a good movie.<br />Sure, you’ll have to suspend disbelief a few times — a few times it feels like he’s trying a little too hard to squeeze another laugh out of us. But it’s good. I actually laughed out loud a couple of times, and I rarely get that from reading a book, no matter how funny. So, even though my brain knows it’s a 4 star book, my heart says give it 5.<br />And sometimes — as the message of this book tells us — you just have to listen to your heart. 5 stars.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I'm sure it's just me, but I can't figure out how this App works. I have tried to use it at least five times. I can't rely on it when I have to be up at a certain time, so I set the alarm on my phone which works perfectly every time.  I'll have to get my &#34;Techy&#34; niece to help me figure out how to use it.  I haven't given up yet, but rating reflects how it has worked for me so far.
B004S49Z3W|5.0|When I read this, I hadn’t seen the movie, hadn’t read Pride and Prejudice, and didn’t know who either Mister Darcy was.<br />It’s SO funny, it’s SO the story of our times, and it’s SO the best book of its kind.<br />Sure, Helen Fielding is no Jane Austen. But just because this book isn’t written in wonderful, sparkling prose, does not mean it’s not a modern classic. It is. 5 stars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this may be a little lazy but now I don't have to press the menue button on my kindle go to device under settings and then see how much battery I have left. saves time and is easy to use. want it get it love it.
B0031RS7MW|5.0|What a wonderful story. Such brilliant, believable characters, description of place that puts you right there into the story, and WHAT a story. Beautiful. Just buy it, you’ll never forget it. 5 stars.
B00G2KV92U|1.0|Very disappointed.  Waited 11-years for that??  3-songs a barely worth listening too.  I love Boston and have seen them many times in concert, but this album is not a Boston album at all.
1612930425|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. No wonder it’s still being read so long after being written. The writing itself is brilliant, the historical picture it creates just as good. It’s funny, filled with meaning, and the characters still seem real to me even a year after having read it.<br />It doesn’t get better than this. A full 5 stars.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this! It almost feels like Team Fortress 2 with a little touch of Battlefield. I may not have played Battlefield, but watching videos of them gave me the idea. Repairing your weapons gives it a good feel of being aware of your weapons becoming unusable in the middle of battle. Making our weapons miss even though we hit the target kept people from being too overpowering.  This is possibly the best Multiplayer game in history for the Kindle! Great work, Gameloft! This game deserves an excellent 5 stars!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|OK, this was almost a great book. The writing sparkles, the plot is brilliant. It gets you in early, and grabs you by the throat, and makes you not want to sleep until you’ve finished. And you’re thinking, wow, this is a great book. Then you get to the end.<br />Yes, when you read a great book the end is sad, because it had to end. But this time, the end was sad, because it was just a letdown. Not up to the standard of the rest of the book. Just not satisfying. I don’t do plot spoilers. So, not another word. Except, for the greatness that went before the poor ending, 4 stars.
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|I absolutely loved catching fire! It is an intriguing book and I couldn't put it down! Would love to read it again!
B000002KO1|5.0|Great songs individually of course, but what makes this classic debut so good is how well the songs flow together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|AMAZING GREATEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The ending is the best, you will never find a book with a better ending!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics, fun, easy to play, tons to do without purchasing extra coins or gems, those that love horse games will enjoy it
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is a ton of fun, in spite of the difficulty in explaining why that is to others. (as in &amp;#34;I killed everyone in the world, yay&amp;#34;...  Why is that a good thing again?)<br />I would love it if I could access my history on other devices,  but it's good to be able to let my kids play without her messing with my game. Can I  say that editing my review has been frustrating due to the flaky behavior of the editing box.<br />Play this game if you like strategy and have at least a little bit of patience.
B003JVH7XU|5.0|At first when I saw the cover of this movie I thought it was going to be one of those low-budget films with no-name actors with a lot of cheesy scenes and whatnot. It was not. The movie was really fun to watch with some of the best fighting scenes and sequences from several different fighters. The movie even had a comical edge to it between the protagonist and the antagonist that made me laugh. Nothing cheesy at all in this movie either which really surprised me. I loved the movie. I would recommend it to anyone that loves fighting/action movies.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Thought the game was way to short being I finished it in an afternoon.  The zoom wasn't very well done either, it was hard to see some of the ho's. Over all I really didn't enjoy this game at all.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Really awesome effects, brings you closer to ww2 like never before! This app is great for entertainment, because it has weapons from different countries, not just America
B00FHB7398|2.0|The lag time is horrible in this game!!! It's not only between places, it's every time u do click on something.  I found it so distracting that I never finished the game! Deleted it half way through, I just couldn't stand it any longer.  The game has potential to be a good one, I kinda liked the story line, graphic s were good. To bad the lag was so horribly bad, guess I'll never know how it ends :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive it's crazy I hope they make an update so u don't have to ask for request for levels
0307352153|4.0|Great book. It gives me a better understanding of myself. People on the &#34;other side&#34; of the spectrum just don't understand the need to be quiet and contemplative. There's nothing wrong with me...!
B00122BEPA|5.0|This is the best collection of R&R.  All of my favorite Van Halen songs.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes Rock and Roll
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This is an interesting movie.  I felt it was well acted and worth watching.  However, if you are at all adverse to graphic violence - and I *know* this movie is well below the violence threshold of many other movies - you may want to skip it.  While the violence is not gratuitous, it is graphic, IMNSHO.<br /><br />All that said, if the sequel gets the same attention this movie got, I'll probably watch it.  The story line is intriguing.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Couldn't even get to watching one video. All I received were a bunch of ads. I was very disappointed as to I expected much more from an amazon
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Another Family Favorite Comedy!  Great cast and you can tell they all had a great time making this movie!!! Funny.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|I wasn't able to get the game to start. I uninstalled it after it crashed five or six times after selecting &#34;Play&#34;. Looked like it might have been fun.
B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|I was very disappointed in this latest book by Preston and Child.  It was predictable, slow, couldn't wait to be finished with it and almost stopped reading it in the middle. I kept thinking this is Preston and Child...this is Pendergast..it has got to get better but it didn't.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Such a good movie. Its over-the-toppiness is what makes it fun. I loved Parker's character. She absolutely added to the movie.
B003TOPQI0|5.0|GREAT performances by Brad Pitt and Jason Stratham, superfast action, and VERY cool cinematography. Violent, but that goes with the story!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|If I could ask everyone to read only 5 influential books, this one would make my list. This is an incredible book and will provide you with some real twists to chew on. I am so excited about the scientific citations and details in this book to back up the low-carb, zero-gluten lifestyle that is also in line with diabetic diets and paleo-diets. This is an important reference for your life.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|This quintissential &#34;stump&#34; (body parts) movie has become a family classic. It's so terrible, it's great. If you love flying limbs, this movie is for you!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thought John Grishams books had been on a decline, but this book brings him right back up to the top.  Wonderful suspense and I enjoyed every page.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|This book is gorgeous.  The main characters, and there are many, are intricately drawn and absolutely believable.  The writing is beautifully descriptive, especially of the characters' thoughts, emotions, appearance, and of the natural world.  The story is convoluted, so be patient and wait for the revelations to come. This is not always an easy read, but a very rich and satisfying one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game but very frustrating when you get stuck and can't get past it. I wish I knew the trick of getting all the jelly's gone.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It is kind of annoying that with the price of the controller that is does NOT come with a USB cable.
B007KW5MFE|3.0|Well, either time has caught up to this movie or this is bad transfer.  No, not the Video Transfer, it's near perfect, although black levels seem to be a bit lacking.  However the audio mix is terrible.  There is simply no low end...no punch.  The gun sounds sound weak and hollow as if they just used old stock gun sounds in the mix, and deep down within the mix.  This ain't Underworld, that's for sure.  Even the Blood Bath Rave scene at the beginning lacked punch.  I seem to remember the DVD and even the old VHS had more low end punch to it.  The thing is that this Blu-ray has 6.1 DTS-HD sound.  What's up with this release, or has it just been that way all along?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought it was a great story and very thought provoking. Great characters. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
B00G70JQZC|3.0|Not nearly as enjoyable for me as X1-X3 and Origins iterations of the character.  Awkward presentation, that attempted to be more character driven than action oriented, but fumbled and came across as confusingly disjointed.  Does have good action sequences, but I struggled to keep interested during the majority of the film.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Awesome book very informative. Malaya is a hero her parents should be proud. I wish her the absolute best. Congratulations ,
B00006AG9F|5.0|I adore this album! A genuine work of art. I was late in discovering Magnum's music (In the late 90's) even though I was familiar with them in the 80's. (Via articles in KERRANG! magazine.) Tony Clakin's songwriting is awesome! However without Bob Catley's magnificent soaring vocals it just would not be the same. The title track, Les Morts Dansant, and The Last Dance are masterpieces. Especially The Last Dance, that song really gets me. It is a gorgeous and heartbreaking song. One that many people, ESPECIALLY myself, can relate to. Bob Catley's vocals are so emotional. I wish I had paid more attention to this band 30 years ago, but I am making up for lost time now. This album is a must for fans of 80's British rock. I recommend it heartily. One of my ALL TIME FAVORITE albums!!!
B001O03NCW|3.0|I'm not crazy about some of the songs, but for the price of the 3 songs I wanted, I was able to purchase the entire album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging,  very fun and addictive. I also like the ability to replay previous levels to better my score. One of my favorite games.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman read and I am so thrilled it was.  The world created is joyous, scary, and full of imagination and adventure. I look forward to reading many more of his books!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|If you're a military historian like myself and enjoy looking to see if a film has carried out the correct facts, or, you just desire to see how we all wish the Second World War should have ended, then I don't think you will be disappointed. Facts of the film are accurate, the military consultant for this film performed well, uniforms, weapons, geography, accents, etc. etc. are all achieved with thought of truth in mind. I am pleased to see that more and more films are accurate like this, I believe Dale Dye, (military veteran and film consultant) paved the way for that since the movie Platoon back in the 1980s.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King in years, but with the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination it seemed like a good time to get King's perspective on it.  It was quite interesting, and I'm glad I read it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was an excellent movie centered around 4 policemen experiences on the job as well as being a good father.  I laughed a lot and shed many tears.  Everyone would benefit from watching it and it is suitable for everyone of any age.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love Phillip's sound.  The songs are simple and one man's view and style, but he has a style that's easy to recognize, unlike most young people who just drown out their music with noise.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|After seeing Sheryl's interviews during her media blitz for the book, I thought that it sounded like a great book that all women should read.  Then I had a new hire suggest that I read it and figured that was reason enough, so I did.  WOW, what an eye opener.  This book has instantly made me understand women more, and what smart man doesn't want to do that?!  My wife read it next and WOW.  How often do you get to say that you've read what many will categorize as a &#34;business&#34; book and that it's opened your eyes, changed your perspective, made you relate to the women you work with better and improved your marriage.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|An analog recording from start to finish.  The musicianship is outstanding, the recording is crazy good and it is recorded with the old Neve board from the Sound City Studio.  Dave Grohl couldn't have done anything better on this project short of having Kurt Cobain sing a song or two and since we know that is impossible, I will give this a 9.9 on a scale of 1-10.  Pick this record up but do yourself a favor, listen to the vinyl.  The Neve board would thank you.  Oh, also, buy the DVD.  It is the perfect companion to the album.
B003K15IF8|5.0|A beautifully written book about an ordinary life that leaves the reader deeply moved. I will read this book again. By the world's standards, Stoner was a failure. His marriage left him isolated and alone. His career at the university that changed his life stagnated. All he had was his love of literature and language and his work teaching.  And his integrity. We are told he is a forgotten man, but the reader will not forget.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book is a very interesting.  The story comes alive as you read this book.  I really enjoyed read this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This App is a good game for people who like variety. I easily get bored on a game but this game keeps my attention.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|I thought the movie was ok, I would not recommend it it was about a insecure ballet dancer<br />Losing her mind from being stressed out.
B00AYB1TP0|1.0|I bought this app a while ago but it will not let me open it. It continues to say I did not buy it. Very frustrating!! Refund please!
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|Terrible movie tried to watch it but it was so boring I kept falling asleep. Would not recommend this film.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book!  Very well written with good character development.  Even after the secret is disclosed you are still left to wonder what will happen with the information-and how all the different characters will be affected.  A good read and excellent for a book club-has wonderful conversation potential!
B009DH379C|5.0|Anything Queen is worth having. They were, and are still a great band who's music still stands up to this very day. This live show, lets you know how good and unique they really were and are. God Bless Freddy Mercury, he still is missed and loved.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is very challenging and I like it, but you can get stuck on one puzzle for so long. I understand you have to buy more moves to help you out.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|I got this for my little girl who is all about girls rocking the free world. I have to say, this took me a bit by surprise, it was better than I expected. It didn't have me pulling my hair out when we'd be driving down the road, and she would want to listen to this album. Get this for your kid, boy or girl, harmless for the most part.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use it all the time, thank goodness I was able to get it from  Amazon Android apps as my tablet is not compatible with Google Play!
B004QPOVE6|4.0|This is a great show, and worth having, especially if you're a harcore fan from way back in the day. The band plays well, walks it like they have always talked it. Only thing that bothers me is, how the fans at this show sing the riffs of the songs. That gets a little annoying, but doesn't totally take away from the thing. Just get it, have a drink, turn it up, and just sit back and get blown away.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's big and I always have my Kindle Fire with me.  I'm used to the calculator on my phone.  This trumps that 100%!
B004XUD762|5.0|It's Farging Black Label, does anyone need to say any Farging more!! Zakk is  Monster Size, the band is Monster Size. What else do you add to that, other than, do they really do anything wrong? Having said that, buy this, be a part of the BLS Family, and be proud.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Have not taken many pictures but seems to work just fine wish Kindle Fire had rear camera which woul make using the app even better
B009YU6FJM|4.0|Deftones are what they are, and they do what they do. Nothing mind boggling here at all. Just another good album from these guys, that if you're a fan, should be in your collection. If you're just starting to get into these guys, get &#34;White Pony' first, then build from there.
0143039431|5.0|During the Great Depression, much of the United States faced unemployment and eviction from land they subsequently couldn’t pay for; all but the wealthiest. While children starved, families broke apart and the country changed the rich worked harder and harder to get more and more no matter the cost.<br /> “The Grapes of Wrath,” by John Steinbeck follows the story of a family of Okie farmers, the Joads, through the Dust Bowl and their struggle to survive in the false hope of a new start in California. Seen as socialist propaganda which led to hundreds of death threats toward Steinbeck, the novel vividly demonstrates the short comings of the laissez-faire capitalism which led to the depression and monopolization of agriculture in America. Although the novel doesn’t outright attack capitalism, or even promote socialism, the ethical and emotional strain the story inflicts definitely leads to reflection on two polarized socio-economic ideologies. The political nature of the novel during one of the most influential times in not only American, but global history, led to much controversy but also massive sales and a spurring environment for discussion and debate.<br /> However, the political and economic aspects of the book are not the only thing standing this novel out from many others. The parallelisms to the Old and New Testaments are an art form in itself. The countless allusions, from Jesus and his story to the story of the Ancient Hebrews and the Egyptians, help demonstrate the lasting struggle between man, power, land and wealth.<br /> “The Grapes of Wrath” opened the minds of millions in a time where humanitarianism was the difference between life and death. While the values of animosity, ignorance and greed are values deeply ingrained in the human psyche, “The Grapes of Wrath,” shows the true nature of humans, the nature to survive, and survive as we, not I.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Really gripping. Worth reading the trilogy. Much better then the movie version of this by far. Read all three books back to back. Just couldn't put it down.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|The movie had a few laughs in, but nothing is ever like the 1st movie. Not really a movie you would want to own to watch again.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Really gripping. Worth reading the trilogy. Much better then the movie version of this by far. Read all three books back to back. Just couldn't put it down.
B00C7607FS|5.0|Classic. I got this for my little girl, its an oldie, but a goodie and she loves it. I love watching my favorite childhood movies with my kids and when the love it as much as me there is nothing better. ​
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Really gripping. Worth reading the trilogy. Much better then the movie version of this by far. Read all three books back to back. Just couldn't put it down.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Such a cute movie; all my kids love it. 1st movie that my children actually sat through in the movie theater. So of course they were excited to have it at home. Must see for all ages.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It couldn't have been any easier to install and configure.  Props to Google for doing a fantastic job making it (almost) idiot proof.  I have a Roku on our main TV, and this on another TV in the kid's playroom.  I think comparing the two isn't exactly fair, they're close, but not quite the same thing.  The Roku has far more functionality and an entirely different selection experience (ie. My 4 year old son can use it, can't say that about the Chromcast).  However, for what it does, it's really slick.  I can control his shows from anywhere in the house, and see where he is in the episode or movie.  It's definitely very convenient, and for the price, I think this was an excellent purchase.
B00BW6SOIQ|3.0|Strange but interesting movie and it keeps you watching. The characters fall in love with each other and their weird ways of life.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|I'm not a big Daniel Craig as Bond fan, and this one is his worst Bond movie so far. The beginning of the movie is so unbelievable its absurd. Bond is shot twice, falls hundreds of feet into a river and lives. Bond then drinks excessively and pops pills on a tropical island until he sees on CNN that MI6 is under attack. It really makes me miss the old Sean Connery movies and somehow makes Pierce Brosnan look really good as Bond.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|very hard to get to some of the levels.......you have to pay $ to get far.....frustration level is a 10
B00C5R8364|5.0|This time, Forsyth uses nowadays situation to write a great and interesting novel. For thise fans of him, I recomend this book.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|some of the screens are virtually impossible I feel like running thru the house with my hair on fire omg
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have long loved and enjoyed this series.  From the very first pages of Divergent I was hooked.  So much so that I couldn't wait for this newest installment to come out so that I could finally find out what happened next in the world of Tris.  From the very beginning I was drawn to the story of a girl who challenged the status quo and embodied the characteristics of Bravery, Intelligence, and Selflessness.  She's someone who is doesn't hesitate to fight for what she believes in and those she cares about.  And even though she's not perfect, there's something beautiful even in her humanity.  I loved following her journey through the first two books, and this one was no different.  From the first paragraph to the last my eyes were glued to every word, completely immersed in the story.  So much so that I finished the entire book in one day.  Throughout the book, the characters experience life-altering revelations, trials and loss, and yet through it all, they inspire you with their strength, compassion, friendship and love.  This book series is not your usual fairy tale with butterflies and rainbows and happy endings, but rather something real and raw and a lot more like real life.  Sometimes life is hard and heartbreaking and doesn't always turn out the way we hope, and the book was true to that.  This was a top-tier novel series with exciting twists and turns and climaxes and interesting and complex characters.  Through Veronica Roth's excellent, beautiful writing style, her books will take you on a difficult journey in the lives of some of the most beloved and inspirational characters.  It comes as no surprise that these books are bestsellers or that they are soon to be releasing a highly anticipated film based on first book in the series.  Coming from someone who has read tons of books, I can honestly say that this series was one of my favorites, and anyone considering embarking on the journey will not be disappointed.
B003UV8ZS0|5.0|I think everyone should read this book.  Whether you believe in God or not.  Very well written.  Thank you.  Kinda didn't want it to end, but, understood that it had to of course.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|The first half was very intriguing but I got bored after that, not much else happened. Good change of pace in books
B00GIXWHZ4|3.0|I was more impressed with the Japanese actors performances than hugh jackman. His female bodyguard did an epic performance. I also thought he pumped too much iron before each shot. His skin always looked flushed like he just did a 10 deadlifts, even when he was in bed with his love interest.  Be sure to watch during the credits a nod to Xmen: Days of Future Past.
1577314808|5.0|In my limited experience as a human being, reading this book has touched me more than anything I have ever experienced.  It's got a simple message, but it takes most of the book to really start to understand- just a testimony of how insane our minds really are. What I find especially funny is that I feel resentment sometimes when I am reading it because the ego knows that it's true :)<br /><br />Liberation is here!
1582701709|1.0|I have read many spiritual books, and I still own many. Some I agree with. Others I don't. This one is down right appalling. It said that people's thoughts have &#34;frequency&#34; and whatever we think is what happens. Those who are sick, poor, or suffering in any way...they wanted it. They did it to themselves. They are CHOOSING it. I am CHOOSING my disease. CHOOSING my poverty. It explained that the law of attraction doesn't comply with the word &#34;don't&#34;, so if you say &#34;I don't want cancer&#34;, you are telling the universe &#34;I want cancer&#34;.<br /><br />It actually referenced the Bible and several other quotes from various writers and speakers to support the theory that we created our own lives and our thought frequencies control everything that occurs in it...good and bad. It said we have the power in ourselves and can have whatever we want if only we think with the right frequency and &#34;make-believe&#34; that it's real. It actually says that...make-believe. Wealth, love, happiness, power...it can all be yours if you embrace &#34;the secret law of attraction&#34;. Those who aren't successful or have everything they want in life are ignorant to the truth and are toxic energy. Like a genie in a bottle, imagine what you want and it will be yours. Honest to God it said that. It was like one big ridiculous Cleo the Psychic Friend infomercial. Believe in the secret and health and wealth will flow like a river. How stupid. It pisses me off that there are people living on this planet with me who actually believe that some of us choose to suffer because somehow, for some ungodly reason, we ASKED to be the way we are.<br /><br />What about the suffering children? What about the intellectually disabled? What about the injured? The oppressed? The brain-damaged? The SIDS baby? The orphan? The impoverished? What the hell did they say or do or think to bring those nightmares upon themselves? I guess they're not as special as you, right? You said this so-called law of attraction is unbiased, yet you insist you can make it work to your advantage. This is nothing but another absurd New Age scheme. Nothing more.<br /><br />People have the freedom to believe whatever they want, but to serve and glorify themselves and point fingers at others and say &#34;you're not getting the formula right so it's your own fault you are the way you are&#34; is utterly disgusting and offensive. This entire concept is absolute GARBAGE.led law of attraction is unbiased, yet you insist you can make it work to your advantage. This is nothing but another absurd New Age scheme.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It stalls at a level trying to force you to pay for extra 'hammers', etc.  I deleted it from my Kindle.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game has been fun. It doesn't seem to have an end. There are some confusing parts, but I think that's just because I've only been playing for six hours or so.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I am a huge Castle fan and I love this collection as well as the previous years.  Having it handy to play when there is nothing worthwhile on cable makes it money well spent. This review also covers Season 2 which I have been asked to review.
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|Humorous, odd and quirky in all the right ways. Yes it was predictable but they hit all the right jokes at the right times and it was still a blast to watch. I honestly think people make the mistake of looking far too deep and expecting too much. It was a fun film made for mixed audiences and family friendly. I never expected it to outdo Shakespeare in its depth or be completely original in every aspect and scope.<br /><br />The true question is, can you enjoy the movie and not regret purchasing it? For me, the answer is yes.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Too much impossible action and not enough character development or involvement.  Makes me wish for Sean Connery stories and writers where the focus was more on people than action.  When the villain allows himself to be captured so that his computer could be connected to MI-6's network and Q isn't smart enough to isolate it, the story fell apart for me.  Q looks nerdy enough for that not to happen.  I guess the writers feel that you don't understand the ideas of possible viruses and their isolation.  But then when the writers come up with a  trackhoe ripping up the railroad passenger car just ahead of it, I gave up.  That scene ruined James Bond for me forever.
B009WUBERW|5.0|One of the most epic opening scenes in a movie ever.  Lots of action and comedy throughout the entire movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The new charger works just great, but I believe their is something wrong with the charging port. I will call to see what other options I have.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Enjoyed the action from beginning to end. Love the story line and how Captain America is linked to the other super heroes.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's unusual narrator draws you in for a good read.  Vivid descriptions grab your imagination immersing you into this bittersweet account of a small village in Germany during WWII.
B00FVZJYK6|3.0|This follow-up was just OK.  The first movie was fresh and warm.  This one seemed flat and colorless.  The spirit and heart was not there.
B001B1876G|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|not Grisham at his best.  written too quickly and full of holes.  the characters are not particularly intriguing and the sequence of events is wacky and hard to believe.  it's difficult to be very very very smart.  here Grisham makes it sound like anybody with a brain can come up with a wonderful series of schemes.  not a chance.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.

B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I purchased two of these (one for my wife and one for me) about a year ago. The cases have held up really well and look great! I have lost count how many times I have accidentally dropped my phone and the rubber has saved my life. The color is really nice, although I would have to say the back wears down a little bit, which I guess is to be expected if you pull it out of your pocket or purse a lot. Otherwise, a great investment!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Classic for the ages, timeless history, shows Lincoln in new light, good props, sets, d&eacute;cor & costumes.<br />Must for any  Civil War buff alone & for all US History classes alone.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read the book because like so many, I am a fan of the tv show. I am so happy I read this book and it is way better than the tv show. It doesn't focus on the other characters only on Piper. You journey with her on her path of self realization, purpose and meaning. She is transformed from a person who could care less about her actions into a woman who sees the beauty in others. She highlights major issues and inequities with the judicial<br /> and prison systems. This is the best book I have read all year.

B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Christmas came a little early to the Patterson house, with the arrival of a precious gift I've been waiting for all year.  I'm not talking about our daughter Amanda's return from the Middle East--though we're grateful for that, too.  No, I'm talking about the release of John Mayer's new album, \\"Paradise Valley\\".<br /><br />Since my husband Brad's unspeakable accident, I have been left with certain needs--for companionship, understanding and emotional fulfillment.  And who better to supply that than John Mayer?  With his pound-puppy eyes, breathy voice, and probing poetry--well, don't get me started!  So for Christmas, I decided to treat myself to John's new album.<br /><br />Now ladies, I'll bet a lot of you feel the same way I do about John Mayer--maybe more than some of you would care to admit!  Sad to say, most men just don't get it.  I think some of them are downright threatened--as ridiculous as that is.  For instance, Brad is an amateur musician, and if it were up to him, he'd provide 100% of my musical entertainment for the rest of my life.  But as much as I love our John Denver sing-alongs, sometimes you just want to sit back, press play and enjoy the work of professionals.  Ladies, you know what I'm talking about!  And that's when I reach for John Mayer.<br /><br />I know I'm not alone in this.  But we gals are often forced to enjoy our John Mayer in secret, in those stolen moments at home.  Like the other day, while I was shining our front door's brass handle--tedious work, but not when I do it with John.  Or take my dear friend Lizette.  She lives with her husband and their three sons on a ranch in Virginia, raising chickens and squash.  About the only place she can find to enjoy John is in the chicken coop, as she prepares the family supper.  So whether it's me polishing my knob, or Lizette choking her chicken, John Mayer is a pleasure we women have to enjoy alone.<br /><br />As crazy as it sounds, I actually keep my stash of John Mayer tucked away in the back of a closet.  I only have about five albums (including Continuum, which I never get sick of), but Lizette is a fanatic.  She's got a box full of all sorts of John Mayer-- live albums, bootlegs, things she downloaded off the internet and even bought used off of Craigslist.  Frankly, I think it's excessive.  She loves the variety, but if her husband ever finds that box, she's going to have some explaining to do!<br /><br />Anyway, we are not talking about bootlegs today, ladies.  We are talking about John's brand spanking new album, \\"Paradise Valley\\".  So let's get down to it.<br /><br />Yes, it's called \\"Paradise Valley\\" for a reason.  That's a place where John has spent plenty of time, if you know what I'm talking about.  I'm referring of course to his ranch in Montana, where he retreats when the pressures of stardom prove too much to bear.  The picture on the cover is of him on that ranch, wearing a hat, with his dog.  On the back, the dog is wearing the hat!  What a wonderful glimpse into life in Paradise Valley.  It's like an invitation to spend a whole hour with John Mayer--an invitation I could not resist.<br /><br />But since buying the record on a quick run into the city, it had been sitting in the back of the closet, unopened, waiting for the right moment.  The other day, with Brad off to work and Amanda in therapy, I snuck it out.  I felt more than a little naughty as I grabbed that secret CD and settled in for some serious me time.<br /><br />Now, I have a ritual whenever I listen to a one of John's records for the first time.  Before I slide in the CD, I lock the door, draw the blinds and take out a box of Kleenex.  That probably sounds totally bananas to you men out there, but I'll bet the ladies can relate!<br /><br />Then with a trembling finger, I hit play.<br /><br />Things got off to a frisky start with \\"Wildfire,\\" a gospel-tinged  finger-snapper that had me grinning with anticipation.  \\"You look fine, fine, fine/Put your feet up next to mine/We can watch that water line get higher and higher.\\"  I could almost feel John's well-muscled calves and the warm, rising water beneath us, as John's fingers ran playfully up and down his fret board.  There was no doubt where this was going.<br /><br />I felt a little flushed by the start of the next track, \\"Dear Marie.\\"  Suddenly John was serious, pining for a lost love, an unfillable space in his heart that haunts him still.  His fingers still worked away, but I could hear the hurt in his voice.  This was a man who needed to be cradled, and I could tell pretty soon I'd be reaching for a Kleenex.<br /><br />The next song, \\"Waiting on the Day\\" busted the floodgates wide open.  Here John just confesses all his needs and dreams, and gals, I lost it.  It was only ten minutes into the album, but my whole body was shaking.  I grabbed that tissue box in the nick of time and filled three hankies with my hot, throbbing tears.<br /><br />Suddenly there was a loud knock on the front door--it was Brad and Amanda!  I must have jumped three feet in the air, and had the overwhelming sense that what I was doing was wrong, wrong, wrong--shameful and wrong. The sheer terror of being caught on the couch, in that moment of self-indulgent release, surrounded by balls of used tissues--it's every mom's worst nightmare!<br /><br />\\"Just a minute!\\" I yelled.  I threw a magazine over the CD case and stuffed the Kleenex under the couch, then leapt over the coffee table and turned off the stereo just as Brad and Amanda pushed the door open.<br /><br />\\"What's going on?\\" Brad asked, as Amanda glared at me through her mascara.<br /><br />\\"Nothing,\\" I said, trying to catch my breath, wondering if I'd wiped all the tears.  The two of them stared at me for what felt like an eternity, while I pretended to study the surface of our flawless 85 inch TV.  They finally left the room, and I stood there, marveling at how quickly a moment of ecstasy can turn into a bottomless pit of guilt, shame and humiliation.<br /><br />So that's my review of the first three songs.  There are eight more on the album, but I guess we'll all have to wait.  After that close call, I have been trying to be \\"good.\\"  But you know us gals--leave us alone in the house with a box of John Mayer, and sooner or later, we'll be at it again.  So, ladies, stay tuned!<br /><br />BTW, the other day Lizette told me she caught her oldest son masturbating to pornography.  Isn't that just disgusting?!  I swear, sometimes I am so grateful not to have sons./We can watch that water line get higher and higher.\\"  I could almost feel John's well-muscled calves and the warm, rising water beneath us, as John's fingers ran playfully up and down his fret board.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show and good spin on the original Conan Doyle characters.  They still have a great deal of appeal even in our modern era.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Fun game to play, my only compliant is that is suggested I rotate my phone to be able to see the cards better but when I do rotate, the screen doesn't.  I search the options but can't find a screen lock option, not sure what is preventing rotation.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Modern Family,<br /><br />What's not to love? Can't stop laughing. Plan on collecting all of the DVDs eventually.<br /><br />Why not buy it?
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Engaging story, wonderful prose, fascinating read altogether. It is hard to believe that Alma Whittaker didn't live. Another fantastic read by Elizabeth Gilbert.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this book is the best book in the world but u have to read the 1st books 1st I am on book 2 and I love it more then the 1st!!!!!!!!!READ IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!*sips tea and reads book*
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I'm a Grisham fan first of all; therefore, biased. I liked the book very much - interesting characters, good story with a continuation of the life of the lawyer from 'A Time to Kill'.  I recommend it!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Love M. Shadows voice and this is my favorite A7X CD.  Back to the basics of good hard rock music.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Have read all of Bryson's books - highly entertaining and informative always!  Actually ran into a fellow Bryson fan in Skagway, Alaska one time who said her daughter-in-law, who lives in Australia, was also a huge fan!  They're everywhere!
B0011Z0YJA|4.0|Very under rated band that plays some straight up, hard driving rock and roll.  No frills here and that is just what I like about the band and this CD.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Here is the deal with this item.  It allows you to turn your phone, tablet, or computer into a &#34;nerve center&#34;.  When I got this item, I thought it was going to be the same as roku or apple tv.  It will allow you to turn your phone, computer, tablet into a delivery system, but that is all.  It takes your content on those devices, and streams it.  When you look at the other two devices, it actually has apps that connect directly to the computer so that you don't need another app.  I figure that it does work as far as you only have your phone, your tablet, or other and you want to stream to the tv with it plugged in, but in all, it did not live up to the hype that I had heard from the commercials.
B00CRS5HII|4.0|Very solid CD from the former frontman of Hootie and the Blowfish.  Same great voice, just set in a modern country style of music.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really wanted to read this book so badly… and I got badly disappointed by it. The plot pretty much follows Tris and friends to their new life outside the fence but the pace of the story turns really slow unlike the previous two books.<br />Some mysteries are revealed and you learn why their world is the way it is. However, there was so much to explode that the author missed by just killing Tris in a stupid way to save her stupid brother. I actually thought that there would be more books but apparently it was just 3 and that’s it. So much didn’t make sense to me because the final was as good as written in a rush just to get done with it.<br />Overall, 2 stars is a lot… not worth it. Bad ending for a trilogy that could’ve been so much more.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Solid CD from start to finish.  This band is great and this CD is as well.  Do yourself a favor and get it !!
B00499NHLC|3.0|While I like the premise, the actors seem wooden and the plot so-so. I've only watched episode one so far and maybe it just hasn't &#34;settled in&#34; yet. It could be so much more with better writers and better direction.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|Love Lily Allen's humerous music.  Definately a keeper.  Not kid friendly though.  I love the fact she is so opinionated in her music.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|While I admit to being a Downton Abbey addict, the writing is loosing steam. The plot is getting a little predictable and some of the characters are just tiresome. Its still watchable but not as entertaining as season one and two. The costumes and cars and the houses are still gorgeous.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I, have always loved Tom Cruize, no matter what Movie he is in, this one was Great too !!!, hope there are more to come.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|My wife and I both enjoy the movie, as does our 2 year old as well.  Good story, music, and entertaining characters.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Seemed, very true to Johnny Cash's life, from what I have read about him. I, thought Jaoquin Phionix did a great job portraying him.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The BEST product ever!  I use this every day, works flawlessly, I cannot wait for more app support! Easy to set up.
B00004TS0E|5.0|A, great Christmas classic, nice to watch to get you into the mood for the Holidays!!!. Thourghly enjoyed it. Great DVD
B00GIY5OGC|4.0|Our 2 1/2 year old enjoyed this (obsessed with racing). Funny, a bit stereotypical but comical - nice message, all and all a good family flick.
B002VECM6S|5.0|What, a Great movie, read the book, so I really enjoyed this Movie!!. Get, it I  guarantee you will enjoy it too!!
B00GTZN0X4|3.0|Really wanted to love this - our son had been anticipating it for months - so glad we rented before buying because our cars, planes all things that go obsessed kid thought it was &#34;ok&#34;
B00004W221|5.0|This, was such a good Movie, I enjoy Sports, really enjoyed watching this one, Watch it, I am sure you to will enjoy it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Pretty darn good movie. As a non-zombie watching, action watching type of wife I wasn't sure what to expect going into this. However, I really liked the movie and thought it was well acted. Good pace, different from the book but overall worth seeing.
B000683VI4|5.0|Great, movie, enjoyed watching it, have watched it several times already. The acting was very, very, good, especially Jmes Garner and Gena Rowlands.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My son really enjoyed this book series and now enjoys the movie as well. Cute story told in a creative way. There are a few areas where subject matter is a bit much for the age this is marketed towards but nothing a parent can't discuss while watching the movie together.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another King Best. If you haven't read The Shining you might be scratching your head at times. I have reread The Shining so I could refresh my memory of all that happened and it helped for the references made about the hotel and Danny's experiences. Loved this book.
1845761502|5.0|Bought this book for my brother, and of course I had to read it before wrapping. It's pretty much one of the coolest books ever. There's so much information and background stories, and the photos are awesome! Its like a big 'fun fact' book on the behind the scenes of all the our favorite sci-fi movies! He's going to freak when he opens it :)
B001BANK32|5.0|This book is one of King's best. I ordered it to read before I read Doctor Sleep which is a follow up to The Shining and am glad I did. It was a refresher on the characters and scenes that come into play with the new book.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|This is one of the better books out of the last few by Patricia Cornwell. I liked that all of the characters had a hand in solving this mystery. It was good to see Marino, Benton and Lucy back with Kay.
B00005MP58|5.0|Jane Austen at her best.  She viewed her world with humor; the movie captures all that Austen wrote when women were not allowed to have an opinion.  Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy as are the other cast members.  it is a timeless film which reminds women that we do have a voice.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I have been looking for an app like this for so long!! This one has everything I want to edit my pics I would give it 5 stars if you could change the size of the applicator for the color splash with the small one it has it takes forever to do some areas. But I love that it has a smart splash option so you can just do one color all over your picture.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|Good<br /> I liked it was a ok book but it's fine it's is for teens and younger kids my brother is 10 and he loves the book
B006K2WXOI|5.0|I've heard or read this book every year since I was in kindergarten. I'm excited to read it to my preschool students this year.
0316204366|5.0|Wow - what a terrific book.  Don't be fooled by the title.  It isn't a &#34;religious&#34; book.  It is about underdogs (such as David when he fought Goliath) but also about all of us needing to find creative ways to live our lives to make them better.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints.<br /><br />This was another page turner. He creates such believable characters that you almost don't want the book to end.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Patricia Cornwell just doesn't write a bad book.  She is draws from her experiences as a coroner to write factual/fictional books and a few non-fictional books.  One of the best writers in today's world.
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent telling of an historical medical innovation.  Presents both sides to a dilemma.  Interesting and well written.  Very educational.<br />J
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|As you turn the pages you begin to wonder about the amazing relationship and bond that exists here. I think Detective Pendegrast sees a little of himself in Corrie
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Watched this the other night after having a few friends reccommend it. Overall I did enjoy it but there were quite a few times where it felt to me like they were padding out the story to fit in ever increasingly spectacular special effects (really great ones though) and exploding buildings. I think Henry Cavill makes a great superman and my wife particularly enjoyed the shirtless scenes. Amazing cast also.
0307951529|4.0|Helpful and resourceful book with a lot of good tips. I recommended it to other small business owners and refer back to it.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I'll just get this out of the way first; I HATE Tom Cruise. I really can't stand him and having actually met him once myself in person I can confirm he is a first rate #&!*.<br />Bearing that in mind you can imagine my surprise when I actually enjoyed this film. It was actually really good and I almost completely forgot it was actually him. I really enjoyed the whole post-apocalyptic setting and story.<br />No spoilers but I was surprised how the twist unraveled although it was easy to see it coming.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Great show and great acting. Don't take the missing star as any indication that the show itself isn't fantastic. It would be a 5 star rating if it was shot in widescreen - which was not so common at the time this show was shot.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|I think this is a really cute game, even though I've reached a level I can't complete. Nice play on &#34;Rambo&#34;.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I bought this book as a result of a tumultuous number of reviews by respected critics.  The book starts with a terrible event and then goes on to perhaps equally terrible events for about 700 pages or so.  All throughout reading this I was asking myself, why this young lad did the things he did.  He was constantly following what others told him to do (even before the first of the terrible events, including the loss of his father).<br />I never learned why he did all those things...even at the end going to a drunken party because his GREAT friend Boris insisted on it.  I gather from further reviews that this book is &#34;Dickensian&#34; in spirit.  That is not a good reason to read it.  I enjoyed Dickens immensely, but I was always aware of the native intelligence of the main characters in each.<br /><br />Not in this book, not at all!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|I didn't think I would like this movie because I'm not a fan of Jennifer Anniston's acting ability. But I would myself laughing many times inspite of that.
B00F031X62|5.0|To quote the presenter on Planet Rock, &#34;Here's something I never thought I'd be saying...a new Jimi Hendrix album! Indeed, 43 years after his untimely demise..At first I approached this with a marked degree of trepidation, especially after the flood of substandard releases by Experience Hendrix in recent years. As usual the packaging is first rate as well as the informative liner notes.This outstanding live cd set  contains more than 60 minutes of Hendrix music never commercially available on a Jimi Hendrix album.These performances are electrifying and sound fantastic.This disc starts of with the all to familiar &#34;Hey Joe&#34;, however, this performance is one of the tightest renditions of &#34;Hey Joe&#34; ever released. Hendrix's guitar solo is fluid and majestic not perfunctory as in his Monterey rendition.Even though we all have heard &#34;Foxey Lady,&#34; &#34;Tax Free&#34;, &#34;Fire&#34;, Hear My Train A Comin,&#34; &#34;I Don't Live Today,&#34; &#34;Red House,&#34; &#34;Purple Haze,&#34; thousands of times, the performance at the Miami Pop Festival is breathtaking. Recorded by Hendrix's longtime sound engineer Eddie Kramer the &#34;Experience&#34; was on &#34;Fire&#34;!
B001BANK32|5.0|Great book! I read it years ago then after reading Dr Sleep , I read it again. Could not put it down
B0097HSS4M|4.0|It is a great editor, I often wanted an editor that was able to rotate a pic from a slight tilt, this has it with a lot more powerful features. Great.program for the price.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is a great way to see family pix and messages. It also is a great way to share intresting posts and pictures
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game has everything I'm looking for in an action packed tower defense game. Also the add ons are easy to buy with Amazon Coins. For the price it sure beats the first game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Greene didn't try and make it a fairy tale ending. As he put it &#34;the world is not a wish granting factory&#34; and he didn't make it seem that way.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I am not on Facebook and I don't like being pressured to join in order to play a game.  If a game requires being on a social site it should be included in the .description,just like the in game purchasing notices.
B000K3HTRY|5.0|I love the movie!  I think James Spader was great in the movie, he played a great dom  I wish he was my Master he's so handsome!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Nice, fun game. Easy and relaxing game. So far, no problems with the game loading and easy to connect to my Facebook account.
B009H4WT9K|5.0|Deep meaningful lyrics. Makes me want to move to the woods.<br />Our society is so caught up with Black Friday and big screen TVs and SUVs that everyone is losing sight of what being alive on planet earth even means.<br />Go tent camping
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written, interesting story. Markus Zusak is a true wordsmith. His prose is like poetry. This book will be a classic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best Solitaire game for my phone that I've tried. I'm rarely frustrated with it, tapping each card makes each move easy, and the hints are a useful tool.
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|Well, I love this one but it's a Boston album with the same type sound as most of them. The difference is always the way the songs are put together. This one has a bonus track if you get the \\"Best Buy\\" version & furthermore the L.P. version has a short track for Canada \\"Oh Canada\\". Anyway, they have Brad Delp doing some vocals from  from the \\"Corporate America\\" album sessions which is a nice touch considering he was the original singer. The downer is he committed suicide in 2007. My favorites on this one are \\"Sail Away\\" & \\"If You Were In Love\\" with their female singer  Kimberley Dahme, with Brad singing along. One track could even be used as a holiday favorite \\"Last Day of School\\" even though I'm sure it is not considered as one by the song writer. I met Tom Scholz at a concert in the early 2000's in which my wife & I had front row seats. He is a cool guy & it was brief chat but meant ask him why he never has longer albums. I forgot to ask, oh well, if their is something that could be better is albums for the CD format. I mean 43 minutes long for the regular CD, even the bonus track(s) don't make it longer. Anyway, judge for yourself, a very good album and worth a listen. I highly recommend this for music fans and all Boston fans.<br />Drop by my website sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\", always something for someone.
B00BEK6Z7M|2.0|The last several books were very disappointing.  The &#34;aura&#34; that hooked me into the series was totally gone. I had great hopes for White Fire but I was greatly disappointed. Just another &#34;Nancy Drew&#34; a little more grown up. Pendergast's role was comparably slim to none, and the story, to be kind, was &#34;thin&#34;. I gave two stars instead of one for old times sake only.  I'm afraid I have to concede, what to me in the past, was unthinkable, Preston and Child's have completely lost it!  Too bad, they afforded me many hours of pleasure in the past.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Every track is perfect. If you liked hearing &#34;Little Talks&#34; on the radio you should definitely buy this. That is only the tip of the iceberg with this band. Love this album!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|There are dozens and dozens of puzzles and levels in each of four different arenas...enough to keep me busy in what little spare time I have these days.
B00GIXY4M8|1.0|I didn't like the fact that after mutants are already known about and where Wolverine was in the Marvel timeline, they treated the story like they did.  Love most Marvel movies, but this one is a stinker.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I listened to Little Drummer Boy on a Facebook link and the beauty of the harmony brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart.  When I discovered that it is not available in a CD format, joy became sadness.  MP3 is not the only media...make the music available to  all who would love to listen!
B008JFUP0I|5.0|To me this movie Rocked and It is very Sad we have lost another actor Paul walker and he did a great job in the movies and in the fast and furious movies, I find it very cool about this movie and i know they want to keep making more i just wonder who will star in the 7th movie. So get this movie while you can because new movies seem to go fast. Shop around at your stores who knows a sale and so on. Online is also good because no one touches the dvd or blue Ray.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This the Doors' debut album is very nicely remastered. Besides the sound, one of the first things I noticed different was the words in &#34;Break on Through&#34;. On the original Jim sings, &#34;She gets...she gets...&#34;, but on this cd he sings, &#34;She gets high, she gets high.&#34;<br />There are three added tracks; two versions of &#34;Moonlight Drive&#34; from the &#34;Strange Days&#34; album and &#34;Indian Summer&#34; from the &#34;Morrison Hotel&#34; album. They are interesting, but I prefer the original cuts.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love Suits!  After the first episode in season 1 I was sucked right in!  It's enough twists and turns with the characters but not trashy like most shows on TV these days.  I would highly recommend Suits season 1 and 2 to anyone!  I wish season 3 was on Prime!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Excellent story, acting, action. Some parts are really hard to take though they would be missed if they weren't there.<br />Quality of the blueray is top notch.<br />Lots of action, gory violence, and use of the &#34;n&#34; word as well as &#34;f&#34; and &#34;s&#34; words. Brief view of Kerry nude, but this is about the guys.<br />You'll love Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Kerry Washington, and a few other characters. You'll hate Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson, and some other characters.<br />It's a great movie, but I repeat, some parts are really hard to take.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Lots of explosions.  A collection of almost all the major action actors but you get the feeling that they are playing it for their own amusement  often times tongue in cheek as they parody their previous roles.  The action is over the top so much so as to be unbelievable.  The story line tries but fails to make an emotion connection with the audience.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraria is a great game, is updated frequently, and is very worth the buy. I honestly, am a minecraft guy but when I first played terraria I was instantly hooked! For 4.99 you can get a game worth 20.00
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  It gave good solid information that was easy to understand that I could immediately take action.
1476727651|5.0|this is defiantly going in my top five favorite books I've read. The True Knot is such a fascinating bunch of RV travelers and I love Rose as a character. I guess I like the bad guys. Stephen King is at the top of his game.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|Very useful app.  I use this program to install side loading apps, backup current apps and also to unload and remove apps that I no longer need or want.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Incredible action, story and &#34;skills&#34; by Liam Neeson and cast.  Anticipation doesn't get any better than in this tightly-woven script.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Hard to follow the story.  Only 25% of the way into the book though. Might need to start over with reading it for the book club.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Love this game. Great graphics.  Quick paced Not crazy about having to stop to offers to play other games or continuous asking to post to Facebook. But GAME is fun to plsy
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It has some good stuff to it. A lot of good stuff to it . I tested the temperature scale by putting my device near a fire place and the temperature went up!  You should buy this if you like cool apps.
0316067938|5.0|book was great- couldnt put the book down. pretty good way to read book on trips or at home. i would suggest it
1426308469|5.0|This a large hardcover book with lots of details in it.<br />Any kid who loves Dinosaurs will love this.<br />Perfect birthday or Christmas present
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|twightlight is great movie and i really liked how the movie was made- i could watch it over and over
B003E2UQMS|3.0|hmmmm. well it was middle of the road for me. many times it annoyed me. the characters each had their own merits and their own brand of crazy. i hard a hard time getting into the book. just wasn't a great read for me. .
B00F88U4J6|5.0|The moon reader shines for the kindle fire. Beyond automatic basic functionality like easy file finding, holding your place, and showing covers, it also allows a for a ton of customization. Text you highlight is automatically bookmarked and you can share via social networking. You can save font and background setups as personal and variable themes to suit day or night, high or low batteries. What a great find!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  There is a lot going on but you can slow down the speed when needed.  Lots of variations in towers and modification options.  It gets really tough as time goes on.  The notes from the app between levels are often helpful.  I have never found the need to buy any of the in-game extras; it's plenty of fun without it.
B0080R3PSE|5.0|Excellent book that can be applied to life outside of childbirth. highly recommend this to everyone. CD is okay but not necessary
B000069KIZ|5.0|Excellent in audio edition, clear and noiseless sound, this recording is a must. Böhm gives us a clear understanding of Brahms's symphonic world. From all readings I've heard (Bernstein, Karajan, Szell, Mehta, Celibidache, and others) this one talks &#34;fully operational&#34; to my mind and heart. Highly recommendable, in my opinion.
B008MM9630|1.0|Everything was great.  I really liked this game.  Until shortly after reaching level 50 it wiped my progress and started me back at the beginning.  The worst part . . . I actually spent money on this game.  Something I never do.  Also for Kindle Fire, the specials tab showed up a handful of times in the months I played the game.  I sm so irradiated with this game.
1423136802|5.0|I'm in my mid twenties and I first read these three or so years ago. The first two books were a little childish in their plot for my taste but by the last few I could not rip my eyes of the page. These books are incredible and the box set is a beautiful addition to my bookcase.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|A fabulous box set of the greatest classical pianist of our time.  You have only to listen to be convinced.
B006O6F932|2.0|We bought this for our 8 year-old and regretted it as soon as we started putting it together. While there is a lot of great detail and cute accessories, it is very flimsy and won't hold up to regular play. She is constantly having to put it back together. The second level is barely strong enough to actually hold up one of the dolls. This is way over priced for the quality (it might he worth it if the price was about $20 lower). Don't expect the quality that you get from Barbie houses, you will be sorely disappointed.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|This product is awesome, although it should be mentioned that those of us with Really Right Stuff mounts will have trouble with this default mounting kit. You CAN purchase a mount that will work, but it's quite expensive. If you want the perfect set, price both of these items before purchase. This being said, I don't have the extra piece just yet, and I make it work. It's not perfectly hanging like in the image, but if I keep an arm or hand near it, it's fine. This is the perfect idea for people who photograph long events, yet sometimes want to use dual cameras or otherwise have two hands free while not setting their camera down in a public place.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I've been playing on my kindle fire hd for a few weeks now and so far no issues. I play solo with no help from Facebook except maybe sea trading but other than that I don't have to bug my friends which I wouldn't even if I had to. Cute game. Keeps me busy.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Despite the album title proclaiming Muddy Waters as a &#34;Folk Singer&#34;, this is actually a first rate acoustic blues album, pure and simple.<br /><br />When this album was recorded in 1963, folk music was at the height of its popularity. Chess Records wanted to cash in on the popularity of folk music so the label had some of its artists record acoustic blues albums which the Chess brothers marketed as &#34;folk music&#34; albums. This is one of those Chess Records albums aimed at the &#34;folk music&#34; market.<br /><br />Acoustic blues was not a stretch for Muddy Waters; he had grown up in Mississippi playing acoustic blues before moving to Chicago.<br /><br />The original vinyl LP album featured the first 9 tracks of this CD release, featuring material recorded in September 1963 with Muddy Waters on guitar and vocals, Buddy Guy on guitar, Willie Dixon on bass. All are first rate material from some of the leading figures in Chicago blues.<br /><br />This expanded CD version adds two tracks recorded on 9 April 1964 and three recorded in October 1964.<br /><br />The April 1964 recordings feature Muddy Waters on guitar and vocals, Otis Spann on piano, James &#34;Pee Wee&#34; Madison on guitar, Willie Dixon on bass and S.P. Leary on drums. These tracks are &#34;The Same Thing&#34; (written by Willie Dixon and basically the tune to Dixon's &#34;Spoonful&#34; with a different lyric) and a Muddy Waters composition, You Can't Lose What You Never Had. Both are excellent electric blues numbers.<br /><br />The three tracks from the September 1964 sessions feature Muddy Waters on guitar and vocals, J.T. Brown on tenor sax, Sam Lawhorn and Pee Wee Madison on guitar, James Cotton on harmonica, Otis Spann on piano and S. P. Leary on drums. All three are straight up electric blues numbers; all are excellent.<br /><br />The sound is good quality and the album clocks in at just over 48 minutes total playing time.<br /><br />This expanded version of Muddy Waters Folk Singer is an excellent combination of acoustic and electric blues from Muddy Waters and some first rate sidemen. If you're a blues fan, you'll like this one.an excellent combination of acoustic and electric blues from Muddy Waters and some first rate sidemen. If you're a blues fan, you'll like this one.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is so much fun I cant stop playing it. for the first time I meant to bring my kindle to school
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It is an excellent show.  The acting is great, the plots are very suspenseful.  Can't wait to see how it all ends.
B008B68J2G|5.0|Got this set on sale and am one happy mom, it looks cool. I have not opened it since it will be my daughters Christmas present.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Lots of good fun.  It was a conspiracy theory worthy of Dan Brown, but with a hipster twist.  Some great references to Google's fabled culture woven into a young fellow's journey into the depths of a funky mystery.<br /><br />I eagerly await Robin Sloane's next tale.

B004XW6AGO|4.0|Challenging read.  I think I made a mistake by selecting this as my first foray into Murakami's literary perspective.<br /><br />It was a deep, intense read and it took me a long time to complete, I stubbornly refused to abandon it.  The story follows the paths of two protagonists, existing concurrently and separately, yet inextricably together.<br /><br />I can't say that I &#34;got&#34; the outcome, but it was a challenging and ethereal... and I was satisfied with having completed the journey.<br /><br />It's worthwhile if you can tolerate vague.  Now - I just need to muster up the courage to tackle another Murakami story!
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Not one of Patricia Cornwells best Scarpetta Novels.  It was not suspenseful, not enough action and did not  keep my interest.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I am so glad to find an app that lets me print emails fro my Kindle, but the layout of the page is not as good as I would like.  Maybe there are settings that I can change.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing quality and ease of use for the price. I own three, one for each TV and my family routinely broadcasts Netflix and YouTube. Can't wait for Google to expand the number of apps that work with it, currently only wireless PC Chrome browser, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu & HBO Go. Device is still in Beta so future potential is limitless.
B00H1MDH3W|5.0|Very useful app that is easy to use and a bargain at $2.I already use Stellarium on my desktops and laptops so this is familiar.Much  neater and less awkward than  a big paper chart.Highly recommended for beginners and recreational stargazers like myself.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|The Wise Man's Fear does a good job of expanding the Kingkiller Chronicle and is difficult to put down. I enjoyed myself all the way through, but the book is not without its issues. I've found that Kvothe's use of magic or mental state is unevenly used (HoS could have come in handy at several points but he seems to forget about it, only to use it a few hundred pages later). Also, the book takes its sweet time getting through itself, and as such the pacing seems off as you're nearing the end. A lot is written, but a lot less happens compared to Day One. At least, it feels like there are a lot fewer discrete, fun-to-read events going on in this book. Finally, I'm not seeing much to like about Denna. Maybe I don't like crazy girls enough?
B005H0IW6W|5.0|My wife is nuts for Michael Buble! I bought this for her and she's already listened to it at least six times today. I'm not one for songs being redone willy nilly, but Michael Buble has honored Christmas classics and sings them with style and class. This is a CD that both my wife and I can enjoy for years to come. And who knows...maybe we'll play this CD while I try to give my wife the present shes been waiting for... that positive pregnancy she's been praying for.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Literally the worst purchase I've ever made. It's pointless. meaning there is no point to this game. at all. nothing like other versions. It's a waste.
B0081336FO|5.0|Outstanding story lines, cleverly crafted.  Acting is top notch, cinematography is breathtaking. Set in modern times but in no way detracts from what you would expect from a grand Sherlock Holmes adventure.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|Love the game, but often freezes while loadng and won't let me play.  Recommend paying $1.99 rather than choosing the free version, the ads after every play become annoying.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Great, exciting, fast-paced.  Once again I get to enjoy the dysfunctional camaraderie between Kay, Benton, Marino, and Lucy.  What a treat and what human, enjoyable characters!
0307719774|5.0|This is such a unique journal! It helps you think about different aspects of every single day by asking you all sorts of short questions that you may not have thought of with a regular journal. There is space for 5 answers for every question on every page, which sometimes is a struggle when you want to say more, but for the most part, the space is perfect.<br /><br />Like my title says though, KEEP UP with the book! Write every single day before bed! I skipped quite a few days, and by the time I got to writing in the journal I had to fill in 4 days and some of the questions got specific so I didn't have any answers prepared :(
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Was hooked almost from the beginning. Awesome graphics and storyline.<br />Easy game play as well as different things to do. Not your typical game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chomecast dongle was a breeze to install & it worked on my Samsung tab 2 7&#34; after installing Google Chrome  plus cast. Had to install Chrome browser then add cast to it on My PC win7 for it to broadcast from it. You have to have some sort of tablet , PC or Mac to get it going.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|It's a wonderful story based on a real person, wonderfully portrayed by Meryl Streep.  It was refreshing and w/o bad language and violence, unless you count the destruction done to the turkey!  Probably a &#34;chick flick&#34; however my husband enjoyed it as well.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|If you don't play the board game, it will take a few games to get the score system down. Put together well, would like a see an online option.

B0027MJU00|2.0|Darkest book I've read, maybe ever.  I wouldn't want to do it again.  I didn't expect that after reading Gone Girl.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is by far the best game that I have  played on the kindle it's mechanics are easy t  learn and it isn't like normal card base  games which I love.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|awesome game. very responsive. realistic. good graphics good visuals. fun to play and competitive.I do not think it be cld be better.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|5 stars hands down.  This book, as well as The Kite Runner, is absolutely captivating.  His skillful writing transports you into the mind of the characters for an escape that is both moving and inspirational.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading it. Grisham never disappoints. The book arrived immediately in my Kindle and was read as soon as it arrived.
B0035G04O8|5.0|This is a wonderful book for those who preparing to get married and those who are already married.  It was recommended by my pre-marital counsellor and my wife and I still find it useful even today in our marriage.

B000MRAAJW|1.0|I received my order very quickly but, the case was broken AND none of the dvds would play. The dvd player read \\"disc error\\" on all 5 disc. I recommend spending the money, it would be worth it.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I get all of my news from this app.  It is easy to use and gives me all the news I am looking for in one easy to read place.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like playing games and pack man is a good one. A lot of action and fun to be had at a cheap rate
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Lots of action, but not as fun as RED. It did not have the enjoyable dialogue that made the first movie so much fun. Plenty of action but short on plot. There was not enough of Helen Mirren and none of Morgan Freeman.

What they have been doing for years to keep up with this demand. Trying to grow the meat faster, bigger. From growing in feed lots, synthetic hormones, how they are killed. This isn't something you want to see, But it is a must see video. Those would don't watch it, are apart of the real problem. Those who watch it, can and will change it.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It's been a fun experience trying to learn this camera!<br />It has nice pictures and work's best on the delayed timer.<br />I would recommend anyone who just would like to try it? Too!<br />I never printed any of the pictures.  So I'm not sure how they develop?!?

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game. They should keep producing deer hunter. I don't understand why it's called deer hunter when you hunter multiple animals. I give you five stars, great job.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The controls are pretty simple, and besides one &quot;Please rate me&quot; notification and the ads at the top, it's pretty good.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|There are too many advertisements within the game.  There is no clear knowledge of what level either.  It's a fast game but the are other games that are better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very challenging and keeps you wanting to go back to it.  The only thing I don't like is the waiting time once you used the ones you had available.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a fun simple game that takes your mind off everyday worries.  It is easy and does not become frustrating like some other games.
B00G70JQZC|2.0|This movie never really grabbed my attention.  I found myself not really caring about the characters or action sequences.  However, I could see how some people would like it.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|My kindle had no apps on it. So when I got this game I thought it would be fun. But instead it gave me three viruses! DO NOT GET APP!!!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I never downloadas from the cloud neither it gets installed... There's a problem in the installation for the kindle fire
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just horrible.  The first book was great, the second was okay and this was dreadful.  It dragged on and on with people just moping around feeling sorry for themselves. It honestly felt like half was just filler. Then it ends atrociously and I'm not talking about how someone dies it was just dumb and unrealistic.  This series could have really had an amazing ending but I'm afraid the author has no imagination.<br />In summary, if you feel like you'd enjoy reading an emo girls diary this is for you otherwise save your money and get a book from an author who can write
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I like the fact that your hitting the ball of aircraft. It makes being bored fun. Nice graphics as well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have had the calculator for a year now. I love using it. It is so easy to use. It helps me with homework and other every day things.

B00A861QMM|4.0|I really like this game, is different than most HO Games. I'd give it 5 if didn't have to pay pay way thru game.
B00BF124PC|5.0|Best movie. If you like &#34;Homeland&#34; then you will love this movie. It is like &#34;Homeland&#34; without &#34;dating drama&#34;. Love the stong female lead!

0375507256|5.0|Our insatiable quest for order within the universe has helped elevate our species from earth’s primordial soups to depths beyond our solar system. As vastly superior creatures on this planet, we have all but dominated our physical surroundings. Yet, it is the unexplained cosmic weirdness such as: human consciousness stemming from an electrically charged lump of meat, a species’ incalculable set of coincidences often created among each other and played out in unexplained ways, or the notion of an afterlife for our souls - all lie beyond our understanding. These complex and fantastical questions may end up dangling themselves in front of mankind as a subtle reminder to how feeble we truly are. Works of speculative fiction may be the only quench for our thirst of knowledge in an attempt to explain that which we cannot.<br /><br />To sum up ‘Cloud Atlas’ as “about reincarnation” (as I’ve heard a hundred times) would be a grave injustice. It is like saying breathing is not essential to survival; but rather, breathing exists for the mere task of hailing a cab during rush hour. We are social creatures. And ‘Cloud Atlas’ is about the human experience as it relates to others and how interconnected our spirits and actions are as a species.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is more than an eclectic science fiction novel enamored with literary prowess. On a long enough timeline, I feel it will be praise-worthy, similar to those drab doorstop novels, deemed as ‘classic literature’ by academia. It has the literary ambitions equivalent to placing a man on the moon by using a space craft with less computing power than the average smartphone. I have come across few authors that could successfully pull off Mitchell’s keen observations of human nature with efficiently eloquent prose in a manner that truly captures the reader’s imagination and he creates characters worthy of our attention.<br /><br />At times, Mitchell’s writing has a negligible dash of super natural forces like Murakami. The mere notion that I adore science fiction and cannot properly label ‘Cloud Atlas’ so, must mean Mitchell has snubbed his nose at the status quo and refused to be genre-labeled – often the barometer of a classic in the making. Reading it is like walking into a bookstore and picking up six different novels within six different genres and duct taping them in a mildly uniform fashion. ‘Cloud Atlas’ is delivered in a creative Russian doll-styled ‘sextet’ (which is not only part of the story; it is practically right in the title). And it doesn’t even feel gimmicky.<br />Each story’s character’s actions or seemingly unimportant plot devices end up as an uncanny coincident that curiously drips its way from one story to the next. In fact, each character in some way ‘reads’ or interacts with the proceeding protagonist; a cosmic game of dominoes played by the same soul oblivious to time.<br /><br />By now, it should be no surprise that he/she is the same character’s reincarnated spirit. The first story, set in the nineteenth century, is of Adam Ewing, a west coast notary on a sea voyage in an attempt to procure slaves for his wealthy father-in-law. Followed by Robert Frobisher, the amanuensis to a famous retired composer, Luisa Rey (possibly named from the novel ‘The Bridge of San Luis Rey’ with a similar theme) a too-corny-not-to-love noir story, and Timothy Cavendish – the up then down on his luck publisher trapped in a home for the elderly. Somni 451is a fabricant, or clone, that has experienced spiritual enlightenment and must spark a revolution. And lastly, Zachry – the guilty conscious goat herder who talks to ‘Georgie’ (the devil) in a post apocalyptic setting.<br />Each passage is a humanitarian vignette masquerading as an actually decent story. The reader cannot help but appreciate the genius of Mitchell or an overwhelming sense of divine cosmic intervention at work within the story. Odd coincidences, likethe fictitious coast of California changed after a certain abolitionist changes the future make the payoff worthy.<br /><br />For me, ‘Cloud Atlas’ has earned the right to audaciously gloat from upon my bookshelf amongst lesser works from celebrated writer’s, such as: Dick, Murakami, DeLillo, and Wallace. All of whom have set out on similarly ambitious tasks – to explore the constant themes explored by the overtly literary ‘sci-fi’ authors surrounding repetitive human follies such as: greed, corruption, and the exploitation of the weak.<br /><br />It is a healthy change of pace from the lackluster dystopian novel with the predictable Malthusian message: “Human’s have destroyed the planet.” Mitchell immerses us in a story about human bondage, he forces us to decide the definition of a soul, and in a light-hearted fashion, he makes us stop and think about a sect of today’s downtrodden – the elderly. It has elements of futuristic technology, tyrannical regimes, and disillusioned masses – but that is all secondary to amazing dialogue and storytelling. Language permeates as the plot crescendos throughout the novel with an unusual and creative timeline. The lexicon of the characters evolves and devolves – much like their civilizations.<br /><br />Mitchell orchestrates six, seemingly unrelated, stories and brilliantly ties them into one fascinating storyline that transcends humanities understanding of time and the ‘spirit’. The fabric of reality and destiny cross paths and seemingly miniscule acts from one person can snowball into another protagonist’s reality, all set adrift by that cosmic wildcard we call fate. Much like the rise and fall of civilizations based on a moral ethos brought on by collective human action, the individual soul can reach a higher status based on the individual’s past actions.<br /><br />“Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.”
B00GIY5OGC|3.0|OK movie. My kids loved it, I thought it was meh. We only rented it, thankfully we did not purchase it...don't see a lot of re-watch potential here.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because my kids' opinions brought the rating up. Now, I know it is a kids movie, but I couldn't help but picture other movies as I watched....there was no new ground here. Re-tread themes and overall story pulled from Cars, Talladega Nights, etc.<br /><br />Also wasn't sure how to feel about the ethnic stereotypes. They weren't offensive, but again, no new ground. There were the Hispanic taco-making brothers, the elderly female Asian nail salon owner, the mildly creepy but McGuyver-like male Caucasian hobby store owner, the tough girl Hispanic auto repair shop owner.....and then there were the other snails. Don't get me wrong, Samuel L. Jackson, Snoop Dogg and Paul Giamatti add character to anything but I just felt that there was no point to it. I guess it seemed that the characters were ethnic for the sake of being ethnic.<br /><br />There were some cute moments and some laughs throughout so there is entertainment value. Plus, the kids liked it, which is all that matters, right?
B00GIZO674|5.0|I love this game.  Very additive. Can't believe I got it on my tablet to play any time I want.
B000FBJG04|3.0|Made for TV film was better than the book.  Of course the book provided better detail then the movie.  Maybe I should have read the book first.
B001P575AM|5.0|Great movie! Even fun for adults and big kids! The game is great, too! It's a must have if you have young kids!!
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|A movie for children.  Characters a bit too silly.  The splashes of humor were certainly not adult.  Sorry I rented it for ten dollars.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Great story with a few changes that will keep you guessing. We read this for a book club and it was a great pick. You don't need to have read the previous BJ books to understand this one.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|Another sequel gone bad.  Everyone was back to collect a paycheck and not much else. Don't think there will be a 3.
B0091W6QZG|1.0|Howard Huges did not go crazy. He was in constant pain from his many aircraft wrecks to the point where just wearing clothes or cutting finger nails was intolerable. This is well documented and even proven by the autopsy. Hollywood has always hated this American Hero and do everything at every chance they get to besmirch this great man. Shame on Hollywood for getting this wrong again!
B000YMHOUS|1.0|Absolutely horrible movie.  So, basically everything that is wholesome is ridiculed, as portrayed by the &#34;black and white&#34; of the early part of the movie.  Only when people commit sin, do things &#34;spice up&#34; and become colorized.  I'm really surprised that I sat through this demonic film.
143911000X|5.0|Who doesn't love Barney Stinson? I got this for my fiance so that he could have a copy of the Bro-Code himself. He is enamored with it, and now, whenever the guys want to go out and do something, he gets a total broner! Thanks, Barney!
1476747016|3.0|Definitely cute, but the comics are more fun online than in a book because online they're moving gifs. Would definitely be a fun book for little kids.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|After enjoying Ender's Game, I assumed that this book would be a continuation of more than just one character.  I found the setting and new characters to be tiring after only a couple of chapters.  Further, the author decided that after one successful book, he could expound on his views on religion and politics on top of, rather than supporting, the story line.  In the preface, the author notes that this book was to be the start of the story and that Ender's Game was a prequel.
B000T433CO|5.0|I love this movie!!  I have watched it SEVERAL times!  It is sappy and predictable mush, but it's still a total feel good movie!!
B0091VYG86|5.0|I love this movie, it has such a strong message about prejudices people can have towards one another. Its imaginative and well acted. Well written movie!
B007MLMJ18|5.0|Mother of God?  Where has this guy been hiding all this time?  i am utterly floored!  The best musical production i have heard coming from Spain in a long time!  No bachata, no reggae no hip-hop just a perfect voice and superb arrangements,  And a DVD to boot!  It was a Xmas present.  I'm not sorry I opened it early!
B00GX598FO|1.0|I streamed this movie.  The picture was fine.  Unfortunatly, the sound was really bad.  I had to turn the volume way up just to hear it and the voices were still muffled.
B00F35BV64|4.0|This younger cast, which somewhat resembles the original crew visually copy the mannerisms, inflections of voice that are so convincing I was certain it had to be them only younger.
159413586X|5.0|Great book!!!  The last book in a great series.  Keeps your interest and has unexpected twists.  Fast past and lots of action.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Wanted to see it again...just as great the second time. Loved it. The apes look so real, amazing detail. great movie.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I love almost everything Brandon Sanderson writes.  The other day I was sick and in bed, so I decided to spring for a good read to cheer me up and distract me.  I bought Steelheart on my kindle.  The book was vast paced and entertaining, and definitely kept my mind away from the sniffles!<br /><br />Some have compared the book to the Mistoborn trilogy, saying that it lacks originality because there are some similar elements.  While I do agree that this book has some similarities to the first Mistborn book, I don't see that as a downside.  I loved that book!  This book has a very different setting and different characters.  When you are reading it, it just feels cinematic, like it should be made into a movie.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the sequels to the book, but can't figure out how Brandon Sanderson is going to write all of the books he has promised... Oh right, he writes like an EPIC.
B003TH5L7S|5.0|I have watched all seasons twice now, and I plan on watching all the episodes again and again and again!
B007RFBXHK|5.0|This is a great movie that I watched as a kid, many memories were watched when I started it again!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|So many things to love about this special. Sadly they would be spoilers sweetie and I don't give those. A wonderful tribute to the show and while I had my doubts in the first few minutes I soon was caught up in it.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Very Funny! So funny and good. Unwilling like much. Very fast to fun smile laugh good. Love it. Good. Actors.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|suspenseful and realistic, a must see  movie!! This movie keeps you interested the entire time! 5 stars for sure :)
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|Beautiful and well written. . Heart breaking story of a woman that never knew love. Portrait of an era gone forever with descriptions that paint in front of your eyes how &#34;things&#34; were and how &#34;people&#34; behaved. Worth reading again.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It's interesting to get into the heads of lawyers to see how they manipulate, negotiate, influence and give it all to try and control each situation.  Sometimes someone gets egg on their face.  I like the subtle humor.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is possibly the best book ever.  I couldn't believe 800 pages could go so fast or that I would be wishing it would go on another 800.  Donna Tartt only produced a book a decade, far too long to wait in between, but when she does, it is a whopper.  Now I want  a reproduction of The Goldfinch to hang in my house.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Recall seeing it on Premium TV some time ago.  It is a very SERIOUS/SCARY movie,  Actors are superb.  This will make a great gift for those who can take the 'action/killing/blood/gore...
B00821OX98|3.0|It's okay and there are interesting concepts but I don't think I'll be watching episode 2. There's just not enough new/different about it for me to justify spending time watching it when there are better options out there.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|read this, simple. Get lost in the pages, watch as time passes you by and a few minutes turns to hours.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book has really opened up my eyes and changed my thinking.  I am more focused than ever on the &#34;little things&#34; that I do daily and the way that they pertain to my marriage, my health, and my business.  This book is a MUST READ for anyone who has goals or dreams of ANY kind!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it play it can't put it down. Very addictive fun way to kill time. Makes the train ride go much faster
B00992CF6W|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson at his request for his 9th birthday.  It is right on his level and he LOVES it!!  That is what counts.  Great graphics.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|Its a joke, right.  Doesn't even play dead very well, The cats looked at it and walked away it was so bad.  More expensive to return this dud.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Not as good as the previous installments but still exceptional.  The imagery is rich in detail, the plot loaded with intrigue and surprises.  Moving on to the next one with excitement.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|The world and non-human intelligences are fascinating, but unfortunately the story focuses more on a multi-generational soap opera that is told in a heavy-handed and not very compelling manner. I enjoyed Ender's Game for its originality and fast pace; Speaker, by contrast, is a not-very-profound examination of the human condition.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Series continues to offer good entertainment with morality and ethics lessons good to know and be reminded of. One of the few series I have personally with stayed over the years.
B000V4NX04|5.0|An astounding movie that takes us inside one of the nastiest totalitarian regimes of modern times:  East Germany, 1984.  Author P. J. O'Rourke once said East Germany's totalitarianism was so complete that &#34;everything was forbidden that wasn't compulsory.&#34;  The film gives a view of that horrible world, where &#34;ordinary&#34; people live (and die) at the whims of bureaucrats, who can turn on them for the most venal and ordinary of reasons.  People who think that &#34;National Security&#34; is an excuse for everything should see this movie.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Like most tv series that continue for a long time, you get acquainted with the actors and like most soap operas, like to see them do well or badly in their endeavors depending on you personal feelings of each one. This series has stood the test of times and with good story lines as well as good acting, offers many of us great entertainment. Well done.
076535618X|3.0|Scalzi struck out with the first two books in the series. This one though, is actually a fun read. It was a nice change of pace to get away from Scalzi's painfully obvious lack of knowledge of military culture to finally get a good story worth reading. It gets only three stars because one has to wade through two bad books to get to this gem.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I love this seat and so does my baby!  I have it on a Motobecane hybrid bicycle and it fits well.  I am 5'4&#34; and have no problem pedaling with this seat attached.  I bought this when my baby was 6 months old.  She loved it then and still does.
0765348276|1.0|This book completely turned me off to military sci-fi writers that never served in the military. The dialogue is lame, robotic, and not humorous (at times when it is intended to be). The combat sequences are godawful; poorly written, confusing, and unrealistic. The protagonist goes from private to captain in an insanely short amount of time, which is obnoxious and not anything like real military life. Why do all of the heroes have to be officers in these fantasies written by non-military veteran writers? He, an old man, essentially becomes romantically involved with a child in an adult's body. The only good part about this book was the body-transfer concept to put seniors into new and improved bodies.<br /><br />If you want quality military sci-fi; stick with Heinlein, Haldeman, Ian Douglas, David Drake, or even newcomers like Tyvan Rollins. From now on I am sticking with ex-military writers to tackle military sci-fi.
B0090SI582|5.0|I bought it for my husband who likes the character very much. I'm not into X-men, but I watched it with him. It was a cute movie even for a drama lover like me. The action, the love story, the X-men kind of plot were all well-balanced, none of them dominates the scene but they are all well defined. A good movie overall.
B00FQ53NIA|5.0|After hearing the Femme Fatale album I didn't think that Britney could do better.  To me she is like the Beatles.  Well &#34;Britney Jean&#34; raises the bar again JUST LIKE the Beatles did.  She IS a superstar and moves the bar higher and higher with HER CREATIVITY.  Critics do not understand the music!!!  Luckily I do!! :)  I love Michael Jackson and the Beatles and Britney Spears.  What does that tell you?  There are no others in the same class.  This album is the bomb!!!!  YOU WILL love it!  Believe me.  Britney Spears does not need to fear anything in her life - only that people cannot comprehend just how great she is.  I recognized that (again just as I recognized the Beatles (when I was 4 years old and Michael Jackson as soon as I heard him).  Final Word:  Today - there is no question:  Britney Spears is THE QUEEEN OF POP!  That title is not to be compromised for a long long long time.  Sometimes we forget that it is you and I that are so fortunate to receive such a gift to hear such great music.  I don't forget.  THANK YOU BRITNEY SPEARS for what  you do and your music!!!  Thank you most sincerely!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's Firefly. If you're reading this page, someone you probably trust recommended the show to you. They're right, so you should listen to them and buy this.<br /><br />I've recommended it to 4 people so far(2 male and 2 female, for what it's worth). I'm 4/4 on them loving it.  What more could you want in a review?
B00DU74U74|2.0|My stepmom wanted a romance.  We wanted a SciFi. We settled on The Host and we were all unhappy. I want my four dollars and the two hours of my life back.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Haven't opened it yet, it's a xmas present for our son. We saw it in the theatre and that is all he talks about now. This is a great kids movie!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in this trilogy goes even farther in the darkness that we as a species is capable of.  Definitely a must read trilogy, regardless of age.  Highly recommended.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Kept your attention all during the book. How can this happen why does he hate his kids so much.why is he being so mean the truth will come out. John Grisham tells a great story.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I like this game but I hate having to wait for scratches so that you can play again. I now this game is free but I don't like the commercials, they annoy me. If it weren't for those two things I would pay more and rate this game higher.
B008LXZEYU|1.0|This movie was not at all funny. I wish Amazon gave refunds on partially watched movies. I was very disappointed.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This game is kinda fun. It passes the time. I don't like that u only get one coin per round but any hints cost fifteen coins. Granted I haven't had  to use many hints but I like to stock up on coins just in case, which is why I'm writing this.
B0020M99LC|5.0|best in the James Bond series. Like Daniel Craig's character and letting James be more human in his traits and weaknesses.
B00000IZOR|5.0|Got this as a gift for my great grandchildren. My daughter had been ordering from this site for a few days she loves it I used her name had no problems getting my order as I needed. Package arrived in time as I had ordered great product.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|As a piano teacher this app is invaluable.  My students can clearly see the settings and it is very easy to use
B008JFUOWM|5.0|This is a tough life experience for folks that enjoy the action movies.  Paul was apparently a good member of society and contributed to the betterment of his fellow man.  The movie entertainment is simply a plus.  Paul will be greatly missed and so will his actions, both in life and in film.  RIP, Dominus Vobiscum!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is one of the two new Star Trek movies by JJ Abrams - and the only thing i can is that it's great.  It's as good as any other action movie out there and I can only pray that you will give it a chance.  I know a lot of people are like &#34;Star Trek is dorky&#34;  But please what have you got to lose? Just try it. BUY it however because if you just rent it you'll be mad you wasted the money on that when you're eventually going to want to own it!
B00BEIYMZ6|2.0|You see the same lame crap in all of these stupid dumb humor movies, like when there at the border and there going to inspect there camper ( LOTS OF DRUGS INSIDE)....but just before the cop opens the door illegal's come running out from under the camper and the cop lets them go so he can shoot at them...really! that's just one of the many lame comedy acts they have. If your really bored I guess for 1$ at a Redbox go for it, but DO NOT buy this it sucks.
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|I love THIS movie.  It's a little sappy but it's a feel good movie with a little science fiction thrown in and some romance and comedy all wrapped up into one movie.  It's great.  it's a keeper and well...I've seen it more than once.  If you are a tender heated lover who can't stand it when Hollywood makes sure that the girl never gets the guy....then this movie is for you!!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Read it over the Thanksgiving holiday and could not put it down.  You could feel the cold from the snow and see the &#34;movie&#34; in your head playing out. Wow!  Looking forward to the next one...
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great, fun, fast read.  I may never run an ultra but this book made it feel possible.  Loved the recipes and Scott's journey through life is rich and fascinating.  You don't need to be a runner to enjoy this book
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I loved this book.It has action,romance and humor.What more can you expect.If you like Kings and Sorcerers, you will love this fantasy novel. I highly recommend it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I found this book to be a slow start but I couldn't put it down once I got into it.  I highly recommend The Book Thief.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is the finest novel I have read in years. It combines story telling,an in depth character study and a fascinating discussion of fine art history and philosophy.This is a coming of age story marked by a succession of traumas and their long ranging effects on this adolescent boy's development. Even though there were over seven hundred pages to read I found all of them held my interest and stimulated my thinking. I thought that all of the characters were extremely well drawn from the dysfunctional Park avenue family to the Ukrainian friendwho had undergone his own repetitive traumas. I found the settings of New York,Las Vegas and Amsterdam to be very evocative in the way that they were drawn and very moving in terms of their impact on this young person's experience.<br />  I highly reccomend this book to all of my literate friends.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|First of all, this is my second Nikon speedlight. The first was an SB-600 which I also loved. However it bit the dust when my wife tried to prop the camera up on a cookbook, box and a handbag in order to take a selfie with *my* Nikon D7000 for her fashion/Mom Blog. It is always a good idea to have a tripod around!<br /><br />Anyway, this speedlight makes all the difference for lighting indoor shots. Please Please Please do not use the popup camera. It is a weapon and haven't't we seen enough deer in headlights photos!<br /><br />Get this SB-700 and also a diffuser such as [[ASIN:B005EP26J4 EasyFoto Flash Diffuser Nikon SB700]]<br /><br />In addition, learn to bank this flash off of ceilings and walls for even more diffusion!
0312330537|5.0|Such an amazing tale/memoir! And written from a deep place of truth in this author. Made me consider visiting Bombay for the first time. Read the first 2 paragraphs and see if you can put it down!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great deal for all three movies and all the extras that you get for $25. The book has a good layout and the DVD extras are interesting; especially the documentary of the Batmobile.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|A classic that I did not read while in school.  Wish I had.  I am sure it would have made me a better student.
1401216676|4.0|Not sure if anyone has mentioned this in the other 400-something reviews, but KJ is 7.5&#34; × 11&#34; in dimensions. Amazon does tell you this, but nonetheless, it's cheeky and self-important (as compared to the 6.5&#34; × 10.125&#34; of pretty much every other Batman book ever). So if you put this on a shelf with all your other books, it sticks out awkwardly, and let's be honest, as good a story as KJ is, it's not the best nor the be-all-end-all of Batman books. But other than that, it's a fine product. It makes a great read, and at 65 pages is a great entry point for casual Bat fans (even if the writing is a bit weak, a villain origin story is lazy and unoriginal, and the ending is a big anticlimax).
B000JQU1VS|5.0|One of the best book of short stories that I have read.  Holmes is a classic and Watson telling the stories is excellent.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I got this so I could write some papers for college because my laptop recently died. I love it and it works fine for me, with one problem, THERE IS NO WAY TO PUT IN A HEADER OR FOOTER! If this could be added that would be great. Or I could just be oblivious and not understand how and if I could be corrected that would be great as well.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Last of three books was just as exciting as the first two.  Could not stop reading the series until I had completed the series.
0802473156|5.0|If you have EVER tried to figure out just what you really need from a relationship, this will help you.  Everyone has needs, those little empty pockets we expect someone else to fill.  Surprisingly many people don't really KNOW what they need, they only know they aren't getting what the they need.  This is a quick read, with a great little test (I took the test at the back of the book FIRST, then read it so I could concentrate on what applied to ME)<br /><br />Highly recommend whether you are currently in a relationship, marriage or still looking.
B008JFURKG|4.0|A very strong fun & exciting film! The actors & the characters, are totally the reason to watch! The over the top story line is typical these days, in any so called action film! lol I loved these actors, they alone are the reason to spend 90 minutes in front of the boob tube! I wish Hollywood would make more films like this, and less like the so called shoot em ups! More fun and truly enjoyable characters, and intelligent story lines! If things don't explode we survive! lMAO!!
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|I stumbled across this talented group by accident, but one view of a video and I had to find the album. Give them a shot - their talent and innovative take on Christmas favorites will leave you speechless , and longing for more!
B008V8FVTI|5.0|It was an intetesting and unusual plot. The acting was good.Kevin Bacon in one of his best roles as a nasty person.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Solid performances.  Accomplished costume/make-up.  The overarching premise was not substantially supported, but you catch on eventually, but a good show and worth watching.
B009NX409M|3.0|Slow. Predictable..I expected more from a de Niro/Streep film.. My wife wanted to watch it. I couldn't wait for it to end.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Both my husband and I love to use this app for sleeping.  We do a lot of traveling.  When we travel we stay at hotels.  I use a combo of the white noise, brown noise and the pink noise to make a sleep inducing mood.  The app helps block out outside noise and puts you in a state of relaxation.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything  about this series is superior and addicting.  It has everyone I know talking about how fabulous it is. DO not miss it from the first season on.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This may be the single greatest Bond movie of all time! Why not have it on every single media form?
B003P2WO5E|5.0|it takes a while to start connecting all of the plot pieces and characters, but it's well worth it.  Sanderson masterfully weaves characters inner and external development in a way that the individuals become great &#34;companions&#34; to think about.  I have read the last several chapters 3 times to relive the action see the characters I enjoy over and over.  There are many loose ends that I suppose volume 2 will work out.  I can't wait until it's released.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun, tropical setting the thought of releasing birds back into the jungle was challeng. Each level takes you to more exciting and exotic locations. Hated the monkeys, if you don't hit them right when they fall off they may get back up.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works well for the apps that are available on the chromecast, and for the price. Hope more apps will be added soon.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I stayed with this novel thru all 700+ pages only to be disappointed by the ending. I wanted to love this book. All the art and antiques and aftermath of a child-mother tragedy seemed like the perfect recipe for a great story. I did enjoy the story and character development,  up until the period when the main character returned to NY. At this point it felt excessively long, almost interminable.The descriptions of getting high, getting drunk, recovering only to do all that again and the introduction of the engagement to Kitsey (totally unnecessary in my view,&#34;kitschy&#34; in fact!) was disappointing. All of which is to say, I very much enjoyed about half of this novel and perhaps if it was half as long I would have rated it 5 star.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This APP is great, much easier than always having to g o to Yahoo, and having to deal with all the scrappy stories and politics. This App has made my Kindle HD worth having.
0316322407|4.0|This product shipped extremely fast, which I was very happy to see. I felt the book could of had bubble wrap surrounding it, because when I took the book out of the box, I saw there were light brown marks across the cover. After a little rubbing, some of the marks came off, but I was a little disappointed to see the book wasn't as 'new' as I expected. There was a small fold on the wrap around cover, but nothing major. (I do have to note, when it comes to taking care of books, I'm a bit extreme) :) Overall, I am very satisfied with this product, but I do suggest better care in packaging.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is well written book with outstanding development of the characters. I laughed out loud  (when reading on the subway), and felt the despair of Don as he realized mistakes he had made.  This is the author's first novel, it will be hard to top this story! Read it!
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|Just a series of scenes with no real plot development.  It's going to take more than imaginative graphics at this point to make a movie.  When one takes close to 3 hours to watch a movie I think its fair to expect some form of plot conclusion.  To Be Continued is baloney.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A lovely and endearing novel which slowly pulled me into its twists and turns.  I didn't want it to end.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Dirty Dancing is one of my all time favorites.  Fell in love with Patrick Swayze long before this movie. This was just the icing on the cake. We lost an amazing, wonderful actor who brought real talent and personal presence to the screen. I loved Jennifer Grey in this movie. She has a great wholesome talent, just sorry she wasn't happy with her looks and who she was when this film and Ferris Bueller were made. Plastic surgery gone bad!  Movei is cute and excellent.  Recommended for sure!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Suspenseful and a twists and turns of storyline keep one guessing to the end how conflict over completing wills will be resolved.
B0034G4P80|4.0|My kids loved this movie, I grew up on comic books, still like them I suppose if I'm watching and buying the movies.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|This fella here, opened my eyes when it comes to seeing. It's all there, in front of oureyes, or, should I say, the camera... For anyone who has an excuse aand not having enough equipment: forget it. No excuses, just actions.
B00BATG18K|5.0|After the first 10 pages I could not put the Valley of Amazement down. A fascinating peek into a world that no longer exists, but with people who seemed so real. The women had to be stronger and cleaver than the men around them who held so much power. I cried when the three women- mother, daughter and granddaughter finally found each other, and I wanted more when the book ended. Thank you Amy Tan for sharing this amazing story. I will recommend it to my book club.
B00DQQSD3Q|4.0|The content is absolutely great. The only issue I have is, I cannot play the media features: no audio nor video. I use the kindle for iPad app, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but it just doesn't work when it comes to reproducing the media. Otherwise, its a must for Star Wars and movie fans alike.Illustratiosn and art are just fascinating to look over and over again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books. Never disappointing. The characters are believable and most of the time likeable.<br />You never know where he is going with the plots. I knew from the begining Seth would turn out to be a very descent person<br />but, never expected the twist the story took.
B00G70JQZC|5.0|Excellent. I am a sucker for the X-Men so I am a bit biased. I felt this movie was better than the first Wolverine. The storyline is predictable, but it was interesting seeing Wolverine being vulnerable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It's Facebook so it's awful.  This company has made millions while destroying personal interaction.  It has created a generation of narcissist who believe they are so important that if their so called friends should have to keep up with their lives by reading about them on the internet like they were some kind of Hollywood celebrity.  Gone are the days that people just called each other and connected with their voices.  If my friends want me to know what's going on in their lives they had batter call me or come see me in person.  If I want them to know what's going on in my life Ill do the same.<br /><br />what's worse people now think that every small inconsequential detail of their life is somehow important and people need to know about it.  &#34;Hey guys just ate a chicken walnut salad and it was good!&#34;  &#34;Wow I just bought a late and here is a picture of it&#34;.  next thing you know people are going to be posting about their bowl movements.  This is an awful service and an app that connects people to it constantly from their phones is even worse.  I wish I could rate this app negative stars.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Enjoyed the story line, it gave you a glimpse of how lawyers think.  I don't read many books but read this one in 3 days.  I recommend it.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|I have to say, I initially bought this merely for one song, but have been very impressed with the entire album--impressive showing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is the best!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|there is too much bites and then it kept telling me that there wasn't enough memory. crap man I would have to get rid of EVERYTHING on there.. sorry not good enough..<br />I hope everyone else has better luck.. I don't recommend it.. sorry.. and I love my minions
B009ME47H2|5.0|I love this app alot!!! It works great! Its way to use and fun! Go get the app today! It's Awesome
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing show, and the first 2 seasons are free with Prime. Students should remember they get a year free of prime.
B00FN811SY|5.0|It is a great Bible Study Resource ... EVERY Bible translation has it's own agenda, there are no exceptions ... and by being able to compare FIVE (!) very easily, a good detective can subtract out the agenda. It's like Sherlock Holmes having a very competent &#34;Watson&#34;, handy.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the best christmas movie ever made. Good for the family as it's not too vulgar but still pretty funny
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting read. Both riveting and funny. Author does a great job making it as real as he can without disclosing any &#34;national security&#34; issues.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|great story line - it's a bit of a grammatical train wreck and the constant parenthetical informational blurbs were a bit annoying.  The story line is worth 10 stars however, making it a must read book/
B005PK1G76|4.0|Good product.  For the price, you really can't beat it.  I was tempted to order the Britax one to match our stroller, but just didn't want to pay for it.  Although I sometimes wish this one closed/covered and had bigger cup holders, I really can't complain about quality or overall functionality.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|great bag, but mine was missing some stitching on the inner pouches so stuff would fall out of the pockets.  Rather than return it, I got some tent thread and sewed it up myself.  It doesn't look like a professional job, but it holds stuff in.  Knocking one star off for quality of construction.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|It just did not compare to the others in the Pendergast series.  Probably it is a personal preference of the characters I grew attached to who we're missing from this book.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy<br /><br />Kanye West has really outdone himself with this amazing album. Kanye, the rapper out of Chicago, “spits wicked fire”  over these “fresh beats”.  I am a fan of Kanye West’s music and I liked My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy much better than his previous album. The album “808’s and Heartbreaks” was too soft and emotional for me. When recording this album West had gone through a breakup with his beloved girlfriend and finance, this really shows in his music. Kanye’s most popular songs were “Heartless” and “Love Lockdown”, these songs were good, but not his best.<br /><br />This album has a great variety of different types of emotion and the music gives off different feelings to the listener from track to track. The different types of music is a nice change and improvement from “808’s and Heartbreaks”. Some of my favorite songs off this CD include “Power”, “So Appalled”, and “Gorgeous”. Power is an upbeat and catchy song that gets your blood pumping and adrenaline flowing. Kanye fluently raps over this upbeat tune while rhyming in a faster pace that attracts the listener to this song. The feeling of the music is different on track number 7 “So Appalled”, this song has more of a anger to it. Kanye has a little anger and frustration in his voice while singing this song. “Gorgeous” is a sadder song where the beat is a little low and the pace of the lyrics are neither fast or slow.<br /><br />Kanye West is definitely an arrogant person and it shows through the lyrics of his music. I enjoy the way he uses his cockiness, his personality and attitude adds flare to his music in my opinion.  This album portrays a lot of Kanye’s cockiness and personality in the lyrical content of many of the songs on this tracklist. Songs like “Power” where he talks about how he is above regular civilians, “I’m living in the 21st century, doin’ something mean to it, do it better than anybody you ever seen do it” and “Monster” where he states, “Livin’ in the future cause the present is my past, my presence is a present” meaning that he is far ahead of everyone in life, but for him to just be around is a gift to all.  He just has this cockiness about himself that shows through in his lyrics, it brings some attitude and creativity to his music. The music on this album shows Kanye’s personality and his skill creating hip-hop music.<br /><br />Kanye West did many good things on this album that are enjoyable to listen to. This album is over three years old and I still listen to songs from this album on a regular basis. Kanye West is a talented musician and he proves it though his album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
B00G70JQZC|4.0|I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys Marvel and X men films.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br />At times the film drags and the ninja scene I felt was silly.  My main issue was with the Silver Samurai and his story. And the fact that Wolverine loses his Adamantium claws.  I felt that was stupid.  Without those he is just an indestructible guy.  I know in the comics he loses them and Magneto gets them back .  But some stories don't TranslAte well from comics to film.  I think this was a mistake in the storyline considering Days of future past and another Wolverine film are on the horizon.
0307744434|3.0|I agree with other reviewers, that this sadly didn't live up to the hype I had heard about it.<br /><br />I was really excited to finally get my hands on a copy and I was ready to completely fall in love with it...not the case, sadly. I kept waiting for that moment when all of the moving pieces would snap together and make me sad the end was coming near; instead I was relieved.<br /><br />This book has a lot of potential, lots of great imagery, the best parts are the little intermissions in second person or the little reviews of the circus. The characters are far too two dimensional. In a world that is focused on a circus they really need to pop, instead they are just moving parts. Not only that but the deus ex machina at the end was pretty frustrating, it didn't actually make much sense to me--and its where the writing was the  most sophomoric.<br /><br />I also felt that there were too many characters we were introduced to that just didn't matter, I know they were supposed to, but I didn't know them well enough to care. Some of the dialogue could be fun and zingy, but other times it sadly fell into cheesy.<br /><br />If the buzz hadn't been so great before I read this, I probably wouldn't have been as upset.<br /><br />She says what she struggled with writing this, and it does show. The plot is pretty threadbare, it really could have used a stronger hand to reign it in.<br /><br />I do see this, however, making really neat movie--because the director would have to trim the fat from the novel to squeeze it into a movie narrative, and we would get all of the fun visuals that Morgenstern really does excel at.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It has just the right degree of difficulty. It's not boring but neither is it so difficult that you just give up. Its everything my friends said it was and now I have to chase the level they're on.
006202406X|2.0|Contains Spoilers<br /><br />I just finished this, and even knowing and being prepared for the ending I am angry.  I read Ms. Roth's statement about why before reading the book and went into it wanting to know what led to this finale... Was it at least a good story leading up to the devastating ending.  The answer to that is yes, it was a good story and the motivation behind Tris' sacrifice was clear.  She really did come full circle and the author does a good job showing her growth and maturity.  However, the ending just didn't serve any purpose.  Yes, we get she couldn't let Caleb die, yes she followed in her parents footsteps, but what was the point?  Especially after she survived the death serum, found out David did indeed love her mother, and then only to be shot?!?!  I mean come on, how lame can you get?? So many other things could have happened and she picked the worst and lamest way to go.  If she didn't want to go for shock value then she shouldn't have included all the tear jerkers either... Looking into Tobias' eyes, planning a future together, finally having a reason to want to live through the good, bad, and ugly.  Knowing the ending definitely made me more aware of these lines and it was just an attempt to go straight to the heartstrings.. These attempt would not be needed if she were just going for a powerful ending, and as a result ended up coming across as trite.<br /><br />There was so much potential for a wonderful novel and I wanted to love it... Would have loved it if she had gone virtually any other way then she did.  And this is not simply because I'm upset the heroine died, but it was trite, superficial, and either the author wanted shock value or else just wanted a reason to never have to write about this story again.  As President Snow said in the Hunger Games as long as there is hope that is all someone needs to have a spark.  Well, all hope was dashed completely and buried in the ground. Do not know if I have ever been more dissappointed in a book before.in a book before.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found the book to be very entertaining. It kept  me on my toes and craving more. Through the twists and turns of the final book of the hunger games an unexpected ending doesn't disappoint. Enjoy
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldn't wait to find out what happened to Danny and Wendy.  It was worth the wait.  Loved A<br />bra!!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Wonderful gadget!  I love using my iPod nano while going on a jog rather than my bulky phone.  But even when I use my corded earphones on my small, lightweight Nano, the cord always gets in the way or gets tangled up during my jogs.  I didn't know this device exist until I ran across it while searching for a Bluetooth earphones with mic for my phone.  Glad this exist 'cuz now I can use my Bluetooth headsets with my iPod Nano that does not have that Bluetooth capability.  So much freedom to jog with this!  I'm more motivated to run longer with this device.  Works really well!!!  It was very easy to pair this device with the Avantree Sacool Bluetooth Headset I ordered with it and the delivery was super fast, surprisingly considering they have to deliver all the way here in Hawaii.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game should be rated ten million stars<br />Man how addicting this game is and I think you should definitely try it right now
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book grabs you and never lets go. It's painful, funny, intense, desperately sad and finally optimistic yet infused with realism. Too bad we have to wait another ten years before her next work...but it will be worth the wait.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|beyond bad...timberlake type of bad...wish i would have NEVER checked out from the library...my ears cry for ALL soundgarden fans...please let this all be just a bad dream...!...PLEASE!!
078518533X|3.0|The story is great, but only gave it a 3 because of the condition it arrived in.  Bent pages and cover - not happy considering the price you pay for it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|very well produced, I am blown away by how good their camera capture is. The story also giving me a very well manner for not treating bad to whom to harm you. I am learning to become more and more a humble person. Although, I wish their dress never appeared twice or more because I love watching their new fashion.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|it is a very GOOD movie.....it was every thing i thought it would be....it touched my heart and i will share it with other people
B00GINENG0|4.0|It's awesome you get to take care of him he gets taller the more you play it get it now!!!! And there's fun mini games you can play like find the smile.
B000WCDBKM|1.0|This was a very slow and very boring movie.  It doesn't even have a good ending.  Don't waste your time watching it.
B00GX59QO2|3.0|Was an attempt to be a good sequel, epic fail there, the really aggravating thing about the whole movie was how Mary-Louise Parker's role was to act like a complete clueless idiot with this retard look on her face 90% of the time. Im like come on REALLY. But it is what it is. Had its moments and worth a rent.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game but extremely addictive.  I don't like the fact that when you mess up a level you only get a few tries to complete and then have to wait 30 minutes to gain another life so you can continue the game.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Great CD. I don't skip any of the songs on the album.  All of Me is my favorite song so far.... I was expecting a quality album since it's John Legend.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|As we move into a culture that, more and more, depends on the Internet and the services of companies like Google and Facebook to communicate, it is wise to be aware of the power that these organizations wield over our daily lives.  &#34;The Circle&#34; presents an eerie scenario about how one of these companies could take a lot of &#34;baby steps&#34; to gain power over our lives and convince us that that is a &#34;good thing&#34;.  I found it to be a good read and recommend it to those of you who enjoy good conspiracy stories.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|A lot of fun is to be had with Terraria, although, I suspect it is easier to use on the computer...it is kind of like Minecraft, but not totally. A unique experince to be sure, and if you liked Minecraft, you'll like this as well.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is one of my top-five favorite movies of all time!  A triumph of spirit over circumstances.  Very uplifting and sad at the same time!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was very inspiring and I love that it wasn't a one sided feminist book either. Both men and women have valuable roles and great qualities to contribute, women just need to get out there! I highly recommend reading, you will become aware of some of your own behaviors that contribute to the problem!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This game seems difficult at first but once you get the hang of it is very addictive!<br />Love it, can't put it down.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This is by far one of the best and easiest to use recorders I've ever tried, and I've used plenty. I've used it to record A-list band rehearsals and this thing sounds amazing. It has built-in mics or can be plugged directly into the soundboard for even better quality. It has a mic stand mount -- nice feature -- so you don't have to deal with vibrations from a table or wherever you set it down. It is super simple to set up an audio file to record, and to dump it into a computer for editing.<br /><br />I really like the old-school start/stop/record ability on this, as it makes it simple enough for even old school musicians to use. (Many digital recorders are not very user friendly -- something most of the digital age is forgetting.) Zoom knocks it out of the park with this one, and it's affordable too.<br /><br />I first heard about this from a keyboard player in a band I work with on a regular basis, and he is even more of a techhead than me. Thanks, zoom, for making a great product. I also reviewed it on my booksnbands website some time ago.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Good story, but a little too much detail.  I look forward to the stories with the doc.  I enjoy the characters
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I knew what this book was about when I bought it.  It still surprised me how well received this book has been, given the poor writing style of the author.  It almost seems like a teenager wrote it.  I am plugging along though, and will finish it eventually.  May just take me a while though, as other books are much more worth reading.
0762445262|2.0|It really does not show up unless you have it pointing right at a wall! I thought it would show up on ceiling better but no!
067088278X|5.0|This is a fantastic book for the 1 to 4 age range. beautiful detailed drawings make for a fun I Spy experience, and there's excitement as well as a cozy, soothing conclusion.  My boys liked to have the text recited to them at bedtime.  If this book were better known, it would stand up to time along with goodnight moon. Lovely.
B00338QENI|4.0|I laughed and cried at some embarrassing places where strangers looked at me funny. Great read. Very well written. I feel like I know the family. Knowledge truly is power. Thank you Henrietta Lacks.  I earned about your cells in class and now about your family. What a lady.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|I have had a few problems with the tablet I purchased, but nothing that could not be overcome with persistence, it was a good purchase.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The picture quality in Blu-Ray was much better than I had anticipated. Above all, a classic movie I've loved since I was a child and was glad I was able to watch it again with my little ones and give them the same experience.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Man!  This was awesome!  I recommend this download! and for those people that need to book smell and feel - go for it - it's just not for kids in my opinion! great read - you do need all three!  The first was the best!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I love this trilogy I love this book! <3 I would definitely buy this book if I were you :)
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Great book for all teachers to remind them of how ALL children can succeed if given the right amount of support, encouragement, and caring.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|A great buy for all Eminem fans and has songs with 50 cent and D12.  Get it if your a fan.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This season certainly brings the relationship to the foreground. The writing team are doing some great things to go beyond what most TV shows fail at this point making the relationship the main focus of the shows dynamics.
B005GSVFB4|5.0|Awesome 3D movie.  Usually animated movies are good in 3D and this is no exception.  Must own 3D movie, including 1 and 3.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Season 3 was a little too serious for me, but love the episodes where Kate and Rick are getting closer be being real partners.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I like this one from him because it sounds like his earlier songs.  Great buy and will not be disappointed.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome interaction of the super hero's and their special abilities. Great action scenes. They even kill a recurring character from the other films in it. I'm not telling who though.
B000002C2E|5.0|One of the best albums by Dylan and of all Grammy winners.  Get this album if you like Dylan and/or if your a music lover.
B000L212HC|5.0|I love this movie. Saw it for the first time on broadcast TV in Hong Kong. Could not find it &#34;free&#34; in the US to share with my family. So I picked up the Blu-ray. I haven't looked at any of the extra features yet. But the movie was everything I expected.
B00GTZN0X4|5.0|Fun movie to watch with the kids. It runs along the same lines as Cars so you kinda know what is gonna happen in the end. My family enjoyed it none the less.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|one of the best in history. love it all time! so moving and heart-touching. everyone should watch it, in this humanity-lacking world.
B002APU580|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I could watch it over and over and I do. The acting is fabulous. I recommend this version to everyone.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|But having to bother Facebook folks is irritating. Why can they not just have other players connected. I like the game, but wish Facebook wasn't required.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's similar to candy crush but I think it's definitely more entertaining. I'm glad I found it.
B00DV3A84G|4.0|I'm a sucker for some good indie pop and Bastille fills that void admirably. This is an album of tunes impeccably produced, constructed, and executed to maximum effect.<br /><br />By now hits like \\"Flaws\\", \\"Pompeii\\", and \\"Things We Lost in the Fire\\" have probably graced your ears. If you dig those songs then this record will most likely please you, as most of the tracks here follow in a similar vain. Songs like \\"Daniel in the Den\\", \\"These Streets\\", and \\"Icarus\\" are filled to the brim with emotion and effervescent melodies that make you want to interact with the songs and keep listening. In fact, I'd rank \\"Laura Palmer\\" as one of the best songs of 2013, a soaring and ambitious track that delivers everything I love in a song: grand instrumentation, big emotion, and superb production. I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />The only thing that holds this album back is the lack of diversity present in many of these songs. As good as the group is they also have a tendency to stick with a similar sound that makes a few of the tracks bleed together. This gives the album cohesion and for that they should be commended, yet it would have been nice to see them branch out and try something a bit different on some of these tunes. Here's hoping that they continue to expand and deliver another great album in the near future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game on my phone and kindle fire hd I play it day and nite and my grandkids love it too.
B009CFYRCG|5.0|This movie needs no words. It's One of a kind. How the cast kept a straight face is beyond me.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|The graphics are awesome and there seems to be a lot of play value. If you check many of my ratings, you'll find I'm hard-nosed about app security, this one passes the test. eeven though there are seemingly many permissions, they're all harmless from a privacy perspective. Great flick fun, the dev pulls off a 1.99 app wwith great roi.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I tried to give the new version the benefit of a doubt, but it's just not as User friendly as original version.  bring back old version and I will be glad to download again.
074356619X|5.0|Helped me through a rough spot in my life.  My daughter recommended it when I was going through an emotional crisis, helped to ground me and gave me a new perspective.  Some of the music was a bit melodramatic.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|It was a great movie, offering  quite  a different view of life for people in the 60;s. For sure worth the rental amount.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I found out that this book was actually a youth read I was totally amazed. It renewed my faith in what younger people are reading.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Love Lara Croft character! The movie is a classic and was priced right by Amazon. It is a very good movie, and I am not much on these type of movies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I didn't think this would be so addictive but it is! I just wish there was a way to get help or skip a stage without paying.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|FUN FUN FUN.  A bowling game that adults or children will enjoy.  The graphics are so cute.  My 5 year old granddaughter loves this game and so do I.  Highly recommend.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|It's very amazing there are no ads and I vety usful nothing bad about I think it is great you should get this app and enjoy it
B008K9SG9K|2.0|There are is no electronic info displaying on the CD player screen, and the drums sound overpowering like the copy is a cheap counter-fit.  The musicians are awesome and the album is great - this specific cd is very poor quality.
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|Great movie and definitely worth the watch.  There are so many funny parts.  We are always quoting the characters now.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Perfect twist on the superhero genre. Many reviews will say it's a coming-of-age tale; it's not. It is a morality play about what different people do when given absolute power.
1439196834|5.0|This book is both hilarious and questionable. Aside from the fact that it was mostly meant for a joke, it does supply some minor keys to getting the courage to talk to someone of interest.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Fantastic movie that urges you to travel, live a simply life, meet great people. The story is real, the sound track is INCREDIBLE! one of my favorite movies in a very long time. If you're a chick, then you'll probably fall in love with Emile Hersh too. great actor.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Honestly, I cannot stop listening to it. I have had it for over a month now, and it has been the only thing playing in my car since. And trust me, I am driving a lot. From the first to the last song, it tends to refresh your interest every time and keep you going on.
B0002858YS|5.0|I sooooo love this band!  Brandon's voice is gorgeous, and the entire group contributes in such a great way to each song. I really enjoy this group.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Easy read, good story. I am waiting to see what moral decision the character makes. What would you do if it was your husband?
B00GCMQY4G|5.0|This album has the songs I love, and some that I have grown to love.  They picked all the ones I would've picked myself!  This band has such a diverse range of musical styles, but I can always recognize them.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I never saw it coming! Excellent Sci-Fi presentation. The characters were so well developed that it drew my right into the craziness of Battle School. Toward the end of the book I began to suspect what was going on, but it was so well done that I just went along with the flow and thoroughly enjoyed the book. I could hardly put it down.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love this movie, Chris Hemsworth has done an excellent job in this role.  The movie was funny, filled with action, and I enjoyed it very much.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I had the first one it was stooky (totally awesome) the second is total rockets (totally awesome)<br />it is the stookiest (awsomest)
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I really enjoy Maroon 5, the entire band is so talented.  The songs are also diverse, they have a definite unique style, but have songs that should satisfy every fan.
B0057UA4FY|1.0|No were on the packaging or description does it say this a blue ray.  It is a blue ray.  with no blue ray player and no ability to return I'm just out the money.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Call me a Cumberbitch - I see the attraction now.  He is great as Sherlock and Bilbo Baggins makes an excellent Watson.  They updated the setting & the times and it works!  Highle recommend.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown's usual thrilling adventure.  It keeps you wondering what else can happen to him. I really enjoy his books.<br />Dick B.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Awesome. Great classic. Kept me on my toes the whole time. It was just as thrilling to me as when I watched it when it first came out!
0062255657|5.0|Gaiman’s “The Ocean at the End of the Lane” is just right, and has some of the same archetypal power of a “big” dream that we just can’t forget, whose images often return to us, expressing vital things that cannot be said with words.<br /><br />This small but powerful and haunting book is in the same league with Robert Holdstock’s “Mythago Wood,” and the writings of Charles de Lint.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had my eyes on this device since the day it was released and was very excited for it because I saw the potential it had.  I also own a Logitech Revue, which I love (except for the lack of continued support), and an Xbox.  I bought this because I wanted to stream videos from my (nearby) desktop computer.  With only a weeks worth of use I can say that I am very impressed and happy with my purchase.  Although the device has some limitations, which are hopefully temporary, I can say the potential is huge!!!  My first impressions are as follows:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Setup: Simple! As a self described FANdroid, Google shamelessly steals Apple product packaging and beats them at their own game when it comes to setup.  I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />- Usage: Using the device is so simple.  My friends and family were amazed how easily they could share video on the big screen from their own phone.  Casting anything from my desktop is easy too while using Chrome!  I was a little discouraged when I wanted to browse the internet with it until I realized there is an &#34;experimental&#34; option to cast the entire desktop.  (Although the mouse cursor is not cast properly yet, I see this as being a future addition.)<br /><br />- Price: No comparison!  Nothing else compares to the value of this device.  I love my Revue but this unit does essentially everything that it does and allows anyone to share their videos/music as they please.<br /><br />- Travel: This thing is perfect for anyone on the go!  I have not been able to use it yet in a hotel but I already plan on buying a second one just to keep in my travel bag.  Setup is so easy and allows you to watch whatever you want.<br /><br />- Opportunity: This is the biggest &#34;Pro&#34; in my opinion!  Google has not opened up the SDK yet, but when they do the possibilities are endless for this device.  I see this as being the device that forces the cable/satellite providers to reevaluate their offerings.  It has huge potential!<br /><br />CONS: (few but worth mentioning)<br />- On Screen Selection:  My only major gripe is that you are forced to use your phone/tablet/computer to select you next video which is not shown on screen.  Owning a Google TV box and Xbox I enjoy being able to review a movie or show with my audience before watching it.  I wish I could cast the entire Netflix app so that I can see what I'm about to watch and share this with everyone else.<br /><br />- &#34;Open&#34; source: Ok, so even as a fan of Google and Android, I'll admit I wish Google would open up the SDK to everyone and allow all apps to have access to this wonderful device.  I think this will happen soon and I understand why Google would want to &#34;lock in&#34; the big players such as Netflix, HBO, etc. but I still want a more open environment since it will only enhance the product.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />Overall I highly recommend this product and plan on making this my go to Christmas gift this year.  It truly is a great device and really has a huge potential to take over the living room!  If you are wanting a streaming device, this is the one to get.  It's cheap, quick to set up, and has most the functionality of any other device (and functionality is going to expand soon *hopefully*).
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Great cd, a true classic Michael Jackson, bought it for a friend, who was a fan...Poor Michael Rest in Peace!
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I just played a few games of the June 1, 2014 update. I own the Carcassonne Big Box and play the board game every few weeks. It is one of my favorite. The recent update to the android version gave the game a nice looking GUI overhaul. If I had anything to criticize, my only issue about the GUI would be that many of the buttons and menu options are a bit tiny on a phone. I can still hit the mark most of the time, but I do feel like I need to pay more attention.<br /><br />I love, love, love that several expansions are now available in a bundle (though I wish they could be bought separately). I have not purchased them for play yet, but I am looking forward to them.<br /><br />It looks like the AI had received some updates as it does play a bit smarter than it's previous version...the AI is still not very difficult against a seasoned Carcassonne player, but what can you say? Carcassonne on the go is wonderful.<br /><br />I did encounter a few bugs during the my first few games. I have also read that the expansions have some bugs as well. I am sure that they will iron them out in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />This game is still well worth the money
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Great bought as a gift, who admires the character...funny movie, makes you laught, way to go to Jeff! Very funny!!
1451695195|5.0|This was a powerful book and should make readers who view the human mind as the highest form of intelligence on earth rethink their conceit. How could this man whose brain was not functioning at all by all standards of our science have experienced what he did? It could not have been due to a subconscious &#34;dreaming&#34;, for he had no conscious --sub or otherwise-- functioning. Nor did he appear to have any reason to deceive others, especially with regard to proving the existence of a heaven. This was certainly a book that made me think we humans, especially those of us who live upon our minds, need to set aside our often fatal conceits and recognize that there is far more we do not know about this world and universe than there are things we know.
B004G6TD8Y|5.0|Classic ELP.  I had this as an album and I have always wanted to replace it on CD.  So Now I have. I saw them once live in Louisville Ky. on The Brain Salad Surgery Tour.  A top notch Prog Rock Band.  How do three guys get this much sound???  Keith Emerson on keyboards ( Hammond B3 , Moog )  Greg Lake ( Vocals, Bass, 6 and 12 string guitar ) and Carl Palmer ( Drums ). This Band has a sound like no other.  I love their music and I love this CD.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Once I started playing I simply could not stop!! Finally.....a game that has it all:  adventure, strategy, hidden objects, quick yet challenging &amp; intelligent mini-games, puzzles, high def graphics, mystery &amp; suspense....&amp;, yes, even an interesting story line!!! I highly recommend this one!
B003OFHMKO|4.0|Esperanza Spalding is a real treat.  I am not an authority on Jazz.  But, I am a real fan.  I can spot talent when I hear and I hear it all over this CD.  Her Fretless Bass playing is so smooth.  Esperanza also displays talent as a fantastic vocalist.  This is a CD to check out if you want to hear something fresh. You won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and addictive!!! Hands down, one of the best games on here! If I could rate it a ten, I would! And now available on kindle;);) SCORE!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Its a good show,it keeps me coming back after each episode. Very entertaining, love it, love it, love it !
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good, basic game without too many unnecessary frills. Would like to see easy access to personal statistics: wins, losses, etc.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Tom cat is very funny & entertaining. You will keep the attention of any crowd. This can be used for all ages.
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|I have to tell you all that I am going to have a very excited 11 year old grandson when he opens his action figure of Daryl Dixon of the Walking Dead!  I ordered this on the 27th of October and it did take some time in getting here but it was worth the wait.  It is very life like and larger than I was thinking.<br /><br />I dealt with a distributer called Cloud Nine Products  to get this toy.  I would recommend this company to anyone!  The person I dealt with was very polite and understanding.  He went out of his way to keep me informed of the shipment of this figure to me. I would deal with this company again anytime!<br /><br />Thank you Cloud Nine and Amazon for your level of customer service.  My grandson is going to be so happy which makes me very happy!
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app is so wonderful.  it help the earnest bible reader with research. Once I start I can't stop. Thank Jehovah for this wonderful tool.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Seems like people just like to gush over anything Google. Well this thing does NOT work as advertised. I suggest before buying and rather than reading all this glowing reviews, you go check the google groups for this product first. Look at the number of unanswered questions there.<br /><br />Chromecast is at best in ALPHA, even though google itself calls it a BETA release. It is not ready for production. I am not sure why they released it to the masses.<br /><br />1. Installation is a nightmare. Took me about 3 hrs and 3 different PC/Laptop combinations to install through one PC. Even then, the other 2 machines did not see it on the SAME WIRED network. One thing I thought was funny was the number of times I got the \\"Uh-oh moment\\" error which basically means \\"we are as confused as you are.\\"<br /><br />2. Bought this to replace an old laptop I had hooked up to my TV. thought it was less bulky and I loved the id of Tab Casting. I though I could cast amazon prime shows using that. Well, any site I tried casting (other than the 4-5 sites like youtube, netflix etc that are optimized to work with this thing) FAILED to cast. I would get a still image of my PC on TV. Thought it was my Flash Player as most these sites have embedded flash content. Uninstalled and re-installed flash but nope that wasn't it. Called google support. Below is the system req they SAY you need for tab casting [...] Phone support did not know this. They told me 'tab casting does not work.'<br /><br />3. Finally after posting to the google groups someone was kind enough to admit this product is not ready fro primetime. The only tab casting supported is on one particular Chromebook machine and nothing else!<br /><br />If you need to cast Youtube videos on your TV then I guess this is great. Otherwise, stay away
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A most incredible story of war, love and compassion. From page one until the end I was mesmerized with thrill upon thrill. this was the most exciting true war story I have read. don't miss this one!
B007EW9ISM|3.0|The cap got stuck on the end and I couldn't get it off, this was on the first day. Boohooo. The business end still works though once I peeled off the cardboard cap. I love the heft of this stylus. I feel like I'm Harold w his purple crayon. Good for note taking. But heavy, not so good for a teeny purse or shallow pocket.
1401322336|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift for my friend's son in Serbia!  He was THRILLED with his gift and I was too!
B008JFUR10|1.0|From the trailers this movie looked exactly like my kind of thing, and I really expected to like it. Giant robots fighting giant alien monsters? What's not to like, right? Plenty, as it turns out:<br /><br />The plot<br />In a word, ridiculous. I can suspend disbelief with the best of them but I have eye strain from the number of times I rolled my eyes at the absurd explanations for the absurd situations this stinker kept tossing out.<br /><br />The characters<br />Under developed, cookie cutter characters who did nothing at all to make me care about them. Their interactions with each other were shallow, predictable and stereotypical. Do they live? Do they die? Do they save the world? Who cares...<br /><br />The dialogue<br />Corny, cheesy and recycled from a handful of other B-grade sci-fi movies. &#34;We're canceling the apocalypse!&#34;, please...<br /><br />Pretty much everything else<br />The music score was jarringly bad in several places, the fight scenes take place mostly at night, in the rain, so you can't even appreciate the CGI.<br /><br />I love sci-fi action adventure movies. I also love campy, fun, mindless movies that don't take themselves too seriously. This movie seemed like it was trying to be both but failed spectacularly in my opinion. The worst movie I've seen in a long time.
1620402777|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my father. He's a math nerd (has taught advanced mathematics courses for 20+ years), and my entire family knows the Simpsons inside and out. He has almost finished reading the book, and he said it was incredibly interesting. I was unaware that many of the Simpsons show's writers came from such educated backgrounds (engineering, mathematics, etc), but my dad relayed this info to me and said there were so many little things in the Simpsons that he had never caught on to before and that this book was proving that to him! Definitely borrowing my gift when he's done with it (:
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake Shelton...that's all you really have to say about this CD.  This guy is great...the bad boy with the innocent face and the dimples that go on forever!  However, the important thing is that he can really SING, and he ALWAYS stays true to his roots!  This is one of Blake Shelton's BEST music moments ever...not a bad song on this CD.  Don't hesitate on this one.  You will love it!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Entertaining but not great movie.  Jennifer Lawrence looks great, but there are a lot of things that stretch the story line to absurdity.  Why do they team up, when the strong are brutally violent and the object is to kill everyone and be the lone survivor??
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|A great book from start to finish, i am about to purchase the sequel, this book is a must read
B00GH4R95C|5.0|The best superman movie I've seen, although there was room for improvement.  Could have been made to have more funny situations and more scenes of his adopted parents just raising him as a young child.  I liked that Lois Lane was pretty but not photoshopped perfect, it made her more natural.  The graphics and special effects were good but did not overpower the basic storyline.  Nowadays movies are sometimes made with great graphics and really weak stories.  Graphics have improved tremendously over the years but its still creative storyline that makes a movie great.  I don't really see the point to a &#34;Transformers&#34; type movie where anything is possible but there is no point to the story.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this is a powerful program, with dozens of options, that makes the task of setting alarms and timers easy and enjoyable.  different tones for different alarms.  different frequencies.  all in a slick package.
B000083E79|5.0|The Ultimate Christmas Gift .. Right Here.<br />Thank You VERY MUCH. Great CD filled with Timeless Classics.<br />Shipped Quickly .. In Great Condition. A stocking stuffer indeed.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I am not of a gamer, but this a fun one.  I ended up staying up 3 hours later than planned playing this stupid game.  :-)
B009MO5G90|2.0|As the film formula generally goes, quality deteriorates through sequels. I don't think the Resident Evil series are mind-blowing, but I've always been entertained and engaged. Holy mother of sanity. This installment however, is the epitome of a bonkers sequel. I was embarrassed to have brought company over to watch it. All in all, I'm going to go watch this now.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|It arrived on time, was in great condition. Our kids and us watched the movie about 20 times in December, and they love it. And it's tolerable for adults too!<br />It teaches generosity, love, character, responsibility, and determination!
B00DAXXO98|4.0|Intriguing, deep and complex characters.  What goes on in &#34;House of Cards&#34;, however, pales in comparison to the real Washington D.C.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book....must read lol have your husband/wife nearby cause you will want some action....this book kept me wett!! Use protection lol
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent read! Fills in many details from the movie. Will definitely be reading  the next two books.  And anxious for the third movie to be released.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My son and I love this game. I already beat the game and my son is working on it, but he's only five so it'll take him a little while yet. Even though I've beat The game, I still like to go back and play it. I don't do that with most games unless there this good.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|One of the finest books I had read in recent times.<br />Superbly written. It has the power to transform you  in the subzero temperatures an  bring the histrionics of the great animal named BUCK. Strongly recommended for the lovers of good English....
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Fantastic game! My five year old and I look forward to playing this game whenever we have time to sit down and relax.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I find this book puzzling.  It seems that Katniss cannot balance her reality through the whole book.  I do believe that she and Peeta belong together, but it seems even at the end of the book that she still it's quit sure of this herself.  She right about worse games to play though.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This has to be the best Angry Birds game ever! My son and I played all the other Angry Birds games, but when this one came out we downloaded it and love it. We have an iPad mini,a Kindle fire HD, and have it on both.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is the best game ever it messes with your mind, sometimes Erie sounds, and when not trying can give you a jump (note: this is not a scary game, its a puzzle game) this game could even the master of puzzles.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have played majjong on the computer and this works fine. It isn't super challenging, but it works as far as passing the time.
B002DOSBMK|4.0|This book is a great book definitely worth reading...enjoy this book and the other books in this series... Make sure you start with this book..
0992251656|5.0|This is a super long game, high barrier of entry, but I love it! If you liked the show or like complex gaming, you will not be disappointed. The extra PDF goal card (on the game's website) is a much faster first time game, our first 4-player game with the King of all Londinium card took +4 hours. :D
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Did not watch much of the movie.  It was not what I expected Washington to be in.  I do not watch movies that have people shooting drugs and other low life things.
B00GI13VYW|3.0|Hmm. His first album was fantastic and raw. This one feels overproduced and mediocre.<br />There are several songs that are very good, but overall it feels like the corporate music folks pushed him into an LA studio and threw a rock band behind him.
B00130UFY2|4.0|I enjoyed the tactics of evasion used by Jason Borne, in the train station full of commuters.  I have been to this station, and found it to be realistic.  Some of the blood and guts were a bit overdone.
B001OSIV62|3.0|Interesting, but not outstanding. Fun to see the preparation and psychological processes of Philippe Petit and his team.  Seems triumph resulted in rupture of relationships with those who enabled him to succeed.  Disappointing.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I read this book with great interest because the author backs up all of his claims with solid, scientific documentation.  As a food chemist for 50 years, I have read many studies concerning cholesterol and for some time there was a discussion raging both for and against cholesterols influence on heart health.  As time went by, there evolved a theory that inflammation rather that high cholesterol levels was what caused heart problems.  Now as more time goes by there is an increasing evidence that inflammation is indeed the culprit.  So the theory of eating a carbohydrate-rich diet and eliminating high-cholesteroil foods to alleviate concerns about heart health is being stood on its head and now it appears that eating a high fat, low carbohydrate diet as espoused by Dr. Perlmutter is the way to go.  Cutting out carbohydrates begins with cutting gluten out of your diet. Yes, bread, cookies, cakes, and a lot of other things containing flour that you have enjoyed in the past are out.  Excluded also are refined (white & brown)  sugars and especially HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) foisted upon us by the food industry because it is cheaper to produce than cane sugar as it's made from corn, something we have a lot of.  HFCS has allowed our food and beverage makers to enjoy record profits at the expense of our health.  Read those ingredients labels in you pantry and refrigerator and start throwing out maybe half your stuff.  Dr. Perlmutter presents his solutions and even includes some safe recipes as well as having a web site where more information can be found.  Do you find all this hard to believe? Read the book, learn, and watch the non-believers drop like flies around you.  Makes a great Christmas gift for the ones you love and Amazon's got it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really really fun I had it on my old kindle and when I got my new one I downloaded it again I wish it was a little faster paced tho
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun game!!! Yes you have to purchase stuff to get more but i just play it the way it is and have just as much fun!!!e
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|It is a awesome game. I love playing it. I would give it 5 stars if they expanded the story. it is short and then once completed it repeats at a harder skill level.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was amazing and SUPER well written, and I like when books have some humor and something that makes me never want to put down the book. I highly recommend this series to anyone that likes fairytales and a good story
B003B02O0A|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  I think it was Grisham's first book.  Somehow I overlooked it because I do enjoy him as an author.  The characters were believable.  As a result I picked up his very next book Sycamore row.  They were both were priced low and worth top dollar.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very limited use, not as advertised.  They make it seem like you will be able to stream everything that you have on your computer or tablet, but in reality you can only stream from a few selected apps.  Not as advertised.  Google really dropped the ball on this product.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. It is a great book with great symbolism that really make think outside the box.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|Very well done movie and actors did a great job considering I didn't know who any of the top actors.  But as expected books are always better.
B005R32L66|4.0|I have been using Skype for about 3 years and love it. I would give it 5 stars except it drops calls sbout 3x a week.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints and if you loved &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; then you'll enjoy reading about what the characters are up to in the after math of the Carl Lee trail. A good read!
1401322786|5.0|I enjoyed it from cover to cover!  It had a very compelling story line. & was very relatable !!  Not a waste of the reader's time!
B004JHYRAE|5.0|This book makes me proud to be a slut. I just ended the longest relationship and made up my mind that it struggled because I knew in my heart I was polyamorous. Now I am an ethical slut with multiple partners who I am upfront with about my lifestyle
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series and truly enjoyed getting a glimpse into the lives of the wealthy as well as the lives of the ones who served them. This series really bring the characters to life and engages the viewer
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Could have been rated better, but have had two geothermal plant constructions disappear and 4 of the xt-atv's disappear. Aside from that, love it.
B00CM1S1QK|5.0|The best of Nina's early work beginning with her first album…..sublime grouping for the uninitiated and the long time fan.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It plays all my favorite videos but most of them freeze otherwise it's a good app I'd say  it's worth downloading.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book probably 5 or 6 times now. Seriously one of my favorites. Don't judge the story by the movie, the book is so much better (as usual).
B003GQM52Q|3.0|Too long to set up the action part of the story.  Even fell asleep at the end.  Give me &#34;Tombstone&#34; every time.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I love this movie!  I am not a big Daniel Craig fan, but I think he is an awesome 007!<br />This movie really gives some insight into the background of 007 which I really liked.<br /><br />I am pleased with the progression they have taken this films.
B00632HWOG|5.0|wonderful uncomplicated I wish all the apps I came acroos were this good and straight toward you don't need a Phd to figure out how to retrieve and send you mail
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As a reader of Nelson DeMille books i was excited to read the latest in the John Corey series. I was not disappointed. It was excited and funny as John Corey usually is. I was happy that it was not as gorey as the previous one was. A great read.
B00FQ53NIA|5.0|I'm no die hard Britney Spears fan by any means but this is by far her best album yet!  It's definitely a departure from what you'd expect from her and a pleasant surprise.  Her vocals sound more dynamic and in plenty of cases, down right beautiful.  The first single &#34;Work Bitch&#34; is really no representation of the whole album at all.  I would almost say that this is Britney Spears version of  Madonna's Ray of Light album.  I love it!  Definitely worth buying/downloading!!!
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|Big Arcade Fire fan. I know the Suburbs were a really tough one to follow up on, but I have listened to Reflektor many times - and can't really seem to get into it. Oh well, probably me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is my go to after having a  stressful day  once i get started i find myself playing for hrs. each  starts to get  complicated  but its still fun
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have read The Night Circus over and over. The tale never gets old and feels fresh every time. Highly recommend
B005544TRQ|4.0|Enjoy the show, storylines are pretty basic and characters are pretty one dimensional but cinematography, pacing, and music are all enjoyable.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This is one of my favorite sci-fi spoofs. The Star Trek motif is transparent but the story, dialog, effects, makeup, casting - all first rate. I'm not one for watching a movie more than once or twice but this is my fourth time for Galaxy Quest and I'll probably watch it again - just to enjoy sharing it with friends!
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|Time to watch Volume II again!  This is a classic that everyone should see, is it in your Top 100?
B007IXWL2C|2.0|A little to raw for me and not normal for the normal life style most people live.  How they can make a movie of this is beyond me.  Would not read again.
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|For the casual reader of Brosh's blog, this is well worth the read and a great introduction to her style. At times, the crude drawings are sheer genius. Her prose style isn't mind-blowing, but at times she'll offer an amazingly acute observation that the reader will forgive some of the clunkier ones. Brosh allows the reader a look into the mind's inner-workings, and the she doesn't sugarcoat anything. I applaud her honesty.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Absolutely the best, but then anything with Denzel Washington is great.  Like the movie says, Powerful and a great strength for people.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love, love,<br />Love these books! They are really enjoyable to read. Can't wait to read the next one, Mocking Jay!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love any Mahjong game.  Love the challenge of finding the pieces and I like to make exact matches or start the game over.  Every game I played and won were all exact matches.  Lots of fun.
B005CWRB44|2.0|Twist turn on is not near as good as push button on the back of these powerful portable flashlights, I would stick with another brand that does not require warranty work to be done in china, and has a different type of on/off switch..................
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Okay, I have played better games and this gets boring after a while.  This is a good game for kids to play.
B000W022XG|4.0|remember all those crappy portishead mp3's everyone had in like 1998?  this has all those dope songs on it plus some.  i think the mixing could have been better on some of the tracks - this album doesn't sound that great with a sub but its overall an excellent album
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love YouTube and use it a lot.  I use it to learn how to do knitting stitches I don't know and watch funny animal videos and on You Tube you can find anything you want to look at or learn.
B0064W67IM|5.0|there's a reason neil gaiman's books are so popular.  i think the sandman is how a lot of folks got their first taste of gaiman
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yay!! I can finally get rid of all my spam at once instead of going page after page deleting only a couple hundred @a Time!! Now I don't mind checking my mail!!!
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|If AMC decides that it's gonna be so limited that it's only gonna be available for purchase for one week before selling out, then screw them. I'm not gonna pay upwards of $550 for this because of some greedy people in this world. I wanted to buy this, but didn't have the money at the moment, and now that I do, it's sold out. It's sad because this series is such a masterpiece, but it's legacy will be tarnished by the greed of AMC.<br /><br />EDIT: I was able to find this to purchase thanks to B. Brown suggesting another retailer and to someone else for backing them up. I plan on changing my review completely after I receive this product.<br /><br />UPDATE: Unfortunately, this review will go back to it's 1-star rating. That listing for Family Video was an error and I just got an email saying that it's no longer available and my money has been refunded.
B004LDLI0S|4.0|Very scholarly treatment of an important milestone in 20th Century history.  Readable and well annotated.  Reading Mein Kampf is an exercise in discipline, but it does have valuable insights into some historical figures, human behavior in general, and pathology in social psychology.  The Ford Translation made this effort possible.
0307949508|4.0|An excellent continuation to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. It may lack some of the intrigue of Book 1 in the Millennium Trilogy, but the differences are negligible and bears no consequence on the readers ability to enjoy an extremely well written sequel to an extremely well written novel, within an extremely well written series!
B00FMJJ064|5.0|All I can say is give one of her songs a listen and if you like it buy the album. Lindsey has a unique blend of classical violin and dubstep. I'm actually not a fan of dubstep but for some reason she mixes it with her talents on violin to make some great music. Lindsey may just be the best musical artist our generation ever sees.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I am 3/4 through and nothing going on.My wife read it and told me to continue, things happen in the last 20 pages.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is just AWESOME. For the price tag it is just so convenient and exactly what we needed. We have always watched the majority of our TV on the computer since we don't have cable. This allows us to put Hulu, Streampix, etc on our television. I was so impressed that the sound goes right to the TV along with good picture quality. This does exactly what we needed it to do, and now we're watching our shows on a 46 inch TV instead of a little computer screen. I just hope all of the websites we use don't end up blocking this.... but it works for now! :)
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another winner by my favorite pair of authors! Pendergast surfaces just in time to deliver his justice and relieve my longing for another great story.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Need good depth perception to actually make hole in one's, but pretty easy to consistently get within a couple of lines of the hole, so I would day that's a fair difficulty.  Graphics ate actually pretty impressive for such a game, nicely rendered all around with variety, shows they really tried to make something nice.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love Downton Abbey….and now I love Upstairs Downstairs!  It's like the 1930's version, with lovable characters in both worlds.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Very cute show.  I enjoy most of the music and my daughter enjoys most of the drama.  Even my teenage boys, will stop scrounging around for food and will glance up from the kitchen to see what is going on each episode because it is just a funny and edgy show.  Humor and common teen issues rolled into one dysfunctional school.  There are days, I wish I could be Sue Sylvester...
039916409X|5.0|Ms. Lynch details mental, emotional and spiritual obstacles in our past and present which prevent our creating a wealthy future. And the author provides links to videos with tapping scripts as examples, along with links to online q&a opportunities. Thank you for your humor, insight and for these tools for transformation, Margaret
1400067820|4.0|A wonderful hypothesis that changed how I think.  That said, the book is all over the place and is certainly an example of non linear con cavity.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This was a great book.  I couldn't put it down. Fun reading and would definitely read something else by this author.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Great album. As a longtime fan of Britney's, I really think it's a solid effort from start to finish. Admittedly, it's much shorter than her previous efforts, especially the standard edition with only 10 tracks, so there's less room for filler.<br /><br />Personally, it's what Britney promised her fans. There are definitely some amazing personal songs like Alien [her best mid-tempo in a long time], Brightest Morning Star, and even the more dance-driven tracks like Now That I Found You [an even better version of Avicii's Wake Me Up, where this song seems to draw inspiration from], It Should Be Easy, and Till It's Gone. Then there's Hold On Tight, which is arguably the darkest song on the album. I've been waiting for a song like that from Britney for a LONG time and this song really delivered. Don't Cry is great as well, especially the verses and the whistle in the beginning [although it could use a stronger chorus].<br /><br />Obviously, it's not a Britney record without a few more sexually driven tracks and Body Ache & Tik Tik Boom definitely do the trick.<br /><br />Chillin' With You showcases Jamie Lynne's vocal talents. I didn't expect Britney's younger sister to be so pleasant in a track.
B008476HBM|5.0|I'm a thirteen year old girl and yet I couldn't understand it at times it was still a really good book. I choose this book because my teacher suggested it to me and our reading in school is for a grade. I decided to read it because it was the only thing that was in my reading level that looked interesting. (I have a high reading level.) The beginnings and the middle parts of the book gave me confused feelings. However the ending made complete sense of the plot and I must admit that it was a very clever, and very interesting ever for a girl my age. I do have to admit at my reading level, age, and skill it encouraged me to expand my vocabulary and my Language Arts skill. I love this book. I would recommend it to any one who loves Romatic books, a good plot, and/or is looking for a good book. :3
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Flick Golf Extreme is a Polished AIM and SHOOT style game that let's you shoot ball at Golf greens to get varying points.You Shoot and then adjust shot in mid-air by flicking Curves, Change of direction and even Backspin to land ball closer to center of target (Hole marked by Flag). Shot can be adjusted until 3rd bounce! Landing within measrured Distance Rings around the hole gives you points according to how close you land to the hole in the center of rings. Points and extra time are given for hitting the Flagpole, Curving it, Spinning the ball properly, etc. The HD Graphics are awesome with spectacular scenes. Controls work great with Fluid movements and Realistic Physics accuracy.<br /><br />NOTE: Pop-up messages sometimes disappear too fast.  Also, App does not Shut Down entirely after you EXIT... I use a TASK KILLER app to close it completely. It insalls CHARBOOST (Advertising Addon ) on your device. Fortunately it will PLAY WITH WiFi OFF!  Minus1 STAR because of these issues. Worth 3.5 Stars but I rounded to 4.<br /><br />Overall, a Fun game that is Engaging and Enjoyabl. A real treat after you learn how to vary your shots properly. Smooth Flicking controls with Fluid ball travel. The Scoring works nicely too. Addictive fun and good Replay Value. Music/Sound effects are neat and volume levels can be adjusted. A Pleasant app ( especially suited for Physics Game enthusists! ).

8866135704|5.0|I've used this moleskine for the last 5 years, couldn't live without it! Its compact enough that it can fit in your purse, and has enough space to write out what you need.
0767827716|5.0|Great classic great price and it will make a great xmas present For my great husband. Cant wait until he sees it
B00G70J81O|2.0|I thought this movie was terrible. Starts off well but goes down hill quickly when he gets to Japan. The plot made little sense and the action scenes were full of holes and simply added for the sake of stupid over the top stunts, which weren't even that visually impressive. Also the villain is poison ivy! Its like they stole the character from DC and made her a mutant. So lame. Don't waste your money.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|This will be the last Patricia Cornwell book I buy. Kay Scarpetta is whiny. Benton is so brilliant yet troubled (yawn). And of course the complex and so brilliant tortured lesbian niece Lucy. Marino has long overstayed his role. Why remind readers in every book he tried to rape her. Who would continue to let their would be rapist work for them? Only the forgiving Dr. Scarpetta. But my bigger reason for being finish with Cornwell was when she injected her politics into her books. When she started with her first comments against President Bush in Book of the Dead I started losing interest. Her beginning books we great reading. Now with this book did she have to bring the tragedy of Newtown into it?  And the great Dr. Scarpetta unselfishly helps with the autopsies. And so close to the anniversary of this tragedy. I find liberals very hypocritical. Obviously liberal in her thinking, yet Cornwell feels it necessary for Scarpetta to arm herself. I would think she would be so repulsed by guns. Anyway been there done that with Cornwell. No politics

0066620996|5.0|I had to read this book for a class assignment so I was not really looking forward to it but after the first chapter I was hooked. I believe that the two parts of this book that are the most important are Level 5 Leadership and the Hedgehog Concept. Prior to this book I was contemplating switching my leadership style at work. In the work environment I tend to be more quiet and really try to be a team player. I was thinking that I should start to really push myself ahead of everyone with a new approach. After reading this book I realized that I do not need to change anything all I need to do is to have a simple goal of where I want to be and work with my team to achieve that.<br /><br />The second part that I really enjoyed was the Hedgehog Concept. I believe that this concept can be applied to many different areas of one's life. The main thing I took from this part of the book is that it is better to be the best at one thing than good at others. This concept has really changed my perception on diversifying my background. I was currently thinking of finding another area at work that I can start to get good at so that I can know another field. After reading this book I came to the realization that I should focus on being the absolute best at what I already know.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Just looking for a free calculator, this one is only free if you are a Book Blast subscriber. Which I'm not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So My horse is an awesome app for kids. They are able to take care of horses and if they Do a good job and level up. Every time they level up they earn gems.

B00FATEJYE|4.0|I have been waiting for this game to come to android devices and I am so glad it is finally here! Played the console version a lot and this has been a great addition, doesn't hurt that it unlocks extra content on consoles &amp;#62;:-D Great game.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was book was much better than Sharp Objects. I could not stop reading this novel. I loved Gone Girl and this novel did not disappoint, but was riveting and suspenseful.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Not perfect but a big improvement over season 3. I enjoyed the new pacing in this season's episodes and the occasional focus on secondary characters. Looking forward to the second half!
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Patricia Cornwell has, through Kay Scarpetta become elitist and needs to remember the readers who brought her success are by and large not graduates of the Sorbonne or Harvard.<br /><br />Instead of a great whodunit her more recent books have been too involved with the psychology of Scarpetta and her damaged family.  The characters no longer are people to relate to.  Used to love her books but now, not so much.<br /><br />In addition, I might be missing something but I think it was a cheap shot for the author to capitalize on the Newtown killings.  That made me uncomfortable from the start.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Fascinating, thought-provoking, and moving, this is the most &#34;realistic&#34; zombie fiction I've read and I have read a lot of zombie novels.
B00G5G7K7O|2.0|Very disappointed, the story itself was quick and lacking. Olaf is about the only positive in the movie. It had moments of greatness then they started singing over and over and over. Don’t get me wrong a few songs are okay but Frozen takes it to a whole new level. It is like they threw the movie together and couldn’t figure out what to write for dialog, so they had singing replace it. I am a true cartoon buff and I am very disappointed with Frozen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|His game is awsome you can build you can destroy you can climb you can fall there aint nothin you cant do I love  this game try it out!
0792844890|1.0|I remember this movie being good as a kid, but now it pretty much sucked.  I'm glad I got it for cheap.
B00633W614|5.0|Once again, I loved this continuation of the Clifton saga.  Mr. Archer is the consummate story-teller.  Every character is well-defined; the book is almost impossible to put down.  There are really three protagonists:  Harry, Giles and Emma.  I like each so much I'm undecided as to who SHOULD receive the baronetcy.  I can't wait to find out how it turns out; but I don't want it to go by too rapidly because I don't want to leave these characters.
B00G9QLP9Y|2.0|Poor excuse for an app. Non-intuitive,  no function other than simple non-interactive display. Does not compare to PC or iPhone versions. Waste of download time and energy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful!  Happy I finished it before I saw the movie!  Written from the vantage point of the Grim Reaper, the book show the toll of Hitler on all people of Germany.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|interesting enough but not a grabber. Plot was somewhat evident early in the movie. Synopsis on the cover told it all.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Makes  compelling and interesting stories from events from Four months of one year linking one to the other...<br />A good read
B0063GORYU|4.0|I am addicted to this game. I like the way it plays on my phone best so don't play on the kindle very often.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Destroyed my love for the series.  Honestly, I wished I didn't see this final season as it ruined everything I loved about the series and the characters I loved watching.  EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Totally loooove this album. In my opinion not since Nirvana has there been a band come along with their own unolique sound, talent, look, humor and wit. Also love their vidios. The next big thing!
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|If you loved star trek, how Kirk is a good person, how the colors in the future are bright, or how Spock is a disciplined mind, or the beautiful image of a hopeful future, then this movie is NOT for you. The true fan can very easily see that this movie was not made by a Trekkie, but by someone who disliked the whole Roddenberry vision. The makers of this film thought that their meaningless regurgitation of generic Hollywood plot and dialogue was better than the sensitive and inspiring world of a true science fiction writer. The plot makes no sense. No continuity editing whatsoever.<br /><br />Kirk's eyes are fake contact blue in some scenes, just to be brownish in the next. In this movie they no longer show Kirk as an intelligent Captain who refers to Shakespeare and thinks deeply upon interpersonal meanings. This movie represents Kirk as an alcoholic man-slut who sleeps with two women at a time and listens to club/rap music. I guess the whole Kirk being a likable person is not as profitable as just showing the kids the new horrible role model that sells units in Hollywood today. Who cares that they're ruining yet another positive image? This is NOT Kirk. They missed the point of all the characters we've been developing for fifty years.<br /><br />Would anybody but a soulless Hollywood businessman imagine Scotty hanging out at the bar they show him in? Scotty is a likable old nerd who likes scotch and the hum of his engines, not hanging out in a thumping club for fashionable young people. No fan ever would have imagined this really stupid scene.<br /><br />Furthermore, in all the rest of Star Trek, whenever they show the Earth it is a calm and natural environment. We used to get the feeling that the future was something positive and better than today. This film shows a dark depressing Orwellian future, an all gray world of clubs, meaningless sex, and more bad music. The future of Earth in this vision is just a dark continuation of today's lowbrow shallow society. It is apparent that the makers of this film are either ignorant of Roddenberry's positive vision or that they are directly attacking it on purpose.<br /><br />They blatantly ignored the point of looking up towards a brighter future and instead made an allegory of today's stupid warlike culture here in a America. Interestingly the costumes are low quality, and by the end they are all literally lined up in what can only be described as Nazi uniforms. Oh, they took the time to remove the WWII symbols but that's about it. Nazi uniforms - hat and all.<br /><br />Also, there's the whole tribble problem. I'm not going to get into it too deeply, but let it be said that they include the tribble so we can do scientific testing on it! Great right?!? No. What they are really doing here is telling all actual fans that they have not watched and do not care about the previous fifty years of Trek mythos. Question: How can you have these creatures before your 5 year mission. Answer: Because we don't care about making sense. There are many more stupid examples of plot points that make no sense.<br /><br />Long story short: THIS IS NOT STAR TREK. It just looks like it occasionally and they use the say names. If you love Trek, skip this. You'll be glad you did. Worst movie yet.<br /><br />Maybe we need to admit it's better to let something end with the passing of the originators, than it is to just hand it off to next shallower generation of careless Hollywood businessmen.is apparent that the makers of this film are either ignorant of Roddenberry's positive vision or that they are directly attacking it on purpose.<br /><br />They blatantly ignored the point of looking up towards a brighter future and instead made an allegory of today's stupid warlike culture here in a America.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a book to get lost in when you don't want to have to learn something, or think too hard about what you are reading.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Great show with cool characters and interesting stories - I love it! Try this show if you like sci-fi (or even if you don't).
B00E193TM2|3.0|It's ok but probably not one that I will listen to over and over again. I got it for $2.99 on sale at the Amazon mp3 store so couldn't pass it up.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Saw this movie at the theater and loved it then. Had to buy it. Great family movie. Lots of humor. The colors were amazing, the plot highly entertaining. Wasn't sure when it first started if I would like it but turned out great.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and thought from the action clips this film was going to be another great flick. Not hardly, but enjoyable viewing.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I enjoyed this game,  but I would have liked it a lot more if it weren't 5.00.<br />Would love to see a cheaper price.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Very entertaining move I hadn't,seen in a long time.  W outdated be fun for kids and non violent. Take a look

B0081SRJSY|4.0|Fun game. Great way to practice when not playing in person with friends. Scoring sequence at the end of each game is incredibly long.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book! You have to read it!!! Best book ever! Buy it now u will love it very much! $o yeppp
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book offered hope in a world where it is so easy to lose it.  I couldn't put this book down until I finished it and though it was a sad story, it left me smiling.  It is amazing how strong we are and how focusing on the positives can lead you down a completely different road than if you felt sorry for yourself when anything went wrong.  I certainly took stock of my life and what is truly important after reading The Fault in our Stars.  This is a beautiful story of survival against impossible odds.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank goodness Candy Crush is finally available on the Kindle.  I've never been able to put this game down when playing.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|What a sweeping, picaresque story!  Tartt captures a young boy in tragic circumstances and, through an alchemy of language, transforms him into a tortured orphan, a lover of beauty and a prisoner, so like the little bird he so I admired and identifies with.  THEO Decker is the GOLDFINCH.  They are chained yet each accepts his fate.  A remarkable book, one I won't forget.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy to use I don't use it much but it works great when I do.th ed is only so much you can say about nothing.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|great series with original ideas and stories but holds to the traditions of the Science fiction areas it is in.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I loved this book because it describes me and others I know so well.  I've been punished being the way that I am all my life; this helps me to understand myself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I get am completely hooked. I think all my friends should play so we could help one another out with lives
B009GEAPYW|5.0|one of the bets batman  animated films I have see if you have not see this movie you need own this one
B00BGI086Q|1.0|Cheap utterly predictable carbon copy of Batman. The many 5-star reviews show more than anything else the successful dumbing down of America's sheeple.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague inc.is a fun and very entertaining and challenging game that makes think and have to take many factors into consideration overall it's a fun and entertaining game
B00FLDG5BE|1.0|...the audio and video are great....but way out of synch...I spent hours with my A/V sync to try to get it in synch...finally checked here and realized what everyone else has. Eric, if you knew how bad the synch is, you wouldn't want your name on it...and i have every one of the Crossroads<br /><br />On further review it appears that the DVD authors were completely inexperienced. My guess is that someone with a  copy of Final Cut Pro and DVD Studio convinced someone that he/she/they could author the DVD. The tipoff, other than the terrible sync is that when you go to Songs, each \\"page\\" starts out with the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. which is the DVD Studio default. Anyone with an ounce of understanding would know to number the pages in consecutive order.<br /><br />Completely unimaginable...
B001H1SVO8|4.0|Rule number one do not talk about fight club.<br />Rule  number two do not talk about fight club.<br /><br />Its Fight Club.<br />its Fight Club.<br />We are the middle children of history.<br />Single serving friend.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Simply excellent. Great book on Bezos, Amazon and how to build a great company, with a great customer service culture.
030758836X|4.0|I loved the book, I couldn't put it down until I reached the end... but the ending is just horrible!
0316069515|5.0|I have no idea how he does it, but Michael Connelly (MC) keeps writing wildly entertaining novels. Even with a long list of good and great novels behind him, \\"The Gods of Guilt\\" is easily one of his best. I started reading MC with The Concrete Blonde\\", not just a Harry Bosch novel but ultimately a great courtroom thriller. As much as I enjoy Bosch, I've come to love Michael Haller even more, perhaps because I love courtroom thrillers more than police procedurals. \\"The Gods of Guilt\\" starts off with an awesome scene in a courtroom and speeds on from there, setting everything up and then, in the second half of the novel, it's a firecracker of a courtroom thriller, with terrific surprises and jolts all the way through. I also love how MC references novels and characters from the past novels, even though you could easily read this as your first MC novel and enjoy it immensely. If I had a complaint, it is that it is too short! Only because I was enjoying it so much: when I looked at the book and realized there were only 50 pages left, I was very disappointed. Just terrific.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun!  And the minions are cool. I recommend this game for anyone who likes the minions.
B000002KIK|5.0|One of my favorite Sabbath albums. It's kind of sad that this one went under the rock radar and got such little attention-especially when released.
