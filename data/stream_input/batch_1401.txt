B00756GKBA|5.0|I've read other reviews from people on the album...  the negative ones seem to talk about how she's \\"empty\\" and/or \\"uninspired.\\"  However I disagree...  in this album there is something for all Madonna fans.  \\"Gang Bang\\" - \\"Love Spent\\" - \\"Masterpiece\\" ...and you say it's empty?  Anyway, during recent interviews Madonna said when she started recording the album she wanted one thing...  to make the world smile and dance again.  Mission Complete in my opinion!  Like Nicki Minaj said \\"There's only one queen and that's Madonna...  Betch!\\"  Biggest disappointment?  Having to wait till September 4 to see her live in Boston, MA!
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|It's pretty cute, not too long and good story. :) I think adults would enjoy it just as much as kids.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Every time I exit the game, it crashes the HTC Sense interface on my Rezound, causing the home screens to have to reload. No other app does this, not even the first Cut The Rope. Great game none the less.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have a kindle fire, and this works great on it. I love how you can just tap the book, chapter, and verse to get to a passage, instead of having to type in the whole reference.<br /> I also like the plans that it comes with. It makes it so much easier to read. Before I got this, I was having a hard time finding a place to read, but now, this has very nice plans to do that for you, probably better than you could yourself.
B003EYVXV4|1.0|What is it that everyone else was supposed to see in this snore fest that I missed, that was SO damn compelling and interesting? I don't get it. This movie is too drawn out, boring, very average, and WAY over-hyped. I get why it's the next Twilight-esk fad tho, it's because it's an overrated POS where teenage girls find characters attractive, and so instead of watching a movie for what it is, it's based on other facts.<br /><br />So the plot of this thing is that in the future, something happened like a war of some kind, and now the rich people live in the cities, and the poor live in district villages where, each year two people from each District will be chosen to fight in honor and sacrifice themselves for some stupid tribute to the battle that was won. It's now a stupid reality TV show. Boy do so many of us hate Reality TV.<br /><br />I was forced into watching this with my g/f, and I thought, it may be ok, it sounds something like \\"The Running Man\\"... but no, the Running Man is actually entertaining... this movie right here, I was just about falling asleep during the first hour from boredom as it sets up who this main actress is playing the starring role, and her useless love interests; also how they live etc... B O R I N G. Get to the action already. So FINALLY, something starts to happen and you get to see that in the future, the rich people are all fashiontards, except for Woody Harrilson who hasn't had a decent hairstyle in a movie since \\"White Men Can't Jump\\".<br /><br />Once these \\"games\\" begin, you see it's nothing but a boring run through the meadows and into the trees as they hunt and kill each other to be the last person/s standing. Sounds more interesting than it is. Expect to see the typical, \\"I don't want to be a killer\\" thing to happen from the ones who become the final contenders. Everything was predictable and convenient... watch the movie if you must, and tell me you didn't know what was coming? One survivor with a heart of gold... get real.<br/><br />Over hyped, Overrated, Over Budgeted, Over-Kill... eckkk... but that's Hollyweed these days, so I expect this dribble will be drawn out with a million more useless sequels based on the books this fecal matter was wiped out on. I expect teeny-boppers can't wait to go and waste money on the next installment because \\"oh, he's so cute\\" is back on the big screen. But I know now for sure, I won't be bothering to ever see any sequels for this useless rubbish of over-hyped etc, etc...<br /><br />The thing that really annoyed the most was that none of these killers are even trained to kill, they are more picked at random out of a hat, and yet hardly any of them seemed to protest against wanting to be a part of what, in the end, if you win, you get a crown on TV... and the winner just accepts the crown with a smile, and goes back home like nothing happened? Reality of the situation would probably be mental therapy for years for being forced to kill or be killed, and whats even worse, people sitting around in the audience eating their popcorn and smiling like they where meant to buy into this $#!*. Gimme a break, are you people even aware of what you are watching, or did you just like the boys in tight pants and the shinny objects flickering in your face?<br /><br />This has got to be the #1 most overrated POS of the year. Sorry if you don't agree, but that's how I saw it... a poorly thought out, over-hyped piece of garbage yet again going from book to movie.
B0061S073A|5.0|Just what I needed for my Kindle Fire!  My 2 year old loves to play on my kindle and this app limits him to the apps that I pick for him to play.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Forget about being annoyed they remade an excellent 2009 adaptation. This version is excellent as well. Let yourself enjoy it. This version helps celebrate a great story, a great character, and a great author. That should be celebrated.  Especially with all the junk that is turned into movies now.
B004FJJGBG|5.0|It took 13 years for James Cameron to make his next movie after Titanic and now after waching AVATAR, it is worth all that wait. Avatar is by far the greatest movie in recent times and will probably remain so for a long time.

B007KQXB2G|4.0|I imagined this free show to merely be a couple minutes of highlights from the show. It turned out to be a pretty interesting discussion of leadership and how Don Draper exudes those qualities on the show. Anyone familiar with Mad Men will likely find this special interesting for the insights it gives into why we like or dislike Don as a character. It also gives us a chance to think about our own careers and the choices we make.<br /><br />And best of all...this show is free!
B004NSULHM|5.0|Radiohead = happiness! I just saw them live and a majority of it was repertoire from this album!  My favorite so far:  Lotus Flower, Codex and Little By Little!  The others are fantastic, too.  Some of the best drumming! Was very pleased!!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Good CG and a cracking storyline that thinly disguises a rehash of the Dances With Wolves theme. The aliens are big, green American Indians (looking rather Pawnee to me) with tails, who gather their 2000 braves (Just like Little Big Horn. Fancy) and beat General Custer - sorry, Colonel Miles Quaritch - when he rashly attacks their camp. The American marine who assumes an alien body, his avatar, and joins them to learn more about them predictably discovers that the simple one-with-goddess-gaia lifestyle is much more preferable to the machine-centred existence he has hitherto led. The alien beasties are straight out of Pitch Black and the terrain reminds me strongly of Skull Island in the latest remake of King Kong. Hollywood moviemaking is definitely a fast food industry - there are only half a dozen ingredients available, so reshuffle them as you can...
0061478784|5.0|I am a bookworm! (truth) I have read too many books to count and when I read Howl's Moving Castle, It became my most favorite book by far. Once I get it back from my friend I will most certainly read it again! >.< The movie is also extremely awesome.
B00756GKBA|5.0|The new album is a very good listen!  Music is smooth, melodic, and has pulsating beats that will get you dancing.  Madonna teams up again with William Orbit and has produced a great new album.  I'm very much looking forward to seeing the 2012 World Tour later this year in Atlanta.  \\"I'm Addicted,\\" is to \\"M.D.N.A.,\\" what \\"Skin,\\" was to \\"Ray of Light.\\"  Madonna proves she is the Queen of Pop!

B00005JKHN|5.0|Two things stand out to me watching this film as an adult:<br /><br />1. How is it possible that after 16 years of living like mortals, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather have no clue how to bake or sew? There's no reason they should have gotten caught.<br />2. Why did they take Aurora back to the castle on her 16th birthday? After all those years of heartbreaking separation, 16 years and one day seems like no big deal and a lot safer.<br /><br />I love this movie because Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain. She is pure evil, but she is an amazing work of art. Disney always makes their villains so creative. The princesses usually look alike: small nose and chin, big eyes, long hair (typically), and a perfect body. Sidekicks and smaller characters are a little more unique: they get the big noses, huge chins, short squishy bodies, and proportions that even the most unattractive real-life people are not unfortunate enough to be blessed with. But the villains... they range from amazing to creative to unique to just plain weird. (Look at someone like Yzma in [[ASIN:B0060CV31C The Emperor's New Groove]]!) But Maleficent is the one who has always fascinated me the most. She's gorgeous even though she looks like a devil. There are times when you can't help sympathizing with her even though she's the bad guy. It's because you can tell she's lonely. And, like the fairies put it, she does not understand love. She has never been loved.<br /><br />Besides that, Eleanor Audley does the most amazing job ever as Maleficent. She's the quintessential villain voice. I guess that is why they used her again for the wicked stepmother in [[ASIN:B0007Z9R7A Cinderella (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]... another favorite villain of mine. It's a shame that they did Cinderella III so many years later that none of the original actors were around. Although whoever did the stepmother's voice did a pretty decent imitation. (I really think there should be a time limit on sequels. Cinderella III was OK but Cinderella II totally sucked.) Oh, and if you ever watch [[ASIN:B0000V4906 Green Acres: The Complete First Season]], you will not be able to watch Eleanor Audley without hearing Maleficent!but Cinderella II totally sucked.) Oh, and if you ever watch [[ASIN:B0000V4906 Green Acres: The Complete First Season]], you will not be able to watch Eleanor Audley without hearing Maleficent!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the bomb and itttttttssss realllllllyy fuuuuuuuuuunnnnnn and, cooooooooolllllll I hope they name another one cause its really funnn
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Worth TWICE what I paid - Downton Abbey is the best TV I have viewed in 10 years.  Wonderful.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I'm not shooting for a comprehensive review.  Other front page reviews have covered most of those issues.  I just wanted to throw in my $.02.<br /><br />If you get the chance, buy this cut.  The movie is more solid than any other version out there.  I think that the addition of all the cut material and the interwoven Tales of the Black Freighter, this is the closest thing to the comic that you should ever expect.  I am a huge fan of the original source material, and (while I saw the theatrical version when it opened and I loved it) I could not be happier with my experience.<br /><br />I take that back.  I could be slightly happier.  Tales of the Black Freighter was interwoven into the film, and is the only thing that they didn't throw into this comprehensive edition.  I wish that I had the option to watch it as a stand-alone feature.  As far as I can tell this isn't an option.<br /><br />I purchased this on pre-order.  While I'm pleased that my copy seems to be worth so much now I have no intention of selling.  I love it so much that I hope it is rereleased so that everyone can enjoy it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Nice game<br />shouldn't connect to open feint automatically n shouldn't remind you to rate the app every now n then

B0053KWDES|5.0|Let me start by saying that I've never used or owned a headphone amp before.<br />I chose this one based on the good feedback here on Amazon. I received it in the mail three days ago, and cracked it open immediately. It came with the amp, the wall charger, an extra battery, a USB cable for charging, and the in-line connector.<br /><br />First impression:<br />It's a well built device, very light, and seemed easy enough to use. Without charging it, I plugged it in and let it go. I listen to a lot of EDM (Glitch Hop, Drum and Bass, Downtempo, Breakbeat and a bit of Dub). I tried it out on a few tracks, changing the settings a couple times while they were playing. Some of the tracks seemed to be a bit bass-heavy and fuzzy no matter what the settings were at. I credit that to poor mixing and/or low bit-rate.<br /><br />Currently I'm using a set of ATH-M30's at home and some stock Samsung earbuds that came with my phone, on the go. Not the greatest set up, but they get the job done. With the M30's, the sound quality overall is not DRASTICALLY improved, but there is definitely a noticeable difference. With the earbuds however, it's hard to believe that it's the same pair. They go from being a flat, dull, and boring set to a set that you'd think cost upwards of $50-$60.<br /><br />I like that it's compact, and easy to carry. I currently have mine velcro'd to the back of my iPod. It adds to the size, no doubt, but it's nothing that isn't manageable.<br />I don't like that I feel like I'm gonna break it when I'm taking the back off to change the battery. Hasn't happened yet, and from the reviews I've read, I don't think it's something that can be expected. I also don't like that you can't use it when it's plugged into the charger. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an improvement in their listening experience. However I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who is looking for a top-notch pro-quality amp.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought the game was a nice game for most ages me and my little brother enjoy the fun and easy games!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|The new game itself is great. Like other reviews said not just a clone of the original. The use of the gravity field is fun. But couldn't they come up with more levels before it was released ! I went through all the levels in one day. I'm sure there will be add ons at some point but for $2.99 ( since kindle fire owners cannot purchase the 99 cent version ) I would expect more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! I don't normally bother writing reviews for much but this one deserves it. I think its a really creative alternative to cell phone alarm clocks. its so customizable, more so then I even need most times. I love the math problems setting, definitely wakes me up, lol. also the option to shake your device to snooze or dismiss is great. best of all, its been reliable every morning for months now. I have not had any problems with battery drain like someone recently said. the ads are placed in a spot where it might accidentally be clicked but I am careful and haven't done it. this is the free version, for no ads, just buy the pro!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The app is great! It is just as much fun as the computer version, with all the convenience of portability.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. It is engaging and challenging without being stressful.  You need to think through these puzzles, you can't just tap until you brute force through.  Very entertaining! Well worth the dollar!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book really caught my intrest. I couldnt stop reading it because it  was so good! I love the hunger games!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app I use it every day. So does my mom and my sister and my dad too.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great quality backpack. Its cheap price and high quality. The product is small. how ever it holds a good amount of stuff it holds 3-4 lenses and one body with a flash. The bag can hold a canon or nikon 70-200 attached to the camera and a flash its also has tripod holder on the outside of the bag. This bag however does not hold a laptop nor does it have a rain coat (all weather protection pull over). out side of that is great for what it is the quality is outstanding I recommend it for those with 2-3 lenses and a camera body and a flash. the only thing I didnt like was that the camera bag has amazon written all over the zippers no big deal tho just know that when buying it. Hope my review help
B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill have several masterpieces over the years. The '80s was the best decade and even the '90s was great but I was slightly disappointed with Necroshine, Bloodletting and I Hear Black. Not that they were bad albums but they could've been better and they proved it with '03 album, Killbox 13. Iron Bound is when they made their true return to form and these 2 are their best efforts since 1991 Horrorscope. Overall, I like The Electric Age better though. They experimented with their music in the past and I enjoyed it too but they're better when they returned to their '80s thrash/speed roots. Electric Age is the best album of the year I've heard so far and it's a must have.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|To me this was an excellent movie.  The actors were fantastic and it was really a beautiful movie although hauntingly sad.  I love ghost stories and stories that focus past the visible realm and make you think.  This one did just that.  It is one that will stick with me for a long time.  I had seen the trailer and read reviews, but I can honestly say the movie itself is well worth watching.  Even if you know the ifs, ands, and buts of the story, the movie was still an excellent watch and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  It is one of those movies that make you appreciate the people and good things in your life just a little bit more and make you realize the emptiness that would replace that if you suddenly lost those people or things.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Got into this show via netflix, and couldnt wait for season 2 so i picked up this blu ray set. Great stories, wonderful ensemble cast, terrific music and beautiful cinematography. What else is there to say? If you liked the first season youll love season 2.
B000JMKO3C|4.0|This is agreat read and something a lttle bit different. The main character she ends up in a mental hospital and its amazing to see the affect she has on everyone.
1250006341|5.0|I'm completely addicted to this wonderful series and couldn't wait to view it again, all at once.  It helped me pass the time until the next season came out!
B005K17RU0|2.0|app doesn't open everytime! Very frustrating! when it works, its great.... but when it doesn't its a pain...:( I'd give it a &quot;2&quot; out if 5 stars.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This movie was great I am a huge fan of The Twilight Saga and have watched this several times and can't wait for part 2.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great productivity app.  Actually makes my tablet a productive tool. Occasionally lags but a generally handy and brilliant app.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This game delivers the same fun as the original; infact i believe this game is better than original angry birds. The are only 60 levels i believe, which is nothing; just finished it in one day.  i cant wait to see another level of this space fun.<br />Please please please download this app. its fun.
B00756GKBA|5.0|The Madonna I grew up loving is back. Where to start? I'm going to list my favorites:<br /><br />1. I'm a Sinner-I love the 60's feel. The lyrics are a lot of fun also. A solid dance tune.<br />2. Gang Bang-It reminds me of Thief of Hearts, not in melody, but in fierce attitude. Love it.<br />3. Some Girls-I'm loving this one also. I hear Debbie Harry 80's on this one. Another fun track.<br />4. Love Spent-Wow. Banjo...electronica... This song has an interesting arrangement and completely changes at about the 2:08 mark. Love this song.<br />5. I'm Addicted-A solid dance hit.<br />6. Give Me All Your Luvin'-This one has grown on me now that I've heard the whole album.<br />7. Girl Gone Wild-Dance Hit!<br />8. Beautiful Killer-Another hit that sounds like it's from another decade.<br />9. Masterpiece-Gorgeous ballad. The Remix is hot also.<br /><br />I love the whole album, but I find myself repeatedly going back to the aforementioned songs. She's a living legend...the Queen of Pop...and this album leaves no doubt. It's been nice watching Madonna mature through the years, and when I see her in interviews  now she has a poise and sophistication that no other pop stars possess.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|Everyone did fantastic job in the movie. at times i felt movie went down the hill, but soon picked it up. The story was good. Interesting movie, I recommend watching it. The main reason i watched this movie is because it is directed by Client Eastwood.<br />i give this movie a solid 6 out of 10.
B0078JP5SS|5.0|My husband and I love this series!  It is beautifully set in pre-WW I England and transports us authentically to the times. The heartbreaking years of the Great War and its after- effects on the British class system and women are poignantly explored. Superbly acted by the entire cast, it provides an intelligent and heartfelt story. We can't wait for more episodes!
B001UV4XFG|4.0|The version I received actually went back because it was the Canadian version of the film with English and French on the DVD case. I may have been biased after receiving the DVD and being annoyed about that, but the quality also seemed sub-par. I watched a few minutes and it was very dark. We had rented the movie not too long prior to purchasing and I don't recall it being that dark. I think I'll just spend a little more and get it locally.<br /><br />Overall, great move and series, my wife loves them all so far.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|So I paid the 2.99 and I have to say not bad. I do enjoying playing it.....but....to find out that the ipad has the same game with more levels is kind of disappointing. this will not stop me from playing but I wont pay 2.99 again.
0439023521|5.0|I read this right before the movie came out, and I loved it! Amazon is a great place to get cheap books, and I am so glad I bought this book for so much less than at barnes and noble!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was beautifully written.  Although at times sad and you felt like Denny would never catch a break, the fact that Enzo, through everything was there for him.  As a dog owner, there are times where I feel like my dogs understand me so much more than any human, and having a book from the dogs perspective is refreshing and entertaining.<br /><br />While I cried at the end (I knew I would) first they were tears of sadness, but then tears of joy.  I laughed throughout the book and barely could put it down.  If you are a lover of animals, this is a wonderful book.  Just be prepared with a box of Kleenex.
B002ZNJW0O|4.0|My friend reccommended this book to me and I liked it! Definitely not the best book ever though. It was priced awesomely here on Amazon and I'm glad I bought it!
B005ZUR724|5.0|while its pretty much a wow clone, its an admirable one. The game is fun and responsive, visuals are decent. A little grindy at the beginning and somewhat hard to track quests, but it gets easier at higher levels.
1416583432|1.0|This book was just awful. It was poorly conceived and badly planned. It's as though the author had no plan for the book when she started. I've tried to get half way through this book several times now, and I can't do it. I get the feeling that the author thinks I am an idiot.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|who would give it one star! (crazy people) this game is the best of angry birds Rio, seasons, and regular version! it's so worth the moola$$$
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|get ready here comes the breaking sounds..........the angry birds are the people who never played save your money up and buy you a tablet you get to download your angry birds that's. my bit. what's yours?
0307959856|2.0|I wonder whether P.D. James really wrote this book; it is not up to her usual level.  I never cared about any of the characters, and the plot line was a let down.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop. I have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58. While I did not have either one of those to do an a/b comparison - I DID have 2 high-end (over $100 mics) to compare these too. One was an EV and the other a rather costly older Peavey. These mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response. The signal was not quite as hot as the EV and Peavey, but far more resistant to feedback - even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2. Can't speak to their longevity or reliability yet, but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment. I feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks. Great value & highly recommended.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Saw this in the theater and was absolutely blown away. I just had to buy the Blu-ray. Picture quality and sound is excellent, with some added bonus features.

B0058VW36U|3.0|well this is a fun game and all, but there isn't a lot of levels. and once you beat like the first three stages you wont wanna play it because it gets really hard to get all stars. overall it is a good game, and I  would still buy it if I were you!!!!
0060763280|1.0|This is same old stuff everybody else talks about.You are what you think and you can do anything you set your mind to. The information in the book i can get that by wathching oprah for free and not get the smart ass comments about poor people that was in the book. Hes just another person that happened to get rich because he figured out how to scam people out of money at his semianrs.He makes it sound like people can start big business even if they are poor,so..i want to start flipping houses i live pay check to pay check am i suppose to pull the money out my ass? also, he's very arrogant when he talks about poor people.Get a persoanlity.I'm glad i bought this book used.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|The Muppets are back and better than ever. Jason Segal and his crew worked tirelessly to bring the Muppets back to the silver screen. Not only did they capture the humor and charm that made the Muppets so special, Segal and crew gave the Muppets staying power in the the 21st century.<br /><br />Many Muppet die hards, including performer Frank Oz, were not particularly happy with the script because they thought some of the jokes were too low brow for the Muppets. Unfortunately the great Frank Oz may have succumb to traditionalism and could not see the jokes that were inside the jokes. For some, the glory days will always be yesterday no matter what.<br /><br />This is a fantastic movie. This combo blu-ray/dvd/digital copy pack is amazing. There are so many extras which are a real treat to every Muppet fan young and old.<br /><br />A must buy!
B003L8GPT8|2.0|I expected a really nice re-issue of this outstanding concert. Yes, it´s 180 heavy vinyl, but the sound is terrible, it´s a cd with vinyl-shape, it has nothing to do with the original lp.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|very fun game. needs more itmes that cook faster and more of the product. I also need neighbors though so add me mollyw727 :)
0439023513|1.0|What a huge waste of my time!  I loved the first and second books, but I really thought that Collins would develop Katniss into someone that could be looked up to, not looked upon with disgust.  Overall I though that Katniss spent more time crying or in the hospital or running away than actually doing anything heroic.  I also feel like at the end, the author got tired of writing and threw a bunch of junk in to \\"try\\" and make the book more enthralling.  Well, I will probably never pick up another one of your books.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I understand that some people aren't going to like this film, and it certainly isn't for everyone. However, I found this film to be, for lack of a better word, amazing. Everything from the cast to the editing was ingenious. The characters are pretty close to their original literary counterparts and even though the ending was changed up a bit, it stuck much closer to the source material than the previous adaptation. This Blu-ray release has top-notch video and audio, and has hours of bonus features that I can't wait to watch. Personally, I like this film better than the Swedish adaptation, but to each his/her own. I am a little bummed that we're getting an Ultra Violet copy instead of a normal digital copy, but I think I'll manage just fine without it. And for those who were confused about how the DVD looks like a DVD-R, that's kind of the whole point (it's in the film and the subsequent novels), and plus it's easily recognizable that it's an actual DVD (just look on the right-hand side where it says it's a DVD, is rated R, etc.). Overall, it's a fantastic Blu-ray release and I'm certainly looking forward to \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\"
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I first started the Hunger game books I wasn't to sure what I was getting into. When I got to the end of the first book I couldn't wait for the next one. This book will have you fighting for the cause!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I really love this book.  I actually didn't know that the books existed until I watched the series.  The books are much better!  The series left a lot of stuff out and changed the story a lot.  Great read!  I recommend the first and second book to everyone. I'm sure once I finish the rest of them I will be recommending the series.
0525423656|4.0|I have to admit I was skeptical going in to this book.  I had read so many mixed reviews that I was expecting to be disappointed and maybe that's why I wasn't.  Although I found Matched a bit derivative and formulaic I really enjoyed it anyway and I was excited to read the next installment.  I am a fan of Ky so I appreciated that half of the book is told from his perspective. I found his character well-developed and interesting and I was invested in the romance between he and Cassia. Xander was mostly side-lined in this book but there are some interesting, albeit not shocking, revelations about him.<br />I agree with some of the other reviews that not a whole lot happens in this book.  I found it to be more set-up and character development centered than plot-driven but since I was invested in the characters and enjoyed getting to know them on a deeper level I didn't mind.  Overall, I ended up really enjoying this book.  It was a quick read and I'm looking forward to reading Reached in the Fall.

If you watch the first movie and don't get hooked, they you simple don't like movies outside your box.  The final comment is that the 1st movie was great, but the 3rd topped them all.  Show me a trilogy that does this!
0071762345|4.0|Likeable Social Media, is an successful attempt by Dave Kerpen to explain usage of Social Media, especially facebook to maximize the business benefit any marketing strategy.<br /><br />Dave has used examples from his experience which most of the experts (sic!) from Social Media Marketing domain lack. The book is clearly written with lots of examples woven. Each chapter has exercise in the end which encourages readers to act on the learning's.<br /><br />This book is must read for any business owner, social media marketing executives.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|I enjoyed the book very much and for the past several months have anticipated its adaptation to the screen.<br /><br />So is it worth it? I would say so. The book is much better(as in most book to movie translations)but it did entertain and stay true to the book. Only a few minute changes were made, that's all, I wont say what. What I will say is that 'It did not show enough violence', yes, its PG-13, but we know the consensus, show the brutality of what the future dystopia is like.<br /><br />The camera movement was awful and inconsistent at times, as well as the editing, which disrupted the flow of the story. I do not recommend doing a sequel, but I'm sure its inevitable.<br /><br />The only really good accomplishment is the cast and the acting. There were great performances in here, this keeps you in the film(No Twilight acting here) I was touched and my eyes may have had a slight discharge at the Rue and Katniss scene, which was done wonderfully. Peeta and Katnis had great chemistry together and fine performances by Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks was superb as Effie Trinket. Not enough Cinna, but Lenny Kravitz was great.<br /><br />It was OK but no 'Battle Royale' or 'Lord Of The Flies'

B007KQXB2G|1.0|Worth less than free! I was very disappointed in this waste of time. The first two business people shown at the beginning were quite annoying; preachy, full of rah-rah management slogans. These are the phonies I make a point to avoid day-to-day.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|Amazed after finally reading this story how little the movies take from it. The Amazon reviews are spot on, I got used to the characters rambling across the lands and figured that Shelley was just trying to beef up her word count with a few entries from her travel blog. And it's true there are no details going from Frankenstein the student to Frankenstein the mad scientist to - oh look, he created a monster. You have to pull it out from between the lines of about half a page. It was why I finally read the book, I wanted to see how she brought the monster to life, but, there's nothing. Frankenstein just goes collecting bits and pieces and presto-chango, a freak is born. But, the good news is, this monster's got a lot more going on than the movie versions. He seems much more hideous looking, which I think is cool. He has Spiderman abilities to move thousands of miles and track Victor on all his many ramblings. This monster is a thoughtful, conflicted man with a plan. He just needs a good woman to set him straight.

0545405777|3.0|Just read it. Takes about an hour. It's not a bad book, you know it's going to be predictable going in, so get past that. It does a nice job with setting up locations and the characters are all driven along nicely enough, however some of the plot holes would need a couple of tar-trucks to fill.
B003Y5H5EW|1.0|This movie is absolutely crap. One of the worst IV parts I have ever seen for a saga, if not the worst.  The original trilogy was a very unique kind o story, but this is basically 1 and a half hours of  continuos slaughter with no plot at all.  The worst part is that it's going to be a fifth one. Terrible!! I would have given this 0 stars if that would have been posible.

B004EPZ0AM|4.0|I was hesitant to see Happy Feet Two, but by the end of the movie, I was more than pleased. I liked the first film, but didn't \\"love\\" it. I felt they focused a bit too much on singing, not enough on story. Musicals are fine in my book, but at times it felt like Kidz Bop with penguins. That, and the ending left a bit to be desired.<br /><br />Happy Feet Two? Pleasantly surprised. The film was well executed, integrating a fantastic mix of humor, family and a lil' dash of drama within a pleasant black and white wrapper. Especially given that this movie, unlike the first, really didn't force a message on you with its ending.

1455113557|5.0|Thank you Amazon reviewers, for giving \\"Defending Jacob\\" such a good rating with so many reviews. It encouraged me to read this book and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />This is the very first review I've ever written before I've even finished a book that I love. What I'm doing here is complete junkie behavior, looking for more from this author because when I run out of this book, I already know I am going to have withdrawal symptoms and want more Landay. I might just turn the whole book over and read it again from the start.<br /><br />So well-written, with understated flair and savvy, and a deep understanding of the teenage mind. Even more aptly for me, he writes with a profound understanding of the mind of the parent of a teenager. The protagonist's wry observations of teenage behavior combined with his intense and protective parental love is a combination of emotions I have never encountered before in fiction. He breaks the rules of fiction in a way that only makes the book more compelling, such as casually dropping the name of the \\"real killer\\" in such a way that I'm pretty sure he's not lying, but still feel like I'm guessing. He plays with time like that, like a guy telling you his story over a cup of coffee. Landay is so interesting that I could read this book for days in utter joy even if nothing ever happened. He could get away with simply being entertaining because he is that good, but he doesn't; he is better than that, and the plot moves along with a thrilling crackle that reminds me of Lee Child. Landay has a wonderful mastery of language that gives me the same sense of wonder I get when I read poetry. For example (and this is off the top of my head), he describes a teenager \\"sloping\\" along; he describes the protagonist's rising anger by detailing the sense of autonomy and tension in the punching arm of the protagonist. This type of language and writing fills the book, using an economy of words that is truly poetry, but Landay's compelling writing makes it nearly impossible for me to take a breath and stand in wonder at the craftsmanship, because I just want so much to know what happens next.<br /><br />Read by Grover Gardener, who is pretty much my all-time favorite male narrator. He has a very gentlemanly and precise way of reading, which really brings out both the humor and the horror in this book.s it nearly impossible for me to take a breath and stand in wonder at the craftsmanship, because I just want so much to know what happens next.<br /><br />Read by Grover Gardener, who is pretty much my all-time favorite male narrator.

B0076XDGZ0|5.0|Frequently, supergroups produce some of the least \\"super\\" and most underwhelming music out there. More often than not, we see great players and creative minds collaborating on albums with one another, only to discover, upon hearing these records, that none of the individual member's defining characteristics have been preserved.  Instead, these supergroups-- the Chickenfoots of the world-- produce music that's bland and colorless; that is simply \\"there\\"; that is, without a doubt, \\"less than the sum of its parts.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, that is NOT the case with this new album. Instead, this record is some of the most inspired playing and most creative music that I've heard from any of the artists involved in quite some time. It is not watered down in the slightest, as supergroups tend to be. Nor can it be caricatured one way or the other; as \\"prog rock\\" or anything else. It defies labels. It is, simply put, five guys with unique attitudes toward music coming together to produce something genuinely fresh, new, and exciting. Sometimes it's prog, or metal, or 70's/80's rock, but listening to it you always get the sense that these five guys are playing this music and making it their own-- rather than coming down to from their expertise to play as studio-guys. Everyone shines here, and everyone's going all out. That maybe is why it's called \\"Flying Colors\\".<br /><br />Though I initially had my reservations that this album would simply become another Neal Morse solo project, that has not been the case. Neal's contributions are apparent, but the primary singer/songwriter here seems to be Casey McPhereson, who I sincerely hope will make this project the main outlet for his creativity henceforth.  Although, at this point, I'm not sure who is responsible for which songs, the songwriting here is top-notch. Though many songs deal with the same religious themes fans of Neal Morse will be familiar with, at no place is this album as overtly \\"biblical\\" as Neal's solo-work. The thematic range is much broader- there are love-songs, songs about hardship, songs about faith, and so on, and while I sense that these topics are dealt with in sort of a \\"christian\\" way, they are still portrayed universally enough for non-Christians to appreciate them. Casey's voice, heard most often on the album, is a nice parallel to the other voices in the group and compliments the music nicely.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy and Steve Morse are at the top of their game here-- though the latter can do no wrong, the former displays once again why progressive music is his home. Over the years, Mike Portnoy's best drumming has not been in Adrenaline Mob, A7X, or the heavier, post-Six Degrees DT albums he has played on. Rather, it has been in Transatlantic and Neal Morse. This album is no exception. Mike is at the top of this game here, and locks in with bassists David LaRue's grooving style perfectly. I think this is his best drumming in a long, long time. It is further proof that, where Portnoy is a just a minor-player in the metal world, he is a prophet in the dominion of prog rock. As for Steve Morse? His playing is astounding. Every note on the album sounds so \\"right\\", like he could not have played a better note, or done with more or less. He truly is a master of the craft.<br /><br />What makes Flying Colors so special is that it is not just Transatlantic + Dixie Dregs + Alpha Rev. It's something much different, and something new. \\"Kayla\\" makes us tear up, while \\"The Storm\\" liberates us, and the chorus to \\"Infinite Fire\\" will call to us when for weeks, even when we're not listening to it. It's an emotional and exciting album, and I sincerely hope that this project will be more than a one-off thing.tic range is much broader- there are love-songs, songs about hardship, songs about faith, and so on, and while I sense that these topics are dealt with in sort of a \\"christian\\" way, they are still portrayed universally enough for non-Christians to appreciate them.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game is awesome. I can't believe it took me this long to write a review. If you like space games, RPGs, roguelikes, or just fun game, Star Traders is for you!<br /><br />I've been playing it for months now, and it's the only mobile game that I consistently go back to. There's always something new to do. I won't write up everything that this game does, because that list is available in the description. What I will say is that it is extremely fun and addicting, and there are always new rewards to unlock by performing certain feats in game, leading to a staggering amount of replayability.<br /><br />Since I've owned the game, I can't begin to count the number of free updates which have added content to the game. The devs are really behind this game and the amount of support they have given it after release is amazing. If anything, you should buy it to support the amazing devs who are perfect examples of why indie games are awesome. They deserve way more than the small amount they are asking for this great game.

B00756GKBA|3.0|I've been a Madonna fan since 1984 and have followed her entire career, seen every tour since the Girlie Show..<br />In my opinion this is her weakest CD to date. Most of the CD are dance songs with lots of effects,electro-techno,  auto-tune which are upbeat, fun and great for dancing and working out, but are mostly forgettable, this seems to be the trend in music as Lady Gaga put out Born this Way which is full of forgettable dance Tracks..The best song on MDNA is \\"Masterpiece\\" This is the style of music Madonna does best and what she is best known for. Just a Great Pop music ballad with no special effects.<br /><br />I will review each song:<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild- Mediocre dance song, sounds like something Britney would do, nobody will remember it next year<br /><br />Gang Bang- Madonna does an industrial music song for the first time,, this is a great catchy track, though on some parts of the song, you can't tell its Madonna.<br /><br />I'm Addicted- Fun Dance track, nothing special<br /><br />Turn Up the Radio-- Highlight of the CD, Very 80s with a modern touch, great summer dance song, again nothing amazing and will be forgotten by next year<br /><br />Give Me all your Luvin-- Very 80s,, Micky by Toni Basil,, fun song..<br /><br />Some Girls-- Very 80's, some parts do not sound like Madonna , reminds me of 80s band Bow Wow Wow,, Good Song, nothing amazing.. for some reason i could picture simon le bon of duran duran singing this song..<br /><br />Superstar:-- At first i didnt like it, but now i do after some listens,, its a cute girly fun song.<br /><br />I dont Give a-- Reminds of of Michael Jackson's \\"they don't care about us\\"-- Ok song,, nothing amazing.<br /><br />I'm a Sinner-- One of the best songs on the CD, reminds me of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\",, great lyrics and beat<br /><br />Love Spent-- One of the best songs on the CD,, Catchy and very addicting, Love the Chorus, makes you sing along,,sticks in your head,, She should release this as the next single,,I just wish her voice was not drowned out by the effects here, i think it could have been better.<br /><br />Masterpiece- Best song on the whole cd, Classic Pop Madonna<br /><br />Falling Free-- Sounds like it could be on Ray of Light, beautiful ballad. i want more of this<br /><br />Beautiful Killer-- Catchy song, fun but a little boring<br /><br />I F--- Up-- Great song,,one of the best off the CD, Slow electro beat.<br /><br />BDAy song-- Worst Song on the CD--horrible<br /><br />Best friend-- Boring and dull, skip<br /><br />Give me all your luvin remix-- Disappointing remixe,,I just wish her voice was not drowned out by the effects here, i think it could have been better.<br /><br />Masterpiece- Best song on the whole cd, Classic Pop Madonna<br /><br />Falling Free-- Sounds like it could be on Ray of Light, beautiful ballad. i want more of this<br /><br />Beautiful Killer-- Catchy song, fun but a little boring<br /><br />I F--- Up-- Great song,,one of the best off the CD, Slow electro beat.<br /><br />BDAy song-- Worst Song on the CD--horrible<br /><br />Best friend-- Boring and dull, skip<br /><br />Give me all your luvin remix-- Disappointing remix

My Xbox now has a carrying case that just so happens to come with an LCD screen...it allows me to hook up or pack up with ease and go about my day....the screen is excellent (though a bit glossy...but i can live with it).  I got it to run at 1080 via the XBox settings...the sound is phenomenal...though I tend to use headphones.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I have to prop something under the screen to get it to tilt exaclty how i want it...but thats what they make magazines for.<br /><br />Love it and highly recommend it to anyone who is a gamer.
B003G4W49C|4.0|For the most part this book is entertaining.  Given its year of publication, I was surprised at how many of the things covered in this book remain relevant to this day.  One of the pleasantly surprising elements of the plot involves anonymous rhetoricians posting their thoughts on political philosophy and current events on the web, and watching their words reshape human society.  I got the feeling while reading this book that it could have been penned by someone writing within the last year or two.<br /><br />What I think is the overarching theme of the book is also something that remains relevant today.  Young children essentially coerced, through the circumstances of their births, into military service.  They are picked up from their homes, taken far away, and trained to fight a war that they are told is for the survival of the human race.  Once given the tools necessary to wage war, and wage it well, they realize that what that had been told was not necessarily the truth.  Essentially, the protagonist is tricked into doing things that he would not have chosen to do if he had known the entire story.  In the end, things turn towards a search for redemption.<br /><br />The parallels here should be obvious to anyone aware of the last ten years of American history, so I will not go into laborious detail.  I will simply say that I found those themes enjoyable, and extremely relevant to our times.<br /><br />In spite of that, I found parts of the book a bit cumbersome.  Too much time, I think, is devoted towards the battle school.  Once that is complete and Ender is ready to move into his real test, the finale and resolution of the story seem rushed, though somewhat satisfying.  I do not think the time in the battle school is unimportant, and do not look at this as a zero sum thing where elements of the story of Ender's training should be sacrificed in order to devote those pages to the climax and resolution, but I would liked to have seen more of those things towards the end.  (And I am dancing around here trying to avoid putting out any spoilers.)  Specifically, I do not like how Ender simply checks out and then has the events on Earth after his final battle related to him by another character.  I would like to have seen more of those events for myself, rather than have them summarized.  Based on a synopsis I have read of the second book, though, I think these things may be addressed there.<br /><br />Although I find this book entertaining, interesting, and worthy of a read, I have a hard time understanding why people proclaim it a classic.  Perhaps they read it when they were younger, as I did books like 1984, Brave New World, Animal Farm, etc. and remember it fondly as Ender's Game represents their first introduction to these themes.  It is a good book, I recommend it, and it is only going to grow in popularity as we approach its imminent movie adaptation (which is already being filmed).he end.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I previously have seen two other lengths of \\"Das Boot\\": the first, being two and a half hours long and the second being 3 hrs. 30 minutes long.  I found the two and a half hour version inferior when compared to the 3 and a half hour version because the shorter version was more choppy, containing just the highlights of the action-packed moments in the movie.  The 3 and a half hour version explored in greater detail the relationships of the members of the submarine crew, their quarrels and their comaraderie, the first weeks of the submarine's uneventful search for British convoys and destroyers, and the ingenuity needed to both run the submarine and make the necessary repairs on it in the aftermath of being attacked by enemy (British) destroyers.  The five hour version stresses to an even greater extent these aspects of the film already evident in the three and a half hour version and portrays in an interesting manner the tedium of waiting to encounter the enemy vessels in the middle of the Atlantic.  However, the technical maneuvering of the ship and the repairs necessary to be done and the chit-chat amongs the crewmembers and officers are recorded in even greater detail.  Also in the five hour version, the viewer has the weird sense that he has become a member of the crew living day in and day out the 70 day journey of this German submarine's journey through the Atlantic, the straits of Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean Sea.  One has a greater understanding of how the German sailors personal hygiene and health is compromised by being cooped up in a submarine.  The five hour version has the disadvantage of being less likely to be viewed in one sitting.  One feels compelled to watch the remaining third on the following day.  In the three and a half hour version one finds the drama more intensified into one single totally absorbing sitting.<br /><br />The movie \\"Das Boot\\"'s merits consist in seeing the officers and crewmembers not as ardent Nazis, but as German mendoing their naval duties and thereby serving their country. Indeed, the stoic captain and his lieutenants in the movie speak disdainfully of Hitler's bombastic speeches and the fanatical nature of the Nazi movement. The crew comes across as human beings helplessly caught up in a conflict that they did not create.  At one point they even show their admiration of their enemy (the British navy and convoy) when they sing \\"It's a long way to Tipperary.\\" The German crew even feels remorse when it can not rescue the few remaining British sailors who jump off from their oil tanker in flames that has been torpedoed by the German submarine.  This movie is an excellent expression of what life would be like aboard a German submarine during World War II.  And one can feel great sympathy for the doomed German sailors who struggle to survive against a British foe who is becoming less vulnerable both in the air and on the water because of their increasing sophisticated use of radar and sophisticated maneuvering tactics that make attacks by the German U-Boat wolf-packs increasingly less successful and more treacherous.  The plight of this German crew seems to mirror the turning of the tide of World War II against the Germans.
0812548094|3.0|This book was good, but not as good as the first in the series. However this review is not about the content of the book.  I got the Kindle version and it was riddled with typos.  It's very distracting to read a book that has so many mistakes in it.  I'm sure the author would not be pleased with the way his creation is being distributed.
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|Very fun.  Great storyline, great gags.  Everything about the film was polished, and way above the expectations you might have for a spin off of a sequel.  The only concern I had was the strange message of sacrifice that was pretty contrived towards the end.  This might turn off parents of young children, especially if you don't want to begin this sort of complicated discussion.  Maybe save that for Les Misribles when they're old enough for French musicals.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|What a treat it was to watch this well acted, well directed movie.  Di Caprio at his best! Finally I undrestand the real reason for all the rumours about J Edgar.  Well worth a look.
0425238091|5.0|I read this when it was first published in 1978 and still, thirty-four years later remember scenes from the book.  That's how great it is.  To this day I can't enter a hospital without thinking \\"Gomer\\"!  I read it while I was in Law School and it was nice to feel some shared pain with other students in a different profession, doing their best but still getting it wrong.  The book was well-written, light, fun but with a deeper thread on just how hard our budding Medical professionals work to get where they end up.<br /><br />I have a son now in Medical School, so of course I had to buy a copy from Amazon for him last year.  He enjoyed it too, along with \\"THE ANATOMY OF DECEPTION\\" by Lawrence Goldstone, a Medical Mystery.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love it!! it is a great app! it is so fun! it is also a great pass time! my kids and i both enjoy this game fer.much! getbthis app!!!!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I bought this app as soon as it was out and I have to outline the fact that is great, fresh, exciting, the new revamped interface surely gives a new touch to Angry birds, by the way, playing the original angry birds wont be of the same help it used to be before, because it is a new gameplay, the physics are very different, but they manage to feel natural and logical, surely a must have for the angry birds lovers, and for the non-lovers, this for being so different probably is your introduccion to the angry birds world!!!
B001GQSY64|5.0|This movie is a great movie for kids.  My son is 6 years old and he loves this movie.
0439023521|5.0|Incredible how a fictional book can relate so much to our current realities.<br />Wars, death of children, reality tv, deterioration of our ecosystem...it brings all this subjects together in a wonderfull story that you just can't get enough of.<br />All three books are just amazing!
B0035G9ABQ|1.0|Because the album I'm listening to is AWFUL.  I've tried to listen to it twice and honestly I can't get all the way through a single song, they're all just TERRIBLE.  Even the ones that start out promising end up becoming tiresome garbage half way through.  What happened to Gorillaz?<br /><br />The addition of a veritable raft full of has-beens and never-weres doesn't help either.  Really, Snoop Dogg trotting out his tired, dried up style again?  Lou Reed trying to be relevant to anyone under 40?  And who are the rest of these people turning in 8 am drive-time quality \\"rap\\" that just ruins what might have been a decent song here and there?<br /><br />Honestly this album is junk.  I regret wasting $10 on it, I could have used the money to start a camp fire and it would have been less wasteful.  The Fall was way better, and it was recorded in hotel rooms during a tour.  How Gorillaz turned out this waste-bin filler is beyond me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun to play if u r board. But some games r hard for me. i am mostly rating this for the extra points.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really enjoy taking notes on this program. there are not a whole lot of things you can do with editing, but I would not use that on such a small device anyway.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Basic but refined, easy play, and simple but satisfying animation. This game keeps me entertained between breaks, lunch, and even as a wind-down after work.
B005ZUR724|5.0|super good game! excellent graphics, simple controls, smooth gameplay.<br />the quests aren't impossible like some games. this game is absolutely amazing!<br />the only issue is that it sometimes has connection problems but that is easily fixed.<br />absolutely the freakin best rpg on my kindle!!!<br />awesome!!!!!!!!!!
0634060384|5.0|This is a great book, a must have if you're going to the jazz jams.  The charts are updated - and far more correct than the earlier versions you used to buy out of someone's trunk at night in a parking lot.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I  hav learned to read reviews closely and, in this instance, to know Chris McVie was not participating, turned me off. She became an integral part of Mac and I enjoy albums more when she was aboard.<br />Cheers<br />Boris
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app but wish you could download the NIV version.  Also, it woulld be greay if a study Bible was available.
0767802519|5.0|The Professional is simply professionally done. I love the layout of the story line and the actors. Gary Oldman makes a fantastic performance as usual. I love all of the psychotic syndictive dark characters he plays as in this one. That's what makes a movie live. If you've never seen this move than buy it. The ending is the saddest part of the movie, it's well worth it. I love the song. Sting-Shape Of My Heart.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie at our Church dinner and movie night event and moved by it.  It has many messages in for women, men and children, so I bought it and had it sent to my Daughter for her family to see.  She said the same that it was very moving with much meaning.  I would recommend it for eveyone to see.
B001TODCII|5.0|I am in love with this movie! <3 It is one of my favorites. Liam Neeson does a fantastic performance. A man who doesn't stop until he gets what he came for. I just can't wait for the second part to come out this year! =D
B007N5YIUS|1.0|downloaded it, completely installed, clicked on app, goes right back to the home screen. maybe just doesn't  work for coby kyros..?
B0049P1VHS|5.0|What can I say? This is a great show on television. I love it and if you love zombies, gore, shooting, running for your life, adrenaling pumping heart stopping action.....than you'll love it too!!! =D
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a little choppy though so if you don't<br />like stories told that way, I don't recommend it.
0545265355|5.0|Book 1 is a must read prior to viewing the new Hunger Games movie.  Promise - you won't want to put the book down!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it took me a while to finally find a game like this I got to say its much better on my kindle fire then an aneroid phone
1848313470|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with the depth of the book. Many, often amazing examples of epigenetics overwhelm the book to the point where I was saturated and looking desperately for the science behind it all. I consider it a 'dumbed' down book that leaves me grasping for more and not finding it. If you like the science end of it keep looking.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Although predictable at times (I saw what was happening with Fr. O'Leary and the vacation) I liked this book.  I liked that I couldn't understand the protective nature of Andy.  It left me wanting to figure out why he was blind to what seemed obvious.  Even Laurie, who you would expect to have a biased, more 'mother-blind' view was acutely aware of her son's lack of empathy.  I appreciated the author's use of social media as a vital part of the story and how it played into the way of obtaining evidence. This story tells more than just Jacob's tale.  It tells bias from a parenting point of view, bullying which is more than rampant in our schools today, entitlement that is seen more and more from the youth of today and the protective nature of family members that take it too far.  If you work with children at all you are very aware of all of these issues.  If you are looking for a quick read, this is a good book for you.  It took me awhile to get into it, but about 1/4 of the way in I read through it at a fast pace.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app was so fun. every game was engineered perfectly. they were hard, but not too hard. I really enjoyed it!
B006X08FDA|5.0|The title track is worth the price of admission alone.  It is one of the most profound, deep, and beautiful American songs--ever.<br /><br />And the rest of the album is exceptional.  If you love traditional American music, bluegrass, or just want to find out what the buzz is about, get this album.  It has a depth that few musicans are able to achieve.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|we win and you are angry birds but we help to get our eggs back.okey lets get started can you help me?
0316066524|5.0|Like James Joyce's Ulysses, the sheer accretion of detail in this book eventually creates characters that seem to be living breathing human beings. What I most appreciated about this book is that it opened up my eyes to the struggles of addicts of all kinds. This is not an easy book - I am a fast, voracious reader, and it took me several months... had to read it in short bursts with a notebook in hand just to keep track of what was going on - and I'm still not sure, in many parts, what DID happen...but there are images seared into my head from this book that I will never forget (some of them I wish I could). Most of all, I appreciate this work for giving me compassion and insights into the struggles of the kind of people whom I had previously written off. This is a book I plan on rereading every few years. My advice: 1) don't skip the footnotes (2) give it until page 150 before giving up (3) realize if one storyline is boring you, another one is just around the corner. Good luck!
030788743X|5.0|Ernest Cline has composed a shining gem of a book in \\"Ready Player One\\". It tells the story of a young man who has joined thousands of people around the world to compete in a massive multiplayer immersive game called OASIS whose chief architect, James Halliday, had recently died. In his will, Halliday explained that his entire personal fortune-- measured in the hundreds of billions --would be given to the player could find an easter egg hidden deep within the layers of his virtual world. To solve the puzzle, one would need to be deeply familiar with Halliday's favorite era of American pop culture: the 1980s. As a result, the entire world finds itself in a 1980s renaissance during the middle of the 21st century-- memorizing Pink Floyd lyrics and watching old episodes of 'Family Ties' in the hopes that doing so might help them find one of the clues to solve Halliday's puzzle.<br /><br />Cline has penned the most original work of fiction I've encountered since Mason's \\"The Lost Books of Odysseus\\", and I look forward to diving into his future stories.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not commonly a fantasy reader or YA reader but with all the excitement surrounding the book, I had to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did. It was an interesting idea about how the future of North America plays out and an all-important annual government-sanctioned \\"Survivor\\"-type game mixed with Gladiator fight-to-the-death games. The story draws you in quickly, keeps the pages turning, and does leave you wondering what comes next; a quick, hard-to-put-down read. I can see this becoming assigned reading in middle and high schools, like Lord of the Flies.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|Not having known what I was getting myself into when I started Altered Carbon I thought I may have picked up a mid-series book.  The action starts up abruptly but clearly walks you through what's going on once the fire dies down.<br />The book walks you through the worlds with assumed knowledge filled in casually which keeps the stream of consciousness flowing in a clean manner.  The story is gritty and launches into visceral violence as easily as it informs the readers of the new concept of \\"organic damage\\".<br />Satisfying read which alludes nicely technological innovation outpacing normal moral quandaries.
B007KQXB2G|1.0|Wow, I can't believe they bothered putting this together. It's just a power point lesson in How to be a sales man with some pics from the show.  Stuff like \\"Take Risks\\", \\"Act Self Confidant\\" \\"Dress Well\\". Not even remotely interesting. Price 0.0? Hardly, I wasted precious time watching ten minutes of this bland filler.
B00756GKBA|3.0|This album is too much of a derivative of Paper Airplanes' style from M.I.A's Kala album. With the exception of the William Orbit produced songs which sometimes can sound a bit too much like Ray of Light,  most of the songs are a continuation of the same theme which in this case it set by  Give Me All Your Luvin'. There's the typical religious overtone which is sort of boring. Lady Gaga and Madonna should make a promise not to talk about Jesus anymore unless they're willing to delve deep into it. The shallow religious introspection which is normally hinted at but never fully discussed was cool when Madonna did it in the eighties but here we are 23 years later and unlike a Happy Meal the message is no longer fresh.  On the positive side, there are some stand outs, honesty, and message that I think relates to Madonna's past marriage, which I think works though not always musically. If you're a Madonna fan you will enjoy this album even if you know you will have to (and I know you will) listen to it several times before you really appreciate it.<br /><br />B-Day Song: Thanks to one of your comments I realized this isn't William Orbit but if you know his style you can't get closer than this. This song would work great in a soundtrack for a film like Filth and Wisdom which isn't a bad thing as much as that's the only environment where this song might work. There might also be couple of little girls out there that might love this song simply because it's a birthday song. Is this a marketing strategy at work : )?<br />* *<br /><br />Beautiful Killer:  \\"Don't Speak, I know what you're just saying\\".  Kidding...not sure how I feel about this song. Is it a new version of Beautiful Stranger? Not sure about the lyrics which if you're a Madonna fan, are too familiar.<br />**<br /><br />Best Friend:  Slightly reminds me of Devil Wouldn't Recognize You. I think it has the potential to grow on you. I do like the honesty in this song.  Now the string of young guys Madonna has been dating make sense. Nothing helps to try and feel better or to try and get back to someone that you've loved than dating someone younger and hotter. That's the case even when the circumstances in a break up haven't been the worse.  Madonna might still be in love with her ex and is going through the process just like us normal humans.<br />****<br /><br />Falling Free: Love the lyrics here, might give this a couple of more listens thought, it definitely might be more of a true fan's song.<br />**<br /><br />Gang Bang: Pretty Cool, Can't wait to blast this song in my car. Love what Madonna does with her voice here. The sound effects throughout the song work great. This also slightly reminds me of Britney's Big Fat Bass.<br />****<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild: This is Madonna at her best which is simply making great dance music.<br />*****<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin: Not the best Madonna single though as a marketing strategy it works well. Don't feel like talking about this single anymore. All I need to say is Paper Airplanes.<br />**<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin' (Party Rock Remix): Blah, just not a fan of this song no matter how many singers get thrown at it.<br />*<br /><br />I'm a Sinner: William Orbit at work again. I don't mind this song but it might again be more for a true blue Madonna fan.  Definitely over the Jesus, Mary thing and please no more talk of saints, or praying unless you're at home getting ready to go to bed.<br />**<br /><br />I'm addicted: Pretty good song, makes me thing of MDNA which is quite appropriate though it's obvious and superficial in its attempt to be controversial with the constant repetition of the words \\"Addicted\\" and \\"MDNA\\". It's sort of strange considering that we've been told that the naming of the album was a coincidence and had nothing to do with the other more popular use of the acronym MDNA.<br />****<br /><br />I Don't Give A: Too derivative of the Paper Airplanes style. Please stop with the Jesus thing. I'm not a believer but that statement is a little too overdone by everyone and it's not shocking as much as boring.<br />*<br /><br />I F****d Up: The one thing I like about this song is that this is what happens when you're having an inner struggle that makes your heart rationalize why you shouldn't have ended a relationship but your brain  tells you you've done the right thing. Pretty honest, the message is cool, not sure about the actual arrangement of the song though.<br />***<br /><br />Love Spent: Madonna might not have been trying to do this but in the beginning this sort of sounds like Telephone by Lady Gaga. There's also a tinge of \\"Hung Up\\". I do really enjoy the Banjo playing and that's pretty new in a Madonna album. Overall<br />I like this song.<br />****<br /><br />Love Spent (Acoustic Version): Can someone tell me what language she's singing in here? I like this song.*****<br /><br />Masterpiece: It's alright, though it's pretty disconnected from the rest of the album.  Also reminds me of a much more polished version of Time Stood Still.<br />***<br /><br />Some girls: Some more of Paper Planes, Give Me All Your Luvin' (though more processed), Janet Jackson's throb, and the soundtrack for some video game. It initially starts well but falls apart fairly quickly.<br />*<br /><br />Superstar: Sounds like a song that Madonna could have done really early on in her career if she had started singing in 2005 and lived in the UK and was named M.I.A. Also sounds a bit too much like Give Me All Your Luvin', it's almost the same idea with different vocals.<br />*<br /><br />Turn Up the Radio: Paper Airplanes please, yes I'll take 12 of those.<br />*

B0076NKNLA|4.0|Otherwise, I don't know how much I can say about this film...  I went to see it with a couple friends, without any prior knowledge of or interest in Marilyn Monroe's films or life, and didn't feel that I came away with much more of either. What I did find it to provide, quite powerfully, was a picture of the darker side of 1950s America.  A moment I found especially memorable is a scene in which a doctor calls a pregnancy a \\"private matter\\", very much as if it were something shameful.  Which, in that time of transition from Victorian prudery to equally superficial and judgmental body-envy, it may well have been.
B004USRKX8|5.0|Much has been said of the many solo projects by members of CS&N(Y).  They are, mostly, hit or miss affairs.  For me, they are, unfortunately, mostly the latter.  CS&N(Y) is/was a group with a hell of a lot of talent, but too much in the way of baggage, past rivalries, ego clashes, and varying musical agendas.  When they gelled, they gelled, and produced wonderful music such as their first two albums, a few singles, the live Four-Way Street, and an occasional solo record.<br /><br />Besides Stills' first solo outing, entitled Stephen Stills, Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name is one of the better splinter projects from the group.<br /><br />It's well documented that Crosby was in an emotional hell during the writing and recording of this record--he suffered the loss of his girlfriend--yet he delivers a mature and focused record that is highly original and teeming with fruitful collaborations and interesting soundscapes.  Joni Mitchell appears.  As does Neil Young.  And Jerry Garcia.  And a host of others.  But it's the songs that are truly magnificent.  \\"Laughing\\" is gorgeous, plain and simple.  As is \\"Orleans\\" and \\"Music is Love.\\"  \\"Cowboy Movie\\" has some wonderful electric guitar (by, I believe, Jerry himself!) and \\"Song With No Words\\" is a lovely and deep foray into Crosby's world of alternate guitar tunings.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best free apps I have found.  Can not go wrong with this one if you like to play solitaire.
B005N95JA4|5.0|Some Girls is not a record I typically listen to a lot.  Though it does have a handful of solid tunes such as \\"Faraway Eyes,\\" \\"Miss You,\\" and \\"Beast of Burden,\\" the record, which is impressively eclectic in style and mood, has to contend with Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, Let It Bleed, and Beggar's Banquet.<br /><br />With the second disc of bonus tracks, though, it's an entirely different album.  It now has more blues and more rock and more country.  There's more pedal steel and more acoustic guitar and more timeless songs that really constitute the long lost Stones record.  Highly recommended.
0451169514|4.0|Stephen King has the ability to scare you while you read he tells a story about these kids they live in Derry. The town is very peaceful but kind of eerie and not normal because of the Death of kids that happen every year. One that is really sad is George and the boat the clown in the sewer I  think the book has a more gruesome scene then it is in the movie. Most of the story is not really base on the Clown Penny wise but mostly what happens in the town cause nobodies normal. Beverly Marsh I thinks is the bravest of the group because she came from an abusive father and then later had a abusive boyfriend that finally push her to the limit to stand for herself. Ben Hanscom has a interesting Childhood because he got picked on from being fat kid and got teased and tortured by Henry Bowers, and Belch. Mike Halon is the pretty much the leader figure of the story that keeps everyone together made the form a promise that if the It would come back that they would come back to stop it. Eddie Kasprak is a character I that I can relate because he has mother that tries to shelter him and baby him from the outside because he as as ma attacks,pretty much a mommas boy. He later find a girlfriend that is pretty much like his mom and he has to choose to go back to Derry or stay with a mother like friend. The message I think Stephen King was trying to bring across is friendship is the key to making one lives happy and trying new places like leaving you home town to get out into the real world. The book overall was different from a like what you read from a Harry Potter type book. Stephen likes to go in debt in characters of how the person really is with language,innuendos,and adult situations. I liked the book because of the movie inspired me to read it. I have to say I like the book better then the movie. If they ever to remake this this would probably be rated R.

Dennis LeHane may be an outstandingly talented author, but he is most certainly not my bag, so to speak. However, personal preference does not detract from the quality of the writing and/or novel. 5 stars.

B005LAIGQ4|1.0|This is a typical Hollywood election year propaganda movie.  The socialist / communists want to destroy our economy.  One of the vehicles they have admitted to be using is the  \\"Green\\" environmental agenda.  By choking off the oil and pushing other economy destroying agendas they are bringing our country to its knees. This movie glorifies the communists that are responsible for the $5.00 a gallon gas we pay. It horribly and disgustingly belittles and falsely portrays the people who actually spent money and were responsible for helping to free the whales, Ronald Reagan, the oil company and the local Eskimos.  I was disgusted that I spent my money going to see this movie only to find out that I had been duped into paying Hollywood to put out another communist propaganda movie.  Last year I voluntarily spent 1,800.00 on gasoline with about 50% of that being taxes. That got me to work everyday and I it took me on vacation.  I forcibly had taken from me about $18,000.00 in taxes. What did that get me?  It was blown away by one of the Obama's million dollar vacations.  Or it was spent paying off the Hollywood hypocrites with government-funded grants to make trash like this move.  Isn't it amazing how the gas company is portrayed the big evil greedy selfish organization, when the real big selfish organization is the oversized over important socialist government. Don't waste your money on  this Hollywood propaganda junk.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|If you have read the book you will be pleased with how well the movie is reproduced. Daniel Craig is surprisingly excellent and perfect for the role of Blomkvist.  The girl (Salander) is a little bit too good looking for the role but she carries it off.<br /><br />It is interesting if you are a James Bond fan that Frode is played by an actor who was once a villain in a Bond movie.  He also carries off his part very well.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next \\"Girl with the\\" movie.

And harry potter. i love the books and i just recently saw te first movie. they are both very good and i highly recommend reading the books and seeing the movies. i love katniss everdeen and i think that if you read about her too you would love her and the books immediately!<br /><br />i am so glad that Suzanne Collins wrote this series and i am glad that the have made the movie pretty close to the book. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />BUT please remember this; this is the biggest fan of the hunger games telling you this so you may not like it. but i do and if dont please do not take<br />out any of your out on me.<br />thank you for reading my review. :)
B003D8KH9A|5.0|Well I purchased this to cover a pool this item is for. But due to issues with the pool we decided to use this else where, rather then returning the item. Now it is a dog pen cover and works far better then a regular trap anyone can buy from Wal-Mart. Recommended for anything you want to cover to protect from the rain and or weather.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its kinda fun just remember to read the instructions. lots of ads. but the games are a little simple. good for a little mindless fun.
B004SGWYW4|3.0|I didn't watch it all. I have seen only 3 episodes. I couldn't get passed the fact of how bad this show is.<br /><br /> I'm your average male. Aged 19. I am what many people would call a hipster (i prefer less popular items and shows/music then most people) so take that for what it is in this review.<br /><br /> I've liked anime for many years. I have also liked zombies for many years. When i heard they were making a zombie anime i was ecstatic. I watched the first episode the day it aired. I continued on for the following 2 weeks. After that i just couldn't continue.<br /><br /> Let me get this out of the way. I'm a liberal. I strongly believe in human rights. One of my main beliefs is equality between races, genders, and social groups. This show frankly shows everything wrong with the current anime industry. Anime has lost it's art form and meaning. It's lost plot and character development. It's turned into a fan service mess. Why did this happen? the fans of anime have demanded moe characteristics and fan service for many years. Looking at animes over 10 years old these rarely existed. there may have been nudity but it wasn't sexual in any nature. Sure some did but they were the minority. being a humanist i strongly believe people should be treated equally. In our current society women are still deemed as sex objects. This show turns them into such sex objects. it even shows behavior unlikely to ever occur in real life. This show isn't just gory (i like gore) and full of panty shots and boob shots it is also offensive and degrading to women anywhere. When will our society learn.<br /><br /> In conclusion this show is practically everything wrong with the current anime industry and is one of the prime reasons i will never wear anime as a badge of pride in public. I don't want to be thought of as some kind of pervert.<br /><br /> Have a nice day.
B006PZBRCY|2.0|I have not seen such a forced, predictable, and poorly directed film in a long time. Total Hollywood schlopp. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of just one was the animatronics.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|It's a great show, but not for kids or the faint of heart.  I cannot recommend it enough to any fantasy fans, or any fans of good fiction.  The show works on every level: writing, directing, cast, music, and production values.
B005Y423ZC|3.0|True, her voice is good..but cutting to all the roll-focus shots one after another after another made me want to scream at the director!

B005HS00P0|5.0|This review is almost entirely for the quality of the vinyl pressing.  I heard the song \\"Midnight City\\" on the radio, really liked it, and picked up this record at my local shop as a result.<br /><br />This vinyl is probably the best I've purchased yet.  It sounds incredibly clear and the sound range is impressive. The vinyl is pristine looking and audiophile thickiness.  Also, the edges are more square than usual (they don't thin/round out towards the end).  Easily one of the best albums I own on vinyl in terms of sound quality. The price wasn't exactly cheap, though there are 20+ songs on the album, so overall a very good price per song.<br /><br />This would be a great album to benchmark your audio system (or system changes) on.<br /><br />For comparison, my audio system consists of:<br /><br />Pioneer VSX-521 receiver (5.0 configuration)<br />Audio Technica AT-LP120 turntable w/ AT95HE cartridge<br />(5x) paradigm atom v.6 speakers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My friends all were begging me to read this book. When I finally did I discovered why they all wanted me to read it, IT'S AMAZING! It has just enough action, drama and complexity. Katniss and Peeta are the absolute best... but I think I shouldn't say much more about them... read it for yourself, you'll be glad you did. And it's cheap too!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A good read. It's like he tapped into my brain to channel my cultural icons that defined my growing up as a nerd. I was very entertained and read it in one day because it's just that good. check it out and I think you will like if have any connection to the 1980's.

1594744769|4.0|I have to admit I read this book more out of curiosity than excitement based on the description, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not sure how I would classify this book.  It's part fantasy (time travel, \\"extraordinary powers\\"), part love story and part teenager coming-of-age.  The author has a very unique way of making us care about the main character in the book.  He's a rich kid who wants for nothing and has a certain bitterness about life.  The one bright spot in his life as a child was listening to his grandfather's stories.  These stories were presented to him as truth, but as he grew, he began to lose his innocent faith in his grandfather.  He outgrows the magic of these stories, much like we all grow to realize that Santa Claus and his magical elves aren't real.  But what if, in following your heart and the last words of your dying grandfather, you discovered that the magical stories were real?<br />I felt such empathy for a grandfather who lived a double life in solitude, with nobody who believed in him.  I felt sorry for Jacob, who understood his grandfather too late to let him know.  As Jacob faces the crisis of believing in what he is seeing even though what he's seeing makes no rational sense, I felt he really grew up.  Suspense, love, fantasy elements (levitating children!) and family drama all play out in this well written and entertaining novel.  There is a cliffhanger of sorts at the end, so I do hope a sequel is coming.
1400034205|5.0|W.Somerset Maughham's 1944 novel \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a challenging but engrossing novel, still in print.  Maugham is his own narrator in a tale that follows the lives of a handful of characters in the years between the two World Wars.  In Maugham's own words, it is the story of their separate paths to success, but that success is defined quite differently for each...<br /><br />At the center of the story is Larry Durrell, a young American aviator who comes out of the First World War with PTSD and a driving need to find inner peace.  Larry's quest will take him on an extended journey through Europe and ultimately to India.  Along the way, he will be engaged to two very different women.  Isabel has a desperate love for Larry, but an equal need for a wealthy lifestyle and social prominence; Sophie is a deep but wounded soul whom Larry will try to rescue.  Gray is the decent and conventional guy who competes for the beautiful Isabel; Elliot is Isabel's snobbish but doting uncle, a fixture of the Paris social scene.<br /><br />Maugham's narrator interacts with the principal characters at long intervals; the changes in their lives become apparent with each meeting.  The narrative is laced with much acute social commentary and some fascinating vignettes, especially of inter-war Paris.  The characters are living, breathing creations, attractive to the reader in spite of their very human faults.  The punch line of the novel is saved for the concluding pages; the ending is unconventional and may be unsatisfying for some readers.  \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is very highly recommended as one of Maugham's best novels, with a theme still relevant to today's readers.

B006BQI1V2|4.0|A fictionalized, but emotionally powerful drama about a young Jewish girl, Sarah, who was one of 13,000 Jewish emigrants and refugees rounded up by the French police in German-occupied Paris and shipped to Auschwitz. A present day American journalist Julia, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, attempts to unravel events of the past. The film alternates between the past and the present, relating both the ordeal of 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski and that of the present day journalist attempting to find out what happened to Sarah, who Julia knows was not killed at Auschwitz. Intertwined with Sarah's story is a portrait of middle-aged Julia's struggle with her desire to carry to term a \\"surprise\\" pregnancy that her husband does not want. Several reviewers felt that \\"the angst of modern life over-shadows past tragedy\\". Granted that Sarah's story (the first two thirds of the movie) is stronger than Julia's (the last third), but I feel that the intertwining of the stories lends strength to the movie. The first part of the film, which focuses on the young Sarah, is unbelievable good (I give it a 5). The second part is about a 3.5.<br /><br />This is not just another holocaust movie, of which there have been so many that they are beginning to lose their impact, but a film focused on the tribulations of two strong-willed, courageous women, a rarity in modern action films. The performances by Kristin Scott Thomas and especially Melusine Mayance (as the young Sarah) will keep you on the edge of your seat. Kristin Scott Thomas received a César Award nomination for her compelling performance in this role. I think the performance by Mayance as Sarah is the best I have seen by a young actor. This was her first film.

0143038419|4.0|This book is about one woman's journey to find God and a peaceful place in this world and the universe on the whole.<br /><br />I was expecting this book to be filled with wonderful tales of travels in Italy, India, and Indonesia (Bali). It didn't disappoint. Although the book did discuss her physical and spiritual journeys, there was so much to these tales that I found myself laughing, crying and really empathizing with the authour and those lives she touched and relationships she made.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book I was frustrated early on in the book with how detached she was from reality and immature early on. So consumed with her own issues and blaming others for things falling apart, and not owning up to her parts she played in her marriage and relationship with her on again off again boyfriend David. She also didn't seem to see how lucky she was to be a published authour, to have cash advances on books she had not even written yet that enabled her to travel for a year and find herself. Not to mention her first completely paid for journey to Bali for a written piece on yoga retreats. So it was frustrating to see someone with these amazing opportunities that were not being appreciated and recognized appropriately. That sense of childish expectation and lack of maturity does improve as the book goes through, but it takes a while and that was a bit frustrating to have to endure as a reader who struggles with just handling day to day expenses and medical issues to see such gifts not being extremely appreciated and being humbled by the amazing opportunities that come with good health, friends, an amazing job that you love, etc...<br /><br />I enjoyed Liz's writing style and the humour she puts into her writing. I will be reading her follow up novel,<br />\\"Committed\\". I found it hard to put the novel down, which is always a sign of a good book. I can tell this is one of those few books where I will re-read it many times. I didn't enjoy much of the Bali part of the trip early on. It wasn't until into got into Bali and she met a medicine woman friend that I started to like that part. I expected there to be more to it because Indian and Italy were such large chunks and so gripping.<br /><br />One other really annoying thing not with the writing but with the publishing company, the paper quality of the book itself was very poor. It's thin and the grease from your skin marks the pages, which really annoyed me as I keep my books in pristine condition. So if you can get this book used it's worth it as it's too much to pay for a book whose pages will mark so easy. That's a publishing issue and I plan to send a letter to them about that issue I had with the quality of paper they used.<br /><br />I rate this book 4/5 and plan to tell many strangers, friends and family members about taking some time to read this book. There's so much to be learned about yourself in the stories Liz describes. So take some notes and try some things and do a bit of research on your own and give yoga a try, meditation and mindfulness, etc... today!f the trip early on.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|The 2-disc \\"Un-Anniversary\\" DVD is a wonderful set that complements the wonderful film with a treasure trove of interesting bonus content for the Disney enthusiasts and film historians among us.  It's a thoroughly satisfying DVD, though I can't offer a comparison to other versions that have been released.<br /><br />THE MOVIE:<br /><br />I loved watching the Disney animated films on VHS when I was a kid, but as I got older I tended to favor the more recent Disney hits (\\"Aladdin\\", \\"The Lion King\\", etc.) over the original classics.  I hadn't enjoyed \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as much as, say, \\"Peter Pan\\" or even \\"101 Dalmatians\\", so the tape gathered dust over the years and my recollection of the movie got buried in my mind.  It had been so long since I'd seen \\"Alice\\" that when I watched this DVD I found there were scenes and songs that I'd forgotten all about, so it was like viewing the film with a fresh perspective.<br /><br />And I must say that this movie is great.  It's delightfully surreal and whimsical, and it's filled with fun characters and memorable scenes.  The animation by Disney's team is, unsurprisingly, fantastic and the art, styled after Mary Blair's graphic sensibilities, is beautiful.  The movie may not pack the wallop of some of Disney's higher-rated masterpieces, but it's a wonderful animated adventure.<br /><br />THE BONUS FEATURES:<br /><br />Although this DVD doesn't contain a full-length audio commentary, the \\"Reflections On Alice\\" featurette is a satisfying retrospective on Lewis Carroll's stories, Walt Disney's efforts to bring them to the screen, and the impact of the 1951 film.<br /><br />\\"Operation Wonderland\\" is a fascinating vintage promotional featurette that takes a behind-the-scenes look at the making of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" at the Disney animation studio.  Walt Disney leads narrator James Melton through the studio, showing how animation cels are photographed, how sequences are storyboarded, and how animators reference live-action performances.  There's some priceless footage of vaudeville comedian Ed Wynn (the voice of the Mad Hatter), Kathryn Beaumont (Alice), and Jerry Colonna (the March Hare) acting out the tea party scene on a soundstage while the animators sketch away.  (Improvised dialogue from these sessions was incorporated into the final film.)<br /><br />A more awkward curiosity is the half-hour excerpt from an episode of The Fred Waring Show, which promotes the music of the Disney film, featuring Kathryn Beaumont and Sterling Holloway (the Cheshire Cat) along with a chorus dressed in disturbingly crude costumes.<br /><br />The DVD also contains several demo recordings of songs that did not make it into the final film, as well as an early storyboard sequence of the scene from the book with the Duchess and her baby (which didn't make it into the film either).  The extensive art gallery features concept art from some different artists, including a showcase of Mary Blair's beautifully stylized work, along with some behind-the-scenes photos of Walt Disney and his animators.<br /><br />We even get two of Walt's television introductions to the film (a black & white one from 1954 and a very similar color one from 1964) and two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Disc One contains the classic (and totally relevant) Mickey Mouse cartoon \\"Thru the Mirror\\", and Disc Two contains the early 1920s live-action/animation hybrid short \\"Alice's Wonderland\\".<br /><br />\\"One Hour in Wonderland\\" is a family-friendly holiday television special from 1950 featuring Walt Disney, Kathryn Beaumont, Edgar Bergen (with his pals Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, of course), and Bobby Driscoll.  It shows clips from Mickey Mouse cartoons and Disney films like \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\", \\"Song of the South\\" (Uncle Remus!), and, you guessed it, the soon-to-be-released \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".  (The black & white program has been reconstructed for DVD to include movie clips in full color.)  There's also a neat appearance by the Firehouse Five Plus Two, the dixieland band made of Disney animators.<br /><br />For the younger crowd, Disc One contains interactive games and activities (\\"Virtual Wonderland Party\\" and \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\") which can be played using the remote control.  So there's enough extras to satisfy just about anyone.<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a unique fantasy from the glory days of Walt Disney animation.  It's enchanting to kids and adults alike, and really is a work of art.  The 2010 \\"Un-Anniversary Edition\\" DVD is a delightful package for anyone who loves the film and a welcome addition to any collection.  Definitely worth buying if you're interested, although this version may be outdated by more recent re-releases.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These are comfortable to use.  I think the thin foam pad that goes over the ear gel really helps that.  I already find the Voyager Pro to be a comfortable bluetooth earpiece.  It has more over the ear support than just relying on the in ear gel to keep it in place I find can be annoying and in many cases less secure.<br /><br />One thing I might mention is the manufacturer sent me this exact pack for FREE when I emailed them telling them I had lost one.  They said they would do this one time. Plantronics customer service was good. So you might consider asking them to get a free replacement, it worked for me.<br />So I ended up ordering more than I needed.  Though I will likely go through them eventually. Not a big deal for spending 5 bucks though.<br /><br />The also come in a couple different sizes if you find they are not fitting you perfectly and would like a size smaller or larger.  The Medium seems to the the ones that come stock with the bluetooth.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Do not be deterred by the title of this review. While AMC has shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men, I believe a show like the Walking dead only comes around once in a lifetime. This show since day 1 has become a cult phenomenon. When i first saw Days Gone Bye it was on the season 1 dvd which i bougtout of curiosity. Previously i was not a fan of the zombie genre, But walking dead has made me a believer. This can be attrbuted to the actual storylines and character development as opposed to just gore and zombies. After watching all of season 1 i could not wait for season 2. After the fist seven episodes of the walking dead season 2 aired, i realized i had to have more so i ordered the first 8 volumes of the comic book series and i can honestly say that i have never been more entertained and intriqued by a single series. Between The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Hell on Wheels, and Mad Men i can say AMC is more successful than they have ever been.I can not recomend this show more. I grantee if you start watching this show you won't be able to stop
B002MQYOFW|1.0|After getting recommendations from so many people that I lost count I decided to downloaded this book and I have to say I hate the people who recommended it to me. I am aghast the praise these books are getting. The story has a weird pace where nothing happens for dozens of pages and then within a few paragraphs all is said and done. I attributed some of the lack of depth to the fact that this is young adult fiction but it just does not stack up against many of the books in the genre.<br /><br />There is little or no introspection, both from the author or any of the characters, they are petulant short sighted and whiny. (Spoiler?) Katniss goes from being horrified that she has to leave her family to maybe starve to \\"Oooh what a pretty dress\\" in the space of a few hours. She likes to sleep with Peeta but their relationship is purely platonic. Is it just me or does someone else find it hard to believe two teenagers don't really act that way. Both Peeta and Gale are perceptually in love with Katniss though its hard to see why, she is dull, manipulative and self-serving and obviously so.<br /><br />The rules of the games are arbitrary and seem like they were made up as the author went along to suit the particular plot device she wanted to use at that point. Maybe I am too used to Tolkien and Asminov where the integrity and consistency of the universe in which their books reside is more important than the current plot twist. Also I recently read the Game of Thrones series where the characters are multidimensional, introspective and actually change radically during the course of the story. I read this book and wept for more Starks and Lanisters.<br /><br />However even if you overlook all of the problems I have mentioned so far the writing of this book is abysmal. The use of first person for the whole book is annoying, over-use of dialog for trivial conversation and over use of adjectives makes it boring to read. The crude and forced revolutionary overtones are just painful to read and any social commentary about the current reality television fad is accidental. Its more a product of the reality TV era and if it is possible this book is even more shallow and crude that the reality television programs it seeks to provide commentary on.ul to read and any social commentary about the current reality television fad is accidental.

1933633867|4.0|The argument in this book is brilliant, taking the reader on a thoroughly anthropological tour of the oft ambivalent functions and forms of debt that prompts a serious revision of neoclassical economic dogma. Some of the history, however, is drawn out, unnecessarily detailed, and in one section irrelevant (an editing error perhaps?). The first half of the book contains most of the theoretical claims which are then backed up in the second half, but it really gets quite bogged down in parts, and the concluding chapter could have been greatly expanded upon.<br /><br />Whilst offering food for thought on the importance of debt as an explanatory framework of history, Graeber's argument is a little one sided. It seems to me difficult to imagine a modern nation state, as opposed to a small community, in which exchange could be based on anything but an impersonal medium such as money. His depiction of credit systems therefore, whilst fascinating, seems to have little bearing on the modern world. I also feel that Graeber fails to appreciate the importance of impersonal money, debt and credit for innovation, if not explicitly, implicitly by its absence. It is hard to imagine, for example, how programmes requiring massive input of human and material capital could have been undertaken more equitably without money.<br /><br />I lived with an indigenous (and of course, anarchist) community in the Atlantic Forest to conduct fieldwork, and whilst a beautiful, humble and caring society that we have much to learn from, they have not been to the moon, they did not invent the internet, and they are heavily reliant upon modern medicine, and i think what is missing from Graeber's book is an explicit discussion of his view of 'the good society'. If we are to have an advanced technological society I think we have to take the rough with the smooth. It is only if we accept the anarchist form of living that we all know Graeber supports that his claims have any real political purchase, and I'mnot convinced that given the brute facts of the modern world that this is a realistic or even desirable state of affairs. I'm not dismissing these claims entirely, and I would love to be convinced otherwise, but left implicit I think Graeber's work will fall into the intellectually stimulating but practically not useful category, which is a shame.

0545265355|5.0|1984 meets Running Man (the Most Dangerous Game) but sanitized for younger readers.<br /><br />The recent surge in popularity is well warranted. Started reading the first book on a Saturday and finished the trilogy by the next Tuesday night. The books move along quickly, feeling much like a movie (which of course has now been done). The book, while an exciting narrative, also offers a unique first-person experience that allows the reader to quesiton how they would handle similar situations. Plenty of themes to talk about with your kids if they're reading along with you: violence, war and peace, love, relationships, morality, government, politics, etc.  - Also makes great reading for a book club.<br /><br />The book is directed to young adults even though the imagery and themes are very adult adult. Use caution when suggesting to younger readers. Still a worthwile reading experience.<br /><br />Comparisons to the Twilight series are mostly unwarranted. Themes of love and relationships are present across genres and these books (The Hunger Games) are too good to be compared to the popcorn that is Twilight.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing!!! i would reccomend it to any young reader anywhere! it  is exciting, intense and will keep you on the edge of your seat unti the end.

B0073PQ720|3.0|I thought the acting was good at some points, you could tell there was always this emotional tension between the two main characters. I thought for some reason the movie would have more \\"driving.\\" The music, title sequence and timeline felt like a bit of a cheesy 80's movie. I was hoping for more action, suspense and better music. sometimes I felt a little lost as what was going on, didn't seem to make a lot of sense. The killing scenes were also pretty gorey but in, again, a cheesy way.
B005MP28B2|3.0|\\"The Tree of Life\\", which I recently caught on DVD, drops an epic sequence depicting no less than the creation of the universe and the rise and fall of the dinosaurs, smack dab into the middle of a serious drama covering the joys and tragedies of an American family from the 1950's to the present. I just wanted to warn you: yes, you're getting an Art film here, with a capital A.<br /><br />Many of the individual sequences of the film are involving, well acted, and- in the case of the \\"creation of the universe and all life on earth\\" sequence- quite spectacular. But some may find the lack of a traditional story, and the way the disparate parts of the movie don't demonstrate obvious connections with one another, a little frustrating.<br /><br />Myself, I admired more than enjoyed \\"The Tree of Life\\", and have no real desire to watch it again anytime soon. But I'm glad that movies like this can still get made, even if I found this particular movie to be a little dull at times. Anyway, maybe next year I'll check out the film again, after its images and juxtapositions have been percolating in my brain for a while, and see if I have any new impressions.<br /><br />And, yeah, I already have some ideas about how the creation of the universe stuff ties into the scenes of Brad Pitt yelling at his kids in his backyard, but in the end they're just my ideas. You'll probably have your own. And if that's okay with you, you'll probably like the movie at least as much as I did. But if you prefer all your movies to clearly communicate what they're about, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one.<br /><br />\\"The Tree of Life\\" is available in all manner of formats for your home viewing pleasure.  I have to say that the standard DVD I watched looked and sounded terrific.

0439023521|4.0|I loved The Hunger Games from the opening pages. I am not a reader of \\"young adult\\" fiction, and I have disliked or hated many YA novels that were recommended to me: I couldn't stand Harry Potter; I loathed Ender's Game. The Hunger Games didn't initially strike me as a \\"young adult\\" novel at all -- until it's unsatisfying ending. But we'll get to that later.<br /><br />First, the basic premise (no spoilers): The story takes place at some time in the future, perhaps 100 or 150 years from now. The United States of America is no more. In its place, is a nation-state called Panem, occupying much of North America. Its capital is in the Rocky Mountains, and the rest of the nation-state is divided into thirteen regions -- or at least it was. Sometime around seventy-five years before the story begins, the thirteen regions attempted to rise up and secede from Panem, but they were defeated. In fact, the thirteenth region was nuked and is no more. As a legacy of this squelched rebellion, the Capitol holds an event called The Hunger Games each year, where one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining regions are drafted to fight in a televised fight-to-the-death. The purpose of this event is twofold: 1) Keep the decadent citizens of the Capitol entertained, and 2) To remind the citizens of the twelve regions that they are utterly powerless to in the face of the Capitol's might.<br /><br />The world in which this novel takes place is a dystopian one. We mostly know about District 12, where the protagonist Katniss Everdeen lives. It is a coal-mining district in the Appalachians. The people there, and presumably in the other eleven regions, are essentially serfs -- unable to travel to other regions or even leave the fenced-in borders of their own region (legally, at least). They are hungry and starvation is a regular cause of death. Technology in the Capitol is advanced, but Katniss has never even been in a car, and there are rolling electrical blackouts. District 12 is nominally governed by a mayor, but the real powers that be are the \\"Peacekeepers\\" from the Capitol. Luckily for Katniss and her fellow District-12ers, these Peacekeepers are relatively benevolent and turn a blind eye to the poaching and black-market activity that keeps the district's economy afloat. We learn in the book that the citizens of other districts are not so lucky, and their Peacekeepers are more brutal. Perhaps this is a function of District 12 being far from the Capitol.<br /><br />As you can probably guess, Katniss ends up as a participant in The Hunger Games. The story up until this point had me rapt, and once the games begin, things get even more interesting. I devoured the book in a few days, and I loved it the whole way through -- until the last few chapters. At this point, the \\"young adultness\\" of the book revealed itself, as the author simply made things far too easy on the characters. Katniss never really has to make a tough moral choice; everything just falls into place. The author could have explored some deeper moral issues here, but she took the easy way out instead. This is why I have to give The Hunger Games four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Ultimately, The Hunger Games is about the evil of a remote central government and the cruelty of government-sanctioned violence. It can be viewed as an examination of our \\"reality TV\\" culture, mixed with our obsession with war -- so long as we send other people's kids to do the fighting. Violence here is not glorified -- it is dealt with realistically and shown to be horrible and horrifying. I just wish the author would have given her young readers more to think about with a more plausible and challenging ending.ominally governed by a mayor, but the real powers that be are the \\"Peacekeepers\\" from the Capitol.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|play this app its the best one ever I totally recommend it its free and easy :-) :) :-) :.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game. I love that you have a lot of different games to play. I like the different types of games that they have
B000JMLFLW|4.0|This is a  classic novle , I have watched its film and also been impressed by the love story. Not only the languages but also the plot is vivid and glorious.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love it! random deal is fair and challenging.<br />every game is fun and enjoyable. recommended for all levels and ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It has been a while since I have had a book I couldn't put down...this was one of them! I finished it so quick and was turning the pages faster than I was reading them!
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|It arrive on time exactly as expected.  It was in good working order with no problems.  Loved this movie. It is one of our favorites.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A really good look at the zombie apocalypse that reveals a lot about our current world and cultures. Great travel book- engaging but you can put it down and back up again easily.
B0063IH60K|4.0|works consistently well on my kindle fire. very easy to use. nice personalizable features and details. great way to pass a little time without tjinking too hard. highly recommend.
B005BV0BA2|5.0|If you enjoy Iron Maiden's classic metal sound, especially their more progressive side, then this album is as good as it gets...The tunes are fantastic, the arrangements are imaginative and quite elaborate and the playing is absolutely stunning throughout...and Bruce Dickinson has never sounded better. To my ears, this sounds like the perfect Iron Maiden record, or at the very least, it is an amazing culmination of almost a decade of hard work. Although the band has consistently produced excellent work in the two decades following this release, I feel that \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" remains their crowning achievement.
B004FOA84A|3.0|At its foundations, this is a standard \\"Escape the Room\\"-type game, examples of which can be found for free on most Flash gaming sites on the internet. The game progresses in a fairly linear fashion, with the player largely seeking items/clues that remove barriers and reveal new items/clues that remove other barriers. There is one \\"classic\\" puzzle in the game, and the lack of any others gives this game a particularly low replay value. This isn't really a big deal in a sprawling game like Myst, but in a game like this, which is probably winnable in 5 minutes or less if the player already knows what to do, it poses a big problem. It will deliver no more than a few hours of fun on the first playthrough, after which it will be largely useless. Contrast this with a title like Plants vs. Zombies, Fruit Ninja, or Angry Birds, which for a few more dollars offer almost endless replayability, and The Secret of Grisly Manor starts to look a little sad.<br /><br />The primary selling-point here seems to be the graphics, which are admittedly better than those of the free Flash games out there - though not by much, really. Lots of people will probably enjoy this game on its own merits, but I would suggest that experienced puzzlers and adventure gamers spend their coveted $0.99 elsewhere.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|I was using canon's 75-300 telephoto lens before purchasing this one and the difference is amazing!  I can take shots in much darker conditions than before handheld with the assistance of the stabilization, it allows  me to take shots as slow as 1/40 sec.!!!  I have also found that the auto focus is more accurate than my previous lens which saves me time from having to manually focus on subjects.  A great lens for a great price!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Got this book because I was intrigued.  Honestly, it's not that well written and it's only popular because of how discriptive the sex scenes are. Really reminds me of one of those trashy romance novels but with wilder sex.  I'm not a prude or anything, and I'm only 26 years old, but this book is seriously lacking on so many levels...
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Nice app -- first one of it's kind I've ever used -- giving it 4 stars because I have nothing to compare it to.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking Dawn is one of my most cherished books. Meyers did a fantastic job whisking you through the viabrant story full of romance and action. She adds such nice and suspenceful twits in the book that keep you motivated to read more. The fourth book is the best book in the series, in my opinion. From my point of veiw, it is the perfect finale to wrap up the love story that has captued so many peoples hearts.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I did not enjoy this novel as much as I thought I would. The characters are shallow and it is not written entirely well.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Just listened to MDNA in full and I absolutely loved it. As a fan since 1998 - when the masterpiece Ray of Light came out - I have to say that this is her best album since then.<br /><br />There is everything a Madonna - and pop music - fan would want. It's like she took the best qualities - the DNA - of her past works and melded them into one: the great dance hooks of Confessions on A Dance Floor + the introspection of Ray Of Light + the dark edge of Erotica. But make no mistake, the album sounds modern, current and offers something new and fresh to pop music.<br /><br />The standout tracks are Love Spent, Gang Bang, I'm Addicted, Some Girls and Falling Free. This is her most creatively fearless and liberated and inspired work in a long time. The bonus tracks are good too, especially Beautiful Killer - very reminiscent of Beautiful Stranger.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm addicted to her love!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|please add cook1620 daily tipper and gifter. write on wall if you ever need a specific item gifted to you.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Great service the product was in perfect condition came  a week before the date said it would and was at a great price 22 dollers total with shipping  for a blue ray season of 24 great business !!!!!!!
B003EYVXVE|4.0|This movie was kinda rush but you have to expect that with any movie and it wasn't really was that voilent which i was expecting. I guess they made the bloody part less gory so it could be PG- 13.I liked it though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|You cant complain when someone does the job you ask of them. AccuWeather gets the job done accurately. videos are available to view real weather also! that was a plus. I like it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|One of the great all time movies ever made.  Finally, I have the edition I want at a super price! I'm not in love with Part III (very few are), but it has it's moments.  But unlike III, Parts I & II are seamless, perfectly rendered films. They are classics for one reason -- we keep going back to them!
B000FVE3BG|5.0|I was first impressed by the watch because I really liked the combination of the blue and gold, and I must say, it really does look nice in person. I had some trouble deciding between this watch and the Invicta 1516 because the 1516 had a 1/10 second dial, but this one had the nice brown leather strap. Well I went with this watch, and to my surprise, mine did have a 1/10 second dial as well as a 12 hr dial for the chronograph, unlike what is described and pictured here. The tag on the watch said it was a 3329, so I guess Invicta has just updated the model a bit from when it was first made.<br /><br />Like others have said, it is a large watch. People will see you wear it and comment on the size of the watch. It is not just the face of the watch that is large; the strap is pretty large too compared to other watches I have worn. I wear it on the second to last or the last hole (tightest possible) depending on how frequently I have worn it and how stretched out the leather is that day. I don't think I have small wrists either.<br /><br />I have had the watch about three weeks, and I have not had any issues with it yet. Everything functions properly, and it keeps time well.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|I don't intend on making this review long, as the other positive reviews pretty much say it all.  I have been a Dream Theater fan for many years, and being a guitar player, a big fan of Steve Morse even longer.  This is the first album in a long time that I have enjoyed from beginning to end, finding something I like about every song.  I really appreciate the the change in feel with each.  You want to listen to something in the metal genre?  It's there.  A little jazz or classical feel?  It's there too.  I really enjoy listening to my traditional artists (Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Mike Portnoy) while being introduced to others I haven't (unfortunately) had the pleasure of listening to before (Neal Morse, Casey McPherson).  Hats off to Mike Portnoy for his diverse projects which lead me to these other great talents.
B00004SC3M|5.0|They just dont make movies like they used to anymore.. i think the casting and plot of this movie is great. Excellent movie.
B001CDZ40K|5.0|Excellent book, easy instructions with practical ingredients. Would recommend to anyone. I'm thinking of purchasing other tittles inspired by Julia Childs
B004UID2LC|4.0|Works great with a Toshiba thrive and Motorola Razr.<br />search features and saving could use a little work...be nice if you could DL from other sites aside from just you-tube
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I would really like to be able to change the width of lines.  Otherwise, it is easy to use, but has few features.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is great. my kids love to play it. it's also very addicting too. easy to play and great way to socialize nonlinear.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is a really new and different set of levels.  I really enjoyed it.  I can't. wait for the update.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun and adventure, created with unbelievable performance capture and the highest quality animation.<br /><br />For fans of the original Tintin books by Herge I think this movie will not disappoint.  Although the format is totally different than the original hand drawn books, showing much greater detail and more vivid color on screen, they have managed to keep true to the feel of Tintin.<br /><br />Initially I was disappointed that the producers/writers took the liberty of combining elements from a couple of different Tintin books, but in the extras they do explain their thought process on making these adjustments.  I'd still prefer pure movie versions of the unadulterated Tintin books, in this same quality, but I can't complain about this product.  It is really well done and lots of fun.<br /><br />The picture quality on blu-ray is dazzling; certainly better than when I saw it in the theatre in 3D.  The extras are good as well, giving an insight into the production process as well as a little bit about the background of Tintin.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|I purchased this CD/DVD version to assuage the fact that I couldn't afford to see James in concert this summer (2012).  While the DVD was wonderful, the CD has a lot of odd edits of the live show.  While you certainly get all of the songs played, you also get chunks of comments made by James and Carol.  That would be OK if the \\"chunks\\" flowed and didn't occasionally end in the middle of a sentence.  The DVD demonstates that the comments were appropriate and humerous; I simply wished they'd have included either all or none of the \\"byplay\\" between the two great artists.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am a beginner at learning the Bible. I find this app awesome and easy to use. I have just started my first Bible study and it has made it a lot easier than using my kjv Bible. I only wish it would work without wick. that is the only draw back. mot a big enough problem to hove it less than 5 stars...
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Wow! I won't go into details about this book as it's all been said before by other reviewers. I just wanted to add my name to the list of fans. What intense internal conflict! The characters are so well drawn they almost jump off the pages. Christian Grey is the ultimate damaged hero, yet the author makes him sympathetic. Some have complained about the quality of the writing, but I found the book well written. What matters is the story and author's voice and both were phenomenal. I've read all three books in the trilogy now and have fingers tightly crossed that E.L. James will write the story from Christian's viewpoint. (Continuing the short excerpt at the end of book three that is in Christian's viewpoint.) This story and the characters will stay with me for a long time.
B0040JHL5O|3.0|First time i have tried brooks, love the steady feel and support that it can give. Used it for several races and training runs. Only particular observation i have is its a little hard on the forefoot, but great on midfoot.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I ordered it directly from Joe's web site and got it a week in advance.  Great show and am looking forward to the CD version that I suspect will be released sometime in the future.  My favorite live show of his is still the Albert Hall show, but this is almost as good and every JB fan should have it.<br /><br />I don't usually watch the extras, but this one had some interesting moments.  Very respectful to an elder musician.  Great show, what are you waiting for?  Order it today!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|What a wonderful, exciting read....In the beginning I thought the book was more suitable for Tweens but the plot develops so quickly that you soon forget that. Katniss is a perfect heroine for the 21st century. A survivor in every sense of the word.
B004J4WL50|3.0|The 3 stars I gave the book do not reflect the fabulous busines idea and the good that Blake and his company Toms is doing in the world today.  I give Blake and his team a lot of credit for conducting a for profit business with the aim of helping so many people with such a seemingly simple gift as shoes (and now also glasses).  The book gives you a good feeling but it doesn't quite cover as much territory as I hoped it would - it's a bit shallow in content but I am nonetheless happy that I read it.  One section of the book that I enjoyed and agreed with was the part about minimalizing and living with fewer posessions.  I have been shedding myself of possessions for some time now and find life so much more manageable and simple.  Buy the book and then donate it to a friend.
B005MGAM82|5.0|Very convenient 4 Volume set instead of bing split into 5. Happy with the product and the book series in general.
B0000009SY|5.0|Talk about some deja-vu. This album came out late seventies-early eighties and just in time. Frank challenged all comer's to his musical genius.Some call his intrinsic,incredibly complex rifts as musical noodling to those naysayer's my response is \\"Man your cheese has slipped off your cracker\\". The incredible thoughts about politics and the goings on in society kept \\"Zappa\\" on his toes producing music that will be as remembered as Bethoven or Bach.His history as well as his musical journey is one you should explore for there are gems of musicology unlike, anything you have ever listened to.
0812550706|5.0|Simply put: this book is still relevant to today's readers.  As a young man getting ready for boot camp, I found this book helpful in considering what the proper role of the military is in the world.  This book also does a fantastic job of helping readers understand the sacrifices involved in the creation and use of super weapons.
B005Q5OLC2|3.0|I really enjoyed this- it's very light reading and would be ideal to take on holiday. It's the tale of Eilis, a 1950s Irish girl, who is encouraged to move to the States where there's more opportunities. We follow her new life- her lodgings, her job in a shop, her evening classes and social life until there's an unexpected event and she faces a crossroads in her life.<br />Perhaps the problem I have with this perfectly pleasant bit of chick-lit is the cover with its quotes that imply it's something literary- a 'masterwork' that could 'haunt your life'. If you read it on the basis of these you'll be disappointed. Buy it as a holiday read and you'll be quite happy.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I saw this movie Saturday and loved it.<br />I only the atrocious thing about this movie was the marketing. John Carter? Most people don't know who John Carter is. They should have said \\"From the creator of Tarzan comes Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars.\\"<br />People would know and Disney would have a hit on their hands now.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Great movie to add to my Transformers collection! I love how they blended 1960s space travel/moon landing in with the plot. Lots of action, explosions, adult humor and suspense. Everything you'd expect from Michael Bay.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This first season of the show is so so so amazing! While the first few episodes are a tad cheesy, you'll definitely get hooked. This show has everything! Romance, action, mystery, drama and of course vampires! If you're a fan of Twilight and even if you're not, definitely check this show out!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Bought this for my 10 year old Daughter. She loves it. I found many of the song a little sad so this is not one to listen too if your feeling down and depressed. Was worth ever award however. Beautifully done, flawless.
0061120073|5.0|I am so sad to say good bye to the characters in this book. It was a great read. I loved seeing the little girl in Brooklyn grow up to be a strong young woman. I loved the message of the tree. . . that beauty can grow and overcome the harshest of circumstances.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Truly, the Best So Far. Every song rocked out and this will be one I replace due to wear over time. can't get enough! Does have quite a bit of profanity but hey, it's Pink?!
B007FH9GT2|5.0|This is a very enjoyable European style suspense/thriller. Ms. Mara is absolutely fantastic in the role of Lisbeth. If you like your female leads to be strong, active, and kick-butt, you'll enjoy her performance. I hadn't read the books at all so could fully enjoy a brand new story and it did not disappoint.
B000YPWDSS|3.0|Was surprised but the bonus track. Found many of the song to sound alike. Not as outstanding as I thought it would be but the woman had a powerful voice and great talent. Great to listen to on a mellow day at home with a book.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I \\"purchased\\" this app last week when it was the Free App of the Day, and have really enjoyed the few minutes I've been able to play of it. Unfortunately, I'm experiencing many of the same problems that others are mentioning in their reviews and it is with great trepidation that I open this app now.<br /><br />The first thing that I notice upon opening the app is that the sound is broken. Even after turning the music and sound effects off in the options menu, my Droid X makes a constant stream of clicking noises that will only go away if I mute the media volume on my phone.<br />Secondly, this game takes a long time to load. Longer than any other app I've ever used.  I'm never quite sure if it's actually loading or if it has hung my phone.<br />Finally, it hangs my phone. 100% of the time. Loading this app is like a time bomb for my Droid X, since the interval until it completely stops responding is fairly random. The screen will lock up and my phone stops reacting to any screen or home/back button presses. Tapping the power button to turn off the display will often make my screen go black (after 10-20 seconds) but it is then impossible to re-wake the phone afterward.  In one instance my phone rebooted itself, but every other time I've had to resort to pulling out the battery to regain control of the phone.  I even plugged the phone into a charger and let it sit for about 20 minutes, hoping that whatever process the app was stuck on would eventually sort itself out and resume normality. No such luck.<br /><br />Pros: I've never had this app force close on me<br />Cons: I really, really wish it would - it would prevent me from having to yank my battery each time I attempt to play DoodleGod<br /><br />All of this is really a shame. What I've seen of the game has been a lot of fun, and I can imagine myself getting quite addicted to it.  I really enjoyed a different Alchemy app that I used to have, but DoodleGod has an infinitely better UI than that other game.
B00782O7NE|2.0|I'm still trying to figure out why THE ARTIST swept the Oscars.  I feel that so many of the people who loved it haven't seen a \\"real\\" silent movie.  I find it sad that this movie won for Best Picture, when the best film about movies is SINGING IN THE RAIN, and it did not recieve a nomination for picture sixty years ago.  I certainly think HUGO was the movie of the year to see if you want to see a homage to cinema history.  It was magical and a joy to behold.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I haven't used the Forerunner 405CX yet but am writing this as a \\"heads up\\" to potential buyers.  I thought I was savvy enough to be able to read the manual (including the manual in the pdf file) and figure out how to use this sports watch.  I also thought that by reading a bunch of reviews and seeing the helpful hints, I'd find what was missing in the manuals.  I spent a whole day fooling around with the sports watch getting more and more frustrated.  Then I took a look at the first video on the garmin.com/learningcenter website.  Wow, it sure looked easy --spinning around the bezel. But it didn't work for me. The next time and every time after that I went back to the learningcenter website, I was sent to the \\"buy garmin\\" screen.  What the devil?  In the end I thought the sports watch was defective.<br /><br />Finally my tech-savvy computer-smart husband got interested, especially when he saw me winding up to throw the sports watch against the wall.  He's been working with the 405CX for a couple of days (oh yeah).  His conclusions: (1) the 405CX is a marvelous invention, packed with superb features, (2) all of the manuals are pretty useless, including the manual in the pdf file, (3) the 10 or 12 videos found in the learningcenter are the best resource to learn how to use the sports watch.  He told me that at some point I had turned it off (news to me) so nothing I did worked.<br /><br />In retrospect I wonder if the Garmin sports watch that has the on/off button wouldn't have been enough for me.  There's something to be said about simplicity, but this is the one I bought.  If you don't really need all of the bells and whistles, maybe you don't need the 405CX. Review the other Garmins and see if a simpler one will suffice.<br /><br />LATER IN THE DAY:  It appears that I convinced myself that the 405CX was much more than I needed because I sent it back. The truth of the matter is that I read a review of the 610 on gpstracklog.com and discovered that the bezel business is not just a pain in the neck for me.  The 610 is the newest Garmin sports watch and has buttons, plus a much better user interface.  It's more money than is warranted for my needs.  The reviewer suggested the Garmin 110:  it has on/off buttons and just a few measurements. It works pretty much like the computer on my bicycle and my heart rate monitor watch. Sounds like the 110 would be appropriate for me.  But I'm not taking any chances:  I have turned this project over to my husband and told him to find me what I need.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Fun, fast-paced, modern, exciting. I can't say enough about this new version of Sherlock. If you are a mystery tv fan or a Sir C A Doyle fan, this is a must-see.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Maybe i'm just over the birds... I was so excited for a new AB, but feel let down. I can't explain it but this new version is just boring.
B007MS5B6Q|3.0|The inaugural season of The Walking Dead raised enormous expectations with its balanced blend of horror, action, and serious adult drama, coupled with high production values and hints that the series would play out on an epic scale. Season Two (aka \\"Escape from Hershel's Boring Farm\\") started to systematically undermine those expectations and change the very nature of the show.<br /><br />The action and horror elements quickly receded into the background after the brilliant herd sequence in the season opener. Every drama needs rising and falling tension, but the show dramatically slowed its pace, focusing on life at a Georgia farm, and morphing into a rather overwrought soap opera--a sort of \\"One Life to Live\\" with the occasional token zombie. The show's setting became so confined that it was easy to forget that there had even been a total breakdown of society; Season Two just wanted us to take it on faith that there was something scary over the hill. And without the horror elements, the show in essence becomes an American version of the BBC's post-apocalyptic series Survivors.<br /><br />Some rambling, repetitive writing and mediocre direction didn't help matters. (The lack of Frank Darabont's input this season is striking.) Those great \\"Walking Dead Moments,\\" where a character is stuck in a horrific situation and forced to make a gut-wrenching decision came less frequently or became so predictable that they ceased to make much impact.<br /><br />But stick it out: by the end of the season, things are mostly back in swing, and the show we came to love from Season One appears to be more or less back on track. There are some shocking and heartbreaking dramatic moments, as well as unexpected deaths. By the final episode, the group is again on the run, fighting to survive both the walkers and their own worse natures. (The show is at its best when it balances both those threats.) Now, if the creators and directors can balance the ethical/psychological elements with a renewed integration of action and zombie horror, we'll be in for a thrilling Season Three. If it's just a group of frightened, selfish, confused people bickering in a prison, it will be a requiem for what might have been.<br /><br />In Season Two, the makeup design is still superb, but the visual effects are still hit or miss, with too much of the spraying blood looking like dodgy, 300-style CGI. Audio effects are as comically over the top as in the first season: every time a walker is killed, it sounds like someone whacking a giant rotten watermelon with a sledgehammer. Once again, the show's comic book roots show, with characters performing utter miracles of marksmanship with the greatest of ease.<br /><br />(Btw, what's up with T-Dog? Is he a \\"Red Shirt\\" the producers forgot to kill? The poor character had maybe three lines in the entire second season. Apparently he spent most of his time snoozing in a hammock behind the farmhouse. Season Three will tell...)<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray/DVD set itself: be wise and wait for the inevitable Gold Platinum Extra-Special Super-Deluxe Edition that includes more extras than the initial release--as was done with the various releases of the first season.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very badly written.  What doesn't make sense is why someone like Grey would want to dominate a girl who is unsufisticated and a ding dong such as Ana.  I just couldn't finish this book and don't understand all the hype.  I'm assuming the marketers of this book owe their success to the general sheep mentality.  I would categorize this book under porn with bad dialogue.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very good app but it is not very easy to get points when you run out.other than that I'm enjoying it have fun!!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Having watched all of the 7 seasons at once,I think that this series is better than 'The Wire'.<br />A batch of police and detectives are shoved into the middle of the worst suburb of the city in LA by the politicians to contain racial hatreds and rivalries and the worst examples and effects of the drug war.Their own weaknessesand temptations makes the whole effort a tragedy.<br />The only effective way to fight the collapse of this society in to become more like the people with whom they are struggling and who destroy anyone who tries to reform from within.<br />Children will not go to school because they make more money by selling drugs and relying on the worthless relevance of violent gangs.<br />Why become a doctor if you can make yourself rich this way?<br />Thse only way to destroy the power of the drug lords and remove tempation from outsiders who become corrupt,is to get rid of drug related crime by registering addicts and prescribing drugs from hospitals or specific medical clinics at cheap rates.<br />But society will implode before our politicians feel the electorate can accept this solution.<br />'The Shield' is a Shakespearean work of prime, character driven drama.The realistic violence,which many people in Australia decry,is wholly realistic and necessary to reveal the dissolution of the main characters and the inabilty of 'innocent' people to cope with the changing moral boundaries of this collapse.<br />The last thirty minutes are as harrowing as anything I've seen'.I am am still amazed at the quality of this writing and chacterisation.Great art.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is great.  There's very little jitter, the interface is responsive and fast, and it works without a hitch.  There's no subscription or fees past the $4.99 for the app itself, which was a huge selling point for me.  One caveat is that you'll have to set your start menu to not auto-hide, otherwise you'll have to use a keyboard shortcut to use it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think this game is kind of.like travian in the way that you can only do so much each time you use the ap. and that is good for a quick bit of fun.
B0054W4JQK|2.0|Before I Go To Sleep is about a middle age woman with amnesia. It was very repetitive, but in hindsight, I suppose it had to be to capture the sense of realism. It wasn't a thrill a minute by any stretch, but it did keep me interested enough to reach the all too obvious end. Sorry, but I can only rate this as average at best.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I love looking at the silly things that ancient people believed in. once upon a time. how the snake lost his legs, the best time to sell your daughter into prostitution, yadda yadda. its hard to believe that this was once supported by one of the most powerful organizations as 'beyond question' but its got some good parts in it too.
B004V9MU86|5.0|The Book Thief is a compelling, compassionate and beautiful read. Raw and heartfelt, my whole family (incl boyfriend!) fell in love with this book. It's a definate must.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|game was initially fun but after the first part,  I'm able to combine only a couple elements before the game slows to a crawl and I have to exit out and go back in.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is really fun if you like to get more than just one game out of an app. I love it. I really like that it has a wide variety of games. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
0091922348|5.0|A long-time follower of his column in the Guardian, I am a huge fan of Ottolenghi's cooking, recipes and approach. Fresh ingredients, lusty flavors, colors and tastes that pop... every mouthful is like a sped-up trip around the Mediterranean. I ordered this cookbook from the UK when it first came out as I couldn't wait for a US version. I can figure out the conversion with some good kitchen gadgets, but I'd love to see a version that includes both US + UK measurements in the future. This has been my go-to cookbook for quite some time now and I have tested only about 25% of the recipes, as they all seem to be winners so I tend to go back to the same (delicious) ones over and over. (My faves: Harissa-marinated chicken w/grapefruit salad (unbelievably good!), chilled red pepper soup, seared duck breasts w/ blood orange sauce.) However, this weekend I finally tried a new recipe (mushroom/celery/wheat salad) and, once again, was thrilled with the results.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This is the best DVD collection I have ever purchased. The book it comes in is really cool and the best part of course is you get all the Smallville DVD's. If you already have most of the seasons though I would say just finish buying the few you do not own, but if you only own a couple then definitely buy this and sell those.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ok i guess but it is more of a lil kid game so i just let my little brother play this game sometimes
0307959856|2.0|OK, I'm an Austen fan and have read quite a few of the wannabees.  This attempt does a major disservice to the Janeites who yearn for more of her wit and style.<br />How did P.D. James manage to make Lizzy so dull and lifeless?  And poor Darcy, the crime of this novel is what has been done to him.  James apologized \\"to<br />the shade of  Jane Austen...\\" but for the wrong reason.  It's not just weak and silly plot that  offends but the ego of taking a classic and spoiling our<br />memory of Austen's great characters and bright writing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved watching the first season of Downtown Abbey and regretablly I missed the entire second season.  I purchased the DVDs for the second season right before I was headed on a ski trip so that I could watch it when the weather was too cold.  I enjoyed watching the second season while we were away in the mountains.  The series is very engrossing and I think the second season was even better than the first.  I will definitely make sure I catch the third season when it airs.
B0013TTLDE|1.0|try as i might, i could not finish reading this book.  it was absolutely the most tedious and boring story i have ever tried to read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! It has so much and can keep my little brother occupied! :) Thank you 101! woo hoo!
B0044IIBU0|5.0|I bought the book because there is a movie coming out on it.  I like to compare movies and books.  The book is slow in  some parts.  I'd order it again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is sooooooooooo much fun its the best ever I play it every day after school its the best. my friend says its ok but I say its awesome. my mom says I'm addicted to it but I'm not ok yes mabey l am just alittle bit.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|From the first page of Fifty Shades of Grey to the last page of Freed I was enthralled.  It's been a while since I've read books that have consumed my thoughts the way this series did.  It had it all: suspense, heartache, intrigue, coy banter, pant worthy sex scenes, and even managed to irritate the hell out me on numerous occasions, but did this cause me to toss it aside--NO.  I was just too captivated.  I even laughed that I found myself so irritated by a book.  Yep, that's quality writing (and yes there are typos within the pages--James was an indie after all).<br /><br />James' character development is what sold me.  We have a full understanding of who Ana and Christian are, and no, they are far from perfect (particularly Christian).  Early on I questioned whether I could feel any compassion for a character like Grey, but James accomplishes this smoothly, and suddenly I found myself in love with this man.  She creates a chic with grit in Ana (although Ana's self-doubt and whininess caused a few exasperated huffs and eye rolls), but Ana's clever and intelligent, knowing there's a man worthy of love in Christian and she doesn't give up hope.<br /><br />I've never donned a cheerleading uniform, but I certainly did with this series.  I rooted for love to conquer all in this gut wrenching Romeo and Juliet.  At one point in the series, I even skipped through the BDMS to get back into the plot just because I had to know what would happen next.  LOL. You know you're captivated when you're dodging sex scenes.<br /><br />My only complaint is the kindle price.  10 buck for kindle... Come on! However, it was well worth the read and I'll definitely reread.
1451627289|5.0|I bought this recently - and I haven't been able to put it down.  I even bring it to work to read during my lunch hour.  This book is absolutely amazing.  It's a big read - but definitely worth the time to put into it.  From page one and on the intensity never stops, in fact, it continually builds.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so fun it is great for any one you should get this game awesome awesome awesome awesome
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is great for someone who doesn't have a Kindle. It is easy to use and get for reading and since you always have your phone you always have a book.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Bluey has done it again. This cd is... well... surreal!!! It is music at it's finest. It's right up there with the time when music was at it's finest - the '70s. It's uncommon today for a cd release to have more than two or three good songs and very rarely do they have a GREAT song. This Incognito cd, \\"Surreal\\" has ALL good songs and multiple GREAT songs. Highlights: Maysa shines (as usual) on two songs and makes the cliche'ish \\"The Less You Know\\" sound refreshingly new. Mo Brandis opens your eyes and makes \\"Goodbye To Yesterday\\" pop right out at you and then Natalie Williams draws you right back in with \\"Above The Night.\\" What a way to begin a cd!!! Cruise on toward the middle and Vanessa Haynes breaks it all down on the superbly smooth sounding plea, \\"Don't Break Me Down.\\" What a GREAT song!Just one of the superbly written songs I might add. After that Natalie Williams gives us a moment to reflect and look at \\"The Stars From Here\\" where she takes a previous Incognito sound and adds the uniqueness of her voice to lull us to sleep. Wonderful. Vanessa then teases us on the beginning of \\"To Be With You\\" like she's going to let us dream, then BAMM!!! awakens us like she really means 'to be with you.' The cd ends with two of the funkiest tunes since the '70s. Vanessa takes us to a new place on the next to last song, \\"The Way You Love.\\" This song gives Vanessa Haynes a signature Incognito song similar to the ones Bluey has penned for just about all the \\"Cog Family\\" women. This is a GREAT song. The final cut, \\"Thoughtful Fantasies\\" is essentially a signature funky Incognito instrumental with some nice background vocals. These two songs bring back the funk and nothing but the funk! Musicianship on this cd is top notch. Rhythm section is awesome as usual. Brass section is thoroughly \\"horny,\\" yes tight, as usual. Sorry I can't fully speak on the actual recording because my main system is not currently set up. But even so, my secondary system is no sloutch and the recording does seems to be top notch. Believe it or not there are songs I did not mention. Don't be surprised if you find one of them to be your favorite. Altogether there are 14 songs!!! I have EVERY Incognito album / cd. I like EVERY one of them and LOVE most of them. Still THIS CD, SURREAL, IS THE BEST. Most groups peak and then fall off at some point. But then Incognito isn't like most groups. They just keep getting better. -- See you at B.B. KINGS for the Incognito show on April 1, 2012!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|keeps you interested... lots of different. games so there is something for everyone... I would recomend this game.  even my two year old can play ..
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Food Inc does a great job of exposing several things:<br /><br />Where your food comes from and why you should care<br />What the animals go through<br />What it can do to your body<br />How it's hurting the farmers<br />Who is profiting from it all.<br /><br />It's very multidimensional. Rather than just focusing on how certain food is bad for you, but it also focuses on how it got there, and who is suffering.<br /><br />Long story short: it will send you to the farmer's market and organic section every time. It's a shame that many people can't afford the extra cost involved with doing so.<br /><br />A movie that will knock you off your foundation and change the way you eat.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Angry Birds is terrible. It's a garbage game that copied Crush the Castle. The overwhelming popularity of it is really sad and indicative of American culture at this point. Don't help our downfall by playing this nonsense.
B0019EXZYE|1.0|slow movie which starts out with soft porn (naked people) and continues this throughout the movie to generate some interest. I shut it off at about the half way mark.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great fun, can get caught up in the game and lose track of time.<br />good brain exorcise.<br />the best of solitaire.
0061733199|5.0|This guide contains a fair amount of common sense (though as we know, it's not always so common, so it's good that it's in there) but also has a great deal of step-by-step instructions for more complicated survival techniques.  The color photos help, especially in the edible plants section, but some of the drawings in the other sections take a moment of study to understand fully. This guide covers most any area of the world one might find themselves, so it does get a bit tedious reading through tips specific to those areas (for example: the arctic) in order to find information that might pertain to another area during a specific season (Montana in the winter).  That slight inconvenience aside, this is an excellent book that I am very glad I purchased as one of the first steps in building a B.O.B. as it suggests items to include and provides knowledge on how to use them.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good survival guide.
B003O86MY8|3.0|This is a very good cd, but it tickles me to see on the cd notes, how David claims this type of music has never been done like this before. Vanessa Mae has been doing this for years... and sorry David, she is a much better musician than you.
B007G5K066|2.0|Honestly I do enjoy spy movies and dramas. I couldn't wait to see this movie, but in the end it was so boring that I could hardly watch until the ending.
0062082353|5.0|Many books moralize or condescend to tell how I should view actions, motives, or values.  This autobiography is what an autobiography should be like.  I want to know how a person felt and responded--without dressing it up or putting up a facade.  I wanted payback, too.  But, I think the author is very harsh on himself.  I could no longer be in the health care profession due to my health, and I felt that I let my peers down.  I wish only the best for him, his family and his goals of helping other veterans.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|The book is short and nicely written, so it's definitely worth the quick read. It is a good update on the standard philosophical discussion on free will. Can this concept be scientifically defined? What does it mean for a decision to be free? Are we free?<br />Unfortunately, despite the references to new scientific discoveries and the honest intellectual perspective taken, with many references to authors from \\"the other camp\\", there are no new angles to this old question in this book.<br />In other words, the essay is a refreshing update on the question and a good summary of some of the arguments, but not a new stepping stone.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Just watched Courageous today at Church and wow. This movie is powerful and every man needs to watch. This movie addresses the issues many men have in their household, too busy for their families. Too often men, including myself, are so busy and we take for granted the ones closest to us...our families. We do not take a stand with our wife and kids and definitely do not always put God first. Life is tough but when you allow God to be the head of your household and live the principles of the Bible things are clearer. This movie has 4 men who are in different phases of their lives but yet so similar and shows how faith in God helped them grow. It has some funny parts to it and some very serious parts. Life is full of ups and downs and how we adjust and respond is crucial to the solution. If you put God first and truly seek Him for the answers it will help your life out immensely. It won't always be easy but is more than worth the struggle to do it God's way. This movie shows real examples that some of us are currently living. This movie shows that be an upstanding man of God is the right thing to do despite what our society has adopted as the right thing. Its time for men to stand up and be COURAGEOUS.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I really enjoy this soundtrack, Daft Punk did a great job with their first full soundtrack.  It is great dance music with a hint of classical intermingled.  I was really excited about this soundtrack when I found out Daft Punk was doing it as I am a fan of their work.  It did not disappoint.  If you enjoy dance music or like Daft Punk you should check this album out.
B006Z21ZEM|1.0|And early next morning they wake up and head off half asleep to play some equally tired tunes to an audience that just hasn't wised up. With a head swimming with unresolved issues and images from watching horror films the night before, complete with Nicko prattling on about absolutely anything he fancies, they discover a set list that looks like one from a year before or more. Happily, the gear has arrived bearing travel tags from 40 other destinations, and so has Gers, fresh from a salad throwing party hosted by fans from the Gers Is Still In Maiden Appreciation Club.<br /><br />Steve wasn't immediately available. He insisted on staying back at the airport so that he could squat down on the conveyer belt and ride the treadmill for an hour because as he explains it with a foolish child grin, that it gave him 'a boundless joy that is beyond expression.'<br /><br />The same old ride rolls out on stage with Bruce's personal snake oil having the Chilean crowd hooked at every turn, their money left to burn. And all that fun to be had, even before they launch into 1984's classic filler, 2 minutes 2 midnight!<br /><br />As their life boat sails away, they've got one last chance to try! And Bruce seizes that chance as he shouts at the audience, 'YOU sing it!' If only they had ... if only they had...<br /><br />The tale has already been told about the failed 'epic song' ideas that went into the making of the Talisman, Dance of Death and When Every Thing Blows. But to hear the Mariner retell his tale to a spellbound audience in a series of silly howls, you'd go away thinking there is some substance to the story. Whether it is wilful amnesia or a desire to keep the Maiden Casino rolling, the old man will carry on, the spell unbroken. Not a sole Chilean this night, has an epiphany during Coming Home, to yell loudly, 'HEY IS THIS SOME REALLY STUPID MERDE OR WHAT?!'.<br /><br />And during the next song Dance of Death, both the band and audience were mysteriously and mercifully killed, after which their spirits carried on unaware through the rest of the set, doomed to relive their awful setlist experience for all eternity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever and is very addictive and fun for everyone bet any one who reads this will agree
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Im very happy with this digital copy of the first 4 books in this series. Very easy to buy and download and works well on my Samsung Galaxy 10, using the kindle app!!!
B005G8WKCC|5.0|There are certain albums over the years that I believe qualify as essential/must-own albums for any fan of progressive music, both classic and current. For me, albums such as \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" to \\"Metroplis 2: Scenes from a Memory\\", \\"Milliontown\\" and \\"Bridge Across Forever\\" would be good examples of \\"essential prog\\" and for my money, Bilateral is as well.<br /><br />While it's not as instantly accessible as some of the other albums that I mentioned, it's well worth the investment to get into their head space because once you do, the music comes alive and is just absolutely brilliant. For me, it took 4-5 spins to really \\"get\\" what they were doing, but once I got there, it's proving to be one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.<br /><br />Not only are they very talented musicians who are technically proficient and write great music, it's very original which is what really sets them apart from a lot of progressive bands who can shred and even produce some enjoyable songs, but don't really push the boundaries. As for their sound......imagine 1 part Riverside, 1 part Shaolin Death Squad, throw some Nu Metal growling offset by some beautiful Muse/Queen style vocal arrangements and a myriad of other influences and you get a sense for how much fun this band is.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to fans of progressive music UNLESS you are really more a fan of the classic 70's prog-scene and aren't a big fan of some of the heavier elements found in today's prog-music. While those heavier elements don't dominate the album - and aren't even in some of the songs - they are ubiquitous enough that they might detract from your ability to enjoy the album. I will say this, I myself am not a big fan of the growls in Death or NU metal but they didn't bother me at all on this album, especially after the first few spins.
B000Y5JFNY|2.0|The review is for this Blu-ray Limited Edition version. The movie is a definite 5-star film.<br /><br />We own this on VHS and DVD already, but wanted to see if there was any improvement over the 40th anniversary DVD transfer. Unfortunately, it won't play in our Blu-ray player. I have the latest firmware and added the necessary additional memory this disc seems to require, but it never gets past the Fox animated loading logo. After waiting 15 minutes, I gave up. The special features Blu-ray disc plays fine as does the DVD, but something must be strange with the Blu-ray movie disc. I had this issue only one other time when my firmware needed upgrading, but every disc since has played until now.<br /><br />In addition, it was delivered without any additional packaging--no outer carton, bubble-wrap or anything. Just a shipping label stuck to the shrink-wrap! When I checked out the contents, I found that the music box was damaged, but otherwise, still worked...sort of. The tune sounds a little fast and off-key. Nonetheless, since the Blu-ray doesn't seem to work, I'm considering sending it back.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unsure if this book was good at first, but once I started, I could not stop. Wonderful book.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I'm a pretty average, complacent, kinda grandma. I don't \\"get it\\" with lots of parents' complaints about toys and movies.<br />But I was watching this movie (rental) and I told my husband during the incinerator scene that I thought it would be very scary for little kids. The movie is kinda depressing: bullying, abandonment, good guy turns bad, etc.  Overall just not a great kid movie like TS and TS2.  Def recommend you preview this one B4 gifting it to a grandkid.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I try to download the FREE ap and it asks me tor a credit card????? don't like that at all :(
B005K17RU0|4.0|On my kindle it is always running so there is always a notification in the corner. I like it but don't at the same.time. I like the weather channel app better :)
B006UKC566|1.0|I had really high hopes for this movie, yet i'm glad i didn't dump $30 to see this in IMAX, the movie is too disturbing, even for me... The only plus was the visual effects, which after seeing the movie at home in glorious FULL 3D was the finest display of HD digi-motion special effects i have ever seen. Really... If ur stomach can handle the gruesome violence, disturbing torture and suffering, then this film may interest u. Yet if u like the beauty and splendor that was also part of the Mediterranean ancient world, u may want to stay away from this one.<br />Overall, \\"Immortals\\" left a bad taste in my mouth and i wouldn't buy it again...
B006O99SYA|3.0|A large preamble which is necessary up to a point to set the scene however I found it a bit tedious after a while.<br /><br />Quite an interesting read which really took off once the authorities became involved.  Paul gave good insight into life in Peking China in the 1930s.
B007H7XJD4|5.0|This is certainly not the source to learn history, or better, mythology.<br />However, this is a very entertaining movie, with spectacular action.<br />And Mickey Roorke steals the show as the bad guy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is really fun and really addictive!! I love it!! The only cons are that it takes a long time to load and the goals are hard to reach... for me anyway!! Overall it is a really cool game that you should definitely Tryout!! (;
B0031RSA24|5.0|Like all of Dawkins' books, this is very well written.  He's much more moderate than authors such as Hitchen's or Harris, but still offers clear objective arguments which are well supported with evidence.  I bought my mother a copy in the hope she would read it, but unfortunately I don't think she will.  I would love to see this on school reading lists though...
B004LUS390|5.0|This is the best drawing/doodling app ever created for Kindle. There is so much different types of brushes you can use, customize colors, and so much more. I would recommend this to anyone!  ROCKS!!!
B006MGC3VK|3.0|I've been with OSI since their eponymous debut album, and have enjoyed most of what I have heard so far. I own their entire discography on CD and they're in constant rotation in my car, especially \\"Blood,\\" which is my favorite (including this release).<br /><br />These songs offer a bit more variety in tempo and theme than their previous works, which seemed a bit more bent on giving the listener more of a heavy metal experience. I feel like Kevin Moore has finally merged Chroma Key (my favorite Kevin Moore project) with the former, heavier OSI for this album. It does not disappoint. Many tracks are mellow, like the melancholic \\"For Nothing\\" or \\"Indian Curse,\\" while other tracks follow the OSI we already know well - the kind of song that, if heard while driving, will invariably result in a speeding ticket, like \\"Enemy Prayer\\" or \\"Big Chief II.\\" And we even have a \\"progressive\\" exploration in the mix with the closer \\"Invisible Men.\\"<br /><br />Why three stars? First, while the record is enjoyable, no single song instantly grabs me and calls me back like \\"Go\\" or \\"The Escape Artist\\" did from previous albums. This doesn't mean I hate it; it just means I've heard OSI make something more catchy in previous albums. Another reason I docked a star is due to the mastering. This album teeters on the edge of clipping from over-compression and poor brickwalling, which is nearly ubiquitous anymore (especially in rock genres). I posted the official dynamic range results on the justficeforaudio.org DR Database moments ago, and it doesn't look pretty. In fact, the song \\"Invisible Men\\" often yields that tell-tale \\"snap crackle pop\\" you hear in your speakers/headphones when the waveform is clipped; specifically during the first and second crescendos. It will probably be worse for those of you who choose to download the lossy mp3s or AAC files (I'm listening straight off the CD using high-end components and equipment). CDs can only take so much loudness before \\"topping out,\\" and this CDis constantly riding on the edge of the CD envelope, though never GRATUITOUSLY crossing the line. I also felt that the drum mixing was poor - Gavin's bass drum often drowns out the sound around it for a few milliseconds following each drum kick, which has also become common in the metal genre (and, strangely, is one of the trademarks for whoever used to mix former OSI drummer Mike Portnoy's drum kit too). With that in mind, I've heard clipping/compression worse than this, just not from OSI.<br /><br />All in all, if you're already an OSI fan, you'll want to pick this up and give it a spin. If you're just getting into them, try \\"Blood\\" or \\"Free\\" before you go here.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|It is a good (not great) weather app. It is the same as others. It is just an average weather app. Nothing special.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|At the time I am writing my review, there is another book about unrequited love amongst competitors that is enjoying epic popularity.  The Night Circus far surpasses that other book in depth of character, setting, ambiance and story.  While the story centers on two competitors trying to outdo one another, they way they communicate through their talents makes the competition breathe like a living poem.  It's magical, dark, delicate, and fierce.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This is a pointless movie, how did anyone like this?<br />Stay away, the characters are awful.<br />Starts nowhere goes nowhere....<br />This is simply to avoid.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I found this to be very well written book.  I read it with a book club two months ago and often find myself thinking about the story and the richness of the characters.  I have embraced and internalized the story to a point where I will think of it for many years to come.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|4-9-12  UPDATE<br />I just tried to open this app to work on something and it is now telling me that I have to have internet connection............anyone else have this problem??  I've been using it fine before today withOUT any connections.  I don't always have internet connection (ie: at work) but I should still be able to use it.  What gives??<br /><br />I am new to the Kindle world so I'm trying to find apps that would suit my needs.  I came across this app and read all the comments about it.  I decided to take the plunge and try this app.  The Kindle already comes with this kind of app but only as a reader and I wanted more.  I figured the most I would loose is $10.  It is definitely worth the money.  My only thing I wish it had was the up/down and lt/rt buttons to manover through the docs.  If you don't have a stylist (which I don't) you have to be very precise to where you want your curser to go.  Maybe in the next upgrade.  Other than that I like the app.
0439023521|3.0|I thought this was a good, not excellent, book.  It was a quick read (3 days).  I felt it was a solid sketch of a story, but I was left wanting.  The book felt like a draft, not a finished book.  (And I'm not referring to the fact that it had a bit of a cliff-hanger ending; I mean the whole thing felt like it need to be fleshed out.)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series was amazing. Normally not one to appreciate novels written for a post-war era, I was enthralled from start to finish. The author uses beautiful word pictures to convey the images the characters see along with their feelings. The dedication Katniss feels to her family and friends is palpable. I'm recommending this series across the board and wish we could expect a \\"where are they now\\" book 4. I can't wait to see the movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app there are so many games and the more you pass and play the more games you can unlock to play. The games aren't that hard so its easy and fun
B0055S348W|1.0|Does not work with Kindle Fire.  Will not print pdf files.  No need to purchase until fixed. Seems to work fine with everything but pdf files.
B00792EGES|5.0|Alter Bridge has to be one of the most under-rated bands alive. They are incredibly talented at each instrument and just \\"gel\\" together better than almost any band I can think of. Myles voice is one of a kind, Mark Tremonti is easily one of the worlds best guitarists, Flip is a phenomenal drummer, and Brian is killer on the bass. These guys just know how to write music and the LIVE to entertain. This DVD gives you a full experience. The only possible way to get any more real than this is to actually go see them live. You will be amazed at how incredibly good this DVD is...the sound, the visuals, the camera angles, the energy, it's just nothing short of amazing. Do youself a favor and buy this blu ray, pop it in your player and let your surround sound show you what it's made of!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a thorough app. Great for my weather info needs!! Both my husband use it several times a day.
0525423656|3.0|While this book was good overall, I didn't see such character growth at all. Where was Xander? I totally missed his presence in this book, and it would have been much better if he were more involved.<br /><br />I don't believe in Ky & Cassia anymore. I just don't see how their relationship will last. The only reason she chose Ky in the first place was because he was so mysterious and different to her, and she was curious to see more. Now his mystery is going away, and it's boring. I feel their relationship is more about lust then love. I'm hopeful that Xander will play a huge role in the next book.
0316056863|4.0|Really a great read, especially if you like Tina Fey.  Also interesting to follow the work of a woman writer of great talent .  She has an amazing sense of humor.
B000000OUE|5.0|This (originally) was my first ever CD Purchase. More Human than Human was on the radio. I remember then thinking it was a decent album then, pretty good actually...this and the previous one, which I bought soon after...<br /><br />Looking back now that I have it again - MAN what a heavy album this is! This is Rob Zombie at his musical peak, IMO...<br /><br />La Sexorcisto is also a great album, but, this one trumps it and in some ways redefines metal in the 90's...
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Works on Kindle Fire. This application seems more capable, when working with large or more complex Excel files, then the Pro version of the default &quot;office&quot; application pre-installed on the Kindle Fire.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|There is not much to say other than I installed it in my printer, and it recognized it and works fine.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|I know many of you are tired of hearing about Battle Royale, but after seeing Battle Royale years ago, Hunger Games just doesn't have the same impact.  I felt Hunger Games (the movie) was lacking something. It may have been better for me if it had more emotional scenes and violence to get its story across to the viewers.<br /><br />Overall, I rate the movie highly for the settings and special effects.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I finished the first book in the series and absolutely loved it!  I am working on the second one and so far, it is just as good!  Hope the third one doesn't let me down! :)
B002P79KAC|5.0|I admit that I'm a geek, but this has to be the funniest show I have seen since Friends and Frasier went off the air.  I consistantly laugh out loud--especially since I usually watch this on my Kindle while I'm flying.  Plus, youove got to pause at the end for Chuck's vanity note.  Usually as funny as the show it self.  Just really a lot of fun and the whole cast works great together.  If I had to be stuck in a box with Schrodingers cat, I'd want this show with me--and of course ST:TOS.
B005HSL626|1.0|I downloaded this for my granddaughter.  As she was playing, too many pop-up commercials appeared that was disruptive to the game.  I didn't like this, so I deleted the app.
B007MS5B6Q|2.0|I was a huge fan of season 1 of the walking dead and bought the blu ray when it came out,best $20 I've ever spent. I've watched the first season at least 20 times and it never gets old,just a really well done show.<br />Season 2 however is....Ehhh there were like 4 episodes that were decent but totally not worth the $70 price tag that they want here. The main Character Rick slowly became a mega DBag and completely unlikeable,they did nothing the whole season but sit on a farm Talking and occasionally killing a zombie or two....Boring! Like I said,there were about 4 episodes that were actually good but 4 good episodes is far from season saving.<br />Bottom line is save your money and just buy the regular season 2 blu or DVD,this season is FAR from worth it.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Although set during WWII \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" addresses the human condition.  A life of achievement, duty, honor, and respect versus quiet desperation.  We are informed escape is impossible from the prison camp - and it is.  William Holden (a self serving draftee noncom. who has taken the identity of U.S. Officer) has weighed his options, dying in the camp from a jungle enviromnent, overwork, or the whim of an enemy, versus a futile escape. He takes his chance and a miracle happens only to return to the camp.<br /><br />Alec Guiness is the commanding officer of the contingent of prisoners at the camp.  Duty forbids him (or others)futile escape, but he determines to passively fight for conditions which will increase the survival of his command.  The bridge on the river Kwai will aid the enemy but provide the contingencies to make this possible.  The bridge comes to symbolize his greatest achievement and he will be asked to destroy it.<br /><br />This movie has been condemned as ficticious tripe because it claims some accuracy to a real event.  I found it an enduring thought provoking classic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow this is a wonderful game and its addicting. the way it is set up is really just a lot of fun
B006AZZPCM|5.0|a nice tool for capturing videos and playing them later, at your leisure, when you might not have a wifi connection available.<br /><br />Recent versions have offered the ability to include a add on that lets you download & convert the the file to 128k MP3 file; nice when all you want is the music; saving precious space on your device as well since you are not downloading the bloat of the video too.<br /><br />Have a Magical Day
B006WWTKQ0|2.0|This movie show us how we are damaging our world and how is making pain against ourselves because we are affecting our nature day after day about the movie some times you are going to feel sleepy about 3D video with ghosting but good gimmick and audio strong those could be you feel happy.<br /><br />If you are a 3D fan like me buy it, if not rent it first and decide later.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|Took me a little while to get into this one, but once I had finished about 25% of the story it hit this \\"just one more page\\" point of no return for me.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is a very good movie and entertaining you are going to feel inside because the story is so good, about video and audio quality both are very good the 5.1 is really 5.1 with a DTS-HD excellent don't watch it with kids because violence is strong, finally I recommend this movie for buy.
B000062X90|5.0|It had been decades since I had heard this one because, for some reason, this band gets no airplay on the classic rock stations in my region. Once I popped this into my CD player, I was instantly reminded of how this band was a pioneering group in the genre of progressive rock and the concept album. Maybe one reason they aren't played as much is the fact that they didn't go to extremes to make themselves noticed; they just made good music that provoked some thought.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|As a huge lover of Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, I had to watch the show that won an Emmy this year over them.  And wow, am I glad I waited.  If I had to wait every week to see the next episode, I would have gone crazy!  This show is super intense, action-packed, and surprising.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical at first of Claire Danes as a CIA agent.  It felt odd to me and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  However, Danes gives a wonderful performance, and it's shown more and more throughout the season.  Her character, Carrie, has some mental issues, and Danes acting in these scenes is incredible.  She just gets better as the season progressives.<br /><br />The premise is simple enough.  A POW marine named Nick Brody who has been imprisoned for about seven years is found by the American government.  Carrie was told months earlier that there was a POW that turned.  Because his partner died during imprisonment and Brody is the only known POW, Danes assumes that he must be the terrorist.  The whole season is based on that.<br /><br />One of the main questions of the whole show is - Is Brody a terrorist or not?  Damian Lewis plays Brody, and I have to say, he is one creepy and amazing actor.  The dynamics of his family when he returns is also very interesting.  Can you imagine your spouse coming back to you after thinking he was dead, and your children practically don't remember him?<br /><br />This show has themes of country allegiance, loyalty, the importance of family, mental illness, and even love.  It is the perfect combination of suspense and relationships.  However, you will literally be waiting for every episode with bated breath.  It just gets better and better!  I watched all episodes in a row and was up until about 7 in the morning.  I just couldn't stop.<br /><br />Any downsides?  Well, I do wish a few more questions were answered.  I know we need to have things to look forward to, but I felt like the final episode was anti-climactic.  Also, I can't completely judge the show until those questions ARE answered, and we see how the writers choose to move the story along.  This season was so good, that it's going to be very difficult to top it.<br /><br />I'm not even really into the whole terrorist/CIA/government type of show, but I was totally drawn into this. Definitely recommend watching this if you like suspenseful thrillers, regardless of genre!can't completely judge the show until those questions ARE answered, and we see how the writers choose to move the story along.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was the final of the Stieg Larsson Trilogy and all three books were an exciting read. Its a beautiful day in Hawaii and I am on the couch reading these books. Mostly non stop action and story lines were terrific. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatto\\", \\"The Girl with Kicked the Fire\\" are as good as anything else I have read. Sorry the Author passed away after releasing these books. He really knows how to tell a story. The Girl who kicked the Hornets Nest was possibly the best for suspense.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I have NEVER been interested in zombie films or movies.  The closest experience I have to zombies is Resident Evil.  My boyfriend also hates zombies, and said they are the dumbest thing ever.  He said I would have to watch this show on my own.<br /><br />So, I watched one episode and was hooked.  And the boyfriend was too!  As you probably know, the show is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, and the country is being overrun by zombies.  Rick Grimes, a sheriff, was in a coma when the apocalypse came.  He somehow managed to wake up and get out of the hospital, and was on his merry way to find his wife and son.<br /><br />Rick ends up finding a lot more than just his wife and son.  There are places to go, people to save, mysteries to solve, and affairs and treachery to sort out.  I decided to take the gamble and convince my boyfriend to watch the first episode with me, and he was hooked as well!  And that is coming from a guy who has basically hated anything zombie he has ever seen (really, it was like pulling teeth to get him to give it a chance - and now he's dying for the next season).<br /><br />And yes, I do see some very strong similarities to Lost.  I am not trying to get into a big debate on which is better or whatnot, but there are definitely some similarities worth pointing out.  Not to mention, I noticed these similarities way before finding out that it was a common comparison.  Plus, if you are a Lost fan (and there are many), this may engage your interest.  Here are a few of those similarities:<br /><br />-a group of people who know nothing about each other live together and try to survive.  It brings up a lot of themes of loyalty, friendship, and the nature of people.<br /><br />-the show is VERY slow-paced. I watched seasons 1 and 2 back-to-back so this wasn't really an issue for me, but I know it drove a lot of people crazy. Lost was also extremely slow-paced, with plenty of cliffhangers.<br /><br />-it's so character-focused, that sometimes you forget about the other things around them.  Oh yeah, there are zombies in this?  I forgot for a second.  This show, like Lost, is truly about the characters.  How they feel, act, and the methods they take to survive.  The characters act like real people and I find a lot of empathy for some of them.  There are a couple of annoying ones, but there are still plenty zombies left in future seasons :)<br /><br />-Rick Grimes = Jack Shephard.  They both start out as the model citizens (a sheriff and doctor) who are always trying to do what's \\"right and noble.\\"  They take great pride in honor and try to be the team leader.  However, they are both highly flawed and begin to unravel and turn more primitive and scared over time.<br /><br />-no one is safe!  Prepare for unfortunate and heart-breaking deaths.<br /><br />Overall, I am very, very impressed with this show so far.  In this day and age, it is difficult to create something zombie without making it look completely goofy.  Yet somehow, the show is still scary, suspenseful, and has many layers to it.  I would say that if you liked Lost, you will probably love The Walking Dead.  Also, you do NOT need to like zombies at all to like this show.  Like I said, zombies often seem like the backdrop.<br /><br />AMC is on a roll here.  Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and now The Walking Dead!  Too bad production for season three doesn't start until May!acter-focused, that sometimes you forget about the other things around them.  Oh yeah, there are zombies in this?  I forgot for a second.

B00466HM28|4.0|For what this product is, it is great. You know what you're getting, 25-keys, 8 Pads, small AND very light.  It's perfect for the mobile producer. Highly recommended if you're creating on the go, or on a trip somewhere.  I am currently using this while in Afghanistan on a deployment and it's great in size and portability.<br /><br />Only reason it didn't receive 5-stars is because I can't seem to figure out how to program the knobs to work with Reason.  That's it... for some reason, the software doesn't recognize the knobs moving.<br /><br />Other than that, highly RECOMMENDED.  The pads maintain their MPK/MPC feel.
1400049628|5.0|I found it to be entertaining.<br /><br />It's also brought a few things to my mind, just in case there are no zombies, that would be helpful in a doomsday or chaotic event.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Game works well.  Unlock new games with points earned.  Looks a little cheesy.  Graphics could be better.  Its entertaining enough.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|War is 99% boredom, 1% sheer terror. Chris takes the the reader across his numerous deployments as a Navy SEAL sniper and skips the boredom. Great read written by a truly great American.

0439023491|5.0|Picks up just were the first left off. Let me just start off saying what I wonderful series this is. I read the triology in a week and that's unheard of for me. When I was in school it took months to finish a book half this size and with this book I couldn't set it down. So happy that I read this and I definitly reccomend it to anybody who is looking for a good read.
0307450570|4.0|If you're like me, and you can't make your mind up which direction to take your crafty impulses, this book is a must.<br /><br />Instead of a book about certain types of handmaking, Martha Stewart's book pulls from all areas. If you subscribe to the magazine, you will see some familiarity within the book, but that's a \\"good thing\\" for me, because I tend to lose / recycle / give away magazines too quickly.<br /><br />The directions are very thorough with loads of close-up photos. Some of the ideas are very simple and would be fun for kids' parties or just a lazy afternoon, and some are truly gorgeous, gift-worthy items that you can be proud to give.<br /><br />Very recommended!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot express how amazing The Hunger Games is… The whole trilogy is. It is the perfect combination of a rebellion, action story, and a love triangle. Katniss has a perspective that is unlike any other. She is a truly inspiring heroine. The Hunger Games trilogy has a futuristic government that is hauntingly similar to our world… But it is also like the world's past government too. I reccomend this book to everyone, no matter what your taste. It is absolutely amazing!

B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read this book maybe 15 years ago and have since read it ten more times. Many books from your childhood don't translate we'll through the years but The Giver is the exception, I think it gets better. Yes it's relatively short but do yourself a favor and read this, I promise you won't be disappointed. This is my all time favorite book.
0385344228|4.0|The guy had a thought-provoking dilemma: morality vs fierce parental protection.  Should he care more about right/wrong or his son's survival.  It's an interesting question for any parent, but I didn't agree with the guy's choice.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I first read The Hunger Games while working with a high school remedial reading group.  The students loved the book so much, they were asking to read the other two books in the trilogy.  As an adult, I became totally engrossed in the book and wanted to read all three books while on vacation.  Anyone who enjoys lots of action would love this trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved loved loved this book. I won't even elaborate because there are so many great reviews on here, but yeah I LOVED IT
B003Y74AZ2|1.0|The feel of the material is quite soft and that may be its biggest flaw. The case is loose, floppy and a poor fit. The long vertical edges are neither taut enough nor rigid enough to maintain their shape so they flop around like the loose jowls of a basset hound. I bet this design looked fine on a computer screen but in real life it underperforms.
0439023521|4.0|It was hard to not read this book. I had heard so much about it and wanted to read it before seeing the movie version. It took me about 1/3 of the book to get hooked but then I could not put it down.<br /><br />The author does a good job getting her point across without preaching. I felt that the characters were well-drawn and compelling. Katniss with her maturity in the area of survival but her cluelessness when it came to boy/girl relationships, was the most compelling of all. I appreciated the fact that the author did not make her cynical and jaded.<br /><br />All in all, it is a heart-breaking, thought-provoking book and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I will definitely read the other two books in the trilogy and look forward to seeing the movie.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|What a tragic loss and waste of a human life.  This CD is Whitney's absolute BEST! Her range, breath control, and phrasing are possitively impeccable.  It's too early after her passing, to actually believe that we'll never hear or see her perform future releases.

B000ILSRNI|2.0|I got this for a friend because they collect old books, only to find out that the image they provide is not what they sell. They sell the 25th anniversary edition of it, a green book that is fine if you want to read the book but a disappointment for someone who wanted what they were shown.
0812550706|3.0|Recently the book, The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins swept over the country and now has a motion picture coming out. Since I've already read it and LOVED it, I focused on trying to find a book that could be put in the same context as The Hunger Games. The novel, Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card also had children fighting each other while adults watch and somewhat encourage it. Ender Wiggin, the child genius protagonist, was carefully selected to train to become a future leader to fight the \\"buggers\\", a violent alien invader, after beating up his school bully. I think Card does a fabulous job of bringing up all kinds of themes throughout the writing. I enjoyed the extremity of competition, the different kinds of friendship displayed, and his demonstration of how very differently youth think than adults. My favorite theme challenged an idea that Ender encountered early on in Battle School: Winning is more important over than anything. Even though this is definitely not a fairytale, Ender's Game addresses real issues of strained family relationships and obstacles to building trust, which makes me comfortable recommending this book to a large audience. This book may be a little harsh for children to read due to the violence and language.

0307477479|5.0|Music makes the world go around and music makes A Visit from the Goon Squad spin and pulse like an electric guitar.  This Pulitzer Prize winning novel is a canon where each character has a individual story that connects to the orchestra which is the Goon Squad.<br /><br />Bennie and Sasha are the main characters whose past, present and future story lines exist throughout the entire book.  Bennie was in a band when he was in high school.  He grew up to be a record executive with a beautiful, intriguing secretary named Sasha.  Sasha likes to steal things and has a troubled past that she doesn't want anyone to know about.  New characters are continually introduced, whose lives intersect with Bennie and Sasha.<br /><br />Each chapter is a mystery where you must uncover who the narrator is and how they connect to the lives of Sasha and Benny, who literally run the show.  The technical business of music is combined with the way Egan wrote this book.  A Visit from the Goon Squad is unique, intellectual, technical and full of heart.  The underlying theme of music gives the book a heartbeat.  There is an entire chapter written in Power Point format and makes you wonder about pauses.<br /><br />A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book full of characters you will love to hate and may even care about in the end.  This is a book to think on and analyze.  (I love books that make me think and analyze!)  I loved the mystery of the Goon Squad and the pieces of the chapters that make you form your own unique puzzle.  It is fun to think about why this book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2011.  Is it the goons, the music, the unique writing?  Hmmm.<br /><br />The goons are chasing all of us so... Where is the goon in your life?
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best electronic solitare games I have ever played. I love how you just have to click the card to get it to go where you want it and when you are pretty much finished, instead of making you click on each card it finishes the game for you.

159448385X|5.0|Once you start this book don't plan on putting it down. Kaheld Housseini is one of my favorite writers. He manages to incorporate all aspect of a good novel into one book. His style of writing isn't just for one type of person. If you have read any of his other books, The Kite Runner for example, you know that he addresses issues on every level. I was skeptical prior to reading A Thousand Splendid Suns because I didn't think it would be as good or even better than The Kite Runner. I was surely wrong; this book is now one of my all time favorites. Housseini will capture you as a reader. He writes with every emotion. You will become the characters.<br />One of my favorite things about this book is his use of melancholy. He splits the book into three parts. The first two parts are the stories of two different women and the last part is where the stories morph into one. He does a fantastic job of this. Probably the best I have read.<br />I highly suggest this book for a phenomenal read. It will take you on a ride of emotions as Housseini addresses politics, social class, religion, sexual roles, love, and heartbreak.

B000UR9QIK|5.0|George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is an unlikely masterpiece.  It had a very modest budget and only a couple months to complete.  Since they filmed in a real mall, they could only shoot late at night; making it tough for all personnel.  If that isn't bad enough, there wasn't enough money for any big name actors or actresses.  With so many odds against it, somehow the film found a path to success.  Word-of-mouth clearly had a lot of impact, because the film finally quenched horror fans thirst for gore. The prior success of Night of the Living Dead also had an affect on the success of Dawn of the Dead.  The film works well in many genres and it has a great script.  Dawn of the Dead is a spellbinding masterpiece that visually shows the labor of love and all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the film..<br /><br />Multiple genres used in the film creates a broader fan base.  Dawn of the Dead uses horror and fantasy as a foundation.  Essentially, zombies are very eerie.  Unlike vampires, zombies have a very authentic notion to them.  The fact that they contain no ridiculous characteristics, fabricates a rational fear.  In essence, George A. Romero invented the \\"flesh eating\\" zombie (inspired by I Am Legend), which is a scarier idea than the typical mind controlled-voodoo zombies in earlier films.  Dawn of the Dead is brilliant because it uses themes of science and religious conviction as devices of horror.  It's never confirmed whether if it's a virus like in Resident Evil, or if it's the end times suggested by a character in the film named Peter, who said \\"When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\"  Behind the dreadfulness, a luxurious fantasy is at hand.  Once you let go of the idea that zombies look like people, the film fabricates a fun proposal; survive by any means necessary.  It provides a fantasy that people can actually use guns to survive, as opposed to plainly murder in cold blood.  In the film, a bunch of rednecks and military soldiers use the scenario as a zombie hunting game, but the main characters find a fantasy of their own.  Imagine going to the mall and getting everything for free. Is it worth risking your life fighting through the hordes of zombies?<br /><br />The film has a really smart script. All the characters are relatable and dynamic. Stephen is a soldier.  He has a quick wit, bubbly personality, and gets along with everybody.  At the beginning of the film he's very rational, but when he gets too comfortable with the situation, that's when he takes a dynamic change for the worst.  His foolish actions got him bitten; eventually he died.  Peter is an African American soldier.  He is even-tempered, reserved, and looked upon as knowing the answers.  He is probably the least dynamic character; however, his friendship with Roger is dynamic.  Francine is the only female among this particular group of survivors.  At the beginning of the film, she's very overlooked; by the end of the film, her importance was vital.  Roger is the most dynamic character, and the most important character.  He's Francine's boyfriend, and Stephen's best friend.  He's also the only one who knows how to navigate a helicopter.  Eventually, he teaches Francine.  As far as him being dynamic; he was perceived as the weakest character.  His change was so gradual, that as an viewer, we realized it after he turned into a zombie.  Unlike George A. Romero's other films in the Dead series, this one had an emotional attachment to the characters.  It's also attention-grabbing that an African American was portrayed as the lead character.  Besides the script containing interesting character, it also contains an interesting plot delivery system.  The characters didn't really have any plans, apart from surviving.  Instead of characters following a certain predictable plot, the plot followed the characters.  That's very effective when it comes to keeping the viewers' interest.<br /><br />It's safe to say that Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero's magnum opus. It's like Apocalypse Now, but in a urban setting and with zombies.  I'm a critic about everything, and there's nothing I say to criticize this film.  With a modest budget, and limited resources, this is the best film is could possibly be.  As far as the zombie genre is concerned, only a few films have inhaled the tour de force \\"aroma\\" of Dawn of the Dead.  Films such as 28 Days Later, Planet Terror and the Dawn of the Dead remake.  But George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, made in 1978, still sets high standards for films in any genre.ad is George A. Romero's magnum opus.

B0012CJQY6|5.0|The Shield lets you know in its very first episode that it is a very different kind of cop show and Vic Mackey is a very different kind of cop.  The pilot is so good Michael Chiklis (Vic) had to take a shower after first screening it.  It only took one episode (episode 9 of this season) for me to be hooked.<br /><br />The Shield is set in the LA and based heavily on the Rampart scandal from the 90s.  It follows a new, experimental station opened in the gang-infested, fictional neighborhood of Farmington.  In a departure from the standard police procedural approach, instead of a single focus the show follows a couple uniformed cops (the weakest portion), the politically ambitious police chief, two homicide detectives, and most of all Vic and his Strike Team.  It takes elements from different shows--Gangs + Law & Order style murder and sex crime investigations + beat cops--and puts them together.  All interact at times, and stories and investigations often span episodes.  There are some ripped-from-the-headlines storylines, but The Shield doesn't go to that well nearly as often as Law & Order<br /><br />The Strike Team is a four-man anti-gang unit operating in essence autonomously under the unquestioned authority of Vic.  They are the sort of cops whose absolute belief in their own superiority to criminals and the righteousness of their mission allows them to pursue justice in a brutally effective manner, all while making a little extra cash on the side.  Some of the things Vic and his team do on The Shield are shocking, but if you've read much about the Rampart scandal, you know what actually happened was just as outrageous.  The real difference is that while the cops involved in the Rampart scandal were under little to no supervision, Vic and his team are under constant pressure from their captain.  But that creates a wonderful inner-conflict for the characters that aren't members of the Strike Team.  They hate Vic, but not as much as they hate the criminals they both fight.  And Vic is too good to ignore.<br /><br />The Shield pushes the envelope for basic cable.  It may not be as violent or feature as much nudity as an HBO drama, but it certainly squeezes as much past the censors as it could have been expected to.  To put it another way, if you showed it to me and told me it was an HBO drama I would not have expressed surprise.  It's shot in a voyeuristic style that gives the show a certain realism.<br /><br />The Shield has a great ensemble cast, but Michael Chiklis as Vic makes the show.<br /><br />DVD extras: Apparently there is commentary on every episode (there is no way I'm watching that many commentary tracks).  Chiklis and showrunner Shawn Ryan provide a parting message after the final episode.  Special features include: Making of \\"The Shield,\\" \\"The Shield\\" FX featurette, the pilot script, casting tapes (for Michael Chiklis, Catherine Dent, Walton Goggins, Michael Jace, Kenneth Johnson, Jay Karnes, Benito Martinez, and CCH Pounder), and 17 deleted scenes.

B003EYVXSW|2.0|But what I got was pure crap.<br /><br />Splice is about a relationship-stupid couple who were played by the great Adrien Brody and the incredibly annoying Sarah Polley. They're both brilliant genetic researchers who were on the break of fame for creating two genetically spliced creatures named Ginger and Fred that were the products of DNA from a multitude of organisms. What a fricken great idea; an idea that is explored in many great novels, movies, videogames, etc., and the idea in Splice falls extremely short of great. Well, to complicate the story, Sarah Polley injects human DNA into the same sort of organic base that Fred and Ginger were created from . . . and of course the organism would turn out to be humanoid . . . At this point there's potential for a great Frankenstein-esque tale . . . But no, it just turns into a sick, demented, bestiality, incest tale with no climax, no imagination, and with no likeable characters.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film as a good science fiction-horror; I can almost recommend this film as a decent softcore-bestiality with a hint of incest at the end. That's not my kind of movie; is it your kind of movie? Maybe.

0451196716|5.0|ON BACHMAN:<br />Stephen King did not write this book, Richard Bachman did. What I mean by this is that Stephen King didn't just throw on a different name and call it good; he actually wrote in such a way that is different that how he writes in almost every way. There elements that remain the same, sure, such as character swearing. But, you gotta remember, up until this point, Stephen King had only released Carrie, 'salem's Lot, The Shining, Night Shift, The Stand . . . and then this book, with no supernatural elements--no wonder he had people fooled (at least from the start of Bachman's career).<br /><br />PREMISE:<br />One hundred kids from around a near future United States volunteer in a walk-a-thon until only one kid stands. If any of the walkers go under four miles per hour, they get warned; if they get warned three times, they get \\"the ticket.\\" What do you think the ticket it? Well, it isn't good. The ticket is what Robert Downey Jr.'s character sold in Tropic Thunder: a bullet. And to the head, of course. The last young boy still walking gets the PRIZE. The premise is as simple as that.<br /><br />ANALOGY OF WAR:<br />Why would young boys volunteer to walk in such a death race that they would likely die? Honestly, I don't know, but Stephen King was trying to make an analogy between the kids volunteering for the Long Walk (for their country) and going the service and going to war (for their country). Of course it is an antiwar message--and maybe Vietnam was the main vein that King drawing his creative juices from, because Vietnam was quite pointless--or so he believes (and so do I).<br /><br />Essentially it draws similarities between how when soldiers first enlist, they're eager and ready to go, ready to take care of business, ready to go in guns a-blazing; or maybe they thought it was just going be an easy walk on the beach and when they were done, their school would be paid for. And then, when they get summoned for war or a battle or their unit gets attacked, they probably had the same feelings that the Long Walkers did . . . why did I volunteer?<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, it's not so thick in this political analogy that it cannot be enjoyed if you don't share the same political point of view, because, in the end, this is a book a entertainment and horror and it's never preachy. But, where it's not trying to be preachy, it cannot help but be a sermon.<br /><br />The sermon is this: why are you doing this potentially deadly thing? Just why . . . that's all it asks.<br /><br />HOW IT COMPARES:<br />I've been recommended the heck out of this book (along with Battle Royale) with the people who've liked The Hunger Games, but a lot of those \\"young people\\" are addicted to the flavor of the month fads and won't take a risk with an older, more established writer, either because he's too popular, or too old. But, as someone who has read The Hunger Games, The Long Walk is the better book because it's better written and it never tries to suck up to the reader and he's not afraid to piss off the reader.<br /><br />And it's because of this: Richard Bachman is not such a nice guy.ed, they probably had the same feelings that the Long Walkers did . . . why did I volunteer?<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, it's not so thick in this political analogy that it cannot be enjoyed if you don't share the same political point of view, because, in the end, this is a book a entertainment and horror and it's never preachy.

B004VF68AQ|5.0|Yes, their classic albums are amazing, but I love this new album very much. It may contain different elements in production, but I love it and think it is fitting. Irresistable Force, End To The Lies, and Curiosity Kills are my top three of the album. Like I said, I love their classic work, but this is new and still has classic Jane's Addiction trademark sound. Highly recommended!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|There was such hype for this book I should have known it was going to be a smash, however I purchased it just to shut everyone up.  I must have read several other books before I finally said ok I'll read it.  The rest of the day I spent every waking moment with my kindle or my iPhone glued to the pages.  I called my daughter and we discussed what I was feeling and her asking me where are you now in the book it was a bonding moment for me and my teen.  It's a amazing journey I'm tempted at 12.07am to purchase the second one but I'll wait get some sleep and be ready to read the second one tomorrow.

B005LAIGW8|1.0|I barely got threw half the film and Ill tell you Idris Elba should go to the bank and return the money they paid him for this role not because he was bad at it but because they convinced him to play the role in this awful film if you can call it that. Wow what a freaking Bomb of a movie the first one was bad but you could at least get through it. I happen to love and respect the directors previous work I think they are very good at what they do but the true curse of this Ghost Rider found its way out once again with a vengeance (no pun intended). I almost felt as if I were set on fire for even trying to give it a viewing and Nicolas Cage love the Cage but Damn brother whats with the run of Bad films whats happening with the choices.(Your slowly loosing public respect for your craft). Try and find the fire within you once again and stay away from Johnny Blaze. I would not recommend watching this movie even to the undead.

B000005HDT|5.0|As far back as the mid 1950's musicians such as Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers became intent on bringing jazz back to the African American community. In their time they by and large succeeded. Blues and gospel eventually began to lead into whole new styles of music such as R&B and soul as the 60's came in. Those in jazz who took to the new musics in some way did very well. Such as those who innovated in the soul jazz movement. By the time the 70's rolled around Donald Byrd was not only still an active musician but also an important music educator at Howard University where he'd soon put together a group known as the Blackbyrds,probably based on the title of this album. Recorded in 1972 but released the following year this recording found Byrd under the realization of the changes in the broader taste of the African American public by this point. Especially those bought on by the advent of Motown. This began his association with the Mizell brothers Fonce and Larry along with members of The Crusader-all of whom had played and written for different Motown acts. In particular The Jackson 5. So that influence was important to what happened here.<br /><br />  Now this album is not merely some heavy polyrhythmic jazz-funk exercise. This music is heavily based in pop/R&B. That means that melody,verses and choruses are a huge part this music almost more so than jazz soloing. The first two songs are in the the eight minute range. But with the advent of cinematic soul that had value too. \\"Flight Time\\" continues to build throughout the song never really arriving at anything. But that's the whole point. It stays on this terrific major key melody from beginning to end. The title song has a heftier groove with the use of moog synthesizer adding much of the weight.  The majority of the songs here such as \\"Love's So Far Away\\",\\"Mr.Thomas\\",\\"Sky High\\" and \\"Where Are We Going\\" actually have a lot more in common with certain types of pop/soul of the time than hardcore jazz-funk. Again melody and breezy grooves with a lot of wah wah and electric piano solos are the order of the day on these tunes. Byrd and the band are back to the heavy funk however on \\"Slop Jar Blues\\". Here the moog comes back into play and Byrd himself does a bit of singing as well. It's one of the heaviest grooves here in terms of funk.<br /><br />  Needless to say this album met with much the same fate as most jazz-funk of the time did critically. Writers of this era have just never seemed to deal with anything outside West Coast cool and be-bop as having any relevance to jazz. Most of the time they simply missed the point of this. But in later years hip-hoppers didn't as many,especially Madlib/Yesterday's New Quintet,found new ways of re-imagining grooves from albums like this after the turn of the millennium. Of course even that being the case,it's important this music be recognized on it's own terms too. It always seemed as if musicians are often a little more ahead of the game in terms of the audience's needs than writers and critics are. Especially black musicians. There's a strong futurist type creative thread running through that cultural pool. That thought process that links the past to the present by way of a possible future. And that might be where the scism between writer and artist exists. All too often a music writer will tend to sentimentalize the past and perceive any unfamiliar musical ideas as threatening and even dangerous to their perception of art. On this album whatever sounds Byrd is making draws the listener right into the music. So on it's creative intention,it's an enormously influential success.y and breezy grooves with a lot of wah wah and electric piano solos are the order of the day on these tunes.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I resisted reading this trilogy simply because I don't usually care for flash-in-the-pan popularity, but hearing all the great things about the books I couldn't resist for long.<br /><br />The low price of only $5 for the Kindle version tipped me to my final decision of finally reading this book.<br /><br />I haven't read a book that I couldn't put down in a very long time. It was invigorating for me to realize that I spent every waking hour reading this book. One night I checked the clock and it said it was 11pm. The next time I brought my head up for air, I checked the clock and it was 2:20AM. The was the fastest, most entertaining 3 1/2 hours of my life. I did it again the next day. In all, it only took me 2 days to read.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is fast-pased, the prose flows well and is very easy to read and understand, the characters have depth and realism; simply put - this book is amazing.<br /><br />Now to the only flaw I could find: Of all the detail in the book, from the mouthwatering descriptions of the food, to the bone-chilling scenes of fear, to the stomach-churning descriptions of wounds there was no mention of anyone having to use the bathroom!<br /><br />Days holed up in a cave holding each other and kissing, eating, and talking but no mention about the characters having to face the torrential rain storm to go to the bathroom was bothersome. I counted many scenes of characters lying in wait but never a scene of someone needing to relieve themselves behind a tree while another stood watch, or a character all alone but having to evacuate their bowels and trying to find a safe place to do it. All the food they ate and water they drank but not one sentence of having to pee. It just seemed very odd for such a detailed book. The author left nothing unexplained in regards to their clothes, food, ideas, fears, love, hate, wounds, death, even detailing one wound as dripping puss so the absence of a natural process such as urinating was hard to overlook halfway through the book.<br /><br />You can tell this one thing really affected me. It was just a very annoying and bothersome omission in an otherwise perfect book.alfway through the book.<br /><br />You can tell this one thing really affected me.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|This is the best album by Nightwish so far, in my opinion. It has a similar sound to 'Once' which is my second favorite. From the haunting quality of songs like 'Slow, Love, Slow' and 'Turn Loose the Mermaids' to the rhythmic songs of 'Ghost River' and 'I Want My Tears Back' and 'Scaretale' you will find yourself drawn into a world of darkness and dreams. The two music only pieces, 'Arabesque' and the title piece 'Imaginarium' are reminiscent of Cirque du Soleil. What I really liked was how they used Scandinavian and Celtic music in their pieces that made me want to do a jig and kick up my heels in a reel. I've listened to the first disc over and over again and while the music only CD is good, I found myself yearning for the words to fill the spaces. But that doesn't mean its bad, just not as good without the words. I look forward to their next CD but if that's not for awhile, then I will happily listen to Imaginarium over and over again.

However, I was very disappointed. I have a laundry list of grievances, but I will stick to the basics.<br /><br />First, the awful writing. I am no literature snob. However, this book feels like it us on a 5th grade level made to seem better with a thesaurus. It's repetitive and just plain bad.<br /><br />Next, the non-existent plot. Seriously, nothing happens. They meet, they have sex, they email each other, the have more sex, the bite lips, they have more sex, the end.  Just plain boring.<br /><br />Last, bad sex. \\"Down There?\\" are you kidding me? It's called a vagina. Grow up. This book most likely intrigues bored housewives and hormonal teenagers. If the author was aiming to give that demographic the tingles she most likely succeeded. However, a book that it 70% sex should at least be good sex.<br /><br />I feel stupid for reading this book and wish I had spent that ten bucks on socks.

0439023491|5.0|This was an excellent follow up to the first Hunger Games book.  I was really afraid that the second book wouldn't feel like it fit with the first, but I was very pleasantly surprised with how well the two meshed together.<br /><br />It was great to see the aftermath of the Hunger Games - I think she did an excellent job of showing how traumatic the Games would be on the victor, as well as the families and communities.  This was particularly true with her portrayal of Haymitch and the long term effects the Games have had on his life.  It was also nice to see Katniss' relationship with Gale get a bit more development than in the first book, especially since he is portrayed as being a second love interest.<br /><br />At one point I was afraid that the book was going to degenerate into almost a repeat of the first book, but it didn't really do that; I thought she did a great job of keeping it fresh and interesting without it being disconnected from the first book.<br /><br />Overall, as with the first book, I felt this was an interesting commentary on human nature - Collins does a good job of showing the \\"animal\\" nature that we all have inside of us but fortunately rarely have to experience.  As with the first book, she makes Katniss' a fierce female character without having her be someone the audience can't like.  Katniss is easy to relate too and even care for, as are many of her other characters.<br /><br />Overall this book was a surprisingly good follow up to the first Hunger Games book, and I am thrilled I continued on with the series.... I cannot wait to see what the third book holds!
B0076NAWWA|5.0|There is always a certain scepsis around groups consisting of members from already known/famous bands and sometimes the sum might be a lot less than the individual parts. But not so with this prog supergroup - in fact they have put out a masterpiece. Combining all the best of the individual participants and adding that undefinable factor of magic and good chemistry.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy is ofc a world class drummer and his interplay with bassist Dave LaRue just downright perfect (they have also played together in the Led Zep tribute Hammer Of The Gods). Neal Morse is a true original - a devoted Christian and a magnificent progrocker both on keys and guitar. Steve Morse has rarely sounded better, he knows how to shred in an intelligent way. While Casey McPherson handles most of the lead vocals.<br /><br />Is this a new Transatlantic? Well, not really since the emphasis here is more on the songwriting, less on long suitelike compositions. Recalling 80s groups like Mr.Mister, Toto or Trevor Rabin era Yes. And actually almost every song is a winner with memorable hooklines, clever lyrics and definitely hit potential. But at the same time the album is full of elegant musical details, odd metres, strange breaks, magnificent soloes. Everything to satisfy the musos and the tech freaks also.<br /><br />Quite a music lovers dream and wonderful an album like this is still being made in 2012!

0439023521|2.0|I know that I am not the target audience for this book, but after all the hoopla, I had to read it.  The teenage angst becomes tiresome and the rebellion theme against all all powerful evil government authority is nothing new-the Star Wars series and Logan's Run being a couple of theatrical versions.  The emperor has no clothes, and this book was all hype and very little substance.
0307594777|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was recommended to me by my nephew well before the whole series became such a hot ticket. I found the beginning of the book very tedious, but he said keep going, it's worth it. WOW, totally worth it! I was frantically seeking the second book minutes after I finished the first one. Confession: I skimmed a lot of the first chapters of Dragon Tattoo where Larsson lays a foundation to understand the complexities of the relationships and the action taking place that what follows.  The business elements didn't excite me all that much, though I can see how the law-suit against the magazine was the trigger that brought all the diverse characters together. The skim was enough to keep me going, though I did have to flip back a couple of times to review some of the earlier parts (but not too much).<br />Lisbeth is at first such a foreign creature, it's almost impossible to relate to her.  The way the author brings her into the story so slowly seems to parallel how one might react upon meeting this gamin little goth - yet as we are exposed to her more and more and see her interpersonal relationships we start to feel something.  Curiosity perhaps, not fondness yet, but you want to know more about her certainly. Neither she nor Bloomqvist are especially sympathetic or particularly \\"likeable\\" characters - they're just human; individuals with all the twisted bits included - and Larsson isn't shy about showing all those bits. How he slowly brings out Lisbeth's history throughout the series is nothing short of brilliant.  By the end of the third book I found myself actually punching my fist in the air, hollering \\"you go, girl!\\" (which my cat found rather disconcerting as there was no one else to see this)<br />I just watched the first movie and, as always, I find the movie sorely lacking in comparison to the book as I am a reader first and foremost. Much of Larsson's action is easily translated to screen, but much of what's going on is motivated by thecomplexity of the relationships. There are so many different sub-plots and so many moral crossroads, the books suck you in and don't ever let go. Morality is a highly flexible concept, and it is approached by each character in their own fashion without judgement - Larsson is very good at simply telling their stories and letting the reader make their own call, while managing to be clear on his own stance on things. In all my reading this stands out as one of the most original, complex and engrossing story I've ever found. I was devastated to learn he had died, as finding an author who can write such depth and insight into characters plus give us a complex plot melding such a variety of story lines is so rare.  This series as a whole is right up in my top 10 with Robin Hobb (Assassin trilogy/Mad Ships trilogy/Fool trilogy), The Stand by Steven King and Presumed Innocent by Scott Turow.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|great comedy horror film,i saw it in the theatre when it came out i was 7 years old and loved the gore many years later i still love this film,ive read some 1 star reviews that said the plot was paper thin? i dont know which movie these guys were watching maybe something with nicholas cage. dawn of the dead is a great 1970s flick sure the make up and blood look corny by todays standards but it gives me that surreal comic book feel,anyone who gave this a one star review must have a strange tate in horror films,the comedy aspect is just as good.

B000W7JWUA|1.0|Settlers of Catan (SoC) is extremely addictive and fun, but it is also the most dangerous game ever created because it will teach your children and teens unrealistic economic theories that will eventually doom this planet.<br /><br />If your children and teens play SoC, they will grow up thinking that when you use a commodity, it simply goes back into the existing reserves. When your children play a game that treats natural resources like iron ore are renewable instead of finite resources, they may grow up into climate change deniers or believe pseudoscience like abiogenic oil. Or even worse, they might grow up into economists and sell politicians and the mainstream media cornucopian theories that have no basis in reality, like \\"decoupling\\" and exponential long-term growth.<br /><br />SoC also encourages competition for the limited resources of Catan instead of cooperation among all of the players. Your children and teens will be taught to steal resources from others, engage in hoarding and monopolistic behavior, and negotiate inequitable trade agreements, instead of trying to make Catan a better place for everyone.<br /><br />If you MUST buy SoC for your children and teens, I suggest playing with an alternative set of rules. In order to more accurately model a closed system with finite resources, remove resource cards from the game as they are used during gameplay. Your children need to learn the consequences of the downward slope of Peak Brick on the transportation infrastructure of Catan while they are still young.

078324228X|4.0|The Hurricane does a great job enthralling the audience with Rubin Carter and his boxing career and causing people to have an emotional connection to Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter's racist and unjust situation (his multiple imprisonments). The movie has twisted many of the facts to turn this history into a Hollywood blockbuster and viewers trying to understand the real Rubin Carter would be misled but the movie itself was thought provoking and in itself great entertainment.<br /><br /> My biggest problem with this film was the way the movie portrayed Rubin Carter compared to what the real Carter was like. The movie understandably changes some details of his life to paints a clear picture of who is wrong, and who is right; the wrong being the white detective and the right being Rubin Carter and his Canadian pals.<br /><br />Some details of his life, which were altered in the movie, were that in the movie, 11-year-old Rubin Carter throws a bottle at a child molester to protect the other kids. But Rubin Carter was in fact 14 years old and had stolen $55 dollars and a watch from a man. Also, Rubin Carter was seen returning from war as a successful soldier but in truth, he was released after 21 months after receiving an \\"Undesirable\\" discharge for being constantly AWOL. Finally, Rubin Carter was seen in the movie sitting confidently in the front seat the night of the murder while in reality, he was either hiding in the back seats or lying down while two other men sat in front.<br /><br /> These detail changes may seem miniscule and I believe they are because even though the movie doesn't truly represent the kind of person Rubin Carter was, his situation and the injustice done upon him were still shown and (I think) portrayed in a way that the viewers could understand and also relate. The movie on its own is a great entertainment but one should take caution if they want to learn about Rubin Carter's life.

B00756GKBA|4.0|For me, the release of a new Madonna album is always a big deal.  I've been a fan all my life, but really started following her career during the 90's.  That era, to me, is my favorite Madonna era.  Albums like Erotica, Bedtime Stories, Ray of Light and Music showed a variety and creativity that few pop artists had.  The 2000's were not particularly kind to Madonna.  American Life was practically ignored despite being a decent (albeit preachy) record.  Confessions on a Dance Floor was a shining bright spot during this time before dropping the bomb that was 2008's atrocious Hard Candy.  That album, while it was somewhat decent as a hip-hop-flavored record, was not very good as a Madonna record.  Madonna seemed forced during that record, and similarly I had to force myself to try and enjoy it.  And while I occasionally put that record on for a spin, it doesn't hold a candle to her other albums.<br /><br />Now it's 2012, and Madonna has unleashed her latest album upon the world.  MDNA has a lot of \\"firsts\\": it's her first album with a new record label, it's her first album of new material since releasing a career-spanning greatest hits album (Celebration), and the first album in a new Madonna decade, so to speak.  In the four years since Hard Candy, lots has happened to Madonna's personal life.  The biggest event is undoubtedly her divorce from ex-husband Guy Ritchie, and that above all else takes center stage here.  After a handful of playful dance numbers, Madonna gets down to the nitty gritty and delivers her most personal album since 1989's Like a Prayer (which, incidentally, was also a divorce record).  Helping her this time around is a number of electronica-infused producers such as Martin Solveig, Benny Benassi and her longtime collaborator William Orbit.  The result is an album that brings Madonna back to that level of brilliance and musical ingenuity that we saw in the 90's.  MDNA is every bit as cutting-edge and musically relevant as you would expect from theQueen of Pop.  And while Madonna curiously released the two weakest songs as singles so far, I can assure you that the rest of the album is miles above \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" and \\"Girl Gone Wild\\".  Now I don't routinely do track-by-track reviews, but if any album requires one, it's this one.<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild - The album opens with a soft prayer similar to the Act of Contrition before blasting into this club-thumper.  Sadly, Benassi's production is as plain as it comes and Madonna's lyrics about as commonplace as they get.  Still a nice dance song, though it's not something that adequately befits Madonna.  Not the worst song, but not the best either.<br /><br />Gang Bang - Now THIS is the Madonna we've been waiting to hear!  Despite the pornographic-sounding title, the song isn't about sex at all.  It's a dark, pulsing revenge fantasy where Madonna envisions killing her lover.  The beat is strong, loud, and never lets up save for a fantastic dubstep breakdown in the middle...all before culminating in a rage-fueled finale.  This is an absolutely stellar track and a real highlight on this album.<br /><br />I'm Addicted - A club-ready love song filled with swirling production that beckons you to the dance floor.  Could be compared to Music's \\"Impressive Instant\\", and is just as memorable.  Love it.<br /><br />Turn Up The Radio - If fans have anything to say about it, this will be the next single.  Elation rules supreme here in this happy and carefree dance track.  This deserves to be played at top volume as you drive your car with the windows down on a clear summer's day!<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin' - This is by far the black sheep of the album.  It doesn't fit in with the rest of the album at all, and as MDNA's first single it might give listeners the wrong idea.  It's a cute, catchy pop song, but lacks the brilliance of the rest of the album.<br /><br />Some Girls - This one could also be a single.  Very distorted vocals with a strong, prominent and heavy dance beat.  Madonna references how \\"other girls\\" can be, but how that's not how she is.<br /><br />Superstar - A tender, upbeat love song.  Simple production underneath simple \\"Oh la la, you're my superstar, oh la la love the way that you are.\\"  It's like an updated version of something you'd hear on the Like a Virgin or True Blue albums.  Madonna absolutely makes it work!<br /><br />I Don't Give A - A hard-hitting confessional and assertive song, this is another highlight.  Madonna half-raps the lyrics as she details a day in her life before Nicki Minaj perfectly complements her.  \\"I tried to be your wife...I tried to become all that you expect of me, and if it was a failure, I don't give a...\\" she sings.<br /><br />I'm a Sinner - This is fun pop ditty that is unquestionably William Orbit-style.  The music is slightly reminiscent of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\".  Retro and playful.<br /><br />Love Spent - Oh my God...this song!  Probably my favorite on the album.  A tender-sounding that mostly laments how Madonna's financial situation hurts her love life.  \\"Love spent, yeah I'm love spent, wondering where the love went,\\" she sings.  The song has a dancey beat for most of it before completely changing for the second half, culminating in a beautiful climax.  Orbit's production here is masterful.<br /><br />Masterpiece - This song, written for her film W./E., is a beautiful ballad reminiscent of her Something to Remember days.  We haven't heard Madonna sound like this for a while, and it's fantastic.<br /><br />Falling Free - My second-favorite song on this album is also its quietest moment.  Madonna's vocals here are indescribably beautiful.  For the first time since Ray of Light, Madonna sings in that tender-yet-full voice we heard in Evita.  The song has soft orchestral arrangements and light piano with an electronica-flavored sound that borders on Celtic.  The song is so beautiful, especially near the end.<br /><br />Beautiful Killer - The first of the bonus discsongs, this song is pure retro.  Sounding like the kind of pop music you would hear in the 70's or early 80's, the song brims with guitar and strings.  I've never heard Madonna do anything like this, and I love it!<br /><br />I F***ed Up - A very personal song that wouldn't sound out of place if it were sung by someone like Alanis Morissette.  Madonna confesses her wrongdoings to a lover (could be Guy Ritchie, could be Jesus Luz).  Very apologetic, and not the norm for her.<br /><br />B-Day Song - *sigh* this is the album's weakest moment.  Madonna and M.I.A. sing a carefree song about having a good birthday.  The lyrics are trite, the music sounds unfinished and the song as a whole sounds like something recorded in 2 seconds.  It may work on some level, but when put in with the rest of MDNA is very forgettable.<br /><br />Best Friend - A very Hard Candy-ish hip-hop song, but unlike the songs on that album this one is also deeply personal.  There's no doubt that Madonna is singing about Guy Ritchie, and lamenting the loss of her \\"best friend\\" in Ritchie.  A strong track.<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin' (Party Rock Remix) - It's just a remix of GMAYL.  Nothing to shout about unless you're fan of LMFAO, who adds their own rap alongside that of Ms. Minaj.<br /><br />All in all, MDNA is a fantastic record.  On the whole, it can't really compare to any other Madonna album, and that is precisely why it wins.  Fresh, electronic soundscapes, pulsing beats, no-holds-barred lyrics...Madonna has never sounded more invigorating.  Even with its moments of weakness, you cannot go wrong with this album!

B000LTAY1U|2.0|Seiko is the parent company of Lorus and often uses Lorus as the test-bed for products.  A number of years ago I got a Lorus Kinetic Sport YT-57, an excellent watch that I have been wearing daily since I bought it.  I lead a pretty active life and, as you can imagine, the crystal is worse for wear.  I was looking for something nearly identical but in better condition for use in more formal settings.<br /><br />Unfortunately this Seiko is not it.  It looks nice and is comfortable, but is cheaply made when compared to its low-end predictor.  The biggest problem is with the weight/gear combination that powers the watch.  Instead of the quiet, smooth action of my other watch, the Seiko makes a moderately loud tinkling sound every time the weight moves.  None of the Seiko parts are made to the same high quality and finish as the Lorus.  Indeed, the parts are made in Malaysia rather than Japan.<br /><br />It is a nice watch, just not up to the quality it should be for the list price and the reputation of the company.

B003Y5H5HO|1.0|If I hadn't read the book first, this movie would have made as much sense as Alice's trip down the rabbit hole.  Characters dart in and out of the action with little context and no explanation of who they are, and the plot is disjointed and confusing.  To make things worse, the audio is horrible and all the actors seem to have perfected the art of mumbling.  I suppose elite \\"filmies\\" will consider these factors to be indicative of a cinema masterpiece.  I consider them a waste of time.

B004EPZ034|4.0|The 411 by Maria, Handsome and Goddess:<br /><br />We were able to watch this on Wednesday which happened to be a day off due to teacher conferences or some jazz. We loved the last chipmunk movie so we had high expectations for this one.  Personally, I wasn't sure that they would be able to carry on the franchise in a way that was interesting and fresh man was I wrong. We sang through the whole movie. It is a really cute story. Goddess was in love with all the music. She has a favorite chipmunk and stated so through the whole movie. Handsome liked anytime Dave and Ian were on screen. He thinks the Chipmunks former manger is hysterical especially in the pelican suit.<br /><br />In Chipwrecked, Dave takes the Chipmunks and the Chippettes on a cruise. Alvin of course ends up getting them all grounded while Dave heads to dinner to talk with the captain. Poor little Theodore ends up watching TV that is way too scary for him. My kids thought it was so cute how he couldn't just change the channel and sat there mesmerized at the creepy images before his eyes. They do the same if they wake in the middle of the night to see us watching something on Sci-Fi.<br /><br />When everyone ends up overboard the chipmunks must work together to survive on an island, and yes, they do sing \\"I'm a survivor\\". The songs are some of the best parts of the movie!<br /><br />If you have chipmunk fans in the house, you can't go wrong with this family friendly movie. Yes, I have seen some reviews were people talk about the \\"suggestive\\" dance moves of the Chippettes but I was watching the same stuff on the Bugs Bunny Show and Tom and Jerry too. Nothing different! I didn't see it as sexy than, and I don't see it as sexy now. Just a good family friendly movie!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I wanted a very slim lightweight case for my new Kindle Fire.  I basically wanted a skin type cover for on the go to protect my kindle when I pop in in my bag.

Some have complained about the story being written in a \\"simple\\" style, but I appreciated the accounts being in his true words that Kyle would use if he were telling you in person. I don't want a bunch of flowery words and perfect grammar when reading a book about a navy seal. The language and grammar that \\"normal people\\" use every day is much more entertaining when hearing war stories than some elite professor would use writing books for his stuffy upper crust types. Chris is a NAVY SEAL! Deal with it. He did a mission that needed to be done. He did what his country asked of him....VERY WELL!

B003VANOFY|1.0|The G930 was used by me in my home office, mainly to conduct Skype conferencing.  I read all the reviews about its capabilities, and since I have a Mac I didn't expect much since the software is only for the PC.  So while the G930 didn't really play well with the Mac, I had no unexpected issues there.  But my main complaint is that after two months the battery won't hold a charge for more than 30 minutes of use.  And even after you plug it in, it can't be used while plugged in to charge.  It's now worthless to me.  I'd not advise purchasing this headset.

B00756GKBA|5.0|The music is an outstanding mix of club rave anthems and evocative moods.  You can't help but groove along.  Crank this up and have an awesome sound system to boot.<br /><br />\\"Hard Candy\\" kept her hidden whereas \\"MDNA\\" shows her true self and will push you to smile, dance or work out without ever stopping.  \\"Ray of Light\\" showed the birth of her daughter and \\"MDNA\\" displays the death of her relationship, but also a more profound Madonna.<br /><br />MDNA starts off with the heavier club trance stuff.  Ignore the released tracks \\"Gimme All Your Luvin\\" and \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" as those are oddly some of the weakest tracks on this album and should never have been recorded.  There are 10 great track on this album.  The rest are throwaways, but to have 10 great tracks on a CD nowadays is a rare feat.  So this gets 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Gang Bang\\" is a song inspired by Quentin Tarantino flicks that tend to feature strong female leads as the warrior.  The music is almost a Nine Inch Nails homage that you hardly recognize it's Madonna.<br /><br />There are some powerful tunes that allude to the break up of her marriage like \\"Love Spent\\" which even incorporates some brilliant Banjo playing.  It's the best song on the album.  Her anger and honest feelings are cracked open on this uptempo rock dance song.<br /><br />She also raises her middle finger to all those that continue to spread hate wanting her to just die and go away on \\"I Don't Give A\\".  The song is a powerful anthem about following your dreams and living fast and enjoying each minute while ignoring the insects and parasites of society crawling around.  They're totally insignificant and she shouts that with great fervor.

There are a few famous cameos - frankly I was surprised there were not more.<br /><br />All the Muppets you know and love are here - I enjoyed 80s Robot more than I should admit.<br /><br />The story hits every required recycled plot point  - you can see it all coming a mile off and yet, this only makes the movie better. \\"The Muppets\\" breaks the fourth wall a few times, but doesn't abuse it and the wink to the audience works well.<br /><br />The music is fun, although how \\"Man or Muppet\\" won an Oscar is beyond me...it's not even the best song in the movie.<br /><br /> \\"The Muppets\\" isn't perfect, but it's an entertaining movie made with love and is well worth the purchase.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|It's hard to believe that Rooney Mara who seemed like just another bland teen actress in the \\"New Nightmare on Elm Street\\" is the same one who rips the screen apart in this movie.  She was incredible adds a loud dynamic to a story that is bathed in a moody grey atmosphere.  This is a thriller with great suspense almost like an Agatha Christie novel.  There are two scenes that are difficult to watch and they happen in the first 45 mins, but other than that this is a straight forward mystery.  Daniel Craig is a journalist who is asked to write a book, but uncovers much more that involves possible murder.  He calls upon the Rooney Mara character who is one of the best research investigators, but considered unusual and anti-social.
B004EWFUQY|3.0|This diet is good and you do not get hungry.  It however, works very slowly.  It keeps the weight off.  I did not loose the estimated 10/12lbs after the specified period, but it took 6 weeks to reach 10lbs.  It is one of the nicer diets out there.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|There have been several movies lately that seemed to revolve around the friends with benefits theme.  It observes typical relationships today which seem to be more of the friends with benefits set up.  This is generally because the two involved are either commitment shy or simply want to avoid any complications that could ruin their friendship like emotion.  Oh, but emotion inevitably shows up and rears its ugly head.  This movie examines all this in a fun, light and entertaining way.  Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have great chemistry as friends and you soon believe and can see them together as a romantic couple.  There is quite a bit of nudity and sex so this is not for those who are easily offended by movies that harp on sex issues as this one harps on it in abundance.  Overall for this genre it exceeded my expectations and did its job of entertaining.  Plus how many of us have been there?
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner<br /><br />First Impressions: I heard so many great things about this book, read the first chapter online and was hooked. I knew I was in for something new and refreshing. I was right too.<br /><br />First 50-100 Pages: This plot and this new take on the supernatural world is thoroughly intriguing. I am so very impressed with the research that Rebecca has spun into this novel. Not only in terms of plot and setting, but also genre. This is not YA but it's not adult either. It's finally a book for someone my age. (21) Oh, and can I just say, I would love to go to Club Flesh. I'm not much of a clubber, but I'd go there in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Characters: Sophia is 22 years old. So refreshing from the brunette 17 year olds that I have been reading. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it just gets old. But here, Sophia is a Wiccan (I love studying Wicca. I find it fascinating.) who gets swept up into the supernatural world. I really loved this idea of the `forever girl' and thought that Rebecca did a wonderful job showcasing this with Sophia.<br /><br />Charles is a dual-breed, which I think is an awesomely cool concept. Part vamp, part shifter. I really enjoyed this little mix of supernaturals. My only wish for Charles would have been to see more of his `oldness' and more...something. Just, I wanted more. Hopefully in the next book, I will get that<br /><br />And when it comes to Sophia and Charles' relationship, I loved it! It was incredibly awkward for Sophia at times, embarrassing, and everything that a real romance is. There is no such thing as insta-love and I loved seeing their relationship transform. There were quite a few heated scenes that for sure made me realize that this is for people at least twenty.<br /><br />Ivory and Lauren, Sophia's best friends, were really interesting. Ivory's plot line actually broke my heart. I felt terrible for her. And Lauren, I hope there is more of in the next book.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: If there are any twenty something year olds out there looking for more than just YA, read this book. As much as I love me some YA, it was thoroughly enjoyable to read something a little more mature.
0439023513|1.0|-Spoiler Alert- Don't read this. I loved the first two books. This book left me sad and feeling angry that I spent so much time reading the trilogy. Characters that we came to love, especially Katniss, became shells of human beings and the ending makes you feel like it's all for nothing. Read the first two and make up your own ending, this book ruins it.

0062082353|3.0|I got this book looking for a good account of one of the best snipers. But all you hear is bragging and druken bar fights. With all do respect these men are good at what they do and god bless them for it, but just think about what you say before you say it. A good read but not 5 star good.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|These wireless headphones are a great value for 7.1 surround. Can take optical signal from pretty much everything.  Sounds is good and bass boost helps when activated.<br /><br />Headphones are comfortable and felt great on longer wearing sessions.<br /><br />Chat boost works well, but if you have the volume turned up, you won't always hear your own voice.<br /><br />A few cons though, clicking can be heard if near a wireless router.  Clicking was more obvious when using a wireless connection from a Wii in the other room.<br /><br />Another con was that the optical cable included in the package didn't connect to my optical outputs or the base, therefor  digital input \\"pass thru\\" was useless.  Emailed Turtle Beach and explained my problem.  Said they'd send out a new cable, but I never got it.<br /><br />Other than that, I have 4 rechargeable AAA batteries:<br />[[ASIN:B003SP4QAE Energizer CHP4WB4 Recharge Smart AA/AAA Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteries]]<br /><br />This works well when you don't want to buy new batteries.  Got an extra AAA 4-pack and headphones are always powered.<br /><br />I've had this set for a while now and still works great for my home theater.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Awesome, wonderful, terrific,  only has one flaw. The Bible part is the only part I can access. The rest is inaccessible. Fair game, without talking to me like I am stupid, is there a way to access the rest? Just asking.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|A huge 'thank you' to everyone who made this movie.  This movie captures the joy that is The Muppets.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This movies is so outstanding, it should have been nominated for Best Picture!  Yet it was not even nominated. The Academy only chose to nominate 9 movies this year instead of the typical 10, making it painfully obvious this one was the black sheep.  It did, however, win for best editing....an honor that typically goes to about a third of best picture winners!  Mara Rooney, direction, editing, screenplay and cinematography were all outstanding and make this one of the best pictures of 2011.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|The book's main point is just the basics of the science of behavior modification. According to the book habits are behavior that are routines that are cued by a stimulus and controlled by rewards. So, a cue triggers a routine that is rewarded. The behaviorists call the \\"cue\\" the antecedent, the \\"routine\\", the behavior and the \\"reward\\" the consequence, or ABC, Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence.<br /><br />The book tells interesting stories about the application of the ABC's of behavior modification in regard to various personal and cultural behaviors. The book is a veiled introduction to behaviorism and behavior modification. However, the book does not credit B. F. Skinner, the founder of the science of behavior at all or behaviorism or behavior modification science; therefore, my rating is 2 stars. How can the author write about behavior and be so ignorant of Skinner and behavior science? You can learn much more than this book has to offer if you want to really learn about habits (behavior) by reading the works of B. F. Skinner, Paul Chance and others behaviorists.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|thank you for everyone telling me not to get the update I think this is great to pass time but keep track of time so toy are not late<br />:)
1594630844|5.0|This is a warm, comfortable and comforting, interesting book. Maybe I say that because I am in the age range of Pillemer's study group but I think it's more that it makes sense, that it represents my own thinking and expresses it elegantly. It's like having a wonderful meat and potatoes meal rather than a light salad - tasty, filling, nourishing and satisfying.<br /><br />My initial thought on being asked to read the book was \\"How boring will this be? Like watching paint dry?\\"  Mark me down as absolutely wrong. There was nothing boring about this book and I found that I picked it up every chance I had so I could  get another tasty bite or two. And there were places that I simply couldn't put it down and lingered with it much longer than I had planned.<br /><br />I found myself shaking my head yes in agreement a lot and often saying to myself, \\"Oh, why didn't I think of that?\\" There was very little that I didn't savor or agree with as I read. It was like reading about a group of dear old friends whose wisdom I cherished and whose words I could count on.<br /><br />Pillemer writes with warmth, respect and love about those he interviewed and his style invites you to stay awhile and enjoy  the memories, the charm and the honesty of these new friends. He helps you share the joy as well as the sadness as they tell their stories and you marvel at the strength of character revealed in their words and actions. He leaves you with admiration for those who willingly shared some of their most intimate thoughts with such transparency.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for some - couples who are planning to get married, those seeking their first job,  and first-time parents, to name a few. I wish everyone could read the chapter, \\"Choose Happiness\\" - it could make such a difference in the quality of life for so many.  And young people just starting out with new jobs and new families should memorize the advise about worry and taking it one day at a time - living in themoment.<br /><br />I loved this book. And I recommend it to anyone who likes to read material that is honest, enjoyable and uplifting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's a fun game thats equally challenging and fun I highly recommend this app plus it's free so what's stooping you from buying it now
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is maniacally brilliant and infectious! Grammys headed her way in FEB 2013 without a doubt. I can't stop listening to \\"Love Spent\\"... Get out of your funk and into the virulent groove of MDNA.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was amazing. You don't have to be obsessed with zombies to become hypnotized by Max Brooks' writing. From the beginning, I was drawn in...the characters became so real...they had such personality. Everything was so well thought out; so plausible. The book ended and I wanted more! I wish I was good at writing reviews--I can't adequately express how enthralled I was with this piece...then again, I guess that's why he's an author and I'm not.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007BVOF8E|1.0|There was some potential for sure but I just couldn't stay interested. Like the other reviewers said...soooo boring and painfully slow. I'm glad I wasn't the only one - I started to think maybe I just wasn't 'getting it'. With Gary Oldman in there, I was really hoping for something along the lines of 'The Contender' - which I highly recommend and has tremendous replay value. I think I've seen The Contend at least six times.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd pass on this... IMHO
B003YK42LQ|4.0|The cd rocks--really connected this past weekend involving a long drive from Califonria desert to California ocean--I finally 'understood' this group and their music--really like the diversity of material; the dual guitar work is very clean with a hint of U2 in it, but with a more country feel. Also I like the lead vocalist--passionate with a nice nuanced range. Tight group--guitar work is superb, APPRECIATE their melodic efforts. Theo says \\"yes!\\". I will explore further...
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I work at a camera store, and even with an employee discount our cheapest bags couldn't beat the price. The ones that came close were either shoulder bags or the one strap \\"sling\\" bags that are half the size. This is exactly what I needed, and even though is seemed a bit smaller in person, there was more than enough room for an SLR, 2 lenses, an external flash, a Garry Fong diffuser, a small tripod, a reflector, and all of my other accessories. The velcro dividers work great, and I had no trouble creating a compartment for each item that fits like a glove. I'll be back if there are any complaints, but so far a 5 star purchase!<br /><br />Edit: 5 months later, still loving it! :)

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am relatively new to Angry birds but I like Rio, its a lot of fun to play. Great way to pass the time.
B000001F45|2.0|I've tried quite a few times with this one.  \\"Dated\\" seems like the wrong word to use, considering this IS a recording from the early 70's.  However, it does sound dated in a bad way.  Bad lyrics, corny vocal techniques, and too much organ make this sound like a parody.  I didn't know that Uriah Heep was the inspiration for Spinal Tap until today when I read these reviews.  However, I had already come to this conclusion on my own.  Most of this album really does sound like Spinal Tap without the humor.<br /><br />There are only two tracks here that I find listenable.  \\"Blind Eye\\" is OK and \\"Tales\\" is actually great with it's pedal steel guitar and vocal restraint.  I'm giving this two stars simply because of \\"Tales\\".<br /><br />What I'm really surprised by is the praise that other reviewers have laid upon \\"Sweet Lorraine\\".  It's a very straightforward and repetitive song that doesn't serve any purpose other than to show that this band is capable of sounding generic, as well as campy/corny/cheesy.
B006XF5BTG|3.0|Didn't find anything new in this book, but it is a good summary of the basic information you will easily find elsewhere.
0439023521|5.0|This book was sooooo interesting, and lived up to all the expectations told to me. The shipping was fast and I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy=-D
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy user interface and attractive.  In the thee weeks I've been using this app, it has not crashed or locked up yet.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|It is too small and flimsy to support the size and weight of an iPad in a dock.  Even out of dock, does not pass power through to New 2012 iPad (defective)?<br />Seems more suited for iPhone or iPad touch.  Even their marketing video on Youtube only shows an iPhone in a dock.<br />I don't know why iPad use is suggested in the description on Amazon.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|my son and I beat this game in two days. I sure hope the other levels open soon. worth 2.99. no adds, the birds r cool and the game is excellent!
0765326353|5.0|First, the negatives.  Yes, even though I rated this book 5 stars, there are some - in my opinion.  Sanderson does repeat himself an awful lot.  Characters think the same thoughts over and over, chapter after chapter.  Past events are alluded to frequently.  Now, from my point of view and style of reading, this actually isn't a bad thing.  It takes me a long time to read a book, and I often am reading multiple books concurrently so that I usually read a couple of chapters of any given book during a day.  It's taken me over a month to read \\"The Way of Kings\\".  If I had read it more swiftly, being constantly reminded of things would annoy me more.  Sanderson HAS gotten better, and his repetition of material seems to be more organic to the thought process of the characters.  And let's be honest, it's realistic that characters would think the same thoughts - I know that there are certain events and thoughts that I reflect on each and every day.<br /><br />A second negative is that the book feels a touch disjointed in how it presents the world.  There are at least two distinct forms of Magic presented, possibly three.  Most of the world presented is rather fantastic - 'spren' which appear when certain emotions/sensations/physical events occur: fearspren when someone's afraid, honorspren when people win a great victory, windspren which show up when there's wind, rotspren at the site of a wound, etc... Most people can't see them, and it's not very clear what purpose they serve.  Knowing Sanderson, it will be revealed, but they feel like something of a distraction.  What's odd is that there's at least one chapter where it's obvious that part of the world doesn't have these beings, and is very different physically and biologically (plants act differently).  Right now, there's no reason why this is so.<br /><br />Those two negatives do not in any way bring down my rating of 5 stars.  For such a huge book, it didn't drag much.  The chapters were relatively short, and there were four main points of view with some interludes.  A couple of the interludes did seem somewhat pointless to me but perhaps will become more important in future books.  Unlike most books with different points of view, I found that I was interested in all of them to the same extent.  Each character went through quite a few moments of change in their lives, and Sanderson did a great job at fleshing out their past so that the reader knows why those characters are who they are.  Kaladin is easily the most fleshed out, a former spearman who once thought he would be a healer instead, and through most of the book is a slave in an army.  Someone else mentioned that the flashbacks seemed mere filler, as the reader could guess what happened to him well before it was revealed.  True enough, at least in one case.  But that didn't take away from their impact.  Knowing that something horrible happened, and even guessing what it might be, but getting only snippets at a time throughout the book, keeps a certain level of dread each time one of the flashbacks occurs.<br /><br />Sanderson's world building is very good.  Yes, there were a couple of apparent missteps as mentioned above, but they may be explained later.  One of the things I really liked was his treatment of men and women.  Women particularly have felt 'off' in some of his previous works.  In Elantris, the heroine felt far too modern for the society she was in.  In Mistborn, the heroine felt a bit too stereotyped.  Here, women are strong characters but there's a very good societal reason for it.  They're literate.  Men aren't.  They take down the messages, keep the histories, read books to men, etc.  It's strange, but somewhat believable as a separation of 'accepted' activities between the sexes.<br /><br />Sanderson's writing is 'transparent'.  I know it's repeated a lot, but it's simple and straightforward.  Not everyone likes this, and there are some books I much prefer a more 'literary' style.  I loved Daniel Abraham'sLong Price Quartet.  His writing style there was wordy, well constructed, and quite descriptive.  The books were also ~400 pages long, 1/3 of the size of this book.  Someone else compared two writing styles, suggesting that the more descriptive kind is more fun to read.  He even showed some helpful stats, where each sentence of a writer he considered much better was 2 1/2 times as long.  That would have made The Way of Kings 3000 pages long.  No thanks.  And the simple prose made the revelations spectacular.<br /><br />Ah yes, the revelations.  For anyone who read the Mistborn series the whole way through, you know that Sanderson did something very special.  There were certainly flaws - and bigger ones than in this book.  But the brief italicized passages at the beginning of each chapter were significant although the reader didn't find out the true significance until much later in each novel.  He also had a nice one involving an earring in which I literally said \\"Oh my god...\\" He repeats the same 'trope' here with italicized pieces before each chapter starts.  It won't give much away, they're basically 'last words' of people as they're dying.  The odd bit is the manner in which they're \\"recorded\\", with a notation like \\"9 Seconds before death.  Subject was a lighteyed woman.  Sample of particular note.\\"  I hope it won't spoil anyone's enjoyment to know that it's revealed what these actually are.  And I don't recall ever being stunned by a revelation like I was in this novel.  I actually had to pause when I realized what I was reading and regather myself before continuing on.  And that was just one of the 'reveals' that occurred.<br /><br />I could go on... Basically, this is the book I've been hoping Sanderson would write as he's shown immense creativity both in world building and in craft as a writer, in previous works.  He's not fancy, but the way he WEAVES a story, well, he does things I haven't seen done before.  It worries me that this is a ten volume (planned)series.  I'm not sure he can sustain this level of writing where others have failed.  But for now, this is certainly a fantastic start.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some can be a little bit hard but overalls really fun. make sure you read the description before you play.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Pretty pictures but absolutely no back story.  The tasks you are sent on make no sense.  Please don't think this will be anything close to Myst or Riven.  I LOVED those games.  The Lost City may be kind of fun for a very light Android/Kindle app, but there is no story other than the intro.  It's worth a buck, but no more.  I would pay good money for a game as good as Myst or Riven.<br />YMMV.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Since when are movies like these comedies??! Like 50/50 or crazy, stupid love, etc... I laughed not at all.<br />Luckily I know within 10min. whether to watch all the way through or not.<br />And since when is 37 a Young Adult?  Last time I checked its on the highway<br />to Middleage-ville yes? I had hopes of this being reasonably funny like<br />Bridesmaids or Bad Teacher. But they were dashed like waves against a rocky shore.
B0031RS64G|4.0|Yes it Was very difficult to get into, but once in I didnt want to get out so now Im on book 6 of 10 called bone hunters and still loving this series<br /><br /> I would call this Dark Adult fantacy for serious fantasy lovers<br /><br /> Children and young adults will not like this<br /><br /> In my opinion it was a good start to a great long series, thats not your typical good vs clear-cut evil, but shows how just as in our world; what is evil is most often dependant on the point of view of the beholder; just like beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so it is with good and evil with a few exceptions ofcourse<br /><br />This huge epic complex world he created can easily be used for many more books with different characters that doesnt have to be anything about the malazan empire at all; as he proved with \\"Midnight Tides\\"<br /><br />Its not an easy read per say but still much easier than the lord of the rings for example. So a book doesnt have to be an easy read to be fantastic.<br /><br />Easy reads are for children and teens I say<br /><br />Would really have liked to see more of Tattersail though; I loved her; but so far she only featured in 2 of the 6 books
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I thought this would be a really fun game but evidently it is for children. It doesn't seem to have a purpose - but the price was right.

0553582038|3.0|Im trying to finish the last 80 pges so i can be finished with this book.  Im sorry that im not sorry that  this book was not fun to read.  It was boring and stagnant.  Sansa's last chapter had me wanting to shoot myself, nothing happens!  First three books were fun and fast paced, had great intriguing characters, but then you killed them all.  No chapters with tyron? Wtf!  Next book needs to jump a few years.  I hear the next book is also boring.  Awesome.....
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this dvd a week ago and I have noticed a difference right away.  I have been on (and off) atkins for the past 5 or so months and have been able to lose about 35 pounds.  I walk as much as I can, and have done zumba and yoga at home.  This video though is what is going to make a difference.  you will be sore the 1st few days, but by day 5 if done right and completed every day you will see and feel a difference.  I have lost 2 inches total in a week.  No weight loss really, but my clothes already feel better, I am stronger and am able to do the exercises easier.  I started level 2 today and love that it feels so different from level 1 but just as hard.  I have a bad left knee, so I take it a little easy during squats but have had less pain since starting this video.  definitely worth buying and doing, I believe I will drop a pants size by the end of the 30 days.  she is a bit annoying though, she talks through most of it.

B002N7P23I|2.0|The dub is simply awful. I tried to watch for about three minutes but the voices were so out of sync and badly matched with the characters I couldn't do it. I just purchased it and feel like I wasted 3 dollars. I'm actually going to rent the spanish version and have no idea what is going on, rather than trying to listen to this terrible voice-over.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Please note that I purchase this control from Amazon themselves and not a third party. This control was easy to connect to my ps3. It felt a bit awkward at first, but then it felt normal. It works great and at a good price with no tax.
0545265355|5.0|I was estatic to find these books at a great price!@ I was happy to read them twice before the movie came out. The books are in beautiful condition and were made perfectly. The book cover is nice as well. I could not say enough how wonderful this product is.
B007HNG2OG|5.0|I'd been on the fence about watching this series, but once I started the first episode, I was hooked... I watched the entire season in two nights. Strong characters, interesting story that builds over time, some sword and sorcery, it's all there. The characters and story are among the best ever to grace the small screen. Stock the refrigerator and order in... once the first episode gets its hooks in you, you won't be able to stop.<br /><br />Take my advice and save yourself a few bucks: Just buy the entire season; buy them separately and you won't be able to wait the entire minute it takes to buy the next episode.

But, recently, I started reading books by Dan Brown, John Grisham, and other notable fiction writers.<br /><br />\\"Deception Point\\" is a well thought-out book that is full of thrill and suspense.  There is a lot of details that gives a perspective on our NASA program- whether we agree with it or not.  I enjoyed how the chapters are rather brief yet entertaining.

B00756GKBA|2.0|I am wondering if Madonna has people around her with enough courage to tell her when she sucks!?!  I don't know what new kind of hell this is but her new CD, MDNA, should have come with a return label for a refund. At this stage of her career, her life-her music should be phenomenal. Instead, it sounds like she typed a few words into some music writing software and out came the 12 tracks that make up the abomination that is MDNA.  The only track that has any evidence of work or talent is Masterpiece.  The rest of the the CD is filler.  Sadly, filler!
0345529057|2.0|I suppose I'm a prude, but I was shocked at how smutty this book does.  What is this guy's thing about nipples?  Wow.  I can tolerate some nastiness -- after all, you need something evil for good to over come -- but this is way over the top.<br /><br />The rape and sodomy and incest and violence and over all horribleness was too much for me.  I finally quit reading halfway through the second book.  It was hard to stop reading because the book is well written and fairly well paced considering the multiple storylines.  It's just to dirty for me.

B002VWNID6|1.0|I recently purchased not once, but twice, the classic movie \\"Robin Hood ,Prince of thieves\\" with Kevin Cosner. The first time we watched the movie it stopped right in the middle, leaving us hanging....so I returned the movie and ordered another one. I thought \\"what are the chances of this happening again?\\" well......it did! The movie stopped in the exact spot the second time around. We were left feeling quite frustrated and confused as to what kind of movies Amazon deals with? I will not be purchasing movies from them anymore. The movie was on cable this week....we taped it!

B007MLDC2I|1.0|I started watching the movie last night, however the movie was really long so I stopped it mid way. I was about to watch the rest of the movie and lo and behold the movie is not in my video library. Now I don't know what the policy for being able to watch a movie but I am not about to re-order a movie for 5 bucks, that is not even as good as the original just so I can finish it. Now normally I get a movie for 48 hours, if 24 hours is the time that Amazon has determined to allow me to watch a movie then I'll just wait and watch the movie for free on Netflix, at least I don't have to quit my job so I can get home and watch a movie. Big Thumbs Down to Amazon.<br /><br />I still would like to see the rest of the stupid movie I paid for.
0307592731|5.0|This book by Cheryl Strayed has moved me more than any book in many years. There were so many aspects of this story which struck a chord (or a nerve) in me that I lost count as I was reading it. I am very different from the author (to start with, I've got an X & Y), but I am so similar too. I decided 40 years ago that I would one day hike the PCT. 40 years later I have never done so. But I will.<br /><br />Thank you Cheryl for being the most honest author I have read.

B004N622EY|5.0|The Final Empire:<br />As said on Wikipedia - \\"The series primarily takes place in a region called the Final Empire on a world called Scadrial. One thousand years before the story begins the king of the Final Empire, the Lord Ruler, gained access to a divine power at what is called `The Well of Ascension.' With this power he remade the world and everything in it into its state at the beginning of the first book. In the Final Empire a Dominance is a territory within the Lord Ruler's empire.\\"<br /><br />Wiki sums it up nicely as to how the book starts. One thousand years ago, there was an event that took place for the Lord Ruler to defeat \\"the deepness\\".<br /><br />A prophecy that was foretold a long time ago, states that there would be a hero, who would be the ultimate selfless being. This hero would enter the well of ascension, and take up the divine power of a god. And in order to defeat this deepness, the hero would have to let go of this power and not keep or use it.<br /><br />This is obviously what made the Lord Ruler a god and religious figure to his people. Because obviously, the prophecy failed. This sets up a great start to this series, because it creates a \\"what if the bad guy wins\\" scenario, what would the world look like? And I can tell you, pretty damn depressing. Mists started covering the earth to an extend that the plants would not have grown. The Lord Ruler used his divine power to move the earth closer to the sun. This helped with the mists but could not stop them. The planet being closer to the sun would be very problematic because it would be too hot. So he created ash mounts to continuously shoot ash into the atmosphere to block the rays of the sun. The plants suffered greatly from this, so he changed the chemical makeup of plants to survive in this sun, this created brown plants and they were not as nutritional as normal plants. So he changed humans to adapt to these surroundings.<br /><br />So effectively, he actually tried making it better, and ended making it worse. A bleak world covered in ash, a red sun, brown plants. You get the idea.<br /><br />So 1000 years after all this took place, the Lord Ruler is still around, being immortal etc. We meet Vin. A girl who grew up on the street. Thieving to survive. Vin and her brother Reen joined thieving crew after thieving crew to make their living. Reen taught her that everyone will betray you if they get half a chance. And in order to prove his point, he deserts her, leaving her to pay off his debt to the current thieving crew. Hard life for a young girl to live in, especially if she is Skaa (Slave race)<br /><br />This is where she meets Kelsier. A man who has great plans (And more than usually, fails at them). Plans to overthrow the Lord Rulers empire and set up a brand new regime.<br /><br />This is a fantasy novel, that works with abilities that people get from metals. There are a bunch of metals and each and every one has a different purpose. This I might add, would have been great if this was hinted before the first chapter saying \\"Kelsier burned tin\\" - I was like, what? It starts making sense when Kelsier chooses Vin to become part of his crew and starts sharing all of this.<br /><br />Overall I loved the first book in this series, I loved the balls that \\"Valette\\" attended and how she met Elend. Elend being one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />What I like about the book is that it kind of wraps up in a package, and leaves a little room for doubt as to: \\"Okay, what will happen now?\\"<br /><br />Brilliantly written and I highly recommend.

0553386794|1.0|The author deserves the attention he is getting and I have no quibble that he is talented at writing. But. I am so tired of this kind of fantasy. Every damn book I pick up now is FILLED with rape, incest, gruesome killing described in loving detail, more rape and a little more rape after that. Can we get an ACTUAL representation of a strong female character that doesn't exist only to serve men in some way?  Why don't we rape the men characters for a while?  Mix it up a little, but no.  Let's not just rape all the female characters let's include children! yay!<br />I tried to trudge through the first book three seperate times but got thrown off by the introduction of like thirty different characters within the first few chapters.  You introduce a likable family then spend the next four books brutally killing them off and doing all kinds of horrible things to them?  It's like fantasy writing is now 'let's see how much we can get away with before people hurl'.<br /> And for the hordes of angry neckbeards just raring to have a go at me for DARING to dislike their grimdark crap; don't bother, if your defending this rape-fest book I don't think we're going to get along so cry me a river. I'm over this sort of writing being so popular.  You can write a decent and dark book without THAT much rape and killing and really twisted, graphic descriptions.
0312641893|5.0|I am a huge fan of retold fairy tales, especially if they are done well, but Cinderella was never one of my favorite fairy tales. Even the Grimm Brothers couldn't make it all that interesting to me because hey, it's a story about a pathetic girl who can only escape oppression by marrying a prince. It's a sad tale on so many levels. NOT Cinder.<br /><br />Cinder snagged me from the first few pages when I was thrust into a future society (not quite a dystopia but futuristic & gritty enough to keep me interested) and viewing it through the eyes of a girl who has grown up as a second citizen thanks to the cyborg implants that keep her functioning. I found that, in spite of her differences from anything remotely similar to my life, I identified with Cinder. She was immediately likable, smart and witty without being wishy washy or whiny. She withstood her hardships with grace and aplomb. I admired her immensely as I watched her progress through the story. And, while her personality wasn't many-layered, her history was rich with twists that unfolded in just such a manner as to make me want to keep devouring the story until I discovered every single secret her past held. And believe me, it's a fun ride!<br /><br />The world is brilliant as it remembers still how it rose from the rubble of World War IV and is populated with characters who were believable and wonderful. From the charming Prince who is much more than a pretty face to the snarky android sidekick with her own wishes to go to the ball to the creatively designed diplomats from other countries. They didn't annoy me (well, maybe the stepmother & stepsister did but they were supposed to, right?) nor did they bore me.<br /><br />This story had so many elements that I absolutely love. Gritty, hurdles for the protagonist to overcome or stumble over -- Cinder does both at different times which added to my enjoyment. Dark past secrets. Mythology authentic to only the story itself. Wide-ranging conspiracies. Evil that is purely evil & good that is purely good. Not to mention a fine ribbon of realistic romance. It's an all-around great story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories that think outside the box, retell fairy tales, or even have a craving for something sort of steam punk and fun. Read it.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this when it was a Twilight fanfic. LOVED it then and still love it now. Having said that, I think I love it so much because I envisioned it with my favorite fictional couple, Bella and Edward. I adore the powerful and dominant male character (as well as his vulnerabilities)! The story line was great throughout the entire trilogy. I bought the books because the fanfic was removed. While the story line did not change, I did find it a bit hard to read with the new character names. I think James is a very good writer and this is just my two cents, but I loved the story, no matter what label people put on it. But to each his own.
0812550706|5.0|Yes, this book was written probably before you were born. But let me just say how relevant a read it is if you enjoy the futuristic, dystopian type books the way I do. When I finally picked this up off my shelf & sat down to read it, I was immediately sucked into the life of little Ender Wiggin. As I read I could see how much Card has influenced the current science fiction genre in the YA market.<br /><br />First of all, this was a very full-color read. Every world Ender is thrust into is fully mapped & fleshed out, from the playing fields of the game to the Bugger planets to the inner world of the computer game he plays periodically on his desk. Every character was given life & breathed on the pages. Card is a master at getting the psychology down right on his characters, all of which were multi-layered & most of which go through some sort of character growth throughout the book. Reading this book was like being in a simulator while the story played out in front of me because it was just so well written.<br /><br />Not a word of this book was wasted. Everything has meaning & a reason to be part of the story. Ender's struggle through battle school & life in general are fascinating. They reminded me, in part, of the struggles the protagonists go through to reach strength & leadership in The Maze Runner series, The Hunger Games series, & some of the Forest of Hands & Teeth series as well.<br /><br />Some might shy away from the book because it seems so sci-fi but believe me, this is not high science fiction. There aren't any technical science-y terms or complicated ideas to understand. It's the sweeping story of a little boy genius who is being groomed to win a war full of imaginative battle strategies & interesting people to get to know. Some might also shy away from it because it was written in the 1980s. The writing is not stilted or strange. If you were never told the publication date you could swear it was a contemporary book.<br /><br />That said, there were a couple things that I wasn't too fond of about this book. The very end being one of them. I won't spoil it for anyone who may read it but I wasn't thrilled with the life decision Ender made in the final pages. I think there was also some foul language that I didn't feel needed to be in the book though it was funny to read the slang the boys in battle school had come up with -- very Maze Runner!<br /><br />Over all, I was hooked. It's a very important read for anyone who loves the genre the way I do & wants to see some of the landscape that inspired what we read today. Orson Scott Card is a masterful. I'm looking forward to reading the next Ender book. And thankfully, unlike a new release I love, I can just go to the library & pick up the next one TODAY!ouple things that I wasn't too fond of about this book. The very end being one of them.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great book (I read it as one book).  The setting is so simple yet it conjures up very complex and deep questions.  I found myself regularly unable to put it down as the story has a very nice pace to it.  Another thing I liked is that it doesn't follow too many different story lines.  Sometimes authors have so many subplots going on that it takes a long time to get back to where the last one ended.
0307951529|4.0|I'm a fan of Chris Guillibeau's writing and his view of micro business.<br /><br />This book is all about creating a lifestyle based micro business. Chris does an exceptional job of finding obscure and not so obscure entrepreneurs and telling their stories in a way that inspires you to try yourself. He lays out the groundwork for creating an information based business primarily. I would have liked to see a little more focus on what people with traditional service or small retail businesses were doing as well.<br /><br />In terms of setting up the business, the book does a good job of giving you the basics, this is not the one book to end all books on setting up your business. But, if you follow the basic steps and augment with additional reading I think just about anyone could get started with the steps and advice in the book.<br /><br />Where the book falls a little short is delivering on the promise of the title. I really didn't see any business outlined in the book that got started intentionally with just $100 and it would be very difficult to start even an information based business for just $100 . . .but if you are willing to truly bootstrap and do all of the work for yourself, create a product, a website, set up hosting and everything else that is required you could likely come close.<br /><br />What I liked best about this book is the number of possibilities and ideas it generated as I read it. The storytelling is so good that I couldn't stop thinking of possibilities. I also like the back stories about how people are creating lives in the manner they most desire, where they want and with or without families. This is what I find different in this book than the Four Hour Workweek and other books like it. Examples of how families do this, not just 20 somethings really brings it home for an older audience.<br /><br />This book is a great jumping off point for anyone who wants to create a profitable alternative to a job and is guaranteed to help you generate a load of ideas for your own business.ad of ideas for your own business.

B002KYHZLQ|3.0|This series was #2 on a list of best epic fantasy ([...]). Agreeing with the rest of the list I thought it must be a winner. After finishing the book last night I still have a headache. Was it the word jumble of names and places that kept me from recognizing references? Maybe it was how I felt (or really didn't feel) about most of the characters. So many names/races/gods that I couldn't remember who, what or why they were in the story to begin with.    Still I'm buying book two. Because when I was  20% into the book (yes it was so tedious I was tracking progress on the Kindle) the plot came together. Because I do want to know what happens to the girl. Because the complexity of the land and people pulled me in.  Anyway, it's a way to put off studying for a managerial accounting class. So we'll see. I'll invest $6 and let you know.
B00177YA1K|5.0|A superb cast and outstanding storyline make this a movie I enjoy no matter how many times I watch it. Others have detailed the plot so I'll skip that.<br /><br />Only the progress of computer graphics makes this so visually believable (except the size of the alien at the end). The deadpan humor also distracts you from dismissing the movie as too fanciful. The movie is pure fun. For those who have to have a deep lesson for a movie to have value, it would be that humans have an arrogance that needs to be put in its place.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|By: Robin<br /><br />The movie Ali both represents the life of the greatest boxer alive Muhammad Ali and stings like a bee at the box office.<br /><br />The performance by Will Smith in this film was very true to Muhammad Ali himself, and he captured the arrogance, and many personal characteristics of the great boxer in his rendition. The performances by the other supporting characters was also excellent as well, it was easy to The storyline is not as clear as it could have been. To me, many of the relationships that Ali had in the movie, seemed to appear out of the blue and could have had more explanation. The cinematography in this film is quite good, and uses many visual perspectives to tell the story.<br /><br />  As a member of the Nation of Islam, one of the most important points of Ali's religious life was his conversion to Islam. The movie shows Elijah Muhammad naming Ali, and his encounters with the Nation of Islam. However, it doesn't delve very deeply into his devotion of Islam itself. Rather, it represents his self drive and arrogance as a boxer in great depth. He is shown throughout the movie repeating how he is not going to follow anybody else and is going to do it his own way. The most that is presented of Ali's faith is presented in his insistence to be called by his new Islamic name and not by his slave name, Cassius Clay.<br /><br />  As said before, Will Smith does a worthy imitation of Muhammad Ali's speech patterns, although it may seem a bit exaggerated at times. His relationships with Howard Cosell, Malcom X, and Elijah Muhammad have also been represented with historical accuracy. Ali evaded the military draft, and this is shown in the movie as well, including actual quotes that he famously said. The pivotal points in his personal life and career are all covered, some more heavily than others. The fight scenes are quite accurate, especially the last scene in the movie where he fights George Foreman and employs the \\"rope a dope\\" method. Finally, the movie probes into his personal life several times with his several wives and children. It does so rather well, and captures their relationships closely as they happened in his own life. As it tries to be as true to the man himself, this movie is unlike many other docudramas which try to bend the truth to create suspense and drama.<br /><br />  This movie is a well produced movie that encompasses the transformation of Ali from a young boxer into a household name around America and mirrors his life quite accurately. However, It can be a bit drawn out and the fact that it is very accurate to the man's history may make it seem a tad boring throughout many of it's scenes.

0316666343|2.0|Like everyone else, I heard lots of hype for this book. Seemed like an interesting enough premise ... a teenaged girl is raped and murdered, and she tells the story of her family, as well as her murderer from her vantage point in heaven. However, the characters are poorly developed, and the scenes are just disjointed, jumping all over the place. I did not find myself interested in any of the characters at all ... not Susie's mother who has an affair with the detective investigating her daughter's murder, not Susie's inebriated grandmother, nor her various friends. Susie's mother has an affair, then abandons the family. Eventually, she returns, to be accepted back with open arms. Ummmm.... I don't think so.<br /><br />The story was silly and boring. Sorry, but it just did not work for me at all. Oh, and don't get me started on the final couple of chapters, where things just get bizarre. And the ending that was silly and anticlimactic. I only finished the book to see how it would end. Seems like a wasted effort.

B005WFWVL4|3.0|The movie is somewhat scary (regarding the potential speed with which a medical disaster could spread), unrealistic regarding the degree to which society would break down during such a severe contagion (I've seen what happens even during a short hurricane event - would be far, far worse in a prolonged disaster such as depicted in the movie), also unrealistic in the degree of spread at the very beginning, and cluttered up with an irrelevant affair by Matt Damon's wife.<br /><br />The 'solution' - finding and producing a virus was unrealistic as well. I would have preferred a factual accounting of how the recent SARS or H1N1 viruses were controlled.

0307719219|3.0|The authors of 'Why Nations Fail' contend that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie a nation's economic success or failure, not its culture or geography. As examples, they posit North and South Korea - the one thriving while the other barely escapes starvation. Another set of examples - Nogales in the U.S. vs. Nogales in Mexico. The authors contend that nations that became rich did so because their citizens overthrew the elites controlling power and created an environment where the great masses could invest and take advantage of economic opportunities.<br /><br />Spanish rule in South America was designed to force indigenous people's living standards down to a subsistence level and extract the excess. This was achieved by appropriating their lands, forcing them to work for low wages, imposing high taxes, and charging high prices for goods. Efforts to establish a similar system in Virginia failed because there were no valuable minerals and a low population density. Settlements in Virginia succeeded only when settlers were given land as an incentive, as well as all adult men a say in governance.<br /><br />The development climate in the U.S. at the prior turn of the century was much more favorable than in Mexico. There were 27,864 banks in the U.S. in 1914, with total assets of $27.3 billion. In 1910 Mexico, there were only 42, 2 of which controlled 60% of total banking assets. Thus there was little competition for loan business in Mexico, and loans were limited mostly to the privileged and came with high interest rates. U.S. banking started out similarly, but the system was forced to change by voters. Mexico, by contrast, was ruled by military fiat.<br /><br />Frontier lands in most of Latin American countries ere allocated to the politically powerful, and those with wealth and contacts. By contrast, broad access was granted to those lands in the U.S.<br /><br />Only in the 1990s did most Latin American countries become democracies, and even then they were mired in instability. Carlos Slim did not make his money by innovation like Bill Gates did, but through connections. His major coup was the acquisition of Telmex (Mexico's tele-communications monopoly) when it was privatized in 1990s via selling 51% of voting stock (only 20.4% of the total). Slim did not even make the highest bid but his consortium won and then used dividends (not cash) to pay for it. Protective laws and bureaucrats have served him since as protective barriers. Telmex charges among the highest usage fees in the world, according to the OECD. Slim made a foray into U.S. business, violated contracts, and was fined $454 million as a result. Even Bill Gates has felt the force of law in the U.S. - anti-trust law.<br /><br />The authors contend that the most common reason nations fail today is because they have relied on extractive institutions because this situation does not create incentives to save, invest, and innovate. Illustrations offered include Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Another problem - lack of political centralization - eg. Afghanistan and Somalia, while Haiti lost its former centralized power.<br /><br />The authors' definition of extractive institutions (protecting the political and economic power of only a small elite that takes income from everyone else) is broader than might first appear - eg. not limited to natural resources. Example - Uzbekistan, which achieved independence via the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time the stat-owned farms were broken up. However, regulations established what farmers could plant (35% cotton is the norm) and how much they could sell it for to the state (well below market price). Prior to 1991, 40% of the harvest was picked by machine, after the new price limits this was no longer affordable. Now about 75% is picked by school children for very minimal pay ($0.03/kilo, vs. a world price of $1.40) and with quotas of 20-60 kilos/day. Elections are rigged to keep the Karimov (former Communist official) family in power. The authors contend Egypt was largely run in the same manner.<br /><br />All the preceding is interesting, but seems quite slanted. For example - the Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are quite prosperous despite being run by extractive institutions. Their chapter titled 'You Can't Engineer Prosperity' flies in the face of success in China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. And they have no real explanation for China's outstanding successes over the past 30+ years, other than to predict it can't last. Perhaps, though there have been innumerable others before them making the same claim. Regardless, their logic also suggests that U.S. insitutions in their present form that create growing inequality of income and assets with a government dominated by influential donors, cannot last either.otas of 20-60 kilos/day.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is classified as a book for teenagers. I had heard good buzz and, because of its cited targeted readers, had not planned to read it. However when my adult daughter recommended the book and guaranteed I would like it, I took a chance. A week later I had read all three of the books in the series. Suzanne Collins is an amazing storyteller who knows how to grab a reader and never let go until you've finished the book(s). Its brutality, unless I'm reading too much into it, creates a world that is a metaphor for dictators and the cruelty its populous endures. I was reminded of North Korea and its starving masses while the elite feast and Syria with a leader that has no qualms slautering its own people. The book is just a great read for adults and teens!
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|I saw this in the Theater and I wanted my money back in the 1st 20 minutes. It is so weird and odd. They trick ya into seeing it by having Hanks and Bullock in the film. It makes you cry over and over. I usually enjoy and fall in love with movies that make me cry and feel. This movie made me fell like going to the manager and asking for my money back! =(
B006P0FIB0|5.0|I really thought this movie was great. The film has a something for everyone comedy, action, and love. The costumes looked amazing.
0553801473|3.0|The book is good, but its not as good as the others.  I think the book lacks a couple of things as compared with the first three books:<br />1.  The book is more predictable than the others<br />2.  There is not much suspense in the book to keep you turning the pages<br />3.  The main story-lines do not progress as much as I figured they would<br /><br />Hopefully GRRM will return to form with #6, and it won't take 5 years.  However, this book is still good but not great (like the others)
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Hey All!<br /><br />I have made it a habit of buying the music and DVD album simultaneously when they come out--you can't go wrong with this one! The reason I buy both, is that there are some songs on the DVD album that do not occur on the music album!!! In fact, for the last couple of albums, I've made it a point to extract the DVD audio from the album so I can listen to the live performance and not have to watch it. Quite Nice!  I was able to extract the AC3 Digital Surround Sound and downmix it to Left and Right Audio for a nice ambient mix!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent book.  Lots of intrigue and suspense to keep you highly entertained.  Fantastic series with great character development.
B001HN6918|4.0|A GREAT sequel! This one will definitely make you laugh! It does feel a little different than the first one, them chasing down the villain seemed to be the focal point in it, but it does tell about Po's history of how he came to be adopted by a goose. Very entertaining movie, a must see! Good for all ages!
0553582038|4.0|I thought it was very good, but not as good the first three.  Perhaps my opinion would be more jaded had I waited 4 years like the people who actually had to wait for this one.
B00466HN6S|4.0|I thought this was going to be solely an animated movie but its live action mixed with animation like Alvin & the Chipmunks.  The movie was actually A LOT like Alvin & the Chipmunks, so if you liked that one, you'll definitely like this! Like other reviewers said, the beginning and middle of the movie are very entertaining, lots of comedy thanks to Russell Brand & the rising star, James Marsden, but the end is pretty cheesy and doesn't end with the fun feeling that the rest of the movie had. Also could have done without the bunny playing the drums.. a little too much like the chipmunks...or \\"the Hoff\\"... Overall, a very cute Easter movie!
0307474275|2.0|Angels and Demons was great, but this was boring.  I had to force myself to read this, instead of looking forward to the next chapter.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|The idea behind this movie really was great, scary, but great, the thought that instead of money, we use our life's minutes as payment for things, very original. Justin Timberlake was VERY good in this and Amanda Seyfried has come a long way since Mean Girls. In the future, people have a time clock on their arm and when they turn 25 years old, it turns on with a time on it of 1 year which counts down each minute and they never physically age past that point. People can use the remaining time on their arm to buy things and can work to receive more time on it, but when the time runs out, they die. There are time zones which are basically areas of poverty and the smaller numbered time zones are the wealthy people that have been alive for at least 100 years with centuries more to go, so basically they live forever while the poor struggle with the small amount of time they were given and are put at a disadvantage to never move up in life from the time zone they live in. But Justin Timberlake's character is not ok with this system... the only reason I gave it only 3 stars is because in the middle, it drags on quite a bit with not much happening, but the beginning and end are great!! Well worth watching!
0743497465|3.0|A entertaining, well written, solid read.  Its fun while it lasts, then its forgettable.  A good book worth the time and money.
B006Z21ZEM|2.0|What Maiden doesnt seem to realize or care about are the fans that have stuck with the from the beginning. I have gone to 4 of their shows in the last 6 years.  They hardly played any of what made Maiden who they are They even has the audacity to exclaim \\"We are only playing new songs....if you came here for nostalgia, then you arent our real fans!\\"  .....WTF!!! Really.....bite me Bruce!  This CD sucks. Yeah yeah yeah......cry at me all you want. I jave loved Maiden since I was 8 years old, but to rip on their original fans is ridiculous.  This CD is a waste of money.
055357342X|5.0|Hands down, the best book I have ever read.  The first half of the book is great, the second half is amazing.  The ending is phenomenal.  The Jaime Lannister storyline is unexpected and extremely entertaining.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Tried to keep as many spoilers out as possible and think I did a good job.<br /><br />So I'll be honest and say I only read this series because of all the hype it was generating, hell I never even heard of it till they mentioned they were making a movie based off it. That being said I read what many (or at least I do)<br />feel largely inspired the premise of this book Koushun Takami's Battle Royale way back in 2004; however, while I did enjoy his book more overall I did like several elements from Suzanne Collins' more.<br /><br />For instance I felt Collins' world made by far more sense then Takami's and while both televised these \\"games\\", in The Hunger Games (odd name whats hungry about it besides the contestants starving? Battle Royale is cooler) Collins<br />did a FAR better job showing the full perversity of the games and the toll they take on both the contestants and communities. In Battle Royale little to none was mentioned of the families and the effect on the community of the games. Heck it felt<br />more like they all supported them.<br /><br />I have heard many complain that the premise is silly and say things like \\"Why are the the people of Panem are so resigned to sending their children to die?\\" or \\"They would never stand for it it is unrealistic.\\" to which I say umm WWII and the Nazi's? \\"Whats happening in Africa and many other places even today with child soldiers? How many people ignore what was and is happening? Another complaint it that people don't question the games or stand up to them and if they ask those questions they obviously need the read the books again. On the top of my head there was Haymitch (wont spoil it read the books), all the districts who rebelled (granted that was before the games but they did against the capital for it's inequality compared to all its supporting districts), and obviously some planning for the rebellion had already been going on before Katniss ever stood up to the capital. It is a book some leniency has to be given to all fiction.<br /><br />But there were bad things too I felt the characters weren't as good in The Hunger Games.<br />The main character, Katniss, for instance I found dull, irritating, and ... thick. While believably skilled, considering her situation at home, nothing about her wowed me or even really like her. (other then the odd moment) While some numbness is understandable do to her situation and need to protect herself from herself (namely her feelings), she felt lifeless like a supporting character made to play the role of lead. All her best moments were when she got angry to which I particularly mean the scene (without giving too much away) with the apple. I would have loved to see more of that girl and not the oh woe is me who do I really love, blah blah blah.<br /><br />As for the ending I have but one word epilogue. I was left wanting more not in the sense of the series was just that awesome but what happened to the people of the capital now that they had no more people to mooch off of and what of the districts now that they are free? I wasn't expecting a whole chapter but after hearing about the districts and they struggles and whatnot I wanted to hear what became of them. A paragraph or two saying something as simple as they basically each became their own city states and continuing in their specialties traded their goods between each other making them all more prosperous. Maybe it is just me that likes a good solid conclusion and not just flash forward and they are old and still living happily ever after... or similar endings.<br /><br />All in all an great read with its ups and downs and I'm left with the feeling that this is indeed a book better suited to a younger audience (young adults and teens) and if you want to read something similar and just as good if in different ways I highly recommend reading [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]] as well and hey it has a movie too two in fact.
1594744769|4.0|While the plot of Miss Peregrine's is great all by itself, perhaps the most striking things about the book are the bizarre, old photographs (including the one you see on the cover), which the author swears are not re-touched.<br /><br />But I have to admit, I started to read in anticipation of the photos. Long after I finished reading, I was still wondering about some of those images.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's will really kick your imagination into overdrive, which is one of the best reasons to read any book.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|We spent hours playing this game and really enjoyed it. It's beautiful.  It keeps your interest without being so difficult that you get frustrated.  Make more, please.
0439023521|4.0|The \\"Hunger Games\\" - reflects the current generation's love of reality shows - a la \\"Survivor,\\" their \\"video game\\" mentality, and need for instant gratification, and blends it with classic dystopian novels: \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" \\"The Giver,\\" \\"The House of the Scorpion,\\" \\"1984,\\" and arguably one of the best, \\"Brave New World.\\"<br />So now what we have is a \\"new and improved\\" post-apocalyptic YA novel (I'll leave it to you if it is fiction or not). The novel is well developed; the plot is tense, gritty, and engrossing. Collins's characters are completely realistic and sympathetic as they form alliances and friendships in the face of overwhelming odds. Although we all can agree that the premise of the killings is somewhat objectionable and/ or disturbing; however, so was it in Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" or the sexual relationships in Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\"  Still, without question, the book is very good; I would teach it in my junior or senior classes in a heartbeat! (That's a great way to ruin a good book!)<br /><br />  The \\"Hunger Games\\" - there is little left to say that has not already been said!  Being an English teacher (sorry about that), I have long been interesting in books that get students reading. In the late 90's, the \\"Harry Potter\\" series began to set the reading world on fire; I was enthralled with that series when I saw families carrying a Potter book and even talking about the book!  Some minor series followed onto the YA horizon, and then later came the \\"Twilight\\" series which got readers reading by moonlight. Now, it is the \\"Hunger Games\\" series which is sweeping the nation. Although I am not promoting \\"The Reading Games,\\" just anything that promotes reading is good!<br /><br />  America has collapsed, weakened by drought, fire, famine, and war, to be replaced by Panem, a country divided into the Capitol and 12 districts. Each year, two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery (a tip of the hat to Shirley Jackson) to participate in The Hunger Games.  The Games are a mixture of entertainment, propaganda, and a form of mental intimidation of the subjugated districts; the televised games are broadcasted throughout Panem as the 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors, literally, with all citizens required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, the son of the town baker, will be pitted against bigger, stronger representatives. The pages turn faster as the book progresses. Sarah, a friend of mine, said it best: \\"I struggled to put this down. Though everyone told me how good it was, I just didn't expect to be as enthralled as I was.\\"
B007MG360G|3.0|Good game. However, lyrics from a Phish song called &quot;Run like an Antelope&quot; are used without accreditation when you create an antelope. Disappointing. Other quotes are given due credit.

1589949811|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a truly excellent cooperative card game.  This is a game in which the mechanics perfectly reinforce the game's theme to genuinely recreate the experience of being a party of heroes struggling to complete a quest.  The game is scenario-based, with lots of \\"Encounter Cards\\" per scenario, and when combined with customizable player decks, this element makes for lots of replayability.  The various components and tokens that come with the cards in the box are very nice-looking, and the graphic design-work put into this package is of very high quality.  The artwork on the cards is stunningly beautiful -- so much so that I would recommend buying this game to any devoted Tolkien fan solely for the artwork on the cards.  Thankfully, the characters depicted on the cards do not look exactly like the characters from the movies (sometimes, not even close), and it is highly refreshing to finally see a new vision of Tolkien's creations.  Furthermore, the adventures and quests which the heroes must complete do not originate from Tolkien's brain, although the locales and creatures do, so those of us who are a bit weary of walking to Mordor to dunk a ring in a volcano now have a few more perilous items added to our to-do lists.<br /><br />Like many cooperative games, this one can be played with a single player (that's you!).  And both solitaire and multiplayer are fun and rewarding experiences -- a two-player game being the most fun for me personally because it is relatively easy to find synergies between the two player decks (a simple example of this would involve one player fielding a Tactics deck with lots of attacking power, while the other player uses Spirit cards to keep the players' threat level low and make progress on the quests).  Because of the tension created by the game and the threats coming out of the Encounter Deck, both players will often have to find ways to come to each other's aid, so it never feels like you are just lookingout for yourself in a multiplayer game.  The game scales fairly well, but playing solitaire is always tricky because you usually do not have enough space in your deck for cards that can effectively counter every individual threat generated by the Encounter Deck.  Some of the scenarios, such as \\"Escape from Dol Guldur,\\" the third and most difficult quest in the core set, were obviously not meant for solo play.<br /><br />In fact the three scenarios, or quests, included in the core set are all fairly challenging for newer players, but with practice and as one learns the Encounter Deck, they are all very winnable.  However, it will soon become apparent that building an effective player deck to counter each Encounter Set will be necessary to winning games, and the experience of crafting your own strategic approach and exploiting card combinations, and then testing your homemade decks against the various scenarios is highly rewarding in itself.  There are some player cards in this set that seem a bit overpowered, and utilizing these to their fullest can almost feel like cheating, but it is very possible that as more scenarios appear -- via Adventure Packs -- the designers will find ways to puzzle and frustrate our heroes once again.<br /><br />One aspect of this game that stirs up quite a bit of debate would be the rules.  The game rules contained inside of the ~30-page rule book can be a bit intimidating to new players, especially non-gamers.  Each game round has seven phases, and the game as a whole is fairly elegant and nuanced, but as a particular game progresses, players will find each game round goes quicker and becomes fairly streamlined.  Further, because it is a cooperative game it is not too difficult to teach because newer players do not have to be familiar with all of its intricacies.  And be warned, there are a lot of them.  You'll often find yourself wondering if a certain action is legal, or what the effect of an Encounter Card does in a specific situation.  Usually, it is best to interpret the text on the cards as literally as possible, but if that does no good, there are plenty of card references and FAQ's available online.  But even with these resources, you will still occasionally find yourself in situations in which you just don't know what the correct resolution would be.<br /><br />This is not necessarily a weakness of the game.  The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is so flavorful and fun that home-brewed rules interpretations do not get in the way of a highly enjoyable game experience, and neither do scenarios that are sometimes either too easy or too difficult to win.<br /><br />I gave this game a five-star rating, but that does not mean that as a product, this box set does not have some weaknesses, and they are pretty dissappointing at that.  For one, as many others have pointed out, there is no convenient way to store the cards in the box.  Another huge downer is that the core set does not come with three of each player card (a tournament-legal deck can have as many as three of any one card, and some of these cards you really want to have three of), although that does not mean that there are not enough cards to build a decent deck with.  At present, the only way to rectify this situation is to purchase three core sets.  Thankfully, Fantasy Flight fixed this problem in all of the expansions released so far: each of them come with three copies of the included player cards.  Another downside is the fact that the cards themselves will wear out pretty quickly if you play frequently, so make sure to buy some sleeves and sleeve your beautiful new cards right away.  And one last nitpick would be that some of the artwork is recycled in the expansion packs.  So far I have only caught two cards that share the same artwork, and hopefully this will not continue to occur as more packs are released.<br /><br />Downsides aside, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a fun, refreshing, challenging, and beautiful game, and its excellence is the only reason why such small flaws are so disappointing.  But all in all, this game is high quality and highly recommended.  I know I will be playing it for a long time to come, and I really can't wait for those Adventure Packs I ordered last week to get here.

B0041B785Y|5.0|Meshuggah's new album, Koloss, stands up to any of their other work.  It should assure their fans that the band has no lack of creativity within the genre they've created, showing that a group can progress within their own sound without necessarily breaking new ground.  Bottom line is, if you've liked the last few Meshuggah albums, you'll have no trouble getting into this one.  Here's how each track breaks down.<br /><br />I Am Colossus begins like ObZen continued, sounding slow, stark, and brooding.  A couple minutes in, you can hear why drummer Tomas Haake has said they wanted a more organic sound, because it starts to sound like they're all playing together.  The drums sound live and the guitars warmer than on ObZen.<br /><br />The Demon's Name is Surveillance continues the more organic vibe, sounding almost like Contradictions Collapse, not in style, but in the recording itself; it's less refined, more raw.  The style is more like Chaosphere, with a heavy, heavy groove and old-school tech solos.<br /><br />Do Not Look Down--Like the Nothing album, it has a bouncy groove.  Jens Kidman is not screaming as much as on ObZen;  you can hear more voice in the vocals.  This one has a nice solo that sounds a bit like something from Destroy Erase Improve.<br /><br />Behind the Sun offers more of that slow, menacing crawl of some ObZen tracks, monstrous drumming, and gradually moves into some absolutely massive grooves.<br /><br />The Hurt That Finds You First is fast, almost thrashy, but more like the fast parts of the \\"I\\" EP than their first couple albums (but with maybe a trace of Contradictions Collapse in the guitars); it's definitely different from anything on ObZen, Catch Thirtythree, or Nothing, ending with some clean guitar that reminds me of Destroy Erase Improve again.  Pretty amazing track.<br /><br />Marrow features stop-and-start, spastic riffing, and more brilliant soloing.  Robb Flynn once described Meshuggah's music as the soundtrack to an epileptic seizure.  It was because of songs like Marrow.<br /><br />Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave it Motion--Aside from that catchy title, it sounds like a Nothing/ObZen hybrid of slow, heavy groove.  A worthy, if somewhat standard, Meshuggah track with  more trippy, eerie guitar work like Destroy Erase Improve.  Sounds good.<br /><br />Swarm--Parts of this remind of \\"I\\" again, with an eclectic, almost improvisational vibe in some sections (around 3 minutes in).  This is Meshuggah showing off.  It's one of those songs that I'm blown away by, as it's completely over my head on a musical level.<br /><br />Demiurge--Another ObZen/Nothing cross with monster grooves, with a touch of spacey guitar parts.  The riffs on this one crush.<br /><br />The Last Vigil--Instrumental \\"outro\\" that's like that long middle section of In Death--Is Death from Catch Thirtythree.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll be listening to Koloss over and over in the next few months.  It has enough variety, technicality, and amazing musicianship to find something different in each song every time I hear it.  Excellent job by one of the best bands in metal.e.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Wow, how can this album end up being reviewed consistently at a five and one star all over the board?  I started listening to BRUUUUCCCEEE at 15 and he changed my life.  Now at 33 he still does.  If you can't appreciate the decline in our country now and hear those words reflected in \\"Wrecking Ball\\" maybe you should listen to someone less in touch. Yes, \\"Darkness\\" is awesome as is  \\"Tunnel of Love\\" but this ain't the carefree 80's no more.  And as for being a protest album?  If that is what he was going for, he did it.  No one will use \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" in any political debate here and now. Cause we don't!  Love you Bruce, forever and always!

B00756GKBA|5.0|I've been a fan of Madonna since 1983, music has change a lot since then and Madonna has defined much of that over the years. I must say that her latest albums the 2000's albums have been just good for me not reaching the peak in my Madonna taste (excet a few songs from the Music and Confessions albums that are really great). I didn't know what to expect when i saw that she has left WB after almost 30 years there and signing with Live Nation, i was a little bit afraid of what could happen to one of my favorite music icons. But now i see that she has come very refreshed with something for everyone in this album. After 30 years of good songs, good albums, spectacular world tours and one of the most successful carreers in the entertaining world she knows who she is and where she is standing right now, and that shows up  in MDNA. She is the very respected Queen of Pop and everybody knows it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I really like the graphics and gameplay that quell offers.  some of the early puzzles are pretty easy, but the game gets a little harder once you get into the 3rd level.  solid game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I will start by saying that I never leave reviews... this is a first. This book was better than I could have ever imagined! I glanced at it; the description and the reviews in the past and kept looking... this time I was able to read a sample through my Kindle and I couldn't put it down!.. I bought it right away. As tortured as it is, the love story between Ana and Christian is so real (aside from the millionare thing). The feelings that she has; the trepidation and the want that she can't get past is everything that I look for in a love story! This is a must read in my opinion!! I've started book two last night and of course, I can't put it down!
0812992792|4.0|At first, Adam Johnson's The Orphan Master's Son appears to be a straight-forward story set in a nation surrounded in secrecy and deception, North Korea. Pak Jun Do is the son of a man who operates a camp where orphans are dumped until either adopted to work at hard labor or who perform ad hoc hard labor. His mother, a wonderful singer, was taken years ago. Jun Do names all the orphans after war heroes, saving for himself the name of a warrior who proved he could be trusted by killing himself.<br /><br />During the long famine, the orphans die off, his father runs off and Jun Do ends up in the tunnels, trained to kill in the dark. He next surfaces in the hold of a rusting fishing vessel, monitoring radio transmissions by night and trying to fit in with the crew. He's deemed a hero, sent to Texas, sent to prison and tortured, sent to impersonate a former hero of the nation now in disfavor, and tortured. His life is not his own.<br /><br />The novel throws some strange twists at the reader and tries more than one way to convey narrative. After Jun Do is sent to prison, a second narrator, a nameless interrogator who tries to get the truth from him, carries part of the story. He cares for his blind parents, who are afraid to say anything that would not be approved by the ruling elite. This interrogator, who tortures people, is as powerless as anyone though, getting swept up in involuntary rice harvesting because he's out on the street and not on a bus. Part of the story is told as the annual Best North Korea story broadcast daily. Part of it backtracks to what happened when Jun Do disappeared and became commander Ga, military hero and husband of beloved actress Sun Moon.<br /><br />The Orphan Master's Son is ultimately about the ways that, when leaders deceive us, we not only go along with it in order to survive, we find new ways to fool ourselves. The actress Sun Moon sees starving families scavenging through tree branches, trying to find chestnuts to eat even though they are as illegal as poaching the king's deer was in Olde England. She says they are acrobats performing for her.<br /><br />Jun Do is forced by the captain of the fishing trawler on which he is parked with his listening radio to act like a fisherman when the Americans board, and fails. He fools himself into thinking the crew and captain were like a family. He is left in the apartment of the wife of the Second Mate, who deserts, and she thinks she will be given to some handsome hero of the country as a replacement spouse. Instead, two old, corrupt men are the possibilities.<br /><br />The fishermen of North Korea have portraits of their wives tattoed on their chests. Jun Do's chest is tattoed aboard ship with the portrait of Sun Moon after his poor job of impersonating a real seaman. The real Sun Moon is given to Commenader Ga as a wife. Jun Do ends up impersonating Ga. Sun Moon is told to treat him as her husband. \\"Dear Leader\\" knows it's an impersonation but calls him Ga and refers to Jun Do as another person.<br /><br />All this deceit from above, from the daily news that the Americans are attacking, that South Korea is suffering from natural disasters and North Korea is shipping food and medicine to the rescue, that the entire world envies North Korea. The characters in this novel don't let themselves question these \\"truths\\". It's as if they know that that way lies madness. The few times their understanding breaks through are brief and poignant. Sun Moon, for example, without saying so, realizes her mother has not retired to a seaside town to enjoy life. But her eyes show \\"a darker knowing\\". And then she snaps back into her role of obedient citizen. When confronted later with more unwanted information on the subject, she tells the informant: \\"You're a thief,\\" she said. \\"You are a thief who came into my life and stole everythng that mattered to me.\\"<br /><br />Commander Ga has a sorrowful reminder of his past as Jun Do while in prison when a character from earlier in the novel returns unexpectedly. While comforted, he is called a poor little orphan. He returns to his usual refrain: I am not an orphan. Yes he is. But he will never say so. As another character tells him, he can speak a lie while telling the truth.<br /><br />And he tells himself \\"of how difficult it was to come to see the lies you told yourself, the ones that llowed you to function and move forward. To really do it, you needed someone's help.\\"<br /><br />Johnson presents all this deceit within the context of humans trying to survive. There is no national hubris, no sense of superiority from a Western writer.<br />The characters became people who, while not often allowing themselves to think through the ramifications of their plight, were still capable of caring for others. They became people whose lives mattered. And how they were going to avoid outcomes that were not devastating was going to take a magician's talent. For the second half of the book, a reader could well wonder if Johnson was going to pull it off. The ending is rather cinematic, as many novel endings are these days, but he keeps to the spirit of what he has been trying to accomplish. The ending works if the readers believes that despite what the North Korean characters say and do, they know the truth of their situation.<br /><br />At the same time, North Korean and American cultural differences were a natural part of the story. The trip to Texas, as part of a delegation visiting a Texas senator at home, is a strong story in its own right. It has repercussions and implications throughout the rest of the novel, but the various layers of communicating frankly and in code play out brilliantly. The North Koreans, whether living under a brutal dictator or not, are thoroughly disgusted by some of the things they see. An outdoor barbecue is being forced to eat outside with filthy dogs. Cutting brush, an activity George Bush delighted in doing for the cameras, is seen as degrading slave labor. And what is wrong with these Americans that they have to put cheese on all their food?

B003EYVXV4|5.0|I first read The Hunger Games two years ago and adored it -- thought it would make a good movie, in fact. Flash forward and here we are, with a monster hit adaptation. I won't go into the story or the characters, since if you're reading this you're probably already familiar. I had my doubts about some of the casting (mainly Peeta and Gale), but I'm happy to say that, though it doesn't touch the Harry Potter series, this is one young adult lit adaptation that doesn't suck.<br /><br />Filmed primarily with a naturalistic eye, and led by the incredibly effective Jennifer Lawrence, the movie deposits us immediately into the impoverished, rural setting of District 12. This is a science fiction future that, barring a few of the more outlandish flourishes, feels startlingly real. I'd put that down to the genuine emotion in every frame, and the decision to forego massive CGI overkill in favor of grit and texture.<br /><br />Of course, it's not all trees and dirt. The decadent Capital is well-rendered, despite being populated by a cast that looks like transplants from a Lady Gaga tribute act (which I guess was probably somewhat intentional). The film, like the book, pauses here for awhile before getting to the nonstop action of the Arena. This was one of my favorite sequences in the book--a barbed skewering of reality television and the entertainment industry. It doesn't register quite as powerfully on screen, but the film still hits all the right notes.<br /><br />Then we're whisked off to the Arena, where the action really kicks in. Those tense minutes as the Tributes are being released into the game are some of the most harrowing moments on film in the last few years. The stakes are high--about as high and personal as they get. The violence is never gratuitous but always unsettling. It's one thing reading about kids killing kids, and quite another seeing it on screen. It's brutal, but effectively so. From this point until the end of the movie, it's nearly constant suspense. The \\"cave scene\\" with Katniss and Peeta, my least favorite in the book, has thankfully been shortened for the film.<br /><br />At nearly two and a half hours, The Hunger Games is the rare epic-length film that flies by. It's relentlessly paced, taut in both story and character, and just as shocking as it needs to be. Now, it'll be interesting to see what they do with the next two books--especially since this first one is widely considered to be the best. A-

B0034G4P80|5.0|This installment in the Marvel franchise is the second best. That is not a slight because I love the Iron Man series, but rather a recognition that this movie is almost as good as my favorite super hero movie. It was well executed, well written, and fit into the overall franchise very well. The acting was great and it did a great job of reflecting the comic book in a true form. It was just a great effort and very entertaining. It just was a Tony Stark-centric movie, which was my only complaint. Get it and enjoy!!!!

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I don't understand all the disapointment. Amaryllis is a thrill from start to end. Is it Sound Of Madness? No. Was it fair to assume it would be? No. It's an original CD with original ideas and emotion. Not an attempted copy of a master piece. They did a great job on this one. The key tracks here are I'm Not Alright, Nowhere Kids, Bully, and For My Sake. The song that makes this CD though is Amaryllis. Simply amazing. I'd say this CD is the second best studio project in the Shinedown catalog. Get it now folks!

B006ZT47O0|2.0|Being an Epica fan, I was eagerly anticipating a new album from them, seeing as how good The Divine Conspiracy and Design Your Universe albums are.  Well, Epica titled this album perfectly, as I am totally indifferent about it. It is not an advancement of their catalog or the Female-Fronted Symphonic Metal genre.  The riffs are tired, Marc's growling is getting annoying, and Simone's vocals are dishearteningly flat.  Her voice never soars like they do in \\"Chasing the Dragon\\" on TDC or \\"Tides of Time\\" on DYU.  Also, no clean male vocals on this album.  They were great on DYU but absent here.  I think Epica needs some new blood.  The recent news that they are getting a new bassist is a step in the right direction but more may be necessary.  I guess the most damning thing I can say about RFTI is that I will not be making a copy for keeping in my car.  Buy only if your an Epica superfan.<br /><br />Addendum:  If you have an early pressing, the last track was mastered with no lead vocals.  I got an email from Nuclear Blast with a link to download the track with leads, and it's the best song from this album.  Simone's voice shows a lot of range and is her best work here.  Kind of telling that the best song was screwed up in mastering.

B005CM9DX6|4.0|I finally got around to checking out this release from one of my favorite bands, and even though everything I'd read told me it was very different, nothing could have prepared me for how different it actually is.<br /><br />Keep in mind, Opeth once departed almost entirely from their black and doom metal roots with their release Damnation. While Heritage is a much tamer album than their usual efforts, it's much different than Damnation, as well. I think it would be a mistake to approach Heritage as if it's another album like Damnation.<br /><br />Heritage seems almost like an intimate experience with Opeth. It's almost as if we are with them in their rehearsal space while they are jamming on some new material. That isn't to say the songs on Heritage are underdeveloped or not well performed. As usual, they are both deliberately composed with inspiration and performed extremely well. But the songs have a freeform, loose quality to them. Familiar and solid song structure has never been a characteristic of Opeth's music. Instead, Opeth has tended to compose in progressive and amorphous structures. Heritage takes their progressive and experimental journey up a notch, working from a state of silence rather than a guitar-riff base and allowing the other instruments to breathe. For example, the keys on this album are much more pronounced and interesting than in previous records.<br /><br />That said, while Heritage is an entertaining and rich listening experience, it isn't very memorable. There aren't many moments on repeat listens that make me glad I went back to it. Instead, the album works on a grander scale, which will probably provide a unique moment in the album of their career.<br /><br />It's the nature of art that some people will hate what you do, and some will love it. I think most Opeth fans won't like Heritage because it's such a departure from what they've done before both structurally and stylistically. However, Opeth fans who appreciate the band for their ingenuity and creativity, who look past their ability to make heads bang and crowds mosh and into their artistry, will probably find Heritage to be a very special album in Opeth's discography. Heritage seems almost to be a nod to those fans, in particular.<br /><br />For me, one thing stops me from loving Heritage as much as their best work: Mikael and Fredrik recorded the album almost entirely with their neck pickups, which gives their guitars a bluesy tone. I like it during the clean parts, but in the few heavy moments Heritage does feature, their guitars barely growl when they should scream. In those parts, you can even hear drummer Martin Axenrot back off because the guitars just aren't there. Fortunately, their sound never gets muddy, but in those moments where they play riffs that should melt faces, and seem written and placed to do so, they, instead, feel out of place. And I think everyone, even fans who don't know anything about guitars, will stop and wonder where Opeth's bite went. Throughout the album, the tame quality doesn't seem as apparent as in those moments, where it seems Opeth is trying to take the music to a heavy place but just can't quite get there.<br /><br />Fortunately, those moments of awkwardness aren't frequent on Heritage. Instead, we can listen to the quiet moments that are both beautiful and haunting, one Opeth trademark Heritage continues masterfully.<br /><br />On a note unrelated to the band, Roadrunner seems to have tried to do something silly with the bonus tracks. If you buy the limited edition for the two extra tracks, you'll find those two songs aren't on the disc. They are mp3s you must download. Once you finally find the website, you have to launch an app and do some wonky stuff to \\"activate\\" your disk. It seems to have compatibility issues, and I had to contact tech support. After a couple days, they provided me with a code to download the tracks, but it was an annoyance I shouldn't have had to deal with. The part that really bothers me is the mp3s are lo-fi. They're an acceptable quality, but they aren't CD quality. What's worse is one of the reasons I still buy real CDs is to have a backup of all the music in case I lose the mp3 files. Just for these two songs, I would have to burn a CD. It ends up being not worth it. The extra tracks are still worth the purchase, but be aware Roadrunner didn't think selling a limited edition of this album was worth a second pressing of the disk.
0679735909|4.0|Roland, a minor researcher of Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash, comes across something unexpected.  In an untouched file at the library he finds a small bit of correspondence--an unfinished letter of admiration to an unidentified woman.  He knows that this discovery could possibly change the course of scholarship surrounding Ash.<br /><br />Roland begins a secret inquiry, which results in a working partnership with a feminist literary scholar named Maud who specializes in a woman poet, a contemporary of Ash, who might be the intended recipient of Ash's letter.<br /><br />Together, Roland and Maud pool their resources and knowledge to work out the mystery of exactly what the connection was between their two poets.<br /><br />I loved the mystery aspect of this book, and the way that the story of Ash and LaMotte slowly came to light.  I also liked the slowly developing relationship between Roland and Maud, as their caution gave way to friendship.  The thrill of the chase, as the other Ash experts closed in on this potentially important information, added another aspect of danger and intrigue.  The postscript changed the ending of the story from tragic to satisfying.<br /><br />I didn't love the poetry sprinkled throughout the book.  It was, no doubt, worthwhile and literary and important, but I couldn't bring myself to pause in the middle of the book's narrative in order to go into a deep analysis of poetry.  I found it more distracting than enlightening.
B007NYODBS|5.0|&#34;Carnage&#34; opens like a play which it was adapted from and is tautly directed by Roman Polanski.  Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster) along with husband Michael (John C. Reilly) invite the Cowans to their apartment; Nancy (Kate Winslet) and her work-consumed husband, Christoph Waltz.  The Longstreets feel it necessary to discuss the reason why their &#34;victim&#34; son was struck, and badly hurt, by the &#34;maniac brutalizer&#34; Cowan's son.  Michael would simply appreciate an apology from their child although Penelope seems to have her own agenda and intends to push it.<br /><br />Penelope and Nancy have a tremendous amount of tension between them which is palpable from the onset.  Michael appears personable, overly generous and friendly ... at first.  On the other hand,  Mr. Cowan is aloof about the subject, on his cell phone constantly as a pharmaceutical lawyer who is much more absent in the genesis of the conversation.<br /><br />The 'go-around' all plays out mainly in one room, the living room, with a small scene in the hallway and if you are quick, you just may see a 'guest' appearance.  You can literally feel the air suck right out of the space. It becomes claustrophobic and dizzying as the couples begin wildly talking, accusing, and definitely getting far off the subject of their sons.  In this obvious stress inducing situation, especially for Nancy and then Penelope, anxiety builds and the topics get verbally and emotionally out of control.  The discussion of the children's situation is quickly set aside while personal marital issues insidiously invade the conversation.  More like spouting-offs!<br /><br />The husbands slowly get involved by first defending their wives, arguing with each other, and then challenging each other.  The Scotch then comes out on the scene as they now decide it would be a great time to take a vintage bottle out for a ride.  Nancy demands a drink for herself while defending Penelope, then challenges a reluctant Michael to pour his wife some also.  Alliances are formed and broken then reattached almost as fast as the mercurial, rapid-fire dialogue. The words are shot between them as caustic arrows and hit just as harshly.  The husbands start to turn on their wives while getting highly frustrated; &#34;You think too much...women think too much&#34; and &#34;Yes, I feel like being completely despicable&#34;.<br /><br />The talking and arguing become amazingly ludicrous in this verbal smack-down.  All four actors are on top of their game in the film.  This tightly wound, inflammatory, and hilarious study is actually very human, as one topic is flying into another then back again.<br /><br />At the very end of the film, right before the credits roll, there is one of the best scenes for tying up all the loose ends and also a good shot in the arm of laughter for myself.  It does put seemingly huge things in perspective in a very scant way and amount of time.pour his wife some also.

0385523912|1.0|Although the stories are compelling in and of themselves, the writing is not as strong as one would expect from someone with Ms. Demick's credentials.  Being of Korean descent myself, I found her offensive sometimes (she calls one korean dish \\"slimy\\" and states that dog is a regular part of korean diets - neither is true).  Her loose and liberal translations don't make any sense, and she uses the archaic notation for Korean pronunciation so that Korean words when pronounced the way Demick writes them, sound totally wrong - this type of notation is from the 70s and 80s - and reveals her lack of true intimate knowledge of the Korean people, on either side of the border.
0062112430|5.0|Okay, so I first heard about Delirium on its release date, but after reading the summary online I thought; this book can't be any good, right? Who writes about love being forbidden by the government? I thought it wouldn't be interesting and somewhat boring. So, I skipped it and went along to find another book written by Lauren Oliver : Before I Fall, which is by the way, AMAZING! Enough said. After I finished it I was so astound by her writing that I thought I had to give one of her only other books a chance so that I could maybe, possibly, get another taste of her delicious words! Picking up Delirium was one of the best choices I could have made. My only regret is that I didn't read it when I first had the chance. Lauren Oliver has a way of expressing her characters in an enjoyable light and sense of humor. She writes beautiful quotes and phrases at the beginning of each chapter that play along with the story perfectly well. And although her dystopian world is not a realistic one, the situations her characters found themselves in were. I even found myself getting frustrated and having to put the book down at some of the horrible things that were happening to Lena. I felt I could greatly relate to her issues with Alex like when I was in high school. The only down fall to the story is that like other reviews have mentioned; there's no past to the reason why the United States forbids love. In our modern day there isn't any suggestion as to how one day we may end up living in a world like Lena's. But then again, who cares!? Seriously. IT'S A FICTIONAL LOVE STORY. GET OVER IT.<br />On another note: I think Oliver's idea of forbidden love, and the way it played out in the end was absolutely brilliant. It's something I would have never, ever expected! EVER. I didn't see it coming. Or I was just really oblivious and routing for them the whole time! But Reading this story made me so angry at times. Being a girl who is in love, I completely understand why Lena does all thatshe does. If that were me, I'd done just what she has, and then fought with my nails and teeth. Personally, I agree; I would rather die than live one day without love. The fact someone would want to stop one person from loving another built a burning rage inside me. This is something that DOES happen in our modern age. But the ending completely ruined my day, and unfortunately I was reading it while I was at work. My co-worker that it was hilarious that I was crying so hard over a book...I'm just happy that I bought part 2 (Pandemonium) as a package deal <3
0756686970|2.0|This is something I wish I had thought to look at in a bookstore before buying.  Each page features one lego figurine, and highlights a bunch of marketing facts along with the star wars facts.  I had thought it would be a fun book for my 6 year old who has a few star wars lego sets, but instead of a fun reference guide, it basically tells you what exact set you have to buy to get all the rest.  I feel like I paid for a sales catalog.  The little figurine is cute but not worth the price. I'm unwilling to actually give it to my son because I dont like marketing directed at kids.  Not sure what I will do with it...maybe gift it to a kid whose parents have the money to buy all the sets?

B001CTDH76|5.0|Unlike some other detective shows, \\"The Mentalist\\" has another story other than the casual criminal cases. It's well balanced with humor usually coming from the main character Patrick Jane, but that does not mean all the other characters don't contribute, they do, they have they share of funny scenes. But just as there's some good scenes worth of a laugh, there's some depressing ones, they are just so well balanced I love it, it's perfect. The main character usually shows a great honesty that if found charming, because he uses some sarcastic remarks sometimes and it is straightforward most of the time. That is what this differences from any other CBI show, and I should say the acting... it's is amazing. All the main cast members are outstanding by their acting, and the cases are really good written. I would recommend this show to anyone, I am looking forward to watching the next season! This show is worth the time and money! Also just to point something out, this is the ONLY show that has gotten my attention until now, that's how awesome it is... not saying that you'll definitively like it, but I recommend it.  (:

0307956350|1.0|I am in the financial industry and looked forward to another author creating mysteries related to the industry. I was terribly disappointed and forced myself to finish the book -- something I rarely have to do. The plot and outcomes are obvious; the depiction of banks and the world of money is so far removed from reality I could not suspend disbelief when reading the book; and the author's constant placement of his own voice, masked as the thoughts of the protagonist, was downright annoying. I myself have written a book, I am very respectful of new authors but the bottom line is stay away, a poorly written book all the way around.

B005ETA5K2|5.0|I purchased this unit because of all the great reviews and recommendations. When I received the unit, unfortunately I didn't know how to set it up with my mac and was having problems with the setup process that was described. The setup on my computer was a bit different than the instructions I was given. I contacted their online support and though there seemed to be a bit of a language barrier... I eventually worked it out with their help and got the unit functioning. I was now picking up at least 15 more signals than my built in wireless and even the weakest signals that were barely read originally.. were now 80-90% with the alfa. Although, I was still having issues with my specific unit dropping connection on my laptop, so I contacted Alfa once again and was quickly offered an RMA to send the unit into their service center for diagnosis. In the meantime I purchased a similar unit from Frys Electronics which was made by a different big name brand.. and it didn't work at all. Actually none of the external units I have tried worked for anything on my Macbook Pro but at least the Alfa was getting me connected! Plus it works flawlessly on my other computer which is a desktop mac G5.<br /><br />Turns out that I have an issue with my Macbook and compatibility with external units. The service center has been very good with communication and they have responded quickly, vs waiting for weeks to even getting worked on with other RMA's with different companies I have had in the past. They have offered me a bunch of solutions including swapping out my unit for a different model that may have better compatibility with my computer and even offering me direct remote troubleshooting on my computer over the net. I am very satisfied with Alfa's service center and wouldn't hesitate in the future to buy from them again.
0440242401|5.0|I am a senior in high school and I chose this book for an english paper I had to write. I figured it would be a good book because of Sophie Kinsella's other hilarious reads and believe me it was funny, but the romance was very intriguing. Lexi's perfect life she supposedly had, had become this stress to her throughout the book and she truly found herself when she was with Jon and her old friends. She became her old self and I formed new relationships with old people. I loved watching her relationship grow with Jon and Fi finding the good things about her even though she was a total bitch after landing a dream job as the boss of flooring department at a major company. Although her husband and old life didn't work for her she found a way to turn it around. It's definitely on the top ten!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really found myself struggling to get through this book.  I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy, but found the last two (this one included) to be a little slow.  There were many times reading this book that I felt as though I was trying to rush through to hopefully get to some more exciting part (that never really came).  I feel like the author had an interesting idea with the Hunger Games, but sort of ran out of steam in the subsequent books and didn't know quite where to go with the story.  I couldn't say I recommend this book, but I do look forward to seeing the movie adaptations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app out there!  Incredible number of languages and translations. Great breadth of reading plans and study options, and I haven't seen a denominational agenda - just the Word, as conveniently presented as possible.
0307474275|5.0|This is one of those rare books that captures your attention immediately and is hard to put down!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it very entertaining.  I know this is a lot of controversy around this book (which is true of anything dealing with religion), but whether you agree with the concepts--it's definitely a good read!
B0073CNGCC|5.0|Fell in love with Downton Abbey, just like tons of other people. Got caught up by watching online (I\\"d missed the whole first season.)  Found I could watch some of it for free on PBS, and then also with Netflix but when I couldn't find what I needed, I purchased an episode from AMAZON.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I've been a Madonna fan since she first started out, excitedly saving my allowance to buy the \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Madonna\\" albums. Now at nearly 40, I still hold a soft spot for her in my heart, and picked this one up the day it was released. I've listened to it a couple times and have to say I'm enjoying it. It's leagues better than \\"Hard Candy,\\" which I never warmed to. This one isn't an instant classic in my book, but it's a pretty good piece of pop froth. It sort of sounds like a Madonna with influences from her \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" albums, plus touches of Daft Punk and Goldfrapp and a sprinkle of early 1980s Depeche Mode. Most of it is good housecleaning music (and I mean that as a compliment since it does make me want to move) since it's energetic, if not exactly groundbreaking. Good hooks are throughout -- \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"I Don't Give A\\" are fun, and there are a couple pretty moments, the sweet \\"Falling Free\\" comes to mind, and makes me wish she'd tread that musical path a bit more. There are some corny moments, too -- she raps lightly and has some exceedingly simple rhymes -- I'd hope for more profound lyrics from a 53-year-old -- but it's whipped cream. You can't live on it, but it adds a splash of joy to the day. And for that I'm happy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoyed the game. It is easy to use and fun. I would recommend this solitaire game to anybody who likes card games.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna returns to fantastic form with this high-octane, bouncy club-thumping album. Masterpiece, Turn Up the Radio and Love Spent are amazing and no one can resist chair-dancing along to Girl Gone Wild and Give Me All Your Luvin'! MDNA = Perfect pop!
B000641Z90|5.0|Execellent, like having a front row seat. Fantastic concert. It was everything I hoped it would be and then some.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was fast moving and interesting. Great plot..reminded me of \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" by Lionel Shriver. I am now interested in other Landay novels..any suggestions?
B0067R0APK|3.0|OK app, but very slow response time. Also cannot see how to remove a location once its been added ... it never leaves and the gets bigger and bigger.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i started by playing Quell Reflect, so the first few levels of Quell were very easy ~ but the challenges grow, and the logic &amp; reasoning skills required do as well.  these two apps are perfect for taking some 'down time' but not being brainless.  Exercise the left side of the brain!
B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna proves once again that she is the Queen of Re-invention.  MDNA sounds original and fun -- it just screams \\"tour\\". Her voice is strong and unmistakeably Madonna the artist I grew up listening to. This is a spectacular CD and should turn out some great remixes too.
1612130283|5.0|This book trilogy is amazing!! There is not a moment that this book did not hold my attention. It is getting attention because of all the sex stuff but there really is a great story here. If you read this book please do yourself a favor and read the last two.  Trust me you will not be disapointed! After reading the last book I felt satisfied with the ending. At the end of book three there is a chapter,written in Christians view, of his first meeting with Ana. It is great!! That would be another book I would read!! Don't hesitate to read these book because I know you will not be dissapointed.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Well worth the purchase price. There's a reason it stays near the top of the sales charts. I can unhestatingly recommend this game to anyone who asks.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I saw the movie on TV some time ago, and loved reliving it by reading the book.  John Grisham never lets me down.  He writes books that I can't put down from beginning to end whatever the subject is.
B00702MUYA|5.0|I have been a fan for years but not a worship at his altar type until a year ago when he performed at the Paramount in Oakland, CA.  You could hear a pin drop, the woman next to me cried through the entire performance, the acoustics were superb and he was on the money.<br /><br />Four of us believe it was the best concert we've ever seen and we've been to hundreds. This man still creates, performs, endures, laughs, cries, and most of all sings.<br /><br />He is our global national treasure. Let's enjoy him while we still can.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book kept my interest from page 1, and the legal gargin is written in such a way that you can understand it.  John Grisham has another hit on his hands.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was recommended by my sister so I ended up getting the trilogy since the movie was coming out.  The beginning of the book was a slow read for me but as soon as the games began it was on!!!<br />I was exited about the challenges they had to face.  The relationship between Peeta and Katniss what was to come of it?  The shock at the end just when you thought it was ova.  Oh my couldn't wait to read the Sequel!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I have to start out by saying I might have been one of the most unwilling people to accept the fact that Andy would no longer be Spartacus. Liam definitely had a tough task in front of him. Unfairly to him... i'm sure a lot of fans like me were pretty harsh at the beginning.  He couldn't have handled himself or the situation he was put in any better in my opinion.<br /><br />All of that said...Liam does an exceptional job and carries the role extremely well.  It's been great to see how all the characters have progressed this season.<br /><br />The second season is fantastic and I never miss an episode.  I can't wait to see where they go with season 3 and implement Julius Ceasar into the mix!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie is really cute.  It is a good way to introduce the reality of poaching to children without being too in their face or violent about it.
0811879631|5.0|If you love Pixar and their movies, get this book. Simple as that. You wont regret it.<br /><br />The art is fantastic and the stories are very interesting. A must own.
B007ORV092|3.0|My Amazon Instant Video experience was fair. I downloaded the show to my TiVo Premier via an Ethernet cable connected to Comcast/Xfinity 25/5 mbps internet service.  My TiVo Premiere is connected to a Pioneer Elite SC-25 receiver and a 58\\" Samsung 1080p plasma monitor.  All components are connected via HDMI cables.  Enough techno babble.<br /><br />We had about 12 hiccups on the \\"high definition\\" video stream and one drop out in the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack. The video drop outs lasted about one second of screen time each and only affected portions of the screen. The worst was when the bottom half of the screen was obscured for about four seconds during Don and Megan's pillow talk on the floor of the apartment. I am not sure what bit rate was, but it looked like a good DVD to me. I am a cord cutter so I cannot compare it directly to my old Verizon FIOS feed.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the experience and the $2.84 per episode season pass with no commercial interruptions, but there is room for improvement of the picture and sound quality.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I was kind of blind sided too re: this movie.  I never realized this was a true story and thought it was just another hokey human interest script that Sandra Bullock was so good in, she won the Oscar.  Then I learned it was a true life story, which stirred my curiosity and interest so I decided to get it.  So glad I did.  As most of the rest of the world was able to figure out, this is an excellent movie and a really sweet story.  I'm so glad things worked out for him!  Very inspiring story and the Oscar was well-deserved.  I would present one to everybody involved in this movie!
0756405890|5.0|This past year I have dedicated my reading to new authors. Not necessarily debut authors, but authors I have not read before. I started my fantasy reading spree with THE BONE SWORD, LEGENDS REBORN (The Light of Epertase series) and KING'S ENVOY (Artesans of Albia series). I then widened it to some popular authors like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan. Now here I am reading back to reading another debut by Patrick Rothfuss.<br /><br />I loved it, I am hooked.  The best part of THE NAME OF THE WIND is the magic. I thought that it was stunning. Simply rooted into the world rather than thrown in as an afterthought. The characters are incredible, the main character being a master storyteller. Often it is hard for an author to write a story within a story like that, but Rothfuss achieved it seamlessly.<br /><br />Many authors have trouble foreshadowing events. In `The Name of the Wind' there is no problem the author did it perfectly.  I love how the hints build up and build up until we know everything that the character has known throughout the book. It was a creative and well-crafted method of storytelling.<br /><br />This book is by far one of the best books I have ever read. You should read it too.
B006YXKLV0|5.0|*might contain spoilers*<br /><br />I love any & all Chipmunk movies - especially since I'm pretty sure I own all of them (& I don't mean just the 3 newest ones). I've been a fan of theirs since I was a year old - so for 27yrs now I've loved these guys.<br /><br />I loved this movie, because there's a whole lot of Simon in it & he's my favourite by far. I love Alvin & Theodore too, but Simon is my Chipmunk. I like Jeanette having a bigger part as well - always liked her since she got Simon & kind of reminds me of me sometimes.<br /><br />I could've done without the 'Castaway' part of it - that chick with the balls as friends was pointless to me. And my biggest issue with this movie - why do the Chipettes sing on every song??? The Chipmunks don't have a single song to themselves & the movie is \\"Alvin & The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked\\" NOT \\"The Chipettes Movie\\". It angers me a little that it feels like the Chipettes are slowly taking over. Yeah, I like them well enough, but c'mon. There's no reason for them to sing on every song & have songs to themselves, when The Chipmunks only get shared songs. The Chipmunks deserve to have plenty of songs to themselves, since they ARE the true stars & not the Chipettes. And some of the song choices....I get they're trying to keep with the times, but couldn't they throw in a couple 90's songs or 60's songs for us older fans? We're not all fans of Katy Perry & Lady Gaga here.<br /><br />I gave this movie a 5 though, because despite my frustration above, I love Simon getting lot of attention. I also loved Alvin's role in it all - I felt awful for him, when he thought Dave didn't love him enough to look for him. I like that they showed his sensitive side.<br /><br />I would reccommend this movie to anyone, since I'm a die-hard fan of The Chipmunks.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Been waiting to purchase this and glad i locked it in at $69.99. Season two started off slow but sure did come back strong in the second half. Season three is going to be amazing!  The prison, michonne, and a very sadistic governor...not sure how they are going to keep it TVMA but can't wait
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Thank God I didn't pay for this book.  What the heck are we thinking as a society?  Children killing children for adult sport?  REALLY?  And this is popular!!!  This is garbage.  Badly written garbage.  The 'first person present tense' style of writing is tedious and awkward, the storyline is crazy junk, the execution (no pun intended) is sadly lacking.  The Hunger Games is the beginning of the demise of the literary world.  Remember when literary excellence was an achievement and classic novels were born out of good writing?  With Hunger Games we are looking at the beginning of sicko garbage becoming mainstream classics that our kids are forced to read in class.  Suzanne Collins has no morals, and neither does Scholastic.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great for keeping my food journal. easy to add pics of my food. and easier to send to my nutritionist
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like dis game a lot. I think it is fun. people should atleast try this first. I hav fun playing these games
B004HO6I4M|5.0|had to have this movie--we heard great reviews from friends with parrots.  so being good parrot parents, we added it to our collection.
B005RUV6RO|2.0|I must admit that season 1 was without doubt one of my all time favorite shows. However season 2 has left me feeling like I could care less if the show returns for season 3. I have tried to like it but the lack of action, especially in the middle of the season, has turned the show into a soap opera \\"drama fest\\". Also, the shows less than stellar writing has me disliking more than half of the characters.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Its different than with the Ipad you have to manually move the screen. But if you know where north south east and west is it works perfectly. I love this app and have already talked all my friends and family into buying it :)
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Relive the past with this great old movie. I recognized many scenes that influenced later sci-fi movies such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Lost in Space and others. For being filmed 50+ years ago, this movie is still on of the best.
145162445X|5.0|A very fascinating read. I enjoy books like these because they make you aware of science's best attempt at an accurate picture of reality. This is important because so much philosophy is based off of antiquated paradigms that have little in common with our universe as currently understood. The afterword by Richard Dawkins really put the book's significance into context.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this game so much its awesomely fantastically amazing and i don't know what i would do without it AWESOME GAME YOU DEFFINATELY NEED IT
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is my favorite game for the Kindle Fire.  The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and the music is perfect.  The best dollar I ever spent.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel by William Landay is an excellent novel about the American justice system and the families of alleged criminals. The novel is written from the father's viewpoint, and the reader is  swept up into his emotions as a father and a prosecutor. The ending is riveting.  I highly recommend this novel.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Incredible book - a very revealing and personal account of a young woman hiking the Pacific crest Trail solo wholly unprepared for the journey and the spiritual transformation that lay ahead. The book will be enjoyed by the ladies since it is told with a distinctive, feminine introspection, It will make the reader cry, laugh and cry again. Men will like it due to the well written first-hand accounts of the trail with all its hardships. Clearly Cheryl Strayed is an extraordinary person; she overcame the severe punishment dished out by the trail with a determination and dogged tenacity that few of us have.  In my mind, she's a kick-@ss Amazonian queen. There aren't many real life examples of the strength of the human spirit but this one is sterling. Buy the book. It's written in an easy manner that you won't put down. If you are considering hiking the PCT, backpacking, or just like a good story , this is a must read.
B003JTHESA|2.0|Before I fall victim to an unfair flame war, let me assure you that I've been a loyal Iron Maiden fan for over 25 years. I have every single album they've ever recorded, I own the videos, the singles, the t-shirts, the posters, the flags, the video game and I've seen them live on numerous occasions. Yes, I know every single song by heart and can sing along to 99% of them. Like any other self respecting Iron Maiden fan. Yes, I've read the official biography more than once and can even quote whole passages from it.<br /><br />Why am I saying all that? Well, for a very simple reason. Criticizing Iron Maiden is no small feat. It is not easy to criticize a band that has a career spanning over 30 years and a band that has made some of the best heavy metal albums you could ever hope to listen to. So I felt I needed to prove my never-ending love for Iron Maiden before I dared to commit heresy and say that Iron Maiden made an overlong and boring album.<br /><br />You see, I'm such a fanboy that I will even defend The X Factor and Virtual XI. But my loyalty to Iron Maiden does not cloud my judgment and does not keep me from admitting that with The Final Frontier Iron Maiden has hit rock-bottom in terms of writing music.<br /><br />Now, I will not launch into a detailed analysis of every note or riff played on this album, because I am not a musician and I lack the theoretical knowledge to do so. So I just can't talk about musical composition. I cannot criticize their use of scales or harmonies. However, I can speak as a fan and I will tell you how I feel when I listen to these songs. I can tell you about what sounds right and wrong. I can tell you about what is exciting and what's dull, annoying and repetitive. That I can do.<br /><br />You see, I don't think you need to be a composer to criticize music. Of course, if I were a musician, I could hit the nail on the head and give you a list of theoretical reasons why The Final Frontier is not a good album. But every single fan out there has an instinct that tells him/her if an album is good or bad. We may not be able to explain why, but we know. Oh, yes. We do.<br /><br />Let's start, shall we?<br /><br />My first pet peeve with The Final Frontier is that the songs are unnecessarily overlong and this is a trend we have witnessed since Iron Maiden released Dance of Death back in 2003.<br /><br />I don't have anything against long songs, as long as the song really needs to be long. For instance, if you're telling a complex story that requires more than 6 or 7 minutes to be told. Remember The Rime of The Ancient Mariner? Or if the song is interesting enough, from a musical point of view, to keep your attention. And by that I mean if the song is dynamic and exciting, like The Thin Line Between Love and Hate, with its glorious chorus and fast pace, or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, with its amazing guitar solos.<br /><br />The problem with most of the songs on The Final Frontier is that you feel the band now writes long songs just for the sake of writing long songs. Granted, Mother of Mercy, Coming Home and The Alchemist clock in at less than 6 minutes, but you can't say the same about the rest of the album, which feels repetitive and flat. Songs like The Man Who Would Be King or When The Wild Wind Blows are perfect examples of this. There's nothing really exciting going on. They're tedious songs. Period. Gone are the catchy choruses and the amazing hooks.<br /><br />Now it's all about being epic. Hey, Steve. Guess what? Not every song has to be epic. There was a time when you were into writing catchy tunes like Flight of Icarus or Wasted Years. Whatever happened to writing songs your fans could sing along to? The fact that you can write long songs doesn't mean that you have to. Keep it simple and be epic if you really need to.<br /><br />I feel Iron Maiden has chosen a path that will ultimately lead to their musical demise. Whereas in the past their albums were full of glorious and thunderous metal songs and your occasional epic tune to balance things out, now it's the other way around. And the result is a band that plays on autopilot and merely goes through the motions and that no longer writes memorable songs. I bet you'd be hard-pressed to find a single Maiden fan that actually believes The Final Frontier surpasses their early efforts.<br /><br />If all your songs start out slow and then pick up the pace, aren't you on autopilot? If all your songs have 3,000,000 time changes, aren't you on autopilot? If all your guitar players have at least 1 solo per song and they must all play a solo, because hey we have 3 guitar players and they have to do something besides playing riffs, aren't you on autopilot?<br /><br />And I have to say this. Did we really need another Iron Maiden album? I am not so sure. In spite of being a huge fan, I feel Iron Maiden no longer has anything to give in musical terms. They've already achieved greatness and they will never surpass what they did back in the early days. All they are doing now is repeating themselves over and over again and that's what I'm afraid of. Unless their next album is really exciting, because I'm 100% sure there'll be another album, the band will keep being the target of criticism. Wouldn't it have been better if they had retired right after Dance of Death? I really think so. Because AMOLAD was nothing to write home about either. It was another over-indulgent album with long songs and repetitive riffs and songs that seemed to be going nowhere. And then you get the obligatory live album and live DVD and Greatest Hits... (Yawn).<br /><br />You have to know when to stop. Maybe it is about time Steve Harris & Co. called it a day. It has indeed been a great ride, but enough is enough.etal songs and your occasional epic tune to balance things out, now it's the other way around.

0061673730|4.0|An incredibly touching search for self, made doubly so by life experiences no one should be forced to endure.  The horrors of ECT revealed - a man cleaved in two, one forced to retrace a path from a previous life spent defining quality, hoping to find out who his former self, Phaedrus might have been.  The damage done to a sensitive intelligent person - a modern tragedy.  One that further compels me to expose the travesty of what passes for \\"mental health\\" care in a modern age.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is great! it does what it says and has some cool features, like you can photos and things like that to your notes
B007P3TMW2|3.0|The words coming out of the mouth of Oscar Schell are too much like literature and much less like a kid talking, whatever the traumatic circumstances or special nature of his intellect.  Because he is a distant character, rather than empathizing with him, there were times I wanted to say to him, \\"Quit being a brat!\\"  He gets away with too much or maybe the part is just poorly written:  so obvious that he is saying to his mother what will hurt because he is hurting.  But so is everyone around him.  Sandra Bullock plays a fine, quiet and sympathetic role, long suffering her way through her husband's sudden death and the after math.  Tom Hanks is so idealized in his role there isn't a single person on this earth who wouldn't die a thousand times over in losing him.  The grandmother is one-dimensional and seemingly without much feeling except for one of protectiveness and availability to her grandson.  A relationship between she and her daughter in law does not seem to exist at all.  Overall, the screenplay is spotty and this topic, dramatized many times before and specific to this historic moment, has been much better explored in other films.  It is too bad:  so much talent, such poor writing evocative of a Nicolas Sparks' novel in trying to elicit as many hankies wet as possible by the end.  Maybe that was its purpose:  let's watch this movie and cry, cry a lot.
B007MG360G|5.0|this game is awesome. you mix animals with other animals and you get another animal to mix with some other one.there are a lot of combos almost 150 to mix. buy if you like a gooooood puzzle!!!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I had to give it a two because I have had fun with it.  It should now be a 0.  My Asus upgraded to A 4.02 and now it freezes.  After many hours of work.  grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br />Why would Amazon carry it when they know it will not work on ICS??
B001TWT0AE|5.0|Unfortunately,they don't make great movies like this classic<br />John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart classic.<br />Great story,great acting,I highly recommend this movie.
0061119776|3.0|I don't really think the description of this item is clear enough, yes it says big book, but I thought that meant the regular size hardbook style book, not a HUGE, oversized floppy book.  I do not like it and I can't stand that I have to pay Amazon to ship it back.  They should have free returns!
1612130283|1.0|I tried a free sample for my Kindle and found the writing so painfully bad it made me glad I didn't waste my money on the complete book. As earlier reviewers have noted, if you are looking for well-written bondage/SM erotica, try Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to get swept up in the hunger games phenonenom and read the 1st book.  I read it in about 3 days.  If I didnt have work in there it probably would have been 1. It is a very easy read.  It keeps you captivated and the basic language and grammar is lower level.  I still really liked the book, yes, I think it is meant to be for high schoolers but hey, it was pretty good! Definately recommend it for a nice, easy read for a weekend or vacation.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|I was expecting to be disgusted by this film after being enamored of the original that was so true to the book.  The opening sequence was just bizarre.  James Bond meets Alien?  What did this have to do with the book or the resultant film?<br /><br />The actual film surprised me initially.  Daniel Craig was of course excellent.  Rooney Mara vastly exceeded my expectations but did not captivate me as did Noomi Rapace.<br /><br />Although the cinematography & the set details were excellent overall, the lighting, the flatness of it, disturbed me as it did not contribute appropriately.<br /><br />Not the failure I expected but not an overall excellent film.  Although this was a good film, the original still excels.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Simply put this book is amazing. It totally sucked me in,and I had to force myself to put it down sometimes. The amount of thinking and intrigue in this book is staggering in my opinion, and makes you want to keep reading to discover the answers. I heard a lot of hype about this book, and I have to say I agree with all of it. This is one of the best books I've read, and anyone who likes computer sci-fi should seriously consider reading this book. Your missing out if you don't.
0525423656|4.0|Personally, I liked the first book better... but this book does have some good twists and turns, which makes me want to read the third book in this trilogy all the more.<br /><br />Some of the action sequences were hard to picture for me.  Same goes with the location descriptions.  But, the new information about the society and anti-society were enlightening and interesting.  I find myself comparing this love triangle to Hunger Games and Twilight.  I keep wondering who Cassia will end up with.  And I'm looking forward to learning more about society came to be the way it is now in this book.<br /><br />Definitely a good read and an enjoyable trilogy.
1401228801|5.0|I took the advice of the many Amazon reviewers, and entirely skipped Volume 13 ([[ASIN:1401225721 The Great Fables Crossover]]), jumping right into this one after reading [[ASIN:1401223168 The Dark Ages]].  Without noticing any hiccups, the story continued right along its prior trajectory, expanding the post-Adversary story-arc.  Skipping Volume 13 seems like it was a good decision, as I really didn't want to go back and read the Jack-of-Fables series (which I've briefly experienced and which consistently receive mediocre reviews), and the story seemed to pick up right where Volume 12 left off.<br /><br />The second major storyarc of the Fables universe is well underway now, with NYC-based Fabletown in complete ruin and the Dark Man taking up residence in the ruins.  The conflict between the ex-pat Fables and the Dark Man is sure to be an epic one, and is only just beginning to take shape here.  Bigby and Co. are making tentative plans, and the Fabletown witches are getting organized, but most of this story will be told in later volumes.  WITCHES focuses mostly on the Dark Man's back-story and the showdown between Bufkin and Baba Yaga, both of whom are trapped in the old Homelands office building.  While that may not seem at first to be much of a match, you'll be surprised by Bufkin's resourcefulness.  Also here is the beginnings of a power struggle within the Thirteenth Floor witches, culminating in a showdown between Ozma and Gepetto (emerging now as a serious player in Fabletown politics). Finally, this volume ends with a story highlighting the sorts of troubles Flycatcher will confront in trying to govern a kingdom made up of such a diverse group of inhabitants, from Goblins to Talking Squirrels.<br /><br />To me, this volume represents some of the best storytelling of the entire series.  Old characters continue to grow and new ones are just being developed.  While the focus of the story has seriously shifted, the sense of impending doom is probably even greater now, and the story still feels like it is going somewhere.  I for one am glad the story didn't end with the freeing of the Homelands and the defeat of the Adversary!<br /><br />Highly recommended.now, and the story still feels like it is going somewhere.  I for one am glad the story didn't end with the freeing of the Homelands and the defeat of the Adversary!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1451627289|4.0|I guess changing the past could turn out in several different ways.  And none of the options in my head were the direction Stephen King went with this book, which made it more interesting and appealing.<br /><br />I found the characters in Jodie, Texas, much more fun then the time spent chasing Oswald.  The descriptions of life in the 50's were amusing.  And even though the book didn't end the way I was hoping it would, it was a good read.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the book was so long that when he referenced characters from the first hundred pages during the last hundred pages, it was difficult to remember who that character was and I found myself flipping back sometimes to connect the dots.
1466401885|2.0|First off, I was really excited to read this book. I was looking for something less heavy than what I have been reading. I read a million reviews and decided that this would be my next book.<br /><br />I really wanted to read The 50 Shades as I have never read anything very steamy, but I refuse to pay that much for an e-book.<br /><br />Anyway, I feel like the whole story has been told over and over and over again. Shy girl wins bad boy's affection. Shy girl laments, can she change him? ect. That's ok. Then I read that there were some STEAMY love scenes...ummm not really. Steamy to a middle school virgin? Maybe. But to any non-virgin? I can't imagine.<br /><br />Also, the premise that Abby is an 19 year old girl who has NEVER been touched and then just plunges in to the loss of virginity is silliness.<br /><br />All in all, I was very disappointed in the book. It was barely entertaining, contained no surprises, wasn't romantic, and basically described every high school/college romance.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|It works well on my kindle, and a great way to pass the time. Others in my household also like it very much.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|this app is awesome. I see there is an update in the android market adding video support. that's what I've been waiting for. hopefully you guys have already submitted it to amazon. I know it takes about a week or so to be approved. but that's why the amazon appstore is a much safer place.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Having been cajoled into watching the first series of Downton Abbey, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I thought I'd see what the recent BBC Upstairs Downstairs series was like. Having never seen LWT's original version on the UK's ITV in the 1970s, this was something new to me.<br />The three episodes are fantastic. The period detail seemed excellent. I particularly enjoyed the Fascist storyline in the show and the appearance of Mrs Simpson and the discussion of the possibility of an Abdication which certainly held my attention, attaching the fictional storylines in the show to actual events occuring at the time.<br />A wonderful cast where every member performs equally well, I was particulary impressed with Neil Jackson as chauffeur Henry Spargo.<br />Looking forward to the next series!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This product is just great. First time I have ever owned a turtle beach headset and I don't regret buying it at all. The sound is just amazing. I really like the fact you can adjust the volume for either the game or the chat. No need to go through the trouble of going through each name of the person and mute them. Adjusting the bass of the game is a definite plus. Makes you feel like you are really in the game. Only problem I would have to say is that when characters in the game are talking, their voices echo. But like I said, it's my first time owning this kind of headset so I'm not exactly sure if that's how it always is. But overall, this product is great. I would recommend this to anyone.

B003O86FMW|4.0|The middle book of the Hunger Games trilogy has many good things going for it but it's also stretched with padding, a lot of repetitive scenes, and it's not written with quite the same degree of snap and crispness of the first. The author does paint a solid picture of cruel, totalitarian oppression, nonsensically missing from the first book, but there are still a few times when she writes things that don't ring true. For example: the oppressed citizens of Panem are bloodthirsty spectators who get bored unless they see blood and guts in the games. In a real life setting, surely the only blood that would stir the television audience is the blood and guts of the peacekeepers, and the sadistic president, not their own brothers and sisters.<br /><br />I was also a bit confused at the end of this book, when katniss fails to grasp the importance of the events taking place. She comes off as selfish and unlikable and not even particularly smart.  In a couple of pages, the author manages to kill off two books' worth of character building.<br /><br />As stated, the book does have many good things going for it. The story moves in the direction of the uprising and District 13 and many pots have been opened and now I'd like to look inside those pots, which means I'll have to open Mockingjay, book 3. I admit I'm hooked. I'd like to know why President Snow's breath smells of blood, I'd like to know if Cenna and Peeta and Johanna live on, and I'd like to see one last game where all the bad guys, especially the blood guzzling president, get a dose of their own devices. Will I or won't I be treated to all that in the big finish? Tis the question.<br /><br />Final words:  Some of my criticisms may seem harsh, but I still have the utmost respect for the skill and talent Suzanne Collins displays in her Hunger Games.

1409136612|4.0|Maeve Binchy's new book FULL HOUSE is classified as a quick read and is perfect for a lazy afternoon.  Once again she has \\"hit the nail on the head\\" with her latest offering that presents the story of the Nolan family, whose household could be a microcosm of many of the families in our world today.  We have hard working loving parents, doing whatever it takes maintain their home which is overrun with their adult children who feel their parents should be thrilled to have them underfoot.  Like many children in this era of entitlement, they contribute little or nothing to the household, are demanding and tend to treat their mother like a maid, pay no rent, and in general behave like spoiled brats.<br /><br />When her husband Liam loses his job mom, Dee, decides it's time to make changes in the status quo and her overindulged children are a good place to start.<br /><br />Filled with the cozy, warm storytelling style that is a Binchy trademark, FULL HOUSE, while not a full course meal, should serve as a satisfying little \\"nosh\\" for her many fans.

1451627289|3.0|I have never read a Stephen King book before.  I'm not a horror fan, so I have avoided them.  When I read the premise of this book, I was hooked.  Travel back through time to stop the murder of JFK?  I'm in.<br /><br />And I loved the covers.  The front cover shows the newspaper from the day Kennedy was killed.  On the back is an alternative cover, showing Kennedy survived. Cool.<br /><br />The first third of the book was really good, and moved fairly rapidly.  Interesting ideas, and well presented.<br /><br />The middle third dragged terribly, as we waited five years for the fateful day.  Oh, things happened, but overall it was dull.  I barely made it through the middle third.<br /><br />The last third of the book picked up again, and I liked it better again.<br /><br />I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone I know, though I did when I was in the first third.  It's simply too long.  This story could have been told within about 550 pages, and that's what it should have been.  Instead, it went on for 850 pages, and dragged.

B00756GKBA|5.0|After letting this album sink in, I am ready to write my review. \\"Give Me All Your Lovin\\" was the first single released from, \\"MDNA,\\" and released too mixed reviews. However, I was instantly a fan of the song, but not blown away. Then the little snippits came on Facebook. Again, I was not ecstatic, and thought, \\"Where are the hits?\\" Then yesterday I downloaded the mp3 version, while I am waiting for my deluxe version to arrive in the mail. Well, after hearing the complete cd, I can honestly say that I am blown away. Every song on this CD has hit potential. There is a wide diverse amount of songs, that Madonna takes us on an ever changing musical journey here. My favorites in order are as follows:<br />1. Gang Bang- The best, yet strangest song on the cd. Madonna speaks about shooting someone in the head and killing them dead. With an infectious beat and catchy chorus, Gang Bang is by far destined to be a club and Pop hit.<br />2. Girl Gone Wild- The second release. Opens the album with a hard pounding beat and gets you in the mood to get up and dance. Full of energy and again catchy chorus.<br />3. Love Spent- I woke up today with this track stuck in my head, \\"Love Spent, Give me Love Spent...\\" Classic Madonna Pop song here. One of the few songs here inteed for Mr. Guy Ritchie. Radio Ready and destined to be a relase.<br />4. Turn Up The Radio- Hard dance beats meets old style Madonna. A Pop/Dance song with commercial appeal. I am sure this will be released.<br />5. I Don't Give A- I love this song. This is the most hip hop song on the album, however, Madonna and producers do an excellent job with putting this together and coming up a very catchy hook that plays over and over in the back of my head. I love the way this song was produced and will be a commercial success.<br />6. Give Me All Your Lovin- First release. I personally love this song, but it is different than the other songs here.<br />Those are my predictions on the releases of songs.<br /><br />Thees following songs are also excellent, however, I can't possibly see Madonna releasing all of these songs:<br />I'm Addicted- Madonna speaks of her MDNA. I am addicted to this dance song. I'm a Sinner- It seems like Madonna is a lot of things, and a sinner is one of them. Speaks of all the Saints, and how everyone sins. This is another one that gets stuck in my head. Superstar- Madonna takes us back like she did with \\"Cherish\\" and \\"True Blue\\".  This may be a release. It could be because it does have commercial and radio appeal. Masterpiece- is a beautiful song from her movie, \\"We.\\" Beautiful enchanting melody is a nice ediditon to this album.<br />Now my least favorite songs, however, still good songs in my book are: Some Girls- Good Dance auto tuned song. Don't hear the commercial appeal here. More like a b side to me. Falling Free- ends the album with this song. My least favorite song here. No commercial appeal here.<br /><br />Now for the bonus tracks on the Deluxe Edition.<br />In my opinion these songs are just as good, if not better than some on the album.<br />1. Beautiful Killer- I love this song. It has that old Madonna style with a club/dance beat. She could have released this song first and I am sure it would have been a hit. My favotire.<br />2. I Blanked up- can't say the real word here. This is a beautiful Madonna song, however, I would not have used the curse word. Madonna being a bad girl again.<br />3. B-Day Song- I don't know what it is that I like most about this silly song. It is a simple song, but a fun song that gets me singing along and clapping my hands. I really like it.<br />4. Best Friends- I hated this song when I first heard it, however, it grew on me. It starts off weird but then transforms into a nice torch song for Mr. Guy Ritchie again.<br /><br />All in all I have to say that this is an Amazing Album. Madonna proves that she has still got it. It is Pop. It is Dance. It is Club. It is Commercial. It is everything you would want from Madonna, and so much more. I predict a Grammy or two here. Madonna lets us all know that she is the Queen, and the Queen Is Back!!!! I'm Addicted to this Masterpiece!

But the video ads that pop out into your face almost every time you start a new hand is so annoying.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion Bible app is by far the best app on the Android Market.  The UI is extremely innovative, sleek and modern.  The best part of the app though, IMHO is the 100+ daily devotionals to choose from, the ability to have the verses read to you and the 10+ Bible versions to choose from.  And everything is included FREE!  This will be a great aid in getting me back on track in reading and delving into Scripture like I should be.  TWO THUMBS UP!  God bless the developers of this app!

0439023513|2.0|Of course the first book  - our introduction to the Hunger Games, ended as a cliff hanger.  Actually each chapter was a cliff hanger  - I couldn't put it down.  The second was only slightly diminished but with a very nice twist at the end leaving me wanting more.  Then the third, which have some have shared is much darker - especially as the characters we have come to love have become jaded and \\"hijacked' by the war.  But - to be honest - this is a subject about war and power and those most vulnerable - and it tells this story well.<br /><br />Until the end, when it feels like, for the sake of brevity, the book comes to a climatic, then anti-climatic end, with loose ends that get tied up roughly rather than in the meticulous fashion of the first two books.  I won't spoil the ending.  I think the climatic ending has merits, but was never fully explained.  The anti-climatic ending will have readers disappointed though - not because of how the story ultimately ends, but in the process to get to that ending.<br /><br />There, hope  I didn't spoil the ending for anyone.
B001NLKZUA|1.0|I'm not much for YA fantasy (or any kind of fantasy, really) but occassionally [sic] I'll read one. Why? Because I'm a bloody masochist, that's why. How else can you explain it?<br /><br />So I started to read, expecting plucky, beautiful teenagers overcoming all obstacles with ease, and, after some contrived drama, a heartfelt plea to buy the next book.<br /><br />That's about what I got.<br /><br />Now, I was given to understand that this book contains both a Jewish character and a gay character. Since I am both, I was ready to do some major relating. In other words, I wanted to see what a hash the author would make out of<br /><br />a) the Jewish religion<br /><br />b) the trauma that comes with realizing what you are, and then actually having to tell people<br /><br />I suspected Ms Clare would maul both concepts, being (to my knowledge) neither Jewish nor a gay male. I was right.<br /><br />The Jewish fellow seemed to me to be the dark-complexioned [sic], sharp-featured, caricature of what a Jew is supposed to look like, as explained to people who had never seen a Jew before. The Nazis used a form of this caricature to great effect in the thirties.<br /><br />Now, I'm not comparing Ms Clare to the Nazis. I'm simply saying she could have made the Jew less of a stereotype. I know a heckuva lot of Jews, and I have only ever seen one who fitted her description (and was not a sabra).<br /><br />The gay guy(s) was (were) worse. One was a typical teenager, except for the fact he was inordinately beautiful, very moody, and completely useless at anything physical. How un-stereotypical!<br /><br />The other can only be described as rainbow vomit. Every gay stereotype ever was thrown together and played for laughs. But it's all okay, because he's a super-powerful wizard who steals things from normal people and then guffaws at their stupidity! I wanted to throw up.<br /><br />The Jewish guy's religion is mentioned presicely twice. This is about the amount of times it wouldcome up in real life, but what gets me about him is we know practically nothing about him, except that he's a Yid, and inordinately beautiful. And in love with the main character.<br /><br />Eventually, Reb Yid (or should I say Reb Shlimazel, because that's about all that happens to him) becomes a vampire. Now, if this had happened to me, I'd be in shock. First of all, I'd have to violate the most important commandment in the Torah: do not murder. In Jewish law, all the commandments can be violated if you're breaking them to save someone's life, EXCEPT for the one about murder.<br /><br />So Reb Yid now has to live with the fact that he's stamping on basically all morality, and being forced to be horrifically selfish (others must die so I may live). He must cope with the fact that ever attachment he'll ever make will be ripped brutally apart, as he lives while they die.He'll even have to cope with jealousy from others who wish they could live forever too.<br /><br />Now you'd expect exposition from him on his new condition. You get, instead, calm resignation. Oh well. At least he'll get to say kaddish over the grave of every single relative he'll ever have.<br /><br />Viewed from a Jewish perspective, vampirism is even more frightening. When found out, he'd be promptly excommunicated as a murderer, and his departure from the community (and, very probably, his handover to the police) would be viewed with no remorse at all.<br /><br />He'll never even come close to the Olam Ha-ba, either (olam ha-ba, or world to come, is basically retirement: after a long, full life, you can relax). He will be, literally, the Wandering Jew. He is screwed. For eternity.<br /><br />And none of this fazes him.<br /><br />If I've spent a while on the subject of these two particular characters, it's because, to me, they were the only things that merited reaction in the entire book. The rest was typical boring, cliched, teen-lit rubbish. I yawned through most of the book.<br /><br />But toreturn to my main topic: these fellows wouldn't bother me so much if they weren't simply put in to broaden the book's appeal. Why do I think this? Because they're just... there. Nothing happens to them. Reb Yid becomes a vampire, and that's nothing too. The two gay guys start a romance. Ho hum. Their characters are never developed, their motivations are never explored. They're just there.<br /><br />But all the supporting characters are like this, you argue. True, but if you're going to single two out why not actually give them lives, instead of just forcing them to be a billboard saying &#34;I'm diverse!&#34;<br /><br />In short: I hate characters like this, and to me they signify the quality of the rest of the book: outwardly intriguing (&#34;hmm, a gay guy and a Jewish guy. I wonder what they'll do with the characters!&#34;) inwardly hollow.
0307352145|5.0|This is my first endorsement of a book after many years of purchases on Amazon.  \\"Quiet\\" speaks to an under-appreciated and often overlooked slice of the American persona.  Introversion is neither a handicap nor something to \\"overcome\\", and this book takes an informed and highly analytical look at the strengths, limitations and perceptions surrounding the introvert.  Highly recommended!!!
0061726834|4.0|Lauren Oliver's Delirium is set in a future where love has been diagnosed as a disease and everyone gets the cure for this disease at 18. Originally, I thought this idea was a bit far fetched and for a long time I put off reading this book. After much urging and amazing reviews from other bloggers I finally decided to read it. And I am so upset I waited this long!<br /><br />The World building, the most important part of a dystopian book, was wonderfully done. I understood why the government closed off the borders to prevent the disease. I also understood all the reasons why Lena originally wanted the cure for love. There was no guessing as to how this future happened. Oliver does leave some pieces for the reader to put together themselves but it was not hard a small stretch of the imagination bridges these gaps.<br /><br />My favorite part of Delirium was by far the characters! I felt like every character that was introduced I got to know on a personal level. And Oliver did not suffer from disappearing friend syndrome. Hana the main character, Lena's, best friend was present throughout the entire book and played a pivotal role. So often in YA books the girl has a best friend, meets a guy and then no longer has a best friend. This always really bothers me because that isn't how it works in real life, you don't meet a guy and then bail on your friends. Fortunately Oliver masterfully weaves each of the characters into the storyline and no one, even Lena's little cousin gets lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the relationship between Lena and Alex. It was a sweet relationship that grew with the story. I liked that Alex let Lena come to her own conclusions about the government and was there for her even when it was at his own peril. Oliver really showed and didn't have to tell how much Alex and Lena care for each other.<br /><br /> I loved the attention to detail in Delirium as well. Each chapter starts with a poem, verse, or some other approved government material. It reminded me every chapter that this society just isn't right.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Delirium and after the cliffhanger it leaves you on I will definitely be picking up Pandemonium!nment material. It reminded me every chapter that this society just isn't right.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Delirium and after the cliffhanger it leaves you on I will definitely be picking up Pandemonium!
0062119044|4.0|I'm going to state this right up front. This will have spoilers. Do not read my review if you have not read the book.<br /><br />This was a hard book to read. I imagine it's not as painful for those who don't have any children. From the very beginning, I couldn't help comparing myself with the author. She described so many things that I related to. The way your body and everything you do with it becomes subject to everyone's unsolicited advice and outright policing when you're pregnant. My oldest child was challenging, like Kevin, in many ways, though less extreme. Like the narrator, my labor was long, in fact longer than her own was. I completely relate to the feelings of rejection that come with a child refusing to nurse. I understand the guilt associated with being unable to nurse. But what I could not relate to was her lack of feeling toward her infant son. And I can't help but feel that a baby would sense that, and that it would have shaped him from the very beginning. My inability to relate to this made it hard for me to sympathize with the narrator.<br /><br />While unable to bring myself to like the narrator, I quickly found Kevin unbearably annoying, and Franklin's complete indulgence and unwillingness to discipline him outright infuriating. I hated Franklin's guts, in fact, while I only mildly disliked the narrator.<br /><br />I have to say, from page one, I predicted the ending. There was a telling lack of acknowledgment of reply from Franklin in the letters. There was also no wondering why he wouldn't reply. The way she reiterated conversations to which Franklin was a party, these were all tips to me that she was writing letters to someone who was deceased. I wanted to be wrong. I desperately wanted to be wrong. In many ways I felt the author was cheating the way she left that as a surprise throughout. I was incredibly disappointed to be right.
B004BJMEO6|1.0|I don't know why I'm bothering to write a review of this movie.  Some friends brought this movie over to ask me to determine why this is not a good movie.  So we all sat around and began the movie.  When the movie started, I thought I was going to watch a documentary because of start being lesbians talking about love and soul mates.  Then one of the actors (?) starts a diatribe of who knows what and then the movie (?) starts.  This movie is a mixed up mess.  It has at inappropriate times an announcer introducing what the next scene will include with interview's about who knows what and who cares.  After the movie we watched the bonus features and apparently the lesbian director and producer believed that they produced a movie that was a great depiction of lesbian love.  I should have known what they believed was erotic when I saw on the cover of the DVD, that stated that this movie has \\"the longest kiss in Cinema history.\\"  My question to them is so what?  During this kiss the actors are slamming around the room and then they do a hard cut to a scene that has nothing related to the kissing. Additionally, the director was so proud of the love scene she directed she included a director's cut of the same scene.  My take on the scene is that the director just learned shutter cuts in movie making 101 and was trying to make an artsy sensuous love scene.  She failed.  I don't know if the actors could not preform the lesbian scene or the director thought that most of the time to have the women a couple feet away from each other barely touching and rarely kissing with a lot of hard cuts was erotic.<br />The sad part was that there was a good movie to be made, but this was a miserable failure.  The topic of the movie wasn't new and the actors did have chemistry, if only the director would have told the story of the women and left out the entire movie making 101 junk and documentary stuff.  This movie should have been given a hard \\"G\\" for the love scenes.  You can see more intense kissing in morning kids' cartoons then this movie has.  My review is that this movie was a waste of money and a mess.

B007KQXB2G|5.0|I can see why the disparity in reviews. This is not for the run-of-the-mill TV viewer or Mad Men fan. This is for creatives and freelancers. Everyone who is in a creative or freelancing arena, knows that it's a roller coaster ride. If you've been through it, you'll see some things in this episode (for lack of a much better word - it's really more of a really long promo) that will ring true and that you'll be able to connect with. Viewing this will not change your life or give you great insight to a plan of success (in the creative or other field,) but it's a nice, little \\"Cliff's Note,\\" if you will, on being the best you you can be. Take it or leave it. There's no in between. I'll take it.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Wasn't \\"The Lottery\\" assigned reading in HS, so that we could realize that there is a genre of perverse that exists, but keep it short and move on?  Well, here comes a long, infinitely boring and violent account of survival where the goal is to kill other people to stay alive.  The author actually forces the reader into the position of cheering the brutal death of another teen in favor of the surviving protagonist.  And, seriously, who didn't know 10 minutes into the novel that \\"Catnip\\" would win????  If you like a more perverse and nasty reality than what we already live in, hey, read and \\"enjoy\\"!  I find it a very slick way of desensitizing our outrage and morality.

He offered to change my mark. :^)<br /><br />But this is supposed to be a book review right? I was drawn into Anne's world. I feel like I know her. It was one of the best books I have read and I look forward to meeting her someday. I'd say this is a must read for fathers of teenage girls. I'm sure girls in the 40's are not so different from today.<br /><br />Anne you are an amazing young lady!<br /><br />Jamie
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I picked up Amaryllis after a few Shinedown songs found their way into my Pandora radio feed.  Truthfully, prior to this album, I had not really given the band much attention.  However, Amaryllis is a solid album start to finish with some heavy hitting tunes and some great slower rock grooves.  I was definitely compelled to dig back into SD's previous releases after hearing this album and am glad to have added another great band to my list of favorites. Some of my favorite tracks include: Adrenaline, Bully, Enemies, Nowhere Kids, Miracle, For My Sake and My Name.  Great album, well balanced, great production too.  A+ Highly Recommended!
B00756GKBA|1.0|I will fully admit right here at the start of this review that I have not heard the whole album; before downloading it, I had heard the first 2 singles & I thought it might not be too bad...I only got as far as \\"Gang Bang\\" before I had to turn it off! Lyrics like \\"bang bang shoot you dead/shot my lover in the head\\" and describing a drive-by, screaming \\"die bitch die\\" & \\"I don't feel no regret\\" are incredibly offensive and inciteful (NOT insightful - This is meant to incite, as in violence). Is this a cynical grab for gang members to broaden her youth market base, which is flagging - perhaps, but this is not the way to go about it, preaching violence and hate...she has gone too far.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna's \\"MDNA\\" is easily the most accessible album she has made in years, even more so than 2008's \\"Hard Candy\\". Personally, I think this CD is more fun and entertaining and catchy than anything she put out in the 90s or 2000s.<br /><br />The CD starts off with \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", the second single to be released off the disc. It's not the greatest thing she's done and is far from the best on the CD. It's serviceable enough and should fit well in the dance clubs. \\"Gang Bang\\" is a very catchy song with a very sing a long worthy chorus. And no, it is not about what you think it is by the title. \\"I'm Addicted\\" is light and catchy, but mostly disposable dance pop. So far, it's easy listening, but nothing great. But now it turns. \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" is a fun and catchy tune with shades of old school pop. The first single, \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\", has been criticized for being weak and not a great lead single. On it's own, it is a great and instantly catchy pop song that sounds like a hit single. I can do without Nicki Minaj though. We all can. \\"Superstar\\" has a great drum beat intro and a sweetly sung and catchy chorus. This song definitely sounds like it could be a single on the radio. It should be. Two of my top favorite tracks are up next. \\"I Don't Give A\\" is one of the top highlights of the entire CD. It's insanely catchy and it builds to an epic finish with what sounds like a church choir in an empty room. Amazing! \\"I'm A Sinner\\" has shades of Madonna's 1999 hit, \\"Beautiful Stranger\\". This is no surprise as she made both songs with William Orbit. 'Sinner' is even better. The CD ends with another pleasant song called \\"Love Spent\\", and the only softer, ballad-y songs with \\"Masterpiece\\" and \\"Falling Free\\". The only two songs on the CD that don't do anything for me.<br /><br />As for the deluxe version of this release, it is worth it just for \\"B-Day Song\\" alone. \\"Beautiful Killer\\" and \\"Best Friend\\" don't do it for me, and the party rock remix of \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" isn't essential. \\"I F***** Up\\" is the only other worthy track on disc 2's extra set of songs. A song that only Madonna could do. But, for me, the standout in the deluxe edition is \\"B-Day Song\\". It's light and airy and harmless, but it has a great 1960s girl group sound to it that it's just fun. It wouldn't sound too out of place next to \\"True Blue\\". Sure to put a smile on your face. Sometimes that's all you need.<br /><br />All in all, I find \\"MDNA\\" is to be an exceptional release from Madonna. Besides most of the hit singles, I have not been a huge fan of the albums she has put out in the last two decades. A lot of the time, the singles released from the albums were the only tracks I liked. \\"MDNA\\" is a release meant to have fun and for the material girl to be MADONNA. She can still sound like she's still 23. \\"MDNA\\" is a blast. While many of the younger acts today seem to be trying hard to be cool and get on the radio, \\"MDNA\\" makes it all seem so effortless.
B005ER6SNM|4.0|This film should have a pg-13 rating. Most of the actual supposed \\"depraved\\" scenes are assumed and distorted. There are no zoom ins and good focusing on any of these types of scenes. Basically the BAD parts are more or less hinted at and assumed. You could watch this movie with your children and they would be none the wiser. Really not as bad as it is made out to be. The assumptions and ideas are deffinately one of a kind and could be a First Time for most viewers.........would a foreign version show more??
B0074EIQQU|5.0|The Mars Volta return in 2012 with their sixth full-length studio album, Noctourniquet. As with most of their work many people will have made up their mind about whether they'll like it beforehand anyway, based on whether or not they like how the band keeps changing away from its early style. This time there is also a bit of interesting non-musical context surrounding the album that explains how and why Noctourniquet is the record that it is.<br /><br />Firstly, the band have been known in the past for having somewhat exacting standards of quality and timing and so if they aren't happy with something it doesn't come out under their name. This has lead to a live album and at least two full studio albums being scrapped or put on hold so far. During their previous album Octahedron's cycle the band claimed that the follow up album was already recorded, but soon after they decided to make this yet newer album instead. Now however it is unclear whether they actually did or not.<br /><br />It is also interesting that the band would put out a new studio album so close to when the At The Drive In reunion is going on, almost like either the band or the record company don't want fans to forget about The Mars Volta.<br /><br />Finally, the line-up has seen a change; Isaiah Ikey Owens is absent from the keyboard position for the first time, John Frusciante doesn't contribute any guitar and Deantoni Parks makes his studio debut as the band's new drummer. Interestingly; despite the album being made without their long time keys player Owens, Noctourniquet seems to be driven primarily by Synths. Of course, The Mars Volta have always made use of keys and synths but this album features them even more than usual.<br /><br />Context is interesting and can unfairly doom or raise an album more than it deserves, but the fairest way to judge an album is on the music. Musically, this album is very different from previous Mars Volta efforts. If you have been paying any attention to the band's career trajectory however you would expect that already as the band always take a new direction and never repeat the same thing twice.<br /><br />This wasn't the record anyone expected the band to put out, which is exactly what makes the band so great in the first place. The band have come a long way since their classic debut album De-Loused In The Comatorium, both shedding and making thousands of fans with each release. As long as there is weird and creative music with Cedric's voice and Omar's guitar style it'll feel acceptable to call it The Mars Volta. Just to make things a little easier however, Noctourniquet is another concept album like most of their previous works which helps it to fit in a little better too.<br /><br />With Noctourniquet the music has taken a distinctly more electronic turn. Additionally, the music is a lost less explosive and brash than their heaviest works and a lot less complex and jazzy than their most Progressive Rock influenced works. The band almost seems to be channeling later-day Radiohead at times, or at least some of the same influences.<br /><br />At first listen the album can feel like it is off on a wild tangent deliberately trying to be different, but it is a grower as always and repeat listens will help it to make sense within the band's overall catalogue. Cedric has described the sound as \\"Future Punk\\" and you can get what that was supposed to mean when listening to tracks like `In Absentia,' `The Whip Hand' or lead single `The Malakin Jewel,' but if you don't like the idea of \\"Future Punk\\" don't worry however, as this isn't the whole picture.<br /><br />Tracks like `Aegis' `Empty Vessels Make The Loudest Sounds' and quieter songs like `Trinkets Pale Of Moon' feel a bit more like previous Mars Volta work and wouldn't have been that drastically out of place on Octahedron or Bedlam In Goliath. These songs are perhaps the most instantly enjoyable, if you don't like too much change.<br /><br />Overall; evolution and drastically changing is business as usual for The Mars Volta. Noctourniquet feels like it might be half trying to do something genuinely new and half trying to keep one foot in their previous style. As always with The Mars Volta a lot of fans will hate this album just because it isn't like their debut, a lot of fans will blindly love the album no matter what and a lot of people will feel initially confused before it eventually grows on them. Chose which category you usually fall into and chances are that will probably be a good indicator of how you feel about this record too.y changing is business as usual for The Mars Volta.

B00756GKBA|4.0|While definitely not as powerful as Ray of Light (probably her best work), there are a few tracks that instantly jump out. Gang Bang and I'm A Sinner instantly became my favorites, the latter sharing a distinct rhythm with Beautiful Stranger. I'm sure some of the other tracks will grow on me over time as happens with most Madonna songs. It should be interesting to see how she incorporates this new material into her upcoming tour.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|You would think that a film with such a sure-fire cast would automatically be brilliant. The commercials made it look like it could either be entirely promising or just simply terrible. Unfortunately, if you have any taste in the aesthetics of film-making and the tradition of weaving plots, this film falls into the second of those options. Western lovers and sci-fi fanatics alike are bound to be disappointed if they've ever laid eyes on a well-done film in either of those genres. This film carries your generic over-powered Western bad-guy and the idiot alien race that decides abduction and observation are the best ways to complete an invasion. Add in the mining for an element and never explaining the significance beyond \\"it's rare to them, too\\", poorly developed overly-generic alien forms, and some of the most generalized racism to show its face in even a Western... this film is entirely unbelievable and lacks the creativity that went into making such movies as appear in the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, or even in such films as \\"Serenity\\", \\"Space Cowboys\\", \\"Wild Wild West\\", etc. Anyone with any taste of what classic films are supposed to be like -- with strong scripts and astounding landscapes -- are to be sorely disappointed. However, if cliche and over-done, I'm-going-to-rely-solely-on-the-graphics-of-the-space-stuffs-to-carry-this-movie films are what you're into -- I say \\"right on\\". Otherwise, keep your money. This is NOT worth it. At most, I'd say borrow from your local library or a friend. Rent it if need be. But DO NOT buy it.
1451673442|5.0|I like that this is the 3rd installment of \\"The Secret\\" series.  It helps those of us who want to continue our journey with the extra steps we need to keep making things happen in life.

However, the headings do not appear in the \\"Showing Bookmarks\\" view, only the beginning lines of prose show up which is of no help in navigating.<br /><br />As a student, the supposed target market of the Kindle, it is a nightmare to try and read this book critically and thoroughly.<br /><br />Overall, most kindle books seem to be lacking in browse-ablity.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|When I first heard about this c.d, I didn't think I would like that kind of music, boy was I wrong!!! This music may have the old style, but the way Cher and Christina sing it just makes you want to get up and dance. They both have such a wonderful voice. With Chers lower voice and christina reaching those high notes all the music was great.

B00005JOFQ|2.0|Bette Davis once said: \\"I adore cheap sentiment.\\" Well, I don't. My problem with the film has nothing to do with subject matter or actors, although looking for nooky among sheep is a bit weird. Consider these items... Ang Lee is Taiwanese, and Annie Proulx lived most of her life in Maine, until recently moving to Wyoming. Is either of these folks gay? Does either one really understand the values and mind-set of cowboys or Wyoming natives? The film is based upon Proulx's short story, yet it lasts for two and a quarter hours. Add to this the fact that the film is too long for what it achieves... We have no flashbacks or voice-overs to help us understand each character's backstory. Less is more... Scenes would pack more punch if they established something about the characters in a focussed manner, but they drag on aimlessly. Yes, we have to know they're bored and lonely, but assume the audience is intelligent and gets it without overkill. The mountain scenes (pretty to National Geographic addicts) could easily be shortened. As touching as Ledger's pouting tight-lipped speech patterns might be, it is hard to understand the minimal dialogue with this added impediment. Now that gay films are more skilfully written and acted, they are more accessible to straight people. And they leave this film in the dust with regard to brilliant dialogue, backstory, likeable characters, excellent editing and character development. There is no character development in a short story. Why base a film on it, then? Check out Latter Days and Get Real, for starters.

Although the story is a bit dark at times, with Kvothe being perhaps one of the most unlucky people in the history of mankind, there are also passages that had me laughing out loud.  I have also read The Wise Man's Fear, and am very much looking forward to any and all subsequent books in this series.

They use small loops of lace , which on the shoe we got, basically overlap. I cant really describe it well, but it makes for a frustrating experience for a toddler, and is nothing like lacing a real shoe.<br /><br />You know what really teaches kids how to tie shoe laces? Their OWN SHOES!!!
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Highly recommend this item for the beauty of the music alone.  As you listen, you can almost see Scheherazade telling her story that lasted 1001 nights until the King finally fell in love with her.  What else can I say except that I have a very long commute to and from work. Since I found this music and play it on my way home I find it totally relaxing and no stress!! You can get caught up in the melody without getting distracted.  Well worth the purchase only sorry I didn't do it sooner.

145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss is an exceptional writer and communicator; if you've read [[ASIN:0465002048 The Physics of Star Trek]], you'll know that.  (And if you haven't, you should go buy that one as well.)  So right off the bat, you can discount any of the one-star reviews arguing that the book isn't well-written.  I'm a lawyer, not a scientist, and I can follow Krauss's explanations with ease.  He's that good.<br /><br />Of course, when the one-star reviewers claim the book isn't well-written, that isn't really what they mean, anyway.  What every single one of those reviews actually means is that Krauss is (gasp!) an *atheist*, and as a result, his work on this earth is evil and cannot be trusted, and must be down-voted.  This is a petty and stupid thing to do, in my view, particularly given that _A Universe From Nothing_ is not an \\"atheist book\\" in the same way that, say, _The God Delusion_ is an atheist book.  Krauss isn't arguing that religion is wrong or stupid or evil; he's simply presenting the evidence for a naturalistic explanation for the universe.<br /><br />Now, Krauss is indeed an atheist.  He's outspoken and open about it.  If that bothers you -- if you simply cannot stomach the thought of reading something written by an atheist, no matter what the content -- then you should probably find another book.  You'll be doing yourself a disservice, because this is a truly fantastic book, but hey:  to each his or her own.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're reasonably open-minded and you like physics and you especially like hard questions, then I suspect you'll like this book even if you're a Christian.  Krauss sets off to answer some of the most interesting questions we have today, such as:  \\"Where did the universe come from?\\" and \\"What happened before the Big Bang?\\"  In an incredibly accessible way, Krauss walks the reader through the evidence scientists have gathered about the the Big Bang and its implications for the origin of the universe.  Ultimately, Kraussconcludes, time, space and matter -- what we think of as \\"something\\" -- forms because \\"nothing\\" (the absence of time, space and matter) is \\"inherently unstable\\" via the laws of physics and quantum mechanics as we know them.  This is a truly unique contribution to the state of current scientific knowledge.  Moreover, Krauss extrapolates to show that the laws of physics *themselves* may follow inexorably from what we know about quantum mechanics.  This is, to put it mildly, really, really, really neat (whether you agree with it or not).<br /><br />It's also threatening to a very tiny minority of noisy religious apologists.  You see, if Krauss is correct, then one need not postulate a god or gods in order to explain the existence of the universe.  One is of course free to believe in gods anyway; nothing in Krauss's book rules them *out*.  But a great many Christian apologists believe that their God is the *only* explanation for the universe that counts, and Krauss does indeed tackle that argument straight on.<br /><br />As a result -- and spurred on by what seems to me to be a truly hateful review by David Albert in the New York Times -- critics have come out of the woodwork to object that Krauss's argument doesn't *really* explain everything, because it doesn't explain where the properties of quantum mechanics come from.  In a small sense, they're right.  It doesn't.  But this book doesn't purport to explain that.  Maybe someday Dr. Krauss (or someone else) will, or maybe the question is unanswerable.  I just don't know.  What I do know is that is ridiculous to rate a book as one-star for failing to do something IT DOES NOT CLAIM TO DO, while at the same time ignoring the fact that the book succeeds masterfully in answering profound and previously unanswered questions about \\"something\\" -- the universe, time, space, matter, and even the laws of physics themselves -- that nobody was able to answer before.  That's truly amazing, and even the one-star reviews don't claimthat the book fails to do what it actually promises to do.<br /><br />In sum:  Krauss's book is phenomenally well-written, it answers questions no one has ever answered before, and it does so in a way that even non-scientists like me can follow.  Even if you're religious, you owe it to yourself to check out what Krauss has to say, because his answers are only threatening to a tiny minority of cranky apologists who are making a very, very narrow argument as to why their god *must* exist.

B004QOB8SY|5.0|I tell everybody around me that the last episode of Season 1 plus the first of 2 combine to be the best 180 minute of detective TV thriller, ever. I would like to bet my reputation on that. So far, nobody (10+ referrals made) complained that he or she had been disapointed despite the high expectation set by me. The vivid music, the witty script (e.g. Brainy is the new sexy), the sophisticated yet intriguing plots, the excellent performing actors, the state of the art choreography....are all, IMHO, perfect. In short, dont miss it.<br /><br />p.s. Pity that there are only three episode per season, and I need to wait till 2013 for Season 3.

This case would be perfect if it wasn't cheesy looking up close, but it is still my favorite daily abuse case.<br /><br />Edit: May 30, 2012<br /><br />My iPhone 4 continues to survive. It got some water damage about a month ago and the dock connector ended up corroding so bad I had to replace it to get my dock, microphone, and home button back, but it works perfectly again. The glass is scratched all over because I don't use a screen protector, but no cracks and no internal damage from drops. No buttons are jammed from drops. It's an ugly phone at this point where the case doesn't cover, but if it weren't for this case, I would have a cracked screen at the very least, and most likely internal damage. Think you Amazon, for making a case durable enough for the most abused iPhone out there!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the series, but just couldn't love the last book as much.  I wish there would've been more about the characters themselves.  I don't want to say anything more and spoil it for any new readers, but it is still definitely worth the read.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|As a long time watcher of this show, from the very first episode, I have to say that even though it's not a very strong season, it is still fun, interesting and a show well worth watching.  I personally love the fact that they are not afraid to get rid of long standing characters like Bobby and Cas.  I had mixed feelings about the last episode where Cas takes Sam's place, but Cas as an angel did the ultimate sacrifice for his friends.  It's not that Sam and Dean don't need him anymore, and yes I do feel Cas will be back in the future, it's just they have to grow and move on, as things do in real life.  Also, with Meg working there, she'll find a way to get Cas back because she has it in for Crowley and Satan.  That alone has me certain that the old Cas will be back to help Sam and Dean in the end.<br /><br />This show mixes it up, and they did big time once Kripke left.  I like this season more than season 6, but both seasons have its big ups and downs.  I loved some of the characters and am sad to see Bobby, kind of like Sam and Dean, that felt like losing my Dad... Cas, an old good friend even Baltesar, I loved his character and like many characters in Supernatural, you may see them again.  Remember, it's called Supernatural...anything can happen.<br /><br />I like how both characters have grown, but stayed the same.  The current producers and writers have Sam and Dean true to themselves.  Anyone whose watched this show from the beginning will agree, sure they've grown up, but they are still the same too.  Now that takes a lot of talent and work to create characters that grow and stay the same for 7 years.<br /><br />I disagree with what one review said about `weak' characters.  I love Frank!  He's such a cranky old guy, like their grandpa just giving them, well mostly Dean crap.  I liked the witches from earlier in the season.  Played by Charisma Carpenter and James Marsters from Buffy the Vampire.  Those two were a riot and I hope we see them again!!  And the Leviathans themselves.  The actor playing Dick Roman is scary and reminds me of a presidential candidate.  I do wonder if that was intentional???  And Mark Pellegrino as Satan... wonderful actor and character!<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this season, is the missing Impala... they even used a few rock names in the last few episodes, but still no return of the car...  bummed, in the same breath, I am enjoying some of the classic muscle cars they've been driving since.  All a little beat up compared to the Impala,  as if to say not as loved, but still again, Sam and Dean true to their roots.<br /><br />I like the return of monster of the week, like the old days.  I also like that they are blaming some of these monsters on the leviathans.  Speaking of them, I find them one of the most interesting monsters ever on TV.  I have never heard of them, but yes I do know of purgatory.  Another reason the angel and demon story is not dead on this serious.  Purgatory is not heaven or hell... but God created it according to the bible. I don't know a lot about them, but it makes me wonder how they will be defeated as only Sam and Dean can of course.  This show takes from lore and does its research.  It's a very intelligent show with good writers, has been from the beginning.  Yet has a sense of humor which is what I think most of the fans really enjoy.<br /><br />With a few episodes left it will be interesting see what they do with these new villains.  I do smell a season 8.  What else does CW have?  Secret circle??  Ugh!
B00756GKBA|5.0|Not as Confession on the dance floor CD but the best after it!!!!! Song that I dont like is B-day but Gang bang; I love it!!!!!Thank you Madonna!!!!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|A friend recommended me this series, and I admit, it took me a bit to get into it. The first chapter really didn't strike me very well, feeling like I was reading a technical manual on fighting rather than a dynamic battle between Atticus and some lesser fae.<br /><br />That, however, changes rapidly. After the first quarter of the book, it really falls into its voice and shines.  I enjoyed all the supporting cast immensely, with one of the main ones being an Irish Wolfhound. The last half of the book was a well-paced build up to a battle you've known was coming since the very first page, and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />I didn't see much in the way of thinking of Atticus that supported his 2100 year old persona - he fit in too particularly well with the modern era and language.  You'd never suspect his age had it not been brought up repeatedly. None the less, Atticus remains a joy to read about, being witty when needed and deadly serious at the drop of a hat. Looking forward to Book 2.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|free not likely... they want real money to play the game and lots of it... so don't waste your time or money on this &quot;free&quot; app.
0307346617|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a fictional account of a worldwide outbreak of a zombie virus, and more than being about the zombies, it's about people's reactions to war and to death and destruction. That's what makes this book great- you don't really have to be interested in zombies to like this book.<br /><br />The book is written as a series of interviews with various different survivors from the war, ranging from priests to astronauts to children to dog handlers. Brooks has a great sense of voice, and each character is distinct and different to the last, which can't be an easy task.<br /><br />One thing I really loved about this book was the fact that the zombies are scary. I'm done with the trend for paranormal creatures to be sexy/lovable (though I will allow sexy if the monsters are also capable of being scary). Brooks' zombies are straight out of a good old-fashioned Romero film (and in fact he thanks Romero in his acknowledgements). They are intent on eating human flesh, and nothing more. They are unthinking, unfeeling monsters, and that's the way they should be.<br /><br />Some reviews I've read have mentioned the lack of conflict. They mention the fact that because we know Brooks is interviewing survivors, a lot of the tension is taken out of the book, because we know the person survived. I don't think that's true. Yes, we know the person survived physically, but the big question of this book, one that's overtly referred to by a lot of survivors, is did humanity survive?<br /><br />Yes, perhaps it would have been a more tense read if it had been written as the characters were fighting the hoards of the living dead, but that's been done, by just about every book and film and TV series out there. Nearly every book on the subject deals with the reactions of a small group of survivors.<br /><br />Brooks took a different angle, and a global perspective, and is to be applauded for that. This book is a much-needed breath of fresh air in a sub-genre that is ultimately one big cliché (and I say that as a HUGE fan of zombies). This book reads like sociology disguised as post-apocalyptic fiction.<br /><br />The zombies are largely background actors. The book is really about people's will to survive (or lack thereof) and what war and killing and destruction does to people.The zombies could be replaced by any other cause of international conflict, and that's what makes this book feel so realistic (yes, I know, but realism is important even when discussing reanimated corpses).<br /><br />Although the past-tense narration and the fact that the reader knows the characters all survived the war can take away some immediacy, each individual chapter is truly gripping. Brooks' vision of how governments and international bodies and people from different cultures would react to such a disaster is absolutely fascinating, though the nitty-gritty detail may bore some people.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|one of the best albums in a very long time.<br />I'm pleasantly surprised. well worth the price. buy it now.. you wont be disappointed.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Though I am not particularly a Bruce Willis fan, and I think he is some what in love with himself, This movie, i quite enjoy, The Dry sarcasm and humor mixed with the HOLY - BOOM - of movie magic, just makes a damn good movie. Totally worth it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app.  Use it all the time.  Even recommend it to my students. I haven't ever needed to go to the pay option either.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It's much better than \\"Hard Candy.\\" For example, I had to listen to \\"Hard Candy\\" several times before I was able to appreciate that record. MDNA instantly catches you in. Overall, it's a typical Madonna release: few dance pop anthems that will be very popular hits in the clubs, a ballad or two and a bunch of other songs, in this case, those other songs\\" are actually very good. Lyrically, Madonna exposes herself emotionally. From what I was able to gather and understand, she dedicated a lot of the songs on MDNA to her divorce from Guy Ritchie.<br /><br />Madonna continues to reinvents herself while maintaining originality. Whether you're a fan since her \\"Holiday\\" days or if you're still growing up and just learning about Madonna, one fact still stands: She may be over 50, but there's no way you can tell that from her record(s), her performances and her songs. Enjoy this album. It will become one of the shining items in her extensive discography.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Like most fans I fell in love with Jennfer Hudson the first time I saw Dreamgirls.  I own both her CDs and I purchased a second copy of I Remember Me so I could keep it in my car at all times.  She is this generations most powerful female voice....her tribute to Whitney proved that.
B0051OTBI2|4.0|Well what can I say about this CD, it's a great album full with great musicians. The rock songs \\"Here by my side\\", \\"With you\\" , \\"Thunder in your heart\\" and \\"The Chosen ones\\" are truly AOR/Melodic Rock gems; \\"Center of the universe\\" is a cool uptempo ballad that reminds me a lot of Richard Marx's classic albums. The reason that I scored this one 4 stars is that it has some fillers, there are some soft songs that I think are not AOR, instead I find them more onto a west-cost/michael bolton category. Still it's worth it to get it. Actually I tend to like this CD over the latest Work of Art CD.
B004I8WD6E|1.0|PROS:  fast shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I've never used a worst iphone case like this one<br />- Sharp corners and edges, it hurts your hand after 3 minutes of continuous use. This can result in hand injury.<br />- The texture is too hard<br />- Too difficult to take out from iphone<br />- I threw it away after first use<br />- Too thick<br /><br />I don't get it why this product get good reviews. It's sold from Amazon, probably the reviewers are Amazon's employees!<br /><br />This product suppose to get 0/5, but due to fast shipping, it gets 1 star.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|A lot of fun and a great time killer. Sometimes I spend too much time on it. Thoroughly recommend it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love the new space version, a fresh approach to Angry Birds.  Requires some getting used to but a great challenge with all the additions, and the visuals<br />are wonderful and creative.  A winner that will hold me over until the next new one comes out; worth the money.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use my kindle for everything!!  I'm not sure how I got by without it.  No more need to buy tiny lights to read at night with.  I wish every book was available on my kindle.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I'd give this 4.5 if I could. After the horrible Batman & Robin, this movie I entered with curiosity and skepticism. Would I be disappointed again by my favorite hero? A resounding 'NO!'. When I saw this movie, I saw Batman like I never saw him before in live-action. The moment he lifted up the corrupt Flass and told him 'Swear to me!', Batman was back and bigger & badder than ever. Nolan became my hero ever since. He is truly a master at his craft. Batman Begins single-handedly resurrected my favorite hero and I couldn't be happier. :)
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Meryl Streep won a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to this day one of the most powerful women who has ever graced the earth.<br /><br /> \\"The Iron Lady\\" begins with an aged Thatcher walking the streets of London, well into her eighties, buying fruits and vegetables, with no one recognizing who she is. The film is told in flashback as we learn of Margaret's upbringing, her interst in political life and her ultimate postion as Britain's first female head-of-state.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep's performance here is nothing short of astonishing: her speech, facial expressions (helped by inventive make-up) and her mannerisms are dead-on. Streep had never met the real Thatcher, but was able to view old film's from archives from the BBC and other sources and it was from watching Thatcher that Streep discovered how to play her.<br /><br /> It took Meryl 29 years to win another Oscar thanks to this role. As a huge fan of hers I have to say \\"The Iron Lady\\" is my favorite of all the performances Streep has done.<br /><br /> Simply an A+ film.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Easily the greatest comicbook movie and one of the best movies, period. Very well written and acted. I love watching this movie. The rivalry between Batman and The Joker was brilliantly captured in less than 3 hours. Impressive. Nolan is THE MAN! Can't wait for The Dark Knight Rises. It will rule.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|WTF? Not working with kindle fire? Good job amazon, seriously WTF? Further more, why are the free app of the day apps getting so crummy? They seemed better in the first few months, and young child apps? What a wad. Like I am going to let a kid play with my kindle fire, but I guessing that's why I am bitching about a free app.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|The understated drama that results from the documentary technique makes for a movie that isn't immediately entertaining.  However, like Traffic, I'll find myself watching it again and again.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I love The Walking Dead. The series is great. My mother and father, 60 and 68 respectively, have started watching it and are hooked. They don't like horror stuff and it took a lot of convincing at first. But not I have to tell them to be patient about new episodes. Give it a try if you on the fence or even if you think you won't like it. You might be surprised.<br /><br />That being said, I wanted to address what I see as an issue specific to the Limited Edition Box Set. It doesn't seem to having any bonus features that the regular version wont have. Unless you're a collector you may want to avoid this version of the second season, at least until a version with more bonus videos and extras is made available for those who want more bang for their buck.<br /><br />My rating for this item was based on my opinion of the show itself. My rating for this specific Limited Edition is 2 stars.
0307891372|5.0|Got my order fast and the item was just the way it was described :) My book was brand new and the map was intact. Found a lot of cool things and made my gaming easier.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Very well done comedy.  It won't appeal to everyone, which to me is part of it's appeal.  The Dude, Walter, etc. are all unique and interesting characters in their own funny ways.  Every line seems funnier the more you watch the film.  It's hard to describe, but I recommend everyone see it and you'll either love it or not get it.  But I'm betting most will love it.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This was a really interesting story.  I loved reading the ideas about vampires, daemons and witches and how they recognize one another and how they interact in this story.  This author pulls history into the mix and crafts an in depth tale around each of her key characters.  I found myself really enjoying this one, although the \\"get it done\\" part of me wanted to complete it a lot quicker than I was able to.  I also found myself procrastinating some because it was taking me so long to finish.  That said, I am glad I read it and I plan to read the next two in the series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are fun and entertaining. i like the games they picked. its awesome . its just really good fun app
B00756GKBA|5.0|Given the nature of this album talks about her divorce quite heavily this album is a mixture of ballads and up tempo songs that definitely surpasses Hard Candy. It's not as great as Confessions on a Dance floor but this is well executed!!! Great Job Madonna!!!!
B004LROUW2|3.0|Much as I love Murakami, this book was a big disappointment.  It was interesting, but not particularly engaging or suspenseful.  Some of it was rather preposterous.  Many things that happened were justified by as simple statement to the effect that that is just the way it is.  Over-long, I finished it because after a certain point, I had made an investment.  Also, I kept hoping I would like it better, which didn't happen.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is a blast! I love that I can just check in every now and then, and the restaurant runs while I'm away ... as if I'm a real owner ;)
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is a fun app. easy to play, but still challenging. I recommend it to solitaire lovers. tried on kindle fire.
0763644765|5.0|My toddler and I both loved this book. She quotes it often :-)  What I like most about this book is it simplicity. The curious baby wonders where the doggy and kitty go potty, then wonders if he/she should go in their potty.  The illustrations show that going potty isn't always an instantaneous thing for someone new to the experience. I feel that the simplicity of this book gave me the chance to fill in the details, using my own words. I also like that this book is gender neutral, so I can use it with my son, when he's ready.<br />I would absolutely recommend this book to a friend or family member when they're ready to begin the potty training process!
B006ON41FC|5.0|best ever game it is so much fun I play on the go or anywhere it truly rocks I will never stop playing
0486284735|5.0|Like all the other Jane Austen books I loved this one just as much. Jane Austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more. Trust me - you won't be able to get your hands off this classic that is still entertaining to read today. A book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
0143119680|5.0|Where to start? Jamie Fraiser & Claire Beauchamp have competition. Serious, fascinating competition.<br />I want to stop everything and start the novel all over again.<br />Reviewing this book, describing it is reminscent of trying to describe 'Outlander' 20 years ago.<br />So just read it already so we can commence squeeing together.<br /><br />Outlander Genre: Long fascinating stories with heaps of Science, History, Time Travel, Adventure, and Magic.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|The Grey is one of the greatest survival movies I have ever seen, The plane crash seen alone is worth huge props. It is right up there with \\"Alive\\", and \\"The Edge\\". It starts out a little slow. But once the plane crashes its a chess match between man and beast. And oh yeah, dont forget mother nature, These guys are extremely outmatched, they have no food, no weapons, they are being hunted by a pack of wolves. And to top it all off, they are in the middle of the Alaskin wilderness, with no civilization in sight.It is a treat to watch Liam Neeson in my opinion, one of his greatest performances to date. Just an all around epic movie, If you like outdoorsie flicks, survial stuff etc. you will love The Grey. I give it two huge thumbs up, one last thing, the score for this movie is perfect, subtle tones , nothing overbearing like loud drums, just perfect, especially at the ending, the music was perfect for the mood.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great for wasting time and having fun. I think it is really good for when you are sitting somewhere being bored, it can help you out.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Ok, I don't know how she does it.  Leave it to Madonna to outdo herself once again. 30 years later, she emerages with MDNA which is, hands down, her best work to date!!!  This is the record fans have been waiting for.  Take a listen-- She is sure to pick up new fans and doubters with this release. Madonna is without sounding contrived or forced, but alive and full throttle like the title implies.  This Madonna is fully present in control and kickin' ass while taking you for an intoxicating ride on the dance floor where she reigns best. Listen up world, on this record she's on fire, pissed off, playful and irreverent.  It will make get out of your seat, dance, laugh, cry and feel on top of the world.  Long Live the Queen!  Gaga, needs to sit down for a while, because the Queen is back on the Throne bitch!
0393338398|4.0|This is a great book on the topic of sabermetrics.  Lewis uses Billy Beane and the Oakland A's as his test case, arguing that the proper use of statistics in baseball can overcome any financial limitations a team might have.  In the early 2000s, Beane had one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, and yet his teams managed to win 100+ games multiple seasons in a row.  How did he do it?  He realized that the game of baseball was a process, in which the output was to score runs.  He also found the world of sabermetrics (study of baseball statistics) and used the key stats/metrics that factored into generating runs to build his roster.  Luckily for him, it just so happened that his \\"key stats\\" were worth very little money on the open market.  He thus aggressively sought after players who other teams overlooked, paid them their \\"market worth\\" and used them to build a winning ball club.<br /><br />Since I have an interest in baseball and work in the field of quality, I really enjoyed this book.  It's a great piece of objective evidence that taking a process- and fact-based approach to a task can generate great results.  It was also very interesting to see the history of Billy Beane, and how he turned what many would consider a failed career as a player into an exceptional career as GM.  The only downside to this book is that it ends somewhat abruptly.  I felt like it needed two or three more chapters to round out the story and tie up loose ends.<br /><br />In any case, anyone interested in baseball, statistics, or quality in general should pick up this book.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|Overall, while Happy Feet two is not nearly as good as the first one movie it does carry a positive message about the importance of family, friends, following your dreams, and that anyone can make a change.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You can read the description of the book to get the plot.  I read this book in two days (while trying to get other things done).  I usually like to read negative reviews to get a feel for the other opinion.  In this case though, I think those opinions are flawed.  One reviewer posted that they were appalled at the book's apparent support of teenagers killing teenagers.  I think this book is pointing out what society can become IF we don't put safeguards in place.  I mean, seriously, do people really go to a boring race to see who crosses the finish line first?  I don't think so.  And football is not any safer.  I encourage you to read the triology and learn from the life lessons presented in them.
0470901071|4.0|I have read the other reviews and have two things to start with.  First, whether you like the writing style or not is a personal preference.  Some like the conversation style, some don't.  Those who don't, tend to make the ratings very low and vice versa.  Second, you will definitely enjoy this book more if you have some kind of background in networks, routers or switches.  Even previous work on servers or firewalls will help.  A complete novice will have a hard time using just this book to prepare for the CCNA exam.  The info is all there, but it will take considerably more study.<br /><br />Now for my opinion.  First, I came to decide to get my CCNA certification \\"off the street\\" due to sudden unemployment.  I have never touched a router or switch (other than help rack them).  My education in technology is from a beginning class on BASIC programming.  If you don't know, it was back when desktop computers had NO memory.  No one has done BASIC programming in over 20 years.  So I had a fundamental understanding of what a packet was well before all of today's protocols and processes but that was about it.  I found the CCNA 7th Edition to be too deep for such a beginner.  Todd does have a tendency to introduce a new term or item without the student having any knowledge of that item.  But if you stick with it, everything is explained later.  This results in a reader really needing to go through the book more than once so the second time (or third, fourth, etc) around, when something not yet covered is introduced, you have an understanding of what is being discussed and you get the \\"ah-ha\\" moment.  I do not fault the book for that as I've noticed similar issues with other books due to the complexity of the subject matter.  It really depends on your level of understanding whether or not this is an issue.  There are parts where the explanations were not complete enough for me to understand but I picked up the CCENT and Network+ books as well.  I figured staying with the same author would keep the train of thought running.  The other two books, in conjuction with the CCNA 7th Edition were the key to understanding as they explained certain things in different ways that filled in the gaps.  It all goes back to knowing the fundamentals EXTREMELY well.  Last, I was disappointed that a complete version of the book was not on the CD.  Searching for topics and pages is much easier and complete than trying to do an Index search in a book.  It is especially important with subject matter this complicated and is the main reason I did not give a 5 star.<br /><br />I totally agree with Todd's view of understanding the basics completely before moving on.  That doesn't mean just answering a question but being able to explain everything backwards and forwards without even thinking about it as to WHY that answer is correct.  I have not yet taken the CCNA exam because being unemployed, I want to be 100% sure I'll pass the first time as I can't afford a second shot at Cisco's prices!<br /><br />DISCLOSURE:  I have also taken Todd's boot camp class.  I tried not to let this personal interaction affect my review but it is only fair to let you know I do know Todd personally.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|New update adds the ability to gain achievement points toward a reward.  New blade?  Spiffy new background?  Like Chuck Testa says:  NOPE!  It's progress toward some lame coupon by a site called beintoo.  Used to love this game.  It's now uninstalled, along with the PiB version.  Bad move, Halfbrick.
0307352145|3.0|This is an interesting read! There are people in this world who are introverted & there are those who are extroverted. At the end of the day, when it is all said & done, people are going to be who they are. Those who are introverts will resort to the quietness of their soul, while extroverts will resort to speaking & sharing their soul. However, it is a great discipline to practice the opposite of your natural personality, so that you grow in your natural tendencies and grow in your unnatural tendencies. Extroverts need times of solitude, which will benefit their extroverted ways. Those who are introverted need times of speaking and sharing vocally, so that they benefit in reflection/solitude.<br /><br />As for those who are public speakers, ministers, etc - you need the discipline of being quiet...so that your time in speaking reflects your time in solitude.<br /><br />Some ideas & themes from the book are...<br /><br />Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.<br />\\"Quiet leadership\\" is not an oxymoron.<br />Everyone shines, given the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight, for others, a lamplit desk.<br />This book has some beneficial truths about introverts & the power of being in times of quiet. However, their a redundancy of addressing the nature & issues that introverts deal with. If you can sift through the redundancy, you may learn some essentials about introvertedness and the benefits of quietness.<br /><br />I received this book for the purpose of review from Multnomah Publishers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not a big book reader by any means. Actually this is the first book I've ever completely read. I heard from a few people that this book was really good so I though what the hell. Had no idea what the book was about when I started reading, but from the point I downloaded it onto my ipad2 I think I finished it in like a week. Thats between being married a full time student and working 30 hrs a week. I couldn't put the damn thing down. I own all three books now haven't started the second one yet.
B004UHSB5A|2.0|i would enjoy it if I could resize. i cant grasp pieces on kindle fire. very frustrating. hard to see too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is great - makes you cry, laugh, and feel everything. It's not confusing. I saw the movie with someone who hadn't read the book and they kept asking me what was happening. So read the book if you want a real view of this story. The movie is ok but doesn't give the kind of feeling the book does.<br /><br />Understanding the districts especially it is necessary to read the book. The characters are developed so well by Suzanne Collins and you really feel like you understand them and what they're doing and why. Like Katniss sacrificing herself for her sister and what her family went through makes a lot more sense when you read the book. You get none of that in the movie.<br /><br />So if you're interested in this story, definitely read the book first!
0143119680|1.0|I'm glad I came here to read the reviews.  I somehow missed the hype and found this book (on CD) at the library.  I've been listening while I drive and today realized I don't care one bit about Matthew, Diana, tea, wine, yoga, or even Oxford (as it is in this story).  Sliced raw venison with beets and shaved parmesan? Who cares!  I realized I was on disc 6 of 20 and was trying to decide if there was any chance the ending would be worth slogging through any more of this.  Apparently not...sending this one back and on to something better.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|This ia another great game in the angry birds series. I think its one of the better ones have to use different stratagies depending on different objects that may have affects on tragectories
B00756GKBA|1.0|Ok first,this album is trash apparently Madonna copies the queen of pop(ga ga) because her songs sound  familiar mmmmm. Wish I could give this negative stars. Put your paws up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|so yeah the option is there if you want it but this is great for me and it works. thats important. not spammed. asks if you want to play a new game before it starts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So...here is the deal.  I have to admit that when I purchased this book on my Kindle, I wasn't expecting what I got. Usually Kindle knows what it is doing...it recommends books and I take their word for it and buy them.  In fact, for the first 5 chapters of the book...it seemed like any other romantic/tragic novel about a messed up man and some \\"angel\\" that would come along and fix him.  However (and you can imagine my surprise), when I came to THE PART...and you will know what I am talking about once you get there...I quickly put my Kindle down.  I am sure I was blushing.  The crux of it is...I went back for more.  After that...I went back for more and more and more.  This book isn't just some novel about dominant kinky sex, it is so much more than that.  When you are devouring (and I mean devouring) this novel, the sexual parts make the story what it is.  It isn't just \\"thrown in there\\" like so many other romantic books with casual sex scenes.  This is serious, hard core, rock you to your core sexual encounters; but even more so, it speaks to your heart as well.  I know that sounds like a conundrum, but it is the truth.  This book and the following are a testament to true love and the lengths that one woman (and man) would go through to make things work.  What a great ride....literally...READ IT NOW!
030788743X|5.0|There isn't much to say about Ready Player One that hasn't been said a hundred times before.  For any proper geek, it's the story you never knew you always wanted.  In the not too distant future, the internet has evolved into something called the OASIS.  (I'll spare you the meaning of the awkward but painfully realistic backronym.)  The OASIS is a virtual universe; by wearing the right equiment you can actually be there and experience everything your in-world avatar experiences.  The OASIS is as ubiquitous as the internet is today.  Everyone uses it--they do business there, they go to school there, and, of course, they play games there.<br /><br />But there is one game that supercedes all the others.  James Halliday, late inventor of the OASIS, has hidden an Easter egg somewhere within the vast virtual space.  The person that finds it will inherit his vast fortune and, more importantly, control of the OASIS itself.  Halliday was a huge fan of everything 80's, so the riddles and challenges in the quest for the egg are an exercise in 80's nostalgia.  (Technically I'm about a decade too young to appreciate this book, but I got enough of it.)<br /><br />An entire subculture of egg hunters (shortened to \\"gunters\\") has coalesced around the search for the egg.  But there are also corporations bent on finding the egg first and controlling the OASIS for their own means.  Wade Watts is the person to unravel the first clue in the hunt, and when he does, he and his small band of sometime-allies, sometime-rivals learn just how far certain people are willing to go to find the egg first.<br /><br />Ready Player One earned five stars from me not because it is fine literature--it's not--but because it is compulsively readable.  It's the geek version of The Da Vinci Code--the underdog hero has to find and solve a series of puzzles in order to beat the bad guys to the prize.  But unlike The Da Vinci Code, I actually cared about the characters and the obstacles they faced.  Wade's personal story is satisfying in itself, but ultimately the book is all about the spectacle.  In a virtual world anything can happen, and it does--where else would you find anime-style giant robots battling beside wizards and mages for control of an impenatrable castle?<br /><br />I have numerous minor quibbles with the book, but none of them are really worth complaining about, because the fact is that I was hooked from the start and went gleefully along for the ride.  If you're a geek like me, I think you will too.
B007FH9GT2|1.0|I enjoyed the original Swedish film - in fact preferred it to the book.<br />I am not sure I would have followed this version if I had not read the book first.<br />Some of the acting was good - especially Salander - while Daniel Craig was wooden/one dimensional.<br />Definitely a film to rent and not buy and one that will only be watched once.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain does a great job of using evidence-based research that calls into question society's (and sometimes psychology's) false assumption that the outgoing, aggressive, individual should be our model of psyhological health. She identifies and validates the strengths of those with quieter, more sensitive dispositions. A great read for anyone who's teacher had concerns that he or she was \\"shy.\\"
B0071DJZZA|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is clearly a retelling of \\"Battle Roayle\\" but extremely compressed with some interesting twists. I found it an easy \\"read\\" but I did notice many instances of poor editing - missed punctuation. incorrect verb tenses, and the like. The kind of thing that would not be caught by most \\"public edition\\" word processors; yes there is a place for human proofreaders still in this modern world. I finished the book in two days - I could not put it down. It is written in a very \\"graphic novel\\" style, with good imagery and not an overly complex weaving of story lines. Maybe not \\"highbrow\\" enough for some, but I am sure the teen and tween market will find it a \\"good read.\\" Yes there is gore and some very subdued sexual tension, but look around any middle school these days and you'll see many of the same tensions. The primary character, a young woman, is a real \\"action figure.\\" No steamy \\"love scenes\\" and no really heavy gore, but still enough action to hold the reader. If you give it to your \\"tween\\" or \\"teen\\" talk to them first about ways to resolve conflict, and remind them the book is fiction.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Doesn't make any sense. At least not to me. I'd rather play for FREE on my phone than paying $2.99 for the same exact game.
0553386816|5.0|As expected from all of his books, John Grisham's Ford Country is excellent reading.  It is good to read a book without all of the vulgar language and slang that so many modern day writers feel they have to insert into their books and why I usually put them down before completing and do not purchase any more by that particular author.  He writes about very believable experiences and it is difficult to put the book down before I am finished.<br /><br />Delivery was quick as always from items purchased from Amazon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an AWESOME book/trilogy. Read it last December, and even though is getting attention based on the sex scenes, this trilogy IS NOT ABOUT \\"THAT\\"!<br />It's about uncondional love, acceptance, growth, commitment, self-respect, but above all is learning to love and loving your partner with all your might. It IS NOT a cheap erotica read. it's a very deep constructed set of characters. YOU FEEL EVRYTHING Anna does or feel.<br /> It's a DEEP look into damaged, low self-steem, but it's also a very deep trilogy about LOVE. The sex element that's on the trilogy is just a bonus interesting look on something that most of us doesn't even want to know. Nothing against the style (but it's not for me), and \\"that\\" NEVER detracted from being an EXCELENT ready for me. Hands down THE BEST romantic trilogy in my last 20 years of reads! Yes, it's THAT great!<br />Don't read negative reviews, forget about \\"badly written\\" comments. (which is not, btw), and immerse yourself. Everybody will fall in love with Christian and Anna.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game so much. It so great! it works fine on the kindle fire. When ever I'm board I just take.it out and play! : )
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app has many different options, they are amazing, like math problems, and shaking the device to get the snooze. great app for a person who has to wake up early.

B00008S2VH|4.0|The Madonna's American Life Special Limited Edition consists of a box including the CD album with 11 music tracks and an enhanced one, I haven't been able to run the enhanced track on my computer, this functionality might have expired, the CD artwork is different from the regular version, it has the same image as the album cover, besides that the box also contais a 23\\"x35\\" poster, on one side it has the album cover on big size and on the other side it has the same images that are on the booklet of the regular version on a paper that resembles a newspaper, it is not definitely a premium quality paper and a stamp sheet with the image of album cover again but this time on stamp size. All the stamps have the same image.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|The alex rider series is the most AWSOME series ever is part supense,trill,and action.It is worth every  penny you spend 5 stars
B0061S073A|5.0|this app is well awesome. its perfect for all ages my 2 year old and 2 brothers ages 9 and 10 use it. its easy enough to change which apps are accessable depending on who's using it. my brothers couldent even tell I had blocked them and its simple enough for my 2 year old I reccomend this app to any one.
B0039N74CW|5.0|This is a Great Movie, especially the Donkey. Everytime he opened up his mouth he busted me up with laughter.  Shrek #2 was not nearly as good, but you can't go wrong with this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Throughout the first two books, it's quite evident that the love triangle will inevitably be decided, along with a war we know needs to have an end. I have to admit that I expected a plot twist similar to the one that actually happened, but I'm left... depressed. Even though it was an amazing book, and it was extremely realistic in the way the author portrayed post-traumatic stress disorder, and people's realistic reactions to thing, I felt that the epilogue could have helped the readers not only understand how it's hard to live after you've lost so much, but that at least in all that sadness and lack of life, there would at least be a flicker of genuine happiness that she even had children. After having to be convinced. For many years.<br /><br />The biggest part of the book and the most important to understand is this: A hero is not just someone who looks good, is helpful and brave. It's someone who will put everything on the line for what they believe in.<br /><br />That is exactly what Katniss does. She may not want to, but she knows that it's important to many others that she does. And the author did an amazing job to show that not everything the hero has can be kept. It's impossible to fight such a horrific war and not have people lost in the battle. As any military family knows, even though there's an amazing hero to give us hope and courage, they also have an immense amount of loss and traumatic events to live with.<br /><br />I am quite sad by what happens in the book, but I understand that not all stories about heroes can have happy endings. Not everyone or everything can be saved. And never can one see such terrible things, and have to partake in such gruesome acts, and still come out all peppy and resilient. It's a miracle she even goes on the way she does.<br /><br />Overall - the battles and struggles these characters go through will give their next generations something to study, love, respect, and maybe fight stronger for.<br /><br />And let the odds be ever in their favor.be ever in their favor.
B00792EGES|5.0|I simply cannot comprehend why these guys are not bigger in the United States. Myles, Mark, Scott and Brian are all at the pinnacle of what a true artist is in their own respects. I will forever be an Alter Bridge fan! \m/<br /><br />This Blu Ray is extremely high quality--the production team hit a grand slam. DTS-High Definition Audio. IS. AMAZING. Do yourself a favor and get a A/V Receiver with this sound decoder if you don't have one already (Denon, Pioneer, Yamaha, Marantz, etc.).<br /><br />The video quality is also awesome. The light show is amazing. 1080p baby!<br /><br />I've seen Alter Bridge live several times, and I would have given anything to have been there at Wembley. They always sound great live, but I think they put their best efforts into this performance not only because they were at Wembley, but because they were making history. That was recorded with some of the best equipment available. Win. Win. Win!<br /><br />Highly highly recommended!<br /><br />--Rhys M.<br /><br />Side note: This Blu Ray was put together much better than the Alter Bridge: Live in Amsterdam Blu Ray. Can't wait for the 3D version in the Summer!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Whatever happened to happy endings?  As the books progress the characters get more and more depressing and the story line is so filled with sadness and hardship.  Do not read this to feel good, read to finish the trilogy.  Would never have read this book by itself and did read it only out of curiosity (I wanted to finish the story).  Ug, almost makes me sorry I began reading the first book!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great way to pass time. It is very addictive I would recommend it to anyone looking to pass time and have fun..
B00756GKBA|5.0|After the dismal Hard Candy, its lack luster reviews and poor world wide sales, Madonna has returned to her roots and created great electronica dance music once again. She is pushing the boundaries of dance music instead of riding its current wave. We all hoped and prayed this day would come......Madonna is back with full dance force and fury.<br /><br /> The songs are perfectly crafted gems, using the full range and emotions of her voice. She is in fine voice and the vocal performances sound inspired. For those who have only heard the underwhelming lead single GMAYL, will be pleasantly surprised with the rest of the CD. That one song does not define the rest of this masterpiece. The songs have attitude, playful humor and youthful energy through out. Her marriage and its demise sent her into a creative song writing frenzy and delivers some of her best material in over a decade. The melodies here will linger in your minds, long after the music stops playing. Madonna has given us songs with strong melodic hooks and no fillers, with stand out tracks like the raunchy and tough, Gang Bang. The beat pulsates with a sinister S&M thump as she spews threats like a dominatrix with venomous attitude. Turn up the Radio is pure dance fun, a must to listen at the gym while working out. Masterpiece is a tender ballad accompanied with strings and minimal production. Her voice is gorgeous and ethereal on this track. Girl Gone Wild is sassy fun that makes you want to hit the dance floor and sweat till your are spent with exhaustion. The glowing positive reviews from critics is a prediction that this year will be the year of Madonna! Welcome back Madge, we've missed you!
B005UG542S|5.0|I LOVE the books, and I certainly enjoyed the series as well, I'm presently collecting all the movies.  It was very well done.  And naturally the books give more, but it's still fun to watch events play out on the screen.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I am one of those people who hasn't a bad word to say about Jodi Piccoult, because she is one of those writers who addresses gruesome issues head on and manages not make you shiver in revulsion. As with all her books, there are a number of stories woven into one, and the theme - a bullied teen killer who takes his revenge on his school - is sadly becoming a more familiar occurance in recent times.
B003AKLFAG|1.0|A few scenes were worth watching and the protagonist is a good enough actor, but the story is horrid.  If it's free, it might be worth the two hours of your life, but please don't pay for this.
B001HC8516|5.0|This book was phenomenal! I read it right after a breakup and I learned that I received an excuse. He's not getting a second chance, ever. I don't care how many times he claims he loves me. If he truly loved me, he'd at least be able to look me in the eye now.
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is in my opinion MADONNA'S best album ever.  I LOVE every song on this cd.  \\"GANG BANG\\" is definitely my favorite but there are many highlights on this album, listening to it over and over and over again, I see GRAMMYS, lol....
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Let's cut right to the chase. I'm getting stable results with the buffer set to 48 samples in Ableton Live recording at 48/24. That's outstandingly low latency for a usb interface and comparable to the RME babyface. Now, I haven't used the babyface personally, but based on my experience with RME products in general, I'd expect the babyface to provide the best latency of any usb interface, but the scarlett 2i2 is a fraction of the price and gives the babyface a run for its money. For the record, I'm using the beta driver 2.3.128.0 (from beta.focurite.com) with a quad core desktop that's a few years old running Windows 7 32 bit home.<br /><br />I use the interface primarily to record my guitar. Since I'm using VST amplifier emulation and monitoring the guitar on the computer output, latency is my primary concern. My guitar sound is pretty mangled, so I can't really judge the quality of the preamps that everybody raves about, but it all sounds good to me.<br /><br />I don't use any external MIDI devices, so I don't mind the lack of MIDI ports, and 2 ins and stereo output is sufficient for me. I appreciate the small form factor, USB bus power, gain knobs for each input and separate volume knobs for the monitors and the headphones. I've used USB interfaces from Akai, Line6, Tascam, ART, and M-Audio. The scarlett has the lowest latency in my experience and is nearly as good in latency as the PCI interfaces from RME and M-Audio I've used.<br /><br />The downsides are few. With the latest drivers there is no 16 bit option, you are limited to 24 bit. I'm of the opinion that 16 bit is sufficient, so I'd like the option, but I doubt that many people care. I think that and the lack of MIDI jacks are about it. Highly recommended.
B0071WQ7WU|2.0|So I listened to this album straight through 4 times yesterday and I really wanted to like it as I have been a Shinedown fan from the beginning. Unfortunately this one has disappointed me and it will be the first Shinedown Album I don't purchase (Listened to it on MOG). I had very high hopes and knew it was unlikely they could top Sound of Madness however this seems like 5 steps back. There weren't any songs that grabbed my like on past Shinedown Albums. Hopefully the next one is much better until then I will continue to listen to the rest of their collection.

B0045EJY90|5.0|This CD player/recorder works like a true pro. It has all the functions of a traditional CD player plus the USB port makes it a snap to hook up my iPad or iPhone. The sound through the USB is as good as the quality of the MP3 file you are playing. Teac has long been associated with pro equipment and this one is no exception. The buttons on the front are arranged in logical order. We use it in our TV studio and it works great. Just get a real good USB to iPhone cable to go with it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i think one game is hard the soccer bounce one but other wiise its awesome.i really love this game. the easiest is the Romeo and Juliet.its such a great game its awesome
0525423656|1.0|Well, there's not much more than that to say.  My 13 year old daughter and I both read the first book and enjoyed it, so we ordered the second one.  We both love to read and we both HATED IT.  My 13 year old daughter can't even finish it and summed it up as \\"It's so boring mom.  Cassia is on some farm and Ky is at some place where they are firing down on people, and I just can't get into it.\\"  I forced myself to finish it, but it was very painful.  Like other reviewers said, the characters aren't the same, Ky and Cassia are totally annoying and boring.  The new characters just annoyed me as well and seemed so flat.  And can I just say how very much I HATE Condie's constant attempt at poetry when trying to describe the character's thoughts on every freaking page???? Like every other sentence is some fluffy garbage like \\"I felt like a flower wilting while watching the dew of our relationship evaporate.\\"  Ok so that's not an exact line from the book but I swear to you every page is like that.  It's great to have characters be introspective and reflect once in a while, but every other sentence of the whole book, PLEASE JUST SHUT UP AND HAVE SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPEN OR SAY OR DO SOMETHING WORTH READING!!!!!  Save your money and buy and read a different book, trust me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun to keep playing different games!! if never gets boring because of the fact that they have so many different games!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I wish the google tasks site worked like this app!  Remarkable! Great features for organizing work and home tasks.  I love the widget too!  Easy to sync(best feature of all).  I got this free from Amazon, but will always be on my \\"must have\\" list on all my devices.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|this is a good game but it is force crashing on the HTC incredible.  cant wait for new levels to be released.
B005XY67WI|5.0|My wife is a big Shakira fan, so I got this for her.. Me? Not really a Shakira fan... BUT I must give credit where credit is due... WHAT AN INCREDIBLE CONCERT!!! We enjoyed it immensely, and totally recommend it for both Shakira fans, and for those like me who just enjoy a good musical show.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I've been super happy with the quality of audio I now get with my TM700. Compact like my camera and easy to get out into the field which is what I needed! Excellent choice for upgrading audio!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I'll start off by saying that I'll probably be mentioning some **SPOILERS** here and there.<br /><br />There were plenty of things I liked about the book, but there were far too many things I found either annoying or tiresome. For example, the timing. It's as if Collins was trying to fast forward through the whole first half of the book. One minute Katniss is walking through the Seam, upset about something, in the very next sentence a WHOLE MONTH went by and she's at home and depressed or something. I can't remember if that's exactly how it went, but you see the point I'm trying to make? Collins made little jumps like that quite often. I kept having to go back and reread chapters to understand what the heck just happened.<br /><br />Also, maybe it's because of the bad confusing time lapsing going on, but it just seemed like Katniss' state of depression and moodiness just lasted forever. And her LEVEL of fear by just the sight of the president is a little much. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe she's suffering from sort of PTSD that I didn't quite catch onto.<br /><br />And I get so angry over her attitude towards Peeta and how he's treated.<br /><br />The fact that they return to the arena actually doesn't bother me, though. I thought it would, but with a whole bunch of new players and characters to get to know, I enjoyed it. And the arena itself was very interesting. More so than the first in my opinion.<br /><br />Like I said, all in all, I did find this an enjoyable book. Once you get passed the time lapses and learn to deal with the constant moodiness in the half. Overall, it still kept my attention. I'll probably read it again.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I bought this app after a great deal of research on calendar apps for my Kindle Fire. I have several Google calendars across several accounts that I manage on iCal and on my Android phone. My iPad could handle all these calendars, but once I switched to the Fire I really thought I would be stuck with only accessing my Google calendars online.<br /><br />I am happy to report that CalenGoo handles it all like a champ. Set up was a cinch, and it syncs super fast. I've had it for a couple of weeks, and have had zero problems. There are a wealth of custom settings and once I dove into those, I got my calendar looking almost as sleek as it did on the iPad. I also switched to CalenGoo from Business Calendar on my phone, taking advantage of the wide array of widgets. I love keeping things consistent, so I really appreciate the fine grained customization of the app.<br /><br />Final word: if you want a calendar app that will handle all your Google calendars, offer lots of options and user control, and look sleek and professional, then CalenGoo is the deal.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|I am not going to be able to improve on several of the great reviews already posted here. But I second the four and five star reviews.<br /><br />We watch a ton of movies and about half are Indie or small house movies or foreign. (The rest are evenly split between Sci Fi {for me} Superhero {for my partner} Animated {for me} and old and goofy {for my partner}). Both of this really liked this. I think I did more than he did...which is probably due to my actual profession: Children's Librarian. I work with a lot of kids and teens and I quite liked this.<br /><br />If you are a fan of sardonic teen lit you will enjoy this.<br /><br />It wasn't until after the movie was over that I realized that the girl was Yasmin Paige who I adored in the first season of the Sarah Jane Adventures. She was great!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|David Fincher, once again, proves why he's one of this era's best filmmakers. The acting is also amazing too with Rooney Mara receiving a well deserved Oscar nomination for her work as Lisbeth Salander. She really created more of a three dimensional character than how she was portrayed in the Swedish films, which came across to me as little more than a one dimensional punk chick with the same angry expression and the same haircut. It didn't feel as real to me as this portrayal of Lisbeth Salander did.

B0071WQ7WU|4.0|Released this morning, \\"Amaryllis\\" is the 4th studio album produced by Shinedown. Shinedown allowed the entire album to be streamed on iTunes for free last week and since then I have listened to the full album from start to finish at least a dozen times. This is going down as Shinedown's best album; I think that distinction will probably still stay with \\"Leave a Whisper\\" but Amaryllis is really good. Here is track-by-track review as I see it:<br /><br />1. Adrenaline [10/10] - A very strong start for \\"Amaryllis\\". This track is exactly what you would expect to start the album off - heavy hitting and fast paced. This track can go toe-to-toe with every other Shinedown opener - and Shinedown fans know there is some good competition there (Fly from the Inside, Heroes)<br /><br />2. Bully [9/10] - The first single from the album. I'll admit I wasn't sure how I felt about this song when I heard it back in January however it has grown on me since hearing how it fits in with the rest of the album. Bully continues right where Adrenaline leaves off, keeping up the pace and the attitude.<br /><br />3. Amaryllis [10/10] - I love this track (it may be one of my new all-time favorites from Shinedown). The instrumentals and lyrics fit together really well, and I think Brent really shines in this song. It's not a rocker like the first two tracks but that's alright, this is the other side of Shinedown (and it's great).  Would love to hear this song in another set like \\"Anything and Everything\\" (see \\"Somewhere in the Stratosphere\\" DVD).<br /><br />4. Unity [8/10] - There is nothing wrong with this song, but I think it could be labeled as the most cliché of the first four tracks. I don't feel the need to skip this track necessarily, but I hope it doesn't end up becoming a single; if it does I think it may become one of those tracks that get tiresome after awhile. Like Amaryllis, it's toned down from the beginning of the album and probably qualifies as a ballad.<br /><br />5. Enemies [9/10] - Here is where we pick up the energy again. I know some people will hate this comparison (and no I don't think Nickelback can at all be compared to Shinedown) but I really could definitely see this song on a Nickelback album; Brent even sounds a bit like Chad when he is screaming enemies near the end of the song. It's another solid rocker and fits in well at this point in the album.<br /><br />6. I'm Not Alright [10/10] - This might be my favorite track on the entire album. Shinedown shows their ability as musicians by including horns (trumpets?) on this track. I know that doesn't seem like it should work, but it comes together brilliantly and really adds to the feel-good feeling I associate with this track. My only complaint about this track is that I think it ends too quickly -leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />7. Nowhere Kids [10/10] - Another rocker and another option for my favorite track on the album. According to what I've seen on iTunes this morning this seemed to be the least popular track on the album so far. This was another one that took some time to grow on me (like Bully) but now I think it's fantastic. The backing vocals when Zach and Eric are screaming `Nowhere Kids' are great. I'm guessing a lot of people are thrown off by the use of the `f-bomb' in the chorus.<br /><br />8. Miracle [7/10] - Probably the next single off of the album. There isn't anything I can point to about this song that is wrong, but I am sure the record companies......err, Shinedown will make this the next single off of Amaryllis. If this happens I could see this song becoming one of the big hits of the summer (consequently making me want to rip my ears off every time I hear it four times in a single hour).<br /><br />9.I'll Follow You [6/10] - In my opinion the only misstep on the entire album (which is a shame because it starts out really promising). For me it's the chorus that really makes me want to skip this track when it comes on. Perhaps it will grow on me but Idon't think so. It's a slower song, but picks up during the chorus.<br /><br />10. For My Sake [8/10] - This is a solid contribution to the album; nothing great but nothing wrong either. It's not a ballad, but it doesn't keep pace with tracks like Adrenaline, Bully, Enemies, or Nowhere Kids. I think it helps the album transition well towards the conclusion.<br /><br />11. My Name (Wearing Me Out) [9/10] - I really enjoy this song, and I think it's a bit of a gem at this point in the album. I think it saves the album from fading down the stretch, however I am sure some people won't like because of the profanity. This is one I would think will fit well in a concert set and I would love to hear live.<br /><br />12. Through the Ghost [8/10] - A solid finish to \\"Amaryllis\\". This isn't `45' - but we shouldn't expect it to be; however it does a good job of bringing the album to a close. It's a slower song and I really like the instrumentals (the vocals don't really do much for me). It does seem to get a little dragged out towards the end.<br /><br />In conclusion I think \\"Amaryllis\\" is great coming out of the gate but it stumbles a bit in the second half; however it does so much well it is hard not to like this album. Overall I do think it is better than \\"The Sound of Madness\\" and \\"Us and Them\\" but I don't think it can compete track-for-track with \\"Leave a Whisper\\". For what it's worth I have listened to this album almost non-stop for a week already and I don't expect that to stop anytime soon. If you have been a fan of Shinedown in the past I don't think this album will do anything to change your opinion of them and will be a good addition to your music collection.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|First off I am a big fan so I am going to put it like this did they reinvent the wheel here no is this a solid disc most deff.Shinedown is one of the most straight forward pull no punches bands around today. I like the cd from front to back and do not have to skip tracks. The whole vibe here is very groove laiden in my opinion the lyrics have a little more depth to them. It has some nice epic sound. I often wonder when people slag a new release that do they really listen to it or do they just skim through and then cry and complain that it is not like Sound of Madness or so fourth. Who wants the same cd over and over again. I myself am going through alot personally and this cd helps to numb my pain and gives me hope and that is what real music does it takes you to a different place! Shinedown I tip my hat to you for a job well done!!!!!!

0439023491|4.0|I actually found the vulnerability in Katniss in book 2 made her a better  and more believable character. Not weak and whiny as some reviewers have stated. I found her cold and perfunctory in Hunger Games, didn't warm to her at all. I preferred Peeta because he had more heart. but Book 2 makes Katniss so much more relatable. she's  doesn't have a heart of stone and she's not as strong as she makes out to be. She is only just 16 after all. In hunger games she's resigned to the fact that she won't survive the Arena. She's got nothing to lose but her own life, she doesn't even have Peeta to worry about until the very end. In the Arena, she's in her element and we know she's strong there, but for most of book 2 she has to play politics and make friends which Collins has pointed out in HG that she's crap at. In book 2 she's suddenly got to worry about her family, Gale and the whole of District 12 and 11 for that matter.Plus she's carrying around alot more emotional baggage. What 16 year old wouldn't be a complete mess given the circumstances. Its not like she could diffuse the whole situation by shooting arrows or hunting game. This is where some of the adult characters step up and make a presence ie. Haymitch, Katniss' mother, Cinna, I mean how believable is it that a mere 16 year old has the maturity to navigate the complex social issues and orchestrate a revolution on her own? So kudos to Ms. Collin for bringing Katniss down to earth.<br /><br />On the whole love triangle part, being in my 30's and not the target teen audience I don't see why there is so much angst about who's the real keeper (Peeta IMO) but I like that Collins has made Katniss quite self reliant' in the way that she's not keen on being anyone's girlfriend despite liking physical/emotional comfort from Gale/Peeta. Its clear she doesn't want to tie herself down (for the moment) with either boy (Finally, the antithesis of Bella Swan). If only those two boys would stop messing with her mind and trying to kiss her silly.<br /><br />The novel on its own is not as exciting as HG but on a whole it is better written with more character development that HG lacks. Some might find it dull and repetitive given all the action in HG. but I like that Collins has taken the time to expand other characters, mainly Haymitch and Peeta. (Poor Gale still comes across as a minor B character though) Its is rather the 'Empire Strikes Back' in the trilogy, setting the scene for the final installment. All I can say is MockingJay better deliver the goods.kiss her silly.<br /><br />The novel on its own is not as exciting as HG but on a whole it is better written with more character development that HG lacks.

B00280LYHS|5.0|This novel is a well written end to the threat of Kronos, the arch-nemesis. It includes fun adventure and humor to off-set the the grim nature of an epic final battle. The ending closes this series but also allows for the story to be continued.
B0041B785Y|5.0|I have always had a love/hate relationship when it comes to Meshuggah. Some of the albums/songs I love and others, well, I hate. For example, I love Obzen, could listen to it daily, but I can't stand Catch Thirty Three...you catch my drift. That being said, I LOVE KOLOSS. In fact, I love each and every track on Koloss. From the very beginning 'I am colossus' slaps you in the face with the low, groovy, bone-crushing riffage that Meshuggah are known for. To date, this is my favorite Meshuggah album and Koloss is quickly becoming one of my favorite metal albums of all time. If you are a fan of Meshuggah, or if you have liked a few tunes here and there, give this album a spin, it will rip your face off.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been at least 20 years since I stayed up until 3 am to finish a book. If you're looking for a good story that sucks you in from the first page and doesn't let go, then look no further.

1932100660|5.0|I personally read the book months ago and since then I have recommended it to any and everyone who would listen. It is the book of the century because it deals with the overall deteriorating health of Americans and what we can do about it. Our eating habits are making us sick and we are dying prematurely because of it.<br /><br />I received the book from Amazon and it got to me within days through the USPS.<br /><br />Martine
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|I heard Charles Bradley on XM21- Little Steven's Underground Garage. They were cool to give him some exposure. He has a powerful voice and a great band behind him. To come out with your debut album when you are 63 is unusual. He got his break through<br />Dap King Records (Sharon Jones label). Give him a chance, great soul singer!

0307352145|4.0|but found this book worthwhile.  Cain weaves a a well-written combination of relevant anecdotes, scientific studies, and personal observation and analysis to produce what I found to be mostly a pep talk for introverts. My being one obviously pushed me toward a positive opinion of the book. However, whatever your personality, you will benefit from a \\"Quiet\\" read because it speaks to how best to interact with introverts in both employment and social settings. And it gets you thinking about yourself a lot, and who doesn't like to do that.
B000OEZ88G|4.0|One of the most prominent business and management books in recent history is the 1994 book Built to Last by James Collins and Jerry Porras.  In the work, the authors focused on eighteen companies and what made them so visionary and successful.  To do so, they analyzed these companies with a primary competitor in order to determine what made them stand out.  Through their extensive, six-year period of research, the authors were able to identify a number of key themes that seemed to connect all of these companies for what made them \\"built to last.\\"<br />Collins and Porras define a visionary company as having six distinctive qualities: they must be premier institutions in their respective industries; the companies should be widely admired by knowledgeable businesspeople; they should have made an indelible imprint on the world; the companies must have gone through multiple generations of chief executives; they must have gone through multiple product life cycles; and finally, the companies they studied all were founded before 1950.  With the eighteen firms having these qualities, Collins and Porras explained that the companies were engaging in \\"clock building\\" while developing their company.<br />I found this book to be a very worthwhile read.  Indeed, I feel that this should be mandatory reading for all students moving through the MBA program.  I also believe that some of the negative criticism the book has received is due to the fact that the research project was a massive undertaking by the authors; there is much to praise, but much to criticize as well.  Nevertheless, I found much of the book to be highly informative about what drives a company to be built to last over many generations.  Indeed, as the authors stated, they were not attempting to write a \\"how to\\" guide of how to build a successful company; but rather, the underlying themes of the visionary companies provide compelling evidence for how they were able to last over many generations.<br /> Ultimately I believe that Collins and Porras provided an in-depth, informative analysis on the unifying characteristics of some visionary companies.  While some of the research may be questionable and while some of the conclusions can be challenged, this appears to be more the nature of business management analysis as opposed to any major flaws in their conclusions.  Indeed, throughout the various themes presented by the authors, Collins and Porras provided a clear, worthwhile, and important analysis of how a company can maintain a core ideology while stimulating progress in order to be successful for many generations.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Scott and Zelda (no last name needed for Jazz Age aficionados, right?), Cole Porter, T.S. Eliot, Man Ray, Pablo Picasso, hell even Djuana Barnes are names from the Jazz Age and the American post- World War I ex-paraite night that get bandied about in Woody Allen's 2011 comedic effort, Midnight In Paris. There were plenty of other names dropped as well but the above popped out in memory's eye and serve my point. This film is a paen to that by-gone age just far enough back for Woody (and me) to not have been splashed by the Jazz Age karma but wishing, wishing like crazy, we could have lived at that time -in that city, Paris and been washed by the spectacular antics and struggles that went on there to create a modern literary and cultural world. And in the end that is Woody's point, as he has one of his throw-back jazz Age characters pine for an even earlier time- the last quarter of the 19th century-La Belle Epogue. Nice spin, Woody.<br /><br />But to the plot that brings this whole thing together in magic realistic way and without being too ham-handed on the \\"moral\\". Woody (oops) Gil (played with some Woody-like physical and expressive mannerism by Owen Wilson) is a thouroughly modern frustrated Hollywood screenwriter who yearns to write the great American novel, or at least something other than the drivel that passes for language in most of his screenwriting. He and his fiancé, Inez (played by Rachael McAdams), are in Paris on a lark before getting married. Gil loves Paris, his version of Paris, the Paris of the American ex -pat 1920s Jazz Age when the great creative spirits of the early 20th century held forth and lit up the cultural post-war wasteland night.  Inez is a little, no, a lot more bourgeois, and just wants Gil to keep making the kale so they can afford that high-end La-La land lifestyle. This will no be a match made in heaven, no question.<br /><br />Gil though through cinematic magical realism finds his way back to the Paris of the 1920s around midnight each night and from there is able to find his true self, or what he thinks is his true self. Naturally a women (Pablo Picasso's, mistress, or one of them) is there to goad him along but also to pose the question about what craving for earlier unattainable times mean. In the end Gil is \\"liberated\\" from Inez (she was two-timing him anyway with some pedantic prof) and can walk the rainy 2010s streets of Paris and really make his literary breakthrough. This is one of  Woody's better recent efforts. Proof. A person whom I respect very much as a cinematic aficionado said this is the first Woody Allen film that she could sit through to the end and wish that it didn't end. High praise indeed.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very similar to the classic. Very good. Starts very easily but gets challenging. I recommend it to anyone who liked and played the old Missile Command.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Easy to install. Fits well. Seems like it would keep your Kindle Fire well protected within your purse or back-pack. Only 3 stars because the \\"stand\\" feature is very flimsy. There is no latch and the ledge that the cover has to catch on is very small. If you just want to sit it on a sturdy surface you should be fine, but you will not be using the stand on an uneven or moving surface like your lap or in bed.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I was captivated for the first half of the book.....then it started to unravel for me.  I found myself sorry that I wanted to know what happened, yet felt it was almost a waste of time.  Some things just didn't add up.....how can Laurie be married to someone and never ask about his family?  That is one of the big premises of the book, that he was secretive about his father and she's someone who believes in \\"talk, talk talk\\", and yet she lives with a man who discloses nothing about his past? I'm sorry, but that just seems impossible to me.  It was an interesting story line......but it just didn't come together for me.
0316098329|4.0|Really enjoyed ROOM and highly recommend other books by this author.<br /><br />The POV of the little boy is both charming and horrifying as his mother struggles to keep life as normal for him as possible in the worst of all circumstances.<br /><br />I must say I enjoyed the author's book, SLAMMERKIN, even more. She pulls no punches with her young characters.<br /><br />Emma's choice of subject is not lightweight fare in either book, but she deals with it without excess drama and angst, without losing the edgy darkness the makes the story compelling.<br /><br />I will pick up her other works without hesitation
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have never written a review before today but I feel compelled to for this book! I'm not much of a avid reader but when I heard some one had written a book with Avett quotes and references I was bought! This book will draw you and consume you!!!

076115678X|5.0|I was unsure about buying this book because I have what I thought was only slightly wavy hair, and the book seemed to be oriented more toward people with definitely curly hair. I am very glad I took the risk and bought it. There is an entire chapter devoted to the Curly Girl method for wavy hair. I only started using the method a few days ago, but already my hair is much wavier than I ever realized. I can't believe it's my own natural hair in the mirror! I am excited to see how my hair will look after a few weeks.<br /><br />The book doesn't really recommend specific products, only ingredients to avoid in products. It is not necessary to use expensive products, such as the DevaCurl system; I'm using only drugstore products. There are online communities devoted to curly hair that I've found helpful for identifying specific products.<br /><br />The book contains a lot of anecdotes from curly-haired women (and a few men), which were interesting to read, but I didn't really relate to personally, having hair that, prior to Curly Girl, appeared to be basically straight. The book is oriented more toward people with curly hair, but still has a lot of great information for wavy hair. If you're on the fence about this book, I would highly recommend buying it and giving the CG method a try.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a psychologist friend because I expressed an interest in the relationship between teenage angst, mental illness and violence towards self or others. This book captured my imagination from the first moment, and I have to say, it caught me by surprise not just once, but twice. That hasn't happened in a very long time that I can recall. As a mother of a child who had experienced disturbing thoughts, it was a chilling, emotional, frightening read. I discovered partway through, to my great relief, it was a work of fiction.  I highly recommend this well-written book, even though I wouldn't ordinarily recommend what I do consider to be a disturbing read.

B00756GKBA|4.0|Every Madonna album is anticipated highly, but it would seem a particular lot is riding on \\"MDNA.\\" It is her first album of original material in four years, marking the longest pause she has ever taken between studio albums, and the first to see release in the wake of the globe-saturating success of Lady Gaga, her frighteningly clear heir apparent. It also marks her debut on the Interscope/Live Nation imprint after a nearly 30-year tenure with Warner Bros., the label that launched her into the stratosphere.<br /><br />If these facts have caused Madonna even the slightest hint of worry, \\"MDNA\\" shows none of it. Rather than sounding desperate for a hit or eager to prove she still reigns supreme of all divas, she is relaxed, adventurous and quite willing to take chances, like a tyke let loose in a toy shop. Even when the performances turn serious and clenched, it is only for the sake of the songs themselves. Where the results are not her usual musical candy corn, which is often, they are always intriguing. The lack of sweat on her brow makes it clear - why prove what has already been proven? There's only one Queen of Pop, and that's Madonna.<br /><br />\\"MDNA\\" pulses with a high sonic energy which only somewhat belies the turmoil of the lyrics since the grooves are steely, not frenetic. Heartbreak, redemption and self-fulfillment are among the chief themes. This is miles away from the soft core porn of \\"Hard Candy\\" or the deliberately visceral \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor,\\" which was less about depth than disco lights, and her most personal work since \\"Ray of Light.\\" William Orbit, who honed much of that album, returns here.<br /><br />Orbit not only bathes Madge in shimmering, atmospheric soundscapes, but clearly elicits her to mark new territory and self-efface. \\"I'm a Sinner\\" is exemplary with its chaotic world music beats, cheeky lyrics and modulated vocal technique, and the kick-ass \\"Some Girls\\" sounds both retro and futuristic with its sharp, swirling synths.<br /><br />Benny Benassi places Madonna squarely on the dance floor with the monstrously hooky, hi-BPM, often lyrically oddball second single \\"Girl Gone Wild.\\" \\"I'm Addicted,\\" a zippy, unhinged dose of aggressive obsession, sounds like Kylie Minogue's \\"Rippin' Up the Disco.\\"<br /><br />Martin Solveig maximizes Madonna's commercial savvy without obscuring her idiosyncrasies. \\"Turn Up the Radio\\" brims with hit potential, yet takes no cues from younger, decidedly hipper chart busters. The syllable-bursting, high-tension \\"I Don't Give A\\" blasts through her own inner wall of anxiety and affirms the take-no-prisoners attitude that Madonna is well-known for. This is a woman who digs her heels in until she conquers.<br /><br />Whether she's symbolically killing off ex-husband Guy Ritchie in the eerie, trip-hoppy \\"Gang Bang,\\" crafting a spacious, meditative melodic hook with \\"Masterpiece,\\" composing subtle re-writes of past tracks with the likes of \\"Love Spent\\" or baring her soul on the lonely, tortured, terribly icy \\"Fallin' Free,\\" Madonna remains a compelling, vital and - above all - entertaining presence on \\"MDNA.\\" It won't return her to the top of the singles charts again, but that does not matter. She has carved out a niche in the industry which suits her just fine, and \\"MDNA\\" caters to it without ever placing her too left of center, reaching out to satisfy listeners interested in what she has to offer beyond the hits.<br /><br />*** Editorial Note: The untimely loss of some of our greatest cultural icons these past few years has been absolutely heartbreaking. However we feel about \\"MDNA,\\" we should remember that we are lucky to still have Madonna here to entertain us./><br />Benny Benassi places Madonna squarely on the dance floor with the monstrously hooky, hi-BPM, often lyrically oddball second single \\"Girl Gone Wild.\\" \\"I'm Addicted,\\" a zippy, unhinged dose of aggressive obsession, sounds like Kylie Minogue's \\"Rippin' Up the Disco.\\"<br /><br />Martin Solveig maximizes Madonna's commercial savvy without obscuring her idiosyncrasies. \\"Turn Up the Radio\\" brims with hit potential, yet takes no cues from younger, decidedly hipper chart busters.

B0076NAWWA|3.0|My review disappoints me, because I really like all the players in this band and the work they've all done in the past.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were too high, but this didn't do much for me. At first I thought maybe it was because I was expecting something else. Maybe I was expecting Transatlantic with a twist. But on further reflection, the reality is that if I'd never heard of any of these guys or anything they've done, and no preconceived idea of what this might sound like, I would still have the same opinion of it.<br /><br />The songs are bland and all over the place. One song is hard and edgy, the next sounds like a blatant stab at creating something commercially viable. One song sounds like Black Country Communion, another like the Foo Fighters, others like any other dull band on the radio. I even gave this thing a chance, listening to it numerous times since yesterday. There isn't a single lyric, melody, guitar riff, drum fill or bass line that's stuck in my head. I can't recall any of it.<br /><br />Am I disappointed I downloaded it? Not necessarily. But would I have bought it if I had heard it first, no.
B004EPYZXU|1.0|This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Only the truest form of idiot would believe there was one ounce of truth to this pathetic plot.  The plot was miserable, the acting was anything but acting and the entire technical process of the movie was lacking.  I would love to read a professional media review of this disaster to see if anything I felt about the film was viewed differently.  I am a collector of film and my collection numbers in the thousands of titles and this is the only time that I could find no redeeming value in a film and decided to send it on its way to Goodwill.  A total waste of money.

006197806X|5.0|Rarely do I ever say I like a second book in a series more - but I thought this book was jam packed full of action.  I liked how the author went back and forth in the two time periods also.  Sometimes I was a little annoyed because it was left as a cliffhanger on each chapter.  The first book had a little too much romance in it for me.  That is probably why I like this book better - more action less fluff.  And the end - holy cow - I loved it!  Can't wait for the 3rd book to someday come out.  I highly recommend this book.  I'm also a big fan, of course of the hunger games, Divergent, Enclave, Blood Red Road, and Birthmarked just to name a few if you need something to read.

B007FH9GT2|1.0|Perhaps the most fitting review for this travesty is that the American movie industry has become one more abuser in a long line of misogynists who take try to control Lisbeth Salander. I knew it would be bad, but they took one of the greatest lead roles for women and turned her into a timid milksop who was either naked, trying not to look scared, or asking permission of a man to do something.<br /><br />This movie is one more sad abuse on the girl with the dragon tattoo, and if you care about women at all, do not bother to watch it.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This is a great hard rocking new release from Shinedown, that Modern Day, Hard Rock Band from Jacksonville, Florida. This album has a theme on the back of the liner notes as follows: \\"DON'T BE DELICATE...BE VAST AND BRILLIENT\\". Basically this album has a theme about \\"standing up for yourself\\". The music is generally uplifting and encouraging. Like their debut album \\"Leave a Whisper\\" had a theme in the liner notes, stating that this music is \\"For people who have in one way or another, been cast out of society\\". Shinedown continues in that same tradition on this \\"Amarylis\\" album.<br /><br />Their album \\"The Sound of Madness\\" was a GREAT album, but this \\"Amaryllis\\" album is a GREAT album also.<br /><br />Featured tracks include: \\"Bully\\" (Lead Singer, Brent Smith stated \\"this is a song that just had to be written\\") It's basically about not taking any crap from a \\"Bully\\". \\"Amaryllis\\", the title track is \\"brilliant\\" and hard rocking and so is \\"Unity\\". All the other tracks continue in the Shinedown \\"Hard Rocking\\" tradition, while the last track \\"Through The Ghost\\" is a bit milder.<br /><br />Band Members include:<br />Brent Smith - Lead vocals<br />Eric Bass - Bass, piano & backing vocals<br />Barry Kerch - Drums & percussion<br />Zach Myers - Guitars & backing vocals<br /><br />Also, there are additional backup, recording studio, session musicians, included in this Shinedown, studio album, making the music rich & deep. Plus, Brent's lead vocals continue to be \\"awesome\\".<br /><br />Remember, Jacksonville, Florida the hometown of Shinedown, is the City that spawned earlier Hard Rocking Bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Blackfoot, .38 Special, Molly Hatchet and many others. On Shinedown's Debut Album \\"Leave a Whisper\\", Shinedown covered/recorded a Lynyrd Skynyrd song, the Southern Rock Classic, \\"Simple Man\\". Their version is a lot more harder & heavier than the original Skynyrd version.<br /><br />Shinedown is currently on their \\"Amaryllis\\" 2012 tour.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just sawShinedown, live in concert at Bossier City, Louisiana, Tuesday Night, May 1, 2012 on their \\"AMARYLLIS 2012 TOUR\\". Shinedown really rocked the arena, they performed some songs from this new album \\"Amaryllis\\", and the packed crowd really loved them, especially \\"Bully\\", \\"Amaryllis\\", \\"Unity\\" & \\"Enemies\\". They also performed some of their classics, including \\"The Sound of Madness\\", The Lynyrd Skynryd Classic \\"Simple Man\\", and \\"45\\". They are a first class live band, plus they had first class concert Tee Shirts & merchandise. I love this band. ROCK ON BROTHERS & SISTERS!!!!!!!!!!

0374531269|5.0|I'm military and have been deployed twice to AFG. I've always known about the issues going on in Africa, but other than watching the movie BLOOD DIAMOND, i've never really educated myself on this part of the world.  this is the first book i've read on the region and i found it eye opening and sometimes even hard to read.  the children have had a lot put on their shoulders that most adults dont even deal with.  they deserve better.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have spent too much time inside the mind of Ana Steel. It is an open empty space. I'm just glad I didn't run into that stupid dancing goddess. By the end even the romance(?) was as annoying as her catchphrases. Might have been more interesting in the voice of Fifty then we wouldn't have to &#34;hear&#34; from Ana.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|I can strongly dislike a filmmaker as a human being, but truly enjoy the pictures that he or she makes. For example, I hate Woody Allen. I think he has a reputation that exceeds his personality. I don't think he has much of one. I think he's an old perverted creep who just happens to make completely glorious films, and the same goes for Roman Polanski. His new film \\"Carnage\\", based on a film set in New York City, had to be shot in Paris, because Polanski was literally not allowed in the United States, due to a fugitive status, due to a trial that I'm sure we're all familiar with.<br /><br />A few years ago, a friend offered me an extra ticket to a play called \\"God of Carnage\\" by someone named Yasmina Reza, and this play was a glorious thing. It lasted about 75 minutes, with no intermission, obviously. It is set around two sets of parents, whose children have a fight, and decide to meet one another to discuss this matter in a calm, civilized, polite and direct way, and end up showing their true colors, which in this case means nearly killing each other on account of different beliefs, values, a food-poisoning inducing cobbler, an ill-fated hamster, a husband who is on his cell phone too often, among many other things which build to, well, carnage.<br /><br />One thing I am happy to say is that the film version of \\"Carnage\\" is exactly like the play. It has one low-key set, and a fast, exciting screenplay that doesn't waste a single minute of its short (79 mins) running time. We never meet the children who the film revolves around, but we don't really need to, as the story at its heart, is not about the kids. It features fantastic performances by all four of its lead actors, Kate Winslet and Jodie Foster in particular. The guys (John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz) do good jobs too, but the ladies really shine in this one, having decidedly better-developed characters than the men.<br /><br />It's also pretty interesting what the movie suggests. It ends up proving that the children can patch things up and get over their differences, but the parents (the adults) cannot. The film, like the play, has no real ending, as the Winslet/Waltz couple leaves the home of the Foster/Reilly couple, nothing having been resolved. It says something about how children can often be more grown up and mature than their parents, who have never quite developed coping skills, and refuse to deal with people who don't share the same values and opinions as they do.<br /><br />Kate Winslet and Jodie Foster, having started out their careers as theater actresses, shine brightly in a picture like this, which requires a tremendously theatrical acting style, assuring that those in the cheap seats in the back feel the same impact as those who shelled out for the expensive ones. The film is, in general, loud, brash, biting, and extremely funny. You feel as if Polanski has trapped his characters in this room, forcing them to duke it out, in this battle of wits, with one another, although they could literally leave at any time. I hate Polanski, as a person, but he couldn't have done the movie any better. While this film could have been sitcommy and unrealistic, it manages to be the exact opposite. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Grade: A-

B006Z21ZGK|5.0|Iron Maiden have been the undisputed kings of metal since they hit big in the 1980s, and have enjoyed a lengthy and successful career that continues to attract more fans with every turning day, and play to sold out stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters worldwide- all without the help of mainstream attention. And in 2010, the band embarked in a rehearsal leg for the Final Frontier Tour, only to return to the stage in 2011 for a full scale, cutting edge tour, playing to several countries in several countries worldwide! And En Vivo! is a depiction of one of these spectacular shows, which shows us that even after 36 years, Maiden still rule the music world with an iron fist!<br /><br />This blu-ray really does showcase Maiden at their best. Even more amazing show is that Maiden play to a sold out crowd of 50,000 (or so Bruce says) in a large stadium setting, with a setlist based on NEW material, with a few classics thrown in there for good measure. The fans go WILD with every tune and the band's energy is just unbelievable, considering how old they are.<br /><br />The band are in top shape, folks. Bruce brings back the mic stand for the first time since 1999, but even that doesn't stop him from giving it his all here. He still runs around the stage like a hyperactive 12 year old, and, which must have had men in the audience his age reminding themselves to hit the gym. And boy, he can hit the notes better than ever! The Talisman had me wowed, and was an indicator of the amazingness to come. Adrian improvises a bit here, and it sounds damn good. And Steve, Dave and Jan? Well, amazing as aways, I can always expect the best from my favourite band knowing I'm going to get nothing but the best :) and I'm beginning to think Nicko is an alien or something. That must be the only explanation for his being able to drum that inhumanly amazing!<br /><br />I was taken a bit aback when I found out that it was shot on 22 cameras, but have no worry here, the fast edits found on DOTR and RIR are nowhere to be found. Instead, we get split screens, and that manages to make the show feel more intimate as a result. We get to see Dave play a solo! And we get to see different things at once. None of the split screens are distracting and it feels like you can actually see everything for longer than 3 seconds.<br /><br />The video quality? Absolutely superb!!! No grain to be seen at all. Shot with 22 RED cameras, the cinematography looks incredible and you can see every pore on Bruce's face, every detail of the guitars, etc. You feel like you're there At the ery front. And the HD mix? Well, it's like you're at the barrier. Just incredible.<br /><br />The special features are very sparse. There's an 88 minute documentary called Behind The Beast, which I'm saving for the weekend. There's the Satellite 15... The Final Frontier video, there's a making of featurette, and the intro video for the tour.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a MUST for any Maiden fan. Maiden have never been this amazing, and I cannot wait to see them a third time on July 27th! Ive only 3 more words to say:<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!IR are nowhere to be found.

0307279189|5.0|this is a great read and it really got me questioning myself as to how i run and what shoes i wear too.  since i read this book, i've transitioned to light, less suppportive shoes and my feet feel great.  I'm leaning towards the \\"barefoot\\" type shoes and its because of this book.  not only is it a great story, but it literally changed my life in the way and how i run.  i'm military so running is high priority.  love this book.
0545405777|1.0|I read Chapter 1 and put the book down. Unengaging and drab.<br /><br />A fan of fantasy and adventure, I thought all the cultural hype surrounding this book would point to a great read.<br /><br />The fact is, this book was written at a level meant for youths. The sentences are short and simple, and the lack of vocabulary depth makes this work more of a color-by-numbers than an oil painting.<br /><br />I shouldn't be surprised, as our culture tends to prey on elementary style book/movies for some odd reason (Harry Potter, Twilight, etc).<br /><br />Anyway, not worth my time - be sure to check the \\"Look Inside\\" before buying and you'll see what I mean.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not sure why this book gets the whiny reviews, its easily more enjoyable than than the third and forth and no less so than the first and second although I still can't say I like any of them.  The dark fantasy element is different, perhaps, and that while the Lannisters are clearly corrupt, no one else is clearly all good or all bad.  Martin is probably not even sure where the story is going and there are story lines you hope turn back up and characters you can't believe he kills off... [or some he keeps].  throuhout the 5 books the entire experience simply meanders - annoyingly at times.  Maybe its that tension that keeps the reader going?  if you want epic, readble fantasy with a story read Jordan's Wheel of Time.  A Song of Ice and Fire is something else.  I call it &#34;Rape, Pillage, Plunder, and Repeat&#34; it's more marathon fantasy and I think I'm only staying on to see if Martin can pull this off.  I question his attention span...

B006Z21ZGK|5.0|I've been seeing some rather poor reviews on this new Maiden title on several other sights.  I myself just picked up the Blu-Ray & C.D. and I must say, Go Maiden!!!  See, I caught this show when they past through Phoenix and yes, it's not really my favorite when it comes to their song line up.  However, this is the band that has never quit!!!  I'm in my 40's now and I've been a fan since 15 years old.  I've seen the good times, the bad times, and the forever changing times, yet here's MAIDEN!!!  Never quit when the going got rough and never charged me an arm and a leg just to get up by the front of the stage to get a closer view.  Not sure if everyone's up on the ticket prices these bands that quit then \\"re-start\\" back up years down the road are charging...  It's a crime and I don't get suckered into it ever!!! Iron Maiden's not charging those silly prices and I keep coming back for more.  So Iron Maiden comes out with something new with the \\"ASAP\\" attitude which their known for as of late, and it's not always a 10 star attempt.  Who cares, love it cuz they love it!!!  Roll with it cuz that's what they've always done for us!!!  Keep up the great work Maiden.  UP THE IRONS!!!
B003UDP99Q|5.0|This version of the breakthrough and landmark album is amazing sounding. The Japanese really know how to treat music.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Neal Morse, and I've really liked Steve Morse's playing for some time. Some how this album is completely different from the material that those two have put out over the years, but still has their essence still in tact. This music is concise, lyrically wonderful, and tastefully performed. The vocals are really what sets this apart. The modern sound of Casey's vocals over a bed of proggy flourishes just really works.<br /><br />There are a few songs that I feel are not nearly as good as the majority. \\"All Falls Down\\" and \\"Shoulda Could Woulda\\" are heavier songs that feel a bit out of place, and aren't nearly as interesting as the rest of the disc.<br /><br />Then there is \\"Fool in My Heart\\". This song could have been a nice slow rocker but it suffers from a lack of what I said earlier sets this album apart. Casey. The drummer does the lead vocals for this song. While not terrible, he is no Casey and I really would have liked to hear Casey on lead here. Now, I love Neal Morse to death, but his vocals in this song are just really cheesy. He reminds me of Weird Al.<br /><br />All that said, I still give this album five stars. Everything else makes up for those few short-comings.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen both the original version and this version plus I read all the books and I have to say how happy I was with the way they told the story! True things were changed but it was still heart pounding and intense! In theaters I took my hubby and a few friends who have never read read the book or seen the other version and their thoughts: Amazing, heart wrenching, captivating, and 'I really want to kill that F*'! Coming from two views: From a person who knows the original story line & from friends who knew nothing this movie is absolutely amazing!Also the blu-ray combo is just what I wanted with the ability to see everything in perfect quality! BUT please be aware of the subject matter for things get graphic.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Let me start by saying the story was typical King. Kept you reading, interesting and a good story. However I gave it 3 stars because I was a little disappointed by the length. Just as I was really getting into the story it ended. I think the preview of another book being released that is almost as long as this story.<br />As I said good story, but be prepared for it to be over quickly.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|If you ever explore threads asking people to list the movies they find the most boring, you'll see that There Will Be Blood is often mentioned. I can understand why. The opening 14-and-a-half minutes doesn't contain any dialogue unless you count the occasional grunt or cry of pain. The score is often unsettling and unlike anything you would expect to hear. The pacing is slow and the film has plenty of painful scenes.<br /><br />The opening scene is set in 1898 and gives us immediate insight into the character of Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis). We see him working alone, prospecting for oil. It's a physically demanding occupation which is full of danger. One small lapse can cause a severe injury or even death. Plainview falls down a well shaft and breaks his leg, but discovers oil in the process. We then see him crawl backwards as he slowly makes his way into town to register the find. He's one of the most stubborn and driven characters you will ever see portrayed on film.<br /><br />In 1902, he's working with a group of men, and we are reminded again how dangerous the work is. A tiny mistake results in the death of a man and Plainview adopts his orphaned baby boy.<br /><br />The story jumps forward several years and we see Plainview and his adopted son, HW, attending a town meeting. Plainview has discovered that the region contains oil and we see him making an offer to extract the oil. His argument is calm, reasonable, and logical. He's quite a salesman. He talks of other offers the town may receive and why his own proposal is the best solution for everyone. We are given the impression that he knows what he's talking about and it's difficult to resist his offer.<br /><br />When Plainview is visited by Paul Sunday (Dano), the main part of the film begins. Paul offers to reveal the location of land rich in oil and he negotiates a price for the information. Plainview visits the town and finds that the information is accurate. He begins buying up all the available land.<br /><br />The film contains a power struggle between Plainview and Eli Sunday (also played by Dano). Eli becomes Plainview's enemy immediately by negotiating a higher price for his father's ranch than Plainview expected to pay. Eli is also the town's priest and he seeks power and recognition at every available opportunity. Plainview sees him as a fake and doesn't seem to have any religious beliefs of his own, but he's forced to bow to Eli's wishes on several occasions.<br /><br />I've barely touched on the plot, but I won't reveal any more. This is a sprawling story spanning several decades. It's one of the most intense character studies that I've ever seen. You'll see how Plainview relates to other people and his adopted son. He's a ruthless businessman and it's dangerous to cross him. In one scene, we hear his honest thoughts on society:<br /><br />\\"I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people.\\"<br /><br />That last sentence is spoken with irony, but Plainview makes it clear that he understands his own true character. As the story progresses, we see what obsession and hatred can do to a man when it's maintained over a long period of time.<br /><br />My knowledge of film isn't as deep as you would expect for someone of my age. It's a relatively new obsession in my life. However, I believe that Daniel Day-Lewis delivers the best acting performance I have ever seen. I didn't doubt for a moment that he was a bitter, obsessed, driven man, capable of doing anything to bring him closer to his goals. Day-Lewis is in every scene and the film wouldn't have had the same impact without his astonishing performance.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are also superb. Jonny Greenwood's unusual score is particularly effective. One of my favorite moments happens during a drilling accident when the percussion increases in tempo as the scene unfolds. The cinematography is breathtaking at times. There's an early scene in which Plainview and HW approach the crest of a hill and the distant landscape is revealed. It's one of several moments of extreme beauty in the film.<br /><br />If the film has a fault, I would say that the final 20 minutes don't quite match the quality of the rest of the story. This closing sequence still works, and contains a few memorable moments, but the first two hours are close to perfect.<br /><br />If you enjoy character studies that aren't afraid to take the time to tell a story, There Will Be Blood might be your kind of film. If you need action and an upbeat conclusion, then it's probably not for you.W approach the crest of a hill and the distant landscape is revealed.

0307477479|1.0|which is why I am hesitant to write here that Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad isn't a good book.<br /><br />Taken in terms of the craftiness of her prose, Egan is quite witty. The book opens in a superb and quirky scene. Not to ruin it for you, I'll just say that it's a perfect, angular entrance into a hyper-textual world of desperation and everyday suspense for the desperate people.<br /><br />But one of a long list of Generation-X mid-life novels, this theme of social relevance and timeliness starts to get a bit overt, the craft shows:<br /><br />\\"... the deep thrill of these old songs lay, for Bennie, in the rapturous surges of sixteen-year-old-ness they induced; Bennie and his high school gang... none of whom he'd seen in decades...\\" (18).<br /><br />It should be pretty obvious and most readers would probably thank Egan for telling them the meaning flat-out instead of using art to show and imply it. Some readers wouldn't. But the meaning aside, it is another book, like Jonathan Franzen's Freedom, that pits the punk ethics of Generation X against the necessities of middle-age and responsibility. The characters struggle with infantilism, never growing up and seeing their children mature beyond them.<br /><br />For all its merits, Egan's novel pure ploy. For instance, the \\"Africa\\" scene of the book is the ultimate. Egan uses it as an instance of entering pop-anthropology [1]:<br /><br />\\"'Son', Lou says, into Rolph's ear. 'Let's take a walk.'<br /><br />The boy rises fromt he dust and walks with his father away from the fire. Twelve tents, each sleeping two safari guests, make a circle around it, along with three outhouses and a shower stall\\" (47)<br /><br />You may guess what this safari is leading to. Read then on page 48, the next page:<br /><br />\\"'Anthropology books,' she tells Cora. 'I'm in the Ph.D. program at Berkeley'\\" which leads to a list of names: \\"She isn't sure why she hasn't cracked her Boas or Malinowski or Julian Jaynes, but assumes she must be learning in other ways whtat will prove equally fruitful\\" (48).<br /><br />We kind of saw this coming all along. A means of putting a social-text inside a social-text, it is a tad too convenient to work without being just plain hacky. Move ahead further and read:<br /><br />\\"Mindy has even wondered  if her insights on the link between social structure and emotional response could amount to more than a rehash of Levi-Strauss\\" (48-49). Do we need to be hit with this so hard and in the face? And then Egan moves ahead listing<br /><br />\\"Structural Incompatiability: A powerful twice-divorced male will be unable to acknowledge, much less sanction, the ambitions of a much younger female mate\\" etc. (49).<br /><br />You get the point. The convenience of an \\"African Safari\\" and an anthropology major at a hip west coast Uni. is laying it on a bit heavy.<br /><br />In themidst of all this Egan throws so much front-story at us, telling us everything about their lives until we no longer care to follow them to implausible parties for bands like \\"The Flaming Dildos.\\" And do we care to slug through a bad joke: 80+ pages of a powerpoint shuffled into the narrative. These gimmicks are what they are: gimmicks.<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />[1] As soon as Africa was mentioned, before reading the actual references to Anthropology, I knew what I was in store for. You'd expect a Pulitzer winning novel to be a bit above this. In fact, Egan went even further, actually citing names and using specialist pseudo-lingo, ironically to be sure. But the irony fails and ends up as a total convention, a cliche really. I even wrote in the margin \\"Voila!\\" because it was just as I expected, hence boring and unfunny.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />*I'm trying to help and not be a cheerleader.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|From a Christian perspective, this movie had me once again second-guessing what I would do in Katniss' position. Would I resort to killing to stay alive, and bless my district? It was hard to think about. So, I simply sat back and watched. Katniss and Peeta do most of that sort of thinking for you, but it makes you wonder about your own convictions if put into such a situation.<br /><br />The filming was excellent, for the most part. Near the beginning, and a few times later on, the camera shook so much that it nauseated me, and I couldn't tell for the life of me what was happening. The broad contrast in colors from District 12 to the Capitol was really cool, and that leads me to my next observation.<br /><br />The Capitol really showed off its pomp and reliance on style. There were so many crazy and absurd ways of showing off their \\"beauty\\" that it made me sick. It starts just by wanting to get noticed. Reminds one of hollywood, eh? *chuckle*<br /><br />The gore was not very prevalent, which is good. In some cases, though (such as the death near the end), the violence is implied very intensely. That really bothered me, but it's a story to make you bothered at The Capitol. It did it's job well.<br /><br />Peeta and Katniss' characters were done well. Peeta didn't seem to show much depth, however, while Katniss did. Her reaction to her sister was chosen as tribute was heartbreaking. Judging from her excellent work in X-Men: First Class, she will go very far.<br /><br />In respect to the novel of the same name, it did very well! The slight few things that differed, improved the film. Seeing the book on the silver screen worked wonders, no matter if we knew the story already or not.<br /><br />The length of the movie, nearly 2.5 hours, was actually quite necessary. The preparation for the games required lots of attention, as did the games themselves, obviously. The time spent in each area was well-determined.<br /><br />I am pretty glad they didn't make this movie 3D. While it may have made it neat at times, there just wasn't enough reason to justify it.While it may have made it neat at times, there just wasn't enough reason to justify it.
145162445X|5.0|As a biologist, I am fascinated by physics, even though I don't understand the subject as well as I would like.  Dr. Krauss does an excellent job of explaining the evidence in a way that can be easily understood by anyone with a basic science background.  It is certainly difficult to wrap one's brain around the concept of \\"something\\" springing up from \\"nothing,\\" but Krauss really teaches the reader how to understand and evaluate the data with which we have been presented regarding the universe and its contents.  This primes the reader's brain to understand the bigger question of how the Big Bang could have come about in the first place.<br /><br />In addition, Krauss is open regarding the questions that still remain and the inadequacies of some current theories.  Hopefully, the reader understands that all scientific statements are malleable pending the acquisition of new data.  However, this does not mean that we should discard all current theories simply because they may be, one day, proven incorrect.  Scientific progress depends upon an understanding of current precepts as well as the current limitations and shortcomings.  Only then can these theories be modified and progress be made in understanding the true nature of the universe.<br /><br />As I have said, the study of physics fascinates me and I am constantly seeking to understand it better.  This book, more than any other, has helped me understand the Big Bang Theory and the prospective end of the universe... the beginning and the end.
1589946901|5.0|I have been an avid fan of the miniature game, Blood Bowl, for many years. When I first heard about the card game, I was apprehensive. The game's designer, Jay Little, also handled the revamp of the Warhammer RPG, and is a huge fan of the Warhammer universe, so it couldn't have been in better hands.<br /><br />The card game focuses on the team management aspect of the game, as opposed to the miniature games' focus on the football games themselves. Each player acts as the GM for a specific team from the Warhammer universe. Dwarfs, stolid if somewhat slow, best known for grinding down the pitch. Humans, good all around, able to throw, run, and crush opponents. Wood Elves, best known for throwing and avoiding being crushed. The forces of Chaos, seeking to beat down opponents and are not above cheating for a win. Orcs, brutes who bring a Troll and goblins to the field. The final team available is the Skaven, hideous ratmen with a touch of speed and a hidden dagger or two.<br /><br />Once players have their teams, the football games are touched on, with players going over a number of \\"highlght reels.\\" This provides a great sense of the football season, but keeps the game moving quickly.<br /><br />The game is fairly fast paced, and can be played in about 45 minutes, once you have the rules down. That being said, the rules aren't too difficult, and there isn't a high learning curve. For experienced players, multiple seasons could be completed in a night, making for a great story arc for the teams. Overall, a very solid game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've used other Bible app's but youversion is by far the best available. Features such as notes and the Bible reading plan are far better than what can be found on similar applications. As for finding a Bible version you are comfortable reading, you have the widest slection around with youversion.
0760335540|5.0|This is an excellent book. As a Porsche owner we know we can spend as much money on our cars as we can afford. The IMS information was really good. I wish I would have know about that problem before I bought my 2002 Boxster S. It gives a good comparison between the Pelican Kit and the LN kit.<br />Pelican is about $625, and the LN kit is about $1200. My repair shop uses the LN kit because they give a 18,000 warranty on parts and service.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Every once in a while, I read a book that actually transports me in time!  \\"The Kitchen House\\" was one of those books.  I am an African American woman, whose maternal great-grandmother was from Ireland.  This is something we as a family never quite understood, although we knew it to be true.  This novel, although a fictional account, showed how this could have transpired. This narrative shined light on how my white-skinned, red-haired, green-eyed great-grandmother could have been the product of indentured servitude; as it was definitely during this time period.  What a wonderful story!
0307346617|5.0|If a zombie apocalypse would happen in modern life, World War Z would be a good survival guide.<br /><br />In many successful occasion of causing great suspense through out the narrative, the book World War Z tells a magnificent story about how the world faces a zombie apocalypse. The entire world was on a mission on facing zombie issue that was causing great chaos to many people.<br /><br />As many other major books try to make a very suspenseful, scary tale about a zombie apocalypse, World War Z's suspense can be seen through out the struggle that they faced during the Zombie War.<br /><br />In one of the suspenseful part in this book, one young man had to escape a mob of zombies chasing after him, right after he tripped an created a big open gap on his ankle it made it 100 times harder to flee from all of them. His attempt to break free he found a car and hid there but it wasn't all over yet.<br /><br />The young man learned over the time that he was very lucky to have avoided that mob of zombies. Many people weren't that lucky, many were eaten alive by those mobs after mobs of zombies.<br /><br />Ouch!<br /><br />While World War Z has a very low amount of usage towards Figurative language but that small amount is good enough to give the story a great balance to give away a great sense of descriptive imagery.<br /><br />Such as Kwang Jing shu a medical doctor who shared his story about a young boy who was patient zero in China \\"He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his gowls.\\" It shows a great image in your head of how this poor 14-year-old kid had to go through because of the infection.<br /><br />Also it gives a new taste of the undead in many new ways, by not focusing on the characters like many other Zombies related books have done so. The narrative focuses more on smaller versions of storytelling by doing a documentary format with numerous interviews throughout.<br /><br />In The Amazon Rain Forest, Brazil doctors such as Doctor Silva was facing great terror because they had to deal with the infected more than everyone else. They brought him a patient not related to the infection but with a need of a new heart. Doctor Silva later finds out that this patient was not that alive, the operation was successful but during the recovery he turned into a zombie and ate Doctor Silva.<br /><br />We have never seen where a zombie tale talks so deeply about how the United States and many other States have such a corrupted system when it comes to this worldwide chaos. It doesn't only show the chaos that a zombie apocalypse will bring to the modern day but how the worlds system is so corrupted when it comes to these horrific events.<br /><br />World War Z is by far a very addicting book, to the zombie fanatics and many other book lovers.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|I totally loved this film. It's been in my permanent collection for many years.  Along with \\"Basquiat\\", \\"Pollock\\", \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\" (Vermeer), \\"Goya's Ghost\\", \\"Carrington\\", \\"Camille Claudel\\" (Claudel and Rodin), \\"Lust for Life\\" (Van Gogh and Gauguin), \\"The Agony And The Ecstasy\\" (Michelangelo), \\"Georgia O'keeffe\\", \\"Superstar\\" (Warhol) and \\"Crumb\\". These films may not be historically accurate but they all are artistically done, Oscar caliber and catnip for the serious fine arts lover.
0321784421|5.0|I bought Introducing HTML5 to get me up to speed with key aspects of HTML5 having been hands-off for a short while.  I expected the normal informative but largely dry texts and examples.  But no!  Bruce and Remy add a much needed injection of humour to spice up the examples, comments, tips and hints.  You get all the core HTML5 stuff you would expect on markup, browser compliance, advanced features like canvass, but in a format that is so much more enjoyable.  As it is enjoyable, it is an easy read, you tend to want to read that next chapter, and in my experience this makes for the best learning.  Don't get me wrong, these guys are not laughing at the standard or making light of a serious topic; it contains all the core information and facts you would need, plenty of solid examples and great code walk-throughs.  It offers advice as well as information, personal insights and opinions and it is clear to point out what is fact and what is opinion.  It just breaks it up with some more light hearted comments that makes the tone of the book much more conversational and less like reading a manual.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it for any experienced developer or designer that needs to get up to speed with the latest standard.<br /><br />Keep up the great work Bruce & Remy!

0812550706|5.0|Plot:<br /><br />It is the future. Earth has survived an attack from an insectile alien race - barely. Population control laws are in effect. Families are limited to 2 children. Young children are monitored to see if they have military potential, and those that show promise at an early age are whisked away to train in the military's Battle School, in the hopes that by the time they reach adulthood, they will possess the necessary skills to defend the Earth, if the aliens - \\"buggers\\" - ever return.<br /><br />Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is a rare third child in his family. His older brother and sister showed intellectual promise, but his brother was too ruthless and his sister too compassionate to qualify for Battle School. So the Wiggin parents were permitted a third chance to produce a military prodigy. And they succeeded.<br /><br />Ender is whisked away to Battle School at the ripe old age of 6. The School, located on a space station orbiting the Earth, is populated by military officers and child prodigies. Ender is one of the youngest.<br /><br />And these are not your average children.<br /><br />They train daily in space military tactics, weaponry, and combat. Although they are all at an age that we associate with Dora, Spongebob, and Hannah Montana, these kids are nothing like the children currently roaming your local elementary school hallway. They are calculating, intuitive, sometimes ruthless, always dangerous.<br /><br />One of the main focuses of the School is the battleroom, where the children are equipped with special suits and laser guns that allow them to fight each other in zero-gravity. On Ender's first trip to the battleroom, it becomes quickly apparent that he is a cut above the other students. Some of his peers respect this. Some are threatened by it.<br /><br />And as Ender works his way up through the ranks of Battle School, his teachers take notice, and wonder if perhaps Ender is the child they've been waiting for. The child who can change everything. The child who can save Earth.<br /><br />Why I Love It:<br /><br />Don't let the summary throw you off. Ender's Game may be a book about children, but it is by no means a book for children. The children in this book are nothing like how we picture children (as the mother of an almost-6-year-old, I can say this pretty definitively). Everything about this book is aimed at an adult audience.<br /><br />Ender's Game is not a thriller or adventure story, although some of the battleroom scenes are exciting. More than anything, it's an examination of the mind of Ender Wiggin, the culture he lives in, and a world under military rule. And it's all fascinating.<br /><br />Mr. Card writes Ender in a way that while you understand he is just a child, you can still be awed, chilled, and amazed at his thoughts and actions. As a matter of fact, all of the characters are interesting and intriguing, from his friends at the Battle School, to his sociopath brother Peter, to the Commander of the Battle School, Colonel Graff.<br /><br />There is a twist at the end of Ender's Game. You may see it coming; you may not. I did, but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book one bit. The fact that I have read this book over and over again, in spite of knowing the twist ending, speaks to the strong writing of the rest of the book. The book doesn't exist just to throw you off at the end. The book exists to make you think, to draw you completely into the character of Ender, and to absorb you in the science-fiction world he lives in.ng.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I normally don't think much of hype when it comes to popular media, but I have to admit that this is a pretty dang good series thus far.  I'm writing this review prior to reading the third book.<br /><br />After finishing the first book, I was loathe to continue because I didn't have that much concern over the characters' fates.  But once I started reading the second book, I couldn't put it down.  The plot has me intrigued even though it has been done before.  And the characters have developed even more to the point where I actually want to see what happens in book three.<br /><br />The present tense writing style is a little awkward, but it's not hard to get past that.  My biggest complaint is simply the fact that I feel as if this book loses a little bit simply due to the fact that it was written to a younger target audience.  I don't find the experiences of the main characters to be as brutal as they could be.  Or perhaps, I should say that the writing style for younger audiences depicts those experiences as being less brutal than they really are.  If this series was written for an adult audience, and the experiences of the characters could be written in a more concise and provocative manner, this story has the potential to be absolutely riveting.<br /><br />That is what it all comes down to.  This is a good read, but it fails to live up to expectations.  Furthermore, there is really no literary epiphones involved.  This is pure popcorn, plain and simple, but it's good popcorn.

B003Y5H5HY|1.0|The Swedish original is much more intense (and also streams free with Amazon Prime). If you have not seen this movie before, I suggest you watch the original version.
B00280LYIM|4.0|I think I would hate to be a demi-god, I mean not really, but every summer these kids are facing some major battles, and Percy is dreading a prophecy that's supposed to take place when he's 16, which is right around the corner. That's just a lot for these kids to take on, but they do it and they do it with gusto.<br /><br />I really enjoy Riordan's writing style, it's engaging and not overly complicated but not dumbed down either it's great for all ages to enjoy. Percy is a fairly likeable character, he's a lot like any other freshmen boy but with a few more burdens to carry. This story takes place not long after \\"The Titan's Curse\\" ended. Honestly, I didn't know if I would get back into this series, because the beginning did start off the same as the previous 3 novels, Percy Jackson trying to fit into regular school life and things going horribly wrong. After all of that happened though the story picks up, we just had to get Percy back into the swing of things and back with his gang out on another quest. I liked how the labyrinth was created, the labyrinth is a character in itself, and that Annabeth finally gets her quest, but she's keeping a secret. The growth of the characters is slow but steady with some jumps in between. They're kids that had to grow up quickly because their parents were too lazy to take care of Kronos themselves.<br /><br />What get me is why Kronos wants to kill the inhabitants of camp half blood so badly, I mean I get they're trained to fight monsters and what not, but doesn't going straight to Olympus make more sense? Oh well, I'm not some tyrannical ancient Titan who was chopped up by his kids and buried, unkillable in Tartarus, who's probably been brooding for a few millenia. It's a good read and this journey is coming to a close with a promise of a fantastic, `final' journey.
0425241505|2.0|If comparing this book to other Romance authors - Sophie Kinsella, Gena Showalter, Laura Kinsale, Jayne Ann Krentz & Nalini Singh - this book is tidbits of other stories. It felt like a True Blood storyline (Charlene Harris novels), but takes place in New York, rather than Louisiana. I didnt like the modern language of Drago, no need to cuss really. The heavy sex scenes are reminiscent Gena Showalter & Sherrilyn Kenyon's<br /><br />I stopped readn up to Ch 13, couldnt feel for the main characters Pia & Drago, or the environment that wasnt mysterious or magical in any way. i dont care how it ends. Story wasnt captivating enough.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love Doctor Who, and 10's sonic screwdriver was a necessary add on to my collection of Doctor Who things. I don't know how it would rate as a toy for a child, but for an adult Doctor Who fan, it is wonderful. It is a bit hard to put the batteries in, but I figured it out and didn't break anything. I take it with me everywhere and I get questions and comments when I use it to take notes. Yes, it's also a pen! And it has two attachments, one that is plain black ink, and another that is fun invisible UV ink! And when you shine the sonic's light on what you've written in invisible ink, it lights up! I love it, and I would recommend it to any fan. Allons-y!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|I have several editions of this film and love the Blueray version as well. Great transfer of a great film. Peter Weir and Cast( a superb Russell Crowe and Paul B) deliver pathos, humor, amazing action, and authenticity of life at sea. A film deep in details that captures rich characterization , enjoyable for all lovers of adventure and wondrous film making. I only wish all of Weir's films get treated with such care.

This film slows to an abrubt end . It leaves u soo perplexed & angry at life in general it's almost unbearable.The acting & direction being perfect for this document of surellism that is very real indeed. A MORE IMPORTANT FILM HAS NEVER BEEN MADE.

6305311463|3.0|Both the original release on DVD and this Criterion edition, though having great features, aren't enhanced for hd tv's and the picture quality is so low and boxed in that you might as well get the Blueray. Recent viewings of past dvd transfers definitely shows flaws, look for digital transfer technology and not all packages are the same. Loved the film, a fun action flick with lots of silliness and fun effects typical of Micheal Bay.
B00756GKBA|4.0|On her latest album, Madonna takes us back to the nightclub much as she did on \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\".  With production by Martin Solveig, William Orbit, and Benny Benassi, \\"MDNA\\" comprises catchy upbeat numbers.<br /><br />Opening (after a brief prayer/confession a la \\"Like A Prayer\\")  is the propulsive \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" with faint whiffs of her song \\"Celebration\\". No surprise there seeing as both were produced by Benassi. \\"Girls they just wanna have some fun\\" she sings, and the song is fun, as is much of the album.<br /><br />The spoken/sung \\"Gang Bang\\" is dark with a deep monotonous bassline and a Dubstep break with Madonna chanting \\"Die bitch\\" at the end. It is sure to be a favourite. \\"I'm Addicted\\" is a swirly glitchy affair with a chant of \\"MDNA\\" at the end.<br /><br />Other standouts are the clubby \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Love Spent\\" (with some nice strumming guitar or banjo, very \\"Ray Of Light\\"), and the pair of ballads, the absolutely gorgeous \\"Masterpiece\\" (which finds her comparing her lover to a work of art), and the string-swathed \\"Falling Free\\" which is laced with electronic flourishes, reminiscent of \\"Mer Girl\\". Both ballads feature her most heartfelt vocals on the album.<br /><br />Among the bonus cuts, standouts are The &uuml;ber catchy \\"Beautiful Killer\\", and \\"Best Friend\\", the latter with rather clever clipped beats.<br /><br />I must confess, there isn't much lyrical depth (though \\"Love Spent\\" features some clever word play), some songs could even be considered trite (\\"I'm A Sinner\\", for example), and the collaborators (MIA and Nicki Minaj) are largely redundant,  but it largely works and benefits from repeated play. Unlikely to win her any new fans, but should please most of her old.
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|Like most people, I already knew about the story before having watched this version of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I had watched the Swedish version and was looking forward to the American one to compare, especially after having heard all of the rave reviews for it.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />There are two reasons why I am disappointed:  Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.  Daniel Craig's version has none of the conscience or heart of Nyqvist's version, which I had thought made him a perfect character in a story where those feelings are few and far between.  I liked the idea that Blomkvist had a sense of empathy, which made him a great foil to Salander who is all calculating vengeance.<br /><br />Next to deadpan Craig is deadpan Mara, who seems to have a \\"been-there-done-that\\" attitude to everything that happens to or around her.  She's almost boring to look at, no matter how shocking the scene is.  There's no inner fragility and no sense that she is having to endure a lot like Rapace's version does.  I found myself losing interest by the end of the American version, mostly because there seemed little interest in Craig's and Mara's expressions.  If they didn't care what they were doing, why should I?<br /><br />But kudos to the supporting actors and actresses, especially Joely Richardson and Christopher Plummer.  And the dreary, cold setting for the movie was well done; it lent a foreboding atmosphere to the tragic story.<br /><br />Sorry to all the fans of the movie, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy this version of the Dragon Tattoo.

B007704HO6|5.0|You know what they say .... sometimes angels don't have wings.  Bob was truly an angel who saved James from certain self-destruction.  And it's clear very early on that James saved Bob's life as well.  It's a very good read, quite heartwarming and brought a few tears (the happy kind).  James displayed that Bob means the world to him over and over.  They truly did save each other.  I highly recommend this book and hope that James and Bob have a long, healthy, prosperous life together.  Also proves another true sentiment:  Real Men Love Cats!<br /><br />Would be wonderful in the not-so-distant future to read a sequel so we can all continue the journey with Bob and James and find out how they're doing since the book release.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|So my first rock album was Thick as a Brick at age 9 or so. I bought it due to its cool packaging. I made my way backwards through the<br />Golden Tull years ( although I do like Songs..., War Child etc). Aqualung was a frequent visitor to my turntable.<br /><br />I have purchased remastered editions of classics in the past. Sometimes it makes a difference other times not so much. This one sounds<br />like a different album. It is as if they took a layer of cotton wadding off the intial recording. Holy Shite this is an aural assault in<br />a good way. The drums are just pummelling - the kicks are gut wrenching and the snares/cymbals have you on edge. The separation of instrumentation<br />is such that you hear EVERYTHING. Ian's voice is super clear - very little effects on anything - clean and spring fresh! Previously buried parts now come forward. Does the mix sound a bit less blended? well yeah - but that might be my brain trying to process something that isnt new in a new way.  All the songs are forward - in your face - there is a welcome rawness and intensity that comes through in spades. Its loud - even at low volumes if that makes any sense. There is a brightening that pushed any farther might be too much but I think they nailed it. Honestly - this should be a no brainer purchase for even the most tepid Tull fans. Pleae enjoy and remember \\"He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sunday\\"....

B0060AY6FO|4.0|For lovers of Jane Austen and mysteries, this is delightful reading. James's ability to recreate Austen's vast range of characters is uncanny, as if Austen herself had magically been resurrected so that her beloved Elizabeth and Darcy could once again exchange their wit and wisdom on the sometimes turbulent chaos that threatens the sanctity of their cherised way of life.  The denouement is a bit tedious as previous events are analyzed and placed into persepective with exacting detail. Notwithstanding, I still rate James's book as a 4 star read.

1439153663|4.0|I thought this book was amazing, heartbreaking at times, but worth the read to me. Some have complained that too many horrible and sad things happen in the book, but we're talking about slavery, a drunkard/abusive husband and slave owner, orphans, rape, inbreeding - this is stuff that actually happened during times of slavery, and to ask that the author sugarcoat all of that or tone it down is ridiculous. At least a lot of the gritty details of some of the worst things that happened were spared. This book captivated me and made me that much more grateful to be free and to have been born in a time when slavery has been abolished (not that it doesn't still exist in places). I also didn't mind the writing style of having the two narrators, Belle and Lavinia, summarize some of the events. To me it felt just like they were relaying their personal story to me, just like a real live person would if they were sitting right in front of you. My only criticism and the reason for only 4 stars is that the ending (specifically the last chapter)felt very abrupt. I would have liked a little bit more detail about what happened to the main characters who lived. Unless, of course, there is to be a sequel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is pretty good, especially for free. I wish it would automatically tell me when there were no moves left.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story, great premise, but the overall storytelling left much to be wanted. I really enjoyed The Hunger Games and should have the series wrapped up in a few days because the story is that interesting. However, when I read Suzanne Collins writing I can't help but wonder if she is actually a 12 year old girl, because that is how these books read. Like I said before I really enjoyed the story of The Hunger Games and like Katniss as a character, but the  way Collins uses the first person perspective drives me crazy and reminds me of a sixth grade creative writing class. Would recommend it, but I would like to see what a more skilled writer could have done with the same story and premise.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Blondie \\"Eat To The Beat\\"  #17  (1979).<br /><br />Blondie's 4th album \\"Eat To The Beat\\", is a great follow up to \\"Parallel Lines\\" (1978).  This album produced 3 hot 100 hits in, \\"Dreaming\\", #27 a disgrace, should of hit top 10!, Clem Burke's drumming here is just whack-o.  \\"The Hardest Part\\", #84 with  it's choppy sound, a very strong tune.  \\"Atomic\\" #39, is a disco tune that should of been a bigger hit, excellent track.  \\"Union City Blue\\", is favorite of mine, a tune about Union City, New Jersey, love Debbie's voice here.  \\"Shayla\\", nice pop rocker with great bass and drums.  The title track is a pulverizing rocker.  Jimmy Destri's \\"Accidents Never Happen\\", continues the party, a very good track.  \\"Die Young Stay Pretty\\", with it's reggae beat, just genius.  The echoish \\"Slow Motion\\", the lounging feel of \\"Sound-A-Sleep\\".  \\"Victor\\", Debbie screams with the best of 'em  on this track and the album closes with \\"Living In The Real World, a nice slice of punkie  energy.  1980 gave us the album \\"Autoamerican\\", which started the slide.
B000022TSW|5.0|One problem with making movies out of TV shows, particularly animated shows, is making a clear seperation between the two mediums, and South Park did just that. This story is an epic tale of our favorite young crew but it still has the down-to-earth messages the series provides. It's pretty obvious by this movie that Matt and Trey enjoy musicals and this movie is one of the few that is not only enthralling but hilarious as well. I would recommend this movie to any fan of South Park.

B006MGC3VK|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the music created by OSI. This CD is no exception.  Keep listening !!!  These guys are great !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005MNP8|5.0|Blondie  \\"Parallel Lines\\" (1978)  #6.<br /><br />After two excellent albums, Blondie hit the motherlode with \\"Parallel Lines\\".  This album brought all of Blondie's musical formats together.  They called in british producer Mike Chapman, who had earlier success with Sweet and Suzi Quatro in the early to mid 70's.  The songwriting on this disc was getting a lot better too.  Here's the review of the album, we get the hard charging' cruncher \\"Hanging On The Telephone\\", a cover tune earlier done by The Nerves.  The #24 hot 100 hit \\"One Way Or Another\\", a slice of new wave power rock.  The seductive \\"Picture This\\". I would of never thought Robert Fripp of King Crimson, would appear on a Blondie album, but he does on \\"Fade Away And Radiate\\", good stuff.  \\"Pretty Baby\\", has a 60's girl group feel to it.  \\"I Know But I Don't Know\\".  a pinky little number, Clem Burke keeps it moving along.  Jimmy Destri's \\"11:59\\", is a classic.  Another Jack Lee number in the guitar rave-up \\"Will Anything Happen?\\".  \\"Sunday Girl\\", is a sweet popper that fits Debbie Harry perfectly.  The #1 hit \\"Heart Of Glass\\", with it's disco-rock rhythms, good music, never got any better.  \\"Gonna Love You Too\\", is a 2:00 smoker, and the album closes with the Debbie Harry pop rocker \\"Just Go Away\\".  Blondie never topped this album, but they came close with their next release in 1979 \\"Eat To The Beat\\".
145162445X|5.0|Reading this book was a treat. Beforehand, I had only some layman's exposure to theories of cosmology that generally alluded to the nature of very prominent discoveries and reformulations by the \\"big shots\\" of physics throughout the years, and often times these contained dated material and discussed problems that have since been resolved by experiment (Like which of Alexander Friedman's solutions of Einstein's equations was relevant to our universe, for example). What's fantastic about this book is that it contains very recent material expounded by a physicist who is currently working on and contributing to these problems at the very forefront of cosmology. Clear as it has become that Dr. Krauss is himself an atheist and proponent of secular ideals, (concepts which I--for full disclosure--am very much in agreement with) it does not at all present a salient concern for the material discussed in this book. The most common criticisms of the book seem to be its failure to address the pure, philosophical nothing. This view was most recently advanced in the NY Times review by the philosopher of science, David Albert, who accused Krauss of trying to paint a picture of relativistic quantum field vacuum states as \\"not being physical stuff at all\\", which is something that I, personally, did not take away from Krauss' picture of quantum effects in current theories of cosmology. What it seems apparent that Krauss is doing, and what his critics fail to realize, is that Krauss is simply following the science where it leads; a concept which would also address Albert's repeating the phrase \\"Period. Case closed. End of story.\\" to patronize Krauss' for what he feels is and absolutist interpretation of contemporary cosmology. It would be a much less readable book if Krauss ended each sentence with \\"but, by the purest standards of epistemology, I can't say this for certain, and perhaps somewhere down the line we will be proven wrong and have to go back to the drawing board\\". Krauss does make note to mention that future experiments may prove some of his interpretations wrong (which should be taken as a truism). What he's doing with \\"nothing\\" is trying to find what this means in terms of our world. We don't have much experience observing our own universe begin, and given the severe difficulties in regards to quantum measurements, we still have much to learn about the arrangement of relativistic quantum mechanical fields. The pure, idealized, philosophical nothing may have nothing to do with a necessary state of the physical world, and Krauss is only concerned with the definitions of nothing that Physics can provide and he is only discussing potential candidates of such that we have empirically-supported reason to postulate upon. He does well to note that the contentions he advanced which would be necessitated by quantum gravity are by no means certain, as this is very far from a verified or complete theory. Ultimately Krauss recognizes that he is not addressing the philosophical nothing, because he is trying to find the nothing that actually corresponds to this world. So many of his critics seem to take the idealized nothing as a necessary precursor to all physical phenomenon, but this has not yet been observed or verified, which is what Physics tries its very best to do when explaining phenomena in the world.<br /><br />The nit-picky criticisms of David Albert, William Lane Craig, and others is really missing the point of this very accessible, layman's guide to contemporary cosmology. It contains great explanations of how we know the big bang occurred, how we know the age of our universe, how we know the universe is flat and why this is the most desired universe, how we know gravitational energy is cancelled out, how we know the universe is expanding, and most amazingly, how we now have reason to believe that quantum vacuum fluctuations contributed to the spontaneous density fluctuations that may have caused matter to collapse and form galactic clusters and galaxies and solar systems, where microscopic pockets of life may forever ride across the quickening expansion of the universe, bound together and saved from the void by local gravitational systems, and, if you're lucky enough, humanistic happiness.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an Excellent value! Having the option to purchase the entire trilogy saved time and money. Easy way to have an elevtronic copy of Books. Already had paperbacks and wanted to re-read before the movie.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|After finishing the first three books in the series, I was very eager to purchase the fourth but came here to read the reviews of it first.  I was quickly let down after seeing all the negative feedback - especially those who complained about some of the major characters (many of my favorites) not being mentioned in AFFC.  I became disheartened but still purchased the book and reluctantly started reading it to \\"get it over with\\" so I could move on to book 5.<br /><br />Well, I have been very pleasantly surprised.  I found this book very hard to put down some days.  I was just as engrossed in the new characters and places and was extremely interested in learning more about the \\"minor\\" characters Martin expanded on in this book.  Yes, I still wanted to know what was going on with my old favorites... but that made the read all the more pleasurable.  As I read AFFC, I was anxiously waiting to find out how the new character's stories would tie back in to where the stories left off in Book 3.  Now I find that I have MORE characters to love and places to fill my imagination with as the world of Westeros comes alive in Martin's books!
0439023513|4.0|I started reading the first book the night I saw the movie, and I haven't been able to put them down since. The story is very enthralling, but if you are one of those people (like half the people leaving reviews for this book on this site) who won't like it because it didn't have a happy ending or because Katniss spends much of the book in the throes of post-traumatic stress disorder instead of being constantly heroic and infallible, go read something else. The author's message from the book is very clear, and she has portrayed the hell that is war in a frighteningly accurate manner. Characters drop like flies. Katniss spends a good half the book in an obvious state of mental instability. The love triangle is resolved in a realistic way, if not satisfying to the readers who want a fairy-tale ending, and Katniss goes on to live the rest of her life battered, broken, and scarred, both physically and emotionally, yet still manages to find as much happiness as she can be expected to after everything she experienced. If you like your books only slightly dark, but with a satisfying happy ending like Harry Potter (my favorite series in the world by the way, so don't think I'm criticising it - it is just so fundamentally different from Hunger Games), then do not read this book, you'll just hate it. If you want an accurate portrayal of what would happen to people during and after such a brutal, bloody war, then I highly recommend Mockingjay.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was a fast read. Gave true insight to your<br />mate's priorities. Would recommend to every couple<br />to gain a much better understanding of your mate.<br />It works!
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Each character is unique in its expression. George Cloony is awesome in showing emotions and living the character.  It gets you thinking...
B0053O89WY|5.0|We came to watch Big Bang this past Christmas when our daughter was given Seasons 1 & 2 as a gift. . . we've since bought the 1st 4 seasons for ourselves and are in the process of re-watching them all for the 2nd time.  It always makes us laugh, makes a bad day better, and a good day great!  Eagerly looking forward to Season 5.
B007LB1O3I|2.0|I don't like it.  I like Madonna a lot, but I don't like this.  The lyrics, with the exception of Masterpiece from her movie W.E., are no stretch of the language, no new concept added to the cultural lexicon.  I expect more from her.  At 53, she should be saying something other than this, something substantial.  It's as if she ignored her ability to create meaningful and moving music and went for what's popular.  Now she sounds like all the other garbage out there.  Obviously, I don't buy much of what's popular nowadays.  It has nothing to offer.  It's recycled and overproduced music sung by underdressed girls trying to entice an audience.  It's product with a capital P, not art with a capital A.<br /><br />Madonna may have chosen the gotta-be-popular route early in her career but her talent stood out and she achieved great success through tireless innovation and creativity.  To resort to this \\"music\\" that consists of upbeat rhythms with forgettable lyrics shoved into it is sad.  I hope she takes a backwards step, looks within and comes up with another Ray of Light.  She has the talent and the opportunity to forge works of art.  She should not be singing cheerleader dance music for a young generation of consumers.<br /><br />Even the album title seems like it's missing something.  Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it's pretty symbolic: MDNA is NEFM (not enough for me).
145162445X|5.0|There is nothing more innately frightening to me than Nothing. The thought brings to mind Beckett's \\"End Game\\". Sarte's \\"Nausea\\". The scientist in me has always kept the fact that the universe is made of something as somehow a guard against the ultimate terror. In a way Krauss puts that into question. That should terrify me more. What it does however is put science to the thing that I love so much about Beckett. It makes me know that I am not alone in this beautiful nature, which came from nothing, and may return to it, and that it will do so with and without me...
0525423656|5.0|This book was really slow paced, but it fit the story well. I just wish it hadn't been so slow paced so I would've finished it faster. I fell in love with the whole new cast of characters, and I fell into a whole new kind of love with the old characters. All their relationships with one another were complex and realistic.<br />The setting was stunning. I could picture everything so clearly in my mind. Every detail added another brush stroke to the picture I was painting in my mind.<br />Of course the writing was perfect. Ally Condie is a writing genius. I cannot praise her enough. Her writing is so lovely that I can't get enough of it!
B003Y5H556|5.0|I really like this movie. The first time I saw it, a lot of the music caught my ear. I got the soundtrack and have listened to it countless times. (I absolutely love \\"Keep The Streets Empty For Me\\" by Fever Ray. That song is amazing.)<br /><br />I love the atmosphere of the movie. The small village has a very cozy, intimate feeling about it. I want to live there!  :)<br /><br />This movie won't appeal to everyone by any means. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't pretend to be some pretentious, hoity toity film for movie snobs. It is what it is, and that's what I like about it.<br /><br />So, regarding the movie. Personally I give it 5 stars because I like the atmosphere and I love the soundtrack.<br /><br />Regarding the disc, I hate it. I give it 0 stars simply for the fact that every time you put the disc in and hit play, you are forced to watch the same movie trailer. (Yes - you can skip it, but even so, a disc I purchase should not force me to watch movie trailers. Think about it. I still have DVD's from 10+ years ago. I assume I will still have this blu-ray 5 to 10 years from now. I don't want to watch the same stupid movie trailer for the next 10 years!)<br /><br />Even worse, blu-ray technology pretty much sucks. It's an utter failure in my opinion. (Streaming is the future.)<br /><br />The biggest gripe I have with this disc (and others like it) is that you can't resume! If you need to turn the movie off and go do something (or go to bed), when you hit play the following day, the disc starts over at the beginning. (And yes - it plays the movie trailer all over again.)<br /><br />I find this kind of thing completely infuriating. With all this advanced technology we have, you'd think that something as basic as remembering where I stopped the movie wouldn't be an issue. I'd be willing to bet the DVD doesn't have this kind of idiotic problem.
