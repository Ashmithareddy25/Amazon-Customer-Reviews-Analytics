B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Liam Neeson is always interesting in the off-center parts he plays.  This one has an interesting story and graphics that I find dark and progressive.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|When I saw Robert Downey Jr in the original Iron Man movie, I thought 'that's how you should do a comic book movie!'  But I've got to say, Iron Man has been upstaged, but fortunately it's by himself.<br /><br />What really made the movie?  There are so many great lines, many of them delivered by Robert Downey Jr, but all of the Avengers have their moments.<br /><br />If DC Comics ever gets around to doing their rumored Justice League movie set up, then they will have some big shoes to fill.<br /><br />The only downer of note was the dearth of extras on the DVD, compared to the Blu-Ray versions, but of the movie itself, no question is it worth it, even without those.
B000FILW86|4.0|This was on my son's wish list for his birthday.  I like to get these lists, it makes shopping easier, less underwear.
B00A77II0U|5.0|May be a little too creepy for kids. I enjoyed it.  Brain games were good.  Story was good and not too long.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This is a book about the possibilities inherent in a technocratic approach to apocalypse. The format is a series of interviews with various survivors of a global zombie event. This format, and the meticulous research behind it, gives the whole thing a realism that is quite gripping. The format also allows Brooks to highlight certain aspects (such as clearing the Parisian sewers) that give light to the whole. In addition, each survivor story is a compact mini-novella, with its own arc and suspense. This is the kind of book one can begin on a Saturday and not stop until it is finished by Sunday, and have an excellent weekend in the process.
B005HW21Y4|4.0|A bit different - Irish mythology for a refreshing change. Good story and some really interesting characters. Thankfully the author doesn't make them sound 'Oirish' but there are a couple of times when Widow MacDonagh gets perilously close! Sometimes she sounds Scottish!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's medium fun...just started it last night....between Jewels and Free Flow, I spent more than one mindless hour -- playing..  It's a problem solver type game and I enjoiy that.
B0038Q3UKA|5.0|Absolutely wonderful performances of great music.  I have absolutely no complaints.  And now I'll add a few more words to reach the minimum.
B005LAII08|5.0|Our 2 year old daughter loves this movie.  She runs around yelling for &#34;Merda&#34; (her version of Merida).  We like that Brave has strong women characters for our daughter to look up to.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I would reccomend this product to anyone who like to play games.  It is a nice passtime.  This is one game you can play by yourself and enjoy playing it.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This is a fabulous group and an impressive CD.  They remind me of Queen, brought up to date.  A couple tracks are not up to the overall excellence of the others, but are still good.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Cute movie, with a cute red head and storyline about her relationship with her mother. Very sweet movie, kids and adults like it.
0312641893|5.0|When my granddaughter requested this book and one other one for Christmas, I came to Amazon. I was pleased with the entire purchasing experience, and she seems happy with the book.
B003W77SA8|5.0|ELO produced a series of excellent CD/albums. This one had probably the most single song type hits. But it is the non hit songs you really miss by getting a greatest hit package. ELO non hits are also excellent and show an excellent range in their music. Jeff Lyne is an outstanding writer and producer.
1455519006|5.0|This was a gift for our son, and he is pleased. He's a big Baldacci fan. He requested the book, and it was a birthday gift.
B003W77SAS|4.0|This would not be the first CD I would by to start my ELO collection. I rate 4 others CD's slightly better. But this one is very good. This was done during the Xanadu Movie score Jeff wrote. I wish Xanadu the song was part of this CD (it should have been). He got a little grief from his band mates about giving to much attention to the Movie.
B0086700CM|3.0|this game is very slow and downy to the way I want it to it is very inkling becouse you get fustrated that is rodent do what you want to doooooooooo I wish that they would come out with anouther free temple run.
B008Z9L94O|4.0|Nice heavy weight vinyl,inserts and artwork truly amazing.I m not going to play it because I already have the music. It is a nice collectors Item.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game doesn't respond to if I jumping or if I'm turning to get coins. this is a good game but it has its ups and downs................<br />.............. p.s.<br />IT IS FREEEEEEEEE
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a very sweet romance. It has a lot of uh ohs and what ifs. I could not put it down.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love this top she has on.  I need to become a designer.  I would love to see her in my designs.  Just a dream for now.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the complete set from start to finish. I felt this set is the best of the Batman movies  that have been produced to date.
B00000G5WJ|5.0|I thought I would never hear this music again, but I wish I could get all of it and all of the seasons.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great set of Indiana Jones adventures. Enjoyed this very much from the first to the last. Recommend this to all Indiana fans.
B007R21JJK|5.0|Nice motherboard, great instructions, Awesome Bios menu.<br />No problems so far, Would definitely recommend this Motherboard to any Budget Oriented PC Builder.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I found this to be very entertaining, true to the Tintin stories and will look for the next adventure should there be one.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|An easy read with lots of great advice.  The &#34;tell a story&#34; format made the examples easy to remember long after the book was closed.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN.<br />VERY ROMANTIC BOOK.<br />I RECOMMENDED THAT MY MAN FRIEND TO READ<br />NOT SURE IF HE GOT AS MUCH OUT OF LIKE I DID
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|I've been a Regina fan for the better part of a decade and this album doesn't disappoint.  You never know where she is going to go vocally, but you can be sure that it will be unique and beautiful.<br /><br />There isn't a song on the album I don't love
B006MW3UZW|4.0|If you liked Season 1, you'll like Season 2. War comes to Downton Abbey.  Mrs. Padmore is sweet.  Who knew?
B006M9NJFG|3.0|Compare to G.I. type military canteen set, i prefer the military canteen set.<br /><br />This Gerber canteen has a good looking, worth the price, but the canteen cup is too small, i think probably it's about only 15 OZ,<br /><br />The canteen cup is pretty tied on the canteen and stick on the canteen all the time, it's a problem after a camping fire.<br /><br />Overall, it's a high quality product but it's not designed for using.
B006LSZECO|3.0|the book was amazing right up until the ending. The ending was horrible. I really hope there will be a second book.
0006513778|4.0|I love Agatha Christie I just thought my students would like it more. They probably will like one of her plays better.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|The movie was average length, reminded me of Alien but not fought in space but on a lifeless planet. The beginning was confusing however it was all wrapped up in the end so it all made sense to me. I enjoyed the move overall.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am using this series in collaboration with my curriculum. My seniors in high school cannot wait to watch it each week!
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This book has allowed me to be very creative with my bracelets. The instructions are very specific and helpful. Thanks for the good work.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Childs never disappoint when they release a book with Agent Pendergast and any or all of their supporting cast with AP. Have read every book by them, and highly recommend you do as well. You will be a follower of one of the best continuing characters ever! Read/enjoy.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I bought this game for my new Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; so my daughter could play the game.  She loves it, and it helps here dexterity.  She's a CP victim.  I'm teaching her how to use the Kindle.  She's teaching me how to play games.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This was an action packed and fun movie to watch! I will most likely watch this again in the future :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this game for my daughter when I got my new Kindle Fire HD 7.  She loves it.  We even got to Level 10 together.  For me that's progress!  (grin).
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Amazing value.........<br />Clarity, volume, depth, vocals, imaging.....EVERYTHING improved on my UE 350's.......can't wait to get my Velodyne VPulses in the mail!!!<br /><br />I could go on and on.....but bottom line: it can power earbuds, over ear headphones.....and it's itty bitty.....<br /><br />Fiio has me sold........getting the Fiio ANDES/E07K!<br /><br />Buy it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a ridiculously addictive game. I know it is not just me because I have been playing it in public and the first thing other people have said about it is that they have trouble putting it down.<br /><br />It works really smoothly on my KFire.<br /><br />I enjoy it and so does my 7 year old granddaughter. There aren't many games that are that flexible as to age.<br /><br />Besides being addictive, this game really exercises your brain. After working on it for a while, I don't feel like I have been just wasting my time or staring into space. I have actually been thinking and concentrating pretty hard, just for the fun of it.<br /><br />People who give away free things have to eat, too: There is advertising at the bottom when you are plugged into the internet, although it does not interfere with the game. There is occasionally advertising about other games that is annoying because you have to close a screen to keep on playing. AND: To get more hints, you have to buy them. Unfortunately for the Big Duck company, after I used us a pack of hints, I realized that I didn't really need them anyway, so they won't make much money off me for more hints.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|This is a hilarious movie! It's fun, charming, and intriguing! The music is wonderful as well! My personal favorite is I'll Make A Man Out of You!
B002AS466O|1.0|We bought this to replace an old VHS version. The quality of this DVD was horrible....not any better than the old VHS.  We've replaced numerous VHS movies with DVD's and on the other's the quality was great but on this one apparently the producer of this one decided to not bother to enchance the video....truly disappointed and not worth the money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it. I have read all of the books and this is my favorite one. I recommend that anyone  who hasn't read it to read it!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I think this book was a outstanding way to end the series. It was a nail bitter and was very funny. I liked how you could never tell what would happen next or the prophecy. I wish Rick did a better job of making it harder to find out who the spy was.
140132634X|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It makes you think about how we go through our lives. It made me more aware of time...
B002RSDW80|4.0|Wow!  This was a fast shipment and I can't wait to sit down and watch it. Thanks for good service!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down.  I highly recommend this book!  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Wow!  This was a fast shipment and I can't wait to sit down and watch it. Thanks for good service!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Great movie but the sound was so low I had to but my volume up to 100 and still strugged to hear. In the end I had to turn on CC.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Worst app ever who wants to sit around and look at random numbers I know I don't so dumb I wish I could give it no stars don't download this app
B005I6EU48|3.0|It is a nice looking case cover, however, it could fit a bit better.  It is supposed to be designed to fit the Kindle Fire but it will not close all the way (spine not wide enough).  Perhaps an rubberized strap to hold the front cover and back cover together.  It was a gift to a friend an they are happy with it, so I guess that is all that counts but I was a bit disappointed.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this set for my grandaughter. She loves the set.they were in excellant condition.She has already started reading them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Picked this book while looking for a fresh sci-fi book and could not be happier!  You care about the characters and they feel fully fleshed out with flaws that we believe.<br /><br />Howey is a fearless writer!  He's not afraid to take risks and IMHO, they pay off in spades!
B0018RC7QE|1.0|This movie is about nothing but adultery. Fall in love before you get married. I like a movie that lifts my spirit not show how selfish people can be.
B0099116AY|4.0|I guess what I liked best about this movie is that it seemed so real to life.  This is the kind of thing that happens to so many married couples.  In this instance it had a happy ending, but my heart ached for them as they struggled through issues.  I saw mistakes that they were making that I have seen so may others make.<br /><br />Why didn't I give it five stars?  Does any movie deserve five stars?  Very few.  It was a very good movie, but I haven't seen a five star movie since To Kill A Mockingbird.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A great love story that keeps you wanting more. As a mother of a young child I found it to be very tasteful and a joy to read.
B00000G2V4|2.0|I expected much more from this production; what a let down; too many duets and other busy-ness going on here
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I think she is a very good writer. I first read Flynn's Girl Gone. Really liked it. She's  dark and different. So I then got the previous two books. Even better!!  All written really well, but the preceding a bit darker. I hope someone bought the movie rights to this book and not just Girl Gone because this is a far more engrossing story!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Of the three &#34;Men In Black&#34; films, this latest edition is easily the best of the three.  It had the best storyline.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was pulled in to this story from page one.  I could not put it down.  I am in love with Holder and think he is probably the best boyfriend out of the most recent books I've read.  The story line is sad....it made my heart hurt and stomach ache for what happened with Sky......but how Holder helps her and guides her is absolutely amazing!  I can honestly say I could only put this book down ONCE, and that was to finally go to sleep!!  Woke up and finished it!! LOVED IT!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The only reason this game is not getting five stars is because they only give you five hints, period.  Forever.  If you want or need more hints after that then you have to purchase them.  Had I realized that I would not have squandered them in the beginning when I was learning.  They should give you five hints for each package, then require purchase.  That would be more fair.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|its super fun its on of the best games ever! so fun and super entertaining its fun for all ages
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is great game to pass the time,very enjoyable lots of levels to get your head round, go on give it a go.by
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A book I could not lay down, The characters, some of them a carry over from the first book of the trilogy and the new ones added were so real and their thoughts were so on for the period and places they were at the time of WW11. I know it is fiction but he really made the cruelity of war come through and how mankind either rises up to defeat that or becomes part of it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Every relationship has growing pains, right??? Well perhaps not to the extreme that Gideon and Eva experience but never-the-less, this book continues the engaging story line between those two and doesn't stop at any point throughout. Leaving you longing for more on the last page and in high anticipation for the 3rd installment of this series.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite at times feeling as if I wanted to smack one or both of the lead characters for acting with the maturity of high schoolers. :) Otherwise, I couldn't put this book down. Would highly recommend this series to any and all who enjoy reading about the depths that people will endure and overcome for love/security/balance/etc, no matter how horrible one's past was, or if you're just in the mood to read through some pleasurable sex scenes as there are many.
0143038419|5.0|i loved reading this book. it was surprising that i did so much after reading some negative reviews about it. i found her to be comical at times but in a good way. when i was reading this book i was in the pray/love section of the book when my grandfather passed away. i found that her talking about finding religion and love helped me thru that period. but all in all it was a good book.
B00846REIS|5.0|From page one, I was hooked into this book/series and couldn't book my Kindle down. The characters of Eva and Gideon are wonderfully depicted along with the supporting characters who add their own flare to the story along the way. Great sex scenes, passionate love for one another, and the inevitable turmoil that comes with building a relationship take the reader on a roller-coaster ride that you won't want to get off of. Highly recommend this series!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|If you like Kelly Clarkson, this will be one the &#34;must haves&#34; in your collection.  The quality of her voice and the amazing lyrics in her songs can really stir up some emotions when you take the time to listen.  In comparison to so many other young singers today - they are a match and Kelly is the sun.<br />Quality recording by an outstanding artist.  Couldn't ask for much more.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|First, after reading several reviews for this book, I'm baffled at those who rated this book with 1 star claiming that the book was too &#34;formulaic&#34; or &#34;predictable&#34;. Umm......it's a Sparks novel. If you're not painfully aware that he writes with a similar theme in all of his books, that's unfortunate for you because in nearly every book, the characters will fall in love quickly, experience some uncertainty, deal with a creepy character of some sort, someone will die, and there will be a happy ending. And if you are aware yet choose to read his novels anyway, that's on you and there really isn't room to complain about it.<br /><br />Second, for all of the other 1 or 2 star raters that are &#34;outraged&#34; due to the copying nature of the plot from previous movies, that's just silly. Movies/TV/books are all re-made with the story tellers on flare. What's the big deal??? Despite similarities to previous stories told, this book is still engaging so I'm unclear as to what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Lastly, this book is yet another fun, easy read that encapsulates all of what Sparks does best (see basic plot development notes above). Knowing the movie is coming out soon, I wanted to read this novel and compare it to the flick. Envisioning Josh Duhammel as Alex throughout the book didn't hurt either. :) If you plan to read this novel knowing there will be an heir of predictability to it, you'll have no problem enjoying this book.
B00064X3FE|5.0|I was very pleased with this item and it was everything that it was advertised to be. Thanks very much
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book ought to be read by students in countries where they are not asked to read this. It's sad,funny and a wonderful story
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. I Love spider solitare. Highly recommended for all ages and levels. I get so excited when I win a game. :) The colors and background are pleasant as well.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best slender app. It is scarier than the computer. I was playing and i turned around to find him with all tentacle-arms squirming. My sister was terrofied and screamed as she jumped back. It is worth five bucks but luckily it is only about two dolars.
B00571F26Y|5.0|i find it hard to believe that some one didnt know this years ago, although cows are fed grain to fatten them up, why didnt some one realise it fattens up people to, will try hard to stick to the no wheat diet but the bloody stuff is every where , thanks so much for the info .
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was amazing, it kept me guessing through the entire story and I can't wait to read the next one!
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|This is very easy to use and it reads almost anything! I love it. I use it with Ubuntu 12.10 and have never had a problem with it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So sad, probably the worst and saddest one of the series, but even though I cried throughout it, it was still very good and exciting. At the end when Katniss and Buttercup were laying on the bed crying about Prim, I could totally picture that in my mind, Katniss crying in the pillow and Buttercup sitting up wailing. I was so angry at Gale at the end, how in the world could he just leave Katniss and go to District 2?! But it was so sweet that when Katniss came home Peeta was in the garden planting primroses in memory of Prim. I don't know who I would recommend this to because everyone that I know has already read this book!<br /><br />-The Original Grape Juice (:
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|Got this tot a Christmas present for my son. He loved it. He is such a lego kid! The only thing he mentioned is that it is smaller than he thought it was going be. Other than that he loves it!
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Ordered it [and Men in Black] to replace VHS copies.  As I already knew it was a good movie, Nothing more has to be said.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is vary good. I love the graphics and I like that you have to catch animals your self. Good game I think you should get it. Good game.
0345803485|2.0|Wasn't a fan.  Just seemed like the writer was trying to shock you more than anything and the main character got a little annoying.  I know I'm &#34;supposed&#34; to love it, but I just got bored halfway through and never finished.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|8 Movies for 1 realy low price, i could not pass it up, gave it as a gift , She loved it
0316056863|5.0|Hilarious and fun read.  I love Tina Fey and this book was a funny look into her life and the various shows she has worked on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book started out slow for me, but then I couldn't put it down! In the end I don't know who I even feel sorry for......not to give anything away. Fantastic read!
0955153077|5.0|i recomend this i item to everyone, who likes the digital art.. artbooks are great it shows you many technique how to draw..
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Of course, the movie was wonderful in theatres, and I ordered this as a stocking stuffer before Christmas. I love that it was an actual DVD, which is what I ordered, but also had an Instant digital download that came with the purchase.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a fantastic movie, with a timely message about environmental issues and what happens to animals and to people when we use too much.<br /><br />Price was very good and this made an excellent stocking stuffer for my niece at Christmas.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like all the option buttons. It gets me where I want to be, although not with one click, but 2.<br /><br />I would recommend this APP as it saves a few clicks on the key pad.
B0017DJ3UW|4.0|Good product. this item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Easy to fit Kindle into, Great protection and excellent easel to hold tablet. I would highly recommend this item I would buy it again
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I have loved Les Mis in its many manifestations on stage and screen and especially appreciate the music. Apparently, the musical performance was second to the spectacle of the movie. The reviews have not been kind and I agree with Russel Crow that the director was attempting to associate a real connection with the characters. But, I feel that although the singing was sincere, it left me feeling quite disappointed. Hugh Jackman is a talented singer and I felt his talent was greatly diminished in this album/movie. I probably won't listen to this much as it makes me wince too often.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|The writing is very good and elegant and it worths reading the book only because of that, but the story is something else. The first half of the book is brilliant. That's the part which takes place in US, while the narrator is interviewing people related to Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. The book is full of interesting phrases and has a sharp insite into social life and relationships. But when the plot moves to the ficional island of San Lorenzo, the interesting stuff became rarer and rarer and what was intelligent and funny became dull and boring. Sometimes I had the feeling I started reading a certain book and finished reading a completely different one.
B008GJV0ZG|4.0|Loved the movie, what I saw of it. It quit downloading 20 minutes prior to the end!!! Would like to see the ending.
B0087ZG7PW|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock's greatest works. The suspense and horror is well played. Ahead of his time with computer animations as well.
1400052181|4.0|It was a book my daughter had to read during the summer.  She did enjoy it.  She found it interesting and inspiring.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Absolutely worthless. Not worth the trouble of down loading. Easier to use the full internet site then to use this app.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I haven't tried this on large or thick knives yet but it works very well on knives with a length of a few inches or so. It definitely sharpened the edge. I wouldn't say it's super razor sharp to shave your hair but it is still pretty sharp nonetheless.It is at a nice price aswell.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book!! I love books that suck u in and keep u reading. A good twist of romance and suspense keeps u wanting more, crazy book! Loved it for making want to cry and laugh! A must read! I don't think I will be able to stop thinking about this book for awhile!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not a reader by any means! I don't think I've ever actually made it through a whole book but I couldn't put it down finished it in about a week. Can't wait to read the others!
B008Y7GPY6|3.0|I really liked the movie and keep thinking through out the movie, \\"this surly can't be the whole movie!\\" Then when I saw that amazon had it in HD I LOLed! Overall I liked the plot, not sure if I could watch it again though!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is not like one of those cheesy dragon breeding games. Never should be called one. It's entertaining, easy to understand, full of great graphics, and money is NOT required, which I find awesome on a game. I now have Dragonvale on both my iPod touch and kindle, and have never stopped loving it. Keep up the awesome work, Backflip!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Bought this item for my daughter for Christmas - she is still a kid at heart and will enjoy this movie with her boys.
B003G4W49C|1.0|What wrong with ya'll?  This book sucks.<br /><br />I wasn't taken with it from the very beginning.  Then came the kiss of death.  There are hardly any girls in the program because of thousands of years of evolution has left female unable to do this man-work.  Or boy-work.<br /><br />I spot read most of the rest of the book and found I missed nothing in my assessment of this book and author.  This dude is weird and can't imagine females in fighting roles.  Can women control a drone?  Can women float around playing war?<br /><br />Let this crap go back into obscurity.
0395389496|5.0|My oldest grandson asked for this book and the movie for Christmas.  Of course, I had to spoil him just a little.
B004AQR24W|4.0|This is a fun movie to just veg out to. Don't expect anything special, it's just an action movie and it's a good one. Enjoy it for that.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i read both Slammed and the sequel from c. hoover. Hopeless was even better. the story was great from the first chapter on. i actually even shed a tear! WTH?? i never do that.
0307346617|5.0|Novel approach to book.  Basically it's a collections of interviews that paint a picture over time.  The stories are all over the place.  Some are very intense, others are passable. Not havin strong characters that you can gravitate towards is frustrating.  However, some of the realism is just awesome.  From personal stories to the actions of governments....it's so accurate, inspiring, shocking and at times disturbing.  I could not put the book down.  If you like the genre it's a must read.  I can see it spawning the upcoming movies and connected novels.  Lots of depth to the foundation of the stories.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|The discs themselves were unplayable on my machine obviously designed to play only in the American region. The packaging was poor and arrived in a broken state. They were returned within 2 days.<br /><br />Very disappointed.<br /><br />John
B0090EJR1K|1.0|This is about the most ridiculous, not funny movie I have ever seen!!  I have seen other movies like this that are funny, this one is not!!
034580404X|5.0|Great reads, someone reccommended the first book to me when they raved so much and i saw the set i grabbed fast and happy i did
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS PIECE OF S____.  Can't think of any other ways to say AWFUL waste of  time.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is really a great game all around. Unfortunately, you really have to have friends online who play too in order to advance quickly. However, my mum and I both play now, so it's pretty fun and silly when other family members watch us &quot;compete&quot; to see who can unlock the next character first and whatnot. We've got family members playing ages 50, 23, 6, and 4, and we all have a blast!
1407130293|4.0|the movie was okay but the books are great. the books go in to more detal than the movie. I recamed it to my freinds and family.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game over all. There are many different mini games which were fun to do. A fun game to pass some time.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|ZeptoLab has done it again... first cut the rope and now Pudding Monsters who knows what they will come up with next!!! Amazing Game!!!!!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played!!!!  I love to have &quot;comment conversations&quot; and to find my friends so we can play! The gameplay is fun and challenging. You don't have to be a good artist to play.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I'll admit, it took me a few pages to get into the groove of the modern version of a old favorite, but once I did- I couldn't put it down!  I am looking so forward to the sequel!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Gritty story about contemporary English life in a small town.  When someone dies unexpectedly, leaving a vacancy on the equivalent of the town  council, a dramatic local power struggle develops. I was drawn in by the character development.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy does it again. Could not put the book down once I started reading it. Sometimes I hate Clancy because he causes me many sleepless nights. He is so good.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is OK but it still is not the challange, or as intertaining as the old forty thieves, or even the plain Solitaire on Windows 7.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Great story!  I've been a fan of David Mack since the SCE series of e-books and when I found out he'd written this trology, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  As always, he has engaging character development and knows just how far he can push the boundaries of the current EU for Star Trek in order to create wonderful scenarios.
B0025KVLV0|3.0|The material on The Beatles' \\"last record\\" LET IT BE was recorded in early 1969. These sessions were ultimately abandoned and John, Paul, George and Ringo got together later in the year and successfully recorded the ABBEY ROAD album. Once the Beatles broke up, LET IT BE was issued and began the trend of cashing in on their legacy by issuing archival recordings.<br /><br />None of the material here is particularly strong, I find. The Beatles continue their move away from mid-decade psychedelia (which in my opinion was the height of their career). On songs like \\"One After 909\\", \\"Get Back\\" and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", the band connects with the American rock music of the late 1950s that originally inspired them. At the time of these sessions, John Lennon was said to be aloof from the band and addicted to heroin, and his LSD-induced altered consciousness of previous years is sorely missed here. The only distinctly Lennon song, \\"Across the Universe\\", is a half-hearted effort. On top of this weak material, Phil Spector came in and added lush orchestral backing. The result is rather grotesque, because it does indeed sound like an outside figure is imposing his differing vision on songs that were meant to be for simple forces.<br /><br />Since a few songs here (especially the title track) have become bedrocks of Western musical culture, I cannot totally trash this album. Evidentally it resonates with people down the decades. However, among the Beatles's mature discography, I'd much rather listen to anything else.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|I would like to see a disclaimer added every time this album is referenced...\\"CAN YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING\\" IS NOT CONSIDERED A HIGHTLIGHT OF LES MISERABLES! Poor choice and would have rated this zero stars if possible.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|One can only sit back and gasp at the cleverness of this novel - so many histories, so many stories, so many links - all brought together at the end!  I can't wait to read it again in a year or so, I'm sure it will be even more rewarding a second time around.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Camera work and effects were great. It had some nice pace of action and the actor played a good Conan but plot and character development were non existant sadly. The original still the best Conan movie if only for its charm.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Enjoyable, old-school puzzle game.  I heard about it being one of the favorite games for the old Sega DreamCast, so I decided to give it a try.  So far, it has been a lot of fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you like Twilight you will like this book. It is for a more mature reader. I am 40 years young and my husband and I just celebrated our 16 year Anniversary. Fun book! I hope there will be a movie soon.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Followed all insructions but couldn't print out an email or anything else from anywebsite so this app doesn't  help me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This can be very addictive and challenging.  My 12 year old granddaughter got me started playing.  We enjoy challenging each other.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've never been a big history buff, in fact I hated it in school.  This second novel of the Century Trilogy has opened my eyes to what really was going on during WWII.  Something about following the different families through the two wars has made the whole thing more personal to me.  After reading this, I actually had trouble getting into Michael Connery's latest Harry Bosch novel -- and I LOVE Harry!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I feel this book was just blah. I didn't feel it had a point and was hard to follow due to the way it was written and the immature nature of the main character.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like hidden object games and I found this one to be lots of fun.  The tasks were not real difficult but, they were interesting enough to keep me wanting to play longer.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Harks back to some of my favorite elements in terms of construction and action.  I've read them all and nothing could dissuade me from continuing to do so!  I love these guys separately and together.
B004SDEP38|3.0|uninstalled the app. I needed a very intuitive app for a newbie to tablets and this is not it. Nice try.
B0019IB0II|3.0|I am a neurology nurse and I love to read first hand accounts like this. Unfortunately, I was really hoping for more personal stories, rather than an educational book. It wasn't what I thought it would be as far as an &#34;interesting read,&#34; but I think it would be an excellent resource for someone who might have had a left hemisphere stroke.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|First J. Grisham book I have read in awhile.  The Racketeer is entertaining with some surprises & twist and turns along the way.  This read has 'movie' written all over it:)  Does not disappoint.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good graphics. I like games like this. I like the quest type games and find the hidden object games. I like the zoom in feature as well. Good story line.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As many people do, I simply love & adore this show, it's one of the best shows on TV! Everyone will love it!
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|I have seen a lot of Jane Austen's books to movies.  I highly enjoyed this version.  Loved the characters.  Enjoy!
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|Nothing new under the sun!!! I really was expecting more from the series... The franchise fell to plan for a great finally...
B007HACDLK|3.0|I enjoyed this book much more than his last one.  One of the reasons is his language wasn't as offensive.  I realize it is written about men and women in very difficult and dangerous situations, but there doesn't need to be so many swear words.
0374531943|3.0|I'm a fan of space history, and I've read many books on the subject.  This book seems to be a little hard for me to read.  I think I have trouble following along in the way the author wants me to.  I suppose it's because it's written in a different style than I'm used to, so while I have given it a fair shake I'm not sure it's my favorite only because I'm not used to the style of writing that is used.  Many, many people love this book for exactly what it is, so their reviews count for much more.
034580404X|4.0|Steamy, erotic...but a little disappointing.  Probably because I just didn't like that the author made Christian seem 'damaged' and that was why he was dominant...it was amusing to me that the kinky sex wasn't what made him twisted...but just his dominance..lol
B0033AGPF8|4.0|This is a remarkable album.In my opinion it's are you experienced part II.It contains a phenomenal group of songs like &#34;Spanish castle magic&#34;,&#34;You got me floaating&#34;,the title track and the standard &#34;little wing&#34;.&#34;She's so fine&#34; is also great.Very well crafted songs.One of my favorite rock albums definitely.Make yourself a favor a get it from AMAZON.You won't regret it.The vinyl arrived in perfect condition without any flaws.The sound is really great ,very quiet record.I'm back to vinyls and I can tell you that I hear some things that I don't hear on the cd.These guys are making great work with jimi's vinyls and cds.Congratulations and thanks a lot.The art work is also fantastic.You've got some pictures and comments about the story and influence of the album.I rate the product 4 stars because I got it late.But I strongly recommend this album for your library.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I couldn't have been more pleased with this book. I cried and I really felt the pain of the characters. It was incredible. A must read.
B002WJI66C|5.0|A great small plush for Mario and Nintendo fans. The tag is also in Japanese which is also kinda cool.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the first week of opening...it was very mooding,heartfelt the whole story line just blew me away ..looking so forward to receiving my DVD when released..loved it
B002WJI65S|5.0|A great small plush for Mario and Nintendo fans. The tag is also in Japanese which is also kinda cool.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|i loved it and was completely happy with this cd for many reason. First Kelly Clarkson has been one of my favorite singer since 2005 when i heard Since You Been Gone. second i love the track listing on this cd all of my favorite song was on it even a couple of new favorite like People Like Us and Catch My Breath. I total recomend it to any Kelly fans and anyone who loves good music!
145210655X|5.0|Gave this super funny gift from my son to my husband.  They both enjoy the pictures and the captions.  A must have for a family that loves Star Wars.
0385535147|5.0|I purchased &#34;The Racketeer&#34; for my wife. She is a John Grisham fan. She has not started reading it yet. I am sure that she will enjoy it once she starts reading it. It came within in the time frame stated. I will consider future purchases through Amazon.<br /><br />Thank You,<br /><br />Jay Taunton
B000002AGN|5.0|Loved Brubeck from the late 40's, enjoying his music while he played in the central Calif. valley!  A truly gifted musician and the world lost another of the &#34;greats&#34; in the music world.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|An interesting concept - a bit drawn out & repititioous at times - but an enjoyable read - with a predictable ending
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a good read. I enjoyed the unpredictable story line that kept me guessing to the end. Good characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book  down!!<br /><br />I could not put this book down, one of the best I've ever read.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I was surprised by the way the game limits what and where and when you can draw things... but pleased by the overall creative feel and game mechanics.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|An interesting storyline, but as in every book by Nicholas Sparks, I had a hard time relating to the characters. The main couple seemed rather unemotional and stoic. Overall, it is an easy read for the weekend.
B0068RQ85K|4.0|I have only had these products for about three weeks.<br />Works very well just as stated in the advertisement. Have not had time or all the materials to completely test it completely.<br />I am looking forward to work with the Gizmos Coiling tools in the future.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I am 16 and have watched the show religiously. The book is similar but a lot more happened in a small time span. This book sort of reminded me of The Clique series.  A little young for me but I enjoyed it.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Being this is the first Reacher novel I know the story lines get better.  I had a little difficulty going with this line, but I always enjoy Jack Reacher no matter what!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book had a decent plot and i felt the characters were well built. I like the fact that Argon is kept mysterious. One thing that i must point out is that Thor is handed too many perks too fast and it seems his character is being rushed. Also i felt some of the battles were over before they started as there was no buildup. Overall i did like this book very much and will follow the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on my phone and kindle and like it. I have had no problems on either device. Great little app.
B0091REZMW|4.0|You have to be rich to really enjoy the game. You have to buy, with real money, &quot;diamonds&quot; and &quot;Coins. I got 55$ for Xmas for Kindle and now after playing im left with 30, with this game alone!!!
B009UMTMKS|3.0|Don't get me wrong - it's an amazing book. A must read for anyone who is working in/on a startup.<br />But comparing to the original book (not &#34;the manual&#34;) this is one very heavy.<br /><br />On one hand, the manual style is useful because you can use it as a reference, as your &#34;wing man&#34; in case if you are about to make a decision or you are stuck. Helped me get very important view from a side on my problem not once, and helped unblock my thoughts in some tough problems. But the manual style actually diminishes the value of the book as it skips on some important explanations (at least where it feels like that an explanation is due) settling on just a prescription.<br /><br />So read it - but don't hold your expectations too high.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My teen and pre-teen daughters loved this movie and have watched it a few times already.  The performances are good and it makes for some light entertainment.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|I went into this movie with reservations, as I'd read reviews online and heard other people talking about the movie. I'm glad I was open-minded enough to actually watch the movie because it sure was funny. Granted it's basically the first film transposed into Bangkok but how awesome is it to juxtapose the glitter of Vegas with the squalor of Thailand? (The monk boner/monkey scene shows how much further they could have taken it) As in the first each cast member does an excellent job of contributing their brand of comedy to the film and I did not feel at all like the cast members where trying to one up each other. Overall a solidly put together sequel that is a worthy predecessor to the first.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very easy to use,very large size for ease of reading. I would recommend this app for everyone.
B005V20JKI|4.0|honestly one of my favorite games on my phone, fun game play, good character variety, challenging but not frustrating boards. A favorite in my house, from my 5 year old to my 8 year old AND 37 year old spouse. but why isn't it available on the kindle fire hd? hoping it's coming soon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so much better than most of the books I read I don't think I have all of the words I need to describe how intense, sad, beautiful, tragic, sensual, rewarding, I could go on and on but the truth of the matter is you need to read this book<br />I loved this book. All through the story you keep asking yourself \\"Why did Holder do that?\\"just like Sky does. Why is he acting like that? All is revealed with-in the story. You don't have to wait till the next book. When it says The End it is. Thank goodness for a change. I would like to tell the readers a little about this book but I'm afraid to disclose something crucial because there are so many twists and turns and surprises and heartwarming friendships and I don't want to give it away before you need to know. I think this book was beautifully written. Some of the descriptions take you there, like you are one of the characters. I recommend this book.
1594744769|5.0|What an amazing book.  I read it with my book club and we all were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it.  Now we are ready for &#34;the next&#34; story.
B0000DJZB9|3.0|I guess I am a fan up to November Rain and then the Videos get a little goffey for me. I  enjoy the music but did not care for the last few videos. I thought they were stupid. Call me an Appetite for Destruction fan more than the later stuff.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I didn't care much for this Mahjong game, but my 8 year old grandson loves to play it and will play it for hours if I will let him.  Got him a Kindle Fire for Christmas and now we have downloaded this Mahjong game on it for him.  He is in hog heaven.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I really liked the remake a 100% more than the original back in 90. the new Total Recall is action packed from the first few minutes on. The story line made alot more sence to me than the original. I just think it is a great movie. Period.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have played Spider Solitare for years and this one on the Kindle Fire is wonderful.  Would recommend it to anyone that likes to play Spider.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|If the reader decides not to read this book, simply because they aren't interested for whatever reason, that's fine.  Thanks for reading some of these reviews.<br /><br />But if you are not making use of AntiFragile, because of things you've heard or observed about Mr. Taleb, then you might be missing out on messages, on insights, that could benefit you, and possibly save you from enormous & unnecessary losses.<br /><br />It's easy to find examples of Taleb's denigration of personality types he doesn't like with terms like 'nerd'.  Or tyrannically insisting on a web post that a researcher is 'suspicious' because they like their job (NO observer should be telling anybody else to walk away from their passion, merely on the grounds that the observer can't see how to reconcile vocational happiness with integrity, for research-oriented vocations.)  Or claiming that his critics are doing the world harm (some of them really ARE causing damage, Taleb is correct.  But this is too convenient an excuse, for avoiding honest self-examination.  It's ALWAYS possible to find/ invent evil in people you don't like, or who have unexplainably different values than you).<br /><br />But all of this is completely unrelated to the value of the content of AntiFragile; don't let it discourage you from trying to understand what Taleb has to offer.  If I had to summarize the main point - not necessarily professor Taleb's main point, but the main point of the book to ME personally (so far) - it's to help the reader to look at their lives & the world, through a barbell mindset.  A playful effort in exploring THIS alone, will help you to understand antifragility.  For further elaboration on barbells, read some of Taleb's web postings, or just obtain Antifragile, read the introduction, and read all the occurrences of 'barbell'.<br /><br />I'm about 35 percent through the book right now, but needed to write up the review, give the book the credit it deserves, and get the review out of the way.  Perhaps it isn't true for everyone, but I have found that reading a book with the intent of writing a review about it, gives you much less value than taking your time, reflecting, reading more, and in general just enjoying the experience.  Better to get this done now, and avoid wasting the other 65 percent of the book & probably 4-5 re-readings.<br /><br />Antifragile truly does deserve the 5 stars.  Whatever Taleb's internal motivations, be they profit; or a chance to take pot shots at personality types he dislikes; or genuine altruism, AntiFragile is a valuable gift.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Have all of the previous seasons of the Vampire Diaries series so had to have this one also.  Will really enjoy watching this over and over again as the entire family, adults that is, love this series and look forward to it coming back.  Have already ordered the  5th season, even though it hasn't been released yet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was far better than the movie. The richness of the inner soul searching does not come across in the film. Th he fear and the battle to stay alive has a much darker twist in the book.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Have all of the previous seasons of the Sons of Anarchy series so had to have this one also.  Will really enjoy watching this over and over again as the entire family, adults that is, love this series and look forward to it coming back.  Have already ordered the next, 5th season, even though it hasn't been released yet.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Michael Connelly is always a good writer with a good plot and characters - I really enjoyed this one too and found the descriptions of the whole riots incorporated into the story, as a person from another country, very interesting
B005K17RU0|2.0|I really didn't care for this app as it didn't seem to be very accurate in predicting the weather or even telling me what the weather is at the present time.  I have since deleted this app from my Kindle Fire.
B003YJEXL6|5.0|I got the impression the author was losing sight of the thesis at some points, but I liked those points anyway. This book is a useful, immensely well-researched, intelligently-written and argued piece of work with a nice tinge of irony. I feel like the author provides a well-backed scientific perspective, and gives an interesting primer to feminist issues in the first world. I kind of felt that sexism was over for the longest time, and now I see some ways that we would benefit from a more gender-neutral society. I really admire clear scientific writing, but most feminist literature is written in an annoying tradition of postmodern obscuritanism. This is a style of work I can respect, and was necessary for me to appreciate the subject. I wish I had encountered this long ago.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Have used this app very little since I downloaded it on the Kindle Fire.  Works fine but since I usually just do math in my head don't really need it even though I have kept it in case of an emergency or if someone doubts my math abilities.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great read by Grisham. The plot evolved as the story goes to a conclusion. Awesome. One of my favorite authors.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Have really enjoyed all of the Vampire Diaries series and have bought all of the seasons that have came out.  Will enjoy these in the future when the Vampire Diaries series is no longer on TV and I need my vampire fix.
B00009UW0N|2.0|First, let me say that I love &#34;Halloween&#34; so this review is not about the movie itself.<br /><br />I purchased this DVD new. Upon inspection, both discs appeared to have bounced around the case many times. Both discs were scratched and stained and even appeared to have fingerprints on them. The center disc holder was broken on both sides, which may account for the disc damage.<br /><br />I am playing the movie as I write this and it appears that it is in acceptable shape. However, when you purchase something &#34;new&#34;, you expect &#34;new&#34; quality.<br /><br />I love the movie. I hate the fact that my product was damaged and, possibly, used.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this type of game.  Makes you think and it helps a person become visual in their thinking.  Have put in may hours playing it.  A little hard in some of the later games for children, but my daughters and older grandchildren love it also.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So enjoyed this second book in Follett's trilogy. Can hardly wait for the third book to be published.<br />Follett is such a excellent writer and historian. One learns so much for about political and economical the reasons behind both WW1 and WW2.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Had not used this game before and it doesn't seem to work well for me so have deleted it from my Kindle Fire.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the size of the calculator and my kids use to help with homework. I also love the colors. keep up the good work.
B002SS8S7E|4.0|Quality was good in HD But after watching halfway it froze and had to watch it in normal..had to stop it and go back so I could watch it in HD
B0032Y0OH0|3.0|I do video editing as a hobby and I think this is a great starter device for the money. Easy to set up and you will reduce your editing time in half. Great price!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was an awesome book. Loved everything about this book. I would recommend this book to anybody!<br />Enough said.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Had a heck of a time getting wireless win 7 laptop to be seen without remote/dish icon and connecting.  Kindle fire hd was on same wireless router, added specific ip address but still no dice. Finally added a hardwired pc that was on a separate router and maybe coincidentally, it worked for both devices.<br /><br />One note - I needed an external Bluetooth keyboard to enter text as the soft keyboard didn't come up when needed.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|I read this book on a plane from Denver to Kazakhstan. It made for a gripping read, but I have heard rumors it never happened. C'est la vie.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is a really well written story and great follow up to the last edition. Has plenty of action as well.
B000002KXV|5.0|I first bought it in 1982 and continue to give it as a gift. The keyboard chords translate perfectly to the guitar. The cold war revisited. It's Da Bomb.
1593082037|2.0|Some of these movies are from HUNGER.  The early, early EARLY ones I could barely follow, too dark, too dense, not good sound.  A few of the later movies are okay, but you can buy those singularly or in DVDs by title.  I would NOT buy this for ANYone.<br />Cecy Ivie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it. it has all the functions that are needed and more. plan but good. good job divitalchemy, llc
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Was a gift, but recipient LOVED it.  Was thrilled about it.  Evidently, color and sound okay and no hiccups.  I have not seen it yet.<br />I Now (Feb 18) have seen.  I find it RIDICULOUS.  Half of the movie is at night or in a dark alien space ship, which they finally find out.  However, in a 2012 movie it is UNexcusable to have this kind of darkness.  You don't know what the hell is going ON most of the time.  I would Not recommend this to ANYone.  Don't waste your money.  This postcedes Alien and Aliens w/Sigourney Weaver.  If you want a GOOD alien movie, buy those!  And this from Ridley Scott also,  God, How Unfortunate!<br />Mar.1, 13.  I stand corrected and apologize.  This movie was FORErunner, I have learned, for Alien/Aliens, etc.  I still feel the same as I first wrote, but wanted to correct my mistake.  The morfed \\"alien\\" suggestion at end of Prometheus is Not good, and I am overjoyed that they came up with a better, more believable, \\"Alien\\" in the movie Alien and Aliens, etc.<br />Cecy Ivie
B0055SWM08|5.0|Like another reviewer stated, the game description did little to pique my interest.  It wasn't until I saw a demo of the game that I became interested.  The tutorial was perfect and now I can't put this game down. I've already recommended the game to a few people.  We need more games like this.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. It lets me listen to the radio stations I grew up listening to even tho I  am now living a thousand miles away.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was so good!  There were so many times where I cried because it was so sweet! A must read!
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome!! This book was amazing I would recommend it to anyone, it is also very very easy to read once you get into it!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|AT 4.99 THIS MOVIE IS STILL NOT WORTH THE PRICE .. CONSIDER YOUR OPPORTUNITY COST. IT SUCKS.  A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Okay, but not a typical Cornwell novel.  I thought there was too much background detail throughout the book.  The plot was hard to follow but very interesting.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|I wasn't expecting an Oscar performance from the two main characters and they didn't deliver one... I was definitely shocked at the ending when it is revealed that this is a real person, and a real case. Ryan Gosling isn't pretty in this one, he's actually fairly ugly through most of it, so if you're watching for just him, don't expect to see Notebook Ryan G.
086571701X|5.0|Aquaponic Gardening is a great intro to aquaponics.  My wife and I have read it several times, and I'm using the table of contents as the outline of my planning binder.  I'd take off the 'almost' if there were a chapter on greenhouses, which I need for Seattle.<br /><br />I like Sylvia Bernstein's information, which is much more efficiently presenting than aquaponics forums, and I like her writing style.  She really loves aquaponics and it shows.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I wanted to enjoy this movie. The story, a man battling himself aged 30 years apart for the sake of the present versus that of the future, sounds compelling. However, it unfolds as if no one ever proofread the script. The gaps in both plot and logic are astounding. While I'm not one to look for cookie-cutter stories, the writers of Looper could've done well by watching any other movie about time travel. It would've helped avoid the pitfalls of confusing basic \\"if/then logic\\" with fantasy. Even Doctor Who does a better job at justifying why its explanations are at least marginally plausible. The weak back story about why looping is necessary and what bridges two characters at different times manages to contradict itself and lacks coherency in ways that are frustrating.<br /><br />In addition to the nonsensical plot line, the pacing of the movie is unnecessarily slow. It gets boring. The action scenes are moderately well done, but are also often plagued by similar nonsensical occurrences, such as bodies and memories that change in the future character in real time as the past character makes different decisions. Issues such as these make the unfolding story seem silly, and distract from scenes that should be gripping, or at least exciting. While explosions, sex, or fights are often successfully used to detract from these problems in other movies, the caliber and number of action scenes in Looper are woefully insufficient to compensate for the content or pacing of the story. Overall, the movie isn't a complete failure, I would say it's not worth the money for renting. Leave it to a slow day on cable.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It was exactly what we expected.  The dvd played flawlessly and sounded great.  Thanks for a great product.  I will be back for more.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Do not purchase this movie if you wish to use the digital copy that Fox has so kindly included.... because it doesn't work. Google &#34;the code you entered is not valid for your region&#34; and you'll see that thousands of people are having issue with Fox and their digital copy issues. The codes that they provide for their digital copy DVD's just do not work in ANY region. This is why people hate DRM and why pirating movies has become so popular- I paid $25 for this movie yet can't even have it on my computer/table/phone.

159562015X|2.0|I'm left wondering whether Bernie Maddof has read this book and diagnosed himself with the strengths like 'Communication' and 'Includer'. The entire Tea Party may have the talent of 'Context' (described in this book as \\"You look back. You look back because that is where the answers lie.\\"). And that is the problem with Strength's Finder 2.0.  There is no context. All 34 behaviors may be exhibited by a variety of people under the right circumstances. Sometimes the behaviors are constructive and appropriate. Yet many of the descriptions found in this book can also be found in their extreme in the Diagnostic Statistics Manual.<br /><br />Understandable since the Strengths Finder instrument was developed by Donald O. Clifton, the grandfather of Positive psychology. However, the person who refuses to face the present or move forward is encouraged to develop this \\"talent\\", and to actually avoid 'Futuristic' activities.<br /><br />On the other hand the author provides advice on working with people who possess these 'talents. He would be wise to read up on 'Context'.
B000093OU8|5.0|Gary Moore was an incredible guitarist! Great songs, great cover of Easybeats Friday on my mind! Overall I recommend it!!
0307887898|4.0|[[ASIN:0670921602 Lean Startup]] Two months after purchasing this book, the Director of our agency ordered us to deliver a new investigations module for our enterprise software. He gave us 30 days. In meeting after meeting, I was able to corral discussions about scope, user experience, and regulations with using Ries's acronym M.V.P. (Minimum Viable Product).  Our first prototype was shot down by the end users, so we followed Ries's advice and \\"pivoted.\\" Ries describes a pivot as \\"a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product . . .\\" We delivered on time, and spent 2012 collecting feedback & metrics (see below), then releasing new features to the M.V.P. base on our analysis and more prototyping.<br /><br />Ries also covers metrics in his Lean Startup approach. His book was a great help when I launched a website. Wading through the plethora of available books and tools, I was able to avoid what Ries labels \\"vanity metrics.\\"Vanity metrics are 'unactionable' stats such as number of unique visitors, which provide no useful appraisal of how customers are responding.<br /><br />From the opening chapters, I found The Lean Startup to be useful in actual business situations. It's organized into 3 sections (Vision, Steer, Accelerate), which approximate successive stages of a Startup. I found myself returning to Vision often.  Steer focuses on metrics, so it may take longer to understand and apply.
B006GSRFOY|5.0|This 1974 album by Thin Lizzy is awesome. It's not even the best album they did! Also the second disc alone is worth the price!! Recommended!!
B00333IA1M|5.0|The Gilbert translation is, in my opinion, closest to the original French novel and a must read for any serious student of Albert Camus. The book itself was exactly as described in the seller's notes and delivered very quickly.

B0013ND30M|5.0|Pricy for a used item but presentation (packaging) was great and the movie was just as I remembered as a child. My 3 year old didnt know it was used. We love it and were glad we could get it online without having to wait for it to &#34;come out of the disney vault&#34;
B0068FYZH0|4.0|A Beautiful Mind, based on a true story, is an emotional and terrifically acted drama that qualifies as one of Russell Crowe's best performances to date. Crowe is absolutely brilliant as John Nash, a gifted but troubled genius and his journey through life. Jennifer Gardner portrays John's faithful wife and is more than deserving of the Oscar she won for her role in the film. The movie deals with sensitive subjects, such as conspiracy theories and mental illness, but does so in a touching way that ultimately leaves the audiences feeling uplifted.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|An utterly compelling novel that will play havoc with your schedule -- this is one that's hard to put down. Louisa Clark is a small-town girl whose life is circumscribed by her family's poverty and by a scarring incident that occurredwhen she was 16. Will Traynor was a wealthy London financial wizard and globe-trotting athletic hearthrob -- until an accident left him paralyzed from the neck down. Will and Louisa seem to have little in common, except the shared restrictions they both chafe under, but they learn to listen and care for one another.  Moyes writes the story with grace and humor; the banter and black comedy exchanges that the two share are wonderfully written. Although there are one or two excerpts where Moyes' views on assisted suicide seem to be a bit agenda-driven, for the most part, she wisely allows the wonderful characters she's developed to live and breathe the story to its poignant conclusion.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|From the first page to the last, a captivating read. I cant wait to get into the next installment..  :)
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|SPOILERS AHEAD.  I've read nearly everything Courtney Milan has written and loved every book -- except this one.  The plot is just too strained for me, and I'm typically easily able to suspend disbelief in romance novels.  In this tale, however, a duke decides to anonymously foment workers' unions as a way of redeeming his horrible fathers' cruelty and greed, and no one seems to realize that if he simply spent his money and energy in improving workers' situations and pay, his efforts would be much more effective than stirring up unrest. The heroine's situation is just as ludicrous: raised as a boy who plays chess, she was found out and stoned and is now living under an assumed identity working for hygienic reforms.  Milan's previous novels have been outstanding for the emotional chemistry the two protagonists share, but the zeal for reform is the big emotional draw in this novel.  The hero and heroine deserve each other, but readers don't deserve the wooden characters, overly melodramatic dialogue, nor the completely absurd plotting.  Still, I'll be reading more of Milan -- this one just wasn't to my taste.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely fabulous! I read it in one day. I smiled, I laughed, I cried! I am in love with the couple in the book & root for them from the start!
0812993292|5.0|An amazingly beautiful and poignant story of a man who walks out to post a letter of condolence to a dying friend -- and without intending to, somehow keeps on walking in an effort to keep faith and keep her alive-- for 87 days and 627 miles. Here's one of my favorite bits: \\"He had learned that it was the smallness of people that filled him with wonder and tenderness, and the loneliness of that too. The world was made up of people putting one foot in front of the other; and a life might appear ordinary simply because the person living it had been doing so for a long time. Harold could no longer pass a stranger without acknowledging the truth that everyone was the same, and also unique; and that this was the dilemma of being human\\" (158).

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has some great games and is a great way to pass time and there are many different games so you never get bord.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I would not have believed you could make something beyond the limits of a comic novel out of this extremely random mix of personalities and backgrounds, but somehow Joss Whedon did.  Each character was given the opportunity to contribute to the story in a significant way and the banter was a lot of fun. I may have given it five stars if not for Loki's horned outfit looking so ridiculous.<br /><br />If you wait for the end of the credits, there's a great last shot.
0891419063|5.0|I just finished reading this....I am speechless. I would say that it is virtually impossible to ever put into words what it means to be a Marine, to survive combat, and describe the pride that goes along with earning the title. But if there was ever a book that came close to painting the right picture, this book is it. It is not only a testament to the Marines, but more importantly it is a testament to all those who have defended this nation and had to endure the horrors of combat....Sledge's firsthand account of his time in the Marines is truly why we have the saying...\\"(America is the) Home of the free, because of the Brave.\\"
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|I thought this performance would be a shadow of the band from the 70's but was pleasantly surprised.  Robert is in good voice and Jimmy's fretwork is very good!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I played this on Facebook, but I like it much better on my Kindle! Quick energy refill, earn easy coins, doesn't always require real $$ to complete quests.<br /><br />I just need more friends to complete some of the quests
B00A12VJZM|3.0|It's a good compilation and filled out the holes in my collection.  I would recommend it for someone who would like to listen to the broad spectrum of styles across their history.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|It was pretty cheesy!  It definitely wasn't what we expected.  The music was good though, but the acting, was mediocre, especially when such high esteemed actors were supposed to be in it!
B003H9MSPG|1.0|This product is awful. It is no where close to 30 feet in shooting especially with the longer barrel. it shoots like 2 feet. when i got it with in two days the clip broke. Don't get it unless u want an awful toy.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child never disappoint with plot twists and new surprises in every Pendergast novel.  They kept their promise with &#34;Two Graves.&#34;  All questions were answered about Helen's murky past.  The reader is taken on a heartbreaking journey with our hero, who knows the truth can come with a heavy price.  Did Alban survive?  Will he, like his uncle Diogenes, rise from the ashes like the Phoenix and cause more pain for his father?  I can't wait to see what happens next!
0374214913|4.0|I loved the plot, the characters, and the puzzle of the bookstore.  However, I found the ending a bit trite and anticlimactic.  On the other hand, the description of and relationship between printed \\"old knowledge\\" and electronic \\"new knowledge\\" was intriguing.  Also, the \\"inside\\" look at Google was absolutely fascinating (I wonder if this is an accurate representation?).
B0094BB4TW|3.0|needs more functionality. would be wonderful to have more than the mobile app. and be able to manage my Facebook account with my kindle instead of just log on and comment.
146500632X|3.0|Its not really that cheap. I got my daughter one at ShopKo for $7.00 and they have them at the mall for $7.50. This one is still a good calendar but you can get it cheaper at other places.....
B0055MBQOM|4.0|Used this on a mac. I've got 2 different brands of monitors that I have never been able to exactly match up the colors on. This thing did a great job of it. I've used it on a lot of different monitors and it builds profiles that look great on most of them.<br />Only one complaint. I don't use much direct light when working and it's measurement of Ambient light seemed a little off to me, making the LCD way too dim. Turned on the main lights and let it measure again, then it got the brightness to a comfortable level. If you leave it plugged in, it'll notify you if the ambient lighting changes but I don't use that feature.<br /><br />If you're really serious about photo editing or color grading, you'll want something more high-end but this gets most of the way there for not too bad a price. I actually have a dedicated 709 reference monitor for my color work but it's nice having my Computer monitor somewhere in the same ballpark.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I was at 5/8 pages and thought this was a ripoff at first, because he had never appeared, and just as I find page 6, he gets me. After that my Mom and I spent some time playing and enjoying ourselves. Aside from being scared ourselves a few times we spooked Dad the first time Slenderman appeared. He scared both of us to which we naturally yelled and of course freaked out Dad.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great cast, love Maggie Smith, and season 3 is definitely keeping things interesting.  Highly recommend that everyone check out Downton Abbey.
B0086213XW|1.0|This movie just sucked.  Seth Rogan should never have associated himself with it.  Slow, clumsy, predictable and incredibly sad and depressing.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|A good funny story for all age groups. Offers a new twist on the story of Santa Claus. Well done.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written - how time flies when you 'get into' a book!  Will be reading more from Flynn in the near future.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|[[ASIN:B00AQ3K8IU Hopeless]] should be on any self-respecting bibliophile's 2013 must read list. It takes the reader on an unsuspecting journey that even now reading the description doesn't do it justice. If you haven't read this novel yet, you should stop reading and get it NOW. Seriously, YOU should really stop reading this review and purchased this novel NOW.<br /><br />But if you must continue... in simple terms it's beyond amazing. This work of fiction took me on such a twisted emotional rollercoaster the likes of which I hadn't been on since reading the novel [[ASIN:B004S5C91Q Room]] by Emma Donohue. I thought [[ASIN:B008TRUDAS Slammed]] and [[ASIN:B008TRU9HU Point of Retreat]] were astounding but this takes it to another level.<br /><br />When I first purchased this book I only knew too things: Colleen Hoover wrote it, which was a good enough reason unto itself, and my sister wanted to read it. It's a rarity that my sister is more enthused about a book than me. I'm usually bringing her to the bandwagon. For those two reasons I didn't research the book I just bought it.<br /><br />Once I started reading I never put it down. I knew from the opening chapter that I was in for something special. I turned off my analytical side of my brain and just enjoyed the show. It didn't disappoint. For me, I'm declaring this the best book of 2013; yes the year is only six days old. They're other releases I'm looking forward to but I don't think they will be as surprising, shocking, engrossing as this novel. I don't think after read this novel anyone would disagree. Go out and get this novel you won't be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds<br /><br />The only way you think about it because it is not responsible and I think about Rio Refinance the clone for younger
B005IQZB14|2.0|Author seems more interested in discussing her sexploits than either backpacking or personal growth. I can' t imagine any reasonable person, faced with a 1000 + mile walk, not breaking in new boots, learning to light a new stove, or seeing what thier new pack was like when trail ready. Really stupid.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very good game!  I showed this to my 78 year old aunt and she couldn't put it down!  It's a keeper.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!!! It's  very fun and addicting. There's only one problem, and that's that its kinda time consuming, but not so much a waste of time. It really fun, and you'll stay up all night playing it. I'm telling you to get it. Its worth it. :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the first book but this one is my favorite! Can't wait for the movie. Now, on to the next book...
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book started out slow but became very interesting very quickly.  I couldn't put it down when I got to the last four chapters!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Although I have loved this album I wish that I would have bought it as the fame monster double album
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Another excellent read by Lee Child. Recommended to anyone looking for a good fast paced mystery. I love how Jack Reacher figures things out...he's so smart and his patience is definitely a virtue.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I am not even a big Jack Black fan and I have fallen in love with this movie.  I have see it too many times already and I can't wait to see it again.  It is so well written and we'll voiced over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me intrigued the entire time, and I couldn't put it down after getting half way through. Definitely worth the read. Great price too!
B005TZFZ7E|5.0|This is my personal opinion the best album that Rihanna has. There are a few trashy and poorly written songs but it is definitely worth purchasing.
B001AQR3MQ|3.0|We saw this movie when it first came out and loved it. So when time went by, we thought we would get the blu-ray version for our 65&#34; flat screen and audio system and sit back and enjoy it. But we didn't. Things change over time, maybe our thinking or the way we re-act to something, but to us, this movie lost it's appeal. It's still an interesting story line done by a very creative writer, but for us what fit then doesn't fit now. Still. first time viewers may love it. People I've talked to either 'got' this movie and think it's the movie popcorn was invented for; or people didn't 'get it' and hated it. To each his own.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|What an album,  there is so much music.  Some of the songs are a bit out there but nothing that you would not expect from Gaga.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I don't know why there are so many bad reviews! I loved it thoroughly. Only took me a few hours to get through. The romance was butterflies-in-your-stomach good.
B00192IV0O|4.0|Everyone already knows exactly what is on this album, it is nice to listen to every now and then especially because some of the tracks like boom boom pow were so over played. The tracks that people are less familiar with are good.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|ok game it is good till level 12 when most of the board clouds over and you can not see most of the game board
B0046MVVOW|5.0|This is great because I hadn't bought either of the albums separately. Other wise it would have been frustrating. It's a good fun album.
B0041D843M|5.0|Everyone who believes that animal proteins are the most effective way for humans to obtain the body's protein requirement would benefit from reading this book.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|There is no reason to have a review section to this move. It is so well done and the music is great, and what a great deal with blu-ray becoming more and more popular.
B008IEFP1E|4.0|Not as good as songs about Jane but I still love it nonetheless!  One of my favorite bands!  I love the song wasted years!
1451695195|5.0|This is by far the most important book that I think anyone could read.  This gives so much insight into the world today and why things happen the way they do.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|If you live the movie or even just somewhat enjoyed the move, this is a great album for any collection.  And daft punk is great. If you did not like the movie but you enjoy the music that Daft Punk does then get the Remix album.

B007SGM084|5.0|Something different with interesting storyline.  Second and third book even better. Well written, even though all the lovemaking can become a bit to much!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is definitely not the pc version!! All of you who give carp to this because it isn't pc version it is still a lot of fun! I love building and fighting but don't prefer mining. I recommend this game!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was looking for a free word processor that allowed you to edit. Unfortunately I could not find one. Evermore might not be a word processor but I love it any way. I write chapter outline for my stories, the first draft of poems, and notes on various other things. I have the first gen kindle so I can't take pictures and there is no mic but if it did I am sure I would use evermore to its full potential.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The suspense was incredible. Every sentence had me gripping the book tighter, just to find out what was going to happen. Love it, love it, love!!!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|An excellent albumn to get us into the Christmas spirit. Rod Stewart has staying power and has transformed himself into a timeless crooner!
B004ZN9RWK|4.0|Did not know there would would not be a hard case based on ad. CD is in great shape. Awesome sounds!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I am a huge fan and I didn't think it possible to beat season 1, but they did it! The cast was exceptional in their new roles, it was fascinating to see each actor capture a completely new character! On top of all that, it was scary- five star psychological thriller, just awesome!
B008476HBM|5.0|Very well written love story and an interesting study of human nature. Probably of more interest to women than men.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I do not get the negative reviews.  5 Batteries delivered for less than $2.  My garage door remote now works.  And people are crying about low battery life?  Maybe they open and close their garage doors 100 times a day for the excitement.  I guess some people just have to complain about something.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved it when I saw it in the theater; loved it even more on the second viewing (the DVD).  Great movie, especially for those of us of a &#34;certain age.&#34;

B008673ZAQ|5.0|A real page turner!  I finished the book within two days it was so good!  I'm sure my fiancé appreciated the fact that I read it too....lol
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Love it!  All the old greats are here.  I have this both on my Kindle Fire and also on the desktop.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I liked it a lot. Wish it was longer! Can't wait until the 2nd game comes out! U liked how the hints helped you.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|i found the movie to be witty, fun and full of great humor....the family loved it. we hope there is another ice age movie coming
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a very funny book and most kids will enjoy it. Good book and I loved it I hope you will too.  Hailey Stepp.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|This was awful. I was looking forward to a spectacular movie and this was a huge disappointment. Time to close the book on the Batman's made only to fatten wallets in Hollywood. I would rate it less than 1 star if I could.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT-GENERATION.ONE! Def worth reading, I would highly recommend it fo sho
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Great item at a reasonable price, although I wish it came w/ my kindle fire. Very crisp pictures and is easy to use.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!  It was very difficult to put down even from the very beginning.  Get ready to fall in love with these characters.
0061020710|3.0|I sort of enjoyed this book, but not enough to read any more by Pratchett. Although I love fantasy stories, this one was just a bit too out there for me. This is a rather short book and I can recomend it to most anyone to determine whether it is their kind of story so as to, or not, continue on with the many books that follow in this series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it because my family is on facebook and friends. You can review lot of pictures people post and different likes.
1933308087|5.0|This is a very beautiful book, has tons of patterns! I love it! I got a lot of inspiration from it for future quilts!! It comes with a grid so you can see what the blocks in the pattern look like.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The bible is for us to show us how much Jesus loves us. It is a way of life for us.<br /><br />I would recommend it to everyone. It showed me a new way of life in Him! He answers our prayers He is for us not against us.<br /><br />I have read the bible for along time. It will make your life better to know that he Loves us unconditional.
1402770006|5.0|Really a great adaptation of this classic story. The artwork is excellent as always (see also their fantastic adaptation of Lovecraft's \\"At The Mountains of Madness\\") and the colors do so much to add to the mood of the piece, it's really one of the best ways to experience this Doyle masterwork. I have to add one tiny caveat (well, I don't actually have to, but I'm going to anyway): for some odd reason all of the characters have this bizarre cresent-shaped slash drawn across their faces. ALL of the characters. It's distracting, but it doesn't ruin the thing. It's just....weird.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|great app its cool to be able to customize your own and pretty much any photo you can download at a great price also full app its worth worth the money just to check it out
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I'm sure if you read the books first before watching the series you would think the books are better but all in all the first book was just as thrilling as the first season!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked this book because it was adventurous and it was exciting. I would recommend this book to people who like adventures.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great read. The writing flowed and the story riveting! If you liked her other books you will love this one.
075669812X|5.0|My son liked so much. Now my son and I know all about Lego Ninjago, and we can play together.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is a good reminder about the perspective of time in our lives. As always, Mitch Albom, wrote a wonderful book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Some reviewers seem offended by the similarity in characters, but for me that wasn't an issue.  If you are looking for something totally original then you will be disappointed.  People who enjoy the &#34;series&#34; type of books relate to the character and the familiarity more than a unique twist.  I thought this was well written, John Puller was more believable than Jack Reacher, but still larger than life.<br /><br />None of the movies or books based on James Bond type heros are really intended to be realistic, they fulfill a need for escape from every day life and let us live vicariously through characters who are able and willing to the impossible, this book certainly does that!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun and easy game. It is a great one to play to pass some time not so much like the earlier game of the same name but still a lot of fun!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Great book for anyone interested in what may be going on behind the mask which most people present to the world. Particularly loved the inter-generational relationships and what constitutes a &#34;community&#34;.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Love the way this brings everything back. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are always a comic relief.  Must see
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the movie first, read the first book, and have not stopped reading. My granddaughter started me on this, and I could not stop, the books to me were great.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|If you are a Batman fan then this is a must movie.  Christian Bale by far is the best Batman ever.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have always been a fan of puzzle games and this is one of my favorites.  I like the free play mode because it is just relaxing and mezmerizing and I love that on my kindle fire I can get 10x10 and 11x11 grids!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Jeremy Renner did not disappoint.  He fit right in when it comes to the expectations of the Bourne movies.  Left everything open for more.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|After forty years of medical practice, his observations about the secular resistance to this topic ring true; his after death experience rings of grace.  God's.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was the best Hulk.  The characters all added to this movie.  I like the way they let each character have his own identity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Each page kept me wanting to read more and more! A great read for all ages.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An intriguing read, with a thought-provoking premise, well defined characters, and a story that could be prophetic. I can't wait to read more!
B0086213XW|4.0|this movie's under appreciated. i enjoyed the movie with great actings. sarah polley did a good job in telling a simple story with a clear message. a bit of emotions but it allows one to sit down and think a bit on life decisions.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I got this book not expecting an overwhelmingly amazing story, but that's almost what I received. The story of the main character, Vaelin Al Sorna, is a compelling and interesting story that I had a hard time putting down. I felt drawn into the world and the struggles of Vaelin, and by the end of it and I was deeply satisfied with my purchase. I can't wait for the next one to be released.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it...I knew what was happening with Katniss but I liked how it fell into place! Can't wait to start the next one!
B0099114WO|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE I REALLY ENJOYED IT. I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING MY HUSBAND. LOL MY FRIENDS<br />ENJOYED IT ALSO.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought this novel was very well written. Lots of issues brought up that transcend though the story such as politics, a utopian society, violence, retribution. A page turner that makes you wanting more!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE. MY FRIENDS LOVED IT. IT IS A REAL &#34;CHICK FLICK&#34;. LOL I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO<br />ALL LADIES. LOL
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is as good as the TV weather.  I recommend it as part of your apps selection for your moble device.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|...damn game keeps freezing!!! How frustrating can you get??!!!! Thankful didn't have to spend $ on this! Enjoy the fun and frustration at your own risk!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent Bible app to have on your moble device.  Several different Bible translations are available making it an excellent when trying to understand a passage you may be reading.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|t<br />Terrific game with excellent pacing, plenty of intrigue in terms of plot and enough diversion to keep one 's interest for several hours. This review is based on the paid version --which is a bargain considering it's a Collector's Edition with two bonus chapters. Highly recommended
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Heard a lot of people talking about this crazy game and tried it. Sure is fun! I'd recommend it to anyone. Very entertaining!
6304884419|5.0|I bought this for my son, he didnt have this movie so I got it for him to add to his collection.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Anxiously awaiting 2013.  If Horror and the paranormal peak your interest..... DEFINATELY give this one a try. Will keep you on the edge
B00004T9UF|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas, and he loves Eminem and this is one cd he didn't have in his collection.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I have downloaded many game apps that just do not show on my android tablet!  I have a Kindle app which is supposed to play them, but where are they and how do I get them to work?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game, easy to play . love the mini puzzles and the hidden object parts were challenging . enjoyed the story line . it is almost addictive I had trouble putting it down
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the history in this book.  Ken Follette is a great writer. It is long but one becomes so invested in the families, you can't wait to see what happens next.
B009C7JS14|1.0|it didn't get cloes to my town don't bothere buying this app I didn't get to even see my weather<br />l
B004YXE438|5.0|I play on kindle fire h.d. works great no problems . Beautiful pictures, multiple game play. If you love puzzles this is a must play app. You move the blocks around to complete the puzzles. Enjoy the game everyone. =^**^=
0061122416|3.0|In a way this book reminded me of Candide. It was written to speak of a specific philosophy and the entire text seemed to contribute to that. Though it does tell a story of a boy traveling across cities and deserts to find a treasure, at heart it is a story about how we must be true to our own destinies and listen to the land and the signs around us because we are all one.<br /><br />I thought the book to be interesting, and underlined quite a few passages I found to be thought provoking and intriguing. At the same time, the book was simple and at times a little sexist. The characters were flat and I found little significance in the plot itself. What I mean to say, is this book shouldn't be read if you wish to only hear a story. Instead this book is meant to be larger than a succession of events. This book tells of a life philosophy and for that, I think it is worthwhile. I would recommend it.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|What do you expect, you get what you pay for.  Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap
0374214913|3.0|I was really excited for this book. I tend to love anything set in a dimly lit book store with ladders stretching to the ceiling and old men with mysterious glasses and riddles, but unfortunately this wasn't what I had hoped. Sloan attempted to marry that world with technology (Google, eReaders etc.) and I just felt as if it fell short. The book felt slow and the final conclusion didn't seem to work with all the preamble. I appreciated parts of the book, the beginning and the end most specifically, but I found the middle to be a little weighted. It didn't have the magic I hoped for, and I found myself wanting to end some of the characters, specifically \\"Kat\\" the googler and love interest who seemed about as human as a block of stone. With that being said, I appreciated the idea of the book and some parts were funny, and interesting.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The book is about a newly unemployed man who comes to find employment at a 24 hour bookshop (that detail is intriguing all by itself, I'd like to stumble on one of those) owned by Mr. Penumbra, an older man who asks funny questions and makes even more cryptic commands of Clay. He begins to notice strange things about the store, like the odd collection of people who come into the store to borrow from a section that rents old books (which he can't seem to find record of anywhere online) instead of selling them. Eventually he finds out that there is a secret code in those books and embarks on a journey to try and decode it, once and for all.<br /><br />I think perhaps, my judgment of this book may be tainted by my love for pages and spines and my rejection of ereaders and the idea that everything can be solved with a computer, but none-the-less I can't say it was my favorite. Although, I did finish it, and the last page made me smile.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Very funny, unique, and memorable.<br /><br />The characters in this film are sometimes a bit over the top, but that only serves to make them memorable.  Anyone showing up to a costume party dressed as The Dude, or Walter Sobchack, or any of the other major characters for that matter, will be instantly recognizable to anyone who's seen the movie.  This movie is full of memorable quotes and absurd scenes that you will remember for years to come.
B005LAII12|5.0|Look I'll start this by saying if you like &#34;Family Guy&#34; and the antics of Peter Griffin and Seth McFarlane you will love this. Yes the same voice that does Peter does Ted (Seth McFarlane) and there is even a passing joke at the expense of that. But even if you were to approach this as a novice of McFarlanes other work you would appreciate the humour. It's along the same vein as a lot of the Judd Appatow style comedy with a ot of bad language but you hear that anywhere these days so it's no use being too easily offended or else you would never leave home anymore<br />It is a classic buddy movie where both the main characters are dope smoking slackers and content in their rut.<br />Mark Wahlberg's character is great, he is weak unreliable and a total underachiever both at work and in his love of Mila Kunis.<br />Look out for a delightfully offbeat performance by the ever gifted Giovanni Ribisi as a dark and tormented character<br />There is the usual story arc of boy has girl, boy takes girl for granted, boy loses girl, but so much in between that you are hooked.<br />I loved this movie and will be back to watch it again soon.
0761163808|5.0|I saw this book and fell in love with it.  It's for my 2 year old grandson, who will get the biggest kick out of it.
B000SEI230|4.0|It's an amazing Love Story about a rebel that changes his entire way because of one girl he falls in love with, the girl he falls in love with has been through challenges and occurs in one more when Landon (the rebel) is changed and is in love with her, they get married... he never moved on..... Love Nicholas Sparks's writing and  A WALK TO REMEMBER is another amazing book!
B002VT6C0K|5.0|Riveting, unusual stories told in a unique, beautiful style. I couldn't put these stories down.<br />The versatility and creativity of  Alice Munro are amazing, each story usually encompassing an<br />entire life span.
B005XLN97M|5.0|IT IS A BEACH HOUSE... Although it is a nice item (I recommend it) it's small for a girl who has more than two or three barbie dolls...  The house has no space for being 'creative' (add another room hehe). She has been playing with the house since 'Santa&#34; brought it home...!!!
1451695187|5.0|Great book and it's great to have some good reading material for people suffering with terminal disease and to help in possibly alleviating some of the question in one's mind about the proof of heaven, and afterlife.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Love her style of writing. Keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read ahead. Really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Free
B000FC130E|5.0|This is the first Neil Gaiman book for me. I was a bit unsure about the book because I tend to stick to authors I know and like. I mostly enjoy books that are suspense/thriller/fantasy/mythical/historical fiction and even an occasional haunted story. This book meets most of the categories above. Whether you read because of pure boredom or to escape reality, this book will do the job!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book. Might be my favorite book of the series. I give it a 5 star rating. So good.
1449410243|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud at some points. Full color art throughout. Well drawn, especially the expressions and actions of the cats. The bulletin board was one of my favorites, but there are several.<br /><br />I don't really mind swearing, but I did find the number of times God's name was taken in vain to be excessive. There is also a section that gives signs to help you determine if your cat is gay. Because of these, the book may not be a good choice for younger readers.<br /><br />Highly recommended if the above points won't offend you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This will help do my math homework and i could solve many mathh problems and i can now have it in my hands instead for looking for a calculator
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I am not a social science professional, so I am not in a position to evaluate how the author's positions compare to &#34;industry standards&#34;. I do know that her arguments were pusuasive to me based on the mix of personal histories and research findings she presented .<br /> I must admit that, at first, I felt that the author was expending too much ink on extroverts - &#34; Oh those extroverts - they even elbow their way into a book about introverts!&#34; Then I realized that one really can't write about one without the other. While the US bias favoring extroverts is so obvious it required less explaining, I found the US social history - how we arrived at this state - fascinating. I also found the research evaluating sensitivity to stimulus in infants and the follow up interesting and convincing. I also found her point that functioning in groups can be exhausting for introverts instructive and useful.<br />The author's most valuable point to me is that the &#34;introverted way&#34; is just as legitimate approach to living as the prevailing extroverted norm. I was also happy that she included the Asian perspective. I  often have that same reaction and am often reminded of  a saying from my childhood - &#34;Empty barrels make the most noise&#34;. I was also happy that the author included practical advice for introverts and, especially, the parents of introverts. I came away from the book more educated to my own needs, the needs of others and better prepared to communicate with all types.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I think I like it because it lets you learn like if i say zebra I can look it up in the dictionary.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Great Music, Great Costumes, OK with the story line, sad with the way Christine's life was, not the fairytail I would have wished for her
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is terrific, but food is expensive an  gold practically impossible to get. The dragons are all very cool though.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Love the stage performance much better than the movie.  The story, music, costumes, actors are all wonderful.  Love the feel of the stageconsidering the story is about opera performances
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love this movie I cry everytime I watch it. I would recomend it to anyone. It was worth watching.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I recomend this for ages 8and up. I like this game because it keeps a persons mind thinking. I have always liked this game.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This movie I have heard alot about and had to buy to watch for myself. It has Matthew in it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I find this game alittle hard for me. I was never very good at puzzles. This could be a very fun game for alot of people.
B005FISBV2|4.0|I enjoyed sexth season a lot. (SPOILERS BELOW).<br /><br />I thought the plots were good, innovative. Character development also was very good, with Quinn being lost, La Guerta tied to Matthews, Debra as Lieutnatn, Dexter taking care of Harrison, Batista and his sister. Only Vince Masuka I think did not get enough screen time. The new guy from Chicago was also a good addition to the cast.<br /><br />Anyway, I could not miss any show that had Bill Adama in its cast!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I liked the movie very much, I would recomend this for all ages! I seen this advertise on TV and it looked good. I liked the music and the competions!
B006LSZECO|5.0|for a holiday read.....I couldn't put it down!!  4 of us in the house read it at the same time and we all loved it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! I finished it in two days. Once I got caught in the tumultuous relationship and the love story, I was hooked and could not put the book away! I can not wait for the movie to come out! If it is half as entertaining as the book, it will be the movie of the year!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Convenient and user friendly app, particularly when shopping for books and general merchandise.  Good  source for gift and personal shopping,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've never read anything by Nicholas Sparks before, although I have seen some of the movies that have been made from his stories. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, finishing in 3 days. It kept my attention from start to finish. It's a beautiful story about strength, love, and starting over. I will definitely be reading more from him in the future.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Elf is a rediculously funny movie for the holiday season. It's appropriate for the entire family but especially so for persons that can understand innuendo.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it needs more animals like wolves in the compter minecraft and they can put a scary guy in there like heroine!
B00319ECGU|5.0|This is my third (and hopefully final) Dirty Harry collection.  I owned the first and second (special edition) DVD sets, which I gave one to my brother and the other is waiting in queue to be gifted to someone else.  These are films I wanted to own on Blu-ray within my library.  The films (at least a couple of them) are classics, and since there's already been a lot said about them I won't review the film except to say they are Eastwood as his best.  The Blu-ray is a definite upgrade.  I have replaced some titles that are personal favorites and this is one of them.  If you find it on sale, as it is from time to time, pick it up and recycle your DVD sets to a friend or family member.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book ever it's hilarious!!!another great book just like the other diary of a wimpy kid books<br />Totally get the book if you want to laugh so hard
B009POCG2C|3.0|Familiar Hallmark-style drama made palatable by Clint Eastwood's iconic presence and his effortless rapport with Amy Adams. \\"Trouble With the Curve\\" (2012) offers few surprises but remains an agreeable diversion. A disappointment at the box office, this bottom-of-the-ninth Eastwood vehicle works better on the small screen.
B000SEI230|5.0|I am in awe right now. This beautiful book of love, hope, forgiveness, strength and courage as it tales a tale of a young man and his willingness to love despite everything life throws at him. It's a must read and should be on everyone's book lists.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have always looked forward to and enjoyed all of the Pedergast  novels, but I think this one will go down as one of my favorites. The story was unique and kept me interested from start to finish. I would definitely recommend reading it!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|This is not great literature but for those of  us who are connected to our furry friends,<br />it is entertaining and a fairly quick read.
1419705849|5.0|We love these books.  This one is as great as the others.  We love to read all about the adventures.  Mr. Kinney....keep writing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I thought this game was really awesome and love hidden object games so much. great job with this app. would recommend to friends.
0345529057|5.0|A set with the first four books - epic fantasy, great characters and a very interesting world. I love Game of Thrones!<br />After watching the TVseries, I really wanted to read the books. So, said and done - the books are now in my possession! :) I encurage most people to read these, they might be a bit complicated - one must have some patience and keep on reading. Also be able to keep a track/memory of a lot of characters. Other than that, awesome story!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This fast paced game is a challenger!! You have to fill a grid (5x5, 8x8, 9x9) completely by connecting two same color dots. However... the catch is to not intersect any other color! Very addicting game! I would highly recommend this game to anyone of any age! Just a great brain teaser game that will keep you entertained for hours!!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Helpful for the person who is having a hard time to find just the right explanation for his questions and ideas.
0679746048|5.0|This memoir is a stunning tale of Susanna Kason, who undergoes a breakdown and checks herself into a hospital ward in the 1960s. Told directly through the eyes of Kason, it is a fascinating view of the world in the 60s! After seeing the movie, I became fascinated with the story and was so happy to see she wrote a memoir! It really offers a first hand account through the eyes of a patient in the time of the 60s and all the changes happening while suffering from a mental illness, primarily around \\"borderline personality disorder.\\" You go with Kason throughout the novel, experiencing the ups and downs of recovery and her interactions with others in the ward, including Lisa, a sociopath who is also in recovery. A stunning read! I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoyed the movie or simply wants to learn more about the Borderline Personality Disorder or simply is looking for a good read.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its fun but not fast it keeps.messing up. I try to see a friends village and it sometimes works...... but......it will not usually load and I usually have to restart my device again and it sometimes wont even do that.so if you don't mind it needing up your device then get it p.s.

B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I have this application and use it every day. It is easy but not perfect for looking up medical words
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does what I need it to do. Very easy to use on my kindle fire.  Just what I needed.
B007THA4FI|5.0|So different from Harry Potter but an interesting essay on poverty and people's attitudes towards it.  Wonder if the understanding of its complexity comes from Rowling own experiences.
B005JR4K28|5.0|this was my favorite christmas gift and it will be the best gift that keeps on giving laughs and a need for more seasons soon
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Think I would have loved this as I loved the books but tried many times in the 24 hours I had rented it and could never download it.  So I am out $3.99.  Don't know if I have any options to get my money back or better yet be able to watch the movie.  Hesitant to rent another too if I will just lose my money.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When it was plugged into the wall it provided a charge to the battery inside of the kinle fire. This made my daughter happy.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|A good read and a must to start Baldacci's Camel Club series.  An enjoyable cast of characters with a well developed plot.
B000066C6F|5.0|This is another movie from the past I was having trouble finding in the store. Good movie if you like Travolta and/or Jamie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A great read, and finish to exciting & suspenseful story! I'm sorry that it is over.  If movies are made, I hope they do the story justice!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This is an excellent movie all by itself, but add the collector's edition extra's and it's really a find.  I love this movie and recommend it to any adult and I think it's a good date movie....guys should enjoy it, too.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|SHE WAS THRILLED WITH HER GIFT FROM SANTA, IT WAS<br />ADDED IT TO HER COLLECTION OF OTHERS PURCHASED ON AMAZON
B00004WG2F|5.0|The item arrived quickly and was well packaged and in great condition!  Thank you for giving me a gift I could not locate in a store and in such good condition.  The item was a gift and loved by the recipient.  I will buy from this seller again for sure!  Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All I can say is I loved the book. I watched the movie before I read the book, but the book filled in information that wasn't received in the movie. This is a great read!
0790733226|5.0|This was another movie I had trouble finding in a store and wanted to add to my collection. I like the thought provoking ideas it promotes and while Jodie is the headliner, Matthew McConaughey plays a wonderful role.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I got the app then when it said it was downloading the bar didn't fill. any ideas on what to do.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This is another hard to find in the store Andrew McCarthy movie that just is good for the soul. Lots of fun and laughter with a happy ending.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, it was entertaining but it is definitely a movie you have to pay attention to or you will get lost.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This makes it incredibly easy to view my You Tube content when I am away from home, or when others in my household are busy on my PC! Love it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|love this movie it was very entertaining and had good graphic quality through out the entire movie. would watch again
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love this game, but really got it because my grandchildren play it and I was curious. It's fun, although a bit frustrating which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|batman never lets you down in one of his movies. enjoy the whole way through. not exactly what I expected but still loved it
B008NR1AJW|5.0|This little &#34;Black Book&#34;, steals up on you and makes every doubt you ever had about your art  and reduces  it to a pile of nothing. Just what you need when uncertainty enters your brain and begins to drain you intuitive creativity away.  This book can be read in an hour and because of it's format you can skip around and revisit the passages that made the most impact on you.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Was skeptical at first if this one would hold my interest for long,but it's hard to put down!Very challenging levels the deeper you get,trying to get &quot;perfect&quot;on every level is a real mind bender.The music is enjoyable to listen to while playing,it actually deepens my thought process.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story consumed me... I couldn't wait until the next time I was able to read it.  It had me laughing, furious and sad all in one page...
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Well, I think it was a blast! The songs were great! The actors really fit their parts! The only downfall was it was a bit drawn out - could have ended it about 20 minutes earlier for a really awesome length movie (for what it was intended to be). Clearly, this movie is for those who want entertainment - NOT a thinking movie or something other than pure fun! I really enjoyed it! B+ at least! If you love the 80s and rock-n-roll, you'll love it :)<br />Great fun, Tom Cruise, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin - hilarious!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A heart wrenching story of kidnapping and abuse of a little girl and the power to overcome and go on as an adult.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|Good price for a good Christmas movie.  Our kids had never seen the movie and they enjoyed it as well.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|Nothing special. As always, Streep does an outstanding job getting in character. It wants me to write more word s.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Have you ever considered how rare a mother is in a Disney animated film? Usually there is no mother or she is killed off quickly. This story might explain why because the teen's wish is that her mother would change so she could be free to become the woman she desires. She gets her wish by placing her mother in danger. This movie gets so much about teens right, including the normal self-absorption, lack of responsibility and wild pendulum swings between child and woman. The story encourages parents to nurture their daughter's strengths, not just their traditions. The girl's hair is practically a character in its own right so much time is spent on its rendering, just as it is in most teen girl's lives.<br /><br />If you're of Celtic background this will be a particular delight. There are stereotypes of Celtic behavior, but how do you ground a cultural story without them?<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Needed a player to play my avi files. Make sure you change settings to soft decode or you won't have any sound.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Funny, appropriate, highly recommend! We kept the Blu-ray for ourselves, and we let our friends borrow the DVD. Watch it to find out if you are a man or muppet!
B0015XASFS|5.0|I love it..<br />He is just fantastic. I will be buy more for you. Keep up the good work, everything arrives on time..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Do not pass go, do not collect $100. BUY THIS BOOK NOW! I read this in less than 48 hours, I could not put it down. By far one of the most well written, captivating books in years. Not many can write about such highly sensitive subject matter while still having such a passionate romance.  Colleen Hoover nails it, and she does it with such grace and eloquence. Love, love, love this!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love all of the Mahjong games..some are a little easy but on the whole its very addicting...love it keep up the good work
B003MC5N28|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. My mom hated the ending but I have to admit that the ending was great how you added the suspense to it was amazing!
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|very hard to navigate around..could not find any word that I was trying to find...very unhappy...I like to play scrabble.so I got very frustrated. closed it up and going to dump the app. sorry
B0042C1BP0|3.0|Seems like the plot was just thrown together, not very interesting at all. The action kept my attention but I will say, I really miss all the gadgets that Bond would employ in earlier movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love being able to sit on my comfy couch &amp; &quot;dream&quot; with my Pinterest on my favorite. Christmas present my kindle fire.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  A great read with lots of twists and turns and unexpected truths....  a great read
B0045KCD10|2.0|Cinematography was excellent as was the acting.  I didn't think the story line was that interesting, though.  Maybe the villain's character should have been better developed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've been a Clancy reader since Red Storm Rising and Hunt for Red October. It used to be I'd have his hard cover books on the day of release. It seemed he sold out in the past few years and his last novel was horrible. I was skeptical but purchased Threat Vector anyhow.<br />It reads like classic Clancy, bringing together numerous seemingly unrelated scenarios that all sync up. I had trouble putting it down, it held my attention. I hope he continues in this style.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book took a while to get going but once it did like the other two it was amazing! I loved the ending and it didn't leave any question unanswered. A great way to end the trilogy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I recommend this game if you have kids. the game gets boring if you run out of coins. have fun!
B000LTAY1U|4.0|this watch is a wonderful product and i like it.  Having said that I do not care for it for me personally.  I have<br />large hands and the watch face seemed to small for my liking.  Call it personal preference but i like a watch<br />with a larger face.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I read the book because of the many mentions I'd seen in Top 10 lists and the high reviews on Amazon.  I have to say I thought it was just \\"ok\\".  The main characters of Hazel and Augustus came across as characters written by an adult male, which they were.  The believability factor of the way the characters were written just seemed off.  It came across like an 80's movie where the teenagers are geniuses and the adults are one-dimensional Simpletons.  The ever-present looming death of the main characters hung on each page to the point that you became numb to the emotions it was supposed to invoke.  I'm happy that so many others were moved and loved the book so much, but for me, it disingenuously tried too hard.
0920668372|5.0|Perfect gift for anyone with young children! I purchased several books to give as Christmas gifts this year! I love this story!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was an amazing story,  I loved every page!  Sad that it was over so quickly.  Another story could be written about their life together.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I chose Dark Shadows because I wondered how the story would be interpreted in 2012. I had been intrigued by the TV series when I was young. I thought it would be dopy and silly, but it was creepily fun and funny instead. I loved it. I have recommended it to friends.
0812550706|2.0|It's not a terrible book, but it left me wholly uninspired. The book's short length happened to be the only result of my bother to achieve the all-too-obvious ending which i had predicted not even half way in. A child prodigy chess-player is just as lame in a futuristic (video-game) setting as it is in real life.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I scored on this entire album!  I bought it before Christmas for 99 cents and was extremely satisfied.  I had been looking for this album on half and kept watching but when I happened to find Amazon offered it for such a low price.  I love, love, love Amazon!
B008S4FZHI|4.0|Very enjoyable, I didn't like her other more recent books, this is more like her earlier books that she used to write.
B0090OW7J4|4.0|If you like John Hiatt then you will like this CD. His voice can get to you alittle sometimes but I listen to learn - he's has very original material and he's still a master at writing songs.
B008ENA74E|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Interesting humanistic and business story. I would recommend for finance majors in college as it gives you an inside view of what working on Wall street is really like and the ethical dilemmas you may be faced with in the business world.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I bought &#34;Ceremonials&#34; a couple of months before, and this CD was even better at showcasing a major new pop talent!!
0553801473|5.0|This whole book feels like a massive prologue. I admit that it is very bloated and very dense, but when you finish reading it you feel like a god. All other books seem like pamphlets from the local tourist office. I loved Dance as well as a feast for crows and It saddens me that people don't appreciate Martin's incredible ability to weave such an intricate story as this.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|An excellent collection displaying a superior talent.  This CD inspired me to look into other CDs by this talented new artist.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|why does require I write a long review. This is why I don't like giving them. I like the stars lets keep it that way.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was recently introduced to pintrest and I absolutely love.it!  this.is my first time ever.rating an app so that says something!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love this movie.  It arrived quickly and was in perfect condition.  I do not buy movies often so I did think the price was a little high.  But I just had to have this movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger is 100% better than the original charger that came with my kindle fire. Plus the cord is super long!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you are buying the series i'm sure you've read Harry Potter or seen the movies. This is the straight movie set, no bonus features. However the way it compacts them all into one cool snap case makes me love it more! I am all about neat and organized. This is a great addition to any collection!
B0051CSI0G|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />\\"Stake Land\\" plays like an apocalyptic Zombie film with Vampires instead. That being said, the Vampires in this film are but Zombies with Vampire physical traits, & even that is minimal, with no supernatural shape shifting abilities, though their make up is effectively feral in appearance. Their mental capacity is about Zombie level, though they have evolved in to two types of Vampires, with one stronger & harder to kill than the other. It appears they may be evolving more, which is an interesting idea, but it is a thin line to hang a whole film on. Now most of what I've wrote so far, really doesn't sound to interesting, or original, but this is only one aspect of the plot...<br /><br />\\"Stake Land\\" is a chameleon. Yes, it's an apocalyptic Zombie like, Vampire film, but it's also plays out like a western, especially a bounty hunter western. It is a road movie. It is a film that makes statements about how the human race will become fragmented, becoming just as much of a menace to it's self as the Vampires are, with fanatical religious groups, in this case extremist Christians, taking the appearance of Vampires as a sign of God's wrath, & feeding the non-believers to the Vampires as a sacrifice to God. It also taps into the male domination of women through religion, though it takes this premise to extremes, it is also conceivable that these things could & would happen with religious male extremists. So here's a little more fuel to the fire. Still, it's been done before, though...<br /><br />The thing that makes \\"Stake Land\\" a great little film as opposed to a mediocre been there, done that film, is it's great acting, script, direction, & personal characters plot line interaction. Yes, this is an apocalyptic film, but seen at the very personal level of two characters, teenager \\"Martin,\\" whose family was destroyed by Vampires, & \\"Mister,\\" ( who reminds me of the Troll Hunter in \\"Troll Hunter\\") who saves his life & teaches him to be a Vampire hunter. There is a real relationship here, as \\"Mister\\" becomes a surrogate father figure to Martin, & as gruff & grizzled as Mister is, there are moments that shows his love of Martin, like a son. The two go on their journey meeting & helping other people, actually building strong relationships with these people, who are struggling against the Vampires & the religious extremists. These relationships are quite real, & touching. You get to know these characters. You get to care about these characters, & that is this film's saving grace, even though as preposterous a setting as Vampires taking over the world is, \\"Stake Land\\" remains a very human film, about human relationships, with all the love & hate that goes with human relationships. This makes \\"Stake Land\\" much deeper than most of it's sub-genre ilk. In a way, this makes \\"Stake Land\\" the Vampire equivalent to \\"\\"28 Days Later\\" & \\"28 Weeks Later.\\" It gives you people to care about as those films did. It is no where as groundbreaking as those films, but in the end, it's those little everyday relationships we have, that make life & this movie, worth while.hunter.

B009JBZH54|3.0|I chose this rating because the blu ray discs wouldn't always &#34;load&#34; properly. I had to remove them from the player multiple times before they ever worked. Could be poor quality discs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I am ready for book 3 and cannot wait for catching fire to come out in theatres.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I was planning on buying all new movies as blue ray and when this set came out i was super excited, especially for the sale price. All 3 movies for the price of one. I wasnt expecting the box case to be so nice. It also came with a book about all three movies and their characters. If you love the series and need an upgrade like i did buy this
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Book is great, but it's annoying that the table of contents and cover image are missing pages in the kindle edition.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|Bought this for our children, im 26 and still love watching this movie. My only complaint is the blu ray has an extra scene counter but often skips those parts of the movie not sure why, maybe its just our blu ray player messing up and not the actual movie. Has a few extra special features that are funny, like a blooper reel.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|My dad has been wanting this movie for a long time and he loved it!  The DVD got here in record time.  Thanks for the great service.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I watch a lot of those &#34;stupid funny&#34; movies and didnt have high expecations for this one, but this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I didn't laugh much at all and i have a great sense of humor even a dirty sense of humor at times. But watching this i couldnt wait for it to be over but since i paid for the rental i had to finish it all the way thru. It also didn't help that seth mcfarlene did the same voice as peter griffin, i like family guy and the voice should have been totally different.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really enjoy this app. I like the timer feature, I set it for however long I need the noise for and fall asleep. I do wish it had more options, though I did get the free version, so no complaints.
B006CHML4I|1.0|It broke the same night I received it.  the Stem came out.  Not like the original Seiko watches I remember
0345541588|3.0|This was the first Lee Child book I've read, and I'm not sure there will be another. It started off with a bang, but as the book progressed the story line for me became more and more unbelievable. Suddenly I'm looking up and wondering how we got to the point where the characters were shooting gurellia tranquilizer into each other. And how Reacher figured out the case at the end was totally unbelievable. So all in all, it was just ok with me. Hopefully there are better Reacher novels out there.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I decided to start reading the books after I watched the first Season of the TV show on HBO! Since the book is always better right?<br /><br />First book didn't have very many differences from the TV show, However I'm only 1/2 way done with this one and it's had added content that was not in the Second TV series tells the tale more in depth so to speak!<br /><br />i would highly recommend this book to anyone
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Darn this game keeps my husband and I up, late at night playing it in bed!!<br />We are losing a lot of sleep!!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|My 13-year-old loved this gift.  We played and played and played without tiring of it at all!  So easy to learn and fun to play.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book.  It is a good story, the characters are well developed.  I wld recommend it if you are an Austen fan.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Connelly never lets me down, Harry B goes from stenght to strenght.<br />From start to finish the plot is plausible and full of realism.
0823003590|5.0|This is a comprehensive book on one of the most difficult drawing subjects, the head.  Beautifully illustrated, easy to work from, it's a wonderful guide.
B009329Y30|5.0|This download was great quality and I would recommend it to others.<br /><br />The story itself was touching and one that I could watch over and over again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You feel the emotions right along with the characters. Beautifully written and bright tears numerous times both happy and sad.
B008VBYN80|4.0|seems like a good game. could work a bit quicker but I guess with a time based game it isn't bad
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game has a great story line with beautiful graphics. The free trial is amazing and I have blnot bought the game yet but I will because it is a very original hidden object game.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I originally ordered when I had trouble finding on TV / Cable.  Now shown more often on TV.  Not a classic film but is good if you have an interest in birding.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ah it's a good old subterranean hijinx novel.  What's up is what's down in this throwback to yesteryear. And yet,also luminescent in certain ways of our modern apocalyptic society.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book doesn't have as much action as the other books but it does fill the need of meaning in the series.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I liked this movie a lot.  I thought Meryl Streep did an excellent job, as she always does; and Tommy Lee Jones was great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. The title of this book is hopeless but if there is one thing this book will make you feel, it is hopeful. In spite of what you experience in life, know the possibilities of how you choose to face tomorrow, are endless. This story, in all its tragedy was beautiful. Read it, for your own good.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|angry bitrds space is hours of fun,hard to stop playing love it love it,it is a good changle thank you
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was Amazing! INSPIRING to all! It's a very mature book. To truly understand the meanings in this book you have  to be a filter not a sponge!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I finally understand the point of Pinterest! Now I love it. I prefer it on my Kindle Fire for the coziness. Thanks!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another great read from Nicholas Sparks. Always love a great love story and he tells them so wonderfully, you feel like it is real.
B004UID2LC|4.0|For some reason, I cannot get the adobe viewer to load on my kindle fire so this is a good way to see various videos.  It is a little cumbersome but is not bad to use.

B003L77G8I|5.0|This series never disappoints.  Each season is a little different and as it evolves it gains more plot lines and interactions between the characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was one of the best books I read in a while, the emotions were so real.
0545265355|5.0|great books. Bought for my niece. She loves them and the quality of the books is amazing for the low price
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This DropBox is the best program I have ever downloaded....I set it up for my computer and cell and then I added my husband's cell and laptop and when I have a shopping need, it syncs to all of the technologies  immediately. We add in notes and when he has gone to different locations for work, I can send him missing notes and reminders (saves on nagging) and best of all it is FREE.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|I couldn't get enough of this book. The love scenes were AWESOME and tastefully done. I can't wait for the follow up. Keep it coming Ms. Day!
0142413860|5.0|My children always loved this book, so I bought it for my grandsons. I was delighted to find that it came with a CD so that the children can listen on their own when their parents are busy. (When mine were little, I made my own audio tapes of their favorite books for them to listen to on long car trips).
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this story several times. I couldn’t put this book down. I read it all at once. I just didn’t want it to end. I cannot wait to read the story from Travis’s point of view.
030771652X|2.0|Usually within the first 50 pages of a novel, I become totally involved. With &#34;Sister&#34; at p125, the read remains ho-hum. And the book has laid on a table without even a slight yearning to pick it up from me. I'll keep trying, because you never know [unless an attempt is made] how fabulous the story might end up to be.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Terrible. I am so glad that I didn’t pay for this book. Another book that I was waiting for something to happen and it never did. Terrible love seen. Terrible all around.
8120305965|3.0|The stuff designed thirty five years ago was intended to last longer than just until the next model.  My old 1979 Heathkit computer is still running and expanding.  This is a tool needed to get the job done.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It has been a tradition for me to read this Christmas classic every year. I have a nice printed edition I usually read. I found this illustrated Kindle version and it is a very nice version. The illustrations were a nice addition to the Kindle version.
B000I3UAJ0|2.0|What a disappointment.  Half of the movie is grandiose views of the new ship.  A quarter of it is psychedelic views of V'Ger innards.  The rest is a lame plot warm-over of \\"The Changeling\\" (Nomad).  A major disappointment to a major Trekkie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book will appeal to the open-minded professionals who have a spiritual faith but yet find themselves balancing the fine line of science and religion without seeming fanatical or closed minded.  Dr. Alexander does a great job at keeping you interested in the story from start to finish.  The story is unique, sad and beautiful all in one.  But mostly reassuring in the sense that if you so choose to believe then maybe there is something third in line that follows life after death. It's definitely a book worth reading for anyone who is in need of a little faith in their lives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this..very fun.. i allways seem to go back to this game...love it<br />my grandkids love it too.its free thats allways good. try it ull like it
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I did not know what to expect when reading this book. I love all the examples it gave. I have been applying it everyday as much as i can. Everything is so true when used. It has changed the way i view everything. I am just starting to read the magic and it is great as well.
B005CK76ZA|3.0|The discs are awesome, but there is nothing in the thing. The least they could include is a booklet or a lyrics sheet.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|Luv the gsme, need to mske better. Need to be able to take notes. After notes are available, then i will give a 5 star rating. Thank you.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have been reading Lee Child for about a year and have enjoyed each one. This one ended a little different. I really enjoy his style of writing..<br /><br />....
B009O2XY12|3.0|The game is a lot of fun to play, but if you don't clear the board once to often you have to recharge. You then you have the option to wait for it to recharge-I believe 4-5 hrs will provide 5 more chances, and if you play well and clear board it will not be an issue,- or you can purchase more, that could really add up if you're mediocre and simply playing for entertainment.  I got the free one so maybe if I'd purchased I wouldn't experience this continual delay in playing.<br />As far as the game itself, its challenging, fun and would be very enjoyable if not for the potential cost glitch if one were impatient.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|5 Stars for Susan Tedeschi and 2 Stars for the Trucks Band. Susan is a joy to listen to. On Everybody's Talkin' CDs the band bounces between very good to very bad. \\"Midnight in Harlem,\\" during the last two minutes, sounds like the lead guitar amplifier blew a speaker! What was that screech? The guitar solo totally ruined the song. \\"Darling Be Home Soon\\" is the only saving song on these two CDs thanks to Susan T. This song was again almost ruined by the ending guitar solo, but Susan saved it. Interesting that the sound of this one song (Darling Be Home Soon) seems amplified more than the others.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accuweather, is really pretty accurate! There are sometimes that it can be off with things but not too far off. It's a good app, and i like it better than the weather channel, that was not accurate at all!
B00846REIS|4.0|I'm liking this series.  I'm on the second one now.  It's pretty much just sex, and sex, and sex, with damaged people.  A LOT like the Fifty Shades books.  Why on earth am I reading these?  Well, they are fun!
B001DHXT20|5.0|I got this for my son for Christmas also, it works well and he loves the incredible hulk, and the price was decent also for a dvd. Going to a store and shopping on here, you don't realize how much money you save until you do!
B0091REZMW|4.0|nice game..I enjoy playing the game.  I may have to recommend. this game to a friend.  A little small to see sometimes.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Had heard about Joe Bonamassa from a friend so I got on line and listened to a couple of his songs.  Sounded pretty good so I ordered this CD and have become a fan of his.  Plan on getting more of his CD's. He is really good.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is a beautiful book, an uplifting story,a heartwarming tribute.  If you have faith, run from faith, or are trying to run toward faith reading this is a necessary stop on your journey.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I picked one on e bay auction last year just to see what this gizmo can do.  It is simple, well built and it does the job.  Now, many \\"experts\\" have rated this turntable as downright cheap, bad design that will eventually ruin your records. The rants about \\"bad ceramic cartridge\\" that is \\"too heavy\\" was on top of common complaints and \\"unsuitability\\" of this record player. Having a nice and expensive moving magnet or moving coil turntable with adjustable pitch and other perks is a dream of any vinyl lover. However, this turntable will be nice addition to your old Fisher or Scott rack stereo system where the original turntable is either broken or missing ...<br /><br />Although I wasn't happy with the software package that directly creates mp3s, there are other tests I conducted and here are the results:<br /><br />Tone arm weight:  set at 3.4 grams and suitable for just about any micro-groove record that's available today<br /><br />Cartridge and the needle:  Needle does have plenty of \\"play\\", it is not stiff. it is a saphire needle so it will wear faster than diamond needle.  Replacements are dirt cheap - I bought a brand new needle for $2. The needle angle is almost perfect, 0.21 degrees offset when sitting into the record groove.  Mind you, these features are fixed and there's no possibility for further adjustment. It just gives you an idea that the engineering of these sensitive parameters was done with great care!<br /><br />Antiscating:  Oh boy & wow! Even though there are no adjustments, the antiscating holds perfectly no matter where the tone arm is: beginning, middle or the end.  (I used a \\"blank\\" record for this test, meaning there are no grooves, just a shiny surface.)<br /><br />Signal level:  2.4 volts, enough to feed directly into any commercially available home stereo amplifier.<br />EQ: high and mid range excellent, bass little too low, but still very enjoyable sound.<br /><br />Pitch:  33 rpm = 33.4  45 rpm  = 45.4  little off, but not critical formost applications.<br /><br />Although this turntable is built around preset mechanical and electronic values and none of them can be changed or modified, this is a very good product with a very good sound!  However, if you are to plug it into your computer via RCA plugs (or adequate adapters), a ceramic phono cartridge preamp with variable gain is a must.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really just felt good to read you know? The characters feel incredibly real, and you feel like you might actually meet them. This is a good book to pick up, unless you absolutely hate romance. Then you probably shouldn't be looking at this book.
B0044WSF5M|5.0|This is George Lucas keeping it real. I read a column in the newspaper paying homage to this movie for it's soundtrack. Never, I repeat never, will a movie contain a repertoire of classic songs without breaking the film production bank. Talent meets opportunity for Lucas here. This film hallmarks a time period where choices have great value. Enjoy the movie and savor the cars!
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Simply Epic!  This is what the dark knight rises should have been... Nothing bad to say about this movie/cartoon.  If they ever reboot the Batman series hopefully this is what they get from it..
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I have heard and read many raving reviews about the LifeProof Case but you really don't know how well it works until that ever so looming accident happens.  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and the not so bad accident happened.  All she did was drop it (not a big drop but a drop from standing position) and it cracked the case.  A piece of the case by the charger cover broke off.  I  have never heard of anyone having this kind if problem.  I am in the process of seeing if I can get it exchanged.  I will come back and update review once I am done with talking with customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I have returned the LifeProof Case.  Not sure what happened but this case was falling all apart, nearly like it was dry rotted and it would crack if you looked at it wrong.  I will purchase another case but not from this seller.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|Love this collection...the selection of songs is perfect and the sound quality is excellent!  Love the amazon cloud...no interruptions at all!
B002VPE1WK|1.0|I just have bought the backpack 1 month, but now it has proven itself that it cannot hold a SLR and 2 lens !! I really do not recommend this backpack.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love this book. Its not as descriptive as Lord of the Rings which works for me. I could not put it down and am already on to the second book.
1934030597|5.0|Very complete guide, i also recomend Road Bike Maintenance.......This series are great, very helpful and clear, i give it 5 stars...
B0063IYR4I|5.0|This is an excellent for guided meditation.  It allows the user to customize the timing and breathing.  This works very well. I definitely recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thanksfor a great read.So original and the characters were fully developed;Loved the science fiction that related to what could happen.Kudos to Collins.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|So much fun and exciting. Get this. You will be sure to enjoy playing and discovering  all kinds of cool and interesting things. You won't regret diwbliadingthis app.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.l rated this book four because of how funny it was.l recommend this for 6+.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A compelling story about how a German Ace decided to let a B-17 crew escape from destruction. A story of honor, compassion, and mercy within a backdrop of death and devastation during the WW2 air war.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So creepy with the whispers in your ear I strongly recommend this game for u to play it is worth buying
B0099114WO|5.0|This is an excellent movie about a couple married for 31 years that have lost the companionship and love in their marriage.  Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) are the perfect actors to play the couple because you can sense the attraction between them but also the frustration of their relationship.  Kay makes an appointment with a marriage counselor who specializes in intense marriage counseling and Arnold refuses to go but finally shows up.....<br /><br />This is an excellent movie about a married couple trying to restart the passion and love that brought them together in the first place.  The acting was superb and the storyline was well written as it had laughs and sad parts.  It is well worth watching and who knows, it may rekindle your marriage or at least make you look at how you and your wife treat each other.<br /><br />This is a very good film and I recommend it to you as worthwhile to watch for newlyweds to those who have been married for 50 years.  You might learn a life lesson out of the story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfurs is an awesome game! its awesome that u can surf on the subways and it spells stuff like happy new year!
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Poorly acted, written and plotted.  Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just \\"phoned it in\\".  Worst movie I've seen in a long time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is totally worth the money.I have fun with this all the time!I have made tons a unique hairstyles that are really awesome thanks to this app.I would suggest this to the creative people out there.It's really fun!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I thought this was an excellent read from a fantastic author. I so enjoyed how J.K. Rowling took the mundane lives of a small town community and made them so interesting. Each character has a depth to them that is both real and heartbreaking. There is such a rawness to the characters of Pagford that most authors normally don't show. I highly recommend this book.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|We were thoroughly entertained by this delightful romantic comedy.  The movie kept the attention of my wife, who has early onset Alzheimer's, and that is not an easy thing to do.  I am a tech type, but more than once, a sequence would bring a tear (or two) to my eye.  I even enjoyed some of the outtakes, which I usually avoid like the plague!  Look for the one near the beginng of the end credits, where the doctor is leaving the side of the recently deceased Robert DeNiro.  He gives a look of disaproval to the nurse as he reaches for the patient's chart to record the time of death...  and then:<br />I wont spoil it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was difficult putting this book down. It was worth every second of my time! I hated but fell in love with all the characters.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Excellent flash for your D60. Has nice rotation in the light unit and snaps on quickly. Would happily purchase again.
B0002ZMIU8|5.0|Sacha early in his career and in my opinion at his best as a Hip-Hop style gangbanger from a middle-class London suburb. The man is a complete idiot and worth the watch. Also, check out The Hobbit star in an early movie role as his partner.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this game is great. I'm a teenager and I love it! That tells you that it's good! Haha so you should totally get this game!
B0068LYEHA|3.0|Caitlin Moran wants to argue in favour of feminism (or at least her take on it), help young women to learn how to be a woman (often learning from Moran's own mistakes), and to introduce humour and satire into the mix. Moran was 35 years old when she wrote this book, at a stage in her life when she had overcome the insecurities of adolescence and the booze-fuelled soul searching of her twenties, but still young enough to empathise with young women undergoing those rites of passage.<br /><br />The first ten chapters cover the transition through puberty and teenage to the stage of being a `grown up'. She deals with the onset of menstruation, the discovery of masturbation, the anguish of dealing with the physical changes as one heads towards adulthood, and how to deal with relationships. In the fourth chapter she introduces feminism and says that all women should identify as feminist. But there is a good deal of confusion about what this means. At one point she says men should be feminists too, but then says that to be a feminist you need to have a vagina and want to be in charge of it. It's a nice sound bite, but what does it really mean? The question is ignored as we skip to another topic.<br /><br />In a later chapter she says that sexism has to be re-framed as behaviour that separates people into `winners' and `losers', pointing out that women are usually seen as `losers'. To challenge sexism we have to ask: is this behaviour polite? If it's not, then it's sexist and we should reject it. Frankly I found this silly. If we were all just polite to each other, sexism would disappear? The class system in Britain thrives on an ethic of `politeness' and uses this to thwart challenges to the status quo. Is this what Moran really wants? I had visions of Tony Blair and his ridiculous `respect' slogan as I read the chapter.<br /><br />The chapters on pornography and fashion, and on what to do about body hair, raise some complex issues but nothing is considered in any detail. Ultimately there are no driving principles that might help a reader get a grip on womanhood. Moran is against removing pubic hair but has no qualms about shaving armpits or waxing legs. The reason for the former is that the fashion is driven, she says, by pornographic film makers, but if she had read some history and anthropology she would have seen that fashions in body hair are far older and more interesting than the porn industry.<br /><br />There are chapters on marriage and having children, filled with anecdotes from her own experiences. Hopefully these will encourage prospective parents to take antenatal visits and parenting classes seriously. Her second birth was easy, the first a painful disaster - preparation made all the difference. The chapter on abortion is the most cogent and sincere. Moran has previously written a newspaper article on her own decision to have an abortion and the discussion here shows that she has spent a bit more time considering the issues involved. Abortion is a topic that rarely gets intelligent reflection so this was welcome.<br /><br />The major weakness in the book is the poor writing style. The first eleven chapter headings all end in exclamation marks and the text is riddled with phrases and sentences in capital letters to show she is BEING FUNNY!! or that THIS IS IMPORTANT!!! Moran was a journalist on Melody Maker, a pop music magazine, and contributes articles on entertainment to The Times newspaper, so the tabloid style is understandable, but it too often distracts from the messages in the book. The other key weakness is Moran's poor skills in satire and comic writing. Much of what she writes is not funny at all. I only chuckled to myself once in the course of reading this book and now I can't even recall what that was about. Timing and a twist in context are central to humour and Moran's writing lacks both of these.<br /><br />While Moran is self-reflective about motherhood and the choice of having children, in other parts of the book she is far less insightful. Consumerism is not really grasped at all. In her chapter on fashion she admits that, like many women, she owns more shoes and bags than she will ever use, but never questions why this is so. She rightly points out that it is not for men - they are utterly uninterested in fashion. Women's fashion is competitive behaviour between and for women. It is wasteful and divisive, but at the same time she is opposed to `sisterhood'. Elsewhere, Moran is critical of celebrities and the celebrity culture we feed, but says nothing about her own role in this as a journalist. Instead, she admires Lady Gaga for her `radical agenda'. But what is radical about media and market manipulation to sell lots of product? Feminism could offer a way off the consumerist treadmill, but Moran doesn't even consider that possibility.<br /><br />Sexism is fundamentally about power, so Moran's idea of framing it in terms of `winners' and `losers' contains the germ of an interesting discussion. Unfortunately, it never gets off the ground. I was hoping that this book would be funny and incisive, but in the end I found it superficial and often boring to read. In her teenage years, Moran was inspired by Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch. Decades have passed since that was published, but it is still a treasury of ideas and a salutary read, even if humour is absent (Greer is Australian). Women and men of all ages would benefit from reading and re-reading Greer's book, but Moran's audience has been short-changed by this often muddle-headed and sadly unfunny approach to being a woman.
0395389496|5.0|This book arrived in perfect condition.  The illustrations are great and the book is a good size for the family to read together.
B002IVLH60|4.0|I bought this CD so I could listen to Just Breathe. Love that song! I like a couple of the other songs but most are too hard rock for me.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|If you are familiar with Indiana and Marion, you will LOVE this conclusion feature! It brings Indy from the 30's into the 50's. Then the surprises, after all these years. Like a good &#34;archeolgist&#34;, look for all the little &#34;artifact&#34; snips they hide in this feature from all the past Indiana Jones classics! Enjoy!
B000P0J024|5.0|I was already a fan and have a CD of the Traveling Wilburys already. I bought this set for my son-in-law as a Christmas present. I know he will love them but, as of yet, his verdict isn't in.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Lots of pieces and challenging to put together but great instruction booklets. This set has a lot of minifigures and lots of great little details inside. Looks great all put together.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was just amazing! I was not sure what to expect but you can count me as a fan of the author.
0446580848|3.0|This book was dull in comparison to &#34;The Lion&#34; and &#34;The Lion's Game&#34;.  I regret not waiting for paperback.  However, there are plenty of John Corey wisecracks and it offers an interesting insight into Yemeni culture.
B005LAII12|5.0|I enjoyed this movie enough to Pay to See it multiple times in theaters which i typically can not afford to do. unrated versión is funny but in my opinión certain parts are more funny in theatrical versión vs the different unrated versión of Same scene. Look forward to Watching it múltiple more times
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I can't wait for more levels! Definitely worth it!  I liked cut the rope a lot, but I may like this one better!  Just a cute yet challenging game!  I had no issues on my Kindle fire with it working. Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not much for this type of scenario, but this book kept my attention.  I wanted to know more and couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to find out more in the next book.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I received quickly and every disk was good, watched the entire series. Lots of fun. No complaints, it was great
B000YHG72E|4.0|Enjoyed this holiday film. I found Elf (Ferrell) amusing and uplifting in a Christmas themed comedy. Throughout enjoyed this film.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I loved cut the rope and still do but I love this game just as much! If you want loved cut the rope I guarantee you'll love pudding monsters!!!!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|There is not much to say here...it's Captain America kicking but throughout the film.  There is no cussing, no sex...just a good story with some killing of both good and evil.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have really enjoyed both of the first two books in this series.  The involvement of the characters in the most important events of the times is a little far-fetched, but effective as a story-telling method.  Can't wait to read #3.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|The story is cute, the colors are so pretty and the music is enjoyable.  Great story for the kids to watch.
079070546X|5.0|I purchased this for my friend for Christmas. This is our all-time favorite movie. Anything that can make you laugh this hard is well worth the money. Came well packaged and on time. Thanks!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This was a very good movie that shows two people reuniting who have been separated.  It is a good story of a torn family brought back together.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|After going through three of the Bourne Legacy movies with Matt Damon, I admit it was difficult to let go of that but, still, this one clearly delivered on its own, providing ample story and action in line with the prior Bourne movies.  I sincerely hope they continue on with this, utilizing the same characters in place.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a great story.  The colors and animation is unbelievable.  Everyone should watch this movie.  I believed that there would be some killing in the cartoon, but I was glad to be disappointed.  Great movie...you must watch.
B008Y7D4FY|5.0|This has got to be one of the MOST scary movies I've ever seen, and I watch a lot of them!  I SO was not expecting what I got out of this one, and was very pleased at how it ended (never a dull moment!).  Highly recommend.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This is really fun for kids, or your Asian wife who is addicted to cartoons.  No, seriously...I enjoyed the movie.  The graphics are amazing.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|If you love strategy and challenging yourself, be warned that this game is extremely addictive!  There are many games out there similar to this but this one, by far, exceeds all others!  Truly amazing...
B009JBZH54|4.0|I had a hard time retrieving the Ultra Violet copies...it took me at least an hour to get the Flixster website to cooperate with the Ultra Violet website and access code.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|This is one of the two best movies (in my opinion) to come out in 2012!  I love movies that keep me guessing and keep me engaged, never being an 'obvious' storyline that can quickly lead to boredom or repetition, and this movie certainly delivers!  If you're an individual who loves watching challenging movies and not someone who simply watches movies to 'be entertained', this is the movie for YOU!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|This is a nice movie about the dedication of an animal for his owner.  It turns sad toward the 2/3 portion of the film.  Be prepared to cry.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|My daughter uses this app.  We come up with all kinds of real or fictional personalities and it figures out who they are by asking questions.  It gets it right every time.  Fun for the whole family.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This was an excellent story.  I had never seen this film before.  I watched it two times and it will now be apart of my holiday movie list.
0399160450|5.0|I have read most of his books.  This was very interesting (and very long)  abot 858 pages.  The last one I read of his was hard to get into but this one held my interest completely.
B0049GYXDG|2.0|I watched this movie two times.  I have no clue as to what's going on...and English is my primary language.  I cannot imagine a child watching this movie and getting anything out of it.
0380789035|5.0|A truly unique read. Neil Gaiman has always been one of my favs with books like Coraline, Stardust, and Good Omens, but this one made the mental gears turn unlike any book I've ever read. Interesting twist in the end too.<br />Between extremely tall Leprichans and talking Ravens this is totaly a book for the shelf.
159420411X|3.0|this as also a gift to my sisters husband! He enjoys reading about future outcomes! He also likes the author too.
1609611543|5.0|This is a very informative book about wheat and the effects it has on the body.  Will recommend it to friends
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have always liked the DeMille books but this one was lacking the usual intensity of his stories. His main characters John Cory and his wife were simply annoying, John with his smart aleky remarks that he thought were funny although no one else really did  and his wife who was usually saying &#34;oh John&#34; and giving him a look and probably rolling her eyes.  They were in Yemen to hunt down a very dangerous terrorist called The panther but they actually seemed to make light of the situation.  John just seemed to think he was &#34;all that&#34; to take much seriously. He was someone had I been his wife Kate would have divorced a long time ago.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Once again Sherlock Holmes lives again in the modern day world. I was very please to see Sherlock teamed up with a female Doctor Watson. I must admit that I wasn't sure how it was goingto work out but it seems to be working out well. If you are a traditional list and perfer the old Sherlock Holmes & Doctor Watson then this series will probably not work for you. If you're open minded then give it a shot.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great trilogy... My husband was very happy to get this for Christmas. He has watched all 3 movies already and loved them.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|The music, and movie in general are just fun to watch.  My 3 year old loved watching it with her Nanna while she was here visiting and I watched it on several occasions.
0670026182|5.0|Beautiful design with rustic, casual styling. Recipes are simple and great. Made a breakfast for guests & everyone loved it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't read the first one and now wish I had. Very good hearing from first person. I didn't expect Katniss to be so weak though. I expected her to be more brave and fierce. Maybe in the next book.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. good graphics and story.it was worth the money I just wish the game was longer (it wasn't short just didn't want it to end)
B00138J342|5.0|One of the best albums from a great band. Very underrated, and any fan of the 90's Seattle scene should have this one in their collection.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Game had nice graphics. Fun to play.  Has crashed out a few times but resets with a tablet reboot.  Needs internet connection to keep up to date but can be played without it.
B005HSL626|3.0|It is a really fun game but I have to delete it and then reinstall it every few weeks and that gets really annoying.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|THIS IS APP IS TOTALLY AMAZING!! MY CHILD LOVES IT SHE CAN NOT STOP PLAYING IT!! KEEPS HER AND I ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS WHEN WE NEED IT!
1455121924|5.0|Although I HATED  the narrator, i couldn't have read this book without the audio version.  Had some great material to kick start your new year
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is jam packed full of interesting tips, techniques and ideas.  I am not a novice cook but subscribe to the concept of keeping it simple and learning to do a few things really well.  I learned this the hard way over the years but Tim has it figured out and I have learned a few new tricks myself from this book.  One of my favourites is the iphone in the mixing bowl and that alone was well worth the read.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have admired Susan Boyle since she was first discovered on Britain Has Talent. This CD, Standing Ovation, is a delightful continuation of Susan's music. I also appreciate the musical arrangements that support Susan as well as the selection of music.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is awesome! I rated this book 5 stars because & I love it  because it's so funny. I recommend this book to everyone!
0679809015|4.0|Young children enjoy learning and imitating the sounds different animals produce. The illustrations are nice and friendly, they make city children discover animals they rarely see.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This was also a gift so I can only rate based on my son's opinion . he loves all dream theatre
141694737X|5.0|An amusing classic for young children, they love it and soon get to know it by heart. It stimulates their imagination.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book it was a quick easy read, written for the teenager but good for a 40 year old.  Good themes and an exciting read.<br /><br />I picked the book to catch up on pop culture but found it very enjoyable.
B00005V9IL|5.0|This is one of my all-time favs!  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star in it and it is directed by James Cameron.  It is a story of a civilian oil rig crew who is recruited for a search-and-rescue mission.  A diver (Harris) finds himself on something like an underwater odyssey 25,000 ft. below the ocean's surface.  It is a real thriller, it takes you to the deepest depths and then raises you up to a high level of elation as the two who were once husband and wife find a mysterious power that has the power to change the world for good or for evil and in the process rekindle their love for one another.  Wonderful movie, wonderful feeling after having watched it!
B0082GQ5HG|4.0|This was a gift for my son.  He liked the movie but it was not as funny as it looked.
1401322786|3.0|I am an avid Mitch Albom fan having read all his books prior to this one. I apprecaite the message and it was written in his signature style of very short and straightforward chapters. However, I found that the characters did not have much depth and the back story was more richly woven that those of the characters Father Time was helping in the present.<br />Worth a read but I can't see myself re-reading it or recommending it as I would with &#34;Tuesdays with Morrie&#34;, &#34;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&#34;, &#34;Have a little Faith&#34;, &#34;For One More Day&#34; etc
B00A757EFW|4.0|I would recomend this APP to my frieds and family. I think this is a fun APP for kids nd adults of all ages.
0553062182|5.0|I can't say enough about the information in this book.  It helped me come to some powerful revelations about myself.  As it said it would, it profoundly changed how I will deal with my way of viewing my actions and reactions moving foward.  I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they are an HSP or knows one.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|The flexibility of this program &amp; the interest of choosing world wide events makes it the greatest app in my collection.  You can't go wrong with it.
0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day is a good view of the killing of Osama Ben Laden from an insider who was on the ground. From this perspective anyone who is interested in that historical event (and who isn't?) it deserves high praise. The author (using a nom de plum) tells about his training and the training of US Navy SEALS without providing too much detail. If this was not an historical event, it would make an interesting bit of fiction. The writing is crisp and the graphics included make the mission easy to follow.<br />Not a written masterpiece but a very good account of an event that impacted the world.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good read with the typical twists and turns Connelly adds to every book.  Keeps the suspense up and teases with hints while recognizing the inevitable politics that come into play on every case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My family got this game and it was great there's a game for everyone and only one thing to spend points on new games so no fights
B004H4XLR4|5.0|A friends child had this toy and my grandson loved it!  Been looking for it forever at toy stores and couldnt find it. After a year, i looked on amazon. Thank you for making this little boy very happy!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|get this game. its a lot of fun. zeptolab created another addictive game. Look forward to what they will come up with next.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Not realistic at all, worse part is jumping scense, what every happend to the tarred and feathered cat? was not a good rental, digital, plus I rented Total Recal and it never streamed to my lap, so Amazon has everything you want but cant seem to find a pay me back for product not recieved app, ;(
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I really love this case. The clip in structure fits the kindle hd perfectly. The kindle can be unclipped and repositioned for different purposes-- charging while skyping/watching movies-- which was a hassle with OTHER cases as the charging port was only accessible from the bottom side.<br /><br />The case feels durable and my kindle feels very secure. It also looks very professional (black). When closed, the case puts the kindle into sleep mode which is nice if you are often in a hurry or forgetful.<br /><br />The only downfall was the smell of the case. It has a very strong, chemical smell which may upset some peoples allergies or asthma. The smell dissipated after about two days of moderate use.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Although I don't like touch games this one I have to say is pretty amazing. the graphics cant compare to console but that must mean they are top of the line for touch games. over all a great game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never read a book like this...WOW!!!! From beginning to end. I didn't want to put it down...to even eat or go potty!! Lol<br />I mean rethinking one thing the entire book....and them I'm reading and boom, not what I expected. What a twist!<br /><br />The love holder and sky share is so raw and special! What a story! Thanks Colleen! Read it people! It's that good!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm so addicted with this game! It is the best game EVER!!! This is worth the money! It is easy in the beginning but if you're older don't worry it gets harder! GET THIS GAME!! Ps. get this game! ;)
0061122416|5.0|I was stunned by every sentences when I read this book. Each page has something to tell me, each sentence has something to make me think... Deeply about life, deeply about my life, others... There is much more depth of wisdom in this short story about Santiago...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some of the signs of a good story is its capability to immerse the reader its world and events.  Despite the alien, post-apocalyptic setting in which Wool takes place, I didn't struggle to suspend disbelief as gradually learned more of the working of the silo, the reason for its existence and the lives of its denizens.  The pacing for the characterization and plot development was excellent.  I cared for what happened to characters, and felt it gave a satisfying conclusion.  There is obvious potential for a continuation of the stories and the characters that I would love to see written one day, but I didn't feel left hanging.
B008ULRY78|4.0|I been waiting for this movie to come out for a long time ever since it appear at the TIFF awards. I been seeing that people said it was awesome and brutal. So I decided to watch it. And boy this movie delivered! It had the kind of action movie that I like the most. People were getting their throat sliced, heads shot off, stabbed, and even blown up by a refrigerator. But what I loved is the fighting. This new guy Iko could be the next Jet Li but more brutal. The man cuts through bad guys like knife through butter. And he had some of those literally. And Mad Dog is one tough mother. The 2 on 1 fight at the end may be the best fight in years. I mean the fight lasted over 6 minutes. This is a great action, martial arts movie. I can't wait to see Berandal in 2014.
0345803493|4.0|keeps your attention!  at times it's predictable but love the details of the intimate moments.  it's a real quick read.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Fun plot, great song choice, fun characters! I would totally recommend this movie! Rebel Wilson is a crack-up, Anna Kendrik is solid, and Skylar Astin is fantastic!
0060775858|5.0|A gift for my baby nephew. I love this book, it's a classic. I wanted the board book version but accidentally bought the hard cover version. Still, in great condition, he just can't hold it for a long time, too young.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|When considered in concert with George Anderson's books, the book makes an excellent case for an extremely benificent afterlife. Well written and quite compelling
B008GAV6YA|4.0|I was assuming this book was brand new but it looked slightly used. The corners were a little worn on the spine. I was very disappointed having to give this as a Christmas gift. However, it was for a child and he loved the book.
B000006045|4.0|I was just listening to kendrick lamar's Swimming and I couldn't help but think that he is borrowing from Massive Attack.This album is so close to perfection and is so evenly paced that noone could possibly top this not even Massive Attack! It just sets a standard for creative excellence.They were definitely hitting their stride when they put this together.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|The game does not know how to castle and does not know that white moves first.  Impossible to use I am deleting.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game is good but it has two rather aggravating glitches. The first glitch happens when you subsequently launch the game. The game will load up for ten seconds and and then crash. The only way around this is to launch the game multiple until you get lucky enough for it not to crash. The second glitch is that none of your action are saved after thirty minutes. This only makes the first glitch even more annoying due to the fact that you have to close and relaunch the game. What I have played is addictive and engaging.  Three stars.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book just makes me feel content and good about life. The pursuit of happiness is the ultimate struggle we face.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Being the mom of 3 gurlz, high school thru college-age, the maturity level of the high school characters was a little unbelievable.  That being said, it was a great read.  Not too graphic, no need to be.  I will be recommending it to all 3 of my gurlz as I have \\"Slammed\\" & \\"Point of Retreat.\\"
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I am not a person of many words but I just have to say how much I have enjoyed this series.  It is the best continuing storyline I have seen for quite a while.  I am waiting anxiously for Series 5 to become available.  The actors are believable. Bryan Cranston is playing the part of a lifetime.  The other actors are the best and I comment all of them on their loyalty to the part they play.  Congrats to the Director and all of the pruducers for making such a great series.
1419705849|5.0|My son couldn't wait to read the book.  He laughed through the whole book.  Please keep writing more!  Shipment was fast.  Thanks for the great service
B009H442DG|5.0|I knew I would like this CD the moment I heard the sample of John Travolta singing Baby It's Cold Outside. Both he and Olivia Newton John do a great job recording the songs you know and want to hear on a Christmas album. Their voices are rich and the whole CD is fun. Vey happy with my purchase
1419702238|5.0|My son read the book and enjoyed it.  He is hooked.  Please keep writing more!  Shipment was fast.  Thanks for the great service
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The slowest, most mundane flick I've seen in recent times. From Levitt's look which was an epic failure to the slow drawl of a premise that plays itself out like a B-grade contender, skip on out on this one would be my strong recommendation.
067144901X|5.0|Bought for 5 mo old grandson.  Heavy gauge construction and quite nicely written for children that age.  This one is second in his liking, the other two being his favorites, the Chicken book and Look Look, black and white book, according to daughter-in-law.
1451648537|5.0|Before reading this I really disliked Steve based on the negative stories I've seen over the years. I must say this book really turned me around and gave me an understanding of what made this guy tick. I loved his independent streak the most and his willingness to be extreme. Just the way he handled his diet was wild alone. I was adopted, so that element of his life was particularly interesting to me. I found many things he did extremely funny, even though he was widely reported to have had a real cruel streak that would rear its ugly head when least expected. I probably could never have worked for this guy for more than a day or two but he definitely was a fascinating person to read about.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Was expecting it to be like the real facebook. and I can't get the Game Aquarium which is the only reason I keep going on facebook.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|great stuff. exactly what it said it was . this is the crown jewel of the walking dead season blu rays
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This show rocks! Can't wait until the next season comes out. I have been addicted since it first aired...thanks to the writers for creating an awesome show!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down. What an amazing book; I cannot wait to start on the next one.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Everyone knows this film is one of the greats of cinema, and this BluRay presents it in the best transfer I have ever seen. Reminds me of the quality of restoration work done on the Bond films.  Fantastic!
B0000C2IQD|5.0|Never get tired of watching this movie. Kids love it as well, but there is something about the classic movies you just can't avoid not having part of your DVD collection.
B008476HBM|5.0|An entertaining look into the always turbulent and never direct course of courtship and marriage; it is well worth reading over and over again.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and now my kids love it as well. I can't resist NOT to watch it when they want to.
0440245206|5.0|This is one of her best books. I wish I could go visit this hotel. I usually don't discuss the books I read with my husband. He said I told him the whole story in my sleep. I have been an avid reader of Danielle Steel since her very first book. Thanks.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|After watching this movie, we often tell them we are calling Nanny McPhee and she will what she did in the movie of they don't behave.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This is a fun movie.  I turn the closed caption on because there is some French spoken in it, and I can read it better than I can comprehend it spoken.  But if you have no French, it is still easy to understand the plot, directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock.  This movie proves his sense of humor!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I liked this story, fast paced and enjoyable. Its a fun read, the title drew me in to preview the book and I figured it looked like an interesting read, turned out to be better than I thought, I read it in one night.
0802473156|5.0|This was a very interesting and a quick read. I highly recommend this book to newly weds. Its helped me out a lot.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Cher is phenominal and Christine just adds to the sexiness of the theme.  If you like musicals this is a must have.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love Thor. Chris Hemsworth is my absolute favorite. This is my favorite movie in the Avenger series. You can't have the collection without Thor.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book ever it is so interesting and great. I couldn't put it down. You should read it its awesome.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I love Hawaii Five-O! Best cop show ever! I don't regret buying this. I watch these episodes over and over again.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Cool I think it was almost perfect the way Jeff wrote it and Jeff thanks for letting us read your awesome books Old what I would do without u
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book wasan incredible read and that's saying a lot because I barely ever read. I highly recommend it to everyone. Great story, great action I give it a 5/5!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book deserves more than 5 stars but sadly that's the limit. I enjoyed this book so much. I am completely in awe of Hopeless. I never would have imagined that all of this happened to our beloved Sky, but it did. She went through things not many people can handle, and at times leaving her hopeless. But in feeling hopeless she found the courage and strength to move forward. Though she wasn't alone, she had Holder and he her. And together they create the most wonderful and beautiful book I have ever read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great way to get a kool game of spider solitaire!!! Lemon juice and the three stooges to remove them in hd
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Glad it ended the way I hoped it would! One of the best series I have read. I'd like to see it continued.
B006ON41FC|4.0|On my kindle it flips the screen and really irritates me. It is really fun but I have to lay my kindle down to play it.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I think that it was very good and funny Jeff Kinney did good and  the next book is good !
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book & couldn't put it down. As a cancer survivor it hit close to home. I felt a connection with the characters and really understood where they were coming from.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Had me going back and forth with the excitement and death and pulled just enough heart strings to make me rate 5 stars
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was wonderful! Very gripping, beautiful story that makes your heart smile!<br /><br />The ending is phenomenal! Makes you hold your breath though!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|There were a few grammatical mistakes but overall it was a good book. It wasn't as interesting as I thought it'd be. A very common storyline was used.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I liked it a lot I don't understand  what it  means but I know a littlte Bit about it if I could I would explain it bot I don't understand it·I would like for you to explain it to me but y'all are proudly busy so I'm not going to encrypt you bye
B005LAII8K|4.0|Elements of this film reminded me of the first time I saw Blade Runner.  Rather than the visuals, I mean the writing and bounty hunter aspects, and the fluidity with which characterizations develop over the time of the picture (much less the time forward and backwards)  Just enough information to allow for imagination to take hold and define the reality in which most of this takes place.  Who would need another explanation for why society seems to be at a breakdown, or only working at a venal level ?  That in itself would be boring.  The present at hand is the story. And I was impressed by Joseph Gordon Levitt, even Bruce, and mesmerized by Ms Blount.  If you believe that criminals are the only people operating the time warp, then just follow what is superb noir exposition of less than prominent peoples.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Very different than the movie. Enjoyed it!<br />If I had read the book and then seen the movie, I would have been very disappointed!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Such a great list of cast but so very upset the way it ended! Maybe the second one can answer all of everyone's questions!!
B004I744AS|5.0|Just what I expected and meets my requirements for the purchase as made and the service was very good, ok.
0007447868|1.0|Skip this boring book and and go straight to Book 5. Boring. I read this book to fall a sleep to. No way this nonsense gets made into of GOT TV shows. Bunch of jibberish of characters walking down streams and thinking about diner.  GRRM should end GOT of with Book 6 and then do a prequel like the Hobbit.
B00009R6J7|4.0|It's expensive for what it is, but it works well. There's no issue with it being off like I've seen in the reviews of some of the cheaper ones.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've had this app for four days and I'm already great at it! I have so much fun with it and if you don't buy this app then your crazy. :-)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished this book in a few days simply because I couldn't put it down. I was glued to the book and absolutely cannot wait for the movie!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Best game I have purchased in a year. Even playing on easy mode was challenging. Looking forward to the follow up game
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer writes really well, it keeps you involved from the beginning to the end of the book. Can't wait to read the next one.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Best soap opera ever! And we mean that in the best wall possible. Can't wait for season 3. Great price on prime too.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|if you love the beatles music..this movie is a must see these young singers do most of the songs jusitce..a fine tribute : )
B003XRELEI|5.0|Vonnegut was a mad and sad genies. This is my favorite of his books as it embodies so well the themes that seem to run through all his writing. I would describe it as a melancholy optimism. Some one once described his work with the statement &#34;When love fails, curtsey will suffice&#34; and I think that nails it on the head. Others have told me the find his work depressing but I find myself so energized by it. Would highly recommend!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run because its freaking awesome I don't know what to say I just love it. a lot yea
B008A1TIOK|3.0|I heard the review on NBR and I purchased this and I will stick to the ORIGINAL VERSION. It is OK but nothing to do GREAT rEVIEWS ON.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|could not keep my interest.  would not recommend.  started out good then lost interest.<br />not one of my favorite reads
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I really like Donald Fagen's music. However this CD starts a bit rough but when you get through the last 3 takes it is quite good. He plays with musicians I have not heard of so I guess I have to listen to it more to appreciate this CD. His older solo works are better.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you love the Dark Knight Trilogy, this is the perfect set to own.<br /><br />It has all three movies and is presented in a nice textured box for storage and display.
B004478AS4|4.0|a fascinating window into another world, with lessons and interest for anyone (of any age) who might read it. Expertly written and I couldn't put it down, once started.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|movies look and sound great,I like the packaging too .It's like a book. Every movie is in it's own page.Like Star Wars .This is a big space saver.The book style package should be the industry standard..
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my hubby.  He loves it.  I love that all the movies are in one set.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Wonderful acting, great writing. I never would have thought I would like this series. Take a chance and you will not regret it.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is great and its great that its free!!! My sister went on my kindle get the password wrong 4 times and set it to factory defaults!I HATED IT!!!! I was surprized amazon even had that opinion!!! I thought it would disable it but it didn't!!! i was really sad and then i called amazon when it happed a 2nd time I called amazon and THEY recomended this app!!! THATS HOW AMAZING THIS APP IS!!! ITS THE BEST APP EVER!!!!! GET IT!!!!!
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|This was a cute game but definitely more of a child's game. It was repetitious and way too easy for an adult.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a little difficult to figure out at first,  but fun to play. It will keep me occupied while my boyfriend watches wrestling.
B006O2QNOU|1.0|this was probably the biggest waste of my day off ever. thanks a lot stupid movie! terrible way to start my amazon prime experience!
1401216676|3.0|From reading the reviews, a lot of people love this read. I am not one of those people. This comic does have some dark twists but ultimately is just silly. Artwork is not as good as other batman comics as of late.
B008NF45S2|1.0|Worthless app. My printer (epson xp 400) is not supported, there is no way to add drivers, and no way to get a refund. Don't waste your money.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorites.  It was filmed during the era and is a very stirring movie.  A true all star cast!
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|Didn't work. Should of listened and stuck to the reviews. Waste of money. Don't do it. Didn't work on Sony Bravia tv.
B006FE83UE|5.0|So much has been said about this film.  There is absolutely nothing more that can be said.  Just watch the movie and enjoy it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I couldn't be happier after getting this app. It's the only way I can tell exactly how low my battery is or if my battery is getting charged. I highly recommend this app to everyone.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I had never heard of Diana Krall before I saw her on David Letterman.  I absolutely loved her performance and knew I had to get her album (CD).  &#34;Glad Rag Doll&#34; is a fantastic album and I heartily recommend it.
140053271X|4.0|Got this for my niece for Christmas and she said its works great downloaded alot of books already  she uses it all the time.
B003Y5D776|5.0|OVER THE YEARS I HAD ACCUMULATED MANY TAPES WHICH I WANTED TO HAVE IN CDS. I DOWNLOADED FINAL VINYL, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM START TO FINISH, AND STARTED TRANSFERRING MUSIC, INSTRUCTIONAL TAPES, AND SERMONS. I AM ALSO ABLE TO USE THIS DEVICE WITH MY HIGH SPEED TAPE TRANSFER, AND RECORD MY BOX OF OLD RECORDS. LIFE IS EASY AND THE STORAGE IS NOW HAVE IS PLENTIFUL. THIS DEVICE IS SO PORTABLE, I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR SUCH THIS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY. THE PRICE IS RIGHT, THE DEVICE IS SIMPLE (IF YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS) AND HAVE TIME TO SAMPLE YOUR UPLOADS BEFORE FINAL PRODUCTION. ALL MATERIALS CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO YOUR PHONE, IPOD, COMPUTER, OR EVEN YOUR MP3 PLAYER. ENJOY THE OLDIE MOLDIES WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT SCRATCHED RECORDS OR TWISTED TAPES.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I found Ms. Flynn's writing engaging in it's simple, clean lines and realistic approach. The characters are well developed and totally believable. The plot was engrossing, and I had real difficulty putting the book down for say length of time. I like the book so much that I immediately read her other two books also.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The only problem is that this keeps freezing on my iPad, which is seemingly an issue with the whole Instant Video app or just overall with the Amazon system of delivery
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Pretty much everything has already been said about this book. An amazing read which took me on an emotional journey which I didn't want to end. Highly recommended.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|What a refreshing twist. Daddy was a bad man with a conscience. Mommy is in it up to her ears in evil also. Coincides with the new DALLAS TV show, I guess. Nice to have a superhero with no powers but those he gets from practice and hard work.<br /><br />Good arch story.
0394818237|2.0|The pictures in this book are well-drawn, but the ink is so faded.  It hasn't gotten my grandson's attention,<br />and I am disappointed.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|You got all of the TV shows in one collection.  I am still watching them!  It would make a great gift for someone.  When I told someone over Christmas that I bot the collection, they were interested.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was very different from any book I've read before.  It kept my interest, but was not one of the best books I have read.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was definitely entertaining.  We went into it wondering if it would be &#34;Bring It On&#34; meets &#34;Glee.&#34;  We were basically right.  That said, it was really fun.  Rebel Wilson steals the show and Anna Kendrick is great.
B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter is a movie buff. She wanted this movie and was very happy to get it. I know she'll be watching it a lot.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome and the best part is its free  I'd get it right know if I did not already have it
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This was a present for my daughter. She was very happy to receive it at christmas and enjoys watching it.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This did not download properly.  Had to try it a second time.  Would appear we were charged for that.<br />That should not happen.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|My Daughter loves movies and this is one she requested. She was very happy to recieve it when she opened it,
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the movies of this trilogy.  The price was great.  I even ordered another set to give as a gift to my brother for Christmas.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is an awesome book!  Read it in a day as I could not put it down.  Very good read.  I will purchase more of his books
B005XLN97M|4.0|My daughter wanted the dream house, but $140 on mainly cardboard didn't appeal to me. I ended up purchasing this and the cruise ship for pretty much the same price and so glad I did. My 7 y/o only needed a little help assembling this and it's done great. There was one sticker we couldn't figure out where to put, but otherwise I'm so glad I chose this instead of the big dream house.
B000Y96EWK|5.0|Hoping the next movie will be better but as far as first movies go it set things up for the next movie.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I am still half way through, but it is very addictive so I believe it won't last me long. Better than expected on a very interesting and actual topic
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is an excellent documentary, but don't spent $3. It's on Netflix for free. I suggest that unless you're a Prime member, you go watch this fantastic movie there.
B00006LFGD|5.0|bought this for my partner who has a lot of Barbra Streisland dvds and cds.  He loved it.  Will purchase more from her.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I heard nothing but good things about this concert over the past five years, but I had my doubts. Because I love Zeppelin so much, I knew it would break my heart if the performance was substandard, or even just the least bit &#34;off&#34;.  All I can say is that after the opening credits, from the moment they started to play, before the lights were even up in the O2, I KNEW it was going to be absolutely amazing.  And I was right.  It surpassed anything I could've imagined, and I knew immediately that all the positive feedback I'd heard didn't do it justice.  I spent almost the entire two hours staring at the screen in awe, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried, more than once.  To see Page, Plant, Jones, and Jason Bonham, who channeled his father and them some, put on a show like this at their age (Jason excepted), sounding every bit the legendary Led Zeppelin of the 70s...there aren't enough superlatives to describe the feeling.  But, to borrow a song title from AC/DC, thunderstruck would be a good way to describe it.  Unfortunately for me, I am now an over-the-top Jimmy Page fanatic -- and I'm not a musician!  I spent hours tonight trying to find &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34; on DVD, without success, so that will be the next thing I order.  Tonight!  I would be loathe to say anything negative about &#34;Celebration Day&#34;, but if it sucked, I would say it sucked.  There's nothing negative to say.  Nothing.  My mind is still blown, and if I had the time and didn't have a neighbor who loves to complain if we make too much noise, I'd be watching this concert every day, with the volume turned up to 11, until I couldn't take it anymore.  Then, after a short break, I'm sure I'd need to watch it again.  I urge my fellow Zeppelin fans to trust my review, order this set, then sit back and be prepared to have your mind blown as well.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|have always followed Susan Boyle from the beginning we saw her featured in England.  We always keep track of what she is doing and if she ever comes to WA we will be there.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the most moving and delightful books I have ever read (3 times actually!).  Garth Stein engages you in this story from the very first page to the last. It is not just a book about an amazing dog, Enzo, and his owner, but it is a book about relationships, love, determination, and courage.  It is about the twists and turns life can take, and how people handle them.  If you are a dog lover, you will thoroughly enjoy this book.  It will make you look at your dog in a completely new way. If you think he is almost human now, you will certainly think that after reading this book.  The human interactions and events in the book are emotionally and humorously viewed through the dog's eyes.  Enzo is so intuitve and funny that you find yourself crying one minute and laughing the next.  But you don't have to be a dog lover to appreciate this wonderfully told story about life.  It can be a gut-wrenching journey, but so worth it!
B004FOA84A|3.0|I finished this in literally less than an hour.  I like these types of games, but they could really stand to make them longer.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I thought this was an alright movie..seems like they showed all the really funny parts in the previews for it. Normally I am a big Johnny Depp fan but this was not one of my favorites.. worth watching I guess, but I wouldn't watch it again. Too bad cause it had a great cast.. I think they previewed it too much.. Don't worry Johnny I'm still a big fan..lol!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It is so refreshing to have media performed by actually TALENTED people, not just famous people.  (Paris Hilton, anyone?)  Even better, everything these family men do, is family friendly.  I love this music.  My kids love this music.  My husband loves this music.  The youtube videos are priceless and we watch them more often than anything else on youtube.  They are super inspirational to kids taking music lessons and hugely entertaining.  I hope to help my kids find their passion as these men have, help them to do it excellently (as these men definitely do), and make the world a better place at the same time.  Kuddos to The Piano Guys!

B00A5IYXY6|4.0|Le Havre is Kaurismaki's modern fairy-story set in Normandy.It's about an elderly shoe-shine man,Marcel Marx,living with his wife,Arletty and dog,he's devoted to her despite poverty,but they are happy and are surrounded by a supportive community.His wife becomes ill and has to go into hospital,but doesn't want him to know the serious nature of the illness.While he's on his own he comes upon a young illegal immigrant boy,Idrissa, who he lets into his house and looks after away from the Port Authorities.He goes to Calais and contacts Idrissa's granddad,who says his son was meant to be taking Idrissa to London to stay with his auntie,but his son died.He passes on a message to his grandson to obey Marcel. It's a little like Kid With A Bike strangely, people want to help the boy, people are good.There's no great drama or shoot-outs(the first scene is more a visual joke) or sex scenes.Kaurismaki is indebted to Tati(simple café scenes,small groups of people conversing,bright colours)or Renoir or Rene Clement.We also get a very dry take off of a police inspector out of Melville.<br /><br />The Kafka book of nouvelles read out to Arletty in hospital is the story,\\" Children on a Country Road\\",which depicts a beautiful return to a lost innocence,and the superb image-\\"When one joins in a song with others it is like being drawn on by a fish-hook.\\"That's it, the miracle of innocence and goodness in human life,the individual against the impersonality of globalisation and society's restrictions,the support of the down-trodden by the small tribes of decent folk,the smaller things that make life worth living.Andre Wilms is marvellous as Marcel,getting charity from friends,bar people and shop-keepers and organising a charity concert by Little Bob(Jean-Pierre Laud) to get the 3000 Euros he needs to get the boy on a boat to London.Of course Kaurismaki shows in 4 takes at the end a miracle: death become life, worthy of Dreyer.Loved Kati Outinen as Arletty and the dog was simply great and the music was topping!
0446554995|2.0|Finally, I downloaded in my Kindle, my Pendergast fix.I browsed all 306 reviews on this book and I found that only a very small percentage of fans feel the way I do.I wanted closure, and I didn't get it!!! Im not going to go into a long, lengthily critique but the bottom line,for me, is..Pendergast should have taken the shot. The old Pendergast would have taken out Alban.A killer of extraordinary talents such as Alban-regardless-come on man!!!.If Pendergast would have taken the shot I might have been able to get past the silly Cussler-ish, Numa Nazi nonsense.I've been around since \\"Relic\\" and I was considering calling it quits but I decided to stick it out.I suspect, down the road, It might be Papa Aloysius & Tristram  VS Uncle Diogenes & Alban.We will see what we will see. Pendergast has been, for me , such a long wonderful journey I cant bail-But he should have taken the shot.

B0051MKNV8|5.0|I just loved watching the movie on Netflix that I just had to get one for my girlfriend since I know she didn't watch the movie yet and she's a Bradley Cooper fan just like me!  In fact, my girlfriend does buy DVD's and I wanted her to add this one to her DVD collection which she'll sharing with her other friends who have not seen the movie also.  My girlfriend just came back from her vacation and said she can't wait to watch this movie!!!  We all know he's so handsome and such a good actor!!!
B008JF8O9M|5.0|This app works great! When you go pro, you are only buying a licence. You have to keep the trial version in order for the app to work. You have to launch the pro version from the trial version icon. The pro version icon does nothing. Just hide that icon. When you launch Printbot, click on about and it should read Printbot Pro version 2.2.5. I jumped the gun because app didn't work and wanted a refund. Figured it out and what a great app! I can print from my email and the web. In order to print you have to send printing project to the clipboard first and then hit print. The trial app is basically used to see if your printer is compatible  with this app. If you don`t see your printer listed in the app or the app doesn't work for you in the trial version, check how your printer is setup. It has to be a wireless network. If you don't see your printer listed, try the same brand but, a different model. Some printers use the same drivers in different models of the same brand. If that doesn't work then don't go pro.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i loved this book. i love all of colleen's books!! colleen writes awesome books!!! i can't wait for her next book!!! she is an awesome writer!
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|This movie was interesting graphically, but the plot, the characters, and the annoyingly adolescent mayhem of the star were unappealing. The worst Pixar movie we've seen.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I heard this book was a must read, so I added it to the list. I have to admit that halfway through the book, I wasn't getting what the hype was about. I found myself struggling to get through it. The story was interesting and the characters were intriguing, however it wasn't keeping my attention. I kept with it and I am glad I did. There was a moment when the magic hit and I couldn't put it down. The story began to come together and I was hooked. The way the author wove all the characters together was superb. It took awhile, however it was worth it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter.  After watching my own video of The Hunger Games, I question it is appropriate for a 13 year old girl, but she liked it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|While fervent Batman fans may long for more special features, this trilogy package came with everything I wanted for a lot less $$$ than a BluRay package. I got a DVD for each film that plays the theatrical release in the wide aspect ratio. The disks have the standard language and CC options, and a few short \\"the making of ...\\" features. PLUS each film also has a digital copy thru Flixster!  For casual fans and admirers of C. Nolan's films like me, this package is a winner.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|This is the second book in the Crossfire Trilogy, and unfortunately, I was not as taken with this novel as with the first. The story continues with Gideon's and Eva's love story. Although the reader believes in their love for one another, it is definitely a dysfunctional relationship. The two main characters, suffer from abuse issues from their past, and they are trying to work through them. The characters are the most communicative and expressive with one another during their sexual exploits, but I found some of the scenarios to be too unrealistic and over-the-top. Additionally, at times, their sexual interaction had a violent edge to it. I had been intrigued after reading book one, and was looking forward to book two. I am less inclined to read the conclusion due to be published later this year. However, I would have rated the book with 2 1/2 stars if given the option.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A coming of age book with a twist.  I enjoy fantasy and this book has a different take than I was expecting.  It was an easy read and kept my interest throughout.
0425263908|3.0|Bared to You by Sylvia Day is similar to Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James in its story-line and sexual content. This is the first book in a trilogy. The novel held my interest. It is a love story, but one where both main characters have major issues of abuse that they are trying to overcome. I am interested to find out how the story progresses in the next two books. I would have given this novel a 3 1/2 star rating if given the option.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|If you're looking for a great survival knife, this is it.  This thing is a real tank, its a beast of a knife.  i would definitely recommend this knife to anyone looking for a good survival/camp knife.  Of course amazon had the best price, and the best delivery time.  Great job Amazon

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|In my opinion, the only way I can think of to describe this book is quiet. There is no witty repartee,or not much of it, and not much passion,but there is a touching story.<br />It is the story of two lost and broken souls who find each other.<br />Robert,the Duke of Clermont is a man who grew up without the love of family. It's not that he didn't have someone who bore the title of father, it's just that his father was not a man who knew how to love or who had a character one could look up to. Robert,who physically bore a striking resemblance to his father, grew up praying he would be nothing like him,and made it his purpose in life to be exactly that...nothing like his father. His mother spent the entirety of his life being absent both literally and metaphorically.<br />Miranda Lane,aka Wilhelmina Pursling, has spent her life trying to hide herself behind simple garb,and a quiet,unassuming nature,trying to make herself as small and inconsequential as possible.<br />Through Robert's need to be a different man than his father was, comes a story of Robert's involvement in trying to help the working man by distributing handbills and it is through these handbills that Robert and Miranda are brought together, it is through the existence of these handbills that the story of their lives unfolds and it is through these handbills that commitment and both Robert and Miranda blossom.

B004J64QR4|5.0|This 25th anniversary of Les Miserables is fantastic.  It is a great rendition of the play by the top performers.  If you enjoyed the play and the movie and want to continue to hear those inspiring songs this is a must have.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not the scary movie or television show type because they truly freak me out, but the acting and writing is so amazing and unpredictable that I can't keep away. I have to know what is happening with my favorite characters...the writers make you care.  The Walking Dead is a work of art!
B005IQZB14|1.0|I expected an inspiring story about a hike.  Instead this book is written by a woman who is full of herself, and obsessed with sex. Come on...seriously...starting a hike of this length without doing the research or planning is stupid at best. And is it truly necessary to include such a horrid description about shooting a horse?  Not worth your time to read it.
B00026WU4G|5.0|i had it years ago,this cd sounds just as good if not better.I appreciate it it heightens my perception.thanks,Mark M
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It was a great book for my kids to read.  It was exciting, entertaining and very strange, without being sexually dirty.
B005K01VZS|4.0|To me it seems amazing that something so real could also seem as if the whole story was made up in someone's head. I enjoy quite a few of Mitch Alborn's books, and this is no exception. Alborn has a distinct writing style that is easy for anyone to read. It flows into one piece and there aren't many parts you need to read over and over again to understand what the author was attempting to say.<br /><br />  Have a Little Faith is about a man (Mitch Alborn) who grew up in a very religious setting and had a lot of opportunities to be successful. After he \\"grew up\\" he did become successful, but he moved away from where he grew up and left his faith behind with him. The small traditions and rules that he had known no longer matter to him. He only returned to his home of New Jersey once a year to attend the High Holiday Service at the synagogue he grew up in. At one of these reunions the Rabbi approached him and asked him to write his eulogy. Alborn writes, \\"And as is often the case with faith, I thought I was being asked a favor, when in fact I was being given one.\\"<br /><br />This book has three parallel stories that obviously will intertwine and complete each other as you read it. There is one in the present tense as Mitch Alborn slowly becomes stronger in his faith and learns more and more about this man he had been intimidated by his whole life. The other two are of the past. One is the childhood of Mitch that helps explain a lot of what is happening at the time. The second one is of a man known as Henry. At first his story seems quite out of place and insignificant. Once you read the end of this book, however, you realize that it made all the difference.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone enjoys books with a very prominent meaning. If you want to be given a different perspective of life and inspiration and motivation to perhaps live your life differently, read this and it will make you think. It will make you think of what is really important in life and what really matters here on Earth.nd what really matters here on Earth.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book seemed like it could've ended right at the beginning, but it was really good. Wish there was more interaction with Jeff and less with her friends/family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book.  I started and finish in one weekend.  My first read for 2013.  I couldn't put the book down.  Anastasia was looking for love and Christian was looking for a good f---.  Getting ready to order the next book.  This is worth a re-read.  Anastasia Steele got more than she could handle.  Mr. Grey is off the chain.

B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is required reading for anyone interested in human behavior.  It's extremely interesting and informative.  Many of us already suspected what Kahneman and his colleagues have uncovered: people aren't so rational.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This was an entertaining story that leaves you guessing where the story is going to go. Best part of the book is the main character is a very unique and complex, flawed woman. If you like Gone Girl you will enjoy this book even though the book isn't as good as Gone Girl.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A must read book if you are a dog lover. Slow beginning but catches your attention quickly. This story is full of love. Love for a dog, companion, wife, child, and dream!
0345803485|1.0|I believed the hype and finally gave in and all I can say is I just wish I would have read the reviews prior to wasting my life reading this book.<br /><br />Ana is so insecure has no backbone and the mention of her \\"inner goddess\\" is almost on ever damn page! Grey is a freaking bipolar creepy stalker. He is totally unrealistic his a young attractive billionaire that's a humanitarian, well endowed and can have any women on the planet and he picks this confused scary chick GTHO. I find it hard to connect with a twenty-one yr old virgin that decides for her first sexual encounter to engage in this type of freakness and further more the streaming scenes were so laughable that I could not take this book seriously. Save your time and money.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Moves quickly.  I was always wanting to see what's gonna' happen next .  Reacher is a super-hero without seemingly intending to be.  Good read.  Looking forward to reading the next one.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I tried to do a simple google search using this app with little success. I am not sure what this app is good for if it does not facilitate  simple key word searches. I haven't explored all the categories listed in the app, but if I can't do a simple word search without an instruction manual it is obviously too sophisticated for me. I will delete this and look for a more functional search engine app.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for my boys to watch in the car on the way to our holiday vacation.  They (9ys and 11yrs) loved it, it kept them busy for part of the drive.  They watched it on the way back and at home since then.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|Takes the &#34;Forever War&#34; and stands it on it's head.  I enjoyed it as a guy who's entering my middle age.  The writing was okay and the premise was interesting.  I'll definitely read the next ones on the series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is amazing app and I don't believe it gets any better than this!!! I've just downloaded and have  only just begun to really look into it but I just can't get over how great an application this is ESP. and regardless of the fact that it's free it's just simply amazing how in-depth and accurate and how much it shows and tells you!!! The only thing I would ask and it may have this, as I've yet to discover all that it does, but I would love if it would show on the status bar what the temp. etc. is... But I'm discovering that the kindle fire HD has limits and some issues that I'm having trouble with but that's nothing to do with this, but as far as this app goes I would recommend this and sing it's praises to anyone who asks and any of my friends and family!!!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter to play on my phone when we are out. She enjoys playing the game very much. The only thing that I do not like about the game is that to do anything you have to buy everything. This game is meant for kids then there should be more free content for them to play.
B008OIQYTG|3.0|I bought this album because of Ritenour's connection to Fourplay. It's a good album, but not as orchestrally full and rich as the Fourplay sound that I am so fond of.

B0058EBNAO|1.0|10/12/2016  I have updated this app from 5 stars to 1 star and DO NOT RECOMMEND.  After having great difficulty with Amazon Customer Service regarding applications for my Kindle Fire, I would not recommend ANY app from Amazon.  I would recommend this app on your Android phone purchased from somewhere else.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />I read the reviews and thought that this would be a nice application for my Kindle Fire HD.  Wow, I mean Holy Crap this is very nice and advanced too!  Whoever put this together knows what they are doing!  It would seem there are so many junk applications out there, this one is worth every penny!<br /><br />1) Its very comprehensive!  It has a very nice main screen that makes it easy to get a forecast for the day.<br />2) It has a very nice radar application.  A national weather radar map is very difficult to find, this one has that<br />3) Earthquake data.  Now you don't need to miss a beat if you thought you felt something, you can quickly find out if it was an earthquake.<br /><br />Its basically got everything you would ever need!  If you thought about getting your own weather station and mounting it on your house, forget about it!  This is better!<br /><br />**** UPDATE  *****<br /><br />5/7/13  Still the best weather app on the planet!  I use it everyday and have now put this app on my Android phone as well as my Kindle Fire HD.
B000SINT52|5.0|I am a collector of Michael Moore's documentaries but I try to keep my ratings unbiased.  Moore has made some great movies and some not so outstanding.  This one is seminal.
B003QO4BNO|5.0|This is an awesome episode in season 1 where they go to Regionals and Quinn has her child. You find out if she keeps it or gives it away, and if they win Regionals. It is a great ending to season 1 and wraps up all of the story lines. It is an amazing episode but I would concider buy the whole season because if you just buy this episode without watching the others you would have no idea what the heck was going on. Although if you saw the rest of the season and not this one, BUY IT!!!

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper was a cool sci-fi action movie that definitely entertains, but it's not going to win any awards.  It's a good rental and I don't regret the purchase.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really liked this book.  I've enjoyed all the Jack Reacher stories I've read so far, even though they do get quite graphically violent.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This movie is incredible. I loved the 1st season. 2nd Season was Amazing. Can't wait for the 3rd seasons movies. I was kind of disappointed that there was only 1 episode on the 4th disc but it's definitely a series you never want to stop watching.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Beautiful. One of the best books I've ever read! If your looking for a touching story this is a good choice!
B008VBYN80|2.0|Pros:<br />1.  The graphics are beautiful.<br />2.  Great zoom feature.<br />3.  Quests help guide you and explain the game.<br />4.  Lisa (quest helper) has some humor.<br />5.  Cute soundtrack.<br />6.  Gameloft puts in live events that last for a limited amount of time. For example: pirates battles, player tournaments, and seasonal decorations. Game can be played (very very very sloooooowly) for free.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The game forces you to \\"friend\\" other's kingdoms through Gameloft Live or Facebook (There are quests that specifically require this.) Unfortunately the log in is buggy and does not work much of the time. Most of the time you cannot visit friend's kingdoms due to a bug. Logging in to the player tournaments is often an exercise in frustration for the same reason.<br />2.  To play it as a game at even a slow pace, you MUST buy diamonds. LOTS of diamonds. They quickly become expensive. $4.99 for 40 Diamonds at the Gameloft Store.<br />3.  Diamonds are required to purchase better units for combat. But if a diamond bought unit dies in combat, you get one chance immediately after the battle to buy it back for 1/2 to 3/4ths the cost in diamonds of the original cost, or lose it forever. For example:  28 Diamond Master Archer dies, to get him back costs 23 Diamonds.<br />4.  Energy is required to harvest, build buildings, chop down trees, collect taxes and stage attacks on enemies. However it regens very slowly, one every 2 and a half minutes or so. And energy is capped based on level.  So you can only have up to a certain amount. Once you use it all, and you will in about a minute, you must wait or buy more.  Diamonds are required to purchase more \\"energy\\": 5 Energy for 5 Diamonds. Again, crazy expensive to keep buying energy so that you can actually make the game play at a decent pace.<br />5.  Many quests require you to build structures bought with diamonds: Small Tent for 14 Diamonds, Belvedere for 20 Diamonds, Advanced Training Academy 60 Diamonds, etc. Just to build the structures for these three quests will cost you over $10.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />It makes me sad because I really wanted to like this game. The graphics are beautiful. There is a storyline.  But the game is just too expensive and slow. It would cost an easy $100 and up to truly make this game move at a reasonable pace and to make it enjoyable.  I recommend Kairosoft's Dungeon Village, Kairobotica and Beastie Bay instead. $4.99 per game and done =D
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Lots of action, suspense, and great ideas. Love this series! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

B008XBASVY|5.0|Oh. My. Gosh. <----- that was my reaction after reading this book.  I'm a huge Glee and Chris colfer fan, so that's pretty much the only reason I read it. I could NOT put it Down, I laughed (ALOT) and cried. I HIGHLY recommended it.(:
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it helps me stay in the word every day. I really like the bookmarks and how organized they keep me between my different daily devotionals. I also like how readily available all of the different versions of the bible are in this app. While it's not its primary use, comparing the different references is made quite simple with this app.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book has honesty opened my eyes. I now know not to take life for granted because you never know when it can all be taken away. I have been through a lot in my life but nothing this extreme. Jacyee Dugard is a very strong and courageous woman. I recommend this book to everyone ages 13 and up. Some parts may be disturbing to some readers however because her abductors did some terrible and unforgivable things that were hard for me to read. Over all a wonderful book with a strong message to never give up hope and never take life for granted.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works like you would expect, good graphics and is free.  Thanks for exceeding expectations. I would recommend this application for use on Fire HD.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app is awesome. I got a kindle fire for Christmas and I was surprised poo erosion exited because my cousins have one and they have Jetpack Joyride as so as soon as possible I got it and now I play it every day. What sucks is that my mom put parental controls on it so that I can only be on apps 30 minutes a day. So anyway this app is awesome and you should download it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Beautifully developed characters and an enjoyable story. And I enjoyed that the reason for the title isn't revealed until the very end.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is awesome. It is challenging and once you start playing it you can't stop. It is a great way to waste time. Angry birds is awesome. You should download this app right now or any other as angry birds game for that matter.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|Directed by Steven Spielberg, this is one of the funniest movies ever.  Tom Hanks, just starting out has a chance to demonstrate his talent for comedy, slapstick, and dialogue timing.  Whenever you're feeling low just pull this one out and watch it again for an elevated mood changer.

B008FRFN7A|1.0|Dont waste the time to download. Dosent really print! Too many issues with compatability. I used Apples basic print format.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this show!!  I have watched it several times.  I got hooked while on deployment and have been a huge fan since!!<br /><br />The Good:  It is an amazing story and you want more<br /><br />The Bad: Just want more<br /><br />Overall:  Must Buy
B009GX6SSK|5.0|But it is still very good. There is not much on TV these days worth watching so I treasure the ones that are.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great movie - Lot's of fun. It's apparent that all these very experienced actors had a good time making it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love this series and movie, even if the movie included some events that can't be undone... making future stories hard to do.  But that's treading into spoiler territory.  So I'll just say again: this is the best writing, acting, and production of any television series or movie.  The characters are so engaging that I didn't become attached to one or two, but all of the main characters (9 of them, or 10 if you include the ship...), and even some of the supporting characters.  The setting is definitely science fiction, but I think it's the most accessible sci fi setting in fiction.  A couple friends of mine, a married couple, are not geeks (unlike me) and are usually more interested in sports and so forth than anything that could be described as sci fi.  I introduced them to the show, and they loved it.  And then they were mad at me for showing them such excellence that ends.  Which brings me to something important...<br /><br />I hate Fox Broadcasting Company.  Such ignorant pieces of crap must work there.  They cancelled this show after one season.  Stupid Fox.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't possibly give this series enough glowing praise.  Watch it.  Enjoy.
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|The app is great and works fine on the note 2 except that the controls are all messed up. I have set my phone to 220 dpi, and all is perfect. So the app would work at the normal 320 dpi if Adobe would program the ui for it.
B005LAII8K|4.0|... I like this movie.  It was a fun story that engaged my logical mind as I thought about whether I agreed with what they considered the consequences to be of changes to what happened in the time line.  The action keeps up enough to keep attention, and the two versions of the main character are unpleasant enough to make a viewer dislike them at first, and give them room to grow.  It was a nice character progression, and it's a fun movie worth a look.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|I think this is a great setup for a new Bourne trilogy or more. Jeremy Renner makes a great Bourne mate.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact was thought provoking, and a page turner. The characters were believeable  Their reactions to events were what normal people would do.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I enjoyed the story, the acting, and all the guns. The time travel aspect was interesting too. I saw this in the theater and was impressed with it. Nice acting by Willis and Levitt. They really made him look like a younger Bruce. I hope the special features includes something on the makeup process. Now I want a sawed off shotgun :) Recommended
0061992860|3.0|This thing is really small but thick. Kind of heavy too. Bring your reading glasses if your over forty the print is small also.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was OK as an action movie goes but it wasn't a Bourne movie! Get back to the original and I will continue being a fan!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so easy to use for all in the family...from the 6 year to the 37 year old.<br />Bummer that I can not get it on my Droid Bionic Phone..: (
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two is better than one,if you can believe that!  Totally engrossing!  I have been kidnapped for one hell of a rollercoaster ride!  Onto the final book!  Woo Hop!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is really fast and I have to do everything quickly but thats  point the point rihgt .that is why I like this game
B00AW735QC|5.0|This show is the best s*** I have ever seen from Ryan Murphy. Keep up the good work, good writing and excellent acting. I LOVE YOU JESSICA LANGE!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  I would recommend this to anyone that has been in an abusive situation as Jaycee describes how she survived.  She is a remarkable person.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Cool NICE informative heavenly 100% I would rate it like this because it was the same thing as the children one I would not recommend it XD
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a gift I bought for Christmas.  Seemed like a good value for the price.  Was a hit with my brother.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the game, there fun and enjoyable. its a good challenge to play and try to open all the game's, I will try and see how long it takes me!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I found this movie a little disgusting and the thought of a filthy mouth teddy bear beyond the boundries of acceptable entertainment. Mark Wahlberg could have passed on this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app a lot. I have family living in other States and / or. counties and it is easy to go from one location to another. This way I keep up with weather were friends and family lives also.
B009CPE424|4.0|Good for the entire family. Fun for all and George Lopez does a wonderful job as a  chihuahua. Cute dogs and a great cast.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Awesome album. Not a bad song on it.  Would recommend to anyone.  If you enjoy Dave Matthews, you'll like this guy!
B008Y2X78S|5.0|I cant wait to buy the 3 rd season. its addicting and very entertaining. I highly recommend it to 18 and over only.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|ACA AWESOME MOVIE!!!! I was totally taken back by the fact that Anna Kendrick can sing! I totally loved the chemistry between her and Britanny Snow!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Looking for answers and just finding more questions.Left feeling I wasted too much time reading this book.Would not recommend it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is the real deal here! Unlike so many of the game apps for the Kindle fire THIS ONE is an actual PC game converted for the Kindle fire. Everything is perfect from the graphics to the game play. No lock ups or force close problems. Simple yet interesting story concept with just a tiny bit of history thrown in as well. Worth EVERY penny of the $4.99 and then some! Why oh why are there not more games of this quality for the Kindle?!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good graphics and worth buying for 2.99. mini games were good and story line was good. would buy the next in the series.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|We got our son the Kindle Fire for Christmas, and he really wanted this game. He loves the way the Star Wars characters and the birds have come together. Lots of fun!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|After hearing so many good things about this book, I expected it to be something truly moving and poignant. Unfortunately, it just missed all the marks. My biggest question is: How can a book dealing with abuse, drugs, alcohol, sexuality, rape and suicide feel so completely stale?<br />These are some pretty serious themes that the narrator is discussing. But he deals with everything so casually, as if he were talking about changing his hairstyle. Let me give you a few examples of how the author deals with a few of these issues...<br />\\"I was smoking quite a bit, but I decided to stop, so I did. No problem.\\"<br />\\"My only friend in the whole world killed himself. I only mention this in passing, because it didn't really bother me that much.\\"<br />\\"I am 16 years old, and I regularly do drugs with a grad student. This has no affect on my grades or personal relationships whatsoever.\\"<br />\\"My sister was impregnated by her abusive boyfriend. Then she had an abortion. But she ALSO was not affected by these things in ANY way.\\"<br />Charlie (the narrator) comes across as more mentally handicapped than disturbed. He seems to be incapable of feeling any emotion. Although he does EXPRESS emotion by crying almost constantly, he never seems aware of having any actual \\"feelings.\\" Oh, I'm sorry... does feeling \\"infinite\\" count? And how, exactly does he know that he is feeling \\"infinite\\", when he doesn't have any sense of ever feeling jealous, angry, hurt, excited, or even disappointed? Apparently, he is just too nice to have emotions.<br />I guess the bottom line for me is that this book had a whole lot of teen tragedy, but absolutely no heart. I can't connect to something so mind-numbingly flat.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son is a huge Star Wars fan, as well as a huge fan of Legos. He has so much fun opening up a new character or ship, etc. every day during December. He plays with the whole set now that the holidays are over.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Mira's story Waking Up Married was a refreshing and fun read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining quick read. I will definitely look up more of Mira's book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Fantastic, can't wait for the next one. I really hope these sums a beoches are ready for winter cause it's on.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|it took too long to download and install into my kindle fire and isn't that great anyway. I wasn't impressed at all
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love how thire is so meny dragons and I thank it's cool and I love that fire dragon- it's cool
B005S9EKCW|5.0|\\"Les Miserables\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Ex-prisoner Jean Valjean is hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman Javert after he breaks parole. When Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's young daughter, Cosette, their lives change forever.<br /><br />The cast led by Hugh Jackman (superb as Jean Valjean), Russell Crowe (solid as Javert), Anne Hathaway (Oscar-worthy / winning excellence as Fantine), Amanda Seyfried (solid as Cosette), Sacha Baron Cohen (as Thenardier), Helena Bonham Carter (as Madame Thenardier) & Eddie Redmayne (as Marius) is great. The directing by Tom Hooper is great. The screenplay (based on the novel by Victor Hugo & the musical play by Claude-Michel Schonberg & Alain Boublil) by William Nicholson is great.<br /><br />The cinematography by Danny Cohen is great. The film editing by Chris Dickens & Melanie Oliver is great. The casting by Nina Gold is great. The production design by Eve Stewart is great. The art direction by Grant Armstrong, Gary Jopling, Hannah Moseley & Su Whitaker is great. The set decoration by John Botton, Leigh Bryant, Stephen Doyle (also did the set dressings), Billy Edwards, Carrie Garner, James Hendy, Anna Lynch-Robinson, Sarah Whittle & Matt Wyles is great. The costume design by Paco Delgado is great. The special effects supervised by Mark Holt is great. The visual effects supervised by Richard Bain, Sara Bennett, John Lockwood, Sean Mathiesen, Nathan McGuinness & Steve Street, coordinated by Kingsley Cook, Izzy Field, Alex Fitzgerald, Ali Ingham, Allison Paul, Natalie Reid & Adrian Steel is great. The stunts coordinated by Paul Herbert is great.<br /><br />This is a well-acted and well-done adaptation that is entertaining and well-crafted. The cast is terrific in singing their songs, well-sung and well-crafted. Tom Hooper has done a terrific follow-up movie to his Oscar-winning masterpiece, \\"The King's Speech\\" (2010), that is definitely a different movie and also an interesting movie to do, interms of, Oscar-winning follow-up films. Hugh Jackman is in a definitely superb performance as Jean Valjean, his first time singing in a movie or movie musical adaptation, among the Oscar-worthy/winning excellence of Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine & Russell Crowe's solidly-crafted work as Javert, both Hathaway & Crowe also singing for the first time on screen in a movie musical adaptation. This is one of the best films of last year and also of the recently-done holiday season, which was also, definitely, one of the most anticipated films of last year. This is also one of the better movie musicals done in recent memory.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|It isn't a free game it's a sample of their product. Rather than just state that up front they opted for a weird drug dealer marketing strategy. I'm not addicted enough to pay the $2.99.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved it and could not put it down! I was surprised that E.L. James was able to keep the attention of the reader and maintain the allure of the relationship between Ana and Christian. I was very impressed.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|I think i wore it out listening so much!!!! Great CD, has a lot of the good stuff we all know and love
B00899F0G8|5.0|The characters are well developed and the plot lines keep one coming back each week to see the new developments.  While the plotlines stray from the books, it is interesting the different way in which the show has spun.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I  unsure as to why this app and amazon mp3 is not geared to download to kindle fire. amazon and google are the main contributors to the apps I have on my android AND kindle fire yet there is no app,or seems to b no app where I can download and easily go to amazon or the play store for kindle. it keeps saying \\"not compatible\\" for kindle fire but available instantly for my razor/ android.very frustrating please fix this ...otherwise is a great app... that's why I give it a 3 1/2 (but I round up)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was still a great closing book for the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, although I found it more lackluster than the original two books in the trilogy.
B006Z7Z3R2|3.0|The Main two characters are casual and almost Brother-Sister like.  In some scenes, it may be cutsey, in others,...somewhat out of place. This story is too slow to build up, and by the time it finally does, you find the ending was hardly worth waiting for.  Anyone giving this movie more than 3 out of 5 stars, is either unfamiliar with better quality scare movies, or has very low expectations for this genre,...or is a shill reviewer.  I have a very large collection of movies, over 1000 in the Horror genre alone, so, trust me when I say this movie is weak, and drags on with no payoff in the end.  If you ar looking for a onetime movie to fill in an evening, and can buy this movie for under 10 bucks, go for it.  But, you probably won't see a desire to watch it more than once.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I am very happy with my Kindle Zip Sleeve. It is a nice color, and it has been a life saver when I want to store my Kindle and take it with me everywhere.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Don't watch it unless you are desperate and really sick of the food network. Sorry but you just can't keep doing this over and over there was absolutly nothing original in this movie.  Can't think of anyone to recomend it to, it would be unkind.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I was looking for an app that would show the battery icon in the menu with a percentage of power left and also show when the Kindle is charging, and when a full charge is reached. This does none of those things.  It will give you that info, but only after you have opened the app each time and check it. Disappointed that something so basic in an app cannot be done on the Kindle. It did not appear that any of the other battery apps were any better. If I've missed something, PLEASE let me know.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Hollywood is seriously out of ideas, its all about merchandizing, not making a quality film.  These people are making movies from video games for pete sakes there are no fresh ideas coming out of Hollywood.  Good movie for the under ten crowd.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great fun saving the rebels from the evil empire. The whole family likes playing this game. Really like the gravity effects.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|The title says it all, I mean how desperate are you for a movie plot, the animated version was better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun game!  Be careful, it's a hard one to put down! I have it on my phone and ipad.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Mildly entertaining same old story line all so predictable.  No recomendations.  Ok if there is absolutly nothing on the food network.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love Bill Nihey and Judi Densch. And as a retired woman trying to find some financial help, this movie relates to my thinking. I'm not about to go to India, but it's an interesting alternative lifestyle. Perhaps I should go to India!
B00APUQRPC|2.0|How many times can this senario be used?  It's pathetic, a waste of time and whatever else can be said about a bad movie.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|My daughter downloaded this game and she loves it. Good effects and action ability.  The colors pop off of the screen and it really reminds you of the original cartoon.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app. really compliments the Kindle Fire, great ease of use and I would recommend the Facebook app. to all Kindle Fire users.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great ending to the series. Gives thought to how the media and government can be used to manipulate societies and how it is important to remain one's self morally through it all.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I enjoyed these short stories about Detective Harry Bosch. They provided some insight into some of his previous cases. I recommend them to any Bosch fans.

1594744769|3.0|As a child, Jacob Portman delighted in his grandfather's fantastical - yet supposedly autobiographical - stories. Abraham claimed to have lived a rather extraordinary life that began during World War II, when his parents sent him to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. A magical orphanage-slash-boarding school located on a faraway Welsh island, the home was inhabited by a motley crew of children possessing supernatural powers. A girl who could levitate, a boy who burped bees, and human-faced dog (as opposed to a dog-faced boy, I suppose) - these were but a few of the home's unusual residents. Abe's contribution? Why, he battled monsters, of course!<br /><br />Now 16, Jacob recognizes the stories as fiction - at best, fairy tales meant to entertain a child; at worst, a kind of practical joke that hinged on his naivety and willingness to believe. (More astute readers may also identify Abe's tales as allegories for the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. Abe's family - both of them - were decimated during the war.) That is, until his grandfather dies suddenly and under mysteriously circumstances. Abe's last words to his grandson set Jake on a path that will eventually carry him to the island of Cairnholm - and to Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children.<br /><br />The highlight of MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN is, without a doubt, the photographs. Riggs weaves the story around forty-four oddball vintage photographs, culled from the archives of ten collectors (including that of the author himself). The result is both arresting and charming; while the photographs merge seamlessly with the plot, you'll find yourself wondering about the true context of each. (Some historical background would've been awesome, but likely there's little information to be had - the appendix notes that many of the photos were rescued from \\"giant bins of unsorted snapshots at flea markets and antiques malls and yard sales.\\") Many of the subjects look as though they'd be at home in a David Lynch project. Twins in ruffled collars, I'm looking at you!<br /><br />- Minor spoilers follow! -<br /><br />The story is enjoyable enough, though as far as young adult fiction goes, the writing isn't as sophisticated as some of my genre favorites. (It's more on par with Harry Potter vs. THE HUNGER GAMES.) The story starts out slow but gradually builds steam; the last third of the book is especially action-packed and engaging. The imperfect people and occasionally dysfunctional relationships are another strong point; many readers will recognize a friend or loved one (or perhaps even themselves) in Jacob's self-defeating father, and Emma's bittersweet romance with Abe will leave your heart breaking for her - while also emphasizing with Abe for doing what he had to do to stay true to himself.<br /><br />Additionally, the time travel part of the plot is both entertaining and raises a number of interesting questions - some of which are bound to be lost on younger readers and thus most likely won't be addressed in the sequel(s) (e.g., what does the 82-year age gap say about Emma and Jacob's relationship?).<br /><br />On the downside, I was disappointed by the occasional ableist (\\"Special Ed\\"), classist (\\"redneck\\"), and sexist (\\"sissy\\" or \\"nancy boy,\\" I can't quite remember which) language, which was wholly unnecessary and did nothing to further the story.<br /><br />While I'll definitely check out the sequel - which is anticipated in the spring of 2013 - it probably won't go to the top of my book pile. I may, however, hit a few flea markets myself this summer.be at home in a David Lynch project.

0393312836|1.0|I know it's incredibly popular and I have a handful of friends who loved this book. Half of the words are made up, but after a couple pages you catch on and have most of the new &#34;slang&#34; terms figured out. I just didn't like how violent (and to me, pointless) the plot was. I couldn't see any good in the book or the main characters. After a violent rape scene, I decided I was done. Anarchy without reason or purpose just doesn't create a page-turner of a book for me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What a time waster.<br />But,.............boy what fun.<br />Many hours spend with the birds.<br />This one is for my new tablet, already pass level 10<br /><br />daboss
0439023521|5.0|Liked this whole series, but this was my favorite of the 3. Great teen / young adult novel. Decent plot and characters and definitely keeps you interested to keep reading. I think I read all 3 over a long weekend. Liked the strong female lead, even if she doesn't know how to deal with boys.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|No book could ever prove it to me.<br />The day I die.........still won,t know, cause I be going to hell.<br /><br />daboss
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not as good as volume 1 of the trilogy.  I will be very interested in finding out who will play Christian and Ana in the movie.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Great flick for all. Especially if your an mma fan. Worth two hours of my life.You won't regret this one.
1878424319|5.0|Each time I read this book I get something new out of it. A must-have for anyone on a spiritual quest for harmony.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The movie was okay.  Maybe Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones just make it look easy.  The actors did as much as they could with the script they were given.  Entertaining enough for one time, but I would not buy the movie.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is so cute and fun. Excellent time waster. Please create more levels and more pudding monsters! I recommend this game for everyone
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My favorite series ... great plots, but it's the character interaction that really makes the show. I've been watching NCIS since season 1 and will continue watching it!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|i love Patricia Cornwell's work.  They are very interesting.  they are easy to follow, some medical based book can get confessing.

B0095R6OBS|4.0|I bought this movie thinking it was the new version of the movie but I just fooled myself. It is in black and white andIt is real life characters not a cartoon. I loved the story however and enjoyed every minute of it. Very entertaining.

B008EQIEWS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It is very entertaining and is full of action. Im a girl and I found this movie to be very good. If you like fantasy action and an adventure full of loss and gain you will like this movie.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|This story of multiple types of love and attraction, is appealing to people in various stages of life and love. It also works as a light comedy, holiday movie, and even a tribute to old Hollywood films.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|MY kindle's weakness is it's power cord does not always seat properly.  This app saves me from guessing if it's recharging or not.  The display is big and clear.  The functionality is exactly what it should be.
B00008RH3L|5.0|the product is fine. it's a DVD. simply made, easy to watch.<br />if you want a film review this is classic Coen brothers!  Every frame is meticulously thought out.  Having watched this movie dozens of times, i still see things i have not noticed before. These filmmakers are superb in their writing and direction. A true masterpiece.  Beautiful cinematography and excellent attention to details in the set design. Plot is carefully woven and executed in perfect timing.<br />And the acting! Such character portrayals- each one  a distinct and precise unforgettable image. I marvel at the ability of the actors to maintain the exact emotion the scene requires.  Truly all gifted performances. You owe it to yourself to see this film and add it to your collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was surprised the whole way through.  This is a great book can't wait to read the final book of the series.
0439023483|5.0|I had bought a paper back edition from a big name book store for twice the price and lent it to a friend... it got destroyed (being paperback in the hands of a mad woman lol). So I was very pleased to find this hardback edition for half the price!! I love hard back books and am grateful to find it so cheap and shipping efficient. If I didn't already have the other books, I'd certainly shop with Amazon first.
B003VXPIXW|5.0|This is the anniversary edition, and was exactly what I had hoped for.  A classic for preschoolers. Thank you so much.
1451695195|5.0|As a real skeptic and a medical professional, I found it fascinating and incredibly affirming and encouraging....even thrilling!  Love the concept of continued growth beyond this physical existence!
B009A87X80|5.0|Discovered Eva a few years ago and her sad story, but what a voice.  If she would have lived, she would have been a major star.  Still think she out sings  Judy Garland with her rendition of over the rainbow!
B008XG1X18|1.0|On two different occasions I've tried to become a member.  It keeps rejecting either my name and/or password (and I know they're correct) and when I try clicking &#34;I forgot&#34;, instead of sending me the information, it makes me go through the whole process of signing up again.
0812984412|1.0|Couldn't even get into it.  Strange, confusing and not entertaining.  I gave it away without trying to get into it.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|For those with heavy doses of testosterone flowing through your veins, this watch is for you!  I normally destroy watches within a month or two.  Not this ticker; it truly takes a licking but keeps on ticking.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it helps me with my homework all the time if I don't get a answer right I use this app and for a 9 year old that is pretty awesome
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Bought this for my grand daughter (5 y.o.) she loves watching Ice Age when she comes over (she comes over a lot). We sat down and watched the movie with her and it was a real fun movie to watch. We don't have a 3D TV (yet) so I can't really comment on that. We own all the Ice Age movies and we enjoy all of them.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My grand daughter really enjoys this My Little Pony. She says it is so much fun. Maw maw lets do it together
B00AX010PQ|2.0|I love the Sherlock Holmes canon and have enjoyed Elementary so far, but the show jumps the shark in this episode. A dead hotel manager ends up in a washing machine. She turns out to be a spy, along with her husband and a friend who runs a landmine non-profit. Her daughter, a seventeen year old soccer player and recovering pain pill addict, gets caught up in the mess. It's a disaster of a turn for Elementary--too much packed into 45 minutes, too glibly.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was an awesome deal!  I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it.  I know some of the reviews said they got two copies of the same movie and were missing one, but out pack that we got had everything it was supposed to have.  Very satisfied and would definitely recommend.
B000V6583C|5.0|This is one of those rare rock albums with great songs that don't all sound the same.  You can just press play on this one from start to finish for a solid rock fix.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|I liked the movie which is why I decided to purchase it.  No problems with it at all.  Correct item came.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys (ages 6 and 9) love this game.  I hesitated purchasing this because of the price, but it has been worth every penny.  They play this game more than any of the other apps.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I really like this movie.  I used it for our Christmas gift exchange and other people liked it as well.  Product came as described, no complaints here!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Fast paced and unexpected. Not typically my favorite type of book with the science fiction, but now it is.  I'm onto the next one!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a Fun game that gets your brain moving and  works great . No problems running the app and my kids love it
B00004TS0E|5.0|My grandmother bought this for me when I was a kid on VHS. As an adult now I bought it on DVD. When it first came there was glue on the disc. However great customer service from Amazon rectified that and sent me a replacement. The replacement was fine, no defects. This picture is so crisp and clear. I'm so happy I have this on DVD, as the image is much better. The movie itself is wonderful. I do have to say I had watched the original earlier [[ASIN:B003CSV7TK Miracle on 34th Street (1947)]] and I prefer the original to this new one. A good movie either way though as it's important for adults and children to still believe and have faith in things.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a great movie if you love music and this type of singing.  Loved the comedy and the acting.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|When I first received this movie there was some problems with the DVD, but Amazon made good with it and replaced it. But when I was able to finally watch this I was so pleasantly surprised. I love this so much more than the remake!! Boy have I been missing out!! I love Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara. Great acting by the entire cast. I was so surprised to see William Frawley (the actor who played Fred Mertz from I Love Lucy) in this. When I have a family of my own, I can't wait to share this with them. This will definitely be a must watch for Christmas time when I have kids. It's important for adults and children to still believe and have faith in things.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great bible app I recommed this bible to everyone who really search the scriptures. There many option that wlll enable you to do just that. As well as a yearly bible reading plans.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Tender,  honest, searing, brutal,  perceptive....an exceptional look into the inner world of a troubled teen. I was captivated by this character's voice, and the journey he takes beyond fear.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Best of the best of firsts or should I say first of forever? I could not put the book down. The love. The heartache. The tragedy. The strength. I would definitely reread.
1400079144|5.0|This was a very good book.  I loved it and read it very fast.  Could not put it down. Service and reading matter was just perfect.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|While not spectacular in terms of sophistication, the game is quite intuitive and varied. It has ease of use for the beginner and enough interesting configurations to hold a more experienced player.
B005HSL626|5.0|So much fun and the kid can't put it down.the best party it was free for the kindle! A must have game!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Who wouldn't love a set of Indy?  Of course the one that takes place in India isn't my favorite, but the others!!  If you're an Indian Jones fan, it's something you want to have
B004EPYZPS|2.0|This movie would have been so much better without the cursing. J. J. Abrams has children. Does he really think middle school kids curse this much. I watched this film with my 12 and 13 year olds and they were disturbed by the language. I did not appreciate it either. Did Abrams think it was funny to have so much of it? What was the point? Maybe the people in charge are used to adult situations and can't put themselves in a kids shoes. If you are a parent and you don't like your kids to hear a ton of language(especially from other children) in a \\"family friendly movie\\", then do not watch this one.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have been a fan of the Scarpetta series since I picked up my first one. Now have read each and everyone and each one can both stand alone, or be read either in order or out of order. Always surprises abound and satisfaction comes at the end. Great series and highly recommended to all who enjoy this type of book!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This was a good game. I very much enjoy the point and click without the hidden objects.  I wish I could find more like this one.  I only gave it 4 stars because the game worked very well but it could have been a little longer and a bit more difficult.  it was a little too easy to win the game
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I give it 5 stars because I find it to be a good mix of likable ballads and upbeat tunes, making it easy to listen too multiple times. There are a number of really good songs, and others that are good.  It's not too often I find an album where I can listen to all the songs and not want to skip over any of them - this is one of those albums.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens next!  Book two was almost as good as book one! I was worried it wouldn't be as exciting. I'm glad it was!!!
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I always liked Kelly Clarkson, and most of her hit songs, but not her albums.  This collection contains all her hits and a few I consider misses, plus a holiday song that shouldn't be on a Greatest Hits album.  Still, for someone who likes most of her music, this is a very good collection to own.
B004JQN364|5.0|This dragon man is epic! His mouth opens and he has a very detailed tounge XD he has a sword you can remove from his hand (or claws idk)
B0026P3G12|5.0|My mom has dementia and Susan Boyle's music is very soothing for her. She listens to it quite often and seem happy and content!
B005GHN2GG|5.0|the Master of Crows had just the right mix of action to balance the romance.  There was enough magic to keep the story entertaining.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|This new Kindle comes with a camera that you can't  use without PURCHASING the camera app for ¢0. 99.  It should have been already equipped.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. I love how detailed it is. And at the end it took me a minute to figure out. But i cant wait to read more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is great.  I use it almost daily for budgeting for grocery shopping and paying bill and I have noticed no problems.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The product is great, exactly as described by Amazon.<br />The movie quality is good and I got the concept art book which I wanted.<br />Besides, good price... excellent purchase. Recommended to all Bat fans.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|My boyfriend is into history and he absolutely loved this movie. It's a great movie for a guy, for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and see on smaller screens.  I use this app more often than any other calculater.  Highly recommended.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend, but I also enjoyed watching it with him. Absolutely hilarious and a must see.
B002BY77CW|5.0|As always Lauren Conrad NEVER disappoints. If you loved Laguna Beach and The Hills this series is for you! It takes you inside the \\"reality\\" of reality shows. What seems real is not always true.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Once I started listening to Incognito, it became a habit!  Every album they make is better than the one before it, if you can believe THAT'S possible!  Not regreting this purchase one tiny little bit. Mo Brandis really shows his range in his vocals on  Don't Wanna Know and on my personal favorite, Goodbye To Yesterday. His style is new, original and flawless :) Keep them coming!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Excellent book. Great development of plot. Difficult to put down without finishing. Even better read than Fifty Shades of Grey.
0425263916|5.0|Gideon Cross is a dominant alpha male. He takes his life by the reigns and he's used to getting everything that he desires.  There is nothing he wants more than to possess his beautiful Eva but between them they have enough problems to derail the finest train.  However, both Eva and Gideon are desperate to hang on to what they have together.  Will Gideon and Eva find their happily-ever-after or will the obstacles between them become greater and drive them apart forever?<br /><br />The second book in the Crossfire series, Reflected In You picks up where Bared To You left off.  If you can't handle hot sex, sublime emotion and superb writing then I suggest you hunt for something else because Sylvia Day's Reflected In You surpasses this reviewer's expectations in each category. It was hard for me to imagine a book bringing as much raw emotion and depth as Bared To You did but Ms. Day slays the erotic genre with her original characters and candid emotions in Reflected In You.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva may be messed up emotionally but they both know that together they are stronger. Unfortunately, the demons of their pasts keep surfacing, attempting to tear them apart. I so love this couple! Their intensity and passion make me ache for them.  I want so badly for them to be able to work through the traumas of their past and present to find peace.  But we all know nothing comes for free and Gideon and Eva learn the hard way that they will have to work for what they truly desire.<br /><br />There has never been a couple that affected me like Gideon and Eva.  Ms. Day brings magic to the pages with this couple.  Reflected In You forces the couple to face some terrible truths and it also shines a light on the dark side of the human psyche.  We all change when we enter relationships especially the ones that last.  Sometimes we have trouble controlling our baser instincts such as jealousy and paranoia. I think Ms. Day does an excellent job of displaying a human most basic emotional makeup.  The truth is some of us handle our feelings better than others.  Gideon and Eva explore the darker side of relationships; the side that most of us don't like to look at but that doesn't mean it's not there.  I've said it before and I'll say it again. The honesty of the Crossfire series characters is unparalleled. The good, bad, beautiful and ugly are all on display as Gideon and Eva struggle to find themselves as individuals and as a couple in Reflected In You.  Gideon and Eva admit that certain things about them are messed up and they are attempting to fix them. It's hard but it's their drive to change themselves for happiness that really sets this couple apart.<br /><br />While I wait impatiently for book three in the Crossfire series I hope that many readers find their way to the store to add Reflected In You to their must read list because it shouldn't be missed.  If we had a star system here at Joyfully Reviewed Reflected In You would absolutely be a TEN!  We don't do stars here. We do recommendations and that is why I am Joyfully Recommending Reflected In You for November!<br /><br />Miranda for Joyfully Reviewedl makeup.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I could not put it down. Read it in two days..
B003L1ZXCU|4.0|The only thing negative is that the book does not END at the end, but continues to the next book.<br /><br />If you know that going in, it would be 5 stars :)
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really great!! It's challenging, but not too challenging, it enthralls you! It's great! It has this certain &quot;scary&quot; element because hey, your running from evil monkeys! Plus you can't fall, whack you head off (haha!), etc!! It's a great game and I recommend it! Thank you for making this game!!!!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|My grandson (8) loved this blaster.  It was easy to use and seemed sturdy enough.  This was lots of fun to use.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Loved the movie! Unexpected (to me) plot twist that made it very interesting. Violent, but understandably so. Theme of &#34;predetermined fate&#34; is very interesting.
B003UESJJC|5.0|A Very good movie, well dispatched in time. The blu ray box bore few bumps on each sides certainly because of the handling
B003DF4582|5.0|needed to upgrade to digital format from video of our families old time favorites! Knight's Tale with Heath Ledger is brilliant for laughter.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|At times it was difficult to wrap your mind around this...as all time travel books and movies are (to me).  But it is a great read and while I had never read anything by Stephen King before, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is awesome soooooo addicting!!I'm spool happy it came from I tunes onto amazon!!!This game everyone needs to get!!!:)
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Thick blade, full tang, grippy handle, blade holds an edge well.  I oil the edge to keep it from rusting.  Not too short, not too long, just right.  I like this knife.  Solid knife that does the job.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put this book down. I just had to keep reading to find out what would happen next.  Never would have guessed the ending.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When I saw this The Avengers on Amazon I noticed the Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo set was the same price as the Blu-ray/DVD combo set, so I of course bought the four-disc combo set even though I don't have a blu-ray 3D player. The blu-ray is great quality and the extra features are top quality.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|Really a terrific book which lays out all the whys and wherefores of this type of diet.  However, as it states, this is really not a diet, but a new way of eating for a lifetime.  Quite similar in theory and application as the Wheat Belly tome.  I am not that disciplined and cannot give up all wheat products but I love the science behind it.<br /><br />If anyone cuts back on sugar and wheat, and increases protein, he will lose weight.  I figured all this out when I was 21 and had no books to read about diets, but it just makes sense.  And this was over 40 years ago.  Enjoy reading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Love it. It is so fun to play and I have recommended it to others.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It was an okay read. Rather disjointed in the jumping around in it, but there was no ending.  I 100% believe in heaven and life beyond the one here on earth.  This book did nothing to further develop that belief and I don't think it would be helpful to someone who was struggling with this issue.  Poorly written, poorly told and no ednding.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Luv this app. Tells me exactly how much battery left. Best part is tells me how long for full charge via ac or usb. I would highly recommend this app to everybody
B001LF4IA6|5.0|The CD was on pristine condition. The music on it Bruce's traditional superb artistry. I find this oldie a real goodie!

B00511PTWM|5.0|The possibility of swiveling was crucial for my choice because a straight adapter would not have been good in my old Corvette.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I couldn't stop playing. Great graphics. Lots of fun!  Froze a few times in the beginning, but then it was<br />fine.  I highly recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is challenging at first but the puzzle portions do not last long enough.  There needs to be more ways to earn dozer dollars to upgrade to nine levels on the gifts.  I only have three or four at the nine levels, the puzzles are done and I have 5000+ coins.... nothing new to do so it is boring.  Perhaps an update will come along. Worth playing though.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Great show I loved every last second of it. I cannot wait for the fifth season to come out.must buy!!!!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My granddaughter (six years old) and I watched this two or three times on my Kindle Fire. (Okay, I only really watched the whole thing once, then 'read' my book and watched next to her) This was my first time watching something on the Kindle and I was surprised about the quality.  No problems with streaming, pictures or sound. Definitely worth the $1.99 rental.  She would likely rate it five stars. ha ha.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I saw the movie first this book was totally enjoyable. I can't wait to start the next one in the trilogy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Omg read this book!!! It's a live story but action packed as well I couldn't put it down!!!!!<br />Love love this book!!!!

0307383415|4.0|It's difficult to rate what's primarily someone's life story, but I'll take a stab at it...<br /><br />In Dreams from My Father you deep dive into Obama's mind and follow his life story from his earliest days in Hawaii, through his childhood in Indonesia, college years in California and New York, community organizing days in Chicago, and (finally) an extended stay with family in Kenya. The book is hard to put down at first because his life story is interesting and he tells it well - people aren't kidding when they say it reads like a novel. Towards the end of Chicago section the writing starts to feel a bit superfluous. And the Kenya section is way too long.<br /><br />Obama attempts to focus on the central theme of race throughout the book. He doesn't make any really bold claims or present any new theses on the topic, it's more of a reflection on his own personal struggles with the issue. My guess is that for readers with little background knowledge of Obama's past (myself included) the prevailing takeaways from the book will be that Obama has a unique life story (it's remarkable that he's become the US president) and that he struggled (quite a bit) with identity issues well into his 20s due to his mixed race and an absent father. He ultimately \\"closes the circle\\" in Kenya, conveniently, and asserts that he is mostly at peace with the issue by the book's end.<br /><br />A very interesting book, considering it was written by a future US president. If you want an insight into Obama's life, written by the man himself, buy the book - just don't be upset when it starts to drag on after a beginning that sucks you in.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|the only thing. I do not like in this game is you must star over if you die. But all the rest are amezing.please put the save in the game
B009G78EE2|5.0|I really loved this album.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes rap that reflects back on real experiences and real life.  And the music is great too.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is a fun game.  we have played it a lot it is a good thing to play when you have to wait.<br />my little one likes it.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson is one of the best singers I have heard. First winner of American Idol which I never missed and she is wonderful on this greatest hits album.  Get it readers and just \\"listen.\\"
B0058VW36U|3.0|the game Is fun an a challenge.  my little one an I like t o play it.  she e likes it.
B0043RSK3K|2.0|I agree with the basic outline of things told in this book.  The problem is that the book gives me the authors' conclusions rather than just telling the story and letting me draw my own conclusions.  It is just too trite and pat for my taste.  If you subscribe to the point of view of the authors and want people to subscribe to your point of view you would not want them to read this book.<br /><br />There are many books out there that do a much better job.  The most important is Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States.  Any book by Chalmers Johnson would also be better.<br /><br />Find out the facts for yourself and draw your own conclusions.  The challenge is to learn the facts, because they are not well known, and you can be sure you didn't learn them in school where you received a VERY sanitized version of United States History!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|this I s nice to see the weather we without all  the other News that is out there.  don't want my little one to see.

B005CRQ4GU|3.0|When I first found out this book was coming out I was SO excited. I am a HUGE diary of a wimpy kid fan and plus this book had a little romance action and I'm a girl so I couldn't wait to read Jeff kinneys latest work. I guess I was too excited and when I finished reading I was so disappointed. I was expecting more from this book. It seemed a little short and Greg talks too much about his life story in the begining. It still was funny but the part when Greg takes the girl to the dance seemed to lack romance. I know its not twilight but it was cheesy. I feel like Jeff kinney let me down. :(

B005OT2YVA|2.0|Glad this was free on Amazon Prime.  Good effects, terrible plot.<br />It was such a departure from the first two.  I won't ever turn a movie off but this was as close as it gets.
1616614609|5.0|Android: Netrunner is absolutely fantastic! I'm a longtime MTG player so I assumed the concepts presented in Netrunner would be easy to grasp, but this is simply not so. However, this is by no means bad. Netrunner is simply a completely different animal.<br /><br />The two factions presented in the game - the huge and malevolent Mega-corporations and their opponents, the elusive super-hackers called Runners -  are both very interesting and completely different in play. After an initial stumbling Runner game or two while I read the cards and got familiar with the game's extensive vocabulary and mechanics, I was intruding on R&D Departments, siphoning funds, and even electrocuting myself to death with feedback as I foolishly pushed too far into Jinteki Corporation's Servers, in one ill-fated game. (Snare is a vicious card, Runners beware!)<br /><br />Those flavor-lovers out there will love this  - the Android cyberpunk hacking theme just absolutely shines on each and every one of these cards. Android: Netrunner is brilliantly designed and it shows. Definitely a try, I wholeheartedly recommend a buy. (and go buy the expansions, too! :D)
1439156816|4.0|The author delivers an intimate reflection on the art and craft of writing with disarming passion and impressive authenticity. The result is both a revealing memoir and a refreshingly instructive handbook.

B0091VGAXK|4.0|If you like Glee or Rock Band-esque video games--or if you grew up listening to the great 80s hair bands--you will love this movie! It's cheesy, yes, and not going to win an Oscar or other esteemed award. But it's very fun and highly entertaining. Tom Cruise is hilarious. The song mash-ups are awesome as well. It's a great, lighthearted way to spend a couple of hours.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|i have owned several knife sharpeners and this one does not work any better than any of the others... the V blocks don't seem to do much of anything and the diamond rod is only good for bringing a blade back to a knife that is dulled, not sharpening a knife without a blade on it.<br /><br />buy a stone, this isnt worth it.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I bought the Les Miserables movie sountrack album, but shockingly the song \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" is missing! I hope this is not based on a shallow commercial reason such as concern about not being able to sell the album in countries like China for political reasons.. I love the musical and the movie, but the decision to exclude one of the major songs in the musical, as well as the movie, from the album left a bad taste.<br /><br />The song Suddenly feels like it should be in a Disney musical rather than in this majestic and operatic piece, something Belle or the Little Mermaid would sing. Too bad Herbert Kretzmer was not involved in creating this song.  He would not have permitted a song with such bland lyrics to be included.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It held your interest to the very end.  I would definitely read another novel by this same author.  How can I get a job at Amazon?  I haven't had much luck on the web site.  Thank you.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Sobbing. This book turned me into an emotional mess, and even though I knew it probably would before I started reading it, I'm tremendously glad I did.<br /><br />Louisa Clark has led a fairly uneventful life. She lives with her parents, grandfather, sister, and nephew in the English town where she grew up, enjoys her job as a waitress at a local cafe, and has been dating Patrick, a personal trainer, for a number of years. She's never considered herself the \\"kind of person\\" who would enjoy movies with subtitles, classical music concerts, or really going beyond her comfort zone.<br /><br />When the cafe closes suddenly, Louisa finds herself in a state of flux. Her family is dependent upon her income, and with the world in an economic crisis, jobs are hard to come by, especially for someone with virtually no experience doing anything else. After a number of unsuccessful tries in unappealing jobs, she is hired to be an assistant to a recently paralyzed man, at a higher salary than she has made previously, despite the fact she has never done anything of the sort.<br /><br />Will Traynor was a ruthless businessman at the top of his game. He bought and sold companies, making tons of money, traveled the world to visit all of the exotic places he had always dreamed of, pushed his limits with extreme sports and challenges, and dated the most beautiful women. And then a motorcycle accident leaves him a quadriplegic, angry at the world for all he can no longer do, and having no desire to continue living.<br /><br />Will intimidates Louisa, even in his current state. He doesn't want yet another caregiver telling him what would be good for him to do, especially one with no experience or self-esteem. Yet the two begin a relationship of mutual respect and friendship, albeit slowly and sometimes grudgingly. When Louisa realizes that she could be the catalyst to changing Will's outlook on life and his desire to keep on living, she does everything in her power to make that happen, not understanding the toll it will take on her life and her relationships--not to mention how it will affect Will.<br /><br />This is a tremendously moving story, even if it follows a somewhat traditional path. You know that Will and Louisa will dislike each other at first, that she'll consider quitting her job, and that ultimately, she'll break through his shell. But even as things you anticipate will happen actually do, the characters Jojo Moyes created, and the emotions she has imbued them with, will find their way into your heart. The book is funny at times, frustrating at times, but really fulfilling, and there are certainly some surprises in store.<br /><br />I have said many times before that I'm a total emotional sap when it comes to books like this, but even as it left me with tears dripping down my face, it's a story I can't stop thinking about. And it's one I wholeheartedly recommend, and would love to hear what others think. Read it!
