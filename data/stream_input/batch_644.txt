0618680004|5.0|Like other Dawkins books, this one is extremely well written.  More importantly, it can change the way you think about Religion and God.  You don't have to agree with all of it, but many people will agree with more of it than they believe they will when they begin reading.  It makes atheism defendable.
B000E6UK32|4.0|Blondie have finally got the respect they truly deserve. Seeing them inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was pretty cool (they even had an onstage snit to prove they were still loaded with attitude), and this collection is just frosting on the beater.<br /><br />On the plus side, you get three interesting \\"new\\" items. There's a previously unavailable mix of \\"Good Boys\\" (from \\"The Curse of Blondie\\" CD), a new mix of \\"In The Flesh\\" (which doesn't better the original) and an outrageous mash-up of The Doors Vs Blondie with \\"Rapture Riders\\" (and its accompanying video!). The interesting thing about the new \\"In The Flesh\\" is that you can imagine the new breed of Rock/pop goddesses like Gwen Stefani of Brittany Spears tackling it - and knowing they wouldn't have a peroxided molecule of the sass that Debbie Harry has.<br /><br />Blondie was always about flash and glamour, which is what made their best albums (\\"Parallel Lines\\" and \\"Eat To The Beat\\") so charmingly eclectic and their best singles so earth shattering. They were the first \\"new-wave\\" band to score a number one with -- Fer crying out loud -- a disco song, and were the very first band to chart a hit rap song that mashed-up rap and pop. (It was nearly 6 years later that Run-DMC would share video space with the resurgent Aerosmith.) Even the lesser known singles are killer. \\"The Hardest Part\\" has got to be the fiercest Debbie Harry vocal, and the French/English version of \\"Denis\\" is a lost classic.<br /><br />The DVD is a hoot. It is kind of striking to see these primitive MTV era bits from \\"Heart Of Glass\\" and \\"Rapture.\\" It's worth it just to see the band in their young and hungry stages...hard to believe that the band that recorded the terrific \\"Maria\\" were in their 50s. All great archival material.<br /><br />Minor quibble - single edits. But these were SMASH singles, and it just goes to show you that there is no shame in being a pop band, and there is also no reason a pop band can't have a major impact on popular culture. Thanks to this new CD/DVD set from Blondie, you can now join in with those who call the music of Debbie Harry and company a pleasure without using the word \\"guilty\\" as a preface. Although the 2002 \\"Greatest Hits\\" is probably a better CD for the casual listener, for us fans, this is absolutely worth the bucks.his new CD/DVD set from Blondie, you can now join in with those who call the music of Debbie Harry and company a pleasure without using the word \\"guilty\\" as a preface.

B000002KOO|4.0|Quiet an assortment of tunes on this one. I call it the versatile album because the band delves into the classical music a bit then grinds out some heavy guitar, rhythms, in other portions of the album. It's kinda like a roller coaster ride sometimes you catch your breathe then your adrenaline revs up.

B0000714BP|5.0|This film is a treat.  It is a quiet storm that starts slowly and before you know it, the three 'girls' have captured your heart even as they capture those of the townspeople.  Wesley, Patrick and John really should be commended for their performances here.  You forget their celebrity identities completely and see them solely as Miss Noxeema, Miss Vida, and Miss ChiChi.  Get it and giggle and aw and celebrate!

B000G1ALRK|5.0|I orginally saw Eric as a warm up for a Bob Seger concert. I liked what I heard but like any other concert was too loud to make out lyrics. So I thought what the heck and bought his cd. I liked it at first but the more I played the more I liked. This guy is good .He writes his own songs and for his youth he seems to have experience beyond his years. I bought the cd for the song  Sinners Like Me and These Boots.I swear his song Two Pink Lines reminds me of Mellancamp. I think he is going to be a rising star and look forward to his next work.
0767827791|4.0|Kim Novak made a tremendous impression as the heroine of \\"Picnic\\". Looking cool, lush and marvelous in lilac as she walked through her films expressing polite interest and a terror of emotional reactions toward the situations which arose...<br /><br />\\"Picnic\\" follows a brawny wanderer who causes sexual havoc one summer in a small American town...<br /><br />Holden was the charming drifter who arrives, on one hot Labor Day, to a small Kansas town, to look up an old schoolmate, Alan (Robertson), who is the town rich-man's son and from whom he hopes to obtain work...Alan is kind at first--until Madge, Alan's fianc&eacute;e falls for Hal...<br /><br />\\"Picnic\\" was quite compulsive despite some overacting...<br /><br />Betty Field was excellent as Madge's warm and protective mother who fears for her daughter's happiness if she passes up her rich fianc&eacute;e... Madge's teenaged sister (Strasberg) longed for beauty and sympathy... Her good-hearted neighbor, Verna Felton, was gently compassionate...<br /><br />Robertson was handsome but presumptuous and arrogant... O'Connell was delightful as the confused and unsure cigar-chomping salesman... Rosalind Russell was the easily frustrated and inconsistent spinster who loses her self-control while drunk and practically accosts Hal on the dance floor, destroying his shirt... When Hal rebuffs her, she storms off in anger; later she begs her shy boyfriend to marry her...<br /><br />Beautifully photographed, \\"Picnic\\" will remain always a loved romantic film, largely for the high chemistry of its two stars, Holden and Novak...

B000ETQRCM|2.0|I have to agree with the reviewer from January 1st, Hoplite Whatever-his-name-is on one thing.  Pearl Jam needs to get rid of the Bush-bashing.  I say this not in any great defense of our current president; I am neither pro- nor anti-Bush.  I am a registered independent, and so have no interest in feeding the two-headed monster that has a stranglehold on our political system.  However, I am tired of hearing PJ bitch and moan about everything Bush does.  I'll bet they would even criticize the way the man takes a piss.  They should do what every other empty-headed, plastic personality celebrity should do in regards to political statements:  leave it alone.

B0000009RX|4.0|Frank Zappa's best work is often weighed down with his insistent brand of humor, and this album, perhaps the best of his early period, is no exception. Some of his studio mastery is already at work with the story of an intruder in the studio somehow messing with the tapes weaving through the songs. And the acerbic look at the hippie scene is devastating. Anybody who ever thought about going to San Francisco with flowers in their hair should have been forced to listen first. And doesn't that sound dated; there's the rub - stuff like that drags down the timeless quality of this music. It becomes a \\"period document\\" instead of just a great musical listen.  <br />But don't let that stop you - this is a textbook example of how rock music was already becoming a melting pot for every genre imaginable. And in this album, it's in the hands of a master. In multiple styles, brilliantly executed, the Mothers create a rich sonic landscape of memorable melodies, creative instrumentation, daring rhythmns, and superb playing. Don't miss this one.
B00005JLT5|5.0|'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.'<br /><br />In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence:<br /><br />Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...<br /><br />Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup...<br /><br />Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...<br /><br />Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, \\"I wish I knew you better.\\"<br /><br />Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...<br /><br />Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...<br /><br />Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...<br /><br />Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...<br /><br />Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head...<br /><br />Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..<br /><br />Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...<br /><br />Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...br /> <br />Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals...

B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Alan Parker has always had a gift for the integration of music and film, and his efforts over the years have reflected that. Movies like \\"Fame\\" & \\"The Commitments\\" have made him a director more remembered for his music video skills than his storytelling, even though he directed gripping controversial more seriously films, like \\"Midnight Express,\\" and \\"Mississippi Burning.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Wall\\" tells the account of a rock star's breakdown, Pink Floyd slowing down into madness... Pink's madness is illustrated with living flashbacks of his life... He has visions of his childhood from a baby held in the cradle to his present moment... We have little Pink suffering from alienation for the death of his father in the war, and taken under the care of his mother... We have also rock and roll star Pink, who is destroyed by his evident insanity and is driven over the edge by his wife's infidelity and we have a blown insane Pink, a Nazi dictator under the Hammer Regime leading a series of occurrences like raping, breaking and pillaging...<br /><br />Alan Parker translates the music into memorable images that are insensible to love or pity... All of Pink's life is projected on the screen... We see and hear songs altered from an abstract concept into a disgusting vision of students being thrown into a meat grinder...<br /><br />Pink constructs the wall by building up tension... In mixing up sexuality and violence, he creates a new window into Pink's character... The animated sequences that reflected Pink's foolishness are important and influential...<br /><br />Alan Parker's direction moves the story cleverly from the present into the past and into a possible future, drawing a warning, but still contemplating traumas of a child with hurtful effects on the fully grown man... The result is a mad piece of cinema, a kind of a bad dream becoming even worse than usual...<br /><br />The film exploits great special effects, some frightful and impossible to understand... The music praises the film so well from declaring noisy rock and roll music to quiet ballads of insanity...<br /><br />Bob Geldof is amazing as Pink, the British rock star broken in pieces under the psychological pressure of an American Tour...<br /><br />Pink Floyd-The Wall is a bizarre animation reinforcing its vision of an insane, inhumane, unjust and cruel world, not easy to follow...<br /><br />The film stands out as one of the classic in the teenage scene, specially teenagers who take or receive narcotic and due to its psychedelic nature leaves you greatly depressed...usic praises the film so well from declaring noisy rock and roll music to quiet ballads of insanity... <br /> <br />Bob Geldof is amazing as Pink, the British rock star broken in pieces under the psychological pressure of an American Tour... <br /> <br />Pink Floyd-The Wall is a bizarre animation reinforcing its vision of an insane, inhumane, unjust and cruel world, not easy to follow... <br /> <br />The film stands out as one of the classic in the teenage scene, specially teenagers who take or receive narcotic and due to its psychedelic nature leaves you greatly depressed...  <br /> <br />

B000JK8OYU|4.0|I really enjoyed hearing LOVE the first time.  I loved it the second time.  After the third listening, I was ready to go back to the original recordings.  This is a fun idea, and I'm sure it works well at the Cirque du Solie show, but as an album it could have been more exciting.  I agree with the summations that it isn't bold enough.  Just as I would really get into some of the re-mixes, it would evolve back into a fingerprint file of another song.  It is just too tame.  The Beatles were bold, this should be as bold as they were.  On many accounts, George Martin was not bold.  He took the bold ideas that the Beatles had and helped make them happen, but he was far too conservative a producer for their creative minds, and I believe his conservativeness is evident in this presentation.  I do enjoy it, however, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Beatles.  I would also recommend it to someone who has never really listened to them.  On the other hand, perhaps the best thing one could do is buy Rubber Soul or Revolver, that way you would get a real taste of what they are all about.
B00003CXCD|4.0|William Wyler's \\"Roman Holiday\\" is about a runaway princess (Audrey Hepburn) who escapes from surveillance and believing herself incognito spends a night - perfectly innocent- in a good-natured American newsman's Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) apartment...<br /><br />Her amiable adventures provide the basis for a charming fantasy-romance adventure... We see her on the loose for a single day in Rome smoking her \\"very first\\" cigarette, cutting her long black hair, riding on the back of a reporter's motor scooter, hesitating to slip her fragile hand in the 'mouth of truth,' escaping police, swimming the Tiber river, falling in love with the handsome reporter and at last returning to her official duties...<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn won the Academy Award, and nearly every film she made during the following fifteen years was worthwhile... She was good in epics as she was in musicals... She was nominated for additional Academy Awards for \\"Sabrina,\\" \\"The Nun's Story,\\" \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" and \\"Wait Until Dark.\\" She had such expressive big eyes that she was hardly required to speak... She was a star of extravagant beauty and her part in \\"Roman Holiday,\\" (her first in a starring role) perfectly suitable for her wispy, thin little persona, haunted us by her looks and her voice..<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" was directed by a serious artist who knows how to tell a story... Meticulous, William Wyler worked out several doubling that I like to mention:<br /><br />- Hepburn is seen dancing in the great mirrors of the hall, and soon after, in civilian dress, she walks alone passing near the same mirrors in the empty shadowy hall...<br /><br />- At the extravagant ball she dances with short old personalities, and next evening she dances with our hero the tall American reporter on a barge in the Tiber river...<br /><br />- When she lies persistent to sleep in her Embassy bed, she sees the angels in the four corners of the adorned ceiling, and when she wakes in Peck's bed, she observes the water tank in the corner of his ceiling...<br /><br />- She has her hair cut by a barber who begins unwilling to cut it, then with emotion cut it all off... In that night she meets the same barber who has shaved his moustache...<br /><br />They were two receptions in the film: Near the beginning our bored princess receives an official welcome... Near the end she holds a press conference... Among the gentlemen of the press is Peck affirming that the story of her day with him is safe... And Oscar Nominee Eddie Albert discreetly presents her with his 'paparazzi' commemorative photos of her visit...<br /><br />The 'go away' of two lovers who certify their tender feelings by not saying goodbye brings very pleasant tears...<br /><br />And there is a last doubling of Wyler: Late night after they kiss in the funny little borrowed car, Hepburn leaves and Peck watches her disappear down the narrow street as she runs the corner returning to the Embassy... The camera holds for a moment on the little street making its emptiness speak in silence... The next morning, after the press conference, and the princess with her attendants depart as all the reporters except Peck... He is left alone, looking fixedly at the door through which 'his beloved' has left... Then he turns... The camera - below him - retreats as he walks slowly down the elegant space of the palace hall... His footsteps producing an echo... At the great door he stops again, and turns one more time... Nobody there... The nice dream is over... He walks out of the shot leaving William Wyler's academic use of deep-focus detains his camera on the cool elegant hall with its guards and ceiling... It is the end of a lovely story, a fairy tale...<br /><br />With a captivating charisma, Hepburn ad Peck are delightful from start to finish...he observes the water tank in the corner of his ceiling... <br /> <br />- She has her hair cut by a barber who begins unwilling to cut it, then with emotion cut it all off...

B000092T6M|4.0|Eight hundred years ago, Richard the Lionheart led the third Great Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land from the Turks... Most of the young English noblemen who flocked to his banner never returned home... The film opens near Jerusalem in a terrible dungeon where Robin of Locksley is about to show the 'English' courage...<br /><br />Locksley manages to escape with a fellow prisoner, a Moor called Azeem, and flees home to England...<br /><br />On his arrival to Britain, the prodigal son finds dark forces plotting against his absent king... His father has been slain and his lands confiscated by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham...<br /><br />To evade Gisborn's soldiers, Locksley heads off to the supposedly haunted Sherwood Forest, where he takes his chance with ghosts, and where he is accosted by a band of outlaws...<br /><br />Like Burt Lancaster in 'The Flame and the Arrow,' Costner tries to lead the woodsmen in a revolt against injustice and tyranny, but misses the youthful exuberance and passion of Dardo...<br /><br />Costner looks handsome as the legendary Prince of Thieves who must use his mastery of archery, siege warfare, and combat strategy to rescue his beloved damsel...<br /><br />Morgan Freeman looks great as Azeem, the wizard with uncommon clarity of mind, who vows to repay Robin for saving his life... His knowledge of science is a surprising blow...<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio is Robin's beautiful and clever companion whose love for the arrogant young nobleman led her to see him taking her advice in Sherwood Forest...<br /><br />Alan Rickman fluctuates between being a comic buffoon and a dangerous madman...

B000063DHL|5.0|Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.  <br /> The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.  <br /> Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's.

0784011176|4.0|Director-screenwriter Jane Campion started at the movies in the early 1980s at the Australian School of Film and Television... She clearly emerged from her cultural heritage to become one of the world's premiere female directors...<br /><br />Campion's films typically have a treacherous terrain of searing emotional intensity... We recognize ourselves in the ways her characters think and behave... Her work signifies a break with the tragic, the Gothic and the sentimental...<br /><br />Her exquisite film which won three Academy Awards including one for Campion's screenplay, is not about sex, but about passion...<br /><br />Jane challenges the viewer on many levels... Her film (literary inspired from 'Wuthering Heights') explores new territory in the delicious handling of female sexuality and pleasure with the ecstasy of a loving relationship...<br /><br />In one scene Ada, with tears of anger, hits Baines hard across the face, as if she has spoken words of love... With each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remain locked together, the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed... Only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts...<br /><br />No woman artist had approached sex in such a direct and liberating manner... Campion's scenes shows Baines' face crumpling with the exquisite pain of his pleasure... Ada moving his head to her chest, and Baines struggling through her dress anxious to touch her skin...<br /><br />Nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film tells the story of Ada, a strong willful 19th-century Scotswoman who hasn't spoken, since she was six years old... Ada has been set up in an arranged marriage to a British emigrant in New Zealand...<br /><br />The film opens with Ada who is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen to meet her husband Stewart, a landowner who is without much emotion or real love... Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs... On her head a black bonnet... Around her neck her pad and pen...<br /><br />Campion manages to chose a cast to suit her purpose and style... Ada is not any easy role and Holly Hunter plays her without vanity... Her face is alight with facial expression, sometimes tender, sometimes sad, sometimes humorous, sometimes soft, while her hands and fingers are quick and neat...<br /><br />Ada speaks through sign-language translated by her young daughter Flora, and through her beloved piano which happens to be the prime source of her expression... She takes great delight in feeling her fingers on her piano's keys... But in the way she eyes the illiterate, uncultured Baines, there is an insolence and lack of respect... We watch her stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches her neck...<br /><br />Harvey Kietel plays the lonely neighbor George Baines, a depressive man who is everything Stewart is not... He has never seen a graceful woman behave with so much abandon... Ada moves to the piano... She wants to touch it, but she is torn by her feelings, wanting it, but not owning it... Baines views Ada totally absorbed in her piano music... He seems satisfied to watch... He finds himself edging irresistibly closer, magnetically drawn to the spectacle...<br /><br />Baines enjoys her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face... Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply... He is experiencing a strange sense of appreciation and lust... He feels powerless... He is desperate and romantic... He no longer admires her absorption with the piano... He is jealous of it... His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano... Ada's long white neck proves irresistible... Baines comes across the room, kisses her, and asks: 'Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. There's a way you can have your piano back.'<br /><br />Anna Paquin has been proclaimed one of the best child acting roles ever... She gives a subtle and complex performance as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather... She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped suddenly... She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut... Her venture is one of challenge and curiosity... Her complex portrayal of Flora won her the Best Supporting Actress...<br /><br />Sam Neill plays the intense, moralistic and very-Victorian husband Alistair Stewart, who never understands his woman's nature... He surveys Baines' hut suspiciously... There are sounds inside which are worrying him... By wondering around the hut, he finds a hole where he can see the two lovers kissing, and undressing... He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, he steps up to look again...<br /><br />Jane Campion creates an unusual film, poetic and lyrical, complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods, which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece... She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes...nce as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather...

Well behold, I am lucky I found this one. The first few chords of MM's bass just pulsated through my ears as funky-jazzy joy. What a refreshing sound from the normal standards of music.  <br /> I give it four stars for the production. A little too much bass at times, but nothing an equalizer couldn't remedy. This is well worth the money, enjoy!!!

0767817729|3.0|'Revenge' has a recently retired fighter pilot (Kevin Costner) who goes to the coastal city of Puerto Vallarta, to enjoy the hospitality of an old friend he saves once his life on a hunting trip...<br /><br />The possessive longtime friend has a wonderful-but-unhappy wife... Mireya (Madeleine Stowe) is an exotic young brunette, with great magnetism, who truly blew Costner's mind... Mireya embarks on a passionate affair, that naturally drives her husband 'Tibby' (Anthony Quinn) out of his mind...<br /><br />Sexual tension is an integral part of Tony Scott's character's conflict... It rises off like heat emanating from the sand when the two lovers head in a jeep toward a nearby cute cabin... Costner and Stowe are attracted to one another, and naturally, the more they fight the attraction, the more they are thrown together...<br /><br />Stowe's body comes alive at that brief caress, quickening her pulse, making her breath catch in anticipation... She experiences the heat in the slow slide of Costner's fingers, a passionate demand she couldn't help but respond to...<br /><br />The plot is really predictable, and there's real high tension in the first part, but multiple stabbings, shootings, and beatings in the second, as the husband enters a storm of insane fury against the lovers...<br /><br />'Revenge' is certainly a realm of brutality and pain, of love gone wrong and vengeance gone mad...

I know there are a number of \\"movie purists\\" out there who would scold me for this, but I actually enjoyed the colorized version of this, as I remember seeing this version in the late 1980's on TV;  the process really brings the film to life and, at least to me, does not look artificial in any way.  Includes a wonderful commentary by Maureen O'Hara who fondly remembers the film & fellow actors (most of whom have passed away) with great detail.  This 1947 classic is the definitive version of the story (check out the 70's and 90's versions later, if you must) and is too good to be enjoyed only at Christmas.  A great DVD release!

0783225849|5.0|\\"Psycho\\" is the most astounding, daring, and successful scary film ever made... Hitchcock uses pure cinema to arouse audience emotions...<br /><br />For the first forty minutes he cautiously builds up sympathy and audience identification with a troubled fugitive, a young estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who wants to marry Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but neither can afford it... Entrusted, by a wealthy customer, with $40,000 to put in a safe deposit box in a bank, she succumbs to temptation and steals the money in order to start a new life with her lover... So the motive is love!<br /><br />We begin to feel the tension when she's spotted - leaving Phoenix, Arizona - by her boss who thinks she remains in bed with a headache... Then, when she pulls off the highway to take a nap and is awaken by a suspicious patrolman - in disturbing dark glasses - who trails her... Hitchcock's trademark-- paranoia about the police is here at his best...<br /><br />Frightened and tired by a violent rainstorm, she stops at Bates Motel and has a small talk with a twitchy cordial motel keeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins-in an outstanding performance), an attractive shy young man who seems uneasy around her and can't even bring himself to pronounce the world bathroom...<br /><br />The movie turns dark and claustrophobic when she overheard the voice of Norman's mother speaking sharply with her son, and after she learns Norman's strong devotion to his irritable mother...<br /><br />Alone in the room, she strips to shower... Safe and relaxing, the hot air rises as the water cascades over her... Suddenly she turns at a sound, her eyes dilate with horror and her repeated screams rend the air as a hand from nowhere holding a long knife plunges it repeatedly into her body... Her blood, mingling with the water, flushes down the drain in one of the most terrifying images of modern cinema...<br /><br />No one who saw the film will forget the shock effect of that scene... Not only because of its terrifying realism, with the blood gushing and swirling on the shower floor; but also because Leigh was a sympathetic and star figure... Although she had stolen, we felt involved with her (as we were involved with Marnie); we wanted her to get away; and here, with two-thirds of the film still to got we watched helplessly as the life and the beauty and the hopes were butchered out of her...<br /><br />The movie is only off one third when Hitchcock's spiral close-up of her unmoving eyeball reveals the nightmare... But the movie does really begin after her murder because once she is killed, we never stop thinking about her...<br /><br />With Marion Crane gone, our attention is shift to the sensitive Norman with a passion for birds and mother... They are very close and he guards her jealousy...<br /><br />As three people began to investigate, our sympathies were subtly maneuvered to the good-looking young man who, it seemed, must try to protect a homicidal mother... We see him distraught, cleaning up and disposing of Marion's car, with her body and cash, into a swamp...<br /><br />We have no reason to think that he himself have done the dirty work... So could his crippled old mother be the vicious murderer? Or do we have some other reason to suspect that Norman's abusive mother does not exist? We heard the old woman talking constantly to him and we see Norman carrying her to the cellar... Or is it another Hitchcock's trick? But the knife comes out again striking and killing... The high angle shot shows perfectly her mad menacing rush from her bedroom...<br /><br />Hitchcock's version is definitive, a terrifying insinuating thriller with only two sudden and vicious murders... A classic essential cinema with his rich, vivid and effective imagery in the use of light and shadow; his voyeurism when Perkins spies on Leigh in a black bra (The first time he shows a lady disrobed); his 'metaphysical vertigo' in the overhead shot as Norman drags his mother down to the cellar...mother down to the cellar...  <br /> <br />

B000I5X81K|5.0|Easily another hit by Josh Groban.  Such a talented young man!
B000065BPB|3.0|The short version - I would say they are okay based on the $73 I paid with no tax or shipping charge, a reasonable value, something I would likely buy again knowing what I know now. <br /> <br />The extended version - To qualify my review a bit, I have very limited experience with headphones. I've used the little ear plug type and these are far better, but I tried the Bose Tri Ports in the store and they are no where near as good as that in my opinion.  The Bose were lighter, more comfortable and had better sound.  I have to say, I somewhat expected an out of body experience when I ordered the Sennheiser, but that is not what I got.  What I got was pretty good sound with good separation. <br /> <br />Other reviewers mentioned the weight and tightness.  Mainly its the weight as I can feel the padded arch sitting on the top of my head, but not so much that its a problem.  Tightness really was not a factor for me.  I like the around-the-ear feel.  As for the quietness of them, isolating outside noise, I don't think they are as good as what I hoped and what others mentioned.  One of the main reasons I purchased these was to listen to TV and music in my family room which is right next to the kitchen.  When there is a bunch of activity in the kitchen, I need to blast the speakers which creates even more noise.  Headphones, I thought would block the outside noise, but it really doesn't.  The solution is to crank up the headphones a bit which seems to work okay.  I have to wonder if the noise cancelling headphones would have been a better choice.  The only way to really know is to try different ones at home, but how do you do that? <br /> <br />Overall I am reasonably pleased with these headphones based on the price I paid.  They certainly aren't worth the list price of $199.  If I buy another set in the future, I would consider upgrading to something like the Bose Tri Ports, but I'm not sure they are worth twice as much as these.  I rated it 3 stars, but 3 1/2 stars is more my opinion, say average to good.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although it was pulled from the TV network before I even heard of it, it was recommended to me by a couple friends and I fell in love with it ever since. The series is usually said to be a mix between Sci-Fi and Western, but in reality it's quite a different experience from either. <br /> <br />What got me hooked was the determination of the main character in trying to revolt against the evil empire. He tries to play a cold captain, but you can tell he's quite warm hearted.

So far, I have converted two people into Grey's Anatomy addicts, and I'm working on a third by lending she/he/it Season One.

0743289412|3.0|Lisey's story was an adventure that wraps readers into blankets of fear, love, anger, and confusion. I started reading the book feeling that it would be amazing and I was quickly disappointed once I started. I felt that the beginning of the story starts off full of unnecessary details that had little or nothing to do with the main storyline. It would switch from a brief history of a character that had no importance to inserting lots of sayings that seemed pointless. I felt that too many characters were introduced all at once and it took awhile for me to get used to the way that Lisey and Scott spoke to each other. It was full of \\"bools\\" this and \\"strap it on that\\" and plenty of \\"as the saying goes\\". Many pages could have been omitted from this book because of all the senseless information that only seemed to slow down the story. <br /> <br />After continuing the reading it finally became interesting once \\"Zack Mccool\\" was introduced and Lisey began a conflict that felt like cat-mouse. Emotions rose, more important info about Scott is revealed, and then youre introduced to the world of Boo-ya Moon. Now that Stephen had my attention I couldn't let the book go. I found Amanda to be enjoyable in the latter part of the novel, and laughed out loud at some of Stephen's characters that had humorous ways of thought and actions. After all of this pleasure, I thought the ending was incredibly dull and that the story could have ended with more of a bang. This IS Stephen King,  isn't it? Many people were happy and surprised at him making a romance based novel, but I don't feel this novel is any different from what he's done in the past. You could have always found romantic pieces in many of his past books. You can always encounter a gigantic monster or a crazed lunatic in a large amount of his older works. Therefore, I feel that while Lisey's Story was decently satisfactory it wasn't amazing or worthy of being called one of Kings best works.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|This is good music!  The new mixes of the songs do take some getting used to because a Beatles fan expects to hear certain things in certain places.  Kindof fun to pick out the pieces from different songs and play \\"name that tune.\\"

B000I5X81K|4.0|I like Josh.  And I like this recording.  But it did take some getting used to.  The featured radio song, \\"You are loved\\", sounds better on the CD than what I hear on the radio.  Which was awesome.  There is a song that reminds me of \\"Starry, Starry Night\\" if you know that song.  I wasn't expecting that, though it isn't bad.  And the last three song seem to be Josh breaking away from what he is really good at.  They are just okay.  I would have thought with Dave Matthews co-writing \\"Lullaby\\" that I would love it, and it is the one I like best of the last three songs, but it still is just okay.  I was very surprised that I didn't like \\"Machine\\" with Herbie Hancock.  Overall, the CD is good.  Just be prepared for some surprises.

B000BJS4SU|3.0|Donald Fagan put out the great album called \\"Morph The Cat\\" but it wasn't about John Mayer.  Perhaps that should have been the title to this album.  It seems John Mayer does his best to morph into SRV, Jimi, and for some unexpainable reason Dave Matthews (a sound nobody should aspire to), as well as others.  Quite obviously the kid can play the guitar very well and sing with feeling, but I'd really be curious to hear him discover who John Mayer really is, cause I can't find that out from this album.  All that aside, it's an imminently listenable album with moments that shine.

B000FL7CAK|4.0|Fans of Buffy or 90210 should be sure to check this out. Veronica is smart, sassy, cynical, and a 1st-rate private eye. If you haven't already, check out Season One. <br /> <br />Season 2 sees Veronica confronting lots of new cases. The mysteries of Season 1 are (mostly) solved. Veronica narrowly escapes a fatal bus crash that kills many of her classmates. Who did it? Spend the rest of the season finding out.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, each episode has a very interesting plot of its own. Highlight of the season is when Veronica's boyfriend disappears with his daughter from another classmate, Meg, who barely survived the bus crash. Did he & Veronica just break up, or are they conspiring? <br /> <br />The producer and many of the writers of Veronica Mars were also involved with the Buffy series, so expect plenty of wit, sarcasm, and surprising plot turns. <br /> <br />
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This is my 3rd 12C.  (The first one got crushed, the second had a bad keyboard.)  It's a workhorse financial calculator, the Platinum edition is faster and more powerful.  It should last the rest of my life (I'm 68).  Unconditional recommendation.
0375505091|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter, who is a photographer.  It is a beautiful book and is a wonderful gift for someone who loves photography.  My daughter was delighted with this book. It would also make a great coffee table book.
068987474X|5.0|Seriously, I LOVED this book. I'm not much of a reader cause I don't have that much spare time, but when I was reading this book I didn't want to put it down at all. It brought a lot of things to a new light, and made me realize somethings. I would recomend this book to any female. Now I am a HUGE Greg Behrendt fan, and I watch his show as often as possible. <br />
B000EAT246|5.0|Still a great movie after all these years, and the commentary is priceless.  Highly recommend.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Not only is Alias one of the most entertaining shows that has ever been on television, but couple that with the design of the Rambaldi box, and you've got one of the coolest box sets ever!  The exclusive bonus disc hidden in the secret compartment is a nice touch as well.  The only downside with the features on the extra disc is that they should have been included with Season 5 special features (especially the Season 5 deleted scenes).  There should have probably been something different on the Rambaldi disc.<br /><br />Other than that, this box set is fantastic, and it sure looks great on my DVD shelf.
0307237699|5.0|This book describes in clear terms the trade-offs politicans have to make as they cast their votes. It also reflects a new vision of pragmatism tempered with hope so sorely needed in these times.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have been collecting Dylan since I was in college in the sixties. I have every one of his albums, with the possible exception of one or two released in Europe. It would be impossible for anyone, including Bob, to release albums as great as his first few but this last one comes as close as any he has produced for the last several years.  His backup band is tight and the songs are vintage Dylan.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie is so funny - a classic.  Its even more funny if you know anything about mystery writers of old - like Agatha Christie, etc.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|While shopping for gifts for my family on Amazon I was thrilled to find this movie available for myself. It's one of those movies that has always stuck in my head. I have found you see it differently at different ages.
B000I5X81K|5.0|The person I bought it for was estatic. Said it was wonderful.
B00005U11Z|5.0|We purchased this DVD because we rented it from NetFlix. If you love Journey, you are going to be very happy with this DVD. Sound quality, color and actual footage is better than most I have seen.  <br /> <br />Songs on it are everything a Journey fan can want.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this for any MUST HAVE Journey fan.  <br /> <br />
1932907009|5.0|This is a  great book.  I had read other books, but this one is fun and teaches at the same time.  Highly recommend.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Really cool movie if you like FF7! or just a good animated movie!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have never seen this show before, but I love the the CD. It's great you really do get a feel for the show Idina and Kristin are amazing. If you love musicals this is a great one!! Get it!!!!
1905236042|4.0|I teach yoga to both adults & kids.  I really liked these cards as a resource.  I used the ideas for games on the backof the cards,  for some of my kids' classes, & they worked well.  I have also used the cards to show what the poses look like to the kids.  The large size of the cards is a plus too.
B00079018K|5.0|I first heard about Kasabian about a year ago, with the song Club Foot I was immediately amazed. As tracks such as L.S.F, Reason is Treason, and a lesser known song The Last High, I was \\"in love\\" with Kasabian, some might say their music isnt the most original, but hell, who is. Anyway i would definately recommend getting both of their cd's, Kasabian, and Empire if you want to flat out rock to some brits that will rock you bollocks. One more thing, If you hold the control button (Ctrl) on the keyboard, this will override the software on the cd that makes in impossible to copy this to iTunes, or whatever other software you use. This basically works the same way as what you would do to override the pop-up blocker on your browser. I can safely say ive made a couple spare copies for my car so i can keep my master copy of Kasabian safe in the Cd changer. If it works for me, it can work for you. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is at his best in The God Delusion.  He argues that it's reasonable to apply the tools of science to investigate the probability that God exists.  He reviews all the arguments for the existance of God (or gods), including Thomas Aquinas's \\"proofs\\", recent prayer experiments, the argument that religion promotes morality and so forth and finds that the probability of God existing is very near zero.  He sees natural selection as being a very powerful driver of evolution, making supernatural creationism (also known as \\"Intelligent Design\\") utterly unnecessary.  And he attacks religious fundamentalism as the complete inverse of science;  religious fundamentalists have the illusion that they know the truth as given in their holy book and nothing will budge them from their belief.  Science, on the other hand, looks at natural phenomena and searches for natural causes for such phenomena;  it makes hypotheses, tests them, and rejects those which do not agree with observed facts.   The universe as revealed by Science is truly awesome. <br />   I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has wondered whether a kind and powerful god exists or if God is nothing more than a delusion. <br />
B000H305U0|5.0|If you love Justin get this! If you love music get this!! This cd is amazing. Not only is this CD different then anything he has ever done, its totally new to music. He is truely an innovator in music and this cd truly shows that. All the tracks sound different and they are amazing in theri own right. There is a song for every one of my many moods. Justin Timberlake is a true artist. If you like to dance about then this is a great cd for you!
0385486804|5.0|What I found most touching about INTO THE WILD was the care with which Krakauer explored the life story of his subject, Chris McCandless, a young man who chose to live an unconventional life after graduating college by venturing into the Alaskan wilderness and attempting to live on only what he found there. In Krakauer's hands, McCandless is neither a victim nor a foolhardy adventurer. In the end, McCandless is depicted as a human being, like you or me, who has made his own choices; some gave him great joy, others brought about his demise. I also liked the way Krakauer compared McCandless's experiences with that of others in American history who attempted to interface directly with Nature. And I liked that Krakauer vulnerably employed his own experience of undertaking a difficult solo climb up a treacherous Alaskan mountain as a way of helping the reader better understand how relatively normal people come to take on such risks. This is not cold or clever reportage, but a compassionate account of one young man's all-too-brief journey through this world. Oddly, I found this to be a very spiritual book.
1596912367|5.0|Exciting novel of intelligence, in this case British misinformation work in the USA before America entered the war against Nazi Germany. The author writes well about what he knows well - the unwrapping of the layers of information years later. The unmasking of the villain and of his motivesis excellent; the account of the melodramatic events in America a little less so. <br />     The British tutored our intelligence work in WW II.  Along with that we got Blunt, Burgess, McLean, Philby.
0679746323|2.0|This is horribly written and subjective on the part of the author. It is is poor \\"reportage\\". It was hard to get through because of the writing. However, the facts are interesting enough to slog through it.
B00009MGGI|5.0|Exceptional..........!. Finest BBC production ever. Cast perfect and Ian Richardson never better. <br />Bill
0525457585|5.0|If you like fantasy and want to be taken away into a journey filled with strange and characters, buy this book and you won't want to put it down. The first movie was good, the book is 10 times better. There is just so much content that is not possible to put in film. If you liked the movie you will be glad you got Ende's original work.
B000JCETC4|5.0|Pay no mind to the brainless idiots out there running their ignorant mouths. If any of those fools had seen the live shows on the OAI tour, they would've been put in their place and understood the beauty of this CD. The guy is 60 years old for Christ's sake. David  was, is and always will be, the man! I had the extreme pleasure of seeing and taping both nights at Radio City Music Hall, back in April 2006, and it was nothing short of incredible. Two of the best shows Ive ever seen/heard in my life and Ive seen some good one's. If you can get your hands on a bootleg of the second night at RCMH, you will understand and hear just how beautiful this CD truly is. Excellent work, David, and shine on old boy, shine on!!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa of the valley of the wind is yet again another great story about the ignorance of mankind. This movie, along with other titles by miyazaki, never fail to humble my agressions. The unrelenting heart that Hayao Miyazaki portrays here is a spectacle to behold, reminding us all of the compassion we are capable of. Paralleling the greed of our negligence that we as a society hold towards our own planet, the story of Nausicaa is here told in the gentle yet firm style of this master of story telling and production genius.

0316172324|4.0|If you are looking for a self-help book to give you an \\"edge\\", don't buy Blink. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a Grand Unified Theory of \\"thin-slicing\\", don't buy \\"Blink\\" <br /> <br />If you are expecting some sort of simple, linear, single-facted description of subconscious human cognition, don't buy \\"Blink\\" <br /> <br />However, if you are interested in a readable (or listenable, I own the audiobook version) introduction to the concepts surrounding rapid cognition (i.e. sometimes less data and quicker decision-making is better than more data and exhaustive analysis), then I believe you'll enjoy this book and learn much from it. <br /> <br />Just for fun, I decided to look over the reviews starting with the lowest ratings. The complaints about this book seem to fall into a few main categories: <br /> <br />1) It doesn't provide an overarching theory to tie together all of the examples......This is a true statement. However, the field that Gladwell is trying to cover ranges from face-reading to margarine marketing to military strategy to inner-city hospital triage to picking out good strawberry jam. While they all share commonalities, it's probably fair to say that there currently is NO grand theory that ties it all together. <br /> <br />2) Gladwell contradicts himself.....Yes, because rapid cognition doesn't always yield superior results. He goes into some of the reasons why this is so. Again, the topic is too multi-faceted to come up with a statement like \\"Use rapid cognition except in circumstance X\\". It just isn't that cut-and-dried. <br /> <br />3) Gladwell doesn't explain how to get better at rapid cognition....No he doesn't, because the solutions for improving rapid cognition are highly dependent upon the individual situation. It can be as complex as spending years watching videotape or tasting food. Or, it can be as simple as basing a heart attack diagnosis on only 4 symptoms. Or closing your eyes when listening to a leader trying to persuade you, so that you don't fall victim to \\"Tall Person Bias\\". <br /> <br />4) This stuff is common sense.....NO IT ISN'T. If this stuff was common sense, we would all use rapid cognition appropriately and not fall victim to its shortcomings. Then, fake Kouri would not fool museum curators, the average height of Fortune 500 CEOs would match the population average, and people would buy competing brandies based on taste, not on packaging. There are numerous examples in the book of our \\"common sense\\" being at odds with reality. One could say that fact is one of the main themes of the book. <br /> <br /> <br />5) Gladwell's work is not academically rigorous.....No, it isn't. The book is not aimed at people with PhDs in neuroscience. It's aimed at a general audience and I believe Gladwell's intent is to spur interest in the topic so that readers will investigate further on their own. <br /> <br /> <br />6) Gladwell's examples/anecdotes are repetitive....I have to concede that critics have a point. I think Gladwell repeats too much because he's trying to illustrate commonalities between different situations, even if he doesn't have a unifying explanation for those commonalities. <br /> <br /> <br />7) Gladwell cover's too much ground/doesn't give enough detail for each example....Again, the critics have a point. Perhaps Gladwell should have focused on fewer examples. In his defense, I think part of his enthusiasm for the topic is that rapid cognition appears in so many areas of decision -making. In his attempt to demonstrate its breadth, he fails to get enough depth. Given that Gladwell was writing for a general audience, he probably couldn't do both. <br /> <br /> <br />In summary, the content of the book is worthy of 5 stars. Take off a half-star each for Gladwell's repetitiveness and questionable choice on the breadth/depth balance.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|My title for this review pretty much says it all.  The Open Door was a disappointing showing for Evanescence.  Fallen was one of my absolute favorite cds, and I was expecting nothing less from this one.  The songs were average, and the ones that were good, seemed like they came right off of Fallen.  Over all, its an ok listen, but I'd just rather listen to my old one...
1844137864|5.0|This huge full color album chronicles the many works of the graffiti artist, Banksy.  The book not only includes full color photos of his urban works, but anecdotal descriptions of many of the pieces.  A beautiful book for either a coffee table or art book collection.  Everyone I have showed it too loves it.
B000065BPB|5.0|I play bass guitar in a studio setting, listening through a headphone mixer. I stand close to the drums and keyboards and these headphones block out all of the unwanted frequencies except for some of the bass drum thump - but even that is not so intrusive as to be distracting. Very ruggedly built. Great sound quality. Can double as hearing protection or ear muffs in cold weather, (if you happen to be a fellow red-neck).
B00019PDKC|5.0|I don't like to throw 5 star reviews around when there are so many other ones here, but considering the play time this disc has received in my car, I can't justify anything less.  It's not as heavy or over the top like some of their old milestone albums, but there's an underlying seriousness to this one that, in many ways, is much more effective.  Interestingly, my least favorite track is the title track, but the entire album works well to listen to from start to finish.  No matter how much Anathema has changed, I feel like they still make songs that I have no problems identifying with.  It's not perfect, and, yeah, some parts work better than others, but I can overlook those flaws because I never get the sense that they don't stand behind their music.  It's a great album, and I hope listeners will allow time to have it grow on them.
B00006399Z|5.0|I had the album from the early 70's. It was one of my favorites but got too scratched to play. The CD is great-as good as I remember but with out all of the scratchs.
6305428425|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over and laugh so hard every time I watch it!  It is so much fun!!
0743556003|5.0|I loved the story and bought the book on CD unabridged
B00008CLOA|5.0|Masterpeice...still stands up 33 years later. Was lucky enough to see Roger Water peform DSOTM this past September. It was pretty incredible.  <br />Great total Pink Floyd effort as opposed to RW will on the band...David Gilmour is great. Enjoy.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I was a bit skepical about this recording, but was pleasently surprised. I found it very enjoyable to listen to. I'm glad the the 'Peppers are still making good music. If you haven't bought anything from them since \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" get this one, you'll like it
B000HT3Q3M|1.0|Lousy. I tried to listen but finally gave up.  Presented my neighbor with the CD since he has kids who act nuts.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is almost a classic movie -- I'm no prude but I there's excessive, gratuitous language that will keep this from being a Jimmy Steward, Forrest Gump kind of classic.  The characters.  The lines.  The stapler.  What more can I say?  See this movie.
0859537978|4.0|my husband just started driving a school bus and we bought this book to let the grandchildren know what pop pop did.  they understood perfectly and now refer to the driver as pop pop.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This videodisc of \\"Metropolis\\" shows the FULL version of the film for the first time since 1936, plus a long documentary on how it was made, and other features -- so it was a good bargain.  It also has the original 1927 orchestral background music; to be honest, I wasn't greatly impressed by this, and would have preferred a new score.  Never mind, my friend and I agreed that the film is (to quote the label) \\"the crowning achievement of the German silent cinema\\", and that the videodisc is a splendid restoration.  (I rather think that this was the first film with a substantial part for a ROBOT -- it must have been a great novelty at the time!)
0060776579|5.0|Was so inspired that I also bought the book, then passed it on to my daughter.  We also gave 4 copies of the print book as gifts,  to friends and other family members for the holidays. <br /> <br />I enjoy the CD's and listen to them in the car, but also feel with this message you need it in print also.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a fantastic movie: fun, bright, humorous, fast-paced, romantic, and fantastical.  The main character is a sweet girl who lives in a world of dreams.  During the journey of this movie, she learns to live in reality by helping others live their dreams.  It is a beautiful movie with a lot of heart.  This is one of my favorite movies!
1896597890|4.0|Its a great book that gives an interesting insight conveyed in a creative manner.  I'm oddly curious about the workings of North korea and this seemed like a great way to learn a little more about this secretive country.  The comics themselves are cute and clear and the monochromatic slides portray the country as it seems it probabaly is in real life.
B00006YXE4|5.0|DVD was formatted for UK and would not play.  However the seller was extremenely responsive and will issue a refund.
B0000033K2|5.0|This is a truly great box set.<br /><br />First, the music. While I think the peaks of Coltrane's Impulse! years exceed the peaks of his Atlantic years, these Atlantic recordings are astonishingly and consistently strong from start to finish, and document one of the most interesting (and rapid) progressions in Jazz history.<br /><br />Second, these are nicely mastered - great sound!<br /><br />Third, the liner notes are actually well-written and interesting, with a nice mix of personal and musical history from different writers and musicians.<br /><br />The 7th disc is arguably only for the hardcore music-geek fan, but it's worth at least a listen or two to just about anyone.<br /><br />A box set of great music packaged just right.  Love it!
B00011F5DK|5.0|My daughter and I are hooked on Blokus.  We play it nearly every night.  It is very challenging and does a great job of helping her concentrate and look for strategies.  This game is great for tweeners thru adults.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I recently saw Rear Window on cable, unfortunately I only saw the first half hour.  So I decided to buy it because I HAD to see how this movie unfolded, and I'm glad I did.  Only Hitchcock can pull off a mystery like this and I couldn't imagine anyone else but Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in the roles of the two main characters.  It's unfortunate that Grace left acting to become royalty in Monaco because the world missed out on a great actress.  Long story short....don't miss out on this film because it's truly a classic.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Great - excellent condition of item. Would do business again. Great shipping - came in on time!
6304806418|4.0|the stage musical is brought successfully to the screen.  This movies captures the woman and her times.  Banderas is the perfect foil to Madonna's Evita.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|It's been fun watching John Mayer's music develop over the fast few years.  This album is completely different than his earlier, more pop sounding songs.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed those albums too.  But Continuum is John Mayer's best album to date.  To me, it feels like an old Rhythm & Blues album with a more modern sound.  If you want to know what Mayer's music is really like, this is the album for you.
0060899190|5.0|The book is in total excellent condition.. and the shipping was exceptionally fast!! Which was great, because I couldn't WAIT to get my hands on it and was not very patient about waiting!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I had seen a few of the episodes for the first season of this show and enjoyed them, but now that I have been able to watch the full, unedited season, I am totally hooked!  The show has a continuing storyline that makes it that much better, when you can watch the episodes in sequence.  The show it really exceptionally well done, with great writing, effects and acting.  I highly recommend it!
0143036742|5.0|I was a little skeptical of the book because of the title.  Talk about judging a book by its cover!  Was I in for a wonderful surprise.  The book is wonderfully original and the characters well drawn.  I laughed out loud at certain parts, but was also quite moved by the seriousness of the story.  It's a remarkable story about family and secrets and how we, as adults, are returned to childhood roles when dealing with family of origin issues.  Don't miss this one.
B000002H97|5.0|Since Metallica has only put out 5 good albums (Kill 'em all, Master Of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, ...And Justice For All, The Black Album (being this one)), I will say that this album is for any metal fan. It is the album that proved all of Metallica's talent. The album starts off with a bang, and dosen't let up. I think that THE BLACK ALBUM might just be the best abum of the 90's. My favorite songs are \\"Enter Sandman, \\"Sad But True\\", \\"My Friend OF Misery\\", \\"The Struggle Within\\", \\"Of Wolf and Man\\", and \\"Through The Never\\". So forget that ST. ANGER crap, this is the real deal.
1402713185|5.0|my son is 19 years old, in jail and is finally trying to read and is enjoying it! thank you for having the classics starts, it's not heavy reading but it was exciting as he can accomplish reading a book in 2-3 days! it gives him accomplishment!
B00005MP58|5.0|Wondeful miniseries!  It is so well acted; the scenery is lush, and the costumes were gorgeous.  Highly recommend this miniseries to others to watch.  Great to view on a rainy day.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|To be honest, speaking as a diehard Evanescence fan, when I first listened to this album, I wasn't all that impressed by it. BUT give this album a chance! Don't let the pop-sounding \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" discourage you from liking the rest of the album. \\"Lithium\\" and \\"The Only One\\" will make up for this. <br />For me, I thought that any other album that Amy Lee created would not be able to top her last album, Fallen. However, I don't think I could compare Fallen to The Open Door because of how different the two albums are. The Open Door is just as powerful as Fallen. The biggest diffence between the two albums is that I feel that The Open Door has more empowering lyrics and melodies; whereas Fallen is powerfully self-loathing. It's as if Amy has seen the light in her life and I think her music in this album refelcts this. Another noticeable difference between the two albums is the lyrics. In Fallen, there was un underlying meaning to her words; whereas in this album, most of her songs are what they are, without losing her poetic style. Her signature haunting melancholiness and sense of mystery is still present in this album, but there's a sense of hope and strength, which gives The Open Door a unique musical edge.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I keep telling my friends that they have never heard the Beatles like this. I was blown away, hearing details in the music I had no recollection of whatsoever...and I was a huge Beatles Fan, like all little girls. Gave a copy to my son in Iraq to share with a note that if it is true that music is universal, THIS is a  fine example.
0786930640|5.0|I read this book at age 14 and now at my 30's i had to buy <br />this hardcover for my fantasy collection books. <br />Starting reading from the beginning, I'm excited again. <br />This trilogy will be definitely remembered for ages !
B00004TWZF|2.0|If you love this movie, then you should get the Director's Cut, because there is lots more movie to love. I bought this for my husband who said it was one of his favorites from when he was younger, and when we watched it he couldn't remember why he loved it so much other than the beautiful cinematography. I thought it was very \\"French\\" in that \\"ooookkkaaay, what was the point?\\" kinda way. But what do I know, I'm just a typical boorish American.  ;o) Anyway, it was eternal and I'd rather watch HD's Sunrise Earth for three hours than watch this again.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|First off, let me say that the new BG is arguably the best science fiction series ever seen on TV. The acting, design, and plot is orders of magnitude better than those of the 1978 series. There is really no comparison--and no need for die-hard fans of the original series to feel threatened by this one. They are apples and oranges. Admittedly, the new show would not have resonated as it does in a pre-9/11 world. But I think the sense of paranoia that permeates BG harks back to the Cold War mood of the B scifi films made in the US in the 1950s, to great effect. <br /> <br />That said, the other great thing about BG is the music. This is not the grandiose, orchestral SF score we're using to hearing from John Williams or the late Jerry Goldsmith. It breaks new ground, with its mix of Middle Eastern woodwinds, Japanese taiko drums, and heavy use of chorale pieces, both wordless and in Gaelic and Sanskrit. And again, not to denigrate Williams. It's simply that Gibbs/McCreary go in a totally different direction, and they do it brilliantly. <br /> <br />I first bought Gibbs' score of the miniseries, which thankfully became the pilot for a series I follow with great enthusiasm. It stands on its own very well, yet establishes a deep, textural mood for the post-holocaust remnant of the human race, as well as for the Cylons, whose \\"plan\\" seems to be to join with their human creators by creating a hybrid race, fulfilling their destiny in a kind of apotheosis. These are certainly not the \\"toaster\\" characters from the Glen Larson series, though I still have a fondness for Andy Probert's centurion design. <br /> <br />Getting back to the Season One score: This music really builds on what Gibbs had done, capturing moods from standout episodes and even coming close to establishing Wagnerian leitmotifs for some of the characters, or at least the relationships between them. The \\"Prologue\\" is a nice brief, ominous rendition of the Cylon cue from the pilot, that we hear at the start ofeach episode, and is a nice treat, as are the US and UK versions of the main title (variations on a theme, really), which serve as \\"bookends\\" to the CD. <br /> <br />Celtic flutes beatifully capture Adama's love for his son in A Good Lighter, and this is reprised with male chorale and is fleshed out in Wander My Friends. Two Funerals is a mournful, militaristic piece which recalls the US version of the Main Title, where Card Game and especially Two Boomers are more operatic tracks which seem to include some synth and/or electric guitar. <br /> <br />Some guilty pleasures can be found in Battlestar Operatica, The Dinner Party, and Battlestar Muzaktica, which make use of female vocals and are among the lightest of the tracks. The score would otherwise be unrelentingly heavy, I think, and not as much a pleasure to listen to. <br /> <br />For me, the masterstrokes of the score are Passacaglia and the similar Shape of Things to Come. These two tracks relate to a vision given by Six to Baltar of \\"their child.\\" Passacaglia is a sweeping, requiem-sounding piece which moved my nearly to tears, and Things to Come is a briefer, more triumphant denouement piece. This passacaglia form is expanded upon further in Allegro in the Season Two score. <br /> <br />In sum, I think that the baton has been seemlessly passed from Gibbs to McCreary. Gibbs took on the formidable task of musical exposition for what would become a series, and McCreary's work builds on it nicely, is less monolithic, and takes the listener in ever-new directions as we continue to follow our intrepid heroes through the galaxy in search of Earth. I can say with confidence that the Season Two score is better still, and I only hope that a Season Three score becomes available soon.
9589494722|5.0|I listened to this CD set while driving. First, the production qualities are oustanding. The text is read clearly, thoughfully, and in a way which engages your attention. Bravo! Then of course, the story itself is much much more than a child's tale. Brilliant!
B00011F5DK|5.0|Purchased this game as a gift.  It was a tremendous hit with all ages.
074356619X|5.0|I especially enjoyed the format - the audio CD set - that I purchased. I turned out the lights, lit some candles and just listened. This is something you really have to pay attention to. You can't just play it in the background while you are doing something else around the house. If you buy the book version, you must really comprehend what you are reading and put it into practice. \\"The Secret\\" really works. I've actually been using it my whole life & I can attest to the fact that you can turn your dreams into reality using this method. Try it. You won't be disappointed.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I found this CD to be a wonderful twist on loved,old favorites.  I recommend this to any Beatles lover who has most of their music.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This CD was one of the most enjoyable complilations of music I have heard. James still has a rich sensitive voice and his rendition of \\"River\\" by Joni Mitchell was just mesmerizing.  I will probably listen to this CD throughout the year because it is so soothing and lovely to listen to.
B000IU3XU6|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this cd. The selections did not move me. <br /> <br />I have another of Josh Groban's albums and I enjoy that much better than this one.
B000059LGC|4.0|Peter Ustinov again doing a superb job as Hercule Poirot although far from Miss Christie's description of Poirot.  Great supporting cast in one of AC's great stories.  Well written, well acted, well photographed.  Mystery fun for everyone.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I love this Movie, it's so different from the any film that i've ever seen
0790729393|4.0|This movie is depressing, dark and a real eye-opener.  Good cast, and good court-room drama.  A strong cast and solid performances make this movie a must watch.
0385339682|4.0|If you expect to get a typical Grisham action-packed thriller here, look elsewhere.   <br /> <br />Technically this is a good book.  I enjoyed the story about Willy and his newspaper-owning life.  It's a rather typical story about a murderer that doesn't get what he deserves.  This is meant to make the reader hate \\"justice\\" and wonder how people can get away with such crimes.  (If you read enough, you'll notice that this is a fairly common line.  Writers need to be able to take the story in a direction that rarely, if ever, occurs in real life.)  It's not a true story.  It's meant to be entertaining. <br /> <br />We find out who the real killer (of some jury members) is near the end.  It's a bit of a twist, but predictable when you realize it's not who the author made you think it was at first.  It takes a lot of reading to get to the meat... not always bad.  There is more than one story here, and it's difficult, at times, to figure out which story line is the main subject.  I think the title is a bit misleading as well.  I think \\"Life Sentence\\" could work. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed the break from Grishamism.
B000GTJT16|5.0|VERY GOOD FILM IN ALL SENSE. VERY GOOD QUALITY OF HD DVD
0060794410|5.0|This book has excellent insight on what it takes to not only make a business sucessful, but same principles can apply to your daily life.  Great book.
6305127697|4.0|In my opinion, this movie was Edward Norton's best performance (yes, even better than Fight Club).  For a movie that will really leave you stunned, this is one great movie!
B000AXWV40|5.0|George Clinton's crew.WOW!!  Black-funk-soul rock!!!   Guitar solos with funk-filled soul!!!  Funkadelic was the REAL FUNK before any generation could lay claim to it!!! Now that's the truth!  Buy this for your collection, if you don't own MAGGOT BRAiN, then your collection is so imcomplete.  Sit back and enjoy, Free your mind.....
B00004YZ36|5.0|The delivery time from Amazone was shorter than I expected. <br />And I have been very satisfied with the CDs. <br /> <br />Thanks.
B000FIMG68|3.0|The second year was not as good as the first year.  Less suspense and on occassion I had to fight off sleep.  I hope year 3 will be better.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|First of all i want to thank all superman fans because of this product. I think superman II Richard Donner cut is direct sequel of superman the movie. Even opening credits is same style of first movie. There is no campy, slapstick gags in this movie like in superman III and Lester's cut. Also music is original not the Ken Thorne's themes like the Lester's cut. Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder's chemistry is awesome, Marlon Brando's scene is excellent because when you see this scenes you understand why in the first movie he said to his son something about father and son. Of course there is some problems in this movie like test screens of Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve but they had to use it.  Richard Donner's cut definitely superior to Lester's campy version.  I pretended that I never watched superman II. If you like superman the movie , you love this cut.
B000I5X80G|2.0|As he said in his previous blues CD. <br /> <br />This is CD captures a live performance.  The sound is dated, sure, but the real Neil Young vibrancy comes through; Cowgirl in the Sand is a keeper.  The rest of the songs, well, it is what it is. <br /> <br />My complaint - the DVD that comes with it.  Are we supposed to believe that a bunch of black and white photos with a movie reel playing in the foreground is really a live performance video?  <br />
B00011F5DK|3.0|Blokus is an OK game.  The kids like it, but it has not caught on well.  Maybe after the new toys of Christmas are older they will use it more.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|A+++++ Love his music.  This tape everything and more.  Great shipping to get it to me before Christmas.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|If you \\"pump iron\\" and remember when this film first appeared, you'll certainly appreciate it now.  Be sure to view the extras.  They are definitely worth it.  Arnold has lost none of his ego.
0743289412|5.0|After reading CELL from Stephen King I was craving for more and better (I was not impressed with Cell as you can tell). And Lisey's Story is definitely MORE and BETTER. This is the Stephen King that has made me stay awake way past a decent bed time and read wherever I can and whenever I can squeeze time out of my day. Fresh story plus traditional (thus great) King narrative style made this read a must for SK fans.
B000ICM5W6|4.0|The major complaint about this under appreciated comic book movie is that it was slow moving.  While I mostly agree with this complaint, I was blessed with an attention span - therefore, while it is drawn out, I had no issue staying involved in the movie, despite the Hulk not being one of the top-tier superheroes. <br /> <br />The HD-DVD treatment is excellent for this title, especially when the viewer finally gets to the action.  While the movie could have been better, it is still good and, over time, will be seen as the cinematic achievement that hasn't been trumpeted as of yet.  <br /> <br />If you appreciate the 'art' of comic books (framing and presentation, especially), then you will love this movie.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|The third disc is the most helpful for film makers. The Koreans have so many little stuff that we all can learn that can save time and money.  <br /> <br />For example, using a peg as a slate.  <br /> <br />There's so much more but I'm not going to spoil it for ya. If you love the film; the colors, the shooting style and the story - Get it!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|This package is the best complement for the film.  The books and extras DVD are great with a wealth of  information about the film and author.  I just wish the lead actors (Firth & Ehle) were involved in the walkabout of the set, but still get this package if you're a fan of the best production of the story.    Thanks, BBC!
B000002KY8|5.0|Prince is a very talented musician and as a fellow musician I see his music as very eclectic and very daring. The album starts off with the smash \\"1999\\" and it is the long version not the radio edit that people are used to. Absolutely one of my favorites and the reason I got into Prince \\"Little Red Corvette\\" is a spectacular rock song that was way ahead of its time. Another one of my favorites is \\"Something In The Water Does Not Compute\\" I just love the sound of the synth in the background. First time I heard \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" I was suprised but, once you get into Prince you realize that's who he is and what he really likes to talk about. Prince's music is known to be controversial to some but to the rest of us he is an amazing all in one icon who wraps up everything plain and simple into a nice piece of vinyl that we immensely enjoy. <br /> <br />The album is purely 80s era and during this period The Purple One heavily wrote dance and party numbers that have kept fans like me begging for more. Dance, Music, Sex, Romance aisdes from the longevity of the track and the thumping bass line it is a hell of a track to jam to. If you purchase this album, you won't regret it. This is a classic for those who like to party and dance. I believe that this album is worth every cent while, also making you come back for more from The Purple One.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|As a fan of the stage (and now screen) version, Phantom was a movie that was destined for High Definition greatness.  The sharp, rich colors and unbelievable detail is worthy of purchase and viewing on its own - all of those features coupled with cutting edge audio makes for one powerful audio/visual experience.   <br /> <br />While some reviewers claim to dislike this film, I prefer it over the stage version, as it flowed better than the off screen original, and, thanks to being on film, is able to be better illustrated than on stage alone. <br /> <br />Phantom in HD-DVD is the way everyone should see it. A wonderful film with wonderful mastering and presentation.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|No, this album is for the true Beatle fan and celebrates their creativity and innovation rather than their successes.  Sure you will get your \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Yesterday\\", but you also get some of the more obscure tunes like \\"Within you and Without You\\" mashed with the bass from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  There are so many small things added (or taken away) from the songs and it's done so skillfully by George Martin and his son that they are sometimes difficult to detect.  One of my favorites is the addition of Paul screaming from \\"Helter Skelter\\" combined with the heavy guitar from \\"She's so Heavy\\" being added to the end of \\"Mr. Kite\\".  Awesome mash album for the true Beatles fan.  If you're expecting a greatest hits album, look elsewhere.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The new and improved Little Mermaid can only be described in one word...stunning! I am only 20 and remember just as I did when it was my favorite movie years ago!! Its a classic and I recommend it for all!!
B000069KGM|4.0|Chicago Transit Authority started off like gang busters.  Their eclectic free form style set the music world abuzz.  They weren't afraid to experiment and this is especially noticeable on their first album.  Their first effort was an fm-radio album format dream.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|If you have seen this movie, you already know that it is fantastic.  By seeing this movie in HD-DVD, know and SEE that it's fantastic! One of the first HD-DVD titles that I purchased, the color saturation is stellar - some of the blackest black hues on a screen that I've ever seen, especially viewed in 1080i/p!!!!!!  Watch the scene where he is painting the batsuit and you'll see what I mean.  The surround sound is one that must be experienced to believe, as well as all the other features.  Batman Begins is a title that should be one of the pillars of your HD-DVD library, regardless of whether or not you like super hero movies or not.
B00008PC2O|2.0|The movie is simply a classic, and a must for any Sci-fi fan. <br />The HD quality was less then good though. I probably did something wrong, but I never really got it to work in a anything that even resembled Hi Definition af 720 or 1080.
6305907145|5.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law and it is on my list of things-to-buy for me.  I consider this to be more weighty and concerned than other Jane Austen works (it's still not my favorite, though).  Fanny is a superb heroine; the filming has a beautiful, still quality to it; and, the social issues dealt with expand beyond class inequality.  I do have to say, though, that the resolution of the love interest is not palatable to me.
0618680004|5.0|In the wake of Sam Harris' and Daniel Dennett's recent books, it might seem that another argument against religion's hold on the human mind would be redundant. But Dawkins -- Oxford's Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science -- brings to it a combination of passion, wit, erudition and clarity that will delight the non-religious and infuriate the religious, but also advance a debate that's become a serious one for believers and non-believers alike.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|Although you won't hear most of these songs on the radio, the majority of the songs on this album are great on thier own.  Amy Lee put a lot of soul in to this album.  Very similar to her last CD.  Her voice is still incredible.  Although it took me a couple times to listen through this CD for me to really like it.
B000G759LW|5.0|Man, this CD will reve you up any time you listen to it.  Christina is an amazing performer.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Al Gore presents, very lively and in a smart way, what is at stake with the environmental issue today. That is : our survival!! The film has not spectacular scenes of typhoons or whatever catastrophy (unless Katrina) but all the figures given give us gooseflesh... Even if we had seen the film already, we are glad to see it again and show it to friends and relatives. Only drawback (for what I did not give 5 stars) : as a French person, this very personal show (we see Al Gore and him again, even if he is quite a handsome man...)is a bit frustrating and the small cartoon at he beginning is quite unnecessary.
B00007K02F|4.0|This is, in my opinion, the best Jane Eyre of them all.  The characters look the part, and the film is beautifully shot and convincingly acted. A great romantic movie.
0618680004|5.0|Here are some of the points you'll find brilliantly argued in this book.<br /><br />* A distinction between the God of Einstein and the God of Abraham. The first is what Albert Einstein meant whenever he used the word God and it's just a poetic way to label the structure of the Universe but it is in no way a personal god. The second is a personal god who if he existed would care about us and talk to us. Dawkins is an atheist in that he does not believe in any personal god such as Odin or Yahwe or Jesus.<br /><br />* A refutation of all the common proofs for God's existence and a case made for not turning to faith in the absence of proof.<br /><br />* A persuasive case made for the non-existence of God, but this case is not a proof since logically you cannot prove the non-existence of anything. Dawkins makes the point that the God of Abraham is as likely to exist as are Odin, Zeus, Jupiter or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. However, the existence of God is logically even more unlikely than the existence of the universe he supposedly created, so onus on religion to prove its case, and NOT on atheists to prove theirs.<br /><br />* A refutation of the thesis that religion is the basis of morality. It turns out that people from different cultural backgrounds and religious affiliations come up with similar solutions when faced with ethical dilemmas. Morality seems to be hardwired in our brains.<br /><br />* A refutation of the thesis that religion is a necessary source of comfort. It can bring solace, but atheism also offers ways to console us through hardships and Dawkins gives many examples. Further, religion can also be a source of anguish, e.g. all those people terrified as children by visions of an imaginary hell.<br /><br />Dawkins tackles more questions. Should we admire people who have faith? Says Dawkins, no. Even if we don't believe, can't we still \\"believe in belief\\", i.e. isn't religion a good thing? Says Dawkins, no. Is raising your child to believe in your religion a form of child abuse? Says Dawkins, yes. If you're an atheist, is it OK to go to a friend's church wedding? Says Dawkins, sure it is.<br /><br />If as a bright you ever need to argue in favour of your naturalistic world view, you'll find this book an invaluable help in articulating your thoughts.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|As a guitar player myself for almost 40 years now, I could enjoy a Mark Knopfler album for just the guitar playing alone.<br /><br />I've said it in other reviews that while there are players around who are technically better players than Mark (they can play 1,000 64th notes in the span of 2 seconds or tap out an entire tune with ten fingers and 8 toes), I don't believe there is a more tasteful player on the planet than Mark Knopfler.<br /><br />But the fact is that he's not only a great player who's a joy to listen to (and to try and emulate), he's also a great songwriter as well who surrounds himself with some of the best musicians around.<br /><br />I have to confess that when I originally bought this CD within hours of its release, I listened to it several times in my car as I would drive to and from work and initially, I wasn't too impressed. My first impression was that it was \\"slow\\" - seemed to lack \\"passion\\"  and just lacked pzazzzzz.<br /><br />After all, this album came out after Sailing To Philadelphia, which I instantly loved and literally played over and over and over again.<br /><br />However, it's now 2007 - a few years after its release and I honestly have to say that this is a great and very \\"easy on the ears\\" cd to listen to. And it's very interesting, but my wife and young son vacationed a few months ago in southern California and spent some time in Malibu (where this album was recorded) and I can better understand the laid-back quality of it. Malibu is a nice community on the Pacific Coast Highway with the ocean on one side of you and these hills / cliffs with palatial multi-million homes) on the other side. It doesn't exactly exude the same type of \\"energy\\" you might feel walking down 5th Avenue In NYC.<br /><br />This album is alot like Mark as a person or Mark as a performer. I've seen him many, many times in concert and you would never confuse his shows with Elton John or Madonna.<br /><br />In fact, my wife and I have butted heads about this as she says that his shows are \\"boring\\". My response is that if boring is great songs being performed by consumate musicians without firey pyrotechnics or women running around in lingerie is boring, then she's right - he's \\"boring\\".<br /><br />Let me close by relaying a personal story about Mark Knopfler, the person.<br /><br />In 1994, my wife committed suicide. While the grief and guilt, at times, seemEd overwhelming, I managed to keep my \\"sanity\\" by pulling out an older Mark Knopfler / Dire Straits CD and trying to figure out how to play a particularily difficult passage. For 1 or 2 or 5 hours each day, I could put aside my \\"pain\\" and just focus on how to play, for example, the solo in Once Upon A Time In The West or Tunnel of Love.<br /><br />I always wanted to thank Mark personally for \\"helping\\" me get through a particularily difficult time in my life - but I am a terrible procrastinator. Even after his motorcycle accident, I still put it off.<br /><br />Finally a few weeks before Christmas this year, I sent an email to Mark Knopfler via a friend of his whose email address I knew.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later, I received two autographed pictures of Mark - one made out to me and one to my new 15 month old son, Brandon (I was married again a couple of years ago).<br /><br />Some day when Brandon is older, a guitar player and as big a fan / admirer of Mark Knopfler as his pop is, I'm going to present him with the framed picture.<br /><br />Thanks, Mark - for both the pictures and your body of work over the last 20 years.<br /><br />And thanks for Shangri-la.

B000IZJZLM|4.0|The voices are still excellent but I did not like the selection of recordings.
B000J103PC|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. Not only does it capture the \\"fabulous\\" scene in the fashion industry, but Meryl Streep brings all the attitude, perkiness, and glamour a movie like this should have.  All the cast members fit perfectly in their role, they have excellent on-screen chemistry, and the story flows on a funny and good paced scale.    The movie contains an excellent soundtrack. From the beginning song \\"Suddenly I See\\" by KT Tunstall, to many classics of Madonna like \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Jump\\", they all keep you in an upbeat mode.    The director made an excellent work capturing the escence of the book, and even improving it. For in the book, \\"Runway\\" editor Miranda Priestly lives with an attitude where it's all about her. In the movie it is more about \\"the industry and all she has created\\". That is better because it creates more glamour than pretentiousness.    Bottom line is do buy this movie, enjoy it, and laugh with your family everytime you watch it.

Give the book a try and you may find that it is the wake-up call that you need too.  If you even think about buying this book, then you should, it means that you're at a point in your life where you're looking for answers or meaning.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|A classic movie is one that will be enjoyed by many people for years and years.  It's a Wonderful Life is definitely a classic.  One of my late husband's favorites that I only just watched this past holiday.  (My husband died at the age of 38 on Aug 11, 06.)  I can still hear my husband doing his Jimmy Stewart impression.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for this movie to be available on DVD!!! I was so excited when Amazon e-mailed me to tell me that it was finally out and I pre-ordered it.  I have watched over and over - I love the story and the chemistry between Barbara and Kris is amazing.  I have the soundtrack downloaded to my I-pod.... what could be better than a burned out rock star marrying and up and coming leading talent?!! Nothing, that is why this movie is so great!!  Trust me, if you love Barbara than you will l.o.v.e this movie!!!

B00008G9JO|5.0|This is just a great album (CD).  I received my original copy, an album, as a gift and have passed this purchase on to a friend.  If you enjoy both the lyrics and the music, get this one.  My favorite is the title song, Heavy Horses...it speaks of a time not so long ago where big, strong, horses did the work for man.  Just imagine.....\\"Iron-clad heavy feet, pounding the dust, An October's day towards evening...sweat-embossed veins standing proud to the plough... salt on a deep chest seasoning.  Last of the line at an honest day's toil...turning the deep sod under...flint at the fetlock, chasing the bone, flies at the nostril's plunder...\\"   So many other great songs.  Add this to your collection.  Michael

The extras are great and there's a little booklet with some additional information. I have enjoyed this purchase immensely. Given that each season is individually upwards of $30, this is a pretty good bargain for only $139!!

B0006A9FMI|5.0|State of the art animation with deep idea behind it. It grabs you right from the start. One can find only the quality of the picture, but there is more and more. Perfecly depicted characters fited in a time wich can come true some day. I think this anime is one of the best there is. And the soundtrack is amazing. Combination between tradition and new motives, the music find you and it holds you till the end.

It's impressive that they were even able to follow up the classic \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\" without a hitch! Buy this album, and let yourself float in the melodies, swim in the solos, bask in the grand vocals, and just enjoy yourself. You deserve this album.
0517543052|5.0|I've only read a few of the previous reviews of this book, and already I've noticed how some have said it changed their lives. Add my name to this list. I had my first encounter with the cosmic on an LSD trip in February of 1978, was terrified at first, and later (with the help of a fellow traveller who'd \\"been there before\\"), relaxed into it and felt joy at the realization that we are, indeed, dual beings. Another fellow traveller then mentioned the books of Ram Dass; I searched out my first copy of BE HERE NOW, and the rest is history.<br /><br />As one wiser than me has stated, \\"Those who know don't speak...and those who speak, don't know.\\" Words do indeed seem to fail me in expressing the importance and timelessness of this book; it put me on a path that I remain on to this day, and along with Neale Donald Walsch's CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD trilogy, I have found the way to knowing who and what God IS, and ISN'T. Whether you're a past or present user of psychedelics is immaterial...if the answers you seek through organized religion have evaded you, as they have millions of other seekers, then I recommend these writings with all my heart and soul. I wish you well on your journey. Namast&eacute; and Om Shanti.....Doug

B000ASATZ8|5.0|My son wanted the Tremor movies and I was thrilled to find them all in one package.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Great movie and very well priced. Took a long time for delivery. I was hoping I can get it by christmas or at least New Year but it was later than that. neverthe less, love it.
B000BKJ78K|3.0|While the digital process seems to have worked well as far as picture <br />quality, you should be aware that these three films are not the original <br />versions; they are the versions that George Lucas has \\"revised\\" to bring <br />them \\"into line\\" with Episodes 1, 2, and 3. For instance, in Episode 4, <br />a scene has been added just after the Cantina scene where Hans Solo <br />has a conversation with Jabba the Hut and some bounty hunters. If you <br />have copies of the original versions of Episodes 4, 5, & 6; you will <br />probably not want to spend money on the new versions.
B000063UR2|5.0|I must admit . . . I originally saw the movie because of the soundtrack.  I am a huge Tangerine Dream fan, as well as Brian Ferry.  I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's ability to take me to a very believable fantasy world.  The lighting and special effects were quite good for the time.  The scenes in which Tim Curry were present had a very dark, forboding feel.  The overall movie is a great time if you like the fantasy genre.
0671015206|5.0|This book is more like a research project than a book. What I love about it is the \\"facts\\" that we don't see on tv. In most cases, if you ask someone who are some of the millionaires in America they would name people in sports, movies, or music artist. In the book it names who the real majority of millionaires are and common qualities in all of them.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a great family movie. Get set for lots of laughter, and numerous great songs from the past.
0743289412|5.0|Stephen King hasn't lost his touch.  If you like Stephen King, you'll defininetly like this book.  Great story...finished it in a weekend.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is an excellent CD and has everything we were looking for.  Amazon was easy to use with fast delivery and great quality.  It fills a tremendous need.
1582701709|5.0|This book has changed my life!  If you will listen to ur thoughts u will realize that what u \\"think\\" is what will happen or HAS happened.  You bring everything u think about into ur life.  Think about what u want and need and it will become reality.  IT WORKS!!!!
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a great series which has everything you could want from a show - hot actors, drama, comedy, excitement etc etc and it really gets you hooked on the individual characters. Would definetely recommend to anyone!
0618680004|4.0|This book is hard hitting with some chapters easier to read while others go very deep philosophically. No holds barred.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you haven't already bought this set, get on the case! I love the main  characters and the individual stories behind each episode are awesome. This series is a real gripper and not only uses myths and legends past, but creates its own a well. I can't wait for season 2
B000003N8R|5.0|This is classic Coltrane. For all jazz aficionados who can appreciate the improvisational lyricism and depth of this genius's music. It's also a great album for listeners who can't take the intense, explosive solos of his later journeys.
0618680004|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot!  The author's explanations are clear and easy to understand.  His explorations of possible evolutionary mechanisms that have predisposed humans to supernatural beliefs are very plausible.  A very interesting and thoughtful read.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, you really owe it to yourself to check it out.  The writing is amazing, and the casting is as close to perfect as it gets.  Great show, and a very reasonably priced DVD set.  Definatly worth every penny.
B000268QB2|5.0|I purchased this CD and was hooked right away. It has many great catchy songs. I then got the follow-up CD and DVD.
B000I0QK74|5.0|If you love James Taylor then you will be very happy if you buy this CD. I always say that if God has a voice it will sound like his! Listening to him sing is truly a balm to my soul. It instantly calms me.
B00005MKA3|5.0|This Cd is very very good, have almost the best songs from Bob and this version is remastered becoming the quality of the song better. If you like reggae music, good songs, Bob Marley and sound with Hi quality, Survival is a good choice. All the Best and Jah Rastafari!!!
0399208534|5.0|This book is a classic.I bought it for my Grandson,and he loves it.He now has a little Brother,and he also loves it.You can't go wrong with books,and tis one is a treasure.If you only buy one book,make it this one.
0743289412|5.0|I had this book from the Library, too long to finish in the time allowed.  So I just had to buy it.  It arrived very quickly after being purchased.  It is a great intertwined story from a great story teller:  Stephen King.
B00006BTCA|4.0|This album is dark and moody with guitar that sometimes reminds one of the Smiths, but with interesting rythms that recall something of the Pixies.  I don't often hear music that reminds me of so many other bands, without being a copy of any one of them, so imagine a cross between The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Smiths, The Pixies, REM, but all done in a dark NY style.  Very, very good.
B000GFLAI0|3.0|After seeing Martin Scorsese's documentary on Bob Dylan which aired on PBS, I was amazed by how much influence Bob had on the music scene in the 1960's and 1970's.  I was around then, but I guess I didn't pay much attention...I was young then.  The documentary is amazing, the CD was a let down for me.  Alas, my husband loves it so it was worth the buy.  I prefer Bob's older songs and influences.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|This is the music you can use to explain to someone why you are addicted to Tom Waits.  And the best thing about it will be that they still won't understand.
B0008KLW7M|5.0|Okay...Harry rules.The books are great and the movies are fun.I admit that this is the first of the four movies that start to show the darker side of Harry's world.The kids will love it and I find that a lot of adults do to.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. He loves Batman!! But Kate Holmes is horrible in it. They should have gotten someone better because she killed it!
B000H5U832|5.0|My whole family really enjoyed this movie!  It is a great family movie!  The movie has good music in it as well!  Overall, we thought that \\"Cars\\" was an excellent movie!
B000A7DVRC|5.0|My grown children and several friends have said for years that I needed to see this movie.  Well, I'm not disappointed.  It is very funny.  A friend that watched it with me, who grew up in North Idaho, said that the film characters reminded him of several guys he had know while growing up. <br /> <br />There is a lot of foul language, so avoid this if offended by such.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Songs from the Wood is the first Tull album I ever listened to years ago. It is still one of my favorites. I would recommend this album to anyone who would like to look into the \\"non-famous\\" Tull works ie \\"Thick as a Brick\\" (which is great in its own right).
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|This CD is pretty fun. I like all the songs except the Mama, we're all going to hell song. It's good.
1881273156|5.0|You may give gifts.  You may be a hugger.  Maybe even a note writer.  Possibly one to do special unannounced favors, or give your day to be with someone.  But can you juggle all of these at once?  That is what I got from Gary Chapman's book.  We need to be speaking all of these if we want our relationships to run on all cylinders.  I heartily \\"AMEN!\\" this book.  Get your marriage off the ground, turn into a \\"get-er-done\\" guy at work.  Be the old dog that learns a new trick.  This is the one you want to learn.  Your spouse will wonder what came over you.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer explores more Blues in this CD. It's really good but it isn't as poppy as his last CDs. John Mayer is great on the guitar and knows how to make great music.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Love it, Love it, Love it! The CD is wonderful and the concert DVD- phenomenal. His performance was very uplifting and energized and made me want to get up and dance in my livingroom. With todays \\"music\\" being what it is, I found Michael Buble a breath of fresh air and I can't wait for his next CD.
B0000657UB|4.0|An album with a crucial sound for the time, and quite lovely. BUT: While Sandy Denny has a great voice, she tends to sound the same song to song. Steeleye Span's Maddy Prior, for example, is more distinctive and flexible. As well, the songs on LIEGE AND LIEF tend to be of a standard 4/4 rock beat, though the album is hailed as the premiere or seminal English folk-rock recording. That's wrong. Not enough variation, not enough flowing with the texures and beats of the traditional material they play. For those who hear this jewel but would like something more of the traditional folk spirit you detect, try BELOW THE SALT, by Steeleye Span. It's that band's best album and it subtracts about 40% of the rock element. Felt more by far is the influence Ashley Hutchings, founder of both bands.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Did you see what you think you saw! This was the best entertainment<br /><br />I enjoyed in a long While. I have to watch it several more times to REALLY SEE IT!
B000I5X80G|3.0|Why would Amazon ask me to review something I never received?  I ordered this item from a \\"z\\" merchant. After waiting the suggested 3 weeks to receive it, I reported the failure to receive to Amazon.  Amazon's response was to wait 2 more weeks.  Eight weeks later and I still haven't received it.  At least the merchant finally acknowledged that fact and credited my payment back.  I'm not sure Amazon has realized it yet. <br /> <br />Regarding the actual CD, I'm sure it's good; however, I'll have to purchase it somewhere else to find out.
0735619670|5.0|Don't think twice, just buy this book. This book has the knowledge that they didn't have the time to teach in all those computer science classes. Its worth it just for the overview of software architecture and use of pseudocode. If you write code, buying this book is a no brainer. Thanks Steve McConnell!
B000FQ4M58|4.0|OK... first off... I like Bat I and II. But I won't gush over them. To me, Meatloaf has always had a lot of good songs, some great songs and a lot of filler and throw away songs. Bat III does away with the filler. There's no 45 Seconds of Ecstacy here (apologies to those of you who LIKE that mess). Even the oddball 1.5 minute song (Monstro) works very well as a segue into Land of Pigs. Yes- this is a long album. So what? I'd rather have 78 minutes that includes a few less than stellar tracks than 50 minutes of great songs... if the price is the same (and hey, I paid 10 bucks for Bat III!!!), at some point I will listen to the songs that aren't as exciting, and they often grow on me anyway. And there is some REALLY good music on this album. I bought it because I like a lot of Meatloaf and the price was good. It goes way above my expectations so it's all good. Even if you are a casual fan of Meatloaf- pick this one up. It's worth the money.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The real inconvenient truth is that this mockery of a documentary is blatantly skewed towards junk science and political convenience.  It plays on basic human fears that we are not in control of our lives or destiny and therefore have a crisis *now* that threatens our very existence.  It fails to give proper perspective to the whole of the Earth's history but rather plays up recent (and rather spotty) measurements. <br /> <br />The doomsday crowd will be overly excited over this release because it validates their paranoia.  Be very wary of Kyoto Accord code-speak as it presents a single sided argument.  Why, how can anyone disagree with clean air and water - that's inhuman.  Of course it is, and nobody ever said they were in favor of dirty water and air.  The questions is how reliable are the facts and motives of those giving the \\"facts\\" versus the economic cost of taking extreme action that isn't even proven needed yet.  This piece of fiction sets up it's own skewed questions before giving a predictable answer.  That's like having the students make up the questions then provide the answers. <br /> <br />This really must the the most lopsided presentation of \\"facts\\" I have ever seen, and I nearly fell for it before doing the most basic regiment of research on my own.  The only thing you should really fear is how unscrupulous the producers are and how gullible the sycophants are.  Maybe one day these people with just go away and adults without an agenda can rationally decide what to do, or even if it's a real problem rather than cyclical changes to the Earth and Sun. <br /> <br />
B000IU3XU6|4.0|I would argue that Closer is probably the best of the Josh Groban cds thus far, but maybe that is just because the style there appeals a little more to me than the rest and I have liked those songs more.  This cd has some songs with kind of a different feel, but that's fine because more of the same might have been overkill.  In any case, Josh Groban is still amazing and I can't wait to see him live!
0060776757|5.0|If you are a U2 Fan, this product is fantastic!  The pictures alone are worth the purchase.  The book is filled with photos of each band member which include lots of personal and childhood photos. There is no other place where you can get an inside view of U2 in their own words.  It is also a perfect coffee table book that starts a lot of great conversations.
0691084459|5.0|Not for the faint of heart.  Well written, but very technical.  Needs good math and physics background.
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie is great.  The cars seem human and the animation is amazing. I bought this movie for my husband's birthday.  He has watched it over and over again.  Disney continues to wow us with unforgetable entertainment.
0743556003|5.0|So glad Stephen didn't really quit publishing novels, after The Dark Tower series.   <br />
1400077915|4.0|It is the first book by Alice Munro that I read and I have to say that it is quite good. I recommend it.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Dream Theater steps it up to the next level.  With the Octavarium Orchestra, they rocked out as I had expected.  They always seem to enjoy themselves on stage.  The chemistry that exists between them is something that you don't see often in bands today.  I am happy for Dream Theater and the success that they are having.  They are not afraid to improve,and this performance proves that.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|<br />. . . but if you are a fan of this 1966 classic, arguably the best car racing film ever made, then you *must* see this version. I'm a huge fan - saw it when it came out and have been moderately obsessed with the film since - and I've been muddling along with the VHS for a decade. <br /> <br />Now I can see the quality (if not the size) of the original Cinerama film, enjoy the full fidelity of the gorgeous Maurice Jarré score, and see two excellent Speedvision documentaries about the film and 60s F1. Along with a promotional film from the period about the making of. Interviews, then and now, with Frankenheimer and some of the stars (Jimmy G. isn't lookin' too great these days!) The insights into Frankenheimer and his method are fantastic.  <br /> <br />If you've never seen the film, don't expect much of a story, but the in-car racing footage has never been equalled in a feature film. That combined with the music and sound make for a very rewarding experience.
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Most Definetely one of the best new trance proposals of 2006
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was most impressed with the facts presented in this documentary.  people have made movies before on such topics but I have never seen anything like this.  No spin, just facts.  A must see if you care about our childrens future.
B000FVQYZY|5.0|In short: this is just a cool album if you like modern electronic rock! The sound is cool and snappy, with a catching melodious touch to most of the songs. Highly recommended ... and if play CD's in something that'll handle a DVD, then the Absolution album is in the box too ;-)
0385484518|5.0|This is a beautiful story that will make you cry and change your life.  If you never read another book in your life, read this one.  This book never got the recognition it deserved.  Also, see the movie...the movie followed the book perfectly and will give you a face to put with the names.  Just wonderful!
0743201140|5.0|This book and talent assessment seems to be very accurate and helpful.  I've used it with two different work teams to better understand where to focus development needs and as a team-building exercise.  Our team revealed their top 5 Strengths to each other with commentary and discussion.  The team members reported stronger bonds because of hearing personal stories that explained Strengths.  As the leader of the team, it gave me a perspective on the balance of Strengths in my team.  This information helps me to better assign work and align team members to be more successful.  We loved the book and the exercise and are in a better position now to discuss development plans.
B000BMYWYC|5.0|This is the best you can get, but the shipping was as much as the product. That would be my only complaint is they charge to much for shipping for a small bottle.  I paid $4.00 per bottle I ordered for shipping which is about the same as purchase for each bottle. Other than that I would recommend this product for all the model builders.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I was familiar with a few of Billy Joel's songs, but I thought my disc collection would not be complete if I did not own a good sample of his material. <br />This product proposes a chronological approach and that suited me just fine. The two discs are loaded with all the classics. All of them wonderfully digitalized. I was able to appreciate the enormous range of Billy Joel. Great songwriter, great singer, great piano player. Although I am drummer, I do understand why people like him, or Sting, or Stevie Wonder, or Elton John, are on top of the music industry food chain. It is truly difficult to be able to master so many areas of music. And I am not talking about the performing, the band leading chores, the musical direction, production, publicity, all these extra skills to own in order to arrive where they are.  <br />Getting one hit out is already a rare feat, but 35 or 40 like the ones presented in this compilation, require a truly great mind (something many one hit wonders wish to have). <br />I love this compilation. A great buy!
0307237699|5.0|WONDERFUL BOOK. EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT. HOPE YOU WILL. RECOMMEND
B00006JSS8|5.0|I was familiar with Stevie Wonder's work through the radio, never owned anything of his. I was looking for an album that would get me a solid introduction to this artist. I was very happy with this C.D. The songs go chronologically, they encompass a wide range of styles and they are well digitalized.  <br />This album certainly made me realise the truly astonishing power of this musician. Gorgeous melody line, intricate orchestration, virtuosity in voice, harmonica, piano, superb composition. You can enjoy the songs at many different levels. What a brillant artist, what a good selection of songs.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie.  Although, it is narrarated by Al Gore, it is not political; it brings up issues of the environment and ways of how we can help.   A definite must see!
B000001FS3|4.0|This album, to me, is really really slow.  I really love the first three songs.  I love the whole cd, but it can get a little boring.  It's a slow album compared to most of their other ones, and some points feel like there should just be more there.  It is amazing for a slower album, and U2 masters the slow songs beautifully, but it's not, nor has it ever been, my favorite U2 album.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|When I rented this movie, everybody groaned.  I guess it just became not-cool to see X-Men by this third offering, and my family was susceptible to the bad reviews and hearsay from friends.  I liked the first two X-Men installments for what they were, fairly clean-cut comic book escapism with well-done computer graphic effects.    This movie did not disappoint me when it came to fulfilling those same expectations.  I liked the simple plot, the integrity of the characters (whether good or evil) and the effects.  I stayed engaged the whole time.    In fact, the fetching Mrs. Brew and the kids had an errand to run, and told me to watch it by myself, they weren't interested.  They returned when the movie was half-way through, and got sucked in and couldn't tear themselves away.  Hahaha, joke's on them.    Anyway, what I liked most in this potato chip was the bond that Magneto and Prof X had, even though they were bitter rivals and at times seeming enemies.  When Prof X met his fate, Magneto was distraught.  Afterward, he laments his passing with words of praise.    Famke Janssen as Jean Grey was beautiful and indifferent in her fury and reminded me of Cate Blanchett in LOTR (during Galadriel's \\"test of the ring\\" scene).    Although I wouldn't spend cash to obtain this DVD, I would certainly watch it again as a rental or on TV.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have never been a Dylan fan.  I grew up in the 60s and heard all his popular music back then, but was no particular fan.  I had never bought any Bob Dylan album in the past. But one day while at work recently, I was listening to an online NPR radio station and an unfamiliar song came on that stopped me in my tracks. It was Nettie Moore from Modern Times, an album I heard about but had not listened to.  I was so taken that I immediately logged onto Amazon to buy the album.  And to my surprise, Nettie Moore is only one of a collection of outstanding songs. I can't stop listening to this CD!  I play it in the car, at home, and at work.  It speaks to me as no other music has in a long time - and I listen to a lot of different music.  This album is an instant classic and surely rates as the best album of the year 2006.
B000002GA8|4.0|I've always enjoyed this album, its my progressive rock roots. Tells you a story.  Can be a little hokey with some of the Lyrics the choir sings in the \\"Battle\\", but just sit back and enjoy it for what it is
6304698623|5.0|Some of you may be familiar with \\"The Little Princess\\" starring Shirley Temple.  This is the movie/version the \\"Little Princess\\" that I grew up on (which is based on the Shirley Temple one and made in the early 90s).  Wanting to share it with my nieces I purchased it.  It is just as great as I remember it.  My 8 and 9 year old nieces adored the movie and wanting to watch it over and over. The movie is so precious. One of the reasons it is just SO sweet is because the main character firmly believes that ALL girls are princesses no matter what trials may lay ahead. It is just wonderful.  You won't be disappointed.
B000H5U832|5.0|We bought this movie for our 2 year-old son who chooses to play with cars over anything else. He loved the movie. He watches it over and over again. After seeing the movie, we have bought him many of the cars from the movie and other items like bedding, etc. because now,  he is obsessed with the movie. My daughter likes it, too. They sit in my son's room and watch it every night before bedtime. Highly reccommended.
B00078XGRO|5.0|When I saw that Paramount was taking all the Star Trek films and loading them up with tons of extra features I was excited. I think the many layers that make up any of the Trek films make interisting fodder for enjoyable viewing.  This package didn't dissapoint at all.<br /><br />  Frakes's directors  commentary track is entertaining.  He is a cappable director and you can hear his joy in being in charge of this project.  He knows his subject and his actors and it shows.  If you get an audio from someone like Ridley Scott you find he may know his camera angles and lighing setups but he knows jack about his films text ro subtext.<br /><br />  The extra featurette about Jerry Goldsmith's work on the music for the film was a rich slice of movie history we don't get every day.  He was a unique talent and seeing him work and finding out how his music has been such a huge part of the Trek experiance since it's rebirth was fantastic.  I enjoyed the films score before I viewed this extra and after seeing this it was even more meaningfull.<br /><br />  Bottom line... This was a good film and the only way to make it even better is to do what Paramount did with this two disk set.  It is a must, must, must buy.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is a fantastic DVD for kids from 3 to 93 and beyond. I loved it & you will too.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt's arrangement skills continue to enchant me. If you have enjoyed her previous albums- this one will deliver to you well thought out and beautifully performed fusions of celtic and middle eastern music.
B00000DC10|5.0|this is the sickest hardcore punk album i have ever heard...it's worth all the praise
B00006AL1G|5.0|From the opening sequence to the closing credits, this DVD presents the story of Hip Hop from its roots to present day.  Impressive performances, interesting interviews and chock full of the people who made the music that influcenced almost all popular music of today.  A must-see for any true Hip Hop fan.
0446530573|5.0|The book has a very good variety of items with simple, easy to follow instructions to prepare a good Italian meal.  The articles on Italians, terms, and customs sheds light on a culture that is full of flavor, fun and exposure to the Italian world.  GREAT BOOK!!
B00008XESD|5.0|One of the finest Jazz albums of all time and almost certainly Coltrane's best release.  It's short, but it's almost seamlessly beautiful from start to finish.  If I were to recommend five Jazz albums to anyone, this would certainly be included.
B000I5X81K|3.0|Not his best effort.  I enjoyed his previous album much more.
B000HCO83G|3.0|Excellent special effects, of course.  And yet, where's the excitement? <br />Hollywood writers/ directors need to stop pretending all sci-fi and  <br />fantasy films need to be formated for the intellect of a 10 year old.  <br />Worth seeing, but don't get excited about seeing this Last Stand ... the  <br />writers may have felt inspired but somehow the studio managed to kill that emotion ... maybe it's just too much to inspire kids, lot's of action is better, eh?  For good action, excitement and a thought provoking plot, try the movie Equalibrium ... even the title get's you  <br />thinking. <br />
B000JVT09C|5.0|Superman Returns is a must have if you just recently bought a blu-ray player.  I heard many negative comments about blu-ray as compared to hddvd before I bought my PS3.  I still have not seen an hddvd so I am not going to say anything negative about it, but as far as blu-ray every movie I have seen has blown me away.  Not only is the picture amazing, but the sound on my surround system is also much better.  Like I said this movie looks particularly awesome.  I also recommend Invincible on blu-ray.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I didn't like this album when it came out. Why? I'm not sure. It took me a while to really warm up to it, but now that I have, I think it may be her finest work yet. I never thought I'd like anything as much as her first two albums, but I must now give props to this mature, exciting, biting and gorgeous album.

B000002I6T|5.0|I lived in Eugene, OR (hippie capital of the world) for 4 years and hardly ever got high. Now, after listening to this cd, I've never wanted to more in my entire life. This is the kind of album that just flows right through you, making you want to experience it with every fiber of your body. I've always been somewhat of a fan of CSNY, but I never realized the C could be so great by himself. This is a fantastic album, and I recommend it to anyone who likes music that transcends normal song structure.  What a great album.

B000IU3XTM|5.0|I was thrilled to see 9 Crimes as the first track on this one - had seen/heard it live the previous summer & it gave chills.  Recognized about half of the song from that show actually, so it brought back good memories. I love every single song on this one and it'd be hard for me to pick a favorite. My only complaint is that it's too short, but it could be 10 equally good songs longer and I'd still want more.

B000003FIQ|5.0|Jasha Heifitz (1900-1987) is often considered the greatest violinist of his time.  He may be the greatest who ever lived.  I submit this recording in evidence of the latter.  The Sibelius concerto is one of the most difficult to play violin concertos ever written.  Sibelius was a violinist himself and left this piece as a challenge to all concert violinists to come.  Listen to any violinist's recording of this piece and then listen to Heifitz.  There will always be some part that a performer will struggle over in this piece.  Heifitz actually makes it sound easy to play and at a faster tempo!  You also get Prokofiev's No. 2 and Glazunov's concerto here and Heifitz makes them sound easy too.  He was a wizard with the bow.
B00079018K|4.0|I like this CD - however I do think the second half is lacking slightly.  It's a nice mix of Old Indie - such as Stone Roses - and new, like Oasis; The Verve etc. with some good Rock in there too.  Very good.

0060763280|3.0|I suspect that if I met T. Harv Eker, I would walk away thinking he was a donkey. But, if you can get past his oppressive flavor of \\"If you don't want to be rich it is because your are stupid or a loser\\", then there are actually a lot of good nuggets in here.   <br /> <br />The best part of the book is his focus on inspecting both how rich people think and approach life's everyday problems, and prodding the reader to inspect their own subtle, often subconscious thought processes. Many of us grew up thinking rich people were snobs, greedy, or didn't care about others. Eker clearly and correctly points out that those negative stereotypes all but ensure that we will never in fact allow ourselves to be rich because by being rich we must therefore also become snobby, greedy, and uncaring. <br /> <br />The worst part about this book is the author. I don't doubt he's made a ton of money and he clearly has identified what you should do if your goal is to make a lot of money. However, spiritual pursuit or any \\"higher calling\\" clearly takes a distant second to the pursuit of money in this book, which I think is off the mark a bit. <br /> <br />When this book first came out it was probably the best thing out there. However, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, I think does a better job of teaching many of these lessons without being so judgmental and pompous. Or there are a hundred others. <br /> <br />And no, Harv, I'm not poor. :-)
B000IAZPKM|4.0|The quality in video and sound are amazing in the DVD!!! The features are great as well;  my only complaint is that the venue was a little dark and some of the shots were too sporadic in some moments.  Other than that, Kamelot ROCKED THE HOUSE!!!!!

B000I5X80G|5.0|I can't believe the number of myopic whiners who have reviewed this CD -- the debut from Neil Young's archival releases. <br /> <br />Here are the silly criticisms I've read so far: <br /> <br />* It's too short -- a truncated version of the actual show. <br />Well, maybe. Who knows why it was edited and release this way. Neil's very picky about such things and perhaps he didn't care for the way the rest of the show was recorded. Or maybe we'll see the rest of it in a subsequent release. The bottom line is, what is here on this disc is absolutely wonderful. <br /> <br />* It's too expensive for such a short CD (only six songs). Maybe. I supposed that depends on your income and your level of fandom. I got it as a gift. But either way, this is a silly, irrelevent criticism. <br /> <br />* Miles Davis was a supporting act, as mentioned on the marquee on the CD jacket photo, and he's a better artist, so you should listen to him instead. Yes... this was the point of an actual review; it's in here somewhere. While I think it was absolutely amazing that Miles and Neil shared the same stage together, once again, I'm not sure this is a relevent criticism. This is a Neil Young CD... why would we want to discuss Miles Davis? <br /> <br />* The paper nature of the CD jacket makes it difficult to remove the disc. Again, I'm not making this up -- someone actually criticized the release because of this. The only advice I can offer this reviewer is have the same person who dresses you help you remove the CD. <br /> <br />Now, let's talk about the music. What makes this so great is that it's a live recording of the Danny Whitten-version of Crazy Horse. For me, a 35-yearlong Neil fan, this is a real treat. The interplay between Young and Whitten on those extended jams (\\"Down by the River,\\" \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\") just sends goose bumps up and down my spine. The sound is great, the band is ragged, but tight (wouldn't want them any other way -- this isn't Journey or Boston) and the vocals are raw and bold. <br /> <br />I love the other songs too. Till now, \\"Winterlong\\" was only available on Decade where it had quickly became of of my favorite 'obscure' Neil tunes. Now, here we have a great live version. It's also nice to have a new version of \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown,\\" to compliment the one from Tonight's the Night. (No, it's not the same version -- listen closely to the lyrics!) This CD is simply a great historic document of a wonderful period in American rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br />So let's recap: If you're broke, too cheap, a jazz fan, or just plain uncoordinated, you may want to skip this. But if you're a Neil Young fan, or just like jam music with smokin' guitars ('70s style), then pony up. And then turn it up.
1881273156|3.0|This type of breakdown is good in theory and sounds so simple, but who is actually just one of the five?  I certainly need/use all five of the love languages and have yet to determine just one love language in a partner.  I suppose it is helpful to realize you may be not using one language, but I haven't noticed any difference in my relationships as a result.   It's a fun (sort-of), self-indulgent sort of read and is definitely well-meaning, but like the king-warrior-lover-joker theories, and the essentialist Venus/Mars stuff, it is overly simplistic and fails to decode the complexity of human nature.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|This film takes us back to the final years of the pre-modern world of Grand Prix racing, an era when the old European aristocracy still set the tone, when commercialization was relatively minimal, when nationalistic rivalries were palpable, and when death was commonplace and safety an afterthought.  <br /> <br />This film inserts the actors into the real racing scene in a way that would no longer be possible.  Grand Prix racing has now become serious big business, compared to which the world of the film \\"Grand Prix\\" seems almost amateurish. <br /> <br />\\"Grand Prix\\" tells the story of Pete Aron (James Garner), a veteran American racer who is fired by his Jordan team after causing an accident which nearly kills teammate Scott Stoddard (Brian Bedford).  After a brief stint as a reluctant television commentator, Aron is hired by the upcoming Yamura team of Japan.  At the end of the film, Aron and his rivals - a recovered Stoddard, young Italian Nino Barlini, and aging French star Jean-Pierre Sarti (Yves Montand) - head to Monza for the climactic race in the world championship.   <br /> <br />Interspersed with the racing are a series of romantic entanglements involving Aron and Stoddard's wife (Jessica Walter), Barlini and a mysterious, leggy Frenchwoman, and Sarti and an American fashion journalist (Eva Marie-Saint).  Racing fans might find these elements intrusive, particularly in such scenes as Barlini's boogeying in an embarrassingly lame recreation of a 1960's disco.  But in this film, you take the good with the bad, and if Barlini is a caricature of an excitable, uninhibited Italian, Montand oozes with suave, Old World charm, world-weary and philosophical.  <br /> <br />And, for racing fans, the GOOD elements in this film are precisely those elements which are of a documentary nature, the scenes of real 1960's Grand Prix cars racing on some of the sport's most legendary circuits - Spa, Monza, Monte Carlo - circuits which, in the name of safety and commercialism, have now changed almost beyond recognition.   <br /> <br />Older racing fans such as myself will recognize many of the great racers of that era, sometimes with assumed names, sometimes identified by their real names - we see Graham Hill, Phil Hill, Jochen Rindt, Jo Bonnier, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, Ritchie Ginther, and many others from that era.  Sadly, many were to die behind the wheel within a few years of the filming of \\"Grand Prix.\\"  <br /> <br />This has become a period piece;  it no longer reflects the realities of Grand Prix racing.  But it is a look into the past for those old enough to remember.  I suspect younger viewers will find it somewhat corny, even as 50-somethings are momentarily taken back to their youth.  <br /> <br /> <br />

I read a few reviews stating how Wolfmother was the greatest thing since Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, etc.  I don't see any real similarities between them and WM.  The songs are so-so at best.  Lyrics are silly at times, musicianship is lacking.  Just not a whole lot to get excited about.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Amy Lee has one of the most hauntingly beautiful voices I have ever heard.  I love her and the entire Evanescense group.  I always look for their new music and as soon as a new CD comes out, I grab it up.  At first you are sort of expecting another \\"My Imortal\\" CD but this CD is totally different -- not better, just different.  I don't think I have a favorite between the two, but in a pinch, I would actually grab \\"The Open Door\\".  I would recommend this to anyone -- no matter what your age -- my grandmother even loves this music!!

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|As movies go this one is very enjoyable.The production details<br /><br />were very well done. It is amazing to imagine how much patience went<br /><br />into all the exact reproduction of early Vienna. The acting was<br /><br />totally believable. I love it when I feel I'm a hidden observer<br /><br />watching a secret world unfolding before my eyes. And then the moment<br /><br />occurs when you are in that world; and happy that you are. The Illusionist<br /><br />is just such a movie.<br /><br />Update 11/18/12<br /><br />I like my review. Too bad I didn't like my second viewing. This time I thought the acting was way sentimental like a very colorful romance cartoon; I am amazed I loved this movie and now had a hard time sitting through it. There was one great moment that I loved which again took me totally by surprise. Is it spelled Giametti who is the police character, he was great though I don't dare to watch it a third time.

074356619X|5.0|The Secret on cd is so much more than I expected.  I watched the movie and assumed it was an exact copy just audio.  It is so much more than that. It goes deeper into explaination than the film goes.  It gives me something I can listen to anywhere including my car, on walks, in my bed,etc.  Its broken up into sections so its like you are getting lessons in \\"life 101\\" in reviewable chunks that allow you to concentrate on one area of your life at a time. Its the manuel to life I wish I had as I raised my children, as I went through different relationships, as I try to struggle with abundance issues.  It makes me feel like there is room in the world for my desires to be fullfilled, lived and added too.
0060589469|2.0|Maybe there has been too much hype about this book, or maybe it's just been out too long and it's all common sense to me by now since these ideas are more in the mainstream than they might have been in 1974. I found the book to be rather trite and condescending, with not much to reveal in they way of new ideas or modes of thought. It was also extremely repetitive and Pirsig takes forever to get simple points across to the reader.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is a wonderful film for both children and adults.  My kids, aged 6 1/2 and 3 years old, watch it at least once every 2 weeks and they do not get tired of it.  I think the sound track is excellent--we have that CD as well.  I love the way the main character, Lightning McQueen, who is all about himself and winning the Piston Cup (think NASCAR racing), eventually learns to value others and their relationships with him.  It also gives my kids and myself a little history story about Route 66 and its importance to America.  This DVD is very worth buying!

B0000AXE8I|4.0|We know what the matrix is, altogether, since qe have seen the first episode. We know that machines have taken over the world and have decided to control all human life. Humans are slaves serving machines. Nothing very new. In this second episode we enter the final phase of this machine-controlled world : the eradication of human life, and first of all of Zion, the city that is a concentrated vision of human and urban life. The human race is trying to get organized to resist this final apocalypse, but human beings cannot much without machines and their machines are not that good when compared with the machines of the other realm. Yet some human beings, a small team of them are following a prophecy and have the capacity to navigate mentally but in a pseudophysical state from their back world into Zion and the human world. When they thus navigate between layers of material life they leave their heavy and hard bodies behind and enter new bodies that have tremendous powers. It is these powers they need to defeat meachines. This second episode of the saga is interesting because it enables us to meet with the mathematician who has constructed the whole matrix. First he is human and no explanation will be given about how he can survive in the realm of machines, and how he can expand his life into some timeless eternity. Second he announces that he programed everything, including the prophecy that is then a lie, and that Zion and its destruction is necessary to keep the balance of this matrix and that the final destruction that is announced will be the sixth destruction. We note that there is no explanation about this number six, about why and how Zion can survive every destruction. The most surprising is of course the number six, the number of Solomon that has nothing to do with the end of the world. Yet Zion leads us to the bible and the main prophecy we can think of  is the Book of Revelation. But then the number of this apocalypse is not six but seven. In other words we are not in any kind of a meaningful allusion to the bible. The film is only using these allusions to create an atmosphere of secrecy, of spirituality that helps making the film a lot less pure action. It gives some inspiration to what would otherwise be nothing but brutal movement. Third this film transforms battles, fights and action into some kind of 3-dimensional ballets that can be very pretty at times. These ballets can be set in any place whatsoever : in an open square, in the hall of a Renaissance mansion, or on the roof of a truck on a highway. The general impression is that one or two heroes are fighting against a neverending and constantly reinforced army of cloned individuals than can become hundreds in one instant and multiply to thousands in less than ten seconds. Just the time it takes to open a door and to bring them out. And yet these ballets have some beauty even if it is a little bit repetitive hence slightly long. But what can the meaning of this film be ? We will probably come to the final meaning in the third episode. But here we do have a very negative vision of a mechanized world in which human beings are becoming completely dispossessed of their life and of their future. The human race is also tremendously reduced in vision and even the will to really fight for their survival seems to have been tremendously reduced. The future of the world, when it is menaced with utter destruction, lies in the hands of half a dozen people at the most. That does not make a crowd, does it ? Then there emerges from the film a tremendous sense of fatality. Is there any hope ? If we believe the two or three who say yes, but if we look at the real and hard facts given in the film, no, absolutely no. And this fatalistic vision is emphasized of course by the nearly black and white pictures that eare in a way filmed in all the possible shades of grey.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonneare not in any kind of a meaningful allusion to the bible.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|The third film finally gives the secret. For one, it is probably slightly better as for the fights because they are more in the air and that makes them look like surreal comic strip fights. The technique is superb and the cameras are sublime. There is not one strange and normally never used shooting angle that is not used at a moment or other in the shooting of these fights. For two, the machines are brilliant. Of course we all think of Aliens because some of the fighting equipment looks a lot like what we had in Aliens. But the beings, the machines, the mechanical fighters are absolutely unique and they look both very elegant like some giant sea creatures Octopuses maybe but with so many more legs. Machinecity is also great with the allusion to these machines not being able to live in the sunshine. Follow my eyes and read my lips. H. G. Wells is not very far with his time-traveller. The will to show schools of them flying or floating through the air makes these creatures more computer animated and governed because they get involved in some pretty heavy mass movement. But that's great. The master machine is given some kind of a human face and voice, why not since machines are born slaves and slaves imitate their masters. But this meeting with the master machine finally leads us to the real meaning of this saga. But before getting to that it is important to speak of the characterization of the main characters : they look human, they are very expressive in their faces and gestures. They do have the face and body language they need to make us believe we are in real danger. But of course, the main point of them all is the meaning the way it comes up. The machines not more than the humans want to go on with the war that is supposed to destroy the human race. It becomes very clear that the matrix was planned and produced by some human minds in order to make human life ever better than what it had ever been by giving all the dirty and heavy work to machines all maintained and locked up in Machineville. This idea is typically western in thinking, even though it is implied that humans being what they are doomsday is possible everyday of the week. It is a rewriting of H.G. Wells' Time Machine. Actual working and producing was the task of an underground race living in darkness. The change is that these producers are here machines and nothing but machines. The human race then can have it easy at enjoying life. That's a change from H.G. Wells again because for him daytime humans had become unable to do anything except enjoy living and being hunted by the underground species like wild animals or rather submissive cattle. What went wrong is that a special species of men have taken over the control of both human and machine worlds for their own interest and somewhere pleasure. They have highjacket the computer program that is behind the Matrix. The fight then takes place between Neil, aka Mr Andersen, and Agent Smith. Agent Smith has the power to clone himself into any other human being. So he has become an army and he controls the world and he has decided to get rid of the human race. Against him an Oracle, a black human woman who knows more or less what is going to happen, and Neil who has special powers too and can stop Agent Smith, but no more than stop. So he has to trap him into a common ending, a common death because he has to destroy himself if he wants to destroy the fascist. The rest is for you to discover. Very effective. So the world can survive for an unspecified period of time. Peace has been concluded through this final sacrifice. Here we have some good old Christian allusions. First of all the long cassock looking robes he is wearing, our Neil. Second his sacrifice for the survival of humanity. But there will be no resurrection, no rebirth of the world because his girl friend dies before him. No Mary Madgalene secret. And then there will be no surviving procreating couple to reinvent humanity. Humanity has been saved for a while. No Apocalypse. But a victory in the war against the machine like in Frank Herbert, but the machines are not destroyed, the equilibrium of this mechanized world is not changed, there is no promise of a saviour one day. The Christian allusion is thus reduced to a dire minimum. The meaning is also reduced to a dire minimum : for humanity to go on enjoying life we have to get rid of all machines, productive work and pollution far away from us and we have to have a few courageous and inspired warriors that are ready to sacrifice their lives for humanity to go on living. In other words good old traditional patriotic courage. That does not make this trilogy the piece of imagination that will revolutionize the world, but it is an entertaining film. And if you really get into it try to identify all the allusions to Stephen King's novels. I can tell you there are many.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnele. No Apocalypse.

The actors were so REAL, and I loved the vintage clothing!  It's an inspiring story; I had no idea it was a true story until I watched the movie!
6305212112|5.0|I received this product at a great rate and a perfect christmas gift for my wife.  She really enjoyed it.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|The Memiors of a Geshia soundtrack is an amazing tribute to the story.  The cello and violin accent the story beautifully and really express the emotions of the characters through the music.
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|Benson & Jarreau are terrific together. I can't say I loved every song included but there're some really great sounds here..definitely worth listening to if you love \\"spunky\\" poppin' tunes..enjoy!
0375420525|5.0|Initially bought as gift for my husband and  he loves it!  Told my close friend the premise of the book and she went  that day to buy it.  She raves about it.  She loves it that much that she went and told 2 other friends and they bought the book.  One of the 2 friends actually finished the book in one week.  No lie!!  This book is highly recommended.  Just stay patient!
B0007VZ91C|3.0|Bought this on a friend's recommendation.  It's pretty, but doesn't resonate with my heart as much as some of Jai Uttal and Krishna Das's chanting.  She has a wonderful voice, perhaps what I'd like less of is the sweet background music.  I liken it to listening to Patsy Cline - an incredible voice, with no need for all the orchestration behind her voice.   Would like to hear Deva Premal sing with only the harmonium and/or some tabla. <br /> <br />
6300182282|5.0|Two actors at their best!   And \\"aged\\" beautifully through the movie.  A very adaptation from the play and maintains continuity of the theme well. Leaves one hoping for a different ending every time, though!  A \\"handkerchief\\" movie.  Highly recommended.  Oh yes, and a good theme song well presented by Mr Mathis.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|I have been a die-hard Star Trek fan since preschool.  I was a fan when we were still called trekkies.  I can recite pointless details about warp nacelle design theory till I'm blue in the face, and up until now, I have been a staunch defender of this franchise's various incarnations, good or bad.  But this movie is simply unacceptable.      Stylisticly, it differs tremendously from the tone of the Next Generation series.  And let me just go on record as saying, I am SO tired of seeing the cast brandishing phaser rifles.  I realize the filmmakers wanted to make a film that catered to a broader audience, rather than to merely trekkers, but in so trying, what they actually did was create a movie that is appealing to neither.      I would also like to know why Jonathan Frakes wasn't allowed to direct this movie.  He directed First Contact spectacularly and even managed to make the inferior Insurrection work.  He clearly has an intuition for why people enjoy watching the Next Generation cast and what they expect to see in a Star Trek film.    Last but not least, why were so many good scenes cut out of the final version?    The Next Gen cast deserved a better swan song.
0446528056|3.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, but I don't think his most recent books have been that great. This one was fairly predictable.
1592402038|5.0|I honestly believe that every person who uses the English language should be required to read this book. I know that my punctuation usage is not yet perfect, but I am grateful to have had many questions answered by this book. I suppose that I can be labelled a \\"stickler,\\" but even I have had questions at times and did not know where to look since even style guides each have their own opinions.<br /><br />Lynne Truss has done her research, and she explains punctuation and sentence structure very clearly. This book was a joy to read, not only for its clarity, but also for the author's intelligent, witty sense of humor. This is a book that I will read and re-read, over and over, for the rest of my days.
032147404X|4.0|The style is a little too breezy for me. Instead of telling jokes, etc. the author could have used the space for more information. <br />Also the book was mainly for Nikon and Canon SLR cameras, which should have been reflected in the title page somewhere, so that those of us who do not own them could be advised.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This is my first reveiw ever so i'll start with my favorite band. This is a great collection of the early stuff, but does leave out some of the parts on certain videos. Those who are new to the old school stuff won't relize what is missing, but will still enjoy the entire dvd. I myself have all three versions of this dvd set. Yes i have all the bootleg versions too, <br />but having this on dvd form is great. The bonus concerts are awesome. Ilove them all and have been waiting for years for this to be released. There will be lots more to come this year. Makeup and nonmakeup years! I would recomend this dvd set to all, older and young. Sit back, crank it up and enjoy how this band started and never stopped.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I am shocked. I did not like the first album. Sounded too Dave Matthews. The last album was average. But this album is great. John Mayer finally decided that he can be what he wants to be, and did a blues album for the masses. It is great. Love Believe, Gravity, and Vultures. <br />Great pickup here. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is an all-around great album, the whole thing just keeps the music coming, I really enjoy listening to this album a lot!  It's very, very good!
1581806574|5.0|This book is a great way to learn about what so many already love. I bought this book for my son and he loves using it. It has given him more confidence in his ability to draw and now is venturing away from the book but taking what the book taught with him
1592401791|4.0|I found myself really enjoying this book. It is written almost as if the writer was a fly on the wall, which, I suppose, sometimes he was! He does have a small tendancy of coming across as a bit of a saint himself, but that's to be expected, I think, when you are remembering the past. He was there for some splendid history making music, and his contributions have been duly noted! The Beatles took his position for granted, but they have Emerick and a few others to thank for the great sounds they were able to pull off, in that time! A must read for Beatle fans and sound engineering fans alike!
0930289234|5.0|This is a work of literature that I feel would complement any graduate level psychology, sociology or even international business and/or economic course. The fact that from cover to cover, everything within is important with its own particular ramifications is brilliant and worthy of intense study. While a work of sci-fi fantasy, the interactions, characters and motivations are all quite plausible when viewed from within the story's infrastructure. I don't think this book has enough praise associated with it.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena does it again!  Her latest album, \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" is a lovely mix of pieces, some with vocals, and some instrumentals, from all over the world.  As always, the wide array of instruments accompanying the songs enhances the listening experience.  Her poignant rendition of Scott's \\"The English Ladye and the Knight\\" brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.  I can't wait for her to tour.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|The DVD and cover were both in excellent condition and my husband was <br />very happy with it.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|I saw this DVD in the store and thought it sounded good. It was. I loved the settings and the characters were great. My problem was how quickly the story went. I felt the transition from the fifth son being unknown to even exist to him being all powerful was just too fast. I was like woa. What happened? And in my mind, they didnt sufficiently explain the motivations for the 5th son to be so evil. Was it just because the power was so addictive or was it revenge? And if it is revenge what was the revenge for? His great great great (or however many greats there should be in there) grandmother? I just wasnt clear on all that. Other than that I thought it was very cool movie. Some of the wire work was a bit too obvious but thats to be expected. I loved the settings and the actors. They were all great. The subject of magic and withes and warlocks is a very big favorite of mine so of course I loved it. Someone mentioned it is the male version of The Craft. I think that is selling it a little short. It is a bit better than that. One thing I do agree with that I read in another review was the fact that you have a covenant of 4 but 3 of them really are just sort of extras almost. I was a little disapointed with that. Like I said tho, overall I enjoyed this movie and will probably watch it again sometime.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|A very interesting tool for teachers and environmental actors in the environment movement as myself. in the case of Brasil a version into portuguese would facilitate its dissemination. regards, maria freitas  <br />Brazil
B000L22WTO|5.0|This disc represents an extraordinary series of recordings.  The versions of Arnold Layne with David Bowie and Richard Wright singing are from Gilmour's tour of '06, and as such are first rate.  Gilmour is at his very best, and his backing band is a super-group of talented musicians.  However the highlight of this disc is the solo acoustic version of Dark Globe.  Gilmour recorded this unrehearsed in Germany just days after Syd's death, and it is a beautiful, haunting, gorgeous rendition of one of Barrett's most powerful songs.  The version here is breathtaking, and makes the album as a whole worth every penny of its price.  This is smart, eloquent, gorgeous stuff--not just for the collector, but for anyone who enjoys Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Syd Barrett, and all of the melodic genius that informs their various works.
B000EPFPVU|5.0|Let it be known you must have a superior sound system to fully enjoy the additional 15$ you're putting into this album. Given the tracklisting I'd suggest buying Aenema, Lateralus or Undertow however, Jambi and The Pot sound astonishing. Rosetta Stoned and Right In Two are both intense but its hard to subject yourself to these songs when Aenema offers songs like Jimmy, Forty 6 & 2, Stinkfist...well the entire album. As far as the quality of the disc goes though, go for it. But decide whether you like it first.
0060899190|5.0|I got this book for my older sister for Christmas.  I heard about it and checked it out and I loved it.  The concept is new and fresh, and the secrets that people keep are oddly intriguing.  Some make me laugh, some made me think.  Great book!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|We have known and appreciated the complexity of George Martin's producing for over 40 years.  Now we can appreciate the genius of its simplicity. It's almost as if he had this CD in mind when he originally produced this music. I love it and am looking forward to more.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|A little bit of everything.  More than a greatest hits Cd.  The transisitions between songs are edgy.  This is pure Beatles with a modern spin.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This is a very well put together Vampire vs Werewolf Flick.  I Personally Enjoyed It Tremendously!
B000F48CD8|3.0|Maybe I'm just too big a fan of the peppermint flavored albums to let myself go and like this. Maybe....but I think it's just not focused enough.  It's a record built around one interesting song.  Maybe they had a deadline or something.
B000007XUQ|3.0|I was suckered into this one by other reviewers. I do not think both of these CD's are needed to cover the Christmas musics of the Carpenters. Only the first one was needed, the other CD is very redundant of the other one.
B000H5U832|5.0|Cars dvd is a must have. Great movie for the whole family. Loved it!!!!!
B000ICM5VW|5.0|Great movie in HD. Almost as good as the theater. But I had to go to a freinds house to watch it because it wouldnt play (obviously) on my standard DVD player nor (curiously) my Bluray player hmmmmmmmm.... You should probably mention that in the HD descriptions, My bad ;(
B000HEZF0E|5.0|The Ultimate Missions Collection on HDDVD was great. The audio and video in the three movies were fantastic,Especially MI-3.There were also a ton of special features (some also in high definition) and even a 4th disk (Just for MI-3) I loved this box set!

1594200823|5.0|A very informative, interesting book.  One of the areas the book focuses on is the horrors of feedlot beef.  If you are not already aware of where the cellophane-wrapped beef in your local supermarket comes from, this is a must-read.  You may feel differently next time you reach for a steak at the grocery store. <br /> <br />The sections on corn cultivation and sustainable farming were well-researched, revealing and incredibly interesting.  After learning so much about where your food comes from, you can't help but come away with a different - or at least better informed - idea of what goes into your meal, and further, how and where you want to obtain it. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who cares about the food they put into their body, and the impact their diet has on the local and global environment.
B000002H4C|5.0|You don't have to be a fan of the film to enjoy this fine collection of songs. This soundtrack album features a good mix of very famous and underground music legends. Don't let the title fool you; this music is better described as rock than heavy metal, but it is good rock. Cheap Trick has one of its best songs on this collection (also one of the best songs of the collection): \\"Reach Out\\", which is rarely performed by the band. The catchy and intense \\"I Must Be Dreaming\\" is also by Cheap Trick and its frenetic instrumental opening and closing are addictive enough that you'll catch yourself humming it as you go about your day.<br /><br />Journey's famous arena ballad \\"Open Arms\\" is included here and is required listening for anyone interested in that group. Stevie Nicks has a decent song here with \\"Blue Lamp\\" but is rather overshadowed by Riggs' \\"Radar Rider\\", Grand Funk Railroad's short but sweet \\"Queen Bee\\" and the atmospheric and haunting \\"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\\" by Blue Oyster Cult. The two songs that carry the same title as the album and film are decent songs themselves, but while Sammy Hagar's \\"Heavy Metal\\" tends to get old after a few listens (the 1986 album \\"VOA\\" is a better representation of what Hagar is capable of), Don Felder's \\"Heavy Metal (Takin' A Ride)\\" has far more staying power, mainly due to the well-realized hook and the tight vocal harmonies, particularly during the chorus.<br /><br />For whatever reason, the Devo song \\"Through Being Cool\\" is conspicuously absent from this album (it was prominently featured in the film), which is a shame as it's a very good song, but at least Devo's other offering, a quirky cover of \\"Workin' In The Coal Mine\\" is included.<br /><br />Any fan of 80's music should enjoy this album; the music is a fine example of its time and much of what is presented here was not released on other collections (there are exceptions though, the most obvious being Devo, Hagar and Journey). Knowledge of the film is not at all necessary to enjoy this. However, I do recommend the film to anyone who enjoys adult animation.<br /><br />If you like 80's music or any of the bands listed, this is a perfect addition to your music library.necessary to enjoy this.

B000AY74OG|5.0|A classic not only has many references to real-world happenings, but it has to have a darn good story, too. This animated movie wins in boths cases. It's original. My husband and I watch it over and over again (no kids). When we first saw Madagascar, we rented it with \\"Over the Hedge.\\" While OTH was good, not much can even compare with Madagascar. I'd put it in the running with Shrek. <br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, \\"you got to move it, move it!\\" to buy a copy. It's got so many extras on the DVD, that if you rent it, there's no way you'd have time to see them all.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I love the CD, and the service was excellent.  Very happy, no complaints.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this for my daughter when she was 14 months old.  It's the perfect size for her to hold and she loves the doll's closing eyes.  The doll also has a nice baby scent that others don't have.
B0000844M8|5.0|A story about letting go of something you love because it is the right thing to do.  A classic that should be seen by the entire family.  A lesson in appreicating nature but yet letting nature be free and unkept by man.  A must see!
1400064287|5.0|I have been in church ministry for 8 years and this book has helped me do a better job of crafting lessons and sermons.   <br /> <br />I particularly liked the concept of the \\"Curse of Knowledge\\" - that sometimes our knowldge of a subject makes it harder to teach others because we can't remember what it was like to \\"not know.\\"  As a minister I need to remember to unpack terms like salvation, sin, holiness, repentence, etc that are familiar to me but not others.       <br /> <br />I loved the example of the tapping exercise - pick a song and have someone try to guess what it is through your tapping it onto a tabletop.  The frustration you will feel when they can't guess it is like the frustration a teacher feels when his/her students don't get a lesson.  Since our students can not read our minds, we need to use methods that will help the message \\"stick\\" and this book will help you do that.    <br /> <br />Also, it seems like most people started with Malcolm Gladwell's books and got to this book but I started with Made To Stick and am now reading some of Gladwell's stuff!
B000002L99|5.0|Does it get any better than this?  Eddie Van Halen is one of the best guitarists in the world.  He's a genius on guitar and you got to love those ballads.  It really doesn't get any better than this when you're a TRUE FAN!!!
B00001QEE8|5.0|My Daddy took me to see this movie when I was a small child.  This movie has been a lasting and happy memory of my childhood, so I was thrilled  when my grandson fell in love with it also. I had a VHS version of the movie and when it was destroyed I panicked because Disney had already stopped production of it.  After checking EVERYWHERE I finally located the movie with Amazon.com as my middleman.  I ordered the CD version, which was not cheap, but I got it at the best price through Amazon.<br /><br />My grandson is singing with the movie again and happy.  This movie is timeless and well worth the price paid.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my husband.  We recently saw the \\"Love\\" show in Las Vegas and were blown away.  After reading reviews from other people who had purchased this item, I decided to buy it.  We listen to it all the time and the sound is incredible.
0802130208|5.0|Toole's vivid characters make this book both easy and fun to read. It is a wonderful story, highly entertaining, and advisable for anyone interested in great American fiction or just a good book!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Actually, I bought this for my teenage son. But I have found myself engrossed in this series as well. The acting is superb (with interesting character development)and the backdrop of the war of course lends action and authenticity to the story. Knowing it's a true story makes it particularly impactful. Excellent series which I am sure I will view more than once.

B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt's mellow sounds and melodic voice come together is his deput album, Back to Bedlam. I enjoyed this album very much it the kind of music you can put on, on a Sunday afternoon and just relax. I especially enjoy the tracks, \\"High\\", \\"Wisemen\\", \\"Goodbye my Lover\\", \\"Out of my Mind\\", \\"So Long Jimmy\\", and \\"Billy\\". The only problem that I have with this record is it's too short I wish the songs could have either been longer or there were more songs, 10 tracks wasn't enough.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|There are several songs on this album I love, but there are many songs that sort of sound alike and get a little monotonous.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|well i actually like this CD better than the first. here's my take on the songs: <br /> <br />1. wind it up - well i originally didnt like this song when it came out but it grew on me. its catchy. <br /> <br />2. the sweet escape - one of my fave songs! this is another catchy song to listen to while riding in the car <br /> <br />3. orange county girl - this is where gwen tries to rap. but i think its cute! i love the line \\"music dont come in no color\\". and i think thats why she did this song. its supposed to be fun and something you can sing (or rap?) along to in the car <br /> <br />4. early winter - another one of my fave tracks! her voice sounds amazing on this track. its a little slower and more mellow than the previous tracks <br /> <br />5. now that you got it - i like to listen to this one in the car also and just turn it all the way up and dance on my way to where ever.  i also like to listen to it when i'm getting ready to out <br /> <br />6. 4 in the morning - i like the beat in this song. easy listening <br /> <br />7. yummy - ok. i'm sorry i just dont like this song. its weird. the chorus is retarded and they just talk through out the whole song. its not really dancible, and not car enjoyable either. it's just kind of there. <br /> <br />8. florescent - this one is okay. its got more of that futuristic sound to it. i have to be in the mood to listen to it <br /> <br />9. breakin up - okay i admit the lyrics are dumb (about a dropped phone call!) but i like the beat so i like to turn it up in my car and dance along lol. i guess this song is supposed to mimick a rap song too. <br /> <br />10. dont get it twisted - i thought this song was weird at first too, but some how it works. i think its kind of salsa mixed with...i dunno.  <br /> <br />11. u started it - this is another easy listening song, kind of sounds 80s <br /> <br />12. wonderful life - i like the music on this song and voice sounds very electric. this one sounds kind of techno (the music) withher singing all airy over it <br /> <br />so over all i like the CD! its a little different but still good! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The soundtrack from Wicked is fabulous. It not only helps to tell the engaging story, the songs stay with you--fun, inspiring, and moving.
B000H305U0|5.0|I'm very happy with this CD.  I originally bought it for the My Love song, but found that I like nearly all the songs on the CD.  My least favorite is Damn Girl.  But overall it's a really good CD.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The second season of Veronica Mars is as watchable as the first, with the added benefit of the departure of the rather wooden Teddy Dunn. With characters that are both memorable and likable, no matter how many shades of grey they possess, it is no wonder this is a perennial favourite with the young and young at heart.
0812550757|5.0|A wonderful book, anyone who likes Enders Game will love this book as well. My Favorite Author.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|This old man just gets better and better, wiser and wiser.  The videos, threatening to be tacky, are marvelous.
055358202X|4.0|I won't include any spoilers here, but this book does not disappoint any hopes I had for the story Martin describes in this fantastic world of his.  New characters are introduced in exciting ways, old characters continue to evolve into someone that the reader grows incredibly attached too, and the furthering drama takes us with it every step of the way.  This book is incredible, and so are the ones that came before it.  If you are like me, you have a stack on your \\"To Read\\" list.  But if you have an opening, or are between books, go get these books.  If you like realistic fantasy and adventure, then these books should be with you.

0441009425|1.0|I had a hard time getting through this book, and in the end.... didn't. I finally gave up about 80% of the way through it. I just couldn't take it anymore. The plot was taking far too long to move, and I found that I really didn't care about the characters. I almost never give up on books, especially those with good reviews, but I finally just lost interest. IMO this book is to be avoided.
B00004TJKI|4.0|\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\"(1959) is a riveting courtroom drama that has kept my interest for 160 minutes. Jimmy Stewart was a shining star as a small town lawyer. A former ADA, he took a job as a defender for a jealous army lieutenant (Ben Gazarra - now, he WAS a revelation and an extremely attractive man back in 1959) who pleads innocent in murdering the rapist of his very seductive young wife (Lee Remick). There is no doubt that he did the killing. The question is what strategy and tactics his lawyer will choose for his defense?<br /><br />The other joy of \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is George C. Scott in a role of ADA Claude Dancer. The gripping exchanges between Scott and Stewart literally keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. Both actors received well deserved Oscar nominations as well as Arthur O'Connell who played Stewart's drinking loyal friend, Parnell. The film is masterfully shot by Otto Preminger and features a brilliant music by Duke Ellington. \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is based on a seemingly simple story of a real life 1952 slaying at the Lumberjack Tavern in Big Bay, Michigan. It is packed with excitement, controversy, passion and intrigue where nothing and no one are what they seem.<br /><br />4/5
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was the best Television show I have had the pleasure of running across in about a decade.  It unfortunately lasted only one season, but thank God it was made into a movie (Serenity), so at least I was able to see my much-loved characters again.  This is highly recommended as well as the movie Serenity.  You won't be dissapointed!

B000J10ERO|4.0|There hasn't been a great Superman movie made in my 22 years of living. I'm a huge fan of the man of steel though and this was one of my most antcipated movies of 06. It's Directed by Bryan Singer(X-Men, X-2} who left that franchise to come Superman. All Superman movies are graded upon the first made by Richard Donner and the numerous great tv shows based on the character. Superman Returns jumpstarts the movie franchise and gives us something Superman 3 and 4 lacked being a good movie. <br /> <br />Superman(Brandon Routh) has returned to earth from his five year exodus to the planet Krypton. He found the planet in ruins and returns to earth almost in a mid-life crisis. Earth has gone on without him. Lois Lane(Bosworth) has moved on being engaged and having a five year old son. Lex Luthor(Spacey)has gotten out of jail because Superman missed his courtdate. Once again he is launching a sinister plot to make himself alot of money and kill some people in the process. Superman must rebound and stop Lex and get life back to normal. <br /> <br />I liked Brandon Routh as Superman. I hate the little curl they had him wearing when he was the man of steel and not Clark Kent. He is a Christopher Reeve clone and that has to be how he got the nod over Tom Welling from Smallville. He fits the part great though. He's a physical presence on the screen and like Reeve he just embodies Superman. You look at him and say, \\"Yeah, this is Superman.\\" It's a huge role for a non-known actor to take on. <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey is on the greatest actors of my generation and plays \\"The Worlds Greatest Criminal Mind\\" to perfection. Where Hackman was over the top Spacey is funny. He is intense at times and just a touch sarcastic. I wish he had more screen time, but oh well. <br /> <br />Kate Bosworth is ok as Lois. She stops the movie from being five stars. It's not that she does a bad job, it's the things she can't do. Kate is 23 years old and Lois has to be in her early 30's. She is one of themost established reporters in the world and this movie has a five year old son. She looks to fresh out of college. She has good chemistry with Routh and could have played a younger Lois fine, but just doesn't fit the movie. <br /> <br />The special effects are fantastic. The flying looks very real and is so smooth. It doesn't look computerized like lets say Neo in the Matrix series. He has all his abilities in the movie and uses them and they look the best they ever have. <br /> <br />The specials on the two disc are alright. We have some deleted scenes and we get to hear more from Kevin Spacey. He's such good actor and gives this film some credibility. <br /> <br />If you love Superman you got to pick this one up. It's a fun action movie the whole family can enjoy. Get out there and support the galaxies most powerful hero and like me just look forward to the next sequel.
0060934913|4.0|After seeing Anthony Bourdain as a guest judge on Top Chef, and laughing out loud over his \\"crack house\\" remark, I decided to read this book.  I'm glad I did.  It is funny and tender. Packed full of useful information for diners, an absolute must read for someone wanting to be a chef, and entertaining enough to be read on its own, Kitchen Confidential has a payoff for all.  <br /> <br />Anthony Bourdain has a blustering machismo that is apparent on every page.  The kitchen crews are tough hombres, and the reported language used in the kitchens is shockingly, hilariously crude.  The author doesn't \\"pretty\\" himself up for the book, but honestly tells of his foibles as well as his strengths.  <br /> <br />A big difference exists between the masses who love to eat, and the few who love food.  Anthony Bourdain is a man who loves food.  Whether planning, dreaming, ordering, creating, preparing, serving, or eating, his love of food is paramount.  This is the main theme that comes through in the book, and luckily for us, he's a darn good writer.  Bourdain's \\"Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly\\" is equally horrifying, galling, uproarious, tender, funny, wise, and useful.  Read it and have fun.

0618680004|2.0|Dawkins Delusion    Any evolutionary biologist worth their salt should know that the real motivating force behind human cruelty and brutality is not religion or religious belief. What drives people to exercise inhumanity toward others has more to do with core motivating drives in the human psyche. And yes, these drives have led people to create and employ myths that validate the expression of these base drives.     Unfortunately, we have inherited drives to oppose and dominate others, to exclude outsiders, to destroy competing others, along with plain old territoriality. In a word, the small band mentality of us versus them. These drives have produced much human conflict and suffering. And over history people have been quite adept and creating all sorts of explanatory systems through which to validate the expression of these drives- the ancient systems of tribal mythology, the more organized religions of states, and the ideologies of later history, including even atheism. Rush Dozier's Why We Hate is enlightening here.    Fortunately, we also have a cortex which mediates human consciousness and enables us to counter and overcome the baser drives which often emanate from or are influenced by the limbic system. The cortex mediates the more human impulses and reasoning. And our human consciousness now enables us to value humanity and to respect others as a unique persons, and to respect the freedom of others and to engage people inclusively. Consciousness has enabled humanity to move in an entirely new direction from animal reality. It has enabled us to detach ourselves from the too often destructive outcomes of excessive loyalty to some system of belief. Consciousness inspires empathy and reasoning which have enabled us to understand that placing anything above humanity (ideologies, beliefs, gods, authorities) leads to the neglect and abuse of humanity.    But back to Dawkin's slipperiness- let's demand a bit more honestly in regard to this dogma of natural selection.In traditional Neo-Darwinian theory natural selection is the central dogma and in the orthodox version it is driven solely by blind chance. Now smart people like Dawkins have come to recognize the impossibility of chance assembling or producing anything of ordered value in biology. Hence, they now claim that its not chance but natural selection that produces the ordered usefulness of biological systems. But what slipperiness is this?     Evelyn Kellor in her fascinating little book The Century of the Gene exposes some features of the ideology behind mainstream biological science. There is an elephant in the room of evolutionary biology and it is the evident purposefulness of so much biological development. Now biologists committed to the ideology of meaningless randomness can not admit purpose, hence the slipperiness we see in Dawkins and elsewhere. To quote Kellor: \\"(Francois) Jacob saw the genetic program, written in the alphabet of nucleotides, as the source of the apparent purposiveness of biological development. Referring to the oft quoted characterization of teleology (the doctrine of final causes in nature) as a `mistress' whom biologists `could not do without, but did not care to be seen with in public', he wrote, `the concept of programme has made an honest woman of teleology'\\" (p.81).     Dawkins may try to slip around this evident purposiveness in biological development with the suggestion that its no longer chance but natural selection but he answers none of the really hard questions. You can deny the dogma of chance but how do you then explain the repetitive appeal to a natural selection that has the supposed powers of foresight (selecting or choosing good mutations, while rejecting nonviable ones), planning (holding and building good mutations till they can function in a new system or organism), direction (moving toward the more perfect organisms that Darwin spoke of), and all the other powers that look suspiciously like the very powers assigned traditionally to God/gods. Biologists need this purposiveness and organizing and assembling ability, this design-like power of the mistress, but still refuse to acknowledge her presence. And they never explain exactly where these powers come from or how they actually operate (in any verifiable detail). Its such a silly game. Claiming the scientific and rational high ground while appealing to a materialist god-of-the-gaps that is hardly different in principle than the creationist's god-of-the-gaps. Would it not be more scientific and reasonable to be honest like Kellor and Davies (The Fifth Miracle) and others and admit that you need the evident purpose in biology for anything to work and that it is there all over the place even though you may fear the fact that it points to something greater, something that undermines all this meaningless randomness dogma?     It is just plain dishonest to use purpose and then ignore its presence or to try to subsume it under chance explanations which only lead to the current illogical and irrational explanations of natural selection as an organizing and supervising force which supposedly expresses blind chance. How is this a genuinely scientific argument as is currently claimed? It appears illogical, unreasonable and irrational in the truest sense of these words. And it is plainly and simply cheating. Don't claim to represent science with this ideological slipperiness. Dawkins has cheated before with his algorithm purporting to show the trajectory of evolution. It included an element of front-loaded design that enabled it to move evolution along in the limited time frame for life to develop on Earth. He needs the mistress but refuses to be seen with her in public.    This contradiction in natural selection arises from committed naturalists trying to explain evident purpose or intelligence in terms of undirected natural causes (blind or dumb chance). To use one theorist's words, \\"They try to make a physical cause do the work of an intelligent cause. They try to subsume intelligent causation under physical causation\\". Hence, in order to make a blind and aimless physical cause do the work necessary to organize and develop life, the physical cause must be explained in terms that bespeak intelligent powers. This is how natural selection is commonly described. It is an endeavor to conflate two mutually exclusive forces into one. It simply does not work but dogmatic committment to an ideology leads to such irrationality.     Read also Dr. Lee Spetner's treatment of mutation research in Not By Chance. Kellor's work on the gene similarly raises many issues regarding recent discoveries that appear to undermine the selfish gene type theories. Such as the facts that mutations are weeded out by DNA, that mutations do not add information to the genome but appear to destroy information, that preserving constancy over generations appears to be a main function of DNA, and that genes do not influence the phenotype (the overall organism). And so much more.    Let me add this thought- a basic assumption of extreme materialism is that there is physical reality and nothing else. The materialist's view of natural laws also derives from this same scientifically unwarranted assumption. It follows logically for the materialist to then believe that everything else must be explained in terms of this foundational assumption. Natural laws are then viewed as purely physical phenomena and as purely physical realities they are presented by materialists as the causal origin of everything else in the material realm, including information. They validate a purely physical explanation of life. And yes, in a limited fashion they do offer explanatory power in physical reality. But to assume they are expressions of material reality and nothing else is a huge and unwarranted leap of assumption.    Listen to this comment by Christopher Langan: \\"Distilled to a single sentence, the prevailing scientific view of nature and causality is roughly this- `nature is associated with space, generalizable to a spacetime manifold, permeated by fields under the causal influence of which objects move and interact in space and time according to logico-arithmetical laws of nature'. Despite its simplicity, this is a versatile causal framework with the power to express much of our scientific knowledge. But the questions to which it leads are as obvious as they are unanswered. For example, where do these laws reside? Of what are they composed? How and why did they originate? What are their properties? How do they function and how are they sustained?\\" (From Uncommon Dissent, p.237).    David Chalmers (The Conscious Mind) makes a similar conclusion about natural laws. He argues that we don't really know what they are all about but at some level we have to take them as they are and work from there. This is necessary for science to function in some useful manner. But it is not license to automatically assume that natural laws are indeed purely `natural' and a validation of the materialist viewpoint. \\"After all, we really have no idea about the intrinsic properties of the physical\\" says Chalmers.     Jeff Rockwell in his review here quoted Max Planck and James Jean noting their comments that conscious and intelligent Mind appears to be the matrix of matter. Physical science is heading in the direction of a non-mechanical view of reality. The universe appears to be more of a great thought than a machine. Mind is the creator and governor of matter says Jean. Natural laws could then be simply an expression of what Joseph Campbell called the Universal Mind, greater Consciousness or God. This is a more rational, reasonable and logical conclusion than the claim that they represent meaningless nothingness. In the same vein Chalmers stated that materialism is false (the belief there is physical reality and nothing else) and some form of dualism is the true nature of reality. These scientists are simply confirming what the ancients have long known intuitively and universally.    It would appear from the comments of many of the most respected scientists that the basic facts of physics undermine Dawkin's materialism.      Wendell Krossa  wkrossa@shaw.ca

0142004235|5.0|The book is true to its title as its inner plots follow that of biblical stories of Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve and Jezebel.     Now don't be discouraged. This book is full of shocking moments that will beg you to not stop reading, which is good because the book is very long. Each page will keep you wanting more as you strive to understand the connections between the bible and this book seemingly filled with evil characters whose only intentions are murdering their loved ones.     Watch as the lives of several different families become connected and good and evil switch bodies. Everything that you thought was true in the beginning begins to take a path much more different than you ever though it would.    Who is good and who is evil?  Who will ultimately win?    These questions also help to outline the major struggle in the book over being good or evil. Some are born with evil already buried deep inside them and others must choose for themselves whether they will be evil or choose to be good. The word \\"timshel\\" or \\"thou mayest\\" takes on new meanings and becomes the center of the story as it lets the characters know that they do have a say in their lives. They choose their own destinies and can decide that they will not be evil, even if they feel that everything else in the world is making them so. They have the final decision, not anything else in the world. What are your choices?
B000641ZA4|5.0|This is a great collection of Genesis video's from the post Gabriel era. If you are a fan of the Phil Collins era of Genesis then this will be a walk down memory lane featuring video's from Paper Late through Carpet Crawler 1999. It also includes three videos made after Collins left the band. I really enjoyed seeing these old videos again and reccommend it for any Genesis/Collins fan.

0446528056|4.0|I LOVE N. Sparks' books, and this is another great one.  Although it falls under his general genre, it does break away a little from his normal story line.  Has a lot more \\"reality\\" in it than his other novels, and felt more up-to-date with it's time setting and references to 9/11 and the war in Iraq. <br /> <br />All in, it's a great story on the real meaning of true love, and thing things we're willing to do (and give up) for the people we care about.  Touching, real and a little heartbreaking (but what NS novel isn't), I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially for a nice easy vacation or commute read.

B000I5X81K|5.0|I was already a big Josh Groban fan before purchasing this album. This third CD is not a dissappointment. The selection of songs is good. He has added more variety in terms of the types of music he is singing. The instrumental backdrops for his voice have great texture and enhance the total performance. For fans, this is a definite purchase. For those not familiar, you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a high quality showcase for a beautiful voice singing songs filled with poetry and meaning.

B000002HK4|5.0|Having been a Rush fan since I first heard them in '76, I needed something to fill the void that occurred when Neil took the hiatus that was necessary to face the challenges he faced with personal tragedy. I heard of this band that was as articulate musically, as well as fans themselves. Lo and behold I discovered DT. After hearing Images and Words I was hooked. They had more of an edge, but used those time changes and syncopations that hooked me on Rush. \\"A Change of Seasons\\" is the next step in DT's growth, taking something from their beginning and bringing alive six years later. It is, what appears to me, as taking a piece written with Kevin, and having Derek add his touch. Most bands would be happy to rest on the laurels of such a fine tune as the seven part title track, that utilizes all five intruments, (the voice of James LaBrie is such a unique instrument in itself), and then throw in some filler. Not these guys. They think of what they would want to hear their favorite band do, and include covers that (should) make the original artist smile with pride, as their execution is spot on. If you've never heard this band, and are looking for a Hard Rock Progressive band that borders on Metal, this CD along with Images and Words is a good starting point to hear a truly great band. After that, you'll want more.

Not to mention Bruce Dickinson is one of the greatest vocalist ever.
B00005JOCU|4.0|Dreamgirls is a certainly highly-entertaining, and it's not a entirely a musical, because there is more talking than singing of the dialogues. It's a fast-paced ala biopic of The Supremes. It's a good story about friendship, trust, and faith between the three/four dream girls through the years. I personally like Eddie Murphy the most because his performance is simply sassy and funny, and at the same time there was emotion to the more dramatic moments at his character's downfall. Jamie Foxx is very convincing as a no-good all manipulative manager. I find that while there is plenty of singing photo shoots scenes for Beyonce to work with and she was fabulous in them, I was craving for more dramatic scenes for her character. Considered that she's not a singer turned actress, and it's her first starring role, she did struck gold. However it's Jennifer Hudson the less attractive of the dream girls who had the juiciest and scene-stealing part to work with. As a newcomer, she was best when she gets to sing her emotions out. A very strong moment was when she gets to do that number called I am Telling You I am Not Going. I have a feeling either Murphy or her will get an Oscar nod in the supporting category. Perhaps the costumes will get a nominations too.
B000I0QK74|1.0|I like the CD but am very disappointed because it's basically the same JT CD I bought from Hallmark last Christmas season.  All that was different from this JT CD and last years is the picture on the front of the CD and ONE song.  I expected a few songs to be the same but this was deceitful selling by restyling the CD and selling it as though it were a newly composed CD.  Now I have 2 JT CD's both with the same music. I rated this CD a \\"1\\" due to the sly marketing issues, the CD was already put out by JT/Hallmark, why put it out again? The JT/Hallmark CD (the first one I bought) I rate a 5 and credit the music.

Disney's translations to other languages are THE BEST so is a good teaching to our kids to watch the movie in Spanish one time and the next in English, like that they learns both languages well. But Now Disney doesn't give you the alternative to buy one movie with 3 options of languages on it. You have to buy EVERY version with the language you desire.

And alike for the other musicians.  The audience are 'rocking' with the music during heavier songs, and mezmorized/locked in w/the music during the 'mind pulling' songs.   <br /> <br />I am careful as to the dvd's that I purchase as I am not the wealthy type and I do not watch many over and over and over- but this one is highly worth it.

B0000073I5|4.0|I listened to this album all through my university years, 20 years ago, and so finding it now has brought back a lot of good memories. I'm glad that I was able to get an import version as I have not seen it anywhere for a long time. I love this type of progressive rock music in the vein of Genesis and Yes. Mike Rutherford may be the most unassuming member of Genesis and this album seems to be in keeping with his personality since he doesn't seem to be front and center, although he lays down some nice guitar solos and wrote the material. But the entire ensemble is allowed to shine on this album. It sounds a bit like Genesis but also offers something different.   <br /> <br />I especially like the \\"Smallcreep's Day\\" suite, which is based on a story by Peter Currell Brown. It used to be one side of the album and it's a sort of concept song with one piece flowing into the other. I think it captures the alienation of working at a dead end job and the thrill of trying to escape from it.  <br /> <br />Overall, I like the musicianship on the album, particularly Simon Phillips' drumming, which can be a bit heavy-handed at times, but I think it works. He does some very interesting things on \\"Out Into the Daylight\\" and \\"Moonshine\\". Mike Rutherford has some nice solos on \\"Working In Line\\" and \\"Time and Time Again\\" and uses the acoustic guitar to good effect. Listening to this album again after many years I have much more appreciation for Noel McCalla's vocals. Some of the songs verge on being too \\"poppy\\" as my university roommate would say, so it depends whether you like that or not. <br /> <br />The one drawback with this package is that there are no liner notes. I have the original vinyl album and there were extensive notes, lyrics and some cool artwork. This package doesn't even list the musicians, which is the first thing I look for when buying a solo album from someone who plays in a group like Genesis. So, unfortunately, you have to go to the Internet to get any information on the project.

This one sounded so much like the other one that we had to check to be sure which one was on.  If therer are 18 musicians playing this music, they must have a very strong union because the other 13 or more must have been in another room taking a prolonged break.  We istened to the \\"Music for 18 Musicians\\" again by mistake, and then put it both CDs in a place where we would never do it again.  My wife, two sons who are a freshman and a senior in college, and I enjoy music and have a wide range of tastes in music. None of us could tolerate either of Steve Reich's CDs, must less like it.  Don't buy a Steve Reich CD without listening to it first.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|It's a very interesting package with lots of cool pictures of the band..great music and a great story behind the album.
B000F48CD8|4.0|A GREAT COMBINATION OF CLASSIC ROCK GUITAR, GOOD SINGING, GOOD SONG WRITING AND A SOLID BAND AS A UNIT.   BUT OF COURSE JACK WHITE ADDS THE STAR POWER AND MUSICAINSHIP TO BRING IT BEYOND THE ORDINARY A LA CLAPTON WITH CREAM.  I HOPE THEY DO MORE ALBUMS TOGETHER.  I SAW THEM LIVE WITH DYLAN AND THEY WERE VERY GOOD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My 4-year-old and my 16-year-old both loved it! Especially these scene with the tractor tipping! Has already been watched at least a dozen times and will contiue to be watched often I am sure!
B00011RPB0|5.0|I love to watch anything Sofia Coppola produces. She just has a unique view of love and friendship. I have to admit while watching Lost in Translation initially, I was clueless and totally lost in translation for the first half of the movie. I kept thinking where is this story going. I guess the light bulb finally turned on in the second half of the picture. I had to watch this film again the next night. It was then that everything makes sense and I realized that Lost in Translation is such a special film.
B000H305U0|4.0|i realy loved the cd, i was totally happy with the service that i recieved from amazon they were wonderful.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This is quite a spine-tingling movie that I've watched over and over again.  It's worth your time to check it out.
B000IZJZLM|3.0|I didn't liked this album as much as their previous ones. I thought their first one and their Christmas album were the best.
B000001F5F|3.0|This album was my introduction to U2 many years ago and I've been a U2 fan ever since.  Even though I'm not a big fan of live albums I think this one captures the essence of U2's early years. My only complaint is the short song selection.  For those who have U2's early albums perharps the best treat here is the 2 non-album tracks 11 O'clock Tick Tock and Party Girl.  For those who don't have those early albums this is a nice compilation of the very basics.  In some cases I actually like the live versions better than the studio ones, such as in 40 and particularly Gloria.  I would give this album ***1/2 but that's not possible.
B000HCO840|5.0|I LITERALLY GREW UP ON THE ANIMATED VERSION OF X-MEN I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYBODY WHO GREW ON ON THE ANIMATED VERSION AND KNOW THE COMIC BECAUSE SEE IN ON THE BIG SCREEN WITH BIG TIME STARS IT IS AWESOME
B000G73UEU|5.0|Cannot recommend this CD enough.  Saw the DVD.  Had never heard of Leonard Cohen (which surprised me).  Have been playing the tracks over and over again.  Most interesting music in this day and age of loud, unsatisfying noise.  Give it a try and see if you agree.
B00003CWPL|4.0|hey, you know me, I dont usually go in if for teen \\"coming of age\\" flicks but this one is an exception. Lynch captures the pain of pubescence in a bitter sweet \\"song of thyself-esq\\" pot pourri. The locker room shower scene really moved me, and i dont think im the only one that feels this way, but it struck a little too close to home.  <br /> <br />Kudos Herr Lynch!
B00011RPB0|5.0|I watched this movie with about 10 others, ranging in age from 15 to 50.  Every one of us thought the movie was great.  It was hysterically funny and each one of us would highly recommend it.  I know Richard Roper thought it was a great film although some of his viewers disagreed with him and gave him a bad time for recommending it.  But we all loved it and had a great time watching it.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I have not given this subject its due consideration of late.  This movie has some moments that would probably feel a little forced for a few (some scenes meant to give you personal association with the problem), but I believe it contained compelling and well thought out information.  I truly do believe that people should feel compelled to be aware of what is contained in this video, and feel the need to gather their own evidence to understand this problem more deeply.
0060888695|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is an exceptional story, one of the highest quality and Sissy Spacek was the perfect choice to narrate.  I recommend  this book to young and old alike, but would not recommend it for young children.
B000CRQX34|5.0|Well, Monty Python's Holy Grail is a gem in and of itself, but this edition has quite a bit of added pleasures (as you probably could surmise from the title).  It has an intro that I hadn't seen before - I thought I'd stuck in the wrong video, which I quickly discovered was its intent.  There were added scenes in the movie, which I enjoyed.<br /><br />All around, it's a must for those who adore these guys as much as I do.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Great creative movie of a familiar tale that puts you right into the Christmas spirit!
6305949980|5.0|A bit pricey, but it was new as promised and my nephew is happy.
0689853491|5.0|Reading this book with my two daughters always reminds me of Girl Scout camp. We don't just read it -- we make the sounds and use our hands and feet. They love it, and I enjoy it, too. And the illustrations are wonderful. The book is now one of my favorite gifts for kids ages 2 to 5.
B000GYI32M|4.0|The collection is beautifully packaged and the quality of the dvd's is very good. The 3rd season was a bit of a disappointment as there seems to be more and more \\"unpleasant\\" characters in the series and fewer of the nice and positive ones.  The best part centres on the relationship between Summer and Seth, and Summer in particular proves to be the only shining funny and clever character of the movie. My teen-age daughter is a great fan of the series but I personally think that certain \\"stereotypes\\" should be avoided or at least become more faceted(the poor rich girl who faces great emotional problems and turns to bad companies...Marissa, get a life!).  All in all, the series still retains a great visual impact and the \\"adult\\" characters are still fascinating and very well played.
B000127LW2|1.0|We found out too late that this was a bootlegged copy -- Buyer Beware!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I bought two of these, one for me and one for my mom for Christmas. We have both really enjoyed it. If you are a fan of Sarah's, you will love it! :)
B000J4QWM2|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Storyline, action, filmography, I am continuously amazed at how well this movie was put together.
0684857219|5.0|great book with more than enough information, I bought one for my husband and then my brother was skimming through it so I ended up buying him one also.
0618680004|4.0|A pleasure to read, and there's what seems to be some truly original material, attempting to use Darwinian theory to explain the apparent need for religious belief. I don't know whether those who have faith, even if they read the book, would be convinced; it seems that you have faith only when rationality is insufficient, so a rational argument is somewhat beside the point. But the world has never more required an antidote to religion. (One believer recently wrote to the newspapers here in Sydney to say that, judging by the number of books by non-believers, atheists must be becoming desperate ...) I challenge all those who have adopted a religion and proclaimed that its assertions represent Truth to read Dawkins, Sam Harris et al with an open mind and then explain to an atheist how they can justify their faith.
B000006TRV|5.0|What can you say it's THE WALL.<br /><br /> If you like rock and more importantly like Pink Floyd you must have this in your collection or your missing a lot of enjoyable hours of music!!!

0894803123|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed the Ben & Jerry's book.  It has fun and interesting <br />tid bits of information and the recipes are fabulous!  I was so glad to <br />find the recipe for \\"Chunky Monkey\\"--one of my personal favorites.  I <br />recommend this book to any ice cream making aficionado.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Its a great show. I bought this as a gift, and the recipient was ecstatic. Any Lost fan would enjoy it.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This is a beautiful CD.  Everything Il Divo puts out is wonderful.
B0000214F0|4.0|So much has been said and written about this movie, what do you believe? I say it's a classic, just because the film tried so hard to be big, bold and beautiful. It falls flat on all counts, but not for want of trying. The film features great acting, great costumes and great sets. As well, you get to see how Bob Guccione perceived Rome back in the day. If you want to own this movie, this is the version to have, stay away from everything else. You have to see the film to fully understand and grasp it. It is actually a miracle the film ever saw the light of day, and we should enjoy it for what it is. Besides the big names, the film also features Signe Berger, Valerie Rae Clark, Anneka Di Lorenzo, Jane Hargrave, Henrietta Post, Juliet Morris, Carolyn Patsis, Suzanne Saxon (1956-2006), Melanie Sutherland, Lori Wagner and Bonnie Dee Wilson. The film boasts a great musical score by Paul Clemente. I would also recommend the film 'Messalina! Messalina!' which stars both Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner and also features the sets used in Caligula. The film isn't that good, but it's nice to see Anneka and Lori on screen, and the sets are fantastic!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|First of all I want to say that I was very impressed with this show.  I really had not seen much of this show and fell right in love with it. The show just drawed me right in and I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  I love all the characters in this show.  Neil Patrick does a great job in this show. I love Barney!!! He is so funny.  I look forward to the next season when it comes out on DVD.  I also loved the great price Amazon had on this set.  Great show and great price!  Go buy this one.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Awesome dvd set...great Special Features, and actor commentary...the behind the scenes footage adds to the overall feel of the show...you can tell it was fun to shoot.......
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|What can I say but I love all the Bourne movies and they always keep me at the edge of my seat.  They're smart and action packed without using sex to make it worth watching.  On of the best chases ever!
B000I5X81K|4.0|Josh still amazes with his fantastic voice but I wish that he would record a larger percentage of his songs in English.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and was quite happy w/my purchase from Amazon because I received this item faster than I thought.......However, I am still waiting for a movie that was ordered on Dec. 3, 2006 from a private seller.  I would think twice about ordering from Amazon again.
0393327655|5.0|Harris is a controversial figure as much for what he hasn't espoused as for what he has. Time and again, he is criticized falsely. <br /> <br />The best approach is to read the book yourself, and see what he actually has and has not said. <br /> <br />He is not calling for draconian laws to prohibit free expression of religion. Rather, this is a call to treat religion with the same respect all other claims receive. Claims must be backed up with more than faith. <br /> <br />The book also does yeoman's work in challenging social taboos, and it is only through such brave challenges to taboos that they undergo change. <br /> <br />His critique of religious moderates is also very important. In short, they provide protective cover for dangerous true believers.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Probably my best Christmas CD out of fairly large collection that includes Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Ann Murray, etc. Sara Mclachlan's choice of songs really compliments her incredibly stunning voice.
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|DEADWING es un dvd-audio de colección en todos los aspectos posibles y no puede faltarle a ningún músico que se precie de tal. Porcupine Tree llega a este disco en su mayor estado de madurez, sentido climático y expresión artística. DEADWING combina una historia escrita para una película con una sensacional obra musical que hace mucho más que revivirla. Tensión, depresión, histeria, relajación y todo tipo de connotaciones paisajísticas son escuchadas a lo largo con la sutiliza que Steve Wilson y cia nos tienen acostumbrados. <br />   El dvd contiene 4 bonus tracks que están sin ninguna duda a la altura de esta joya, también contiene lyrics, una pic gallery, comentarios de los integrantes de la banda y videos oficiales. (Sin contar el hermosísimo art-book donde llega el dvd). <br />   En lo que a sonido respecta, poco se puede decir con palabras más que \\"brutal\\" y \\"penetrante\\". Realmente DTS abusó perfectamente de la ingeniería en sonido: por momentos, la instrumentación de DEADWING llega a ser real; una definición nunca antes escuchada. (No por nada DTS salió a publicitar este disco). En fin, es una compra obligada de una obra que probablemente nunca te dejará escapar.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|This was on my grnddaughter's wish list.  It is certainly not my kind of entertainment, but she loves it. <br />Your service, delivery and ease of shopping made my holiday less work and more fun, thanks. <br />Bettie Btodka
1596590688|2.0|I bought this audio cassette hoping to listen to it during my commute.  The reader has a monotone voice and references graphics that you can't see without explaining them.  His voice was too difficult to listen to so I never finished the cassettes.
0743298020|5.0|My book club recently read this book and we all loved it.  There is a lot of dimension to this book.  It definitely promotes in depth conversations.  I would recommend adding it to any \\"to read\\" list!

B000FIMG68|5.0|To me this season was not as good as the first one, but definitely worth owning still! We are halfway into season 3, which I think is incredible. Lots of details in season 2 plus all the extras make it a wonderful set. To be a fan of LOST is to know ALL the episodes, and ALL the clues.
0689878451|4.0|The story of a family headed by two beings of the same sex is very timely, delicately and lovingly told.  <br /> <br />The illustrations are superb.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has gone all out and combined the celtic style with a middle eastern flair. SO GOOD. if you like Loreena McKennitt I would definately get this album. If you're looking for some good music to relax too and you like celtic music then you should get this album. I love to listen to it when i'm reading or studying. LOVE IT
0896760839|5.0|I used this book to design a pattern for a Doublet that I wore to a Mayflower Society function - it was a big hit.  I added my own ideas to it.  One of the members said it was the best they had ever seen. <br /> <br />This book shows pictures of original clothing, then drawings of the patterns of the originals.  Wonderful!
0446528056|5.0|I am a great fan of Sparks's novels and this time as well I haven't been disappointed. This novel portrays in another way the depth of love, true commitment that is tested by life vicissitudes and obstacles and is only strengthened by the flow of time. The characters are sketched with real insight and complexity and their decisions may move you to tears and leave you puzzled, perplexed and really affected by their actions. Not to beat around the bush, it makes great, compelling reading and it's heartbreaking to put the book aside or part for good with the characters when the reading is over.
B00025ETIW|4.0|My Chemical Romance is a band on the rise and this CD is proof.  With their breakout hits \\"I'm O.K. (I Promise)\\" and \\"Helena\\", MCR moved from their indie status to headliners.  Gerard Way's voice has really evolved on this CD.  Still emo, not as much screamo.  The videos for these two hits are also very well done.  You must now purchase \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" and be prepared to be dazzled.  Side note: CD artwork is by lead singer, Gerard Way.
B0009K8L5W|5.0|I think this was her first CD. It came out before she was big in the English community. Me encanta esta CD!

Of all the versions I have seen on film, this is the only one that remains true to the story, the spirit and the characterizations of this work, which is her finest.  If you care about accuracy and fidelity to the original work, you must buy this version, no other will suffice.
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle is a real good pink floyd cd. One of these days is great.Pillar of wind is beautiful outstanding vocal Fearless has good lyrics and sounds from a soccer game Santropaiz is different for floyd  Seamus is a classic areal dog barks to some fine blues only floyd could make Seamus work or even try. Echoes is a classic song also the birds and music blend together to make a floyd masterpiece Gilmours guitar brings an heroic sound to this dark seascape, Meddle is a quality floyd cd.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Most wonderful purchase this holiday season. James has grabbed our hearts once again. Especially love his version of \\"Some children...\\"--an old hymn from my childhood that my husband had never heard--This has become his favorite Christmas song after hearing JT bring it to life.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I love Josh Grobin ,so just about anything he sings I really like it.He does a fanastic song in \\"You Are Loved.\\" That is my favorite then . 'So She Dances\\" is #2.I rate this cd #2 as \\"Closer\\" has to be his best ever, I think between the 2 of these I play them every day and more then once.Do not be afraid to buy this cd, I think you will be sorry if you don't.

B000BJS4TO|5.0|Having seen, and heard, this performed by Yo Yo Ma and John Williams at Tanglewood last summer, we had to have the album. It is an enchanting, entrancing, hypnotic and throughly enjoyable album. I want to keep listening to it over and over.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|A feel-good film, as many reviewers have pointed out, this certainly is. The script captures a very French essence in its absurdness which works very well. Luc, played typically over-the-top by Kevin Kline, steals the film for every man watching as the reformed rogue, but Meg Ryan is extremely lovable too as the reformed conservative and the photography makes good use of Provence and Valbonne Village (where Meg walks around saying 'B-ee-ootiful!').  This is a rom-com that appeals to both sexes, but perhaps for slightly different reasons. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I sat and watched, not much new but certainly all true.  <br />If you feel like crying, watch this movie; how could we have let these things happen? <br />The strength of Mr. Gore is not only to show you all those almost incredible facts in one big and entertaining show, but to deliver all necessary answers you need to know when you meet a skeptic next time. <br />Thank you, Mr. Gore! <br />
B0000AUHPB|5.0|A wonderful British caper, Michael Caine at his best and a funny, if not too short appearance by Benny Hill. A wonderful Quincy Jones music score but the stars of this film are the Minis. Well worth seeing proving the original is always the best.
0486424510|4.0|THE MOONSTONE opens with the theft of a fabulous jewel from an idol in India. From this exotic location the action then goes forward in time many years to the English countryside.  The jewel, the Moonstone, has become a family heirloom soon to be presented to a young woman as a birthday present.  That very evening the Moonstone disappeared leaving behind suspicion and tragedy.  A professional detective is called in but before all is revealed there will be deaths and long hidden secrets brought to light. <br /> <br />The story was originally published in the mid 1800's which can cause a problem for a modern reader.  The style of writing is much more verbose than contemporary readers are accustomed to, the vocabulary is often unfamiliar but perhaps most difficult for the modern reader are the conventions of mid Victorian society.  The class distinctions and the restrictions placed on women, particularly young, unmarried women are completely foreign to the 21st century.   <br /> <br />Despite these challenges THE MOONSTONE is an excellent story on its own merits.  The characters are interesting and believeable.  The plot is well thought out, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing until the very end.  For fans of detective fiction it is interesting to see the various elements of this story and recognize them from their more modern forms. <br /> <br />THE MOONSTONE has been called the first detective novel.  It introduced many of the characteristics familiar to fans of this genre, the outsider, professional detective, the bumbling, incompetant local police, the clueless sidekick, the red herring clues that lead the reader astray and the premise that all clues must be available for the reader to solve the crime.  In that regard THE MOONSTONE has its own unique place in history no matter what the quality of the story itself might be.

B0000012XC|4.0|Took 2 weeks before it shipped and then full 14 days to receive.
B000003CMB|5.0|This Live album has been the standard for all others to be measured by for over 30 years. Every musician is at the top of his game. Duane Allman's guitar playing still reveals new thrills after 3 decades of listening. Dickey Betts does a great job of keeping up. (To tell them apart, Duane's guitar is a little smoother and seems to sing.) This recording still feels fresh and vital. You do not need to be a southern rock or blues fan to enjoy the music. However, do yourself a favor and opt for double The Fillmore Concerts instead. The recording mix is a little more balanced and there are some alternate takes that pack the discs with over 130 minutes of music. If you agree (and you most likely will) that this is the best live album, then the additional music on the additional disc is the second best live labum. With the extended album you will get a deeper appreciation for a band that played until the sun rose. This is not an album to be mixed into an iPod shuffle. Relax, sit down with your favorite beverage and immerse yourself. The music will take you away.
0307346609|4.0|I saw this book, and picked it up on impulse.  The book is assembled as a series of short stories that move the timeline from patient zero to a full scale war against the zombies.  Some of the stories are better then others and almost feel as if they were written by different authors.  A few really jump out at you and make you go Damn that is harsh while others are just sort of ho-hum.  I can give it 4 stars with no problem and think that it makes a great vacation book, or quick summer read,  The short stories just fly by and if you are a fan of such zombie fare as the Romero movies, the re-makes then i am sure you will find this a nice addition to the genre.  enjoy
B000GRTQSE|4.0|Anybody who knows anything about Dylan knows that it's foolish to campare \\"Freewheelin'\\" with \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". Might as well ask which is better, Shakespear or Michaelangelo? Apples and oranges. I started with \\"Slow Train\\" and kept buying Dylan, lookin' for that same sound. I discovered the artist.  <br />This is a good album. It's good Dylan. Buy it.  <br />Much has been made of the infleunces that run through the music. Listen to it first. It is a thing by itself. Then read the volumes of reviews on the net. That's good for a laugh!

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist is a film about a grand magician in olden Vienna.  He is unlike most magic performers due to the fact his tricks involve very little sleight of hand or card tricks.  Although it is not fleshed out completely, there may be something slightly darker about the ability Eisenhem the Illusionist (Edward Norton) posesses.<br /><br />As a young boy, a legend is told how he came across an ancient sorcerer whom taught him one trick, then making him aware magic comes from nowhere but within himself.  Eisenheim falls for an aristocratic young lady (Jessica Biel) whom he is forbidden from seeing due in part to his \\"black magic\\" and her social status.  He breaks no laws, however authority hassels him enough.<br /><br />While attempting to escape with his true love, he is caught once more, then given an ultimatum.  Either he can be arrested, or he can disappear from the life of the woman.<br /><br />Growing up, he turns his act into a moneymaker.  He astounds audiences across the world with magic tricks seemingly impossible.  Even to an investegator (Paul Giamatti) who works for the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell), attempting to detect exactly how Eisenheim performs the tricks.  Some may say it is a form of wizardry, or black magic.  From the legal point of view, Giamatti's character is calling it fraud.<br /><br />As it turns out, Eisenheims lost love is now the Crown Princes found love and fiance.  When this is discovered, Eisenheim will stop at nothing to have her in his arms again.  The Crown Prince is devilishly evil, wanting to selfishly overthrow the Emperor early so he may make his way to the throne.<br /><br />It is Commander Uhl's (Giamatti) duty to prove to the Crown Prince that Eisenheim is in fact a fraud and ruin his good name.  Thereby boosting the ego of the Crown Prince and running Eisenheim out of town.<br /><br />Soon a murder occurs that points to only two suspects, and the rightful murderer must be brought to justice.<br /><br />Some may say this film has a confusing plot.  It is a bit challenging to write a summary about such a film without giving away too much.<br /><br />The movie itself is beautifully acted.  With a cast which includes to Oscar nominees (Giamatti and Norton) not to mention the beauty of Jessica Biel and the cunning of Rufus Sewell, the acting is nothing short of superb.<br /><br />The mystery of the film is found among many layers.  First the entire plot of how the murder takes place, and who the culprit is.  It may be simple on the surface, but onions and mysteries have muliple layers.  Next the tricks performed in the film.  Of course, it's special effects, but the questions still remain how and if they could be done by someone who does a bit more than distract the audience with mirrors and gestures.<br /><br />The cinematography of the film is unique to say the least.  Throughout the movie, it almost feels as if the audience is watching an old silent film.  The corners of the screen are blackend as if we are watching the film through an old tube.<br /><br />Overall I would say the film has class, style and a wonderful plot.  Perhaps it could move a bit faster, pacewise, but it's still a good time to be had.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy!e may say this film has a confusing plot.  It is a bit challenging to write a summary about such a film without giving away too much.   <br /> <br />The movie itself is beautifully acted.  With a cast which includes to Oscar nominees (Giamatti and Norton) not to mention the beauty of Jessica Biel and the cunning of Rufus Sewell, the acting is nothing short of superb. <br /> <br />The mystery of the film is found among many layers.  First the entire plot of how the murder takes place, and who the culprit is.  It may be simple on the surface, but onions and mysteries have muliple layers.  Next the tricks performed in the film.  Of course, it's special effects, but the questions still remain how and if they could be done by someone who does a bit more than distract the audience with mirrors and gestures. <br /> <br />The cinematography of the film is unique to say the least.  Throughout the movie, it almost feels as if the audience is watching an old silent film.  The corners of the screen are blackend as if we are watching the film through an old tube. <br /> <br />Overall I would say the film has class, style and a wonderful plot.  Perhaps it could move a bit faster, pacewise, but it's still a good time to be had. <br /> <br />Watch and enjoy!
B000001FS3|5.0|Personally, it's really difficult to decide if Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby ranks as U2's best album but I'll have to give it to Joshua Tree to the fact that the songs still stand up to today without the bravdo of later albums. Simple, beautiful and down to earth.
0140277447|5.0|This book will educate you on the atrocities committed by the Japanese military machine before World War 2.  If it were a movie, you wouldn't be able to watch it.  The Japanese government (unlike the German one) will not take any responsibility for their actions.  After reading this I have to convince myself that the Japanese men today are not the same as the ones who killed, raped, tortured and maimed all those Chinese people back then.  A must read if you want those who died at Nanking to not die in vain.
087349976X|3.0|If you like books that give you nice step-by-step illustrated instructions that clearly make it easy to follow then this book is not for you. I am an experienced jewelry designer with wirework being my favorite medium. I was terribly disappointed in this book because the instructions are very vague and leave you trying to figure out what you are supposed to do. There is not one real picture to help guide you. There are some drawings but they don't even look like the finished piece. <br />The projects are nice but the instructions should be more detailed. You definately better practice a few times with cheap wire before you attempt it in silver. You're left hanging and forced to visualize what each step is supposed to look like. The layout is nice and the tutorials at the beginning are great. I use a lot of books to inspire me but I also like learning step-by-step so I give this book 3 stars for wishy-washy instructions and 5 stars for great projects.
1593080719|5.0|William Makepeace Thackeray gives a brilliantly witty view of society in the 19th century. Though it's about 300 pages too long, if the reader perseveres, he will be rewarded. The character of Becky Sharpe is one of the best in the history of literature.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I have seen this movie many times, but it's always fresh.  My husband and I laughed out loud and had a great time watching it again.  I really enjoyed the special features the DVD offers on John Wayne's son and on his legacy.  AWESOME FIVE STARS AGAIN!

0618680004|5.0|This book is written by an Oxford University scholar/scientist who writes and lectures heavily.  Intelligently written, the book gets complicated and a bit laborious to read in some sections.  Dr. Dawkins presents his case well, but many will not agree with his theses.
0307237699|5.0|Senator Obama has given his personal experience into politics in a well written fashion in this book. He allows information about the struggles politicans face in their beginning.  <br />In his book, he gives an insight as to the man and politican he is and his dreams of reality to make the USA a much better place for people to live, work and to find the true pursuit of happiness. <br />His honesty is something for readers to actually enjoy. It is a wonderful break from the lies and deceptions now circulating throughout Washington DC's political machines.
B000H5U832|4.0|Very clever in all aspects; animation, lessons learned, voices.  We thoroughly enjoyed all the references to Route 66 having traveled on it and also on the Interstate - a blast from the past.  Great movie for all ages.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|CD was shipped fast and was a great buy! <br /> <br />While Call Me When You're Sober is the best known song on the CD, many of the other songs offered more complex instrumentation such as the violins in Lacrymosa. Overall it was a very pleasing CD which proved a worthy follow up for Fallen and Origin despite the change in band dynamic over the last few years.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Previous Green Day recordings were in the punk genre.  This one has all kinds of different tempos, tones, structures, and great use of dynamics. <br /> <br />They are still pretty political and if you are a supporter of \\"President Gasbag\\" you may not like it but it is truely a great record.  Many theme albums have weak sections, this one doesn't.  Every song stands on it's own and also fits with the others plus these guys can really play and sing. <br /> <br />It won a ton of awards and deserved all of them.  If you are a rock fan and don't have this, BUY IT.  You won't be disappointed.

0385486804|5.0|Jon Krakauer has outdone himself with this one (and that is saying something).  I went through a half-dozen books of this genre last summer and remain haunted by this one.  Christopher McCandless is a tragic figure, but inspirational in many ways.  Was he crazy and reckless, or just idealistic and unprepared?  Krakauer offers no opinion, and the facts will leave you wondering for a long, long time.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Eisenheim is a magician played by Edward Norton who after years of travling the world after leaving home (vienna) in his youth, comes back to re-solidify his place in society.  He also runs back across his old childhood sweatheart, a duchess named Sophie played by jessica beal. However she is set to be engaged to Crown Prince Leopold, future ruler of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  Set in a pseudo-historical setting of Vienna around the WWI times, this plays out evenly with a few twists and turns, but overall a very sound storyline.  It has Romance, suspense, and enough action to keep most guys and gals happy.  Pick this up, rent it, buy it, worth watching several times.

1878424319|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, as soon as I started reading it, I knew how helpful it could be.  This book is easy to read, easy to understand and easy to apply to one's life.  I wish I'd read this book much earlier in my life.  It has helped me tremendously!
B000GY729M|5.0|I had heard some negative reviews about this album, but bought it anyway because I liked the first single and have seen the band perform live several times so I was interested to hear their new stuff. <br /> <br />I love this album, yea it's evocative of arena rock, but it works.  My favorite songs on the album are the title track sam's town and for reasons unknown.  There isn't a single song I didn't like on this album which is a rarity in these times of overproduced rock albums.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals\\" is one of the best historical accounts of a tumultuous period in the U.S. I have ever read, and definitely the best biographical book on Abraham Lincoln I've come across. Lincoln has been such a product of myth that I felt as if I did not really know him as a person until I read Goodwin's work. She clears away the stories and conjecture to reveal a man who was both flawed and flawless, extremely compassionate (he rarely did not commute the term of a condemned soldier to prison time) and passionate (he felt everything so keenly behind his mask of smiles and easy-going laughter that it's a wonder he did not get crushed by his responsibilities as President). But Kearns goes beyond painting a verbal portrait of Lincoln to illustrate how this totally unique individual bypassed conventional political wisdom and brought in a \\"team of rivals\\" to form his Cabinet.  <br /> <br />From amazingly disparate elements, most of whom were former political opponents who either bested him or whom he defeated for the Republican Presidential nomination, Lincoln gathered the only group of men who could have helped him get the U.S. through the Civil War. Until I read this book I had no idea just how close we came to losing the Civil War to the Confederacy. If not for Lincoln's determination to bring the best men in the country to the Presidential table, and his astounding ability to get them to work together despite their personal character flaws (which were legion) we might today be two separate nations on our own soil. <br /> <br />What struck me most about Lincoln in this book was the sheer force of his will. He sought the input of his advisors on issues and when they had the better idea he went with it (if only politicians today were capable of this maturity!) but no one who knew him doubted that at the final moment when a decision was needed Lincoln would be the man to make it.  <br /> <br />Goodwin also presents a stirring account of the twisted road Lincoln followed to the Emancipation Proclamation, how much resistance it faced even from those in the North, and how vital it was that he presented it to the U.S. when he did. His understanding of America was so great that he knew precisely when to do something. More important, he knew when not to do it. <br /> <br />Lincoln was a political genius and an extremely intelligent man. Goodwin illustrates this on every page of \\"Team of Rivals\\", which also happens to be a cracking good read. I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone who wants to know more about a time, a country at war, and the amazing man who held it all together and paid for his ideals with his life. After you read \\"Team of Rivals\\" you will long for a man like Lincoln to come to the forefront of our society as much as I do.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Judy Garland shines in this wonderful story about the lives of a St. Louis family in 1903-04.  The sets and scenery are incredibly accurate in their level of detail.  The songs are classic Americana and show the optimism of the USA in the decades before the two World Wars.  This is a must have film for any lover of MGM musicals or Judy Garland fan.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|This concert DVD is a one of a kind because it doesn't appear that there is ANY more live footage of this era of Rainbow that one could look forward to being released. The performances from the entire band are excellent.  I could do without some of the solos by members but that was concert-going for the times.   Ronnie James Dio has so much energy and power it's wonderful to see him here.  You can see a Dio in the making with a \\"not quite fully realized\\" stage presence.  Ritchie is of course the mastermind and it shows. I just won't be able to say enough here about how high I recommend this for anyone who has enjoyed Rainbow in this incarnation or for anyone that has found they enjoyed anything by Dio or Blackmore after this time period.    One of rock's lesser mentioned giant groups that forged the way for so much more to follow.  And a concert to finally imortalize it.   To a true fan this is gold.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is a must view. Steven Spielberg is a master at creating tension, fear and mood in this period piece done in black and white. It is one of the few films that really help s to educate and inform a public that is rapidly loosing those who experienced the holocaust.  I use it every year in my US History classes.  Many students report that they had no idea that it was as horrible as it was.  It also makes a big impact on the students and I always get positive comments though many find the film disturbing.  I always get parental input and approval for showing this masterpiece.
0743289412|4.0|I have many good things to say about Lisey's Story, and some not so good so things as well. The latest from King contains some of his best writing period. Poetic, lyrical and in places emotionally devestating. The vivid characters came jumping off the page for me in ways thaT he hasn't done in a long while.The picture he paints of Lisey's and Scott's marriage and love for one another is something plpable, you can almost feel it coming off the page like a whiff of perfume. <br /> <br />However there are some negatives that keep it from 5 stars and one thing that boosted it from 3 to 4. The pacing was really off. It really took me a good 200 pages to take off for me and when it did it went at breakneck speed only to slow down towards the end. I really thought the subplot of the crazed fan was thrown in to please his older fans wanting some horror. This easily could stand on its own without that. As some reviews have mentioned the words and phrases that he uses repetitively can be tiresome, but easliy overlooked.  <br /> <br />However what raised it to 4 stars for me was how much I kept thinking about it after I finished it. Certain passages were so damn well written I went back and rerread them again, and even typed part out and hung on my desk at work. Weird, maybe, but it had a profound effect on me in how I look at family, relationships and the creative provess. Highly recommended.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Once again Yanni creates a spectacular concert filled with passion and magic. I have been to two of Yanni's concerts and he never ceases to amaze me. He's a genius in creating one of a kind music. His enchanting music is very up-lifting and inspirational. His band is compromised of talented musicians from around the world giving his music a cosmopolitan flavor. A must DVD for any Yanni fan!

B000ION79Y|1.0|I have to agree with the rest. When I first heard the dubbing, I thought something was wrong with the DVD big time. Still blows me away a dude that produced his own movie would dub his own voice. That's a new one for me and completely screwball. I still like the guy but after watching this movie (yeah I actually watched the whole thing), I'm beginning to wonder why. He used to kick butt, now he's just kicking our butt by taking our money. Seems he has resorted to completely ripping off his fans with this garbage film. This demonstrates to me where we rank in his favorites list. Someone should take him aside and ask him what the hell is he doing. I know the guy is still capable of making a good movie. He needs to be directed by someone why knows how to show his strengths and get rid of his weaknesses. When he moves slow and deliberate (especially is his fight scenes), he looks good and cool. When he moves too fast and shows too much emotion, he just plain sucks. C'mon Steven, you can do better than this!
B00005JKQ6|5.0|This is an awesome movie of an awesome short story by John Cheever. For younger people it may seem dated, but I thought it was fodder for much discussion after watching the film. It would be an excellent choice for a film class and/or an English class to use.

B0000AK7AB|5.0|I have always thought that this film will always be 1,000 times better than anything that Disney could ever put out. It is well acted and directed. If you want to be a great parent, let your kids watch this film rather than \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"The Lion King.\\"
015603283X|5.0|Loved the book, which was the basis for the Roman Polanksi directed movie THE NINTH GATE, starring Johnny Depp.  The movie strips away the literary fun and mystery of members of an elite club (of the title) imitating characters in Dumas' fiction and focuses on the protagonist's hunt for the satanic book, but is an intriguing film nonetheless.  The book is a satisfying, engaging page-turner.  Think Umberto Eco light.
B000089CJI|5.0|This first release by The Postal Service has taken the world by storm.  Fronted by the Death Cab for Cutie's lead singer, Give Up is an icy, fun electronic romp with the same beautiful melodies that Death Cab is known for.  It could be considered a Death Cab album, but it's a fantastic work in, and of, itself.

0060005696|3.0|I was excited to read this book.  It proffered a view that I had never even before considered, and the author's arguments make sense.  However, the author's writing was considerably less exciting than it should have been considering how good the topic was.  It was a little on the dry side, and sometimes repetitive.  I would still recommend it, however, because it is thought provoking.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|As any L.M. afficienato can understand, one must listen carefully to fully appreciate this amazing CD. The first time through, I was seduced by the sheer melodic quality, but held a nagging idea that it sounded too much like many of her other offerings. However, after several times of playing it, I realized the subtle differences. There is a maturity and a distinctive ancient quality to these tunes that give credence to its title. It is an extremely intelligent musical map of places defined by their age and the lives lived within them.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Finally, after long searching, I've found the complete set of Fawlty Towers. The visual quality is good (certainly better than my home-recorded video tapes!) but no 'cleaning' has been done to the image... Nothing matches the pent-up anger of Basil Fawlty cursing the Heavens, or beating his mini with a tree branch. The smarmy, unctuous sycophant has since never been so well portrayed. A real laugh-a-minute series, with tight dialogue and unforgettable characters. Do not pass this collection by!
0446528056|1.0|I have learned while reading Nicholas Sparks to never underestimate his abilities to catch you in the beginning and keep you there until the very end. Dear John is a wonderful love story that makes you realize sometimes life is not always a cup of tea, and opens your heart to the possiblity that love, as strong as it might be, might not last through the changing lifestyles and triumphs of time. Great story, amazing ending. I loved this book, I even bought a copy for my grandmother!!
B0009MAP9A|5.0|Dylan's third album finds him writing songs with a heavily political bent, taking ideas from newspapers and setting them to old and new folk melodies. Though it lacks some of \\"Freewheeling\\"s light-hearted moments, \\"Times\\" comes across as more mature, often more emotionally moving, and darker. The title track became a Dylan anthem and concert staple. \\"Ballad Of Hollis Brown\\" is one of my personal favorites--the folk guitar and brooding story are perfect, with a clever ending. \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" is a bit darker on this disc than on [[ASIN:B00028HODG Nashville Skyline]], but is also folkier. \\"Boots Of Spanish Leather\\" is an excellent and touching love song. \\"Hattie Carrol\\" is one of Dylan's most famous newspaper songs, and stirs feelings of racism and the fallibility of the justice system. The closer is somber and characteristic of the whole album, but I like the whole thing. Dylan's voice is good (better than on [[ASIN:B00026WUA0 Another Side of Bob Dylan]]) and the songs fit well together in the album's scheme. This is Dylan's last protest album, and sees Dylan at the top of his protest period. Recommended if you like acoustic folk, and suggested that you take a few listens to let it really sink in!

B0009MAP90|4.0|The more I learn about Bob Dylan's musical background by reading biographies and his own Chronicles Vol. 1 as well as listening to music that he was influenced by, the more I appreciate his eponymous debut album.  It's an energetic collection of somewhat dark folk and traditional covers (much like many folksingers in the early 60's Greenwich Village scene) along with a couple of his fledgling originals.  All in all it's a great debut--he sings the songs and plays harmonica really energetically, in a somewhat more forced wheezy accent than he usually sang, and the originals are two of the best songs on the album, showing the spark of creativity that he would later fan into a prolific blaze.<br /><br />The album is a collection of folk songs Dylan was singing in clubs and coffeehouses around New York, and it both reflects his sponge-like absorption of influences as well as his proclivity to borrow from his contemporaries.  A few of the songs are copped arrangements of his friend and mentor's, Dave Van Ronk, like \\"Fixin' to Die\\" and \\"House of the Rising Son.\\"  In fact, when Van Ronk heard the album, he exclaimed, \\"Bobby lifted my arrangement!  Dylan got his just desserts, however, when The Animals made a rock hit out of HIS arrangement of \\"Rising Sun.\\"  Other songs are culled from the Anthology of American folk music, (one of the most important folk collections Dylan listened to) like the album closer \\"See That My Grave is Kept Clean.\\"<br /><br />The album's two originals, \\"Talkin' New York\\" and \\"Song To Woody,\\" both pay homage to Woody Guthrie in different ways.  The first is a humorous but very true to life story of Dylan's early days in New York, in which he jokingly mispronounces \\"Greenwich\\" and rolls off casual talking blues in the style of his idol, Guthrie.  The second is less a borrowing of Guthrie's music, but a tribute.  Dylan addresses his observations on the state of the world to Woody, who had a big hand in helping the young singer start to frame his worldview.  It's a touching original and a great prelude to the classic original Dylan tunes to come.<br /><br />Overall, it's a strong but not phenomenal album--as the world would later find out, Dylan's true magic was and is in songwriting, and though his interpretive folk is enjoyable and true to the spirit of the songs, it's nowhere near as transcendent as his greatest work soon to come.  Listen to hear his roots as a folksinger, and to anticipate the magic to come.worldview.

Really enjoyed the other bonus features like the backstage interviews, etc.  Cher is amazing!

B00000I07P|5.0|I decided to purchase this CD since I am a growing fan of classic 80's metal, namely Queensryche among such. Bon Jovi complements my collection and he is a notable artist (I once saw a recent Oprah show with Jon Bon Jovi giving a concert.)  In my opinion \\"Slippery When Wet\\" shows how popular hair metal artists, like Bon Jovi, have now evolved into the modern pop rock picture in accordance with the times. I am sick and tired of songs that receive to many airwaves (Dan Powter's \\"Bad Day\\" comes to mind), and this style of metal is a nice departure from that pop scene.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Being from New Jersey Springsteen was ours. When this album came out, his promoters  got him on the cover of Newsweek and Time Magazine on the same week. Presidents have trouble doing that!  He became the Boss, and soon became an International Star.  To me, he is the Boss from New Jersey, a friend, although I never met him. He not only spoke to the youth at the time, he spoke directly to New Jersey youth \\"Born to Run\\" crashed in at the decade's midpoint. Many of the `60s icons (the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Who, the Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby Stills Nash & Young) were either gone or on cruise control, and punk still hadn't come kicking and screaming to life. What Springsteen offered was not a new sound, but a full-on celebration of an old one. He self-consciously fused Dylan's lyricism with Phil Spector's production values and Roy Orbison's operatic vocals.<br /><br />This was Springsteen's last-ditch effort to make a commercially viable record; its wall of sound production had an enormous budget and had become bogged down in the recording process.<br /><br />Bruce Springsteen spent everything he had -- patience, energy, studio time, the physical endurance of his E Street Band -- to ensure that his third album was a masterpiece. Springsteen's reputation as a perfectionist on record begins here: There are a dozen guitar overdubs on the title track alone. He was also spending money he didn't have. Engineer Jimmy Lovine had to hide the mounting recording bills from the Columbia paymasters. \\"The album became a monster,\\" Springsteen told his biographer, Dave Marsh. \\"It just ate up everyone's life.\\" But in making Born to Run, Springsteen was living out the central drama in the album's tenement-love operas (\\"Backstreets,\\" \\"Jungleland\\") and gun-the-engine rock & roll (\\"Thunder Road,\\" \\"Born to Run\\"): the fight to reconcile big dreams with crushing reality. He found it so hard to get on tape the sound in his head -- the Jersey-bar dynamite of his live gigs, Phil Spector's Wagnerian grandeur, the heartbreaking melodrama of Roy Orbison's hits -- that Springsteen nearly scrapped Born to Run for a straight-up concert album. But his make-or-break attention to detail -- including the iconic cover photo of Springsteen leaning onto saxman Clarence Clemons, a perfect metaphor for Springsteen's brotherly reliance on the E Street Band -- assured the integrity of  Born to Run's success. In his determination to make a great album, Springsteen produced a timeless, inspiring record about the labors and glories of aspiring to greatness.<br /><br />The Song- Born to Run or New Jersey or Bust<br /><br />According to the 30th anniversary addition to this album, (which comes with a live show from London in the early 1975 and a documentary on the making of Born to Run),  the song Born to Run took nearly SIX Months to record. The lyrics  to the song are appropriately epic for his last-ditch, all-or-nothing shot at the stars, yet they remain rooted in the universal desperation of adolescence. We gotta get out while we're young, he writes, 'cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run.  This album was \\"one long endless summer\\" as Springsteen put it.  Each song phrase and each word with the association of the music become alive, for all to see. Even though MTV was 6 or 7 years away, this was the first album, song by song, I heard with my eyes. With the elegance of the music that included a glockenspiel, (what ever the hell that is), just poured out visionary vibes about a do or die situation that all teenagers feel from the heart. Written in the first person, the song is a love letter to a girl named Wendy (Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend I wanna guard your dreams and visions...; I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight/in an everlasting kiss!), whom the protagonist certainly has the passion to love, but may not have the patience. However, Springsteen has noted that it has a much simpler core: getting out ofAsbury Park. This \\"mini epic\\" became an anthem for everyone who grew up in New Jersey!. It is our secret handshake that many tried to replicate, but no one ever came close. Through this song and the others on this album, we were connected like no other group of teenagers in the country. We knew what it meant to be tramps, or the \\"RAT\\", in a world that mocked New Jersey each and every night on late night television. As Springsteen comes of age in 1975, WE do to. High School daze turns into College dreams and this metamorphosis takes place in a world that is about to explode in every direction. From internal life decisions, to the world economy spinning in and out of control, the technological explosion of new toys for the home and office, to Ronald Reagan and so on and so on. The world was changing at a rate that was almost impossible to grasp, but with music and certainly the Boss in the front seat, there was an unwavering constant to settle on and to rely on getting us through each and every day.<br /><br />And I'm all alone, I'm all alone<br /><br />And kid you better get the picture<br /><br />And I'm on my own, I'm on my own<br /><br />And I can't go home<br /><br />The Painful Recording Sessions<br /><br />In recording each song, Springsteen first earned his noted reputation for perfectionism, laying down as many as eleven guitar tracks to get the sound just right. The recording process and alternate ideas for the song's arrangement are described in the Wings For Wheels documentary DVD included in the 2005 reissue Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition package.<br /><br />The Born to Run track was recorded well in advance of the rest of the album, and featured Ernest \\"Boom\\" Carter on the drums and David Sancious on keyboards; they would be replaced by Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan for the rest of the album and in the ongoing E Street Band (which was still uncredited on Springsteen's records at the time). The song was also recorded with only Springsteen and Mike Appel as producers; it would be later, when work on the album bogged down, that Jon Landau was brought in as an additional producer.<br /><br />It turns out Clarence Clemons' extended saxophone solo on \\"Jungleland\\" really wasn't a solo at all, but a meticulously scripted musical passage that required 16 hours to record, note by painstaking note. Even the title track went through numerous incarnations, including one with strings and a backing choir that makes Springsteen cringe as he listens to the playback decades later in the 90-minute documentary DVD, \\"Wings for Wheels: The Making of `Born to Run. \\" But as far as recorded solos go, this is the best solo of any instrument of all time- bar none!<br /><br /> Springsteen calculated every gesture, down to the expansive introductions for the songs, all of which were composed on piano. The E Street Band had to relearn how to play, as Springsteen aimed for a simpler, denser sound, rather than the hyperactive sprawl of his previous albums. Out were Boom Carter and David Sancious and in came Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg. This change took months to solve and the album already had songs in the can. In fact on the Wings For Wheels documentary DVD, Max Weinberg admits that to this day he can not reproduce what Carter had recorded on drums for the song Born to Run. Springsteen ended leaving in what Carter had recorded.<br /><br />After it was done, Springsteen and rock itself would be changed. His lyrics would become even sparser, his stories bleaker, his music more hard-hitting and direct on subsequent albums, such as \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"The River.\\" By the time of \\"Born in the U.S.A.,\\" the Jersey soul stirrer would give way to the muscular celebrity in blue jeans, with an American flag as his backdrop.<br /><br />On \\"Born to Run,\\" Springsteen knew he was losing his innocence, and that knowledge gives the album its enduring power. He was going for broke, calibrating every note for maximum impact. He knew that even asa gateway was opening, another was closing behind. Or, as he warns on \\"Thunder Road\\": \\"The door's open, but the ride ain't free.\\"<br /><br />Fed by release of an early mix of \\"Born to Run\\" to progressive rock radio, anticipation built towards the new album's release. On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, ten-show stand at New York's Bottom Line club; it attracted major media attention, was broadcast live on Philly's WMMR's sister station in New York,  WNEW-FM, and convinced many skeptics that Springsteen was for real. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.) With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen found success: while there were no real hit singles, \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Thunder Road\\", and \\"Jungleland\\" all received massive FM radio airplay and remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations to this day. \\"Born to Run\\" represents a last gasp for a certain kind of songwriting: the Romantic escapism of Orbison and  Buddy Holly and written in the manifestation of Dylan. Punk's sarcasm and skepticism were just around the corner, and the age of irony would soon follow.<br /><br />One thing I hope to portray to you about music back in the day, is it was soooo personal, it could speak to you on so many different levels, as well as to a couple, or a group, but at the time mean absolutely nothing to the person next to you. Born to Run and the songs on it, took what Dylan had started a decade earlier and made Rock n Roll more tangible, more spiritual and made the poetry easier to feel, made your heart beat to the chords and made each line real and come to life. \\"Stranded in a jungle taking all the heat  that is giving\\" is a profound line in that it was the way that I feel when I hear these songs together as they were recorded and not chopped up on mixed tapes or CD's that your father is so famous for. These songs NEED to be heard as the Album was recorded to really get the sense of the magic that was created way back in 1975.<br /><br />The beauty of all the women described in these songs, from Wendy to the ones that found their way down \\"Flamingo Lane\\", are portrayed so wonderfully by the piano's resonance on each song. Just listen to the piano play on this album. The sound is stunning and makes songs like Backstreets and Jungleland so illustrated that you sometimes forget that the jungle that is soooooo clear in your head has only been seen by your memory of these songs and no one else. Visual is the only way to explain what the E street band accomplished on this Album. I can close my eyes and still vividly see the same images and reflections I experienced 30 years ago when I listened for the first time. I do not think I could say that about any other album to this point in my life. The enchantment of the words combined with the music's splendor makes it difficult to see \\"What's flesh and what's fantasy\\".  That line means something different to each person who hears it. Only Great Song writers have that unfathomable touch with Mr. Webster's vocabulary.<br /><br />The Boss was a very important and special friend to me \\"Growing UP\\" in the \\"Backstreets\\" of the \\"Jungleland\\". As friends we had grown through a lot of stuff. Each of us helped the other when able to. From lost loves, cars,\\" Sandy\\" to children, he was always someone I could depend on for help.

B000A59PMO|5.0|<br />I started off with one episode a night.  That was satisfying enough, and I thought the show was good.  Then I figured:  \\"Why not two?\\"  The show was getting more addicting, and the characters more appealing and complex.  When it came to the end, it was a disc (four episodes) a day, and I was completely hooked. <br /> <br />I bought Veronica Mars after hearing it was a lot like Buffy, and that Buffy/Angel creator Joss Whedon was obsessed.  I'd just finished the seventh season of Buffy, so I needed a new fix.  \\"Veronica Mars\\" turned out to be anything but a Buffy rebound.  I love this show--not as MUCH as Buffy, mind you--and it stands completely on its own two feet, even without the praise of Mr. Whedon. <br /> <br />The characters and their relationships are extremely emotionally investing, and the story arc draws you in a little at a time.  Everything unfolds perfectly, each episode solving its own mystery while adding to the arc at the same time.  The climatic final episode is an extreme payoff for all those who stuck with the season from the beginning.   <br /> <br />Witty and heart-warming, Veronica Mars is an A+ show.  And it better not get cancelled. <br /> <br />9/10
B000GGSMB2|4.0|When it first appeared in '83 a generation thought the romanticized, enobled vision of crime depicted in \\"The Godfather\\" saga was the standard for all mob movies. They didn't know how to take DePalma's stripped-down vision. It's interesting to see how a new generation has adopted this movie as a modern myth. The crime-life story of Tony Montana and his drive, rise and downfall is a stark contrast to the struggle to maintain the born-into crime-life of Michael Corleone. In this contrast it seems more viscerally real. DePalma, coming from his background of thriller/horror, was the perfect director to bring this quality to the crime genre. The movie's influence stretched long over the eighties into the nineties, and still continues. You can see it's impression from \\"Miami Vice\\" to \\"New Jack City. It's mythological deification has often been commented on in rap/hip-hop/gangsta' culture. I admire how it captured the \\"have it all\\" attitude of the eighties period (like \\"Risky Business\\",\\"Wall Street\\" and the somewhat earlier \\"Rocky\\" movies) and yet takes that to a fablic, cautionary extreme that's still relevant. Perhaps somewhere in the movie's rise to myth, it also has become romanticized, though in an extreme way, by it's more appreciative generation - and in that, it's made larger than what it is. It's appeal lies in that it is as direct, and as violent as we think crime is, so it's a great example of crime-movie as catharsis. In this way \\"Scarface\\" will rule it's crime-movie turf for some time to come.<br /><br />This DVD edition is my preferred one. While the most recent edition focused on the movie's rap/hip-hop/gangsta' cultural influence, this one focuses on the movie itself. A few things are carried over from the mid-nineties laserdisc release, while some of the other features are brand new. It's a great upgrade from the earliest video editions.

6305388458|5.0|Often overshadowed by \\"Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail\\"  this is the best of all the Python movies.  If you can watch this without laughing out loud, you probably need therapy.  Taking a page from Eric Hoffer's \\"The True Believer,\\" the Pythons show the classic development of a mass movement in society, while offering to help us not take our selves too darned seriously.  Take a vacation from self-righteous indignation for a couple of hours and enjoy some humor deeply rooted in the human need to belong to something greater than ourselves.
B000LC3IDI|5.0|saw 3 is the best horror film of 2006 and the best saw yet.there were at least a few scenes that made me look away.it also has the most horrifying traps of the series.one that's call the rack almost made me leave the theater. so go see saw 3 it's gory,ultraviolent,and one heck of a suspensful ride.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|(3 1/2*'s) Spike Lee takes what could have been an above average TV crimeshow and elevates it into cool and campy art.  With a wisecracking detective, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) who must crack mission impossible, everything is in place for formidable entertainment.  We start with a prisoner, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), who is a bit of a Riddler in terrorist clothing.  (To keep law enforcement distracted, for instance, asks them, \\"Which weighs more:  All the trains passing through Grand Station Terminal or all the trees cut down to make U.S. currency?  Generously, he offers it's a trick question.)  We're not sure what he wants, but he tells us his purpose is to rob a bank \\"because he can\\".  After that, the narrative is replaced by his actions to do just that at Manhattan's Bank and Trust.  He has quite a crew and set up as he and his cohorts enter disguised as painters.  Cleverly they knock out the cameras with infra red lights.  After terrorizing the people, he takes their cell phones, has them disrobe and makes them dress in terrorist garb, like their own.  The police in a daring rescue or capturing them upon release don't know the victims from the villains.  All the bugging is trumped in one way or another.  Just when you think the situation is thick enough, the bank executives come into the fray.  It turns out the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and his close associate, Ms. White (played with steely cool by Jody Foster) have a stake in Dalton's game.  The president has a sensitive secret which Dalton can exploit, so, while the hostage taker may not seem to be playing with a full deck, he is indeed working with a full hand.     Intriguing through much and entertaining throughout, 'Inside Man' often is played like an inside joke, one caper that we can easily follow along.  Denzel Washington has some great, witty lines that are usually associated with James Bond or roles Bruce Willis plays.  Fun.

B000IFSDZQ|3.0|The `RoxBox' was, according to the liner notes, compiled by Per Gessle, Marie Fredriksson, and Kjell Andersson.  After the tracklisting leaked in September 2006 most Roxette fans were outraged and angered.  Per Gessle then issued a statement more or less defending the project, stating that he, as an artist, has the final say in what is and what is not included.  Unfortunately, although I respect Per's statement, this is one major point in which the box falls flat.<br /><br />'Pearls Of Passion' era [1986 - 1987]:<br />Included from this era are the singles \\"Neverending Love\\" (their first single!), \\"Goodbye To You\\", and \\"Soul Deep\\".  The latter track, however, appears in it's 1991 'Joyride' album mix.  It does not fit here, considering it's a remix that came nearly 5 years later and should have a spot with the 'Joyride' section of the box.  The extremely rare 7\\" version, which was used in the music video, would have worked perfectly instead.  Also included from this era is the album highlight, \\"Secrets That She Keeps\\", which I was happy to see included.  The single \\"I Call Your Name\\" is nowhere to be found, and the album is underrepresented here with only 4 era highlights, not nearly enough in comparison to the other albums.  In addition to the missing single I would have included the favorites \\"Surrender\\" and  \\"So Far Away\\".<br /><br />On a more positive note, these tracks sounds AMAZING! -- much better than the 1997 'Pearls Of Passion' remaster.  Of course this is to be expected with the advancements in audio mastering since then.<br /><br />'Look Sharp!' era [1988 - 1990]:<br />Now we get to an era that is better represented with singles such as \\"The Look\\", \\"Dressed For Success [Chris Lord-Alge Mix]\\", \\"Listen To Your Heart [Swedish Single Version]\\", and \\"Dangerous\\".  Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, \\"Dangerous\\" yet again appears in it's album version form.  Too bad since I think the 7\\" version is better with it's a cappella intro.  How many times can we get \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" in it's \\"Swedish Single Version\\"?  Perhaps altering the tracklisting a tad would have worked better, such as digging out an old master of the lovely, extremely rare \\"Orchestral Version\\" or \\"U.S. Remix\\" (which was used in the music video).  We already have the \\"Swedish Single Version\\" in so many other places, including the 20-track accompanying 'Hits!' collection!<br /><br />What about an alternate mix of \\"Dressed For Success\\"?  We already have that wonderful \\"Chris Lord-Alge Mix\\" on a number of releases.  How about taking things a step further and actually including the full \\"U.S. Look Sharp! Mix\\"?<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Sleeping Single\\" makes an appearance here!  This has always been one of my favorite Roxette tracks, and I think that it would have made a good single.  I was really looking forward to hearing this track, considering it sounds flat and dull on the CD issue of 'Look Sharp!'  The mastering differences here are striking with it's full range, depth, and clarity.  The single \\"Chances\\" does not even make an appearance here but is instead replaced by fan-favorite \\"Paint\\".  Personally, I prefer \\"Chances\\" but the remastering punch of \\"Paint\\" sounds wonderful.  The era is nicely rounded out with a demo of album highlight \\"Cry\\" and b-side \\"The Voice\\".  The excellent, catchy \\"Let's Party\\" - a demo from 1988 that was first released on Per's solo 'I Want You To Know' single in 1997 - is notably missing.<br /><br />'Pretty Woman' era [1990]:<br />\\"It Must Have Been Love\\" sneaks in here with the standard \\"Humberto Gatica Mix\\", which is the standard 1990 mix found on nearly every Roxette compilation and heard all over radio 24/7.  Considering the overkill of this mix I would have opted for the appearance of the 1987 \\"Christmas For The Broken-Hearted\\" version.  Or, better yet, I would have moved the song down further and included the melancholy, country-flavored 'Tourism' version in it's original L.A. studio version WITHOUT the audience intro.  Again, try mixing things up a bit!<br /><br />'Joyride' era [1990 - 1992]:<br />'Joyride', the duo's most successful recording period, yeilded a string of hits and album highlights, so much that EMI should have just packaged the damn 'Joyride' album with the box because the album is way overrepresented here!<br /><br />First of all, we seem to be jumping between single and album versions throughout this box.  It probably breaks down to laziness.  How about twisting things around a bit and for once NOT include the \\"Single Version\\" of \\"Joyride\\" on a compilation?  The album version or even the \\"U.S. Remix\\" would have been a nice twist instead of the same old version!  \\"Fading Like A Flower\\", for example, could have been presented in a nice live version or the \\"Humberto Gatica Mix\\".  \\"Spending My Time\\" could have been presented in it's \\"AC Mix\\", for example.  Instead, these tracks seem to be an unnecessary repeat for versions that fans have on numerous other compilations from Roxette, namely the recent remastered 'Pop' and 'Ballad' hits releases.  Must we get them again?<br /><br />Including the remix of \\"Soul Deep\\" (as mentioned above) represents no less than 10 of the album's international 15 tracks!  That's 2/3 of the album!  That isn't to say that the tracks aren't worthy of inclusion, but if people wanted the 'Joyride' album they can just pick it up just about anywhere.  Save all this material for a 'Joyride' remaster instead.  I would have included all 5 singles from the album here, including the video-only release and planned single, \\"(Do You Get) Excited?\\", with maybe 2 album cuts at most - preferably \\"Watercolours In The Rain\\" and \\"Perfect Day\\" - for a maximum total of 8 tracks.  Of course, all of this would have been fine if we had alternate versions of the single releases, including \\"The Big L. [U.S. Mix]\\".  Additionally, I would have included \\"Perfect Day\\" in it's original unmixed album version.  Why must we get the circus noises as featured at the end of the 'Joyride' album mixed in here?  It does not fit and sounds like sloppy EMI work.<br /><br />Fortunately, non-album tracks such as the haunting \\"The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye\\" fit in nicely.  \\"The Sweet Hello\\" is a gem that was good enough for the album but somehow ended up on the b-side of \\"Spending My Time\\".  Too much good material I guess!  \\"Love Spins,\\" a demo from the era that I've never cared much for, makes a rare appearance here.  \\"Seduce Me\\", a 1990 demo that appeared on the 1996 'June Afternoon' single is a favorite and a nice addition.  The remastering throughout this whole section is wonderful!<br /><br />'Tourism' era [1990 - 1993]:<br />First of all, where the hell is \\"Fingertips '93\\"?  Leaving this awesome '93 single out is enough to knock this release down a star alone, especially since it's difficult to find commercially.  I guess Per never really liked this one?  I think it's one of their finest recordings!  It was left off 'Pop Hits' too!<br /><br />Nonetheless, the 'Tourism' era is where things start getting even more shaky.  The inclusion of singles \\"How Do You Do!\\" and \\"Queen Of Rain\\" (originally planned for the ending of the 'Joyride' album) are essential, but the album tracks chosen are questionable.  \\"Come Back (Before You Leave)\\"?  Are you kidding me?  Originally, the demo was the b-side of the 'Joyride' single and somehow found it's way on 'Tourism' as a studio take.  While I don't think it's a bad track it's just not worthy of inclusion here.<br /><br />\\"The Heart Shaped Sea\\" and \\"The Rain\\" are back-to-back favorites on the 'Tourism' album and easily deserve their spot here.  However, going the easy way again EMI did not include the full intro of \\"The Heart Shaped Sea\\" and instead opted to fade the track in after the audience fades from the previous track on the album.  Again, sloppy work!  Go back to the original masters and lift the full track for this release!  I might have included the Per demo of \\"The Rain\\" in order to mix thingsup a bit, but the Marie studio version is beautiful as is.<br /><br />\\"Silver Blue\\" is a standout track, but I'm torn on whether I would have included it here over the emotional, single-worthy \\"So Far Away\\" (recorded live in a hotel room in Buenos Aires).  Similarly, the sad \\"Never Is A Long Time\\" pulled from a Sao Paulo nightclub is included here, but if the band wanted to include a beautiful acoustic cut I would have opted for \\"So Far Away\\".  The track originally appeared in it's studio version on 'Pearls Of Passion' but it's breathtaking acoustic version from the 'Tourism' era is sorely missed here!  The track, without a doubt, should have at least replaced \\"Come Back (Before You Leave)\\"!<br /><br />'Super Mario Bros.' era [1993]:<br />Ah yes, \\"Almost Unreal\\" makes yet another appearance on a Roxette compilation, including the '06 hits release as well!  How about throwing that Per Gessle demo on here instead?  Why do I want the album version YET AGAIN?  Additionally, stemming back to the 'Tourism' era with this one I would have included the excellent \\"2 Cinnamon Street' cut here.  It appears on the 'Super Mario Bros.' soundtrack and UK 1993 reissue CD single of 'It Must Have Been Love'.  It would have worked perfectly here since it's not readily available on any Roxette album.  Only the Per vocal version \\"Cinnamon Street\\" is easily available on 'Tourism'.<br /><br />'Crash! Boom! Bang!' era [1993 - 1995]:<br />Try to hang on!  The rocker \\"Sleeping In My Car\\" is perhaps one of the finest Roxette recordings, in my opinion.  Instead of including the \\"Single Edit\\" again, how about throwing the \\"Album Version\\" back in here?  Nope.  Not here.  Actually, as much as I love the album version I would have probably placed the \\"Stockholm Demo\\" version here for variety purposes again.  Once again we get the \\"Single Edit\\" of \\"Crash! Boom! Bang!\\".  I would have put either the \\"Album Version\\" or the live Johannesburg version from the 'Crash! Boom! Live!' VHS release, remastered of course.  Now we come to Per and his personal favourite, \\"Vulnerable.\\"  I love this Per, but I would have included your demo instead, since the track is already overused in it's edited version on a number of your compilations.  Then of course we get the stunning \\"Run To You\\", which appeared on the previous 'Pop Hits' release.  I'm fine with the album version here, since it's not exactly overused, but I probably would have even included Per's harder-rocking demo since we already get \\"Run\\" on the hits compilations.<br /><br />So where is \\"Fireworks\\", Per?  That's right!  You don't like it.  It's quite obvious seeing that it's been missing from all previous Roxette compilations.  It amazes me because it was after all the 3rd single release from 'Crash! Boom! Bang!' and had a video.  While I personally would have released \\"Run To You\\" as the 3rd single instead, \\"Fireworks\\" was still a decent-sized hit and deserves it's place here, preferably in it's full version over the \\"Single Edit\\".  But as Per has said, it's up to him and Marie in deciding what they choose to release, not the fans.<br /><br />Now we get to the album tracks:  \\"The First Girl On The Moon\\" and \\"I'm Sorry\\".  The latter cut is one of their finest tracks, in my opinion, and would have made an excellent single.  From my understanding, \\"I'm Sorry\\" was a big radio hit in South America during this era.  Personally, I would have switched \\"The First Girl On The Moon\\" with the catchy, acoustic \\"Place Your Love\\" and tagged on the live highlight \\"Love Is All (Shine Your Light On Me)\\" from Johannesburg, in which Marie is in fine vocal form.<br /><br />The Marie-penned \\"See Me\\", a 1993 'Crash!' outtake which first made it's commercial appearance on the 1999 single 'Salvation', makes an essential appearance here with it's haunting keyboards and soft vocals -- a box highlight!  But where's \\"Crazy About You\\"?  It's another rarity that was originally featured on the 'The Look '95' UK single release and later on the 1999 'Salvation' single as an alternate 'C.B.B. version'.<br /><br />'Don't Bore Us - Get To The Chorus [Greatest Hits]' era [1995 - 1996]:<br />The 1995 hits package included, at the time, 14 greatest hits in addition to 4 new tracks:  \\"June Afternoon\\", \\"You Don't Understand Me\\", \\"She Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\", and \\"I Don't Want To Get Hurt\\".  All of these 4 tracks are included here and for good reason.  \\"You Don't Understand Me\\" was the first single from the release and became a European hit.  Strangely, the ballad is missing from the latest hits release.  Nonetheless, it is available on 'Ballad Hits'.  I would have actually placed the beautiful, improved, at least in my opinion, \\"Abbey Road Acoustic Version\\" from the sessions recorded in November 1995.  Again, the album version is readily available, so let's include something alternate!  \\"June Afternoon\\" already got a spot on 'Pop Hits' and I, therefore, would have included the excellent 1994 July demo.  \\"She Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\", which was absent from 'Pop Hits', finally gets a spot here!  \\"I Don't Want To Get Hurt\\" became an airplay hit in Brazil but not an official single release.<br /><br />We're up to a few rare non-album cuts now.  First, we have \\"Always Breaking My Heart\\", which, from my understanding, is actually a Per Gessle 1995 solo demo since it appeared on his solo 'Do You Wanna Be My Baby?' CD single.  Belinda Carlisle had a UK Top Ten hit with \\"Always\\" in 1996.  \\"Help!\\", pulled from the November 15, 1995 Abbey Road Acoustic Sessions, is worthy enough to add this box to your collection.  It is, without a doubt, one of my favorite Roxette covers and tunes in general.  Roxette take the original Beatles' mid-tempo ballad and turn it into a melancholy, guitar-laced gem.  Marie's voice is angelic and fragile, yet flawless.  A low-quality BBC radio rip had been swirling the Web for years, but here, for the very first time, is the full quality release!  FINALLY!<br /><br />Back to Per's solo demos.  If Per wanted to include demos released for his 1997 'The World According To' project we could have had a field day with this box set.  Per recorded a number of high quality demos in the mid-nineties, including not only \\"Always Breaking My Heart\\" but also gems such as \\"I Wanna Be With You ('94 demo)\\", \\"Blue Umbrella ('93 demo)\\", \\"Jupiter Calling ('95 demo)\\", and \\"Stay (At Home, At Work, At Play) ('95 demo)\\" -- all of which are missing.  The latter track is one of my favorite Gessle recordings ever.  It appeared on a limited release CD EP packaged with the 2002 'The Look For Roxette' book.<br /><br />Per's beautiful \\"Love Doesn't Live Here\\" can be heard being rehearsed on piano in the 1995 Roxette documentary and a studio cut was eventually placed on the b-side of his 1997 'Kix' single.  However, this favorite is unfortunately missing here.  I suppose he had to draw the line somewhere in terms of Roxette vs. Per Gessle solo material.  Still, these are all strong demo and studio recordings that are, in my opinion, often better than the overused material that is presented here.<br /><br />\\"The Look '95\\", a UK-only single release featuring various 1995 remixes of the 1989 smash, is missing from this set as well.  Understandably, since it is a remix, leaving it off the release can be understood.  However, I'm sure many fans would have loved to have had this version released on this box since the single is out of print and rare.<br /><br />'Have A Nice Day' era [1997 - 1999]:<br /><br />In 1997 Roxette teamed up to record a unique version of Sheryl Crow's 1996 self-titled album cut, \\"Oh Marie,\\" for their manager Marie Dimberg.  It was included on a limited Swedish release (101 copies!) of the album, 'Absolut Marie Dimberg.'  Now how rare is this?  Where is it on the box?  Nowhere!  This is similar to the 1991 unique 2:21 recording of \\"The Look\\" for Swedish boss Ralph Nygren that is nowhere to be found either.<br /><br />\\"Wish I Could Fly\\" starts off the era.  We have thisrecording on the 2000 U.S. 'Don't Bore Us' issue, 2002 release of 'The Ballad Hits', and the 2006 collection 'A Collection Of Roxette Hits - Their 20 Greatest Songs'.  Who knows what remains in the vaults for this recording in terms of alternate takes.  Maybe not much except for the '97 demo and the remixes that were issued on CD single formats.  I've always imagined this song sounding amazing with just the string section, hence an orchestral version like the ending of \\"Listen To Your Heart (Orchestral Version)\\".  This is just a personal wish, so including the album version (or perhaps a live cut?) works fine here since I'm not that fond of the demo.<br /><br />Personal favorite \\"Anyone\\" makes an appearance here in both it's album version and unreleased \\"Anyone/I Love How You Love Me\\" demo.  I know that Roxette have performed \\"Anyone\\" both playback and live, so including such a version would have been nice, especially the playback version which included a cold ending and not just a fade out.  Perhaps I'm digging too much here, but the demo featuring a medley with the Paris Sisters' 1961 smash is wonderful even if you don't like Per's raspy voice.<br /><br />Like the 'Joyride' era, 'Have A Nice Day' is represented a bit too much here.  While the album is my favorite, even I have limits when it comes to making a solid 'RoxBox'!  The singles \\"Wish I Could Fly\\", \\"Anyone\\", \\"Stars\\", and \\"Salvation\\" all fit here.  However, I would have included \\"Pay The Price\\", which was actually a double A-side single with \\"Anyone\\" in Japan.<br /><br />Notably missing from this 4-CD collection is the absolute fan-favorite, \\"Crush On You\\".  Many fans will claim that this album opener is one of the best things that Roxette have done.  \\"Crush\\" was originally planned as a single from the project, eventually getting pushed to 5th single status, following \\"Salvation\\".  Unfortunately, it never happened, although remixes were officially commissioned by Almighty for EMI.  These remixes remain in the EMI vaults, so now was the chance to include them in one form or another!  We don't even get this killer track in it's original album version!!!  Refusing to include this track, or any of it's remixes, prompted outrage from the fans.  Per said that he didn't want to include any 7-minute remixes on this release.  Who said they had to be 7 minutes?  I'm sure that a shorter \\"Almighty Radio Mix\\" was commissioned for radio airplay.  Actually, placing the mixes on the \\"One Wish\\" single would have worked if Per didn't want remixes on the box.  In the vaults they shall remain!<br /><br />I think many fans will agree with me that \\"Stars\\" should have been present in it's unreleased rock demo version - or perhaps in it's rare live ballad version.  Again, this prompted anger from the fans.  I get the feeling that Per loves \\"You Can't Put Your Hands Around What's Already Gone\\" and that's why it's even here.  Personally, it's my least favorite from the album and I would have left it off.  As much as I adore \\"Waiting For The Rain\\", it would have been axed as well in favor of other versions or tracks, since the whole album is presented too much here already.<br /><br />Now here's what I would have included:  The initial tracklisting of the 2001 'Real Sugar' maxi-single listed \\"I Was So Lucky [The Golden Blow]\\" as a b-side.  Where is this?  I was really looking forward to it!  That track was later replaced with the personal favorite, \\"It Will Take A Long Long Time [Modern Rock Version]\\", which is present here - yes, in that excellent alternative version!<br /><br />Thankfully, too, we get the demos of '7Twenty7' and \\"Staring At The Ground\\", for which the demo was previously unreleased.  \\"Salvation\\" is among my top ten favorite Roxette recordings.  \\"Cooper\\" is present in it's original album version.  Why not include the more haunting \\"Cooper (Closer To God)\\" version featured on the international single of 'Anyone'?  Again, this would have only made the box better.  Who wants albumversions when we already have them readily available?  These singles, for the most part, are out of print and hard to find.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Beautiful Things\\", arguably Roxette's finest recording.  While the bootleg Marie demo would have been a treat for those fans who haven't heard it, the album version probably works best here.  It is absolutely flawless.  \\"It Hurts\\", which follows this stunning piece of work, is quite a masterpiece itself.  \\"Happy Together\\", b-side of \\"Wish I Could Fly,\\" gets a well-deserved addition as well.  \\"Myth\\", a track that has been talked about by fans for years, finally makes an appearance here in the form of a demo.  I'm not sure why it's here in this section of the box since it was actually recorded in 1995.  \\"Myth\\" is actually one of the few rarities present here, believe it or not, unless you haven't heard any bootlegs in the past few years.  Which brings us to \\"New World,\\" a Marie-penned recording.  I love this.  It's one of those feel-good songs that make this box worthy of owning.<br /><br />\\"Better Off On Her Own\\" originally appeared as a b-side of the 'Stars' single.  Wow.  What a track!  I adore this.  It was recorded in March 1999, shortly after the release of the 'Have A Nice Day' album.  Per gave us a little something extra here, fortunately, and included the unreleased demo version!  The only difference between the original version featured on the 'Stars' single (and later on 'The Pop Hits' bonus EP) is that Marie's vocals are missing on the demo.  While I prefer hearing Marie back up Per, this demo is a treat!<br /><br />'Room Service' era [2000 - 2001]:<br />\\"I get bye-bye-baby-baby-bye-baby-baby-bye-bye\\" - Can it get any catchier than this?  \\"Real Sugar\\" opens the 'Room Service' era on this box.  The track was my favorite song of 2001.  I have since cooled on the track, but hearing it now brings back many memories, and now I love it all over again.  I might have included the \\"Shooting Star Treatment\\" for a little variety, but the album version here is just fine.  As for \\"The Centre Of The Heart\\", where is that demo that Per has often mentioned?  Ah yes, it made a quick appearance on the official site for streaming back in late November 2006.  \\"Heart\\", which was originally recorded during the 'Have A Nice Day' sessions, was eventually sped-up and remixed for the first single release from 'Room Service', becaming the duo's first Swedish #1 since \\"Sleeping In My Car\\"!<br /><br />\\"Milk And Toast And Honey\\" is present here in it's original album version.  As much as I love this mix, the single-only release \\"Shooting Star Treatment\\" is stunning with it's thumping beats and string arrangement.  It features some alternate vocals from Marie, namely the shining outro.  Shooting Star produced a number of tracks with Roxette for the 'Room Service' album, so including his own remixes over the album versions would have worked, in my opinion.<br /><br />Only three singles were lifted from the 'Room Service' album, so a few album tracks were thrown in for good measure.  Unfortunately, not the right ones!  As much as I love \\"Little Girl\\" and \\"Jefferson\\", \\"Looking For Jane\\" and \\"My World, My Love, My Life\\" are two of the best cuts from that album!  I've always thought they were potential singles with \\"Life\\" being a classic Roxette ballad and \\"Jane\\" being one of Per's finest lyrics.<br /><br />Fortunately, era highlights \\"The Weight Of The World\\" and \\"Every Day\\", formerly released on 'The Ballad Hits' bonus EP, make another appearance here.  In my opinion, they were strong enough to make the album, and even better than a few of the tracks that did, but Roxette decided in the end that they didn't fit the style of the album.  \\"Every Day\\", like \\"See Me\\", is another track with the music penned by Marie.  This is again one of the highlights of the box and reason enough to purchase.<br /><br />\\"Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla (You Broke My Heart)\\" makes an unreleased appearance here in the form of a demo version.  The song is solid but not one of my favorites.<br /><br />'The Ballad Hits' era [2002]:<br />\\"A Thing About You\\" was one of two new recordings for this 2002 release - the other being the album closer, \\"Breathe\\".  \\"Thing\\" was the only single pulled from this release, despite my personal opinion that \\"Breathe\\", a personal favourite, should have been a single.  No arguments here for including both of these beautiful tracks.<br /><br />'The Pop Hits' [2003]:<br />Pure pop-rock at it's best opens with the first and only single from the project -- that pop rocker being \\"Opportunity Nox\\".  This song rocks!  I could pick apart the silly lyrics, but it really stands the test of time for me, more so than \\"Thing About You\\".  \\"Little Miss Sorrow\\", a solid recording with perhaps Per's best bridge section, is pulled from the 'Have A Nice Day' vaults and is already present above in the 'HAND' era.<br /><br />'RoxBox' and 'A Collection Of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest Songs!' era [2006 - 2007]:<br />\\"All I Ever Wanted\\" was a Marie demo recorded back in the late nineties.  Strings were added to the song in 2004, probably for possible use for her solo English 'The Change' project?  It's a solid track but not one of my favorites.  I would have prefered a few of her other demos, such as \\"Remember\\" or \\"Do You Wanna Go With Me\\" to this.<br /><br />\\"One Wish\\" and \\"Reveal\\" are both exclusive 2006 new recordings for both the 'RoxBox' and 'Hits!' packages.  Both tracks were growers for me, but \\"One Wish\\", the first new single in over 3 years, is already a favorite.  It's a mix of both old and new Roxette.  \\"Reveal\\" is a softer, gentle ballad with dominating vocals by Marie.<br /><br />The problem with this 'RoxBox' is not the music.  If I were rating the release on music alone the box would easily earn a 5-star rating.  It all comes down to the mediocre tracklisting.  It had the opportunity to be so much better, and I think many fans will agree with me.  As a whole, it's not a bad package.  In fact, it's fun listening to these discs from start to finish, chronologically for the most part, and hear how Roxette have progressed musically over the years.  That's where the joy comes from this release.<br /><br />Yet, is it wrong for me to expect more for their 20th anniversary?  Let's face it.  The main people who will be buying this release will be the hardcore fans.  The casual listener will only be interested in their various hits compilations.  So why wasn't this release made for the hardcore fan?  It's supposed to have been made for the fan \\"who thought they had everything.\\"  Well, come to find out, we realized that we pretty much did have everything!  The few rarities and exclusives presented here are worth the price of admission for this box alone.  But leaving out singles -- \\"Chances\\", \\"Fingertips '93\\" and \\"Fireworks\\" -- in addition to rare b-sides -- \\"Entering Your Heart [Extended Version]\\", as only one example -- result in this box set losing some points.  The front cover of the box states that it \\"includes all the hit singles\\", which is simply not the case.<br /><br />Sound quality-wise, the CDs are all wonderfully remastered by Thomas Eberger @ Cutting Room.  The DVD, on the other hand, is a different story.  Why does EMI think it has to compress the hell out of Roxette with this format?  It all started back in 2001 with Roxette's first DVD release, `All Videos Ever Made & More'.  Too much material was squeezed on one DVD.  The videos suffered with poor sound quality for the earlier videos and grainy, pixilated picture.  While age is a factor in video quality it's obvious that no care was given to properly restore these earlier promos.  Does the original master of \\"Listen To Your Heart\\", for example, really look that blurred?  I doubt it.  Does \\"Soul Deep\\" really look that grainy?  Maybe.  But how about re-syncing the video with a digitally remastered audio track?  Instead, EMI went the cheap way again and decided to not only use poor transfers (VHS perhaps?) but also compressed them to make them look worse yet.<br /><br />2003 rolled around and fans thought maybe EMI would get it right this time with the `Ballad & Pop Hits' DVD release.  Again, it was the same thing.  Same compression.  Same quality.  Third time's a charm, right?  Well, not when it comes to Roxette.  Once again, EMI/Roxette decided to give the fans ANOTHER dose of the so-called complete Roxette video collection.  Is this supposed to be funny?  I'm wondering if the folks there at EMI/Capitol Sweden are getting a laugh out of this.  First of all, it is completely unnecessary to issue the complete video collection a 3rd time when it's the same old compressed, poor transferred quality as before!  Can it get any worse?  The \\"Anyone\\" video is heavily pixilated!  And this was filmed in 1999!  There should be no excuse for the recent videos looking this way!<br /><br />EMI also decided, for reasons unknown, to make the DVD double-sided with the videos on one side and the 'MTV Unplugged' concert on the other side.  Why not just make it a dual-layer DVD with both present on one side?  Better yet, the complete Roxette video collection should not be present here unless by itself on a 2-DVD set in remastered sound and video.  The same goes for the 'MTV Unplugged'.  Instead of throwing it on a limited 4.7 GB layer disc it should be presented on a dual-layer single-sided DVD disc.  Compression hurts!  And while the 'Unplugged' isn't something necessarily to cringe over, it could have been much better, both visually and sonically.  A number of clicks and pops interrupt the audio throughout the whole show!  Perhaps this is from the source masters.  I doubt it.  Even if it is, how about a little \\"pop/click\\" removal software?  Again, remastering does not seem to be in EMI's vocabulary when it comes to Roxette DVD releases.  It's amazing how so much care was given to the CD audio, yet the DVD is a disgrace.  Don't get me wrong.  The 'Unplugged' is a joy to see -- and for the first time, the full concert!  But I expected high quality, not a half-*** effort on EMI's part.<br /><br />In terms of packaging, the release is presented with beautiful photos (some rare!), informative liner notes, and a nice layout.  Well, that is with the exception of the DVD.  Not only was the DVD poorly designed, but it was crammed in a pocket of one of the back pages.  Fans have to squeeze this out of the pocket with their fingers, subjecting it to prints and dirt.  Sloppy work, EMI!<br /><br />Rating-wise, the release gets 5 stars for the music and CD mastering.  However, it only gets 1 star for the tracklisting and DVD.  Overall, I'm giving it a generous 3-star rating because it's still a very enjoyable package for any music fan.ts for this recording in terms of alternate takes.  Maybe not much except for the '97 demo and the remixes that were issued on CD single formats.  I've always imagined this song sounding amazing with just the string section, hence an orchestral version like the ending of \\"Listen To Your Heart (Orchestral Version)\\".  This is just a personal wish, so including the album version (or perhaps a live cut?) works fine here since I'm not that fond of the demo.      Personal favorite \\"Anyone\\" makes an appearance here in both it's album version and unreleased \\"Anyone/I Love How You Love Me\\" demo.

Perhaps I'm digging too much here, but the demo featuring a medley with the Paris Sisters' 1961 smash is wonderful even if you don't like Per's raspy voice.       Like the 'Joyride' era, 'Have A Nice Day' is represented a bit too much here.  While the album is my favorite, even I have limits when it comes to making a solid 'RoxBox'!

Does the original master of \\"Listen To Your Heart\\", for example, really look that blurred?  I doubt it.  Does \\"Soul Deep\\" really look that grainy?  Maybe.  But how about re-syncing the video with a digitally remastered audio track?  Instead, EMI went the cheap way again and decided to not only use poor transfers (VHS perhaps?) but also compressed them to make them look worse yet.      2003 rolled around and fans thought maybe EMI would get it right this time with the `Ballad & Pop Hits' DVD release.  Again, it was the same thing.  Same compression.  Same quality.  Third time's a charm, right?  Well, not when it comes to Roxette.  Onceagain, EMI/Roxette decided to give the fans ANOTHER dose of the so-called complete Roxette video collection.  Is this supposed to be funny?  I'm wondering if the folks there at EMI/Capitol Sweden are getting a laugh out of this.  First of all, it is completely unnecessary to issue the complete video collection a 3rd time when it's the same old compressed, poor transferred quality as before!  Can it get any worse?  The \\"Anyone\\" video is heavily pixilated!  And this was filmed in 1999!  There should be no excuse for the recent videos looking this way!      EMI also decided, for reasons unknown, to make the DVD double-sided with the videos on one side and the 'MTV Unplugged' concert on the other side.  Why not just make it a dual-layer DVD with both present on one side?  Better yet, the complete Roxette video collection should not be present here unless by itself on a 2-DVD set in remastered sound and video.  The same goes for the 'MTV Unplugged'.  Instead of throwing it on a limited 4.7 GB layer disc it should be presented on a dual-layer single-sided DVD disc.  Compression hurts!  And while the 'Unplugged' isn't something necessarily to cringe over, it could have been much better, both visually and sonically.  A number of clicks and pops interrupt the audio throughout the whole show!  Perhaps this is from the source masters.  I doubt it.  Even if it is, how about a little \\"pop/click\\" removal software?  Again, remastering does not seem to be in EMI's vocabulary when it comes to Roxette DVD releases.  It's amazing how so much care was given to the CD audio, yet the DVD is a disgrace.  Don't get me wrong.  The 'Unplugged' is a joy to see -- and for the first time, the full concert!  But I expected high quality, not a half-*** effort on EMI's part.    In terms of packaging, the release is presented with beautiful photos (some rare!), informative liner notes, and a nice layout.  Well, that is with the exception of the DVD.  Not only was the DVD poorly designed, but it wascrammed in a pocket of one of the back pages.  Fans have to squeeze this out of the pocket with their fingers, subjecting it to prints and dirt.  Sloppy work, EMI!     Rating-wise, the release gets 5 stars for the music and CD mastering.  However, it only gets 1 star for the tracklisting and DVD.  Overall, I'm giving it a generous 3-star rating because it's still a very enjoyable package for any music fan.
B000H5U832|5.0|Not just fun and entertaining for all, but a spectacular example of the thoroughness and incredible detail that Pixar imparts to their animated movies.  Sorry Dreamworks, et al, but Pixar sets the bar!
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|OK, it's a strange movie-but my new Pink Floyd fan (15 years old) thinks it's way cool.  Package arrived quickly and in good shape-thanks!
B00005JMEW|4.0|Of the two times I sat down to watch Kill Bill Volume 1, I can say that I only fell asleep once. Watching it for the first time, I never realized how slow the story is. I actually used to make excuses about how tired I was that day I fell asleep rather than seeing what really happened. There is some amazing action in Kill Bill Volume 1, but it is neatly bundled into only a few scenes. Those scenes were great, and the marriage between live action scenes and anime shorts worked very well.  <br /> <br />The movie was pretty funny, more so than I had expected. The humor was in the writing in some parts, but also in just how ridiculously bloody the fight scenes were. Think of Kill Bill Volume 1 as a cross between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Evil Dead. From Crouching Tiger we see the live action fight scenes choreographed like Japanese anime cartoons. From Evil Dead we get high-pressured spouts of blood coming from every slash and cut.  <br /> <br />The language is not the best, but it is the fight scenes that would probably prevent you from showing this movie to young children and the squeemish.  <br /> <br />Kill Bill Volume 1 was good, but not great. I am hoping that it will gain favor with me when I see Volume 2. I have heard that they really must regarded as two parts of a whole and that it is unfair to judge them separately.  <br /> <br />Get yourself a large caffeinated beverage and enjoy Kill Bill Volume 1. That is unless my suspicions are correct and I am actually the last person to see this movie.  <br />
B000056VJ7|3.0|This CD is not a good as Meatloaf's first two.  His voice is not as deep, he just doesn't sound as good as he used to. If you have 1 and 2 you should get this to complete the collection.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's voice is so sweet.  This CD is a great addition to my Holiday music collection.  It's a great mix of Christmas classics and her own music.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love this cd. I even listen to it when it's not Christmas. My favorite song is River. It's just a great rendition of the song. Anything Sarah does is wonderful, though. I also like that this cd is not a cheesy re-do of classic songs. It won't go out of style in 5 years or annoy you if you listen to it all season long. I would suggest to anyone who likes Christmas music or Sarah, to get this cd.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I bought these to my friends, and they both really liked it. I even received it sooner then I was expecting it.   Actually I was gonna change it to  stars.
B000H5U832|5.0|One of the all time greats! Have watched it many times and still love it!
0060776757|5.0|There is no band better than U2, I love this book it is written by the band.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Great concert - great music. If you love Dream Theater, you'll love this one.  Backstage footage is excellent - Old footage from the beginning of Dream Theater (when they were still Majesty).  A must for any Dream Theater fan.
B00003BDXG|5.0|good modern day bonnie and clyde flick! plus you rarely see bad guys win at the end of movies!
B000001FRY|4.0|I have always been a fan of U2 but had little time to go through their discography. <br /> <br />Between work and school I missed all the great tours they had previously, too. <br /> <br />So, now that I am in my 30s, I am going back through all their albums, DVDs, compilations, etc. <br /> <br />I cannot lie.  I would have bought this for \\"I Will Follow\\" alone.  I only recently found out this song was inspired by Bono's mother. Now I hear the nuances I missed after first hearing many years ago on the radio. <br /> <br />You can tell already that The Edge was the genius guitarist everyone says he was. And now that I know so much about Irish/Celtic folk, classical, etc music I can hear the melodies in it so much more clearly. <br /> <br />Also, Mr. Mullen's drumming shows his \\"zen\\" kind of style, even at this point. <br /> <br />...worth every penny... <br /> <br />
B00004RJ74|5.0|words for this movie......funny,a little scary and sexy! salma looked darn good in this flick! that band playing that music was funny, and some of those women vampires was scary! good movie to rent or own!
0375505091|5.0|I am a photographer and it was great to view Annie Leibovitz book. She is without a doubt  one of the most important photographer's  of our times. I was particular interested in this book , due to her loss of her companion Susan Sontage, a great intellectual.  Her photographs of her family, friends, and assignments moved me and I am glad I own this book.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Though it's not quite on the level of Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc (my favorites), it's still a really wonderful movie. Pixar knows how to combine a great story with characters you care about.
1582701709|3.0|The Secret is another inspirational self help book. I enjoyed the format,lots of different people giving input. It got a lot of rave reviews from people on zaads, so I was sure it would be a life changing read, but it didn't have a lot of new info and to me, it was not all that impressive. I never did figure out why it was called the secret.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|They took what was potentially a very compelling storyline and then gave it to Brett Ratner. He capitalized off of the popularity of Singer's work on the previous two and then took the story and character development absolutely nowhere. It was a decent watch, though very disappointing, considering what it could have been. Though the previous two weren't classics, they were definitely better done and more interesting than this one ended up being.
0684867621|5.0|This was a gift for my sister. She really loved it. Thanks.
B000HT2PIE|1.0|My son chose this book for an 'outside reading' book report and while I agree, it was exciting and action-packed, it also validated immoral behavior and was violence packed as well.  The message 'implied' by the author is inexcusable material for children's reading and in my opinion is VERY inappropriate.  If it were a movie, it would be at least PG13, but more likely rated R for violence.  The book is dark, sinister, and has an extremely negative message regarding our country, our president, and our realtionship to other nations around the world. I regret that my son read it before I did and I will definitely not make any further purchases of books by this author.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|al gore explains in plain english the facts regarding global warming. <br />My grandson was interested in the subject and asked me questions about global warming, so i ordered the dvd for him as a present. he is 8 1/2 years old.
0060776757|5.0|The photos and the personal reflections of the band members on their formation and journey to be the greatest rock band in the world is a must have for any U2 fan.
B000056VJ7|5.0|excellent rare find cd. brand new and great fast shipping. such a deal!!! <br />
1594200823|4.0|This book tells readers uncommon information about the food most of us eat.  Pollan analyzes food groups, food productions, or food preparations. He reveals the unethicalness and inefficiencies of processed, organic, meat, poultry, fished, gathered, and vegatable foods.  He shows complex ethical issues at both ends of the spectrum, from eating at McDonald's to trying to eat and prepare just one meal - where he grew everything himself.<br /><br />Michael Pollan has a fluid and easy to follow writing style.  Reading him is kind of like eating whatever food you enjoy so much that eating one bite just makes you want to eat another, whether that be potato chips, ice cream, spaghetti, or whatever - a terrible metaphor given the nature of the book, but an accurate one.  Reading one page makes you want to read another.<br /><br />I really appreciate him emphasizing that people should watch their intake of corn products, corn syrup, carbohydrates, and processed sugars, because even a short interval of overloading the liver, kidneys, and finitely capable digestive system can lead to adult onset Type 2 diabetes.  And if this book helps temper even one person's eating enough to avoid diabetes, that would make its publication worthwhile. The book offers complex considerations for moderation, and no \\"easy to follow\\" eating plans or narrow recommendations.  It is an intelligent, thorough discussion of the issues it raises.  Where a reader may feel it is verbose, it's worth their time to scan.<br /><br />When you are done reading this book, you will know more about the unexpectedly large quantity of corn products, processed food, processed sugars and perserved/altered foods we eat.  You will be more aware of the real human and natural resource costs to consuming any type of food.  If you've been a zealot on one end of the vegatarian vs. meat-eater, organic vs. processed, atkins vs. carbohydrates or other food debates, this book will hopefully moderate some of your sensibilities and promote moderation and diversity.ities and promote moderation and diversity.
B00005NB0F|5.0|unbelievable!! A super rare find. Excellent quality, super friendly seller.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Gotta love post pretentious pearl jam. Vitalogy is creative, and kinda like pearl jam turning away from the direction they were headed in. I like 10 and VS, but they get really old after a while. Eddie's voice is cool, but they get so preachy and bland after a while. Vitalogy just rips. Last Exit is one of my favorites, as is Tremor Christ, Not For You, Corduroy, Betterman and Immortality. When I first heard Bugs, I nearly wet myself laughing. Better than Ten and Vs put together.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Sound quality is very good. <br />Picture quality is very average (and this is not a compliment). <br />Yuo may be a hardcore Waters fan but this show is highly engaging and entertaining. <br />I liked it a lot.
B000JJ4GW0|4.0|I'm sure others have noted the Bonus LIVE DVD from Milan, an hour of concert footage from the outdoor show.  While the U218 CD alone smells of a money-grab by the band's label, the Milan DVD is the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down.  Spectacular footage of Vertigo 06, highlighting the portions of show that were different than the indoor show (documented on the Chicago DVD).
B000002UAO|4.0|What can I say about the Fab Four? I bought the CD for my 17 year old daughter that didn't grow up like I did listening to the Beatles when they first came over. She loved it! I plan on buying a few more of these golden oldies for her and my 14 year old son so they can \\"discover\\" how good the old stuff really is; especially the Beatles. Their sound is just as fresh as it was in 1964!!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Having watched 90210 when I was younger, I bought the first season for my daughter, and she is hooked.  Can't wait for the other seasons to come out.
0743201140|5.0|If you are looking for passion or where you need to focus.  USE THIS BOOK.  You will find where your strengths are, along with where your time needs to be spent.  Very thourgh.  Enjoy.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|This DVD brings back such wonderful memories of Barbra's historic concert at her home in Malibu in 1986, for a cause similar to her recent 2006 tour.  The quality of this dvd is superb, and showcases Barbra's unique style and one-of-a-kind voice.  Truly, a collector's item for Streisand fans.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|I had this film on laser disc, I love it for the sharp images, color and sound. I retired my laser disc so I had to get the DVD version. It's great!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This soundtrack is a wonderful way to re-experience scenes in the movie (and isn't that exactly why you wanted it?).  It will cause you to smile all over again & everything is on it!<br /><br />(P.S.: did you know that a few of the recording artists recorded this film's soundtrack LIVE for the film?  This is just one of the several fun facts provided in the jacket information. Enjoy!)
B00009TB5G|4.0|I really haven't seen the movie, as I bought it for <br />my son. He loves it and has the first Lord of the Rings <br />Special Edition Extended Series and wanted it for <br />Christmas. I know he has watched it many times, but <br />hasn't been able to share, as he lives 2 1/2 hours <br />from me. I am not much of a movie watcher anyway and <br />look forward to purchasing the third Lord of the Rings <br />for him.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|For the third entry in the Bat series Meat teams up with Desmond Child although Jim does write about half the songs on this disc. The opening track, The Monsters Loose is done with John5 of Marilyn Manson and is not typical Meat, but he does a good job on it. From there it is total Meat Loaf and you can tell what songs are done by Jim and which are not, but this does not take away from the overall sound. I would recommend this to any Meat Loaf fan out there.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Steven's films have been getting less and less interesting and poorly produced.  Attack Force was choppy and hard to follow. The dubbing was so bad It did not even slightly sound like Steven. <br />Very disappointed and I have always really liked Seagal films. <br /> <br />Dixie Light
B00006FM77|5.0|One of the greatest bands of the pop/rock world in full swing! All of Chicago's indispensable tunes are there and the recording, in the present Rhino transfer, is more than adequate; and, to top it all,the documentation and packaging should be seen as a model by the industry. This box-set would definitely be part of my remote planet discography !
0876852630|4.0|This is a plain and simple look at some of the guiltier pleasures that we all secretly yearn for, and the pain and tragedy that comes after.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Well from track one flesh storm you know slayer is back and better then ever simply a almost flawless record some of my faves were jyhad flesh storm eyes of the insane and cult were all pretty solid tracks could very well be comeback album of the year.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|As a big fan of the series - I was hoping for a boxset that I could be proud of and this is it. It has everything, all the special features from the previous boxsets and more and just look at that Presidential Seal!!! The presentation is fantastic along with a nice glossy booklet and the Pilot's script.  <br /> <br />It's worth noting that I was going to purchase the UK version but this boxset contains more extras, is better presented and it's cheaper! Even if you include the import, postage costs! <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the series or just looking for a great TV drama - then this is it.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Every album by a.a. has been good verus the world was great and fate of norns was almost flawless with oden on my side is such a great album from vallhalla awaits me to prediction of warfare.Being a member of the astru faith this cd has become like a musical bible for me i listen to this cd alot and bar none no other metal band could touch this album this year.Their were many good albums from slayer, celtic frost,hammerfall, cannibal corpse, deicide,sepultura but none of them could touch this cd.My personal faves were cry of the black birds,runes to my memory, and god's of war arise, this cd gets my vote for album of the year but could be in the running for metal album of the decade.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I'm enjoying listening to Awake, particularly the latter half of the album; although, it doesn't match the quality and impact of the very 1st album, which is still my favourite.
B000055ZDT|5.0|If you want DOOM you got it great album simply flawless
B000I5X81K|1.0|I am a huge Groban fan, however, found this sadly lacking. I wouldn't have even rated it a 1. There was not one song that I liked. Perhaps he needs to return to some of his writers from the past...Tossed it in the garbage...save your money.
B000002G6J|5.0|Eternal in beauty, in refined arrangements, in smoothness, perfect for a erotico- romantic night.
0937381888|5.0|I bought the 2nd edition a year ago when I first started brewing.  I knew absolutely nothing about the subject.  This book got me started and I am still learning the further I get into it and the more I play around with brewing possibilities.  The new edition brings it up-to-date since homebrewing is becoming more popular, meaning more 'stuff' on the market for brewing.  this is the only book I have read on brewing but I have never had to look elsewhere for answers.  I refer to it often.  I gave the 2nd edition to my buddy and bought this one.
B00005JPAJ|3.0|Three films rolled into one, with Brad Pitt almost ruining the whole thing.  Not as good as Amores Peros, but better than 21 Grams.  Worth seeing.
0974153001|4.0|4 stars for this one.  I like DIY projects with a challenge, but this was WAY over my head.  Only for a person who has worked with polymer clay before.  There was no instruction how to get rid of certain blemishes.  I should have started out with a beginner book.  Time and effort wasted on my part.  The book itself has lovely full color instructions with the step-by-step process.
6305907145|5.0|This movie combines the proprieties of Jane Austen's world with sexy subtleties of today's filmmaking. Although Jane Austen fans will complain that it does not follow the book's storyline and some of the characters are altered, audiences should note that the credits at the beginning of the movie say that it is based on Mansfield Park and some of Jane Austen's letters and journals, and therefore will be somewhat different from the book. The movie is well-cast, well edited, and overall very well done.
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|Funny, funny, funny!  Everything in this movie is hilarious!  I highly recommend this if you're in a kinda crazy-comedic mood.  The teen angst is slightly overwhelming, but that's to be expected.  Not for the meek, it has quite a long shot of full-frontal male nudity going on, so be aware of that.  Not to mention there's a few topless scenes of women as well.  Overall, it made me double over with continuous laughter!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS SHOW SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT, AND I TOTALLY LOVE IT!!!  THE ACTORS ARE GREAT, FUNNY AND HOT!!!  THE SHOW IS FULL OF SURPRISES, SUSPENSE, LAUGHTER, ACTION, GHOSTS, FAMILY LOVE AND SO MUCH MORE.  I 100% RECOMMEND THIS SHOW!!!!!  GET IT EVERYONE, U WONT REGRET IT!!!  CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2 TO COME OUT ON DVD!!!
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my younger brother, and he loved it! It seemed like there was more to it than was shown on the box - it was much bigger and had more acessories than we would have thought. The smaller gun that comes off of the bigger one was a treat because my nephew also got to share in the fun. The only unfortunate part of this choice was that I became the target! :)
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was fiction but it dispicted a lot of the hardship that occured during that period in America. The South was devasted by the aggression of the north. They were raped and pillaged for many years during that time and for many years afterward. The northern liberals still try to keep the South down and instill their way of life upon us.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Sarah comes through with wonderful winter holiday tunes. I especially liked the covers of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" and Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\".
B000002J09|5.0|I had this album when it was new and loved it.  I bought the cd for my daughter recently and it is now her favorite.  She is introducing her friends to Led Zeppelin now and there is a new generation loving it.
0895260131|5.0|I am a long time student of history and found this book entertaining as well as on target for turning the light up real bright on the history of Islam.  I believe that this book should be required reading for every High School Junior.  I have no doubts that there will be those who have a different and opposing thought on this book but I would ask them to examine the true motivation in their hearts for their defense of Islam.  Is it emotional or logical and what exactly is the source of their knowledge?
B000I0QK74|5.0|Great CD!!  We listened to it a lot over the holiday season!!
0743289412|5.0|Just when I thought Stephen King retired, imagine my surprise when I learned that he had written a new book.  Not only that, but I also learned that it was a love story!  So, I bought the book with interest and great expectations.  What I should have realized is that a \\"love story\\" for Stephen King means something different than what it might mean for anyone else.  This book was one of the most well-written books by this author in some time.  The characters, the plot, and the story (including the love story angle) are all written in the tradition of this master of horror.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As I read it, one thing I kept wondering was whether Lisey's story had any parallels to Tabitha King's life experiences.  Whatever the answer, it's a good read.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|A SUPERB transfer of the old Sci-Fi film, complete with bonus material AND a neat storage box, complete with a model of Robby!  ALL the old sci-fi movies need to be re-mastered and repackaged like this one!  Buy this DVD set, and you will NOT be disappointed!  Today's kids, especially, need to watch seminal movies like this for references in today's digital world.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|Sure the story is not very deep, and relies on some convoluted coincidences (how come no-one can work out Crockett and Tubbs are policemen despite the number of times they meet their colleagues in the open?), and Colin Farrell looks like a cheap Mexican bandit.  But that's not the point.  Miami Vice is about the emotional commitment of the lead characters to their job, and works by creating the mood and being honest to the style and feeling of the TV series.  If you are going to live in a shady world, it says, at least its fun to do it in a shady world full of sunshine and fast cars. \\"You would hate this if it only had slow cars and boats\\" my wife said.  But no - maybe it would be less exciting on one level, but it would be no less emotionally honest, and would still touch the right buttons.
0618680004|5.0|This book sums up everything I've always known or wanted to know.  I just can't believe that so many people in our world are brainwashed and believe in the fantasy of a \\"god\\".  Now they're saying that the earth is very young compared to the OVERWHELMING physical evidence that it's been here for thousands and thousands of years.  And not only that, they believe it's OK to discriminate, persecute and even murder in the name of their religion.  While they preach compassion for others, they are committing \\"sins\\" against all those who don't believe they way they do.  Thank you, Richard Dawkins, for putting it all in a wonderful book!
B00005JNS0|5.0|We loved this movie ! I even took my nephew to see it at the Drive-In last summer. Don't miss it, no matter what your age.
B000069KE0|5.0|this cd is faboulous in sound and quality among being one of the best ones they made. great selection and value for the money. extremly satisfied. they are one of the best groups of the 60's and 70's.
0525948023|5.0|The sort of thing you will read in 'A New Earth' is:  \\"How to be at peace now?  By making peace with the present moment.  The present moment is the field on which the game of life happens.  It cannot happen anywhere else.\\" \\"There are three words that convey the secret of the art of living, the secret of all success and happiness:  One With Life.  Being one with life is being one with now.  You then realize that you don't live your life, but life lives you.  Life is the dancer, and you are the dance.\\"<br /><br />Think about that.  Sure, we have control over our lives,  but how much?  Aren't people around us an influenece on that?  How much control do we have over them?  Also, how much control do we have over the genes we inherited which has implications to our health, mentality, or how long this life is.<br /><br />Accepting the present moment as it is makes sense to me.  Can we change the present moment by living in the past or the future?<br /><br />I read Eckhart's book \\"The Power of Now\\" also.  Eckhart is on my list of top three authors.
B000069KGM|5.0|chicago is for real. they sound as good live or even better than the recording. this cd and the 2nd one (CHICAGO) is their best ever. these are a must have collection. the quality and sound is excellent as well as the mix. extremely satisfied.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually has a title that may not get your attention- but don't be put off- this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen! I watch it whenever I need a lift! Great cast, neat little vignettes, and all taking place at Christmas! If you watch it once, you'll watch it often!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|THIS IS LIVING PROOF THAT NO BAND HAS BEEN ABLE SINCE THE MID SIXTIES TO COME EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT PINK FLOYD WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE DAYS WHEN TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITED. THE LIGHTING, THE SOUND, EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST ONE HELLUVA SPECTACLE FROM START TO FINISH. THE MOST VALUABLE DVD IN MY COLLECTION. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!
B000AMUU94|3.0|For the casual Bowie fan this is a pretty good and pretty thorough collection, spreading across the breadth of what is widely considered his classic years, and including most of his well known songs, as well as a hit and miss selection of various rarities and semi-rarities. But is the song selection here as good as it could be? Is it listenable all the way through? Does it contain any bad songs? And what purpose does it serve in a world that already contains several Bowie compilations?<br /><br />The real reason to consider this compilation is for the third disc, as the other two are available separately. Bowie's 80's period (discounting Scary Monsters)is the one in most need of a compilation cd as it was his weakest era. Let's Dance, Tonight, and Never Let Me Down are really of interest only for their singles and frankly not worth buying to anyone but a diehard. A compilation that simply rounded up the singles from these three albums would nicely fill a gap in Bowie's catalogue. Does disc 3 of the platinum collection fit the bill? Not quite. For one thing, the superb song \\"Never Let Me Down\\", from the mostly bad album of the same name, is inexplicably ommitted in favor of dreck such as \\"Underground\\" from the Labyrinth movie, and various other movie soundtrack songs that, while handy to get in one place like this, are generally from very decent soundtracks that would be worth having on their own. Futhermore in the effort to cram as many songs, including various sundry rarities, on here as possible, the compiliers have resorted to inferior edited versions of some key songs. Thank God they at least seem to have chosen the soundtrack version of Cat People (judging by the amazon song sample) instead of the absolutely wretched remake that mars the \\"Let's Dance\\" album. [Incidently, the Cat People remake is the very thing thing that pushes Let's Dance from a mediocre album to a bad one in my book, knocking it off my to-buy list and making this compilation tempting in the first place because of its inclusion of the 3 excellent Let's Dance singles].<br /><br />However, despite what appears to be the inclusion of the original version of Cat People, they have chopped off two minutes of the song, a butchery job which borders on blasphemy! I really wonder why compilers think that this sort of thing is acceptable these days. Arbirarily cutting off minutes this way just to save space shows a real lack of respect for a recorded song as a performance and a peice of art. Can anyone imagine \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" or \\"I am the Walrus\\" or \\"Hey Jude\\" with two minutes lopped off? Would they be just as good? No? Then why do it here? The soundtrack version of \\"Cat People\\" is one of Bowie's very finest vocal performances and is somewhat hard to find on a Bowie cd in its original 6 minute plus version. If the idea was to include some genuinely worthwhile rarities from this era, an unedited \\"Cat People\\" should have been top of the list. But instead they amputate two whole minutes. I'm sure apologists for this kind of mutilation have their reasons. Perhaps someone will say this edit was actually some obscure 7 inch single version and not a new edit made specifically for this compilation. Regardless of such irrelvencies, everyone knows the definitive version of \\"Cat People\\" is the 6 minute plus version, so why not include it? If space was the only reason, I would gladly get rid of boring rarity-for-rarity's-sake crud like \\"Drowned\\" and \\"Alabama Song\\" that drag down the momentum of this cd anyway, to get back those 2 minutes of one of my all time favorite Bowie songs.<br /><br />Disc 2 has a similar problem in the severely edited version of \\"Young Americans\\". Some songs simply need to be heard in full. These two are prime examples. As a result it's hard to reccomend this album and I consider it a botched oppurtunity to make sense of Bowie's 80's output.<br /><br />Finally, as the Best of David Bowie 1969-1974 and 1974-1979 respectivly, are identical to disc one and two of this set, it seems to be adding insult to injury not to make disc 3 available separately as well---perhaps they thought it wouldn't sell on its own. Instead, those who own the first two discs already in the form of the earlier collections would be forced to duplicate them if they simply wanted the third disc as a representation of bowie's 80's period.<br /><br />Though I might make this compilation sound pretty bad, it does enough things right to make itself tempting (such as collecting together some essential singles and rarities, especially from the shaky 80's period) and, in its favor, it actually could have been much worse. At the very least the compilers should be lauded for having the good taste not to include that horrendous monstrosity of a cover of \\"Dancing in the Street\\" Bowie did with Mick Jagger in the early 80's. I consider that abomination to be Bowie's absolute career low point and hands down THE worst song he's ever recorded bar none (yes I have heard the entire Deram Anthology including the infamous \\"Laughing Gnome\\", Dancing in the Street is worse). I cannot even listen to Dancing in the Street all the way through without feeling the overwhelming urge to press skip and actually got rid of the otherwise excellent \\"Singles Collection 1969-1993\\" simply because I was tired of having to get up and skip that godawful song every time I listened to it. So, simply by not including \\"Dancing in the Street\\", this collection earns an extra star from me, bringing it up from a 2 to a 3. And I truly hope this precedent becomes a trend for all future retrospective Bowie compilations.<br /><br />To end on a more positive note, disc one of this album is a terrific encapsulation of bowie's glam period. It includes great rarities such as \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" and the almost impossible to find Bowie version of \\"All the Young Dudes\\", which is almost enough on it's own to make it worth buying, even if it does include a bit too much from Aladdin Sane.

All I can say is, \\"I have my collector's copy\\", and that's the bottom line.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I get goosebumps if I think about having this remastered album when it was originally realeased in the 70 's (on CD which was then a pipe dream for most of us)). Nothing would have touched it. The sound is so much better, the vocals so much clearer. What more can I say. Buy the damn thing and dont forget about \\"Don't Look Back\\" as well.

B000ICM5IK|5.0|...for what it's worth, as a retrospective of the five previous Rocky movies, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is a fitting tribute to the series. <br /> <br />Like many fans, I enjoyed Bill Conti's classy new compositions for the film itself. But I guess I can understand why MGM and Conti decided to release a \\"greatest hits\\" style album instead - after all, the film itself is kind of an appreciation of the Rocky legacy and a reflection on the old days, so it's rather fitting that this compilation would capture that same spirit. <br /> <br />Purists may be a bit upset over the fact that many classic tracks - such as \\"Going the Distance\\" - have been slightly edited. For example, in the beginning of the aforementioned song an audio clip from \\"Rocky II\\" has been inserted over the introductory instruments (Adrian telling Rocky to \\"win\\" as the song is starting up). It's cool, but also kind of annoying for people who just want the original songs in their original forms, and this trend continues throughout the album. Most of the time it's BEFORE the song starts (e.g. on \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" there's a quote from the Rocky Balboa film delivered by Stallone to the athletics board which lasts for about 10 - 15 seconds). Some of the quotes make the songs better, and some of them are just out of place and kind of freaky. It's strange to start getting pumped up by the familiar song and suddenly hear some loud voice telling you \\"WIN!\\", but whatever. <br /> <br />I particularly liked John X's remix of \\"Gonna Fly Now.\\" It mixes quotes from the films in the series with updated instrumentals, but it doesn't totally rape the original as many remixes do - it's a respectful remix. <br /> <br />You also get the new Three Six Mafia song \\"It's a Fight\\" which is cool. <br /> <br />Overall my thoughts on this are: as a retrospective of the Rocky series with remastered tracks and some new material thrown in, it's pretty amazing. Many \\"greatest hits\\" compilations have been far worse. They had the smarts to keep the good tracks and not go for overkill - there's none of that awful early '90s rap soundtrack from \\"Rocky V\\" here. (Unless you are a huge fan of MC Hammer, in which case I advise you to go purchase the original Rocky V soundtrack.) <br /> <br />It's missing a few tracks that would have been nice - most notably the training theme from Rocky IV - but I also get the feeling that these tracks are more for the die-hard Rocky enthusiasts and would seem a bit out of place for the casual listener. That Rocky IV training theme was kind of outdated anyway, but hell, I love it for nostalgic value. <br /> <br />I'm disappointed that MGM didn't issue an actual soundtrack for Rocky Balboa (since Conti did some amazing work on the new film reminiscent of the original in many ways) but I'm hoping that may come out at a later point in time. Until then this is a great retrospective that fans will enjoy. Rip it to your PC and put it on your iPod for a workout session, it will have you thinking you're in a training montage in no time at all.

B0007YXRFE|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies you will see, if you can handle it. This is a very witty parody on the war in Iraq, foriegn policy, the attitude of the American people, the attitude of the rest of the world toward the USofA, and of course know-it-all celebrities. All the while done with puppets with visible strings intentionally made to look so cheesy that one cannot help but be thoroughly entertained despite how seriously one's political views may be. Every action movie, every stereotype, and every possible political point of view is the target of ridicule here.<br />So this movie is not for everyone. It is not for the easily offended. As expected from Parker and Stone there is wonderfully crude and deliciously politically incorrect humor. So it's not for younger viewers and probably not for older viewers over 50. So don't be writing angry letters if you accidentally let your children see it.<br />Now you've been warned. Give it a try if you think you can handle it.

B00004WIDQ|4.0|The idea behind this movie was a rather ingenius plotline. The special effects were superb. It beat the hell out of the cheesy dinosaur flicks in the fifties and sixties, not only in the special effects department, but in the storyline as well.<br /><br />However the suspense and the raw viciousness of the carnivorous beasts seemed to have been kept to a minimum, or at least contained, so that this movie could remain \\"family oriented\\". Now I'm not saying that it's necessary to give children nightmares, but as is typical in hollywood family movies the only characters that would become seriously injured or devoured would be characters that no one would miss. The lawyer, the annoying fat guy 'Newman', the token black guy 'Sam Jackson', and of course the macho thick egoed hunter guy. You know, those characters whom were designed specifically to \\"die\\". Of course our heroes will be safe, and especially the children will evert a tragic demise. God forbid children would be killed in a hollywood film. Even though realistically the children probably would have been the first to get captured, being smaller and probably easier to chew. But Spielberg did not want to answer angry letters from soccer moms and other sensitive Americans from the midwest, so he kept the movie enjoyable for the whole family.<br /><br />Overall it was an entertaining movie. I would recommend seeing it. But avoid the sequels at all costs.

B000JSDPUU|3.0|Jack Reacher is my very favorite fictional Tough Guy action figure. He could probably get Iraq squared-away single-handed. Unfortunately, his creator, Lee Child, seems to be giving him R&R for most of THE HARD WAY.<br /><br />Ex-Army Military Police major Reacher, now demobbed from the service with the end of the Cold War and on the lam from a normal existence, is in New York City. Here, he becomes employed by the head of a mercenary-for-hire company, Edward Lane, to investigate the kidnapping of the latter's wife, Kate, and young daughter, Jade. Over the course of the first few chapters, $10.5 million are paid out in several installments, but with no return of the hostages. Kate and Jade are presumed dead, and Edward wants revenge. Jack's new instructions are to find the perp, at the conclusion of which Reacher will be paid $1 million. Complications arise when Jack discovers that Lane's previous wife, Anne, was also kidnapped and subsequently found dead. Anne's sister is convinced Edward was behind Anne's murder, as does ex-FBI agent Lauren Pauling, who's residual guilt from not having solved the first case compels her to team with Reacher on this one.<br /><br />It isn't until page 342 of this 371-page book that Jack swings into serious action by breaking the gun arms of three bad guys with an iron fire poker. Up until then, Reacher is investigating relatively non-violently, with a periodic time-out for sack time with the engaging Pauling. The book might as well be entitled JACK'S WORKING VACATION, and the role of Reacher himself could be filled by any world-weary police detective or private eye that's been featured in any other fictional series that you've ever read. Even Dirty Harry, knowing how to \\"make my day\\", shot an occasional scumbag at various times during a film to keep things interesting for the viewer over the long haul. It isn't until the last few pages that Reacher becomes satisfyingly lethal with the help of a mirror on a stick.<br /><br />Mind you, THE HARD WAY might be considered a really good read when isolated in a vacuum. But, compared to the others in the series, it had me yawning.onsidered a really good read when isolated in a vacuum. But, compared to the others in the series, it had me yawning.
0743277708|4.0|My sister gave me this book for Christmas.  I had adopted a rabbit (who was bound for slaughter) over the summer so I was especially interested in reading this book.      As it takes place in southern England some of the terms and style of writing were unfamiliar to me, but I got used to it after the first hundred pages or so.      Overall a great book for anyone.  And you do actually learn quite a few facts about rabbits that might come in handy at some point!
0618680004|4.0|I have been an Atheist or non believer or whatever you want to call it since I was 8 or 9 years old.  I have always had a difficult time understanding why so many people have such difficulties freeing themselves from Christian indoctrination.  I also usually don't care much about someone else's religion or non-religion and so I have never read a book of this type before. <br />I really liked Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale, so I thought I would give it a try.  It certainly was worth the read, because among a few other things, I think I understand a little more about why others have so much more difficulty freeing themselves from outlandish ideas. <br />However, I can't give a full 5 stars because Dawkins is suffering too much anger or upset with religious fundamentalists and he has allowed it to come through into his writing.  He will be writing a paragraph and suddenly the idea or concept will change or his anger will begin to show through.  The text is simply not written vary elegantly nor in the form of a detached scientist. From his previous writing I believe he could have done better. At one point he even seems to express that he knows this is true. <br />Never-the-less, I still recommend this book.

B00005JP9V|4.0|In the dreary, toxic, terrorist filled Britain circa 2027 of Alfonso Cuaron's \\"Children of Men\\" there is no hope...only despair and the television and billboards scream out at you about something called \\"Quietus: YOU decide when.\\" In other words, the world is so rancid, the youngest person in the world, an 18 year old boy, has just died, there is mass infertility and basically the only choice left to you is when to die.<br /><br />Theo (a rumpled, emotionally depleted Clive Owen) was once a revolutionary, an activist but now he is merely a bureaucrat scratching out an existence when one day an old flame and current freedom fighter, Julian (Julianne Moore in a cameo) approaches him or more to the point has him kidnapped, bound and gagged and brought to her to ask a favor. This favor changes his life, gives him a little hope and introduces him to Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a young black woman who is unbelievably with child.<br /><br />Adapted from a story by the excellent writer, P.D. James, \\"Children of Men,\\" offers more than a glimmer of hope and the idea that the world can be saved via a baby is a very Christian conceit. That this child is issued from the loins of, in the world of this film, a reviled, \\"immigrant\\" only makes the birth that much more resonant and thoughtful. There is a magical and very emotional scene towards the end of the film in which the revolutionaries are battling with the army, machine gun fire everywhere, bodies dropping like flies and Kee, Theo and the newborn baby descend a crumbling staircase and everything stops as army, revos and everyone one else realizes what Kee is carrying: a child yes but also a miracle, a beacon of hope, a hope for salvation. Interestingly enough, this scene, instead of being hokey, isn't because once Kee and child are outside the fighting immediately continues full bore: life goes on.<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" is a cautionary film and one that is particularly creepy yet visionary because it is not set some 100 years but a mere 20 years hence. The Britain here looks pretty much like it does today just seedier and unkempt: annihilation doesn't come by way of one big blast; it comes slowly yet inevitably creeping up upon us...little by little.e 20 years hence.

B000001FKY|3.0|This isn't even Def Leppard's best album, let alone one of the best ever. (I like Pyromania better.)

But the one word titles, like \\"Animal,\\" \\"Women,\\" and \\"Rocket\\" tend to blend together for me, and even now I can't tell them apart. Stick with Pyromania if you're new to Def Leppard.
B000E1155E|2.0|To quote The Who, who are among the dozen or so bands whose sound was pirated for this album, the Arctic Monkeys were given way too much praise way to fast.  Before this album came out British magazines like Q and NME were already labeling it as one of the best British albums to ever come out.  And this is from an island that has produced some great music, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Stones, The Clash, Sex Pistols..., I could go on until i'm blue in the face.  To group the Arctic Monkey's in with those bands seems blasphemous to me.   <br /> <br />Musically the band is ok.  I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor, and A Certain Romance are catchy enough.  The Arctic Monkey's bring some decent hooks to the table, but what they do not bring is anything approaching originality.  They not only pirated a bunch of classic rock bands for their sound, you only have to go back a year or two to see that they have also \\"borrowed\\" from bands like Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, and The Strokes.  I'm not saying that those bands are anything special either, but they at least attempt to make the sound that they borrowed from classic rock and post punk their own, the Arctic Monkey's don't even try to sound original.   <br /> <br />I'm not one of these listeners who will say that this is good because they are only just barely turning 20.  I don't care how old they are, this album is simply not special.  For those people who like it, I can see why you do, it's catchy, and has fairly clever lyrics.  I would just encourage you to seek out some of the bands influences before any grand hyperbole about their greatness is arrived at.   <br /> <br />This is the second year in a row that an album that is deemed the best of the year has disapointed.  Last year Sufjan Stevens bloated mess was showered with major praise, and this year the Arctic Monkeys have failed to live up to the hype.  I'm off to listen to Joanna Newsom, hopefully her overhyped album won't disapoint.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|Seeing as how there are 260 other reviews (as of this writing) ahead of this one, I would guess that just about every thing that could be said about this terrific movie HAS been said.  Rather than bore the reader, let me just suffice to say that the viewer of \\"Forbidden Planet\\" is truly in for a treat.  The unusual tonal sound quality, great matte painting, wonderful (for the time) special effects, introduction of Robbie the Robot, and a great cast including Leslie Neilsen (as a serious actor) Walter Pidgeon, beautiful Anne Francis, Warren Stevens, and Earl Holliman make this a great film for all science fiction fans.<br /><br />In this humble reviewer's opinion, \\"Forbidden Planet\\" ranks with the great of this era which included, \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\", The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man\\", \\"Them\\", \\"The Thing\\", and \\"War of the Worlds\\".  If you are a collector of the science fiction films of this era, then \\"Forbidden Planet\\" MUST find a place on your shelf.<br /><br />The transfer of the film to DVD is very solid.  The 5.1 surround sound is terrific and the extras (including the film, \\"The Invisible Boy\\") that are  part of this 50th Anniversary Special Edition make for a great value.  ENJOY!

B000K4WPCC|3.0|You see I'm not sure if it is the character himself or if it is the actor (Sebastian Stan) whom is making Chase so damn boring.  Could be both.  The dialogue was pretty trite for him and the delivery was bland.  Chase doesn't come off threatening, dangerous or even psychotic enough to be a serious bad guy.  Voldemort he is not and although this story is nowhere near as grand as the \\"Potter\\" franchise, there should at least be some parity between the main enemies.  Ya know like Optimus Prime & Megatron, Lion-O & Mumm-Ra, Batman & The Joker, Professor X & Magneto, etc. True, Chase had the power before Caleb and everything but in the end their power levels became equal but even before that happened, Caleb had more presence and Chase never really seemed his equal let alone his superior.  Maybe that has something to do with the actor (Steven Strait, he was real good as Warren Peace in \\"Sky High\\"). If they're going to do a sequel, they should make Chase more menacing to give Caleb a better nemesis to work with.

0694003611|5.0|Goodnight Moon is a wonderful bedtime book.  It switches between black & white and color pages. It is a very simple, calm story that lulls a child to sleep.  I received it as a gift when my first child was born.  I now give it as a gift at all baby showers I attend.
6305754969|4.0|I happen to be a big fan of Olaf Wieghorst and own an original oil.  The vehicle of DVD is ideal for the purposes I bought this particular movie. I realize that many purchasers will care less about the item I like the most and that was the eight or more paintings by Olaf that come with the beginning credits. When a picture or painting comes on the screen the DVD can be be paused and the painting can be studied.  It is a great experience.  I hope that this review will encourage others to watch the movie with the eye of a western art lover.
0920668372|5.0|This is a wonderful story about a parents love for their child.  \\"I Love you forever, I like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be\\" is the sweetest refrain of this book.  The book presents the child at all ages and on to when they have a child of their own.  It took a while for me to read it without getting teary.
B0000YWKHC|5.0|Some people really don't like this movie, and to be honest, when I first saw this in the theaters, I didn't like it either.  But after thinking about it, and then seeing it again, I LOVED it.  It's a quirky relationship between the two main characters, both of whom are currently involved with someone else.  Some people have an issue with the fact that Japan wasn't portrayed perfectly (I wouldn't know) or that the main characters are unfaithful to their spouses or whatever.  But, I came to adore the two main characters and pretty much despise everyone else in the film.  It's like two soulmates finally meet, but can do nothing about it.  This is a chill kinda movie. I love the music too and have the soundtrack.  Tidbit for ya: The two main characters never introduce themselves to each other.  It's just a quirky neat movie.
0307276902|5.0|I wanted to read this book since it was so controversial with Oprah and her soapbox. I had expected to hate it but ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! THe author is a great writer and even though he made up some of his details, he should be given credit where credit is due regardless of what Oprah has to say. Great book and you wont be able to put it down.

B000H30B2C|2.0|Peter Jackson is a talented filmmaker and I was excited to delve into this extended edition of King Kong. Unfortunately, this film has been overhyped and falls flat when all is said and done. There is no doubt that some of the action scenes are outstanding and the cinematography is nice. What brings the film down is the fact that it is needlessly long. The first hour is boring at times and could have been easily condensed. While the action scenes are done well, they sometimes drag on to the point they are not as exciting as they should have been. By the end of the film I was honestly hoping the film would just end.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|This is a great cd! I have their original album, but this one is so much better. As usual, I had received great customer service with Amazon and my shipment was extremely fast. Highly recommend this item!
6302968135|5.0|My son loves this movie. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Great price.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it, when it was called THE WRATH OF KHAN!  This movie is a complete and utter rip-off of Star Trek II.  I had very high hopes for this film and was completely let down.  I guess it is ok for a casual Sci-Fi fan but as a Star Trek film it just does not work for me.  If you want to see a great sci-fi/Star Trek film go buy Wrath of Khan.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Good CD, but it fails to completely live up to what I've come to expect from MCR. On their other albums, I LOVED every single song. On this one, it has it's moments of MCR brilliance. But on the majority of the songs, I find myself saying, \\"That sounds a lot like the last song\\". Don't get me wrong; still definitely worth the buy. Still some of the best music out there; I just know MCR is capable of greater music. And you gotta love an album whose first song is entitled \\"The End\\". Te-he. Best songs: Mama, Teenagers, Black Parade, & Cancer.
6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll is by far one of the best anime movies of all times as far as I'm concerned. Violent, well animted, and a decent story line. So if you like violence and a bit of a story this movie is for you. A grusomely awsome movie.
0783225547|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  Unfortunately it came out at a bad time and never got the recognition it should have.  It had adventure, suspense, and a lot of action, along with an offbeat love story. It's a great movie for all.
B0008JIJ2E|2.0|For a large part of the dvd, there was a great deal of skipping.  The dvd is obviously defective.  I haven't watched since.  It would be great if we could get a replacement.
B00063F8B2|5.0|This is a wonderful CD...my son loves the movie and having his favorite songs from it help pacify him when he can't watch it.  Well worth the money!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I am probably the only person who can wear out a cd! WINTERSONG is so beautiful! It is truely, one of the best seasonal cds on the market.
0689859414|5.0|What a wonderful, magical, fantastical book!  I'm always trying to get my granddaughter to read and the 'Spiderwick' series has captured her 9-yr. old imagination!  This is a great companion book to the series.  It made a very special Christmas gift for Karlee!
B0001I55SS|4.0|In a way, it's a pity that the Black Hole came out after (and because of) Star Wars as this movie, like so many others of the times, tried to be in part another Star Wars. And in that it fails miserably. And sadly, the Black Hole also tries to be another 2001: A Space Odyssey-- and in that, it also fails. <br /> <br />The problem was that Disney had a really great idea but executed really badly. I don't often use the word cheesy to describe anything because I think that word is over used by people who don't appreciate the effort that goes into the special effects of any time period compared to this one now. But the Black Hole's SFX *were* cheesy: while some were brilliant, too many were people and things hanging on wires that could be seen or less than great animation. Too many of the effects look sadly like they were made on a $1.98 budget. <br /> <br />Yet some of the model work for the spachsips were incredibly well done and some of the set designs were superior to anything up to that time. It's this combination of the really great and the incredibly lousy that makes this film hard to say that is a bad film. because in many ways, it isn't; it's a very good film bogged down sometimes by crappy special effects and bad direction, but overall the film surpasses it many bad parts to become something very enjoyable and worth watching. I only regret that while the widescreen version of this movie is fairly cheap, the full screen version costs twice as much! What's up with that?
B000I5X81K|5.0|Awesome CD with lots of new and great sounds from Josh but the special edition has 2 extra songs and the last song on it is worth the extra money.
B0000027EP|5.0|This one ranks among Motorhead's finest. No weak tracks and even a little experimentation (Nightmare/Dreamtime, 1916) which Motorhead rarely dwell into. This should be right up there with Ace Of Spades.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|The very best of Josh, so far, I recommend this special edition Awake over the regular one because the last song on this CD is so great. Enjoy
B000ION79Y|1.0|This was the worst Seagal movie ever made...It was confusing, dark, stupid plot and they made his voice sound like the Marlboro man with cancer.  I used to love his movies but if this is the stuff he is now making he is all washed up.  He fights like a old man in the movie too...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY...Too Bad...he used to be great!
B000K4WPCC|2.0|Where do you find a school like this where every student there is like a chiseled out marble statue of a Greek god?  Do scared high school girls really wander the halls anywhere at 2:00am wearing just a towel after taking a shower in a place where male high school boys just walk in and out of the community shower at will?  And what's with that?  This is some private academy with suites for rooms and the students don't even have their own bathrooms?  Is that a bird?  A plane?  No, it's a .....Hummer?  Hey, good buddy, I just had a head-on with a Mustang convertible and my thirty thousand pound payload didn't even scratch the paint on that Ford pony car.   This film was a charmed episode with four guys replacing the three girls and it wasn't charming.  Young ladies might like the naked and and semi-naked boys and guys might go for the cute coeds who like to lounge around wearing not a lot.  Okay, the movie wasn't all bad.  If however you are watching a film for..Oh, I don't know...a plot maybe that makes some kind of sense..This isn't it.  The acting was pretty bad and while the special effects were done pretty well, they were just plain silly.  I did learn something about myself though, watching this movie.  If I really put my mind to it, even this clunker couldn't put me to sleep.   One final note:  The person watching this movie with me actually liked it..What can I say?
B000HIVO64|5.0|I'm a relatively new Beck fan so I'm reading the other review comparing <br />and saying it's not was good as some of if his but I'm really loving this one a lot. The dvd is fun and I so far like \\"I think I'm love\\" the best on the dvd and on the cd all but Movie Theme to me stands out. God, it is just so beautiful, it sounds like what I hear in my head  when I daydream. <br />What a talent this man is.  <br />
B00001ODGR|2.0|Potential for a great DVD concert, but like so many others out there, they fell flat on their face when it came to the recording quality. <br />If you like monotone, flat leveled music with no definition or separation of highs and lows, and vocal and instrumental, you'll enjoy this.  No solos stand out...in fact, nothing stands out.   <br />My advice...watch the concert, play a cd with another system. <br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Time is on their side. The Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart songs have proven that they are some of the most intelligent and sophisticated tunes in pop history. I'm happy to see Ms. Krall give these tunes due respect with lush arrangements and great  singing and phrasing. I think she works well in either a small jazz combo or with a full ork. She should consider doing the entire songbooks of each of the great songwriters just like Ella did over 40 years ago. She can bring the entire songbooks to new generations. You just can't beat a good song, and Diana does them so well. I love rock and roll, but most of the songs only work within the confines of the original group because the songs don't lend themselves to different personalities or are not really that melodic. Can you imagine Tony Bennett singing \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\"? If you're a fan of Krall or love high class sounds..you won't be dissapointed with this CD! Thanks again for giving new life to old evergreens.  <br />
067088278X|5.0|Our tot loved this book, starting at about 6 or 9 months, and for many thereafter.  It has great illustrations - not too simple, but not too complicated.  They have fun details to hunt through; besides the characters, there are little bunnies and birds, etc. on each page.  The script is excellent - not too many words, and a good rhyme scheme.  The text on each page alludes to what's coming next.  Very good first book.
B00005JOLI|2.0|I have never read Eragon, but I was attracted by the advert with the beautiful dragons and epic scenary. I was really, really, disappointed to find myself sitting through another re-hash of Star Wars- but with dragons. I might even have been able to take the storyline, if the lines were good. But all the lines were so bland, so utterly immature I found myself yawning within the first 15 minutes. I've seen more mature dialog in a saturday morning cartoon.<br /><br />The costuming was pretty good, particularly the dragon-rider regalia. I also liked the dragon when she was a baby! So cute!<br /><br />But overall, this was a limp insipid film, dumbed down for the kiddies.
B00000ITOY|5.0|This toy is a great learning tool.  My 22 mo. old son received it as a Christmas gift and we have enjoyed it together from the start.  He is developing his fine motor coordination by handling and correctly placing the shapes; his ability to identify both shapes and colors; and improving his counting skills.  I'm sure there are other ways to use this toy, too.  It seems to be quite durable and well made as well.  All in all it is a great choice.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|This DVD is everything I expected. A beautiful person, a beautiful voice and a beautiful setting. I will enjoy this DVD for years to come.
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin<br /><br />12/1/2007<br /><br />And in case you're still having second thoughts...<br /><br />The Song of Ice and Fire series is one of the most brilliant fantasy series ever - with its multilayered plot, diverse range of complex personalities, intricate background history, wealth of details, animated conversations, great action & political intrigue - all described profusely in the other reviews. In case you're still vaciliating on whether to buy the book or not, I'd like to bring up one factor that hasn't been discussed a lot:  the use of humour in the series.<br /><br />SoIF is probably one of the series in epic fantasy with a large amount of funny lines, sarcasm and satire. Of course, it wouldn't compare to the famous science-fiction comedies such as Douglas Adams \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" or Terry Pratchett's \\"Discword\\" series. But those books ride on hilarity and lunacy, while the SoIF is based on a darker sense of humour - as dark as the plot itself, and just as addicting.<br /><br />Most of the humour stems from the engrossing characters that Martin had developed. In A Game of Thrones, it is Tyrion Lannister the cynical dwarf that steals the show with his wit and sarcasm, insolence and compassion, courage and vulnerability, arrogance and self-depreciating humour. Though he is the son of a tyrant and the brother of a power-hungry queen and arrogant Kingslayer, Tyrion receives little respect due to his deformity. So he lives by his wits and his sharp tongue. He gets most of the funny scenes and iconoclastic one-liners, and most readers love him. Apart from Tyrion, other characters (which we would see more in the series subsequently) such as Arya Stark, Jaime & Cersai Lannister, Dolorous Edd etc also spice up the story with their colourful adventures and witticism.<br /><br />A good quote is worth a thousand explanations. Here are some of the examples of humour in the story (some are more meaningful than funny):<br /><br />Tyrion Lannister:<br /><br />\\"Did I offend you? Sorry. Dwarfs don't have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\\"<br /><br />Lord Petyr Baelish:<br /><br />\\"Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed down off your horse\\"<br /><br />Arya Stark:<br /><br />\\"You have juice on your face, Your Grace\\"<br /><br />Lord Eddard Stark and Lord Petyr Baelish:<br /><br />\\"Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason\\"<br /><br />\\"Only if we lose\\"<br /><br />Bran and his father Lord Eddard Stark:<br /><br />\\"Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?\\"<br /><br />\\"That is the only time  a man can be brave.\\"<br /><br />And, of course, \\"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die\\" - Queen Cersei Lannisterfunny): <br /> <br />Tyrion Lannister: <br />\\"Did I offend you? Sorry. Dwarfs don't have to be tactful.

B000FPX0FW|4.0|I think we'll be seeing and hearing more about this artist.  She has an absolutely beautiful voice, purse and natural, and soulful music and lyrics.  Go to her website and you can hear a clip of \\"Go Put Your Records On.\\"  This is the song that got me hooked.  Definitely worth purchasing.
B0000X61VE|4.0|I have been working out with this video for years and can assure you, you WILL see results very fast by doing this program 2-3 times per week. However, if you are someone with injuries, be aware that you will have to do fewer repetitions, and adjust your form on several of the exercises so as to prevent further injuries to your back, knees, and neck.  <br /> <br />If you have not worked out with a personal trainer or gone through physical therapy to learn proper form for exercising, I would not recommend this video. You must know the limits of your injuries and be willing to make adjustments to Cindy's routine so as to not further your injuries. I very much recommend her standing workout for arms though. It is fantastic and tones you VERY quickly. Cindy is great. The music is upbeat and you don't feel like she is talking down to you. She reminds you to take lots of sips of water, and even more importantly, to breath while exercising. This is important for obvious reasons, but even more so for those of us with back, neck, shoulder, and knee injuries...we tend to hold our breath and push through the pain and that is really harmful! The body needs oxygen to heal those hurting muscles!!!   <br /> <br />Anyway, do buy the video! It's fun, Cindy is enjoyable to watch, and she certainly inspires you to work hard to get a body like hers. Just be careful and go slow at first. Do half of the number of repetitions that Cindy does and work your way up. If any of the exercises cause you immediate pain, DON'T do them. Modify that particular exercise. Instead of doing full-sit ups that strain your lower back, just add an extra set of crunches. It's as simple as that. Modify the routines on the exercises that irritate your injuries and catch up with her on the ones that don't. You CAN do this workout if you have injuries, you just have to listen to your body! Don't push through the pain...just modify your routine and enjoy the results; you will be seeing them rather quickly!
B000GYI32M|5.0|I found the O.C. to be a very entertaining series and season 3 continues the thrilling saga.  Every episode throws in a new twist between the characters with an unexpected end to the season.  Looking forward to the release of season 4.
B000H30B2C|5.0|Naomi is truly drop dead gorgeous!  Even if you do not like Kong or the dinosaurs or the giant bugs or the eerie Skull Island, if you enjoy watching a truly beautiful woman, then this film is for you!  Naomi alone is worth the price of the DVD!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love this movie The Lake House and the soundtrack is fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000HIVO64|5.0|There is no doubt Beck is on a roll.  Each disc he releases is more advanced than the last.  The Information reveals more of itself through multiple listens, but the first 6 tracks hit hard.  It's hard to argue with the quality of these songs, and the instrumentation is first rate.  You won't be dissapointed.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|My wife and I have seen Michael Buble in concert before.  His live performances are even better than the studio albums.  To really appreciate <br />his talents and sense of humor I highly recommend this Dvd/CD.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|This DVD is full of scientific knowledge regarding the degradation of our planet.  However, the intertwinings of Al Gore's life with the important environmental information seems to muddy the good intentions of Mr. Gore's passionate pleas.  I do appreciate his delivery of this message to America and the world.  We all do not want to admit these truths exist.  The idea that this is a MORAL issue needs to be taken up by all political persuasions.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I saw this movie over 8 times. This is a very good movie.

0618680004|5.0|When Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and other myriad religions will get together and say that there is one God and one set of teachings that they agree on, religion may be worth another look. As it stands now, God, if there is one, cannot be but ashamed of how s/he is perceived and what is done in the name of God. Dawkins does a good job of focusing on a higher level of understanding we must have of the nature and the universe. We should marvel at what we've learned through discipline scientific quest instead of arguing whether there will be another Messiah. For those who believe in God, science is a much better path to knowledge of the creator than your local priest or the so called holy books. Indeed the priests of today often pick and choose from scientific discoveries to substantiate the belief in God. Why not just go to the source directly and decide for yourself. A must read.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|Brilliant. This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and the teaming up of Jeff Bridges and John Goodman was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br />In TBL, you can see echoes of Jeff's Jack Lucas character from the Bridges/Williams classic The Fisher King, but here, Jeff is playing it strictly for laughs. <br /> <br />No shortage of the eff word in here folks, so unless your granny is a tattooed biker chick, I'd suggest it ain't a good, solid movie for all the family. Good solid entertainment in every other way, though. <br /> <br />One of the best Jeff Bridges movies out there.
B000008GS9|3.0|First, let me say I love BI and his band with Steve Stevens, what a great combo and music they could create, studio or live.  The album is keeping in form with earlier releases, basically where you have 3-5 tracks on the whole affair worth listening to.  But, REALLY worth listening to.  The only hit was Rock The Cradle, but hits aren't always it.... I put my chips on Prodigal Blues!  Anyway, with RTC amongst the tracks, this was supposedly a comeback album for Billy Idol, and it sold well, unlike the preceding disc from 4 years prior (1986), Whiplash Smile, which was wrongly considered a disappointment, when in fact, IMHO, it is his best work ever!!!  Buy it, but buy this disc as well for the few tunes really worth listening to, since, after all, it's available for one cent used.

0375758992|5.0|This book was given to me by a friend. I have read it over and over since then. <br /> Maybe its because I was born in Zambia, moved to Rhodesia as a three year old to the same town were I grew up, and attended the same school as Alexandra Fuller, but I think not, rather its because it shines. <br /> As an author this book released me from the need to write about my childhood, I felt I could not do it any better. The places, the people the sounds and smells are the Africa of my childhood and hers,This is writing of such fierce brilliance it can only come from actually living. <br />I feared that in the hands of some it would be as pearls before swine, yet I see it has already risen to the place it deserves.
0763621803|5.0|My daughter LOVES Charlie and Lola.  These books are great.  If you are familiar with the tv show, each episode is based on a book by Lauren Child and addresses some issue with Charlie's little sister Lola and how Charlie deals with having a little sister who can be quite a handful.  Lola is funny and Charlie is sweet.  This book is about Lola's being a \\"fussy eater\\" and how Charlie gets her to eat foods she says she doesn't like.  The illustrations are an unusual mix of the author's illustrations and patterns from fabrics.  Some of the wording may be new due to the fact that they are written by a British author, but all in all, we LOVE these books.  Lola for president - my daughter reads these over and over again and quotes Lola all the time - accent included! ;)
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I heard some of this C.d. while in Prague for Christmas in our little hotel on Christmas morning, it moved me to tears. <br />I searched in vain for it at the local shops,and in all the usual places once I returned home to Como Italy, my home. No luck. <br />So I ordered it from Amazon on the 30th and it arrived today! Three weeks after Christmas, but so worth the wait. Once again just those first notes of her angel voice singing  \\"So this is Christmas\\" moved me to tears. The songs are a mixture of religious and commercial songs for Christmas, yet so touching and meaningful. The arrangements and way she approaches the songs make it special and I will be listening to it for quite a while, confident in the fact that next Christmas I can take it out again and some <br />one will be moved as I was, and say ... wow how beautiful! Bravo Sarah!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|There are so many reviews praising this work; not just as part of the \\"comeback\\" triology that started with Time Out Of Mind, but for its own sake, standing against anything Dylan has produced.<br /><br />I will keep this short and to the point:  This work is as good, if not better, than anything Dylan has ever produced!  Put on a good pair of headphones and listen to \\"Working Man Blues #2\\" and see if you agree with me that this is the most beautiful singing---the most convincing singing that you have ever heard...not just from Dylan, but from anyone.  Go out and purchase the poetry of Henry Timrod (it is selling well since this album was released) from the 1860's.  Read the beauty that Dylan reads.  Pick up the entire collection of Bing Crosby's releases (it comes in a wonderful box set) and compare....hear what Dylan lifted from him.<br /><br />In this album, his voice is majestic, victorious, beat down, risen again, and so very convincing.  I could write about it forever.....it is his crowning masterpiece.  It is humorous, dark, light, fun, frightening, but so committed to the reality that is life.  For more of my thoughts on this album, as well as a review of a wonderful concert he gave in November, you can check out my comments on my blog:  [...]<br /><br />I even caught a picture of him!  It was funny at the show...the police were supposed to be there to confiscate cameras and recorders.....they were taking cell phone pictures and sending them to their wives and kids!  It was a wonderful show where he played a number of these new songs.  It was amazing to watch how many young people could sing along to  his old songs as well as these.  Even my 6 year old loves \\"Working Man Blues #2\\".  She, as well as her 21 year old brother both share a love of Dylan.  Not since \\"Blood on the Tapes:  New York Sessions\\"  and \\"The Genuine Basement Tapes\\" (1967) has so much emotion been put to audio, though \\"Pressin' On\\" came close.<br /><br />Treasure this masterpiece!  It is timeless.e!  It is timeless.

0385751060|4.0|In his Author's Note, John Boyne writes of his fourth novel, THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS: \\"the issue of writing about the Holocaust is, of course, a contentious matter, and any novelist who explores it had better be sure about his or her intentions before setting out...it's the responsibility of the writer to uncover as much emotional truth within that desperate landscape as he possibly can.\\" Given this fairly strong sentiment, Boyne has written a definitive novel about this much-explored --- though often not explored well --- subject, but his approach is one that might be considered controversial, and rightfully so. A book billed as a \\"fable\\" about the Holocaust --- especially one narrated by the son of a prominent Nazi leader --- is bound to ruffle a few readers' feathers, especially those of the older generations. <br /> <br />THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS opens as nine-year-old Bruno comes home from school to find that he is moving. Following his parents' dinner with \\"the Fury\\" (i.e. the Fuhrer) wherein the Fury tells Bruno's father that he \\"[has] big things in mind for him,\\" Bruno and his family gather up their belongings from their five-story house in the heart of Berlin and move to \\"Out-With\\" (i.e. Auschwitz) in Poland where Bruno's father is called \\"Commandant\\" by everyone around him. Bruno hates his new desolate surroundings compared to the opulent comfort he is used to and wants to return to Berlin immediately. Of course, this doesn't happen. <br /> <br />As the plot progresses, Bruno slowly gets used to his environment. Before long, he becomes bored with his indoor trappings and decides to go exploring along the barrier that separates his family from the hordes of \\"neighbors\\" on the other side of the fence. He is curious about the \\"hundreds of people in the distance going about their business...wearing the same clothes as each other: a pair of grey striped pajamas with a grey striped cap on their heads.\\" On one of his jaunts, he befriends a boy his age named Shmuel and visits him daily, often sneaking leftover food for him from the kitchen. It turns out that he and Shmuel were both born on the same day and the two become quite close from the commonality. <br /> <br />(As far as what happens to Bruno and Shmuel...to give away the ending would be to spoil the impact of the book and whatever gnawing gut reaction is bound to follow its conclusion. This is truly a climax worth waiting for and one that shouldn't be spoiled for the sake of a review.) <br /> <br />What makes THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS different from just any old friendship-in-the-midst-of-tragedy story is that Bruno and Shmuel are from two glaringly dissimilar backgrounds and are living two disparate lives in close proximity to each other, yet they consider themselves equals. What makes it different from many (if not all) other Holocaust stories is that it's told through the eyes of a German boy --- the son of the man put in charge of Auschwitz by Hitler, no less --- who has absolutely no idea what's going on. Bruno is blissfully unaware of the atrocities taking place around him and nothing --- not even what he sees with his own eyes --- seems to alter his seemingly permanent naiveté. <br /> <br />THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is a bundle of fascinating conjectures, questions and contradictions, many of which beg to be examined and will surely ignite any number of heated conversations about the nature of reality, perspective, prejudice and more. John Boyne is a masterful storyteller who, through the eyes of Bruno, has attempted to tackle and put forth his version of one of the most heinous periods in human history. It remains to be seen where readers' opinions about the novel will fall, but this nonetheless is a worthwhile and profound journey that most should take to find out. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling
B00003CXI1|5.0|I love all the mystery and wonder of the FIRST YEAR at Hogwart's, all the introductions of the characters in this new world, and seeing Harry's reactions to the magic he can do! After all the films (so far up to the Order of the Phoenix) this one is STILL my favorite! Wonderful!

078322737X|5.0|First, a commentor has erronously stated that Happy Days owes its inspiration to American Graffiti when actually the pilot with Ron Howard was shot in 1971 (and eventually shown as a Love American Style episode in  1972) then shelved by Garry Marshall. It is said that Lucas even asked to look at the footage to ascertain whether Howard would be suitable as Steve Bolander. Of course excitement for the project was reivigorated by the success of American Graffiti, but in no way owes inspiration to it. <br /> <br />As for the movie, it is nearly perfect. Even though it is a half-generation before my own, it still evokes a sense of nostalgia. There is an ache in the soul when one contemplates having been on the cusp of change, losing something special, and knowing that the best days have slipped into the past. This movie captures this concept magnificently.  <br /> <br />The acting is superior, the editing great, the direction pitch perfect (why Star Wars I-VI are inhabited by wooden cut-outs is a mystery to me). The movie doesn't overstay its welcome and at almost 2 hours it flies by, and if anything seems too short, not that the characters are underdeveloped, you just want to see more of what is soon to be a memory. The movie is a treat and you just want it to be even bigger. <br /> <br />It's nice on a another level as it has Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfus before they became RON HOWARD and RICHARD DREYFUS. With relative unknowns the performances are generally free from pretensions.  <br /> <br />All around a must see movie and in my top 10.

B00005JP9V|5.0|At twelve o'clock (in SF) on weekdays an interview program comes on PBS called \\"The Charlie Rose Show.\\"  A couple days before Christmas, three Mexican directors were on the show: Alfonso Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Guillermo del Toro.  Mostly they talked about their friendship and how they sometimes collaborate on each others' films, and they also talked about their newest films; \\"Babel\\" (Iñárritu), \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" (Del Toro), and \\"Children of Men\\" (Cuarón).  The latter film interested me the most from the clips that were showcased and what Cuarón said about the film.  The most intriguing thing he mentioned was that he preferred not to do close-ups to create the drama, but that he liked to back off and let the actors make their own, real drama, instead of having to synthesize it.     Subsequently I went to see \\"Children of Men,\\" right before school reconvened, and not only does Cuarón accomplish that, but he manages to make everything seem as though it is actually happening, that you are looking though a screen into a real world.  Everything that happens fits into that world and expands its realm beyond the plot line.  Part of how he accomplishes that is the details that Cuarón inserts, such as cynical comments graffitied on walls, and advertising for a commercial suicide drink called \\"Quietus\\" accompanied with the slogan \\"You decide when it's time.\\"  Another impressive aspect of this movie, for not many directors are able to do this well, is the cinematography.  Cuarón pulls off myriad styles of shooting such as steady-cam shots, scenes where the camera is off-center, hand-held camera work, and an incredible nine minute shot with no cuts, that maintains the suspense of the shot masterfully.     One of the best scenes is the opening scene which is brilliantly done, for Cuarón establishes the setting and the tone of the movie within the first minute.  It starts out with a blank screen and a voice announcing the death of the world's youngestperson, aged 18, for no one has been born since 2009 due to the infertility of all women in the world.  Then suddenly an image appears of a crowded coffee shop with everyone looking up at a television, which bears the sad tidings.  You then see Theo (Clive Owen) enter the coffee shop and start pushing through the crowd to order a coffee.  He momentarily looks up at the screen, then takes his coffee and walks outside, with a subtitle at the bottom of the screen proclaiming the date to be November 2027 in London.  He walks down the street a little and stops to put some alcohol in his coffee as the camera circles around him, when the coffee shop he was just in explodes, and a woman walks out holding her severed arm right before the screen turns black, and the title of the film is displayed in bold, white letters.     From that first scene the tone is set, and details begin to be filled in when metro trains are attacked by angry rioters, piles of dead cattle are seen aflame in the countryside, signifying the continuous presence of mad cow disease in England, and cages filled with illegal immigrants can be seen everywhere, even on platforms for the Underground (the British metro rail).  The only escape from the outside world is in Theo's friend Jasper's house, hidden away in the woods off of the highway somewhere in the countryside.  The story progresses as Theo is abducted by an underground group called \\"The Fishes,\\" led now by his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore).  She asks him to obtain transit papers for a girl in exchange for five thousand pounds.  He declines at first, but later decides to do it, and gets the transit papers from his cousin who works for the government.  After that, the situation gets worse and worse as Theo begins to find out the whole truth.     While the movie is extremely enjoyable, the plot obviously isn't pertinent to life nowadays, unlike other sophisticated films, such as \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" (excellent film), and \\"Syriana.\\"  However, the movie manages to address many topics that are relevant to today without obstructing the flow of the film, such as the issues of illegal immigration, cruel and unusual punishment, and to a smaller degree the quality of our food, which has become a bigger issue since the recent outbreaks of e coli poisoning.     Most of the aspects that make this movie good I have mentioned in passing, but what truly makes this movie great is how it all comes together.  Everything; the details, the acting, the special effects, the camera work, all come together and function beautifully in regards to each other.  This is a unifying aspect of all movies that are considered to be masterpieces of film making.  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy would never have been considered a great epic if the acting and the special effects had not been so unified, nor would any of Akira Kurosawa's films have been so wonderful if he had not had such excellent actors and plot lines to work with.  I definitely recommend seeing this movie, for this truly is an example of great film making, and seeing Clive Owen at work is always a pleasure.

0743455967|5.0|I've never seen the point in long reviews, so I will spare the reader and cut to the chase. <br /> <br />This book is about Stephen King's life: the experiences that led up to his car accident and how they, in turn, affected his career as a writer. King writes about himself for about the first half of the book, and it's great. He interjects little pieces of wit and wisdom here and there. Some invaluable (if you like King), some dispensable, but each equally pleasurable. <br /> <br />The latter portion of the book is moreso dedicated to the technique of writing. Or I should say (accord to King, whom I will in no way argue with) not THE technique but A technique. His technique. It is of course quite insightful to see into the mind of a mand who has written so many words. <br /> <br />The last few pages of the book I found immensely interesting. There are (roughly) 10 pages of a 'first draft' from one of King's stories (the name eludes me), followed by corrections to this draft and reasons for those corrects. Indespensable insight, if you're attempting to look into King's 'writer's mind'.  <br /> <br />Great book. You get what you buy. Wanna know about King, life as well as work? Then get it.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Caveat emptor - but in this case take care which reviews you heed. Most of these are filled with vitriol accusing Lucas & Co of releasing a substandard, non-anamorphic, poor quality DVD. I got this tonight and on MY Panasonic plasma HDTV with a Philips 726 DVD player correctly set to 16:9 format input and progressive scan, and using component video cables, it fully fills the screen at 2.35:1 aspect ratio and looks fabulous. All I can surmise is that either 1) some folks have it in for Lucas re-working the original films to such an extent that even when he releases the originals they can't let it go, and/or 2) these folks don't know how to properly configure their TVs and DVD players for movie viewing. Don't listen to these idiots, there is nothing wrong with this DVD set.

Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars only because you can see that this disc is experimental in some ways and with any disc that realy pushes new boundaries you are going to get some not so good but with these kind of discs the good is really good.  Often the beauty in experimental discs is the contrast that makes the good really good.  To me one of the best bands at contrast were the Melvins but that does not mean I am comparing De-Loused to the Melvins.  I would more describe De-Loused as a modern Yes with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but De-loused is so much more.  Highly recommended intelligent, rock and roll.

So you can be lazy driving around in your car, eating your high fat foods and sit and watch Friends all day. We live in an over producing world and we need to realize that. I mean, do you really actually need to have all that worthless stuff just hanging around your house? Does your dog really need a sweater? Does your kid really need so many toys when they should be using their imagination and playing outside?<br /><br />This is a movie everyone should see, even though it does make humans look bad, but unfortunately it is the honest truth! I know I am not perfect, and I have contributed my fair share to ruining the planet, but at least I am conscious about that fact and try to make changes in my daily life to stop it.<br /><br />People who do not like this movie are just upset that they are being forced to realize that they are doing something wrong. They are also unwilling to change and to actually care about something besides themselves!<br /><br />Besides all that, it is really adorable and funny as well :)

B00003CXTG|1.0|This would have to rank as one of the worst movies of all time. Overlong, boring, dreadful acting, embarrassing  screenplay. By the time you get to the battle sequence (meant to be the movie's centrepiece) you're so bored that you don't care what happens to any of the main characters. In fact, you end up hoping all the main characters die quickly so this pathetic movie will end. But I did find it very funny to listen to the dreadful dialogue, so at least I got some amusement from it. <br /> <br />I actually found the battle scenes quite disrespectful to the memory of the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor. Scenes of people dying horribly using modern-cinema realism and gore was quite repulsive and offensive. I'm surprise Michael Bay was allowed to get away with it. As I watched the gore-fest that is the battle, I wondered what those people who died that day would think of the way their deaths were portrayed - like some ghoulish freakshow for us 60 years later to watch and say with a morbid smile on our face ... Oooooo ... ahhh ... yuck. It would have been much better if Bay had gone down the tasteful, respectful path rather than the shock, showman route. <br /> <br />My favourite cringe-worthy lines - <br /> <br />Alec Baldwin as the General (or whatever he was) - The heart of a volunteer is the noblest of all. <br /> <br />Josh Hartnett, while looking at himself in the mirror wearing his uniform - (Crying) You know, whenever I see mahself in this here uniform .... I just don't feel like a hero. (Cries some more). <br /> <br />Also cringe-worthy is the way the Japanese are portrayed in the movie. Whenever we see Americans, there is beautiful music playing behind images of pretty scenery and lovely, bright colours. Whenever the Japanese are shown, we see dark, grey tones and booming, dark, evil music thumping away. Cut back to Americans ... cue pretty music and bright colours. Talk about manipulate the audience's emotions, rather than Bay making his point in somesubtle way ... like a good script. <br /> <br />How can anyone think this piece of garbage is worth 4 stars? <br /> <br />The soundtrack is incredible though. Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderous. Its a pity his talent and genius was wasted on such trash.

1573223085|3.0|I like the evolutionary premise of this book; however, the case is half baked. The value of information brokers does seem to be reducing or is it just finding a new, more distributed level? Communications networks have made information globally available to everyone. It seems reasonable that the new value is using this information creatively. But, the author does not make a convincing case.

0380789035|4.0|The premise of this book is fantastic - that all the gods of America's immigrants have come to America with them and exist here (or are dying here) as people in the world, reliant on their believers for purpose. Be it Norse gods who came over with the Viking raiders or African deities bought with the slaves, each exists in a semi-immortal state, though many are sickened by lack of believe - not in a corny Santa Clause movie way, but in a gritty, dark, humorous world populated with striking characters and hidden motives. And these gods are at war.<br /><br />In the middle of it all is Shadow, an ex-con just trying to get through the day, who makes his way cross-country by the mercy of one of these American Gods and his dead wife. Shadow is a simple, straight forward, been-wronged type guy that you end up feeling very attached to ... you actually see yourself moving forward with him in the story, and can't help but hope and pray it turns out all right for him.<br /><br />This creative idea combined with excellent writing makes a real page turner - I pushed through the entire 600+ page book as fast as possible, desperate to know who Shadow would meet next and how it would all turn out. So why not 5 stars? The ending was little lackluster and Shadow was saved a few too many times by some contrivance - but please don't let that stop you from reading it - American Gods is well worth your time.

B000K4WPCC|4.0|This movie kept my interest. I wish it would've been scarier, but it did unfold the story in an interesting way. I like movies where young people discover they have some power or gift and the story tells of how each character responds to that power. <br /> <br />Steven Strait was very good in the movie. His character was an important part of the film and he needed to be strong and likeable in the role - and he was. I do wish the trailers and ads had not given away info on the villian in the movie.

0375505091|5.0|This photo narrative unfolds like a novel, and even though you know in general how it ends, with Ms. Sontag's illness and death and with the passing of the photographer's father, the complex characters, evocative settings and rivetting plot line keep pulling you through.  This book is richly moving.  It changed my life, like watching Ingmar Bergman's \\"The Seventh Seal\\" did once upon a time or reading Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH for the first time. <br /> <br />Ms. Leibovitz draws amply from her personal life, but the experience of \\"reading\\" this book rapidly transcends the personal and becomes something much more intimately universal for us all.  You don't stand outside this experience.  You don't turn the pages and think, Oh, that's Susan Sontag, the intellectual.  You peer insted at the face of the Beloved as seen by one who understands her beauty, vulnerability and many dimensions. <br /> <br />An emotional undercurrent links the studio work to the personal photos and bridges whatever absurd gap might seem to exist between the two.  Any given day for Ms. Leibovitz could have involved shooting photos of Michael Jordan or R2-D2 or Martina Navratilova in the studio--and then during her \\"down\\" time that night snapping candids of Ms. Sontag at home.  You don't sit there dwelling on this.  You take it in stride. <br /> <br />The radiance of motherhood is such an obvious joy for Ms. Leibovitz.  I don't think this narrative, this \\"life\\", could have been complete without it.  Motherhood stands as a buoyant and spirit-soaring counterpoint to the more elegiac and gothic aspects of her time with Ms. Sontag. <br /> <br />We all experience heart-wrenching sadness in life, right alongisde moments of pure bliss, but not all of us can make something beautiful out of it.  In this chronicle Ms. Leibovitz does the work for us.  It's quite a gift.

B000063DFN|5.0|Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" is still among the best of epic metal that one can find, even after all this time since its initial release. With each track being a mini-story in its own right, \\"Powerslave\\" is some of the best from a band who had inspired dozens of others.<br /><br />While the album overall is excellent, I have to agree with another reviewer that the better songs are at the beginning and end. \\"Aces High\\", \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" are all my own personal favourites. The latter weighs in at a massive 13 minutes or so, and is own a scale that is truly epic.<br /><br />Excellent rhythms and percussion make a solid foundation to the songs and what you end up with is simply great metal that tells great stories. Iron Maiden are rightly gods in this genre.
B00030590I|4.0|Words cannot capture, and neither can a television - the visually stunning nature of this film.  I am so glad I saw it in the theater before buying it on DVD.  I have a 35\\" television with a pretty nice surround sound set-up, and it just doesn't cut it.  The big screen is absolutely the only way to fully experience this movie.
B000063DHL|5.0|\\"Somewhere in Time\\" marked a slight change in style and feel in Iron Maiden that they have not repeated to my own knowledge. This offering from the band maintains their previous epic metal songs, each one a tale. They went with a more \\"new wave\\" metal feel, but didn't completely saturate the CD in it. Fans can still recognise the trusted Maiden hallmarks, but with some added flavour to spice things up.<br /><br />This is one of my all time favourite Maiden CD's, especially...well, hell, I like them all, pretty much. It is hard to choose what I like better. \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" makes an excellent kick start to what is a fantastic journey through some lively, thumping and awesome metal.<br /><br />Being into running, I really enjoyed the song \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\". Only Maiden could take something so mundane and make it sound so cool. \\"Alexander the Great\\" is also a fantastic song, with some great music work and tight vocals.<br /><br />Although a slightly different feel to Iron Maiden's usual, \\"Somewhere in Time\\" is something every fan should have in their collection. You are missing something special if you haven't got it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|One of the best love movies I have ever seen. If you like romance movies you'll love Persuasion. It goes along well with the book, too.
B000065BPB|5.0|I had a pair of Fostex T-20RPs that had served me well since around 2000.  I'm a DJ and I would've bought another pair or the T-40RP or T-50's, but my assistant recommended these to me and I couldn't be happier.  The first time I put them on to use to play games like Call Of Duty on my computer my brother had tried to get my attention 3 times (the last time he yelled) in order to let me know that I couldn't hear him...and I didn't even have the volume all the way up.  The closed-cup design isolated almost all exterior noise.  Plus I noticed I was hearing sounds in-game that I didn't hear before and it made for more enjoyable gameplay since I was basing location of enemies on sound alone.  I have studio monitors for my computer setup (M-Audio BX5's) and I thought I heard a lot w/ those.  But the bass was on these headphones was very revealing without distortion as was the highs.  On the road I haven't been disappointed yet.  It has helped me make better mixes and I even also use these for audio editing on my computer on some days instead of just the regular speakers to hear the nuances in the sound.  Very happy with these and would probably buy an extra pair just for home if I had extra money.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I'm a lifelong Beatles fan and I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Love.\\"  The sound quality is awesome; Giles and George Martin did a great job.  I've been listening over and over -- and can't wait to see the Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This man is raised in the hills of Tn. At first he is a hell raiser and likes to fight all the time, then one night on his way home (drunk) in a rain storm he gets or his rifle gets hit by lighting and he come to by a church and then get saved and then ww1 starts up and he don't want to go in because fighting and killing is against his religon but the preacher tells him he has to go in but he sayes he won't fight but he does just to saves lives and goes home a hero.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar outdid themselves.  DVD has great bonus feature including virtual fishtanks.
0143036556|5.0|A great insight into past societies, bringing together strands of research done by different professions over the ages. A good follow up to Guns, Germs & Steel.
6305784116|4.0|Better story than Jungle Book.  Better music.  Some things are red flags to parents today (A goose gets drunk, and several characters smoke.)  But it's still better than Jungle Book in my opinion, a tighter story, with more charming characters.  Scatman Caruthers (sp?) does a great job.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I very much enjoyed this set about the Beatles because it gave an intimate account into the personalities of the fab 4.  Especially enjoyed the early years.  I learned to play guitar when the Beatles came out and when I was good enough to play in a garage band...we played alot of  Beatle tunes...their music was instumental in my learning to play better...I think this set is great for anyone who remembers and loves the music they gave.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Great Animation, Great Story, Great Voice Actors - I think both adults and older teens will enjoy it.
078322737X|5.0|If you were a teenager in the '60's you will relive the best of those years watching this movie.  The music is great. I don't know if you can wear out a dvd but I'll probably find out considering how often I play this one. Film critics say this is one of the all time best movies and they are right.  Buy the sound track cd too.
B000068OCS|2.0|Baraka was so much better and after I watched the interview at the end ...Holy Cow, what a self important $@!!#%  (You fill in the rest.)
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I played this dvd for my kids and grandchildren when they were here for the holidays and they agreed that it was beautiful.  The ladies are lovely and the music is amazing.  Can't wait to get the one done at Slane Castle.  I saw both performances on PBS and was so glad to be able to buy them at Amazon.Com.
B000002UJQ|5.0|After hearing comparisons to Muse, Coldplay, and Blur; I decided to give these guys a try.  I purchased Kid A and Amnesiac first and was impressed with the atmospheric Floydian style of the band.  But that didn't prepare for this album.  Needless to say, when I put this in the Cd player, I was blown away.  Paranoid Android just floored me with the constant shifting of meter and dynamics, very much like the old prog stuff with a alt edge to it.  It seems that the British bands have the upper hand when it comes to producing good melodic and interesting music (some American bands like My Chemical Romance, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Killers are also incredible bands).  This is a definite must buy!!!
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Let me start by saying have been a big Def Leppard fan for almost 25 years! With that said this new 2-CD Deluxe version of Hysteria sounds awesome! I compared the sound to my original 1987 version which has been played hundreds of times through the years. I did a track by track sound test and every tracked off the new Digitally remastered CD sounds much louder, fuller, and more enhanced than the 1987 version. <br /> <br />As for the bonus CD goes, the live stuff is pretty cool and the original recordings of \\"Tear it Down\\" and \\"Ring of Fire are cool too, being I had them as B-sides to Hysteria 45's (yes I'm that old LOL) those songs were later included on the Retro-active CD released in 1993 but were given some added guitar work and updated production which are not present on this current Deluxe version! <br /> <br />If your big fan then this is a must have, or if you just worn out or lost your old copy and want to replace with a fuller, richer sound the try to get this one! I never reviewed any thing on Amazon before so I hope this helps!
B00009L1UP|5.0|This album as a follow-up to the Epic Operation Mindcrime exceeded expectations.  Geoff Tate's voice is second only to Freddie Mercury for quality and range.  Just listen to the classic Silent Lucidty and you can hear that for yourself. A co-worker of mine, who doesn't like hard rock or metal was blown away by Geoff's voice.  There are many other classics on this album like Jet City Woman and Anybody Listening?.  Well worth getting
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Since the first time I viewed this movie, I was fascinated in a lot of factors, camera, directing, and a little bit of the acting was also very good, though in some scenes it seems like I'm watching Gladiator.<br /><br />A great movie for a great price, a \\"must have\\" item.

0671015206|3.0|This book shows that majority of millionaires are neither flashy or big spenders. The book is based on data and facts, this makes it credible and a little tedious at the same time. However, it is  informative and should you be one of the many who are not millionaires it will be of great help to you. If you are already a millionaire it can only help you. <br /> <br />The focal point of the book is that becoming a millionaire has more to with your lifestyle and financial choices than your education or job. While this might seem to be common sense, the data, as shown in the book, shows that such sense is common among millionaires, but uncommon among everyone else.

0975991477|5.0|The book makes it easy to understand how the cell is constructed and the forces that make it function.  He sheds great light on how it processes information in his comparison to a computer which is controlled by a crystal.  <br />It was enlightening to me to learn that the cell's processing center is also a crystal, a liquid crystal and shares much of it's processing capability with the processor that the computer uses.  It was worth the cost to me.
0380713802|5.0|Someone once said that you can fake intelligence, but you can't fake wit.<br />Maybe that's why there are so many books...but so few funny ones.<br />I for one think the world needs a lot more funny books.<br />I sometimes get sick of reading analytical nonfiction, sick of reading serious descriptive prose, sick of the things I read always demanding something from me, whether its my earnest attention or my logic and reasoning.<br />Sometimes, I just want to read something that will make me laugh.<br />That's when I'm grateful for Bill Bryson.<br />This guy is hilarious.<br />Forget how cranky and irritable his writing makes him seem, forget his biases, forget that the subjects of his books sometimes seem like little more than loose structures built solely to be ornamented by jokes, forget that his book jackets always mention that he's one of Newsweek's celebrated \\"boomers,\\" forget all that.<br />Instead, just read his work, and take careful note at the number of times you have trouble breathing due to how hard you're laughing, at the number of times someone asks you if you're okay because they're not quite sure if you--you with the book over there--are laughing or sobbing, at the number of times you almost wake up the sleeping person next to you with your uncontrollable guffawing.<br />This book has little more going in the way of plot than the loose story of Bill Bryson traveling aimlessly around Europe, but it is funny.  Hilarious.<br />If you have any sense of humor at all, you will laugh at it, I can almost guarantee it.
1932100660|5.0|This book is no doubt the best ever written on nutrition. It helps you to realize what foods are best for human consumption, and WHY we shouldn't consume others. My hat is off to the authors.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Meat Loaf is up to his old tricks again and has unleashed the third and final album in the Bat Out of Hell trilogy. This one is entitled Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster is Loose, you'd think after the Bat II Meat would have just given up. Yeah, he did get a nice hit off that album, but overall it wasn't a worthy follow up to the original Bat Out of Hell record. At this point you'd think Meat and Jim Steinman would avoid going there again. <br />On Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster is Loose; Meat Loaf acquired not only the talent of Mr. Steinman but also hit maker Desmond Child who has worked the likes of Kiss to Rickey Martin. There's also many guests found within and they are strategically placed throughout the album and for the most part it works brilliantly. The songwriting on most of the tracks nothing short of spectacular; \\"The Monster is Loose,\\" this is an epic track penned by Desmond Child, Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx and current Rob Zombie guitarist John5 who laid down a ripping solo on there. It's then followed up by \\"Blind As Bat,\\" this song is example of the extraordinary vocal talent that is Meat Loaf , he is as solid as they come. When Meat sings \\"If I Could Blast into Hell I would,\\" he does so with such passion and emotion that you can't refute. \\"Bad for Good\\" sounds like a Queen inspired Steinman creation and when you're connected you get Brian May from Queen to guest on the track, \\"In The Land of The Pig, The Butcher Is King\\" a spectacularly evil song that features a schizo solo by Steve Vai and then there's \\"If It Ain't Broke Break It,\\" is my hands down favorite on this album. This particular song features pedal steel guitar, but crosses into metal territory at times, the guitar work is provided by Eric Sardinas, who must have soaked his fingers in a bucket of ice water after his take, the man's on fire. If I had to describe \\"If It Ain't Broke Break It\\" I'd have to say that it sounds like Savatage meets Loaf. The record isn't without it's questionablecalls, for example there's the Steinman penned \\"It's All Coming to Me Now,\\" which if you know music was recorded by Celine Dion a number of years back and is god awful. And then there's the last four tracks on the record, which affect the flow of the record tremendously and I find as more or less the obligatory \\"power pop\\" rubbish that bogged down Bat II. It would have been a stronger album with 9 tracks rather than the 14 that made the final product. All in all Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster is Loose is worthy of your attention. <br />By: R. Mosqueda <br />
B000063JDE|5.0|Upon returning to his seemingly quiet and peaceful hometown of Lumberton Jeffrey Beaumont learns in a rather painful sort of way that Lumberton isn't so swell after all. Meet Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper. It is Hopper's character that makes the entire movie. And without giving too much away, Frank is not exactly an outstanding member of the Lumberton community and his actions will certainly gain the viewer's strict attention. Booth and Beaumont together have an unhealthy fascination with lounge singer Dorothy Vallens, played by Isabella Rossellini. In addition to its graphic imagery, the movie's dialogue is phenomenal and even worth mentioning in social gatherings. Even if you, the reader, are not as taken away by David Lynch films (as I am) at least watch 'Blue Velvet' for the interaction and dialogue between Jeffrey and the various elements of the Frank Booth crime syndicate - \\"What's your name neighbor?\\" And please, pay attention to Paul (played by Jack Nance) as well as the lady dancing on the roof of the car to Roy Orbison's 'In Dreams' as Jeffrey receives the beating of a lifetime.
0312330537|5.0|I had mixed and complex feelings (hence my \\"clever\\" title) while I was reading this book. I won't disagree with many of its criticisms - throughout it, I had the distinct feeling that hearing the word combination \\"green eyes\\" again at any point in my life would give me acute arrhythmia, and there were WAY more one-liners than I generally like. But I couldn't put it down. I finished it today, and upon doing so, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Why? The characters were extremely tangible. The events - while at times overwritten - were real. I felt the pain and the pleasure alike. And as rambling as it can sometimes be, it's still one of the best books I've ever read because it made me think a lot more than other books ever have. And in some inexplicable way, it's caused me - already - to look at my own life in a different way than I had before reading. This is why I gave it five stars. For me, the message and the effect are more important than particulars. And in the end, even with the fluff, the writing can still be thoroughly enjoyed.
B000008M54|5.0|this is the album that came after this the sea, the first time i heard fishermans blues, i was expecting something more like this is the sea, but it turn that this was their sgt pepper a true gem , to marry irish folk music with rock & roll is not an easy task ,and mike scott experimenting with all this new sounds wow! true music from the heart
0684843749|5.0|I am a veteran NYC personal trainer and have been lifting weights since, well, since I read this book almost 20 years ago at age 13. It remains to this day one of the best books ever published on resistance training and many ( NOT ALL!!) of the things Arnold did then, I still do with myself and many of my clients. Get this book and keep it forever as a reference source or for inspiration. Arnold was the best of all time and his book is too.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a one of a kind Beatles CD. It is all orginial music put to new generation ways of formating music and whatnot. If you have a chance to see the show at the Mirage in Las Vegas, I highly recomend that too!

B00003CX95|5.0|...which is entertainment.  I do not rely on movies for my factual knowledge of history.  If I want the truth, I'll consult my history books.  Having said that, taken as a film meant to entertain and not educate, \\"Braveheart\\" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson surrounded himself with an amazing cast.  Not enough credit is given to Angus Macfadyen for his portrayal of Robert the Bruce.  He breaks my heart every time I see this movie.  His character has to live in the shades of grey that exist between Wallace and Longshank's extremes and Angus Macfadyen conveys his turmoil in a way that makes it utterly believable.  <br /> <br />Mel Gibson has done an outstanding job at creating an emotionally engaging storyline and bringing it to life.  His entertaining movie encourages people to find out the truth about Wallace and the Scottish fight for independence.  Critics of the lack of accuracy of the movie should give him a break on that score alone. <br /> <br />
1401302378|3.0|It should come as no surprise that the editor of Wired magazine, that bible of all things technological, should be overly enamoured with the significance of the internet, but even so, only someone totally besotted with it, and apparently unaware of the world beyond it, could have written a book like The Long Tail, being as it is informed so deeply by such a utopian (or dystopian, depending on how you look at it) view.<br /><br />Chris Anderson believes the internet has changed the fundamentals of economics, for all places, for all time. He's not the first to think this, of course: legions of young investment bankers, now deceased, made a similar mistake in those first few giddy months of the new millennium before the bubble burst. I can still remember the hubris; the outrageous scepticism which greeted ginger mumblings that things might be in la-la-land. Traditional business models were over. No longer did you need to have anything old fashioned like cashflow, or a business model which might actually render some profit. Well, those young bankers, and their clients, got burned, and even now their successors and survivors shudder at the prospect of making the same mistake. And while Chris Anderson hasn't made that particular mistake, he's made an analogous one: he's assumed that some undeniable developments in that (actually fairly slim) part of the economy that he knows about will necessarily revolutionise the whole caboodle.<br /><br />For Anderson now, just as for those currently redundant young masters of the universe then, we're on the cusp of a brave new world.<br /><br />And, just as they were not, he's not completely wrong, either: There *is* a phenomenon called the long tail (there always has been; the difference is that it's now sometimes economic to venture down it). And it's true, that opportunity it has been created by confluence of technological developments we're beginning to call the digital revolution. It's also true that the internet has radically changed, forever, some business sectors: those that deal in the digital revolution, and in particular \\"intellectual property\\", which has been most profoundly affected by it: publishing; the music and film industries, and the industries surrounding the web itself.<br /><br />But it needs to be kept in perspective. For the rest of the economic world - and for those not dazzled by the e-froth, that's quite a lot of it - it's business as usual. The long tail won't matter a damn. As long as there's a physical good that needs to be manufactured, shipped and warehoused somewhere pending sale, the long tail - which is as there as it ever was, will be just as inaccessible.<br /><br />The point is that the long tail wags only for those artefacts whose main value is intangible - which can be practically separated from the physical \\"thing\\" that contains them. For example: shorn of the intangible intellectual property inside it, the physical manifestation of a book, as an artefact, is (largely but not completely) valueless. A compact disc, as an artefact, is completely valueless. The digital revolution has allowed each of us, as never before, to quickly separate the valuable bit from the physical bit. Being a string of ones and zeroes, and thanks to Moore's Law, the cost of replicating the valuable bit of intellectual property is nil. Once consumers can accept the valuable bit without its \\"thing\\" the supply/demand curve looks very different, since the supply curve starts at an enormous amount, for one unit, then immediately drops to a micron above zero for the second, and flatlines there until infinity. The only limiter is demand. And, though Anderson doesn't think so, demand isn't unlimited. You can only listen to so many CDs, and read so many books.<br /><br />But for trucks, and bricks, and oil, and commodities most of the long tail effect will be muted at best, and unobservable for the most part. Sure: businesses will be able to minimise warehousing costs off the high street,on a more dispersed basis, but it won't do much other than save some marginal costs. Someone still needs to store your oil. Oil isn't a collection of ones and twos. Neither are bricks, nor SUVs, nor - well, most things in the economy. But, this doesn't seem to faze Anderson, who rounds off by saying, apparently without irony, that when the technology of \\"solid state printers\\" (which render three dimensional objects in polymer from computer instructions) develops, no longer will be need to warehouse much at all. I guess we'll just teleport things to our customers. Good Grief.<br /><br />Anderson makes some enticing comments about the inherent shortcomings of intellectual property law given the digital revolution, but then doesn't really follow them to their logical conclusion. It could have been a nice, and ground-breaking, book had he done this, but the opportunity was lost, and this book sits a fairway down the tail of decent Web 2.0/new technology business books floating around at the moment.<br /><br />Curate's egg.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonhigh street, on a more dispersed basis, but it won't do much other than save some marginal costs.

B000I5X81K|3.0|Josh Groban definitely has one the best voices around.  However, I was disappointed in his latest release, Awake.  I didn't think the selections were as good as on his previous CD's.  I really wish  he would stop recording so many songs in other languages and wish he would record an album of classic, familiar songs.  But I sure hope he keeps singing!
0743556003|2.0|As a true fan of Stephen King I look forward to every new publication.  I think he he truly one of the greatest writers of all time, but this story was really slow and boring.  Instead of reading the book I listened to the audio version on CD.  I was not impressed with Mare Willingham's reading (I kept visualizing Ms. Willingham instead of Lisey telling the story).  King can write stories that are both endearing and chilling...this was neither.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Another great cd from the wonderful voice of Josh Groban. I love his voice and I applaud his decision not to conform to what everyone else sings. He knows what he likes and he sticks with it. His voice is just terrific and I look forward to his next cd.

0321344758|5.0|This is a good book for the new web designer. If you are an advanced user looking to expand your knowledge of useability, etc., then this book may be less than useful. UNLESS...you are a designer with cantankerous clients trying to get you to do something you know is a bad idea. Then you can refer them to this book.<br /><br />This is also a great book for those in Marketing or other departments working with web designers. It's a great book for a small business owner working with a web designer for the first time. The information isn't too complex and is laid out very simply...even non-tech folks can find this to be a great resource.
B000055Y0Y|3.0|Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich are at their very bests in this spell-binding and original thriller. Eastwood, in a role not far removed from his \\"Dirty Harry\\", plays a veteran U.S. Secret Service Agent who is constantly haunted by his failure to prevent the assassination of Present Kennedy 30 years ago. However, Eastwood gets a shot at redemption when a mysterious stranger sets his sights on assassinating the current president. John Malkovich is terrific as the killer: a master of deception who thrives on mind-games and doing more psychological than physical harm to our hero. Plenty of twists and surprises, superb acting and a great script makes In The Line of Fire a fine chapter in the legendary career of Clint Eastwood.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Of course this is a chick flick! And it's great.  Kick back and enjoy this romantic movie with your best gal or guy.  It's romantic and charming...that's the best! It's right up there with Sleepless in Seattle, Pretty Woman, etc. We loved it!

6305882592|5.0|Believe me, I'm really not a romantic comedy kinda guy, but I got this for my wife for Christmas and all three of us enjoyed it, including the Theatre Arts Major in our family. It's a tiny bit dated (70's clothes), but it is a timeless story, that is presented off the beaten path. I think even this shoot em up guy would enjoy and see something different in future viewings. Five Stars for great acting, presentation and again, the off the beaten path approach to comedy and love.
0060934913|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I love the way Anthony writes.  I have read some of his other books as well.  I totally relate to his sense of humor.  He has wrecked me on trying to read other books.  I have tried to start reading a few books by other authors, and I just cannot finish them.  Way too boring.  Anthony's style of writing is very entertaining.  I am in no way a \\"foodie\\".  As a matter of fact, I have no clue.  I have never heard of several food items mentioned.  I have a renewed interest in food, though.  Who knew?

B00005JPGM|3.0|\\"In America, it's Bling-bling. Out here it's Bling-bang.\\" One of the more clever lines uttered by Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) when aiming to summarize Sierra Leone's 1999 blood diamond situation to American photojournalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly). Archer is a diamond smuggler who demands your attention when on the screen, but then this feeling quickly dissipates due to a thick Zimbabwean accent that garble lines like a trash compactor. Bowen is the let's-save-the-world type of gal (always looking fresh) who wants proof that diamonds are being used to fund the attempted overthrow of the government by the rebel group Revolutionary United Front (RUF). In the middle of these two is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a fisherman who is being helped by both Archer and Bowen for quite different reasons. <br /> <br />The horror and conflict of Blood Diamond begins immediately during the movie's opening; the RUF invades Vandy's small village and quickly begins to amputate limbs with a machete (RUF's signature tactic throughout the 1991-2002 conflict). Vandy's son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is kidnapped by the RUF to become a child soldier while the rest of the family, except Vandy, manages to flee to safety. Vandy is about to have his arm severed when Captain Poison (David Harewood plays the menace superbly) sees the towering man of muscle as a perfect candidate to mine the diamond fields. <br /> <br />Vandy finds a clear 100-carat pink diamond. He manages to bury it, but not without the ever watchful eye (bad pun for those who saw the movie) of the Captain lurking nearby. Cue the government forces to ambush the RUF and their mine; hence the pink diamond is still buried while Vandy and Captain are run off to prison. And lookie here, guess who is also in the same prison for trying to smuggle diamonds from Sierra Leone to Liberia? Yep, Mr. Archer, who also happens to overhear a loud argument between the Captain and Vandy about the rare gem. So the race is on. The Captainwants the pink diamond, so does Archer, but so does a South African group that Archer has worked for in the past. Vandy just wants to reunite his family while Bowen wants to write the story that will illustrate diamonds being sold aboard may have blood on them. <br /> <br />There are three problems with this film: dialog, dialog, and dialog. All the stars are actually quite emotive despite their lines; Djimon Hounsou has the least amount of lines and sparkles the most on the screen. The cinematography is often stunning, especially the long shots that claim to be Sierra Leone's countryside. The action scenes, although overdone at times to the point of trivializing the true bloody story of Sierra Leone's civil war, are captivating. However, the viewer is constantly yanked back to the reality of watching a movie instead of being immersed within the picture due to the movie lines being clunky and cliché. In terms of the plot, there are not many surprises. In fact, the surprise is how many coincidences do occur in order for the plot line to move forward (deus ex machina in hyper-drive). For example, Vandy reaches the refugee camp (about a million people) and immediately spots his daughter and wife walking behind the fence. <br /> <br />Hollywood should be applauded for a film that spotlights the issues surrounding a conflict diamond, but Blood Diamond is more of a long infomercial or boring political speech than what it could have been: an informative but entertaining flick about an ugly period of history. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot <br />
B0002IQEHI|5.0|There is nothing better than vintage Hitchcock with Cary Grant.  His comic timing and delivery is absolutely the best.  Hitchcock's style is classic.  We love this movie

B000002U94|5.0|This album is by far one of the best albums ever concocted by someone in my generation...Bob Seger's as classic as they come, I'd recommend this album to my children, grandchildren etc...It's good to see him back in performance live mode, and hopefully this tour won't be his last...Brando Quin, author of \\"The Master Painter\\"
B000H0MKGK|5.0|If this won \\"Album of the Year\\" (over the Dixie Chicks) at the Grammys this year I would be surprised but not surprised. The reason being that this is an incredible album. The first three tracks are phenomenal with some of the best production I've recently heard. The album also makes good use of a soul and blues sound infused with the pop leanings. For a great example of this listen to \\"Vultures\\" and \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\". His last album was good but this one will push his clout in the industry. He has proven to me that he is the best singer/songwriter to come out this decade. He also will be one of the few artists from this decade that I believe will maintain a special thing called \\"longevity\\". Great album!
0634023020|5.0|For all you guitar players who are Miles Davis fans (who isn't?), this is a gold mine. Be forewarned: these arrangements encompass some fairly advanced technique. The arrangements are well done and true to the spirit of the original Miles pieces themselves (IMHO). Both music notation and TAB are provided, with chord names as well. The best part of this book is the CD that comes with it. Jamie Findley plays each track in real time and the recordings are clear and well executed. Songs are in the same order as they are presented in the book. The amount of effort that Mr. Lindley put into this is apparent and definitely paid off. This work succeeds on several levels: as a guitar technique learning tool, as a Miles learning tool and as a theory tool. Exceptionally well done. Buy it and you will not regret it. Maybe someday Mr. Lindley will do Coltrane's \\"Love Supreme\\"??

It also teaches internet anime, and he has done some really nice graphics online since getting this book. I highly recommend this.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I admit, just the premise of the LOVE CD made me nervous, but my curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the 2 disc set with CD and audio DVD...and I am glad I did! The hour and a half I spent listening to this amazing melange of Beatles music, seamlessly woven together by the brilliant George Martin, was one of the most mind-blowing musical experiences of my life. <br />      I agree with previous posts saying that this is not for the faint-of-heart, nor is it for the light-hearted Beatles fan...but serious fans will truly appreciate the brilliance of LOVE. One could describe it as a \\"magical mystery tour\\" through the Beatles catalog, although for me, it was a scavenger hunt; I poured over each track, trying to figure out exactly what had been done, and remember where each chord, each note, each line, had been in it's previous life...I discover something new every time I listen. <br />      It you LOVE the beatles, get this CD...and listen to it with a loved one who also LOVEs the Beatles...it really will be an amazing experience. <br /> <br />p.s. if you have any sort of decent sound system or surround system,buy the Audid DVD...the sound is so much deeper and richer, it will blow your mind. <br />
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I appreciate the great service and the fact I was able to purchase it.  It had been difficult to locate this DVD.  The product was in perfect condition and the movie is even better than I had remembered.

B000FDECGA|5.0|If you're a fan of marial arts / samurai movies, this movie is a must-see.  It's evident, while watching the story, why this movie so heavily influenced Quentin Tarrantino's Kill Bill series.  Thematically, it's all there: Revenge.  Cool samurai sword fights.  Lots of blood.  Just enough plot.  Since purchasing this DVD, I've introduced several people to it, and every person found it extremely entertaining.  As with most stories in this genre, the plot is somewhat hokey, and some of the dialouge is comical (although not intentionally so), but the fight scenes are over-the-top, and wonderfully crafted.  The cinematography in this movie is fantastic, as are the picture and sound quality.  Quite simply, if you like these kinds of movies, there is no way you won't like this one.  If you don't, why are you even reading this?
B000K4WPCM|2.0|The Covenant is a watchable movie, especially for the 13-20 age group, but this movie lacks one important thing:  ORIGINALITY.   <br /> <br />The main tagline: From the Producers of Underworld, gave me hope, seeing as the original Underworld is an amazing, beautiful film.  This film fails to deliver, while it's storyline is easy to follow, it just lacks in so many departments.   <br /> <br />The entire movie, all four of the main characters (sons of Ipswich) banter on and on about abusing their powers, and how they will pay consequences for them, but throughout, I did not see a single downside that they so feared.  Not ONCE did the four seem to age like they fear, or expose themselves, or seem to \\"get hooked\\" on using their gifts.  For a plot point that is mentioned as frequent as this, for no pay-off, it seems such a waste. <br /> <br />The casting of this movie seemed typical, and kinda Swimfan-ish, with guys who look alot older than the parts they are playing.  While this is always annoying, the actors at least do get into their roles, and try to make them shine.   <br /> <br />But no matter how much you polish a turd, it just won't shine.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|In Japan,this movie was being introduced as \\"Great One\\". <br />And I saw it,I recognized it. <br />From beginning to the end,I was very excited! <br />And I exclaimed \\"Wow!\\" when MIIKE -Japanese famous movie maker- was on the screen and said \\"You have to spend all your money!\\". <br />In only this point,WE have to watch this!
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is truly a novel of biblical proportions. Set in the Salinas Valley of California, where Steinbeck himself grew up, the story follows two generations of the Trask family, the main one consisting of Adam, his two sons Cal and Aron, and their servant Lee. When reading this epic piece of literature, I found myself immersed in the struggles, triumphs, and emotional battles of the characters, who are so thoroughly developed, I felt somewhat connected to them. There is no doubt that the story claims its grand renown predominantly through Steinbeck's ability to capture every facet of human emotion within his characters. They are intriguing, witty, flawed, unfathomable--the exact qualities that make them stand out as so real. <br />What is also interesting about East of Eden is that it not only parallels the story of Cain and Abel, but it explores it in greater depth, exposing the emotions and thoughts of Cal and Aron. This book is all about relationships--the main one being sibling rivalry, a competition between the sons for the father's love and approval. Steinbeck does the story of Cain and Abel justice through his captivating presentation of the classic tale, showing one son who is seemingly perfect, and the other son who finds it difficult to achieve love. <br />This story contains all the elements of a masterpiece: dramatic plot, round characters, intricate relationships, honest writing, and numerous messages about life. <br />I recommend this book to everyone who is literate.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This is an excellent band, unique music, but a must have cd
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This movie is simply amazing.  It was produced with a fairly low budget but has great, realistic effects.  It also captures the heart of gangsta mentality and the reality of what goes on.  I actually met Cess last night and he's working sequel right now - I can't wait to see the next one.  If you love great independent films, buy this DVD and keep an eye out for Shottas 2!
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Helen leaves her husband for a young man!<br />Agamemnon attacks Troy with a wooden horse!<br />Brad Pitt/Achilles looks buff and acts moody - and gets his heel cut!<br />\\"Troy\\" completely ignores Homer's Iliad!<br /><br />Oy. What a mess of an adaptation. If you even have a passing fancy for Greek Historical Fiction, then \\"Troy\\" will annoy you senseless. Like when Achilles and his cousin are sparring among the ruins? I mean, if it was the present, wouldn't they NOT be in ruins? And what of the fate of Agamemnon (well played by the always dependable Brian Cox)? Did his wife just move up the date for his death and nobody told us?<br /><br />The three-star rating is for the fact that, as epics go, \\"Troy\\" is really stunning to watch. Big Battles! Buff Bodies! Beautiful Ladies! Intrigue! Horses and Ships at Sea! Peter freaking O'Toole! Just forget anything you ever learned about Greek History or the writings of Homer and you'll get a good PopCorn adventure. But if you can't? Don't have any heavy objects that might shatter your TV screen near your lounge chair.
0743529030|5.0|Excellend listening and training for personal development.  Can listen to it in the car or at home and get the motivation for a better future
B00064ADR0|5.0|This album is the greatest re-release ever in the history of rock--period! Not only is the studio (original) portion of Second Winter an absolute gem, the live recording newly added here is even better! This package goes right alongside the Allman Brothers Fillmore East recordings as the greatest blues-driven rock guitar music out there--long overdue! Johnny will blow you away with his smoking guitar chops and soulful singing. And when he starts the intro guitar solo to B.B. King's \\"It's My Own Fault\\", you would swear you were listening to B.B. himself! The rapid-fire licks he throws off during \\"Mama, Talk To Your Daughter\\" are wicked. <br /> <br />A young Edgar Winter joins him onstage for the last half of the concert to show off his own prowess on keyboards, sax, drums, and vocals. Also a talented guy, no doubt. Sometimes his screechy falsetto gets a little old--that's my only gripe on this whole package. But's it's not enough of a blemish to take away from this being the most indispensable release of the past few years! <br /> <br />If you've seen Johnny Winter recently in concert, you know as well as I that he's past his prime, bless him. Well, Second Winter is his prime, for sure, so if you're not too familiar with early recordings of Johnny, you are sorely missing out. Miss out no more, and get this CD package!!!
B00006LWSF|5.0|Another GREAT CD by Eminem, a must have if you like his music.
B0002O37RM|4.0|This is how I describe \\"Land of the Sun\\":<br />Soft, mellow and relaxing, without any musical instruments confusion; every note and every sound from these fine 10 musicians is so well heard and appreciated. The Bongo played by Juan De La Cruz is a beautiful sound addition on every track and the Stereo recording is very well distributed. Charlie Haden is not trying to show what a great player he is; he is simply making a great soft Jazz album full of taste and sweet melodies.<br />Pour yourself a glass of wine, put this album in your CD player and enjoy this beautiful relaxing jazz masterpiece of Charlie Haden. \\"Land of the Sun\\"
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Finally,\\"Superman II\\",the way it was intended,I remember watching the other version and wondering what would Richard Donner have done different,I am happy to say his version is superior,the additional Marlon Brando footage was amazing to say the least it added a warmer father-son relationship.I did not miss the Eiffel tower scene in the least,and I thought this ending was better.
B000GPIPVU|1.0|One song on the whole CD is good.  I didn't like this at all and feel I wasted my money.  I was so disappointed I considered sending it to the record label.  Ray Lamontagne has more talent than he's showing.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is a great CD if you like Marshall Mathers, Slim Shady. I bought it for my teenage son, and my husband also listens to it.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Let's ay it, I am not a fan, far from that, but I always have a pleasure listening to this album, its the equivalent of Floyd \\"Dark side\\" or Genesis \\"Selling...\\" in the band's career. A masterpiece from Jethro Tull. <br />A must have in any serious prog music fan.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|My wife loves this box set.  I find friends to be a good show as well.
0062502182|4.0|Read only if you are interested in your inner life or are in search of the meaning of life. I loved it, but some friends did not.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|If you love Keanu Reeves, or the Matrix, you will love this collection. You will not be dissapointed at all with this.
B00000GAIW|4.0|A classic from this era, I don't like the bonus, I would have put them on a second cd and let the original work on the first cd.  I don't want to hear an interview on an offical classical prog rock album, put it somewhere esle. As another reviewer told, another classic destroyed... <br />In my opinion, Thick as a brick is more consistant and complete, but this is just a matter of taste. No doubt, this one is among the best from the band.  Three classics, Aqualung, Cross-eyed Mary and Locomotive breath.  <br />The acoustic songs (there are many) are good but act more like fillers in order to complete the album, but again, there not bad but surely not in the top composition of the band.
B000002H1T|5.0|The Cars, in a word, are unbelievable.  As popular as they were in their heyday of the '80s, the quality and sophistication of their music remains largely unappreciated.  Heartbeat City is one of the finest albums of the period, and of New Wave as a genre altogether.  It brought together and for the first time to the mainstream, a perfect interaction of rock and electronica, in such an understated way that the very notion passed unnoticed.  The title track itself is emblematic of great soundscape-driven pop/rock, and I don't have enough time to write about all the other tracks in the album.  Suffice it to say that, musically, aesthetically and artistically this was a high watermark for the band and New Wave in the Pop world.  Its follow-up album, Door to Door, was equally good and largely misunderstood, and I would recommend it as much as this one.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Well worth the short wait.  As a bonus, there is another film on one of the disk and many many many extras.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is an outstanding Floyd primer. Truly for fans and newcomers alike  as all the bases and eras are covered. It's nice to see some Barrett-era tunes included, as well as some from the latter-day Gilmour-led Floyd, cuts that are not necessarily classic rock radio favorites. I'm sure most will gripe about this song or that song, what was left off and what was included. And some I see are particular about the editing of the track \\"Echoes\\", but don't worry, only a few sections were very slightly trimmed for time, and chances are you'll be too stoned to even notice. The main draw for me is the inclusion of \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\", which I only ever had on a 7\\" single years ago. The remainder I ( like most fans ) already own. But the continuous mix of the set is rather interesting, and I for one don't mind that the songs aren't presented chronologically. Sort of a fresh coat of paint, a good way to discover ( or rediscover ) some of the best rock music ever created - this one has a permanent place in my cd changer. Very Highly Recommended.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I enjoyed the slight deviation from Josh Groban's normal CD collection by the addition of some more contemporary - yet still styled in his usual audience-pleasing form.  Josh has the voice that all listeners enjoy - from young to old.  I've never recommended one of the Groben CDs to anyone who has not enjoyed them and instantly become a fan.  Get this one to add to your collection!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|My title says it all. This CD is a must for all Beatles fans and those you may want to introduce to the Beatles. Many young people flip out when they hear the Beatles for the first time, like I did in 1963 on the Ed Sullivan Show. But, this is a whole other level of experience. For the true fan you'll enjoy hearing the overlapping of different songs and try to figure out which song that guitar lick is from, or where that drum track came from. What George and Giles Martin have done is a modern day audio miracle. When you sit back and listen to this CD you'll see why the Beatles were, and still are, so important to music. No other band has done what they've done in popular music. The different styles, unique effects, and fantastic vocals made them what they will always be remembered as - the greatest pop-rock band of all time. I can't wait to see the Circ show in Vegas. I know we won't be disappointed. Get this CD now and also give it to your friends. They'll love you for it.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|I enjoyed so much seeing this movie again.  I particularly like that they include statements from the real people involved in the incidents of those times.  NOW IF ONLY THEY WOULD REMASTER IT ON DVD!
0689878451|4.0|The writing is not particularly good, but the message of this true story is one I feel is important:  that same-sex partners can love and be devoted to each other, and form families -- even adopt children.  Warning:  If you are homophobic, this book is not for you.
B00008OLIO|5.0|This album was the beginning of the glam metal scene. Released in 1982 it only sold about 100,000 copies which is actually remarkable considering MTV or radio wouldn't go near it. Motley Crue combined mteal,punk,glam, and pop on this album. Singer Vince Neil never sounds better or more original then this disc. The songs are all catchy(usually under three minutes) and rock hard. Not a simple feat. Most metal bands drone on for 6-8 minuter per song. The album celebrates being young and the recklessness of not having a care in the world. The arenas would be calling on their next disc, but Motley was never better then right here.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|Este concierto es excelente para los fans de este legendario grupo. Presenta la mejor recopilacion de los exitos de muchos años, lo recomiendo ampliamente, tanto la imagen como el sonido es espectacular. No debe faltar en la videoteca de un fans de musica.
076790592X|4.0|My husband was given this book as a gift.  He isn't much of a reader if it isn't work, golf or flying related but this book changed him.  He loved this book.  Yes, he cried but that was OK with him.  It was my husband that insisted I read it, too.  So.... <br /> <br />I found it to be well written, a page turner, gripping, but so darn sad.  I just don't like getting depressed and crying anymore.   <br /> <br />
B00005JPCD|3.0|I agree with so many of the people here; and I have to say that when I read these reviews I just about split a gut.  Of course I was in the theatre with my 70-something year old mother, and I'm turning 50 this year.  So I doubt that the little children who didn't quite understand some of the fun in it--understood that the film was taking up from where their National Teacher's Union teachers left off; the movie depicts human beings as evil 'aliens', and you have an organization with a wreath on its logo which could be easily identified by those of us older than 6-as the United Nations.  Real nice of Hollywood to keep planting these messages about how the United Nations is our savior, and how evil human beings are ruining the ecosystem for cute little fuzzy penguins.<br /><br />The moral of the story could have been that there is a place for all of us in this world, even if we're not all the same, and that we all have God given gifts, that we should be looking for in each other instead of ridiculing those who are different than we are.  They could have left it there, and it would have been a good story with a message, like an Aesop's fable.<br /><br />Instead, in just about every movie that I ever see, there's always some liberal message woven in, which is a real turn off.  I give the movie three stars because the movie and performances are great; but the writers really ought to think twice about sticking their environmentalist hogwash and United Nations one world government kumbaya message into a children's cartoon.  The United Nations is not our savior, and it's dishonest and a lie to represent it that way to children.<br /><br />I'm grown up, my kids are grown, and I'll probably pick it up, but I would have enjoyed it more without them destroying the beauty of a simple message with the crap at the end.
1400082773|4.0|As an Australian living in Brisbane, Queensland,and concerned about this current Bush Administration, I was very interested in learning more about Barack Obama as he appeals to me as a possible leader to drag America out of the current quagmire in Iraq. The book was very enlightening and I intend to read it again. I feel he may have just enough enmity for people of other nations, and may just think less inwardly on foreign policy.

B000E41MS6|5.0|My wife is a steadfast Tom Baker fan.  My daughter felt she could make episodes of Dr. Who in our back yard with a plunger and a garbage can.  But the New 2005 Dr. Who series has hooked them both.  The special effects are comparable to that of a movie directed by that \\"stellar battles\\" director guy. The story lines are excellent.  I plan to by the next season.  I recommend Doctor Who - The Complete First Series by Billie Piper, Christopher Eccleston to Whovians as well as Si-Fi fans.
B00005NRNB|5.0|I LOVE this movie - but I am not sure what difference the \\"Superbit\\" made. It \\"says\\" that it makes the showing of the movie a better experience by utilizing all the disc space but honestly I can't see any difference except for you don't have the pause when it switches layers.
0312263120|2.0|I've got no much knowledge of cryptography, but the end of the story sucks. After they find out the worm is only attacking security layers for entry management, why not just close down the modems or manually remove the cables for outside communication. <br /> <br />Otherwise it's a very nice plot, but covered with Hollywood sugar and not real people.
B0002858YS|5.0|We needed this group to form and make this music. <br /> <br />I haven't gotten this excited about a new band in quite a while. <br /> <br />The Killers are destined to eventually be grouped with music greats like The Smiths, The Cure, REM, U2, Nirvana, and Coldplay in the near future. <br />This debut CD guarantees that! <br /> <br />Very original, fun and catchy - this CD is one of my favorites - I highly recommend it.

0060899190|5.0|It is an interesting American style book. Pretty good gift for my foreign friends.
B000GY729M|5.0|This album is a cohesive concept album.  You might need to give it 2 full listens before deciding what you think.  This is not a CD that can be appreciated by listening to a couple of sound bites/samples. <br /> <br />At first listen I thought it was quite (almost too) dramatic, but after the second listen it started to really grow on me. <br />Now I can't get enough of it. <br />Beautiful, emotional lyrics with a gritty heartfelt delivery. <br />Great music - big, loud, and original.  I appreciated this music even more after seeing many of the songs performed live. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD to rock, pop, alt, and indie fans - you will not be disappointed with this sophomore release...
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is an excellent movie, I can not find the words to describe. I saw this movie several times and I always wanted to get it.

Having always been a \\"meat and potatoes\\" man, this work has convinced me to change my eating plan.
0553801503|4.0|I love the series!  I can hardly wait for the next book!  This is a book that concentrates mostly on the workings of a queen gone mad and how all the various schemes and devices she sets in motion are closing in on...her? <br /> <br />I rather enjoyed the book even though it didn't present me with what is happening with all my favorite characters.  Maybe the next book will surprise me. <br /> <br />Get it...and the rest of the series too!

0061122416|4.0|It seems as though some of the other reviewers of this book focus on the simplicity, and that somehow a book written in a very simplistic manner somehow degrades its overall quality. I respectfully feel these readers have a somewhat myopic view. The simplicity of this book is one of its more appealing factors. I found it to be a very entertaining read, and very well written. I recommend it for a quick, refreshing read.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I really liked this DVD. It completes the whole X-men trilogy. It has the same action and fantastic special effects as the original. I'm glad that I purchased it.
B000HEYVD6|3.0|I had a tough time keeping the characters and names straight in the first few chapters.  The story line was ok - although fairly unbelievable.  I did read it to the end and definitely thought that was a bit foolish.
0895260131|5.0|This book was a great overview of the propaganda put out there by the Democratic and Liberal parties.  It dispells the myths that they would have us believe regarding the crusades and what happened to the \\"poor\\" Muslims.  Muslims hate all Christians and have in the past imposed taxes so high that unless you became a Muslim there was no way to survive.  Not to mention what they did to the Hindus.  This religion is NOT one of peace as the Democrats would have you believe.  This religion is about conquering the world and the Koran tells them that it is ok to lie, cheat, and steal in order to do it.  It is a must read for anyone that wants to know the truth about the Islamic culture and how Muhammad came to be a prophet.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|It's not the fault of amazon.com, but HBO. I'm not complaining about the show, but the quality of these DVD's. I'm in the process of returning my replacement set for a REFUND, not another replacement. Neither the first, nor the second set worked. Don't even waste your time. All of us who purchased the set and then got a replacement should receive a personal apology from HBO because they obviously went that extra mile to show their appreciation for their loving fans...
B000002LKU|4.0|Great old album. One of my favorites for long trips in a car. It reminds me of old country radio when I was young. Any fan of Mark Knopfler should enjoy it.
0553588486|4.0|I have enjoyed the first book in the saga tremendously. There is deep character development and much intrigue in the ineractions of the characters. You will find yourself identifing with one or more of the characters and Despising some of the others.<br /><br />Love, hate, loyalty, ambition, betrayal and deception are all in abundance and heaped up in generous portions.<br /><br />I especially enjoy the authors attention to detail in describing the locations, surroundings and the various raiment worn by the characters. A Hollywood a costume designer would have a field day dressing actors in these coloorful costumes.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|\\"Rear Window\\" comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...<br /><br />Hitchcock demonstrates in \\"Rear Window\\" that he is a great voyeur, that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur, forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...<br /><br />Speaking of technical challenge, \\"Rear Window\\" is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...<br /><br />Hitchcock forces limitations on himself, as he did in \\"Lifeboat\\" when he shot entirely on a restricted set, in only one boat... And in \\"Rope\\" (his first Technicolor film) where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...<br /><br />Having restricted his movements, Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it, and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call \\"pure cinema.\\"<br /><br />Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see close-ups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...<br /><br />Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds, occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...<br /><br />\\"Rear Window\\" describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels, yet hides its own complexity... Stewart, tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her, though he himself does not seem to realize it...<br /><br />All the while, the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives... The tormented middle-aged bachelor, composer/songwriter; the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape; the newlyweds and lovers; the tragic \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers; the hearing-impaired sculptor working day and night; the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer \\"Miss Torso\\" who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and, most important, the hysterical \\"nagging wife\\" - lying in bed - and her grouchy fed-up husband, a jewelry salesman...<br /><br />One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart - in her romantic dinner for two - raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...<br /><br />The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of \\"Rear Window,\\" a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...<br /><br />Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees (or think he sees) what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... His ravishing fianc&eacute;e (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter) warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... But Stewart persists, eventually he was turned on ... This explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... The murderer and his wife became subject of Stewart's parody with the \\"too perfect, too talented, too sophisticated,\\" Grace Kelly...<br /><br />\\"Rear Window\\" is visually very strong... Hitchcock designs the film in such a way so that his view is our view... He manipulates our emotions because he knows perfectly his work... Hehas the film synchronized in his mind... Shooting and editing are, for him, a simple mechanical phase... The creativity has all taken place before...<br /><br />The first shot of \\"Rear Window\\" is a perfect example of this reality - as his many typical first shots - for the way it visually transmits the whole complex to the audience...<br /><br />Hitchcock is a master at using his camera to create suspense... Like Stewart, we are restricted in movements, paralyzed inside the apartment, immobile, trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... There is no way we can warn the outcome... This is what 'suspense' is all about--not surprise... An effect of intense and prolonged expectancy, lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... And, of course, all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...<br /><br />Stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... He was the perfect Hitchcock character: a voyeur by profession, an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...<br /><br />When you see the film, feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you... And don't forget to catch Alfred Hitchcok in his customary cameo appearance, this time repairing a clock... Enjoy!... The creativity has all taken place before...

B0002DB0FO|5.0|This was one of the best Shows on TV and I hate that they took it off the air.  I truly miss it and the people who starred in it.  I hope they will come out with the other Season's for sale as so far only Season One is available.

I'm only on page 58, and already I feel compelled to comment.  A book to be savored, it is delicious. Every carefully crafted sentence is chocolate covered with a cherry inside. Gorgeous. Thank you Ms. Setterfield! You are a conjuror extraordinaire!

B000F3UAFC|5.0|short movie. very understandable and to the point. funny and very interesting. the banter that goes on b/t people in the movie is very entertaining and thought-provoking. provides ample subject matter for a long and interesting discussion b/t viewers. <br /> <br />very nice movie.
B000IOM1RI|1.0|After listening to Tribute, Wonderboy, and Pick of Destiny I was VERY disappointed in the lyrics in the songs on this CD.  Although, I do take responsability and should have previewed the CD instead of assuming (and yes I know what they say about this word) the songs would be as awesome as the three above. I am in the process of returning the CD to Amazon.   <br />I enjoy Jack Black's movies and songs, but now find it hard to stomach anything that he is involved in.  Sorry Jack.

B000H8SFMK|5.0|It's hard to judge between the first three albums the Pogues released as they are all sublime in their own way but this, their slickest and most studio produced album, is a stunner. <br />Every track a winner and the legendary and sorely missed Kirsty McColl duets with Shane MacGowan on the haunting and jaggedly truthful love story \\"Fairytale of New York.\\" <br />Shane Macgowan again shows he is adept at both the hard-driving irish rants and also the heart-breaking ballads like \\"Broad Majestic Shannon\\" and \\"Lullaby of London.\\"

B00000ILDF|4.0|This is one of those movies that many people will find themselves ambivalent to, for many reasons. It helps to view it as an unfinished work. Alien3, in its pre-massacred form, is a deliberately-paced thriller that is set in an environment of religious fundamentalism, and the story behind the story is that Fox essentially took over the movie from newcomer David Fincher and not only refused to allow the man to finish shooting it, but radically re-edited it such that the end product was, to say the least, not compelling. The script for the film went through many incarnations (but never a final one) and, ultimately, when one looks at the special features included on the disc, one wonders how the film was even made at all. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the movie has a strange magnetism to it. Fincher expertly sets up the environment--a mining station/monastery/prison--and does it so effectively that the unbelievability of the premise is hardly even noticed. Essentially, the plot revolves around Ripley crash-landing on a planet on the outskirts of the universe, which used to be a penal colony for violent offenders. The mining operations are over, the company has left and all that remain are a few prisoners who have embraced religion. Ripley has to figure out why she crash-landed, if she has to deal with an Alien again, and whether or not she has another problem altogether. <br /> <br />The movie is, as expected, not without its faults. For one, the title. Alien^3 makes one think there will be three aliens in the movie (spoiler alert: there aren't). It doesn't quite sync up with the previous film, Aliens, and at times it gets a bit too dour (although it is not entirely humorous--it has a few moments of comic relief, and not all of it is black humor). The sequence near the end--in the maze--is not nearly as compelling as it should be and isn't too scary. Also it can be a little difficult to tell apart the characters, as all of them dress the same and are bald, although this problem is mitigated somewhat in the uncut (read: before butchered by Fox) version. <br /> <br />However, the movie is strangely compelling. This is partially due to the performances, which are all pitch-perfect. Sigourney Weaver sheds her hair for this movie, and gets an ending that is lovely and poetic. Charles Dutton really nails the whole \\"evangelical zeal\\" thing, Brian Glover is impressive as the warden, Charles Dance plays a secretive (and secular) doctor. People who say the movie is too dark and nihilistic (probably one of the biggest reasons why people dislike it) obviously did not pay attention, as virtually all the characters--despite their initial impressions--show touches of humanity and nobility (at least, until the company men show up). It's actually a fairly humanistic film, if viewed in that light. Aside from excellent atmosphere (thanks to Fincher) and a few really good twists, it is also notable for creating a society of fundamentalists that is quite believable. It might not add up to much in terms of having a message, but it is still an intense ride. In that sense, it is like its predecessor, although about 180 degrees apart. <br /> <br />Nobody is disputing the movie's flaws. However, one has to ask if an obviously flawed movie can still be a compelling one, and I believe it can. This is a movie that deserves better than it got, and I think that that is possible now, with this much-enhanced version.

B000005RQT|5.0|The 25th anniversary remaster not only has much better sound quality than the old vinyl release, but contains several bonus tracks which were not on the american version of the album, making it the definitive version of this classic record and worth the extra money.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|...when I hear this music, I kind of feel like I'm travelling back in time. I'm not talking about back to the mid 80's when this album came out. I'm talking way back to my childhood in the 60's. This is very elemental music with universally familiar rhythms. I hope Mr. Simon get's another touch of the inspiration that led to this wonderfully refreshing music.

B000FA57NK|4.0|Apollo 13 is my first HD-DVD purchase (well it came free with my HD-E1), and I can say it is a HUGE improvement over DVD, HUGE...but after watching for a good 10mins, i noticed it could have been much better. <br /> <br />PICTURE QUALITY: 7/10 <br /> <br />Picture Quality is AVERAGE all the way up to AMAZING, depending on the shots. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible by any means, it's just not what you consider DEMO material. There's alot of noise on the image ie. BG walls and white shirts, but maybe this was an intentional aesthetic choice by Ron Howard, who knows. On the good side, there are some amazing shots that TRUELY take your breath away, and you can just FEEL how 3-Dimensional the image is. It was moments like these that even WOWED my folks, who immediately noticed the difference on my Panasonic 50\\" plasma. <br /> <br />SOUND QUALITY: 7/10 <br /> <br />On the sound front, it's not bad. Not as IMPACTFUL as my old DTS DVD, as it feels alot lower in volume and lacks that oooomph on the LFE front. But it's a still satisfying experience and far from terrible by any means. Overall, it's a very clean mix. <br /> <br />-zallapo
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Funny, very funny!<br /><br />Tim Burton directs this masterpiece of a bizarre richman, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), who was the perfect job: he owns the number one chocolate factory of the world. And what seams to be a dream, turns to be an nightmare: the children that get the Golden Ticket and enters de factory are haunted by their own unquallities.<br /><br />A lot of intelligent references to pop culture icons.<br /><br />The DVD comes with tons of extras, from behind the scenes takes to making offs and games.<br /><br />A true must-have to Burton's fans.
B000E5KJI4|5.0|'Wow' pretty much sums up my feelings for this HD-DVD. <br /> <br />Troy on HD-DVD is a true stunner by all means, Picture and Sound surpass anything previously released on DVD. This HD-DVD DELIVERS, and is now one of my demo discs. Apart from the few grainy shots at the beginning, this transfer is borderline flawless. <br /> <br />DVD vs HD-DVD comparison: <br /> <br />I have a video matrix router/switcher, and switching between the DVD and HD-DVD (via component for a fair comparison) shows how much better, sharper, brighter, and more detailed HD-DVD is. Chapters 3 and 9 are great examples of this if anyone is curious to demo to their friends. <br /> <br />Great stuff Warner Brothers. Keep up the fantastic work. <br /> <br />-zallapo

B000IMV4IW|3.0|CD 1: 45:25  CD 2: 42:02    Kinda short Ain't it?     It would all fit nicely on a C-90 Cassette or two vinyl albums. Noel may have been thinking in old LP terms, but we live in a CD/MP3 age where every compilation CD is filled up to 79 minutes. I was hoping for a really comprehensive set with every one of Oasis UK Singles and maybe a few great flip sides or rarities. Noel & Co. had the chance to put together a great singles compilation and he blew it by just picking his favorites, or the songs that go over well in concert. Maybe he wants us to buy a Oasis box set in a few years.    For new fans \\"Stop The Clocks\\" is a good present and fine introduction to some of Oasis best songs. But for old USA fans who have stayed loyal while Radiohead and Coldplay have stole their audience this set is a big disappointment. There's not a clunker in the bunch, but this set is missing so many great UK singles like \\"All Over The World\\" (which is being played all the time on the radio in the USA as part of an AT&T commercial) \\"Whatever\\" (which was never released in the USA) and \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" (a personal favorite). The way it is compiled, most of this CD leans too much on the first two albums.     There's so much good stuff missing, its hard to recommend this to any longtime Oasis fans except just to complete your collection. How about that box set Noel after you sign that big deal with Warners?

0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell started his career as a science writer, and went from lab to lab hearing countless amazing ideas. Eventually, he got rich writing about them.       People hailed his first book \\"The Tipping Point\\" as a genius new way of looking at marketing...but it wasn't really, it was just a collection of interesting stories of products that suddenly took off, unified by a single catch-phrase.       Blink is much like that book. It covers research about how people make snap decisions, informed and uninformed. But if you read it, don't expect a unifying theory from Gladwell. Instead, marvel at how-       -Observers of a single one-minute tape of a college professor can guess with startling accuracy what his student approval rating will be on end-of-semester surveys       -Researchers can view a 7 1/2 minute videotape of a couple talking to each other about any subject at all, break their facial expressions and miniscule reactions to one another into an algorhythm, and predict how long they'll stay together with over 90% accuracy       -A man gifted at reading facial expressions made a fortune at horse races just by getting a good look horses' faces before races.             Gladwell might not have all the answers for why these things happen, but for me, the book served as a wonderful \\"Science Digest\\", and I've since bought and read other books that follow up the more interesting chapters in more detail. If these kinds of topics interest you, this book is a winner.
B000056H24|5.0|This is a traditional telling of the life of Jesus, from before his birth to the resurrection.<br /><br />The cinematography is breathtaking, the color, the costuming, the writing aided by Carl Sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of Jesus weeping and then raising Lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring. It was this scene which motivated me to write this review.<br /><br />Rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb, Stevens has Jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff, puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill. Once there, Jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of Ivan Mestrovic and the French bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century. When Jesus reaches the high tomb, Stevens and Sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the God of life before Jesus calls out, \\"LAZARUS! COME FORTH!\\"  But in striking juxtaposition, Stevens pulls back the camera, hundreds of feet from the tomb showing Jesus, the Son of the Almighty, as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside, let alone the universe, much as the fist fight between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck in BIG COUNTRY, shows the scale of man to God's work. However, as Jesus calls-out Lazarus instead of seeing him rise, we see the wonderment, the bewilderment, the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss. We see in the crowd, as the camera dollies, rolls and scans, the faces of the believers, the unbelievers, the doubters and the ever faithful, their reactions to a man dead three days, reawakened by an act of God, brought forth by a human being, favored by God.<br /><br />How much more effective was this direction? Rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise, we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing, the awe, the tears of joy, the fear, the love, the attempts to reconcile with reality, the unbelievable. There was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring  artist or film director. My only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one, Jesus' (Max Von Sydow) hair is too short.<br /><br />If you believe, clap your hands, and even if you don't, its worth the 199 minutes of your time. I saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the VHS and DVD, and watched it with a group, one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the Lazarus scene.<br /><br />4.75 Starse is a must-see for an aspiring  artist or film director.

0393327655|5.0|At its heart, this book is about the difference between faith and reason. Faith is blind. It is not based on evidence or reason, and therefore offering evidence or reasons will not shake the faithful from their beliefs. Harris thinks that is very, very dangerous. It will come as no surprise to anyone that he began writing this book on September 12, 2001.<br /><br />Harris argues that relying on faith instead of reason is a bad way to lead your life. It leads to all sorts of weird and dangerous beliefs, prevents important scientific discoveries, and stirs hatred between people who hold mutually inconsistent faith-based beliefs. Of course, people make mistakes when they rely on evidence and reason, but at least if we rely on reason and evidence, we are moving in the right direction and we are open to changing our minds when we are wrong. If our beliefs are based on faith, we are stuck forever.<br /><br />This book will make religious people uncomfortable. Harris says exactly what he thinks, without making an attempt to spare the feelings of the religious. He does not, however, call anyone names or say anything in order to be mean or offensive. He simply states that facts as he sees them.<br /><br />Some reviewers claim that Harris is \\"intolerant\\" or a \\"fundamentalist.\\" They are wrong. Harris, unlike many religious leaders, fully supports the right to think, say and believe as you wish. He opposes any form of oppression. On other hand, Harris also reserves the right to think some beliefs are foolish. You probably do not respect the belief that Elvis is alive. Harris feels the same way about religious beliefs. He certainly would not want to see Elvis believers put in jail or denied rights, but he feels free to say that belief in Elvis is just plain wrong.

By 8 months, she would get mad when it was over! (can you say no to a child who wants to read it again who is not just trying to stay up later??!!)  At 10-months she looks away from \\"white dog\\" in the book to look for our white Maltese!  I am amazed that some of this is sinking in already-and wished I had read to my other 2 children earlier!  Have yet to see how long Brown Bear holds her interest, but so far its value is more than I ever imagined.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Neil Burger has created a rare successful period thriller in \\"The Illusionist\\", which he wrote and directed, inspired by Steven Millhauser's short story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\".  In Vienna circa 1900, an astonishing illusionist named Eisenheim (Edward Norton) attains such great fame and admiration that his conjuring feats inspire jealousy in Austria's Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The Prince is determined that no one should possess greater power or cleverness than himself, so he insists that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) uncover Eisenheim's secrets. What Uhl discovers is more volatile than trade secrets: Eisenheim has renewed a romance with his childhood friend Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), whose expected marriage to Leopold is key to the Prince's political ambitions.<br /><br />While most period thrillers are burdened by their accoutrements, \\"The Illusionist\\" is immensely entertaining. And it couldn't look better. The film's deep blacks and rich browns are beautiful compliments to Eisenheim's inscrutable character. Phillip Glass' score is perfection -and as essential a component as the characters and visuals. Edward Norton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Giamatti, playing three intelligent men with veiled ambitions, create the tension that drives the story. Sewell is particularly memorable as a powerful man frustrated politically and now personally, a consummate rationalist  who sometimes fails to master his own emotions. Prince Leopold is fictional but was evidently inspired by the mysteries surrounding the death of the real Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria.<br /><br />A few weaknesses in the script prevent \\"The Illusionist\\" from being a 5-star movie for me: The romance is a bit feeble. The Duchess is too old to be a suitable match for the Crown Prince, as her prime child-bearing years are past. The principle problem in the story that sets Eisenheim scheming and the plot in motion could be resolved by much simpler means. So it's not quite convincing. But these characters are fascinating. The magic is captivating. The production reproduced the conjuring acts by the same methods they would have been performed a century ago, to the extent that it was possible. The great practitioner and historian of the magic arts Ricky Jay consulted on the film. \\"The Illusionist\\" is thoroughly enjoyable and bound to inspire awe for magicians past and present.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 short interview pieces, a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and an audio commentary. \\"The Making of The Illusionist\\" (4 min) features interviews with the cast in which they talk about their characters and the film. \\"Jessica Biel on The Illusionist\\" (1 1/2 min) mostly repeats the interview from \\"The Making of...\\". The audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger is the best bonus feature. Burger discusses the film's themes of class, power, and uncertain reality, casting, period manners, telling the story from Uhl's point of view, and filming challenges. He also reveals how the magic tricks were done and what enhancements were made for the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.ese characters are fascinating.

B000286RKW|5.0|What can you say that has not been said about \\"Goodfellas\\". Growing up in Queens NY myself I have great passion for this movie. De Niro,Liotta and Pesci are at there best or should I say worst. They are a ruthless bunch of smiling at your face and shoot you in the back of the head kind of fellas.This film is based upon true events and with a big splash of Mr. Martin Scorsese's artistic flair this movie is a instant classic. For fans of the \\"Soprano's look for Christopher and Pauly Wallnuts early in there careers .
B00003CX95|5.0|I can't say enough good things about \\"Braveheart\\". After watching it several times through the years, it's still inspiring, moving and heart-felt. This is definitely a movie that I'd recommend anyone to buy or at least watch!

0142004235|5.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden is truly a work of art, blending history and Biblical allusions into a masterpiece. The story is set in Salinas Valley, California, and follows the journey of the Trasks and the Hamiltons, two families whose fates intermingle in a beautiful and devastating relationship. The characters each find his or her own path in life and inevitably meet one another, impacting each character's life in the most profound and unique way. Throughout the novel, Steinbeck touches on powerful themes, including fate versus freewill and the search for one's true identity as well as the complications and consequences of both requited and unrequited love.  <br /> <br />The novel is separated into three sections, each an interesting story that reveals a part of the characters' lives. The stories overlap, as characters grow older or pass away between sections. Relationships are renewed, broken, or newly established. As the plot progresses, the characters become involved in more than one story, creating a complicated yet beautifully woven story.  <br /> <br />Each character on his or her own contributes part of his or her life to the ever-growing plot. From the secretive Cal and the lovable Aron to the murderous and vengeful Cathy, each character presents a different personality, either fitting or contrasting with other characters. The reader can sympathize with Cal, who is jealous of his good-natured brother Aron and wishes to be accepted as much as his sibling. The reader can relate to the boys' experiences, innocent young children who grow up and commit sins and lose their childish naiveté. Referring to the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck elevates the story of these two brothers to Biblical proportions, setting the foundation of behavior and emotions that every person goes through. The effect of Steinbeck's allusions is that the reader applies the story to his or her own life, making chilling discoveries on how similar people are, no matter the difference in character. The relationships between these unique individuals of the novel have such a powerful impact on their lives that the reader is forced to stop and wonder at the ways people are affected and altered, regardless of the size of the change.  <br /> <br />Steinbeck's masterpiece reveals to the reader the way people touch each other's lives and the impact of these changes through the intricate relationships between his characters. East of Eden is at once both powerful and mesmerizing, a literary journey that captures the audience's heart and leaves the reader deep in thought long after completing the book. East of Eden is highly recommended, not only as a beautiful work of art to cherish but also as a guide to self-discovery.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Americans are so hung up about sex: Show an american a sex-scene and they totally loose their marbles, and the film rating system reflects this. This film is about people trying to find completion in their life, whether it's having an orgasm, having a sense of self-worth, realizing ones dreams. <br /> <br />The film attempted to tackle the dispair felt by a group of people outside the normal moires of society. The shortbus club provided an accepting community, a place where the main characters could be themselves, in the same manner that the sexual therapist attempted to provide a safe place for her clients to talk through their problems.  <br /> <br />An excellent movie, sure to provoke some reaction in the viewing audience. <br /> <br />
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins could be the most important scientist-as-educator alive today and there may be no more important issue than the destabilizing influence of religion in our world.  Put the two together and you have a book that should be read by everyone.  In particular, if you are questioning what your parents and culture have told you about deity; if you are ready for a clear, comprehensive, blunt consideration of the facts about religion; and especially if you are afraid to step away from faith because of how you fear your family or culture may react, this one's for you.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|It's bluesier than his past albums, but on most tracks this enhances the feel of the album.  Once again, John Mayer has a stand-out sentimental relationship-related track in \\"Heart of Life\\".  If you like John Mayer's previous albums, you will like this one too.
B0000C6DWU|5.0|\\"Finding Nemo\\" is an exceptional story about surrender and faith.     While the film's deeper messages might be perceived as too advanced for children, it's presented in a way that will no doubt leave a strong impression on your child.    The story follows Nemo's father Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Marlin's new-found friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) through oceans of turbulence and unpredictability as Marlin searches for Nemo (Alexander Gould), who was taken by deep sea divers and added to a salt water aquarium full of charming and entertaining characters.    For big people, we learn that \\"letting go\\" reigns supreme while on a difficult journey. Dory's blissful and forgiving innocence somehow manages to quell Marlin's tightly wound fears. And the results always find them exactly where they need to be--that much closer to Nemo.    A clown fish who was born with his right fin smaller than the left, Nemo teaches us of the unconditional love we can have for ourselves--even with all of our physical imperfections.    This film is way above average. A lot of depth, humor and of course--cuteness.
0671027344|5.0|This book was extremely well-written from the character's point of view and I really was able to learn a lot from this book.  It just gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling in the end as I think all books should.  It also gets you thinking about yourself and your place in it as well.
B000063DFS|5.0|As far as lyrics go, \\"No More Tears\\" is Ozzy's best. In certain songs, there are glimmering hints of how honest he was with himself while getting clean. That takes courage.    \\"Road to Nowhere\\" summarizes a moral inventory Ozzy takes during his recovery days. While cryptic, the guilt and shame he expresses is balls-out honest and well put.     In \\"I Don't Want to Change the World,\\" he sets his boundaries with religious hypocrites. But what stands out is his own relationship with God.     If you're expecting Sabbath, \\"Blizzard,\\" or \\"Diary,\\" put your expectations away. This album is unique, yet still light years ahead of so many more albums out there. As is to be expected with every album by Ozzy and band.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|Well, not quite.  If I hear one more person call this a \\"mash up\\", I'm going to . . . <br /> <br />Simply put, this album rules.  Sgt. Pepper was FORTY YEARS AGO this year.  I remember vividly getting my first Sgt. Pepper CD at the 20-year anniversary of the record, when CDs were still quite new.  I still have it.  It felt so vivid, fresh and NEW.  Well, I had given up hope that anything Beatles related would ever feel new again.  The anthologies were good, but they didn't quite cut it.  This record breathes new life yet again into the best rock music ever.  Try it out in DTS or DD 5.1.  It's the bomb.  Before those tapes disintegrate, I hope George or Niles can re-master everything in the catalogue plus anything else decent that has never been released.  Hopefully my old ears will still be good enough to appreciate it all.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Sergent York, was a real American hero who did it for his country during WW1 . His amazing story unfolds here in my state of Tennessee in a small town called Pallmall in northern east Tennessee. His exploits are enjoyed by thousands as he went to war and was against killing as the Bible teaches.He actually killed to save lives and singlehandled captured 132 Germans and was exclaimed a hero and decorated for it.It is a great movie by Gary Cooper and Walter Brennen. Also June Lockheart ( Lassie Fame) played Alvins sister.It's a piece of history you will want to see over and over.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Let's face it, there are some bands that can continue to stay relevant throughout the course of a lengthy career (R.E.M., Depeche Mode, The Cure, and I'm sure Radiohead will have the staying power), some bands that knew when to pack it in before the well potentially dried up leaving them as shells of their former selves ... and then there are the bands that continue on long after their expiration date, long after they are capable of producing any relevant material.  Among these bands are Goo Goo Dolls, U2, and ... Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br /><br />To use a well-worn cliche, these Peppers are becoming quite mild in middle age.  By far the most exciting years for this band were the ones with Jack Irons on drums and the late Hillel Slovak on guitar (I urge all newbie RHCP fans to check out Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, pronto), the years when the band had an innovative sound, an energetic stage show and was the antidote to generic corporate rock.  After Slovak's untimely passing, the band recruited John Frusciante and cut two solid albums in the same vein, albeit a bit more calculated and mainstream.  Frusciante departed to focus on his bizarre solo recordings, and with new guitarist Dave Navarro the band moved away from funk and in a decidedly more hard rock direction with One Hot Minute, which, while far from their best album, was at least interesting and inspired.  Navarro eventually left (his style was an odd pairing with the other members of RHCP), and Frusciante returned. The next album, Californication, brought another change in direction - it marked the beginning of the metamorphosis of the Chilis from red hot to quite bland and mild. Yes, there were a couple of songs that hinted at the band's prior days of glory, but much of the album consisted of songs aimed at the soccer mom set.  This is a trend that continued even more with the next album, By The Way.  That sets the stage for the band's latest release, the double-disc Stadium Arcadium.<br /><br />Does the band improve and show the fire and inspiration of the same group that gave us \\"Me & My Friends\\", \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\" and \\"Fight Like A Brave\\"?  Alas, no. The only thing this group has in common with the group that recorded those songs is a name.  Stadium Arcadium offers a whole bunch of safe, gentle light pop songs that are pretty much all about love and about how great the state of California is.  That's right, Anthony Kiedis is still preaching and trying to convert the uninitiated on the wonders of California.  Anthony, if you are lacking inspiration this much where half of your songs are about California, perhaps you should just go work for the California Board of Tourism instead.  Making matters worse is that the energy and enthusiasm that the Peppers once displayed is all gone - what's left is a band content to repeat themselves over and over again, coming up with little more than rewrites of previous hits in the hopes that they can buy more mansions and luxury cars.<br /><br />It is often stated by RHCP's defenders that their critics can't handle change.  That is not true.  The reviews are taking the band to task for putting little effort into their albums for the sake of cashing in on the hapless consumer hoping for another Uplift or Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  Instead, we're getting the same tired light pop that has been done to death by tons of other bands and retreads of prior bland hits like \\"Scar Tissue\\" and \\"Under The Bridge\\", proving my point about this band - they're only in it for the money.  Essentially, you've got the ballad (\\"Snow (Hey Oh), \\"Stadium Arcadium\\"), the soft pop song (\\"Dani California\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\"), and the toothless tame \\"rock\\" song (\\"Readymade\\", \\"Hump De Bump\\"). There is no change to be found - the band has recorded the same two or three songs over and over again since 1999. That's not evolution - that's regression.<br /><br />In summary: It disappoints me to say this about a band I once loved, but Red Hot Chili Peppers (or should we call them The Sweet Lollipops instead?) have worn out their welcome a long time ago.  They only remain popular because they write very similar, indistinguishable songs that are as catchy (and vapid) as commercial jingles.  All this weak music is only going to tarnish their legacy, as it is vastly inferior to their first six albums (yes, even One Hot Minute).  Throw them right into the dinosaur rock heap of bands that continued to record material that is obviously inferior to their earlier output, much like U2 and the Stones.  Basically, the dull artwork tells you all you need to know about the music within.  I suggest passing on this album unless you think Nickelback, The Fray, Maroon 5 and other shallow \\"lite rock\\" bands are geniuses. If you want to hear the Chilis that took the music industry by storm, check out s/t, Freaky or Uplift instead.
B000H5U832|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 5 year old grandson, who had been waiting for it to come to video.  He is a car and truck nut!!  Loved the movie, even my 60 year old husband loved watching it and the ending nearly brought him to tears!!  Wonderful story with a great moral.  Every family with or without kids will love this movie
B00008EYBW|5.0|I have not seen this movie in some time and have just now ordered the DVD but I have seen it many times in the past and find it to be excellent as well as a perfect companion piece to Keira Knightley's recent Pride and Prejudice.  The film is not \\"pretty\\" in the usual sense of the word and as another reviewer pointed out, Anne is not pretty (nor is she supposed to be) when we first meet her but as the film and her character develop she becomes beautiful (as those we grow to love become beautiful in our eyes and our hearts) and very deserving of Ciaran Hinds whose \\"majesty\\" is overwhelming.  We all know that true love will win out in Austen but the glory of her writing was in the details of how that love is accomplished in the face of overwhelming obstacles as personified in unforgettable personages who create unbelievable situations (the proud and the prejudiced if you prefer).  Mary the hypochrondiac sister is a character for all ages; Sir Michael Redgrave, in my mind, will always be remembered for his full-frontal face camera shot, looking like a nineteenth century Donald Trump as the word is spit from his small mouth: \\"RETRENCH?\\"  A perfect moment in a perfect film from a perfect author.
B00008EYBW|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of Jane Austins Persuasion. If you like A&E's Pride & Prejudice this is a great follow up. This is a bonus that you get the book with the DVD. I think that the director does a fantastic job of catching the whole jest of the story and there are lots of visual symbolism going on, such as the parade at the end. Bon Apetite<br /><br />Update 2012: Have seen PBS more recent adaptation and it is not as good, this is the one to watch. Amanda Root  does a much better performance.

B000J3EEBY|4.0|This is rather interesting to listen to as at times there are songs that can catch your attention, some that one is not sure of wanting to keep listening to. Very good if one is wanting to hear Egyptian music as Loreena does a good job with that on this CD. This is a very, very good CD though her cd The Visit is my favorite one of all time.
B000JLTRJ0|5.0|This movie was great. It was awesome to see Oliver Stone give 9/11 the special treatment and respect to the actual event as it happend. My only gripe about the DVD is that it was not presented in its full movie  aspect ratio of 2.35.1 This is one of Oliver Stones favorite formats and it unfortunately  had to be done in the \\"enhanced for 16x9 modes\\" I am a huge fan of movies done in 2.35.1 Hopfully this movie will be re released as a special edition edition that showcases the whole movie. I looked at the movie database online and they list the aspect ratio as 2.35.1. I know most people wouldn't care about this  but once you see what you are actully missing you  get used to seeing movies in the letteboxed format. Check out widescreen.org   for more info and some side  by side comparisons.

B000I2IT44|5.0|what can you say about this band that has not already been said. easily the greatest band in the last 20 years. IN ABSTENIA AND DEADWING, think DARK SIDE OF THE MOON AND WISH YOU WERE THERE! Steve Wilson is the best lead singing and lead guitarist since David Gilmour. the drummer is a young Neil Peart. the bassist a smiling John Paul Jones. excellent keyboards and rythym guitar. start with SIGNIFY and just buy everything since then. my favorite DVD is PINK FLOYD at pompei. a mindblowing dream. but PT comes close.

079073804X|5.0|This movie is hands down the best horror movie ever made, period!  I am not very easily disturbed or creeped out by the vast majority of horror movies, but this movie is truly different.  Each time I watch it, it causes me to shudder because of the graphic evil nature of the story and the amazing realism of the movie.  The sound effects are so creepy....nothing short of fantastic.  All I can say is if you totally want to be frightened and shook up by a movie with a tremendous storyline and great acting, watch The Exorcist!!!

As the seasons progress, the characters in the show evolve a little bit and slowly become the crazy characters that we've all grown to love.  They all have such perfect chemistry together.  One of my favorite episodes in this collection is The Baby Shower.  I love when George rehearses his revenge speech that he plans to give the lady who spilled chocolate all over his nice red shirt!  Ha....classic!!  The extra features in this collection are awesome, too.  Just buy this DVD set or you'll be yelling, \\"SERENITY NOW!!\\"

0743289412|5.0|This is just an absolutely moving book. It evokes such emotion related to Lisey and Scott's love that I think any married person can relete to in a very personal way. How does he get into a woman's head so well? He has done it before in other books and does it again here. The subtext of mental illness is also dealt with an interesting and chilling way. No one admits it publicly but we all have a lot of these skeletons in our family closets. <br /> <br />Others have brought up being annoyed by the repetitive phrases (SOWISA, bad gunky, perfectly hu-uge,etc.). I was annoyed by this at first, but reflected on my marriage and others' and realized that we all do have a sort of internal language/code that indeed would seem silly and repetitive to the outside world, but that's the way it really is. <br /> <br />The plot may seem disjointed, but many a famous author has jumped around like this---a common way to put focus on the main character rather than the plot itself. <br /> <br />Overall, a great read. highly recommend
B000I5X81K|2.0|I purchased this CD as a gift for my Mom who is a huge Groban fan, but she said this was one of his worst!  She was disappointed, saying that it hardly sounded like the Josh Groban she listens to!  Now I'm skeptical about purchasing any other CD's of his.
0812550757|5.0|For an author to win the Hugo and Nebula awards for one book is an honor, but Card won (and deserved to win) both awards for Ender's Game AND for Speaker. As much as I loved Ender's Game, Speaker for The Dead is one of my all-time favorite books.  Ender Wiggin is such an interesting, intense and tragic figure but at the same time he is the dictionary definition of the \\"good guy.\\"  In this book he has accepted humanity's responsibility for destroying an alien race and is attempting to atone for the act of xenocide by finding a home for the lone surviving Bugger queen and by saving a new alien race.  The characters in Speaker for the Dead - human and non-human - are incredibly well-written and so engaging.  The storyline is nothing short of brilliant.  I would recommend this book highly to anyone, regardless of whether or not they are sci fi fans.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|\\"Babel\\" is the latest film from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who also served as co-producer with Steve Golin and Jon Kilik.  The story begins in a desolate region in the Moroccan desert where two brainless boys decide to see how far a new rifle can fire by using a tour bus full of people as target practice.  One bullet critically injures an American woman (Cate Blanchett) who along with her husband (Brad Pitt) is recovering from the death of their infant.  This new tragedy follows a series of earlier tragedies (including the suicide of a Japanese woman) and begins another series of tragedies (including the deportation of the couple's illegal immigrant nanny, played beautifully by Adriana Barraza).<br /><br />With the loud, abrasive action jumping back and forth through time, and from place to place (Morocco, Japan, America, and Mexico), and from one story to another, this is an exhausting film to follow.  In one story, the two Moroccan boys and their dysfunctional family try to escape justice.  In a related, but separate story, the American couple (portrayed with great sincerity and passion by Pitt and Blanchett) struggle in a life-or-death situation aided by the incompetent, though sympathetic, locals in a nearby village.  Meanwhile in California, the couple's children are being taken care of by a loving Mexican nanny who foolishly takes the children with her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) to a wild wedding party across the border.  In yet another story, with the most tenuous of thematic threads to link them, a teenaged deaf-mute Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) runs around the city without panties trying to lose her virginity.<br /><br />Each story reveals characters with communication problems:  The American couple can't talk about the baby's death or the husband's earlier desertion; the boys have never told their parents about their sister's incestuous peep shows, the nanny is not only ignorant of the English language, but of American laws; the Japanese girl, who besides having difficulty communicating with anyone who's not deaf, has a strange and strained relationship with her father.<br /><br />This raw, depressing drama earns its R rating by providing in-your-face depictions of violence, nudity, survival, desperation, fear, and isolation.
