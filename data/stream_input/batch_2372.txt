B00991TCOG|5.0|Urgent,immediate and passionate, Ms Stirling rips and rocks musical magic.  Mercy woman! I am a mere mortal.  Ms Stirling i is superbly innovative.
B00447L4JG|5.0|still a very fun and enjoyable movie --great songs ( tho I have to admit they have to \\"grow\\" on you)---love the movie
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent book; can't put it down! I read it while on the treadmill and it makes me just keep on walking!!
B00A83075M|5.0|love this movie -cute funny and thoroughly enjoyable --me and my sons try and beat each other as to who can name the various game characters ( have to admit in honesty --they win --drat)-<br />great concept --what do games do after the arcade closes for the night---fun
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I saw the previous cliff hanger episode on tv and really wanted to see the outcome of the next episode, so I ordered it. Castle is a really wonderful and addictive show! I missed out somehow, on the first 4 seasons likely due to programming conflicts with some other show I watched  at the time, but now can't get enough of Castle! The chemistry between Castle and Beckett sizzles and his character is the epitome of what a woman wants in a man. Someone who is careing, attentive, loyal, funny, with a fantastic sense of humor, wit, charisma along with fantastic masculine looks and charm!  Beckett also is the poster girl for what most women would like to be. Tall, gorgeous, independent, yet vulnerable inside but still able to 'keep her cool', even though she is torn up with her personal conflicting feelings, emotions, and trust issues with Castle.<br />It is ONE great show and I hope that it goes on for years.  I could live with the couple getting married and even having a kid together.  That would certainly 'spice up their lives' and put a new twist on the show in the future!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Very thought provoking game and loved the price (FREE!!!!).  My 5 year old grandson enjoys playing it also even though he tends to cheat with the hint option.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My girls love this game and my boyfriend too it is relaxing after you have a long day at work
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Very addictive game but great for memory improvement.  Even my 5 year old grandson enjoys playing it.  Was a great freebie deal.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had know idea what to expect, Someone recommended this book to me. I really love the story-telling technique and the storyline.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Love the show. Some of the stuff they have Walter say and do is a bit absurd, but I think it's almost the point of his char at this time.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Super fast delivery! We loved the LOTR movies so this was a great treat for us to see! Just a great movie and the effects were great!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am waiting to receive Season 3 which I have ordered.  Excellent acting and wonderful story.  I received the version for the UK at first and had to return it.  Waiting now for the correct version (for the U.S.)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This man begins his life as a non-believer.  This is the true story of his journey through his week in a coma.  It is an amazing encounter with the world beyond this one.  I would highly reccommend this book.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Really enjoyed the adult humor.  Most children would have a hard time keeping up with the level of subject matter portrayed in this flick.  But overall can be enjoyed by the whole family.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These were very good books. Even though the thought of the storyline is disturbing, they are well written and very good books.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|By season 3, the Federation's Earth members are earning reluctant respect from the Vulcans, who are doing their best to keep those impulsive Earthlings from playing cowboy in the cosmos.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as well written as book 1 but very intriguing all the same. Could not put it down and it was an easy read. Looking forward to reading the last book in the series
B001TH16DI|5.0|If you have a really big HD screen, you gotta have this collection on Blu-ray. If you don't have a big screen now, it still is packed with lot's on nice Trek bonus content.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I do have problems when using FF, but I am not certain if that is because of my Kindle Fire or Facebook.  So I gave it four instead of five stars.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I really enjoyed the plot and action in this movie. I haven't had a chance to read the book, but now am eager to go ahead and read to compare and maybe get more insight into the characters,especially &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo&#34;.
B004WR125O|1.0|Never  did  get  this  to  work !! And  went  past  the  30  days,  so  I  couldn't  return  it.<br />When  you put  in  your  network password,  stars  show  up  as  if  it's  an  ATM !!<br />I'm  at  home  you  blockheads !!  I  guess I'm  spastic  because  I  can't correctly  enter my  24  digit password,  and  with  the  stars,  I  can't  see  what I'm  entering to  confirm  it's correct.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Loved this series. Was disappointed to have to pay for it since I was already a prime member. Missed beginning of season 3 .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book but ending abrupt-seems to be setting up for a sequel. I liked it though and would recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The whole Story you are wondering about how it is going to end! It is very intriguing, couldn't put my book down.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said.  I would love more extras and commentaries on these disks.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Well, the movie knocked my socks off, of course, so I got the novel.  It is also spell binding, and the movie evolves nicely from the novel.  There was a bit of the mother's struggle, patient-psychiatrist, and the father-son relationship that was left out of the movie.  I found those avenues rewarding.<br /><br />There was much less made of the dance contest in the novel.  Obviously it made for a nice visual dimension that a novel could not bring to the store.  There was nothing about double betting or point-spread in the book, which was good for me, as i find that stuff incomprehensible and boring.<br /><br />Reading the novel AND seeing the book will give you two perspectives of the same wonderful story about love, courage, mood disorders and perseverance.<br /><br />As a 55 yr Eagle fan, I also liked the backdrop of the Philadelphia Eagles' history in the McNabb-Reid glory era.  We aren't all THAT nuts!  Go Birds!!
B002EDH0FE|1.0|Just a personal opinion, but I didn't really enjoy Watchmen. I guess I was looking for a superhero movie to take me away from real life for a couple of hours. Instead I got a movie that reminded me of real life and made things even more depressing. The characters and actors are as unattractive and hard to like as people and things in the real world can be at times. If you're into being depressed and seeing the down side of things, this is just the movie for that. I understand what what trying to be done in the movie, but it's just not for me. Again...personal opinion.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Colors are bright. Tiles easy to see. Lots of variation and keeps me interested. It 's fast and just plain fun.
B005HSL626|5.0|My son who dislocated his knee found this and we play to pass the time while he's healing. Great for me since I'm not a big game player.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I just love this guy it's nice to have this playing while driving or cleaning the house or having a party can't wait to get more
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I liked it because it shows that man and an animal can become spiritually compatable.<br />It showed man's struggle with himself when it comes to fear and that all things are possible
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I liked the movie because it shows even a girl can do things besides acting like a prissy princess... It's a good movie to show little girls and being strong is okay...
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I'm so glad I stumbled across a review for this show on Amazon and decided to download a couple episodes.  It is completely captivating modern-day spin on Sherlock Holmes, with a great ensemble cast.  I'm working my way through the first season and I've enjoyed every episode.
B000NY12LO|5.0|A very engaging story.  It was riveting, and I couldn't stop reading it.  Very timely topic, as well.  Excellent story.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Very cute game, but the ads are relentless.  I understand the game is free, and I expected some advertising and pop-ups,  but this is excessive.  Really takes away from an otherwise adorable app.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The new Dr Who series is a fun flight of fancy that teaches us and makes us all long for a blue police box.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Where to start?  How else can you tell a tale of such dreadful history this country has inflicted toward Africans while captivating audiences to such level vileness among human beings? This needed to be told and the scars the past has left is still in needs sustained and methodical healing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series ever I can't wait for season 4 thank you all !!!!! Please don't take until October for next one !!!!!! Make it sooner !!!!!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Very easy to read. Nice big numbers.<br />Now I need to learn how to use it.<br />I like it too.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Fantastic blues music.  There are a lot of great tunes with different sounds to them.  For a live cd, this one has a wonderful tone that never gets tinny or has too much background/crowd noise.  By far, the best cd I've bought in several years!
0062064304|5.0|I loved the film and I loved this artbook where it shows all the production design and studies!<br />Is full of concepts and alien creatures, also there's a section of the book that shows all the guns used in the film!
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I like Jim Caviezel so I ordered this little movie to watch while I exercise in the morning.  It was a pretty good science fiction / action film with a good story and better than average special effects. It's not an epic but if you like the genre and Jim Caviezel you should enjoy this SCFI outing.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|We enjoy the songs and it's an encouragement for my daughter to sing along. Yahoo for pop songs. Thank you One Direction and all parties involved in creating the album.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|Saw the 2D version on Vudu and when I saw this, I had to have it.  The 3D version immerses you into the movie even further than the 2D version. I loved the movie and the plot. You hang onto everything in this movie, it's original and it's great!
B000MR592A|5.0|Devil Wears Prada is one of my favorite movies and Little Piggy Went to Prada Book was an added treat!<br />This is fantastic!!!!!!<br />Thanks for including the book! :-)
0452298482|4.0|Lot of things makes sense but hearing from really aged people makes it interesting. They went through the life and shared their life lessons. What should I do now is more important than what I could have done. Learn from mistakes, appreciate things around you and move on in the life. I enjoyed reading it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book wholeheartedly.<br /><br />It dealt with heavy subject matter in an unpretentious, down to earth manner. The characters were so believable, and the main ones were incredibly likeable.<br /><br />Cried buckets, but it was worth it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game tremendously. really when I first saw it I didn't really care for it as much.As I have been seeing other players play it I was surprised at hoe much fun it would be.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Great album. Glad I bought it and I couldn't be happier. Every single song is amazing. I have never listened to just one song and stopped, it is always start to finish.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This is, as always, a fantastic album from David.<br /><br />I am very happy that he collaborated again with long time friend and producer Tony Visconti.<br /><br />Their work together, along with the guitar work from Earl Slick, David Torn, and Gerry Leonard<br />really makes this album special.<br /><br />Another classic from David. Well done!!!
B002BRRTUO|5.0|So bad and cheesy that it becomes funny and awesome about halfway through. I would get it if I were you.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Each game episode takes only 30 seconds, so it is easy to kill a little time. You can synch it with facebook and go on the whole adventure. My grandkids all love it.
B000FA675C|5.0|Not only this book gave me an insight of pieces of history, but made me think and research of concepts new to me. This was kind of an awakening to me and I will always keep it to read it from time to time, between lines.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|When combined with isyncr, this makes for a great use of itunes and smart playlists.  Latest addition of grouping the videos by artist makes it easier to use.
B002GMSMHS|5.0|I can't wait for my charger to arrive, so I can start taking pictures of the spring arrivals in my yard. I am ecstatic at the earlier than scheduled arrival and the terrific packaging.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I was unprepared to see such extraordinary acting, historical significance and great cinematography. I really enjoyed Sally Fields' performance in this film.
B005MLOKXA|1.0|I've never seen a series that deteriorated season to season as much as the &#34;Good Wife&#34;.  I'm ashamed I ever watched the first episode. There was absolutely nothing &#34;good&#34; about the adulterous wife or cast in the entire series.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|great game; not too bad of music. after you upgrade for awhile; it gets better and better. I like the fact you have many different cars to choose from and upgrade.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|So much more than just a zombie horror show. This show really draws you in. If it hadn't been for sleeping and work, I would have watched this season straight through. I couldn't wait for the next show to start! I had to know what happened to Rick and his crew!<br />The storyline, acting, effects and cinematography are amazing!
B008602KQI|5.0|What a great movie! This was the second time for me to watch it and will watch it again! Amazon prime instant movies is a great deal! I canceled my Netflix account in favor of amazon.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The storyline just continues to impress me. I feel myself gasping and hanging on to the edge of my seat with each show. You fall in love with each character (each in their own quirky way). I couldn't wait to see season 3!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it will for sure keep you occupied.. my daughter and I both play this together its a fun game to play!!! when you aint got nothing to do!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Was looking forward to seeing Ted, but all the best lines were in the trailers.... Just seemed to fall flat for me.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Tarantino has don't it again.  Christopher waltz is probably my new favorite actor.  The movie is awesome and I am so surprised on how good Jamie fox was.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I thought (and doublechecked before ordering) that I was ordering just the DVDs, but got the Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultraviolet package instead. I had opened it before I relalized, so it was not returnable.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Thought it was entertaining.  Made me think about the possibilities that the future may hold for us.  So many ignorant people.
B00AIBZJLG|4.0|I haven't bought a 3D TV yet.  I've more than taken a peek, as I've looked at passive and active technology.  The problem that I have:  while the picture quality with active is terrific, the glasses are a total pain; and with passive, while the glasses are terrific, the picture quality is terrible.  (480P per eye, with visible horizontal lines, is completely unacceptable with current passive.)  I do believe that 4K TV will fix this problem, however, and it looks like it will be going mainstream by at least 2014, thank god.  With 4K, you will have passive glasses -- those that you use at the theatre -- with 1080P per eye.  Now THAT'S what James Cameron will be talkin' about!<br /><br />So, I didn't watch this in 3D because I haven't bought a 3D set yet.  But I'd imagine that this film would be pretty terrific in 3D; the cinematography is fantastic in 2D.  So, while I believe that this is a 3 star in 2D, I'm going ahead and bumping it up to 4 since I figured that that would be only fair.<br /><br />With regards to the film itself, the thing that I actually noticed most:  the music.  I thought that the opening act, with the eastern influences -- harmonic minors suggesting middle eastern, followed by Asian keys from even farther east -- was terrific.  But then, seemingly, the film wanted to appeal to a mainstream American audience, and so the western music had to come out; Elvis followed by the Beatles.  I have to say that, for my taste, most of the music in the 60s, outside of Jazz, just wasn't that great.  You did have musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, however, that had real talent and brought true innovation to the music scene.  Too bad they didn't use some of his stuff instead.  And how about Miles Davis?<br /><br />This film tells a story, a story that I won't discuss since that would be a spoiler.  But I liked that; it wasn't a bunch of acrobatics thrown in willy-nilly to just show off.  At least there was a common thread that ran through the film, even though thatthread was occasionally broken by varied music, some that I liked, some that I didn't, discussed above.<br /><br />Like I said, in 2D I'd say 3 stars.  But I'm sure that in 3D it will be 4.  And I can't wait to get that 4K TV so that I can pop on those passive glasses and watch this film again in 3D with 1080P per eye.  And those glasses won't put too much pressure on my nose, or risk battery death midstream.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is perfect for the kindle fire HD.  Very easy to use and navigate within.  Can work with Google chrome too.
B00BLGZDYA|1.0|What was the point? Way too bizarre and not entertaining. I usually like strange but this was way beyond.  Don't know why it made it onto critics lists.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|I'd heard the Harry Potter movie series were just like the books, so I decided to read the books one by one, then watch the movie for each. This movie had a few minor things from the book left out, but all in all was followed the book much better then others I've seen. It was adventurous, funny, action packed, and looked great too. I can't wait to continue the adventure one at a time!
0307272702|5.0|No one does a better job in digging out stats and showing that we have been told something that isn't true. I recommend this book to anyone that thinks they know the truth and then to see that they have been wrong about a lot of things. Hats off to Gary Taubes.
B00190OHD6|4.0|Enjoyed it but I would have preferred a bit more at the end.  I can use my imagination, but I prefer to see it happen.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was good romantic novel.  One that he doesn't get the girl in the end in the true sense of the word.<br /><br />Loved the ending
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Glad to see Ms Cornwell getting back to her good basic characters and past what seemed like  depression. Best book for some time.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is brilliant! It's free, fun, and extremely easy if you are good with technology. It could be considered hard to use if your working on a tablet that's touch-screen.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|not good not funny not what anyone should aspire to have in a relationship  in society or life. The end
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I'm fairly new to the whole Dr. Who craze but this was a great introduction. I love the 5th Doctor.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I love Johnny Depp movies because he's never in anything ordinary. And this movie is no exception. Fun script, funny dialogue, weird characters (like most of us!) and a happy ending--who could ask for more?
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this is an awesome little sharpener. It  does change the cutting edge angle on some knives but that's the beauty of it. It has a carbide slot to helr bevel and rough cut the edge and a stone  to for final sharpening. I've used this on several knives, hatches, and small swards and I love it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved it ! This series has everything.The acting is wonderful and the storyline is fantasticDon't know anyone that hasn't liked it
B001I45UFC|5.0|This series of stories by C.S. Lewis are wonderful.  They have a great moral to them.  I let my granddaughters borrow my hard copies so I purchased the set for my Kindle.  Enjoy being transported to Narnia!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loved to curl up at night and watch Downton Abbey on our large screen tv.Cann't wait until season 2 comes out!I hope this series goes on for many years.
B0012GTZFC|5.0|Transforms your business and your life the way \\"the three laws of performance \\" did.  This book opens your eyes to possibilities and changes \\"managements job is management\\"  to something that works for everyone<br />Highly recommend
B005GG0MIS|5.0|We read this book in my book club.  It was our April-2013 selection.  We had a robust discussion.  It was the first book in the history of our book club (we are in our 5th year) where EVERYONE LOVED THIS BOOK.  Each of us shared the tidbits we had learned.  Many of our views of our former presidents were softened.  Our republican members were softer on the democrat presidents.  The same was true for our democrat members and their take now on our republican presidents.  I was surprised to learn that Hillary Clinton was first a republican.  I was absolutely fascinated with the book. political parties could play &#34;nicer in the sand box&#34; on a daily basis.  We also felt that if this is what is available in the public domain then what is the rest of the story that is still classified.  So, this was a terrific book which easily exceeded our criteria for a good book for book club.  It engendered a rousing, emotional, heart felt, passionate, intelligent debate.  So, I rate this book AWESOME.  We are now considering the The President's Wives' Club as a future selection for our club.  Because, as is often said, &#34;behind every great man there is a great woman.&#34;
B0006LZPKS|4.0|We live at the Jersey Shore and enjoy the water all summer long. No problem getting them wet and they feel good on the feet even after walking in the water. Like any sandal they will let in rocks and sand and can be hot on the feet on the hottest days.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|I picked up Life of Pi because of a friends suggestion.  The little I know about the story came from movie trailers and going into this I figured it was going to be an entertaining trip for children and young adults.  I was wrong.<br /><br />It's Pi's story.  Our main character is an innocent Indian boy who has a deep love for both animals and for religion.  He is placed into an impossibly difficult situation and has to survive.  It's a story about the brutality of life and our will to survive, about how far we can be pushed before we are crushed by hopelessness.  This is NOT a children's story, we learn early on, Tigers are not your friend!<br /><br />It's not just the story that's captivating, the author, Yann Martel, writes very well.  The pacing of the story is great and the text just seems to flow.<br /><br />PS This is my first review, I was spurred to write it not just because I loved the novel (I love a lot of novels), but mainly because another reviewer (who gave a one star review) spoils the ending of the book with no warning.  I thought it was in bad taste (as I commented on the review) and wanted to give prospective readers a chance to see that there was a spoiler out there.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy it!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Season 2 left me pondering how Alicia's decisions are influenced by her environment, and initiated many self-evaluations as per how MY surroundings influence MY decisions.  I appreciate the ethical prodding in the plots.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A treat whether you're a patriot, history fan, or just interested in great acting and production values. Giamatti, Linney, Wilkinson, and Morse shine. A couple of times I was moved to tears in the first two episodes. Delightful.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|If you like British humor you will enjoy this.  Unfortunately, there are several sad issues which don't seem to ever get resolved.  I guess this is the way of soap operas.  Still riveting, however.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Definately not a book I would recommend to a friend to read. I would never have purchased this book, but the book club I belong to chose this as our next reading material.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  It gets a little slow sometimes, but not bad.  The graphics are very nice.
B008S8PPPG|5.0|Jessie Ware's &#34;Devotion&#34; cd is not an easy find in the states. I only found her music by a youtube coincidence. Every song on her cd reflects a great deal of passion and focus. Jessie's voice reflects maturity while flirting with an innoncence. Although her music has an upscale gloss appeal there exists a great urban rhythm throughout that brings a fresh take on music that allows Jessie to pierce through the sonic landscape with her angelic, hypnotic voice with original backbeat rhythms. I am really surprised to see in the states she is not larger or more popular. Every track is an easy catapult for her to be recognized and appreciated. I bought her cd as there were no stateside release outlets. This cd is quite easily the best release in the past several years. It is original and thought provoking. I play it every day. If you want music that will soothe you yet challenge your mindset... check out Jessie Ware.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I am collecting all the season, I have watched this show from the beginning.  I will sit back and watch it when i retire and have more time to relax in live.  Love the show
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|Even though I had music on the game off, it kept jacking up the volume on my MP3 playback which was running simultaneously on my Kindle. Would be fun if not for that.
0802473164|5.0|Gentlemen this book will give you so much insight and help you to develop a stronger relationship with the woman in your life.  I originally got the book to help me counsel men, it has done that and more.  It has truly helped me.  IT IS A TRUE BLESSING.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz still has it -  loved this new CD but then again I enjoy all Boz's music.  He does a variety of songs all which I enjoyed.

0140564349|5.0|This book has been a delight for my grand, and great grand children.  A very good story for preschoolers.  Thank you.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|Great movie - bought it for my kids for Easter - the only negative is, I wish they wouldn't have casted Santa with tattoos.  Our kids are faced with so many challenges and temptations these days, they don't need to face them in a kids movie!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey tells it like it is and in such a way that you can relate it to your own life. She is extremely funny and laugh out loud in this book! I definitely recommend it if anyone is even just a some what fan of hers.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love this Cinderella twist!  It's a great retell of the old classic!  Lots of adventure, drama, and romance! A great Friday night watch!
0723257639|5.0|This was the perfect gift for our granddaughter. Beautifully bound books, each with its own outer paper cover, strong and lovely box. A gift that our daughter who, like us, is a book lover, truly appreciated. Can expect it to last for generations.
1452123071|5.0|My nephew is 4 and a huge Star Wars fan.  Thought these would be perfect to mail small notes to him.  They arrived today and I browsed through them.  Lol - I need to send some to my adult friends.  30 cards of clever fun.  Now if I just knew some good Star Wars jokes to write on the back.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I loved every minute of this...Great story...and just a BEAUTIFUL film! Watched it twice the 1st day! It will be a classic in our film library.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I had bought several cases before this one. I  saw this one that rotates which makes MY job easier. I LOVE IT, this is definitely worth the price.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It is really easy to just sit down and listen to Rodriguez.  He does have his own unique style of lyrics.  Music is good and will enjoy continuing listening to his tunes.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A great game very addictive you just DON't want to put it down and I love it keeps generating stuff when you do
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a very intense, deep novel. I was scared by how relatable and personal this book was. I could relate to all the emotions that the main character felt. GREAT book!!
B00B2166BS|4.0|I think that it's great to not use the USB port for charging.  It won't wear out as quickly, and it's freed up for other uses, but I had read that it Pogo would charge a lot faster than USB, and I'm not seeing it.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Not the greatest game in the world...kind of repetitive...but an excellent way to pass time enjoyably.  I'm actually stumped on the level I'm working so the game does become more complex as you move through the levels.  I'll eventually solve it and I'm having fun trying.  I would recommend the game.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|i always love watching this movie everytime it is on tv and now i can watch it without commercials! it has good effects for the time and a great story to go with it. i love the message of it as well.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|One of the most important people in American....and world history! Lincoln was portrayed in the most thoughtful, reflective rendition from Spielbergs project....I can't say enough superlatives. I love this adaptation....and it was a shot in my arm!!  Bravo!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A very enjoyable show with superb acting performances and a very compelling story. Both, my husband and I loved watching the second season as much if not more as the first.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a great app! if u like fun games u will love this!!! my little brother is 3 and he loves it!!! AWESOME APP!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This movie has an unexpected twist in the plot when MM represents a man who strongly claims he is innocent. I watched it on my computer using Amazon Prime free online videos.  If I paid to see it in the movie theatre, I would have probably given the movie 4 stars because it is hard to beat laying in my bad wrapped in a blanket with my pillow watching a movie in my most comfortable position.  Nevertheless, I think the actors and actresses (such as Marisa Tomei) did well in the movie and it had a very intriguing plot.  I am glad that they had a very beautiful age appropriate woman in the movie and didn't search for a female star in the nurseries of hollywood.  I had to stop it halfway through and I couldn't wait to come back and finish the movie the next night.
B005UD1D62|5.0|Another easy read by Lauren Conrad.  Keeps you interested and wanting to read more.  I would recommend any Lauren Conrad book to anyone!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|No plot, predictable, poor acting. A waste of time.<br /><br />This thing requires more words, but you already know what I think of this movie.
B005KELW26|2.0|This cover did not fit my Kindle Fire, I can put the Fire in it, but cannot secure it into the tabs.  I do use it as a cover when throwing the Fire into my purse, but cannot use it for everyday.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had the free version and wanted more sounds so I purchased the Premium version. It is very customizable with pages of sounds. The kids love it, too! I used it to make sunny day sounds for our indoor Easter Tea Party, and I've used it for Campfire/Nighttime sounds when reading the kids stories in bed. I also love playing moving water sounds when the kids are having company over so I can get some sleep. :-D<br />This app is a must have.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|Best Album that I own.  I love it!  Highly recommend for the relaxing beach vibe!  Exactly what I wanted.  Enjoy!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Even though I can't draw well, I love this game. It is so much fun to play. Too many people cheat and just use letters and don't even try to draw something and they are so rude about it.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|was a little disappointed with this video after reading so many good things about it.  wasn't long before the family got tired of playing with it
B005ETA5K2|5.0|It really works. Brings in Wi-=Fi signal from afar. I have two and have gotten some for others and they all work great. Did have some trouble in installing it on one computer. Had to give up on that one.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|Thot it would be utterly humorous movie but it seems to be wicked. A different sense of humor is needed to be able to laugh on this movie. At the end left a distaste.
B00633W614|3.0|A book that the ending is another cliffhanger, thus luring the reader into buying the next book to find out what happens.  I refuse to be manipulated.  The Harry Clifton chronicles should be ONE book.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Ok, I know some people say Kristin Stewart can't act, but I think she can.  Granted she has a different style than some of the others, but she does a good job.  Charleze is awesome in this film and I think she deserved an award for it.  The story is interesting and believable.  The extended version adds a little more to the story that makes it make more sense.  I liked the movie enough to buy it and have watched it several times since.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What story lines - - - what actors - - - - - and what a beautiful home to have as Downton Abbey.  Thank you, Duke and Duchess.
B002BWP49M|5.0|What's not to like about this movie?  The special edition features are great. I really enjoyed both the movie and the special edition features.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I hang on every word of all th actors, but especially the infamous and gracious Maggie Smith.  She never lets up.  Congrats, Ms. Smith.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Entertaining.  Great for a movie night in.  Appeals to both sexes - both my husband and I liked it.  Worth the five bucks!
B00886XQO0|5.0|The microphone is perfect for picking up my voice, even when i'm speaking quietly.<br />The sound is simply amazing. I find myself using these to watch movies as well as play games more and more.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Powerful movie. You'd never think someone would go so far for a drink. Makes you think how bad it all can be.
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|I bought this movie so that I could introduce one of my childhood favorites to my 5yr old son. I love sitting with him and watching the movie. It's just as great as I remembered.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put this book down....it keeps you wanting to know more.<br />Get it now... you will be hooked also.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My son and I love this movie. The only problem now is that he insists on watching it so often.<br />Overall, it's a good problem to have.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Miss Hunt since Mad About You...and I feel this  is her finest work. The movie deals with a subject most of us wouldn't think about. Sex, desire, curiosity, fear and courage with those we think less likely. This movie is graphic beyond the nudity so beautify shared here. The emotions are raw and real and honest. It's an adult movie I saw and knew that I must have..this one's a keeper...see it with someone you love...
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I discovered Mumford and Sons and their sound just makes my heart beat a lot better! I relate to their sound and would definitely recommend Babel.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I can tell this will be a book I come back to again and again.  Lots of symbolism and thought provoking imagery.  A true masterpiece I am happy I got to experience.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|These movies have the best songs, I love the last track with the compilation of carter burwell, and the special part two of 1000years
B008FPOIT6|5.0|What an amazing adventure, all for the love of books - the visit to our favorite sanctuary that never ends - to relive in our minds again and again. What could be the ultimate clash, and timely at that, of paper and pen vs. technology, we find that both are needed to exist, and excel. Recommend this book highly, as one of those markers in our journey that reminds us of why we love books so much, and how they return that love!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|When I need a good laugh I go talk to Tom. Everyone should try talking with Tom. Check it out today!<br /><br />RT
B000IJ79WU|5.0|For someone who knows the Superman movies inside and out, this is a fantastic surprise.  To see the story re-told and re-packaged is fun.
B003M70O5O|5.0|It takes considerable effort to improve a series that started off so well, but Sons of Anarchy does get even better this season.  The plot and characters seems like they have more to them and the cliff hanger makes you want to jump right into the next season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is my favorite app!!!  So get it.  I have made about 20 worlds already and I never get bored.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|This app appears to be a copy of an old version of &quot;Bridge Constructor&quot;, but they may or may not be the same developer using 2 different names.  I can't think of a legitimate reason to do that, sounds really fishy to me.  My guess with the permissions and the other untrustworthy appearance of the app is that it's possibly a data miner.  Them again maybe this appis 100% legitimate...  I uninstalled.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie from start to finish. Gives a great understanding and a behind the scenes look at everything that led to the eventual mission.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very good season! Not as good as season two though. Not as suspenseful and I felt that the whole \\" the world is full of zombies\\" was down played but still very good
B001DTUU7A|5.0|Great kids movie.  I'm not a kid but enjoy these types of movies as much or more than my children.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you like the other Angry Birds games you will like this one. We can save the birds from the movie and it has the same play style as the original.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I Love this movie.  Having all these formats in one package is great. I can't wait til the next one comes out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Temple Run was easier for me to guide. The style is the same basic game play but the running and turning seemed easier to me. Good game that keeps me interested.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is my &#34;go to&#34; game when I just don't feel like thinking about what I'm doing.  Would recommend it.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I like the artwork in this game and I love how easily it handles. I prefer this version over the original 2 Temple Run games because it seems easier to control. There are goals to work towards and it gives me something to work towards if I am bored.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was great entertainment especially for middle schooled aged kids.  It's a required reading in the school systems here.
B007JOM7C4|5.0|Almost every song on this album is good...usually when you buy an album there's two or three songs that you really like, but this album there's at least seven or eight songs that rock!!
B000FA675C|5.0|People seem be a bit upset that the book's historical facts are not accurate.Well, it is a  work of fiction. I found it to be very interesting. Highly recommend it.
B007T967X4|4.0|I asked my kids' piano teacher to review this app, as he has more musical savvy than I.  He said he thought it was a good one.
B0031RS894|4.0|Doctor Who lands on Earth at a school for athletes that compete in the Games. He gets involved in a series of murders by electrocutions even before the Sontarans arrive.<br /><br />They are looking for something and wanting to assess the capabilities of Humans. They set up their own versions of the Games where death is the penalties for the losers.<br /><br />The Doctor, the tenth by the way, must save the young athletes, as many as he can anyway, and learn what they are looking for.<br /><br />Not a bad book. A short, quick read in the manner of the early Who novels based on the serials.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|The book was an interesting and fun read, but it seemed a little sophomorish and gossipy.  It made all of our presidents seem less than presidential, not very comforting for an American citizen.  Maybe it is true that they were less than larger-than-life people, but how these two authors in particular would know the motivation behind all of the presidents club actions is beyond me.  I probably wouldn't have finished the book and maybe wouldn't have even started it if it hadn't been chosen as our next book club selection.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I was a teen when this movie came out and thought that Sorcha was the hottest woman ever.<br /><br />What else is there to say? It's Willow. It's a classic.<br /><br />It seems that recent movies have turned some people into fantasy snobs. Unlike today, when being a nerd is cool and mainstream, you had to be a total nerd for seeing this and admitting to liking it. You were better off not discussing this movie outside of your circle of fellow nerds and outcasts. Talking about this movie or about Star Wars outside of this circle was a crime and punishable by having your books knock out of your hands in the hallway. I definitely earned my stripes for this movie.<br /><br />For all of the true nerds who do appreciate this movie, it's finally in HD.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I went with the canon brand after reading reviews on build quality from after market versions.  This grip has the same build quality as the 7d.  When attached it feels like it is part of the camera.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was not expecting to like this show. I honestly only tried it out of a lack of anything else to watch. However, I am thoroughly hooked! This show has so far quite exceeded expectations and I can't wait to watch more episodes.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|This being my 4th upgrade:  The vinyl, 2004 remastered and recently the Original Mono Recording (bought through  Amazon). The Blu-spec CD2 of Bob Dylan's (the Freewheelin..., Bring it all...., Highway 61...., Blonde on Blonde, and Blood on the tracks) was released in Japan last March, to my dismay Amazon com has not listing of the release. Google's search showed a seller of Amazon  which  I used  for the Japanese remastering of  Neil Young Cds,  before the U.S remastered release .<br />I did not know what to expect, to me if it sounds good its worth the purchase. Using both Cd player and Blu ray ( Oppo) player it was a hard call too pick the difference .<br />This is the  closest sound to 24/ 96 bit used bit by  artists like Steven Wilson and what Neil Youngs been talking about.<br />Its worth it!<br />The seller is Cdjapan , also Jimi Hendrix was released on the same format this month.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I am writing this review for all the movies purchased by me from your company. I am always satisfied with great pleasure with every purchased I have made from you. I do wish You had more to offer from the 70's 80's and possible late 60's. I am seeking a movie by Elizabeth Taylor and Carol Burnette. Continue the good work.
B00AYE8C70|2.0|there was too much of an echo/delay for it to work for us.  the call did go through, but our kids couldn't understand us.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book was great. I read it in a matter of 3 days. I love solving mysteries. This book kept me on edge in constant investigation of what was to come to end the story correctly. I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game love trying to beat my friends scores quick colorfull fun blurring by excitement on a free to go mobile scale
B0063IH60K|3.0|I bought this game because I like Solitaire. This version of it doesn't have enough options in my opinion. It's fun to play for about 2-3 hands, but because the options for diversity are limited, I get bored a little more quickly than I thought. If you like straight up Solitaire repetitively, then this might work for you. If not, keep looking.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I delayed watching Downton Abbey so I could watch the entire season in a short time. Like Season 1, Season 2 did not disappoint!
B003B02PEU|4.0|Once again Mr. Grisham has proven to me to be one of the best authors of this generation. This book has everything that we would expect from this author, but with a twist. We're no longer looking at this case from a lawyers point of view, but from the perspective of a small town newspaper owner. The message and theme of this book are clear throughout the tale. Overall, a good book, with an expected outcome. 4/5
B00A5IXI7O|4.0|This movie was excellent for the era in which is was made.  If you can appreciate old movies and suspend judgement about it being &#34;dated&#34; this is a great movie.  Great plot, good acting, interesting mystery.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book and almost everyone  I know has read it. I hope R.J. will write a sequel to Wonder.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I HAVE TRIED THE OTHER APPS  THIS ONE IS THE MOST DETAILED AND EASILY NAVIGATED. HAS HOUR BY HOUR REPORT  FOR YOUR DAY.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I missed Zero Dark Thirty in the theaters and decided to get a copy. I have to say there is nothing at all wrong with [[ASIN:B00B1E6FF8 Zero Dark Thirty (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] as a Blu-Ray. I like the story; it's a great distillation of events and the action really moves right along.<br /><br />No, my beef is with the direction. Kathryn Bigelow did a wonderful job when she directed [[ASIN:B00275EGX8 Hurt Locker [Blu-ray]]]. She should have taken a slightly different approach in ZDT - it's like Bigelow swapped casts and kept on filmin'. Seriously. ZDT is as dry as HL. It worked once very well. Bigelow needed more character depth or better contrast in settings to avoid having ZDT look like more of the same.<br /><br />Zero Dark Thirty DOES feature the great Jessica Chastain as Maya, the CIA analyst who was completely relentless in tracking down Osama bin Laden. Her performance was absolutely flawless. (I particularly like the scene where she screams at her superior at CIA - real rage! Just look at them veins pop in her neck. That girl was seriously P.O.-ed.) I hope this wasn't the role of a lifetime, because Chastain deserves to be rewarded for her work.
B000001EHS|5.0|My boyfriend loved this CD. He had it before but someone stole it so I bought it for him again. Thanks for making him happy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book from John Grisham. The story takes many twists and turns and keeps you wondering until the very end when all is revealed.
B008PZYZH6|5.0|Try it you'll like it.  It was actin packed and kept my interest all the way through it. Thank you
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Initially I was perplexed with many questions about the story and had reservations about the direction it was taking.  As the pages turned I found that I was becoming immersed in the novel and finding myself enjoying the adventure.  The author has a way of keeping you guessing about the outcome and taking a direction that will keep you in suspense.
B00371XIP8|5.0|IF YOU LOVED PART ONE AS MUCH AS I DID,THEN YOU WILL BE THRILLED WITH PART TWO.I LOVE GANGSTER MOVIES INCLUDING THE OLD CAGNEY,RAFT,AND BOGART MOVIES....SO IF YOU LOVE GANGSTER MOVIES YOU WILL LOVE THIS.BOONDOCK SAINTS ARE THE BEST GANGSTER MOVIES EVER.BETTER THEN THE GODFARTHER.YEAH I SAID IT.I KNOW ITS A MOVIE CLASSIC BLAH BLAH BLAH,TAKE AWAY THE THE FAMOUS ACTORS AND I GAURANTEE ITS NOT THE SAME MOVIE.BOONDOCK SAINTS WILL HOLD ITS OWN AGAINST ANY GANGSTER MOVIE.AND IN MY OPINION &#34;THE BEST&#34; GANGSTER MOVIE EVER,AND I PRAY(GET IT) THAT THERES A BOONDOCK SAINTS THREE..YOURS TRULY...BABYLONBRUCE
B00BESKTMG|1.0|I would not recommend for anyone to waste there money on this movie.  The villians looked like they were more concerned with there hair than anything else.  The movie seemed like it wanted to be like kill bill in fight sceenes but fell horribly short
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I'm overwhelmed with how beautifully written this book is. The story is so real and scary and loving and heartbreaking... The book flows so easily. I didn't think such a short book could be so deep. That you could connect with any character enough to really feel any meaningful emotion. I'm in awe, seriously.<br /><br />This story takes us on Mia's journey. She's a 16 year old high school girl, with quirky parents (Kat & Denny), adorable younger brother (Teddy), say it like is best friend (Kim) and rocker boyfriend (Adam). The book start off with us meeting all the characters before the accident and then through Mia's memories we get to know everyone even more and how important they all are to her.  The way the author had put Mia in her \\"limbo\\" state was beautiful. It's sad, but still so beautifully written. I found myself trapped with Mia mesmerized as everything unfolded before her. Needless to say the book was too short, but at the same it wasn't. I wanted more, but what was given was just enough.  Very thankful \\"Where She Went\\" follows.<br /><br />So now I go into Where She Went with gusto. Is Mia alive? What happen??? I have racing questions. And find this book is written in Adam's POV. You won't be disappointed with either of these two books.
1616551100|5.0|one of my favorite sherlock holmes stories. chases illustrations really bring out the gothic mood of a classic supernatural who done it. if you like this, i recommend read the original story and check out more sherlock holmes stories by arther conan doyle!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Let me premise this review with my thoughts on If I Stay, because you just can't read Where She Went without first reading If I Stay.  I read both books in two days. I wish I had the patience of dragging it out, but this story demands your attention and keeps you captivated until the end. Even then you're wishing there's a third book, but you're completely satisfied after the second. It's simply perfect.<br /><br />I'm overwhelmed with how beautifully written this book is. The story is so real and scary and loving and heartbreaking... The book flows so easily. I didn't think such a short book could be so deep. That you could connect with any character enough to really feel any meaningful emotion. I'm in awe, seriously.<br /><br />This story takes us on Mia's journey.

Needless to say the book was too short, but at the same it wasn't. I wanted more, but what was given was just enough.  Very thankful \\"Where She Went\\" follows.<br /><br />So now I go into Where She Went with gusto. Is Mia alive? What happen??? I have racing questions. I'm pleasantly surprised to hear Adam's voice and then I'm crushed to find that Mia and Adam are no longer together. Adam's story speaks just as Mia's from present to past and back again. In his memories we're taken on his journey of the loss of Mia's family, to the loss of her and then to his super stardom to fame.  My heart just breaks for him as he's devastated over loosing Mia's family who he loved as his ownand then finally losing Mia. I find myself just as angry and bitter as he is. What happen? What the heck happen??? They were so in love... What happen???? These words keep echoing in my head as I was reading the first the first chapter. I finally surrendered to the story. The writing is just as beautiful as If I Stay. Gayle Forman tells this story in such a way I was grieving with Adam throughout the book.<br /><br />So Adam is essentially dumped by Mia, goes into hiding for several months, wakes up and decides music is over for him and starts a job as a data entry operator where his Dad works.  When a visit from Kim of all people out of the blue ignites the anger he's been suppressing. In his anger he begins to write music again and brings his band back together. The album is all about his pain, grief, love and loss of Mia. His band becomes super famous; he has a very beautiful actress girlfriend and all the money he could ever want, but he's not happy... Not just, not happy, but down right miserable needing anxiety meds, alcohol and cigarettes to get through life each day. Yeah he's a mess to say the least.<br /><br />It's been years since Adam as seen Mia. So when Adam stumbles upon a concert Mia is preforming in, he decides to secretly sneak in and listen to her music one last time. Mia hears from the crew back stage that the famous Adam Wilde is in the crowd listening. At the end of the concert she sends an usher to ask Adam to join her backstage. So I think, \\"Oh happy days... they're going to reunite and all will be better\\".  Is that really what any reader wants? Well yeah, but no one in real life ever find it that easy and Gayle knows this.<br /><br />We're then taken on Mia journey after the accented and how it effect her. She loved Adam, but needed time. As the story continues I start to fear that maybe, just maybe I'm not going to get my happy ending after all. I start thinking well I guess Adam's gets his closure and they both move on to live happy, successfully lives. I don't like it. I don't want it. But some books I've been reading lately haven't ended with \\"And they live happily ever after\\". So I'm bracing myself for it...<br /><br />You have to read this book to find out how it all ends. You'll be in tears in both books and go on an incredible journey of death, love and life.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching  &#34;The Good Wife&#34; only last year so I decided to look at it from the beginning. What a great show. Season 1 sheds light on the missing info since I came in late.<br /><br />I especially love the fact that since we purchased Amazon PRIME, we are able to download and watch Seasons 1-4 at no additional charge. FANTASTIC!  You cannot go wrong with Amazon Prime.<br /><br />I look forward to watching &#34;The Good Wife&#34; seasons 2-4 next.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Two weeks so far and it seems to do what it is suppposed to.  It is on a kindle and an android phone.  So far so good....
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was quite good, but very sad. Helen Hunt is a remarkable actress and John Hawkes and Macy were fantastic. The movie made you laugh and cry. It was a truly great movie and shed light on a subject that so many people do not want to talk about, the challenges a handicapped person goes through. I am very glad someone thought to bring this subject to the forefront. It is a subject that needs to be discussed.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good read. Kept me engaged from the beginning.  Lacked a little bit at the end, but would recommend to others. I read this because I wanted to see the movie & always prefer to read the book first.  Looking forward to seeing the movie now.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|It's Michael Jackson!  This is the album that put him over the top and made him a super mega star.  What more needs to be said.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love watching current episodes of this show and enjoy being able to watch previous episodes on my Kindle whenever I want.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|Great movie.  Jodie Foster was really good in this movie.  Would recommend this movie to all my  friends.  Great price.
B00632HWOG|5.0|yahoo is the easiest for me to use. It has always been there for me to depend on. It is like an old friend now.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about with this game. I was able play the game in air plane mode with no Internet connection at all. The first island of the game is called &quot;Tutoria&quot; yes because it's instructions on how  to play the game. I turned the volume on my kindle fire down and there was no noise at all coming from the game so I had no problem playing it in a room with sleeping people. I like the game! And since it's free today it's even better! I had a lot of fun playing it and if you are still worried about the internet thing just play in airplane mode. I like it.
B009UZLRJE|4.0|So far there have not been any issues with the blue ray disc's. My only complaint is that one of the cases for the disc's was cracked and broken. I am happy to report that it did not have an effect on that particular disc. This item did arrive rather quickly.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I really liked how the book was structured. It's now a &#34;how-to-become-the-best-ultrarunner&#34; guide, but a very nice and readable story of how Scott became one. Now and then it's filled with vegan recipes and hints for runners. One of the best running books I read.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Morrie is so full of advice that anyone can use. It's simply fantastic!!! Thank you Mitch gor writing this. Bye.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Emily Griffin has done a great job creating a character that, at first, I found myself disliking, and then in the end rooted for as she found her happy place in life.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am so grateful to Dr. Alexander for sharing his amazing experience.  I am so looking forward to life everafter with our precious Lord and Savior!  Wonderful reading!!!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Works well.  The interface is a little cluttered, though, in my opinion, but I'm not sure how that could be improved.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The problem with these books is that you can't stop turning the pages, but at the same time, you don't want to get to the end and have no more to read.  Having all four of them together alleviates that stress somewhat, but you still start to read more slowly the nearer you get to the last page of Book 4.  I have not finished the series yet, but I am enjoying every page.
B00C32R64G|5.0|This album is so addictive. If you love hard rock, you will love this. Buy it. Memorize. Then sing loudly in the shower. Rock hard my friends.
B00BMR5HOO|1.0|I found it rather complicated and not terribly useful.  You can't send a free or paid app back if you don't like it on your Kindle.  But you can banish it to the cloud and that's where this app will stay, along with others that I tried and didn't find terribly useful.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The research Ken Follett has put into this provides a fascinating and compelling background for the also compelling characters in the novel.  I was total engrossed by the events of Pearl Harbor Day and the machinations of the spy networks.  I shall not forget it and look forward to the third in this triology.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|For some reason I cannot resize text properly on my Kindle Fire version of LinkedIn. That's a shame because I use the app contstantly, both to connect with colleages as well as read articles and posts.  The Kindle Fire does not have the high-res screen of the HD version so reading the tiny type is difficult, despite my having sharp eyesight. Hopefully this is something they can fix in future releases.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator works how it should.  the buttons are large and easy to use. will recommend to anyone looking for a calculator app.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|The Veldt and Telemiscommunications are exceptionally beautiful songs that pair well with some of the harder dance beat central songs in this album.
1476733953|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Fast moving.  Thoughtful.  Totally intriguing.  I hope there is more to come.  This vision of the future is disturbing.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Inspiring!  This is a classic.  It arrived in perfect condition and will be part of of our viewing library for years to come.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I am not the usual war/espionage type reader, but this book was very entertaining. I would read more of his works.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case works great. Fits the Kindle just right and is not real heavy. I carry it in my duffel bag, along with other items, and it protects my Kindle very well. Good product!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Hesitated getting this book...unfamiliar with the author, but the price was right so I went with it.  SO GLAD I DID!!  Will be reading everything by this author!
B00846REIS|5.0|Very touching love story. I never wanted to put it down. I can't wait to read the next book. Keep on writing!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This was the biggest downer ever!  Not my idea of entertainment to watch people fight.  How did this make it into production?<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|While it was okay for a movie, it did not meet the standards of the first Ghost Rider. It didn't even follow the same story line. It wasn't worth the money if you are looking for a sequel. The product itself was fine but the story was limp.
B00062IVKI|5.0|really enjoy the dvd as something different.  recommend it for everyone to see at least once.  well done, interesting to see the stars in such a different piece
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Not much of a plot and so so acting.  Action sequences are ok, there's just not as many as I imagined based on previews.
B007REV4YI|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed the Movie this time around.We would buy more movies of James Bond when they are available.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything is so WELL DONE!  The characters, actors, story lines and location all very top notch! I just started watching season 1 by the recommendation of a friend, and quickly became completely enchanted and hooked!  How lucky we are to be able to go back and at our leisure, watch 3 seasons of a fantastic show, in order, whenever we want!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Great music , great sound, a must have for Rush fans. Amusing video inserts without total interruption to the concert.
B00479SVBU|5.0|The sound quality is a little better then your average transmitter. I haven't really use the remote because I lost it but you don't even need it really, I love it.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|It is very long but interesting. I can visualize this in another life.  What a life these people lived.  Wow!  A lot of research for someone. It is obvious that faith, belief,and honor wins out for success.  I was surprised that all the characters did not come together but it was incredible that so many different cultures were presented and so many revealations were made.  I wanted the story to continue.  Maybe one day it will.  I think it does continue today but I would like some in-between.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|With Google Reader being sunset this July I needed an alternative for my various feeds I read everyday multiple times a day. What attracted me most was when Google does pull the plug the transition away will be seamless and I don't relish trying to update, export, organize my 100 plus feeds again (did that once when Bloglines went down) The app is fast, responsive and visually appealing and they are taking suggestions on improvements as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked the book but... it leaves off on an cliff hanger now I got to get the second book!!!!:)
B00594XOZU|5.0|Like some if the other reviews have said it is very fast! There will never be anything like it! Get it. You will regret it If you don't
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Seriously I use this app for everything. If you wanna write down ideas for a book or pen short stories, roleplay with your friends, have a book of goals and plans for the year, jot down account info- whatever you use composition books for this is the perfect app. I have like 12 journals started with hundreds of pages. I started a poetry book, a notebook, to-do book, script book, etc. If you buy a lot of journals this is a paper free and money saving way of writing. You have the option of lined and unlined pages and page colors and book covers also how many pages you want in your book. You can save these as odds and tons of other options are always present at the bottom. I highly recommend this app for anyone with a kindle or compatible device.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|i looked forward to seeing this movie, since i enjoyed the Burroughs stories so much when i was a kid.  The most important element of the stories, to me, was the the main character.  Maybe that SHOULD go without saying.  After all, stories of this sort are about heroes, however unrealistic those heroes may be.<br /><br />Sadly, whoever put this together did not share that view.  The character presented here as John Carter is a long sad distance from the Warlord of Mars.<br /><br />I could say that the Disney guy is introduced as a drifting, confused slob on the run after the Civil War rather than the proud, disciplined Virginia captain Burroughs created.  I could say that the Disney guy stumbles around in confusion much of this movie rather than acting, as John Carter would act, as a dynamic and intelligent leader in any situation.  Those are true things of course.<br /><br />But to define the total failure of this movie most concisely i should simply point out a single scene, in which the Disney guy allows Dejah Thoris to stand between him and an attacking enemy.  That's right - he places a woman in danger!<br /><br />John Carter would be disgusted by such an act - and astounded: the possibility would never enter his mind.  He would act without thinking to protect any threatened woman, let alone his princess, the Princess of Mars.<br /><br />Chivalry, honesty, resource, unblinking courage, and implacable ferocity define the character Burroughs created and give the series of Barsoom books a timeless quality, however unreal.  The Disney guy fails utterly to present any of those qualities and makes the movie a meaningless babble of activities.<br /><br />I felt depressed after seeing this movie, and the box office tells me i was not the only one.<br /><br />I say give this dog a miss and pick up a copy of The Princess of Mars or the Gods of Mars.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
1616550414|5.0|I was very happy with this product and the amount of time it took for me to recive it.  I will reorder it again
0142402753|5.0|Good moral in the story about being kind is more important than material things.  We all love the story, adults and kids. I would recommend for preschoolers..
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I thought the first book was a little boggy & hard to get into -- I really enjoyed this one!  Good character development, less civil war flashbacks, and lots of excitement.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Audrey Hepburn at her best!! They just dont make films like this classic anymore! As a lover of this genre, this is one of my very favorites! I can watch this one over and over!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I absolutely love this series and would recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it. I typically do not like horror or \\"gore-y\\" kinds of shows or movies; however, this series has such a good story, you cannot help but love it and most of the characters.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|DISCS CAME IN NEW CONDITION... and I FINALLY was able to WATCH ALL THE FILMS IN SUCCESSION...I'm an avid fan of the books but the movies all did justice to the series
B001AW156U|1.0|The product sold to me wasn't what I seen online.The item I received didn't come in original packaging.It came in little glad bags.The product doesn't stay attached to controller.It constantly pops off.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|What a glorious romp through the turn of the century with music, love, & comdey! Shirely Jones & Robert preston have great chemistry. Ron Howard is adorable!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I loved this game I couldn't put it down , it didn't need any thinking about you just relaxed and played. Good for Someone like me who is older and needs to relax more in her life.
B000SJDW3A|5.0|This album is one of the greatest and to play it on vinyl is icing on the cake anyone who likes rock should give this a try.
0786958731|5.0|I'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D&D board game that was a non cooperative game. It was fun. This game was so much more fun because we were all working together. It was hard. We barely completed the quest. My character had to be healed, another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown. A few more turns and we would have lost. That was the easiest one. I do admit we made a few mistakes. I played the solo a few times and either didn't make it or barely made it. This is definitely a challenging game. The game itself is very well made and durable. This is definitely a five star game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|WOW!!!  This movie was execellent. I now own all 4 of Sherwood Churches movies and they just keep getting better. I can,t wait for the next one. What I want to know is if they can make movies like this that don't have all the swearing and sex in them but have humor, family morals and are generally great movies on a low budget then why can't main stream movie makers. I would recomend this movie to everyone who would like to watch a great movie with their whole family.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|My husband and i love the show we always watch it together. It was a good price to buy on line compare to the stores
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I didn't take the time to even read a summary for this memoir when a friend recommended it via Facebook status and I was very inspired reading Cheryl's memoir. Her story is real. She gets lost in life but finds herself through a solo journey. Her alone time allows her to find herself.
B00005BJPO|5.0|I loved it. And it came sooner than expected. Thank you. I will enjoy this collectors item and hope to get the blu ray version as well. Thanks again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book. A great mystery with an unforgettable ending. Have recommended this to all of my friends as a fun and exciting read.
B004NELBPC|5.0|Updated review!<br /><br />The latest interface update was crappy, but they added a 'list' format which pretty much  makes it look like it used to. Just hit settings, choose 'list' instead of 'grid' and then you're set.<br /><br />I actually sent them an email over this, and they got back to me -- not with a canned 'Thank-you-for-your-feedback-' message either! In today's age, to have a personalized response to feedback is nothing but downright staggering.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my family, quality was very good and the easy way to access the movie made my afternoon very pleasant. Thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I started watching Downton Abbey from the beginning this year.  We have now watched all of season 1, all of season 2 and have nearly finished season 3.  We are not big TV watchers- we tend to prefer movies, especially independent movies - but have gotten completely hooked on Downton Abbey.  We will be sad when we finish the last episode that we have to wait until next season to see more.
B006DGOV9Q|5.0|this is genuine battery indeed - surprise! i had troubles with other batteries merchants.<br />this one is excellent, great quality, great retention time, great everything.<br />i am glad i found these guys who do not sell some kind of fraud or generics...
B00BESJYAY|5.0|A well executed story. Found myself wondering how on earth they filmed some of those beautiful and once in a lifetime shots. Portrays Santa Cruz pretty well. I lived there and Jay's experience could be likened to anyone who tries to pull out of the culture there but still stay. I really was touched by many aspects of this film. If you have any love for surfing, The sea, or Santa Cruz, do yourself a favor and watch this.
0143113100|5.0|Great price for new book and service was prompt for the regular delivery. Cant say anything about the contents of the book as my professor has not required the class to read just yet but the YouTube's of author are profound.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|You have to watch this movie for it's own merits. The variations from the original help to bring it into the new millennium. Dennis Quaid gave a great performance as the preacher.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I thin this game is fun and it is not as dumb as a lot of the other games that are dumb. And I only need to use one finger!
B005HJWWW8|2.0|This cute little device is just about useless.  It may increase the volume by &#34;1&#34; click on your volume dial.
030758836X|2.0|I really wanted to like this book as it has many good reviews and has been a bestseller.  However, in the end, I just did not like it.  The book was well-written and had an original story, but the two main characters did not have one redeeming quality between the two of them so they were hard to like or even care about.  I almost found it to be a chore to read the last part of the book.  But I did finish it because it was like watching a train wreck, I needed to see what happened.  The ending was terrible, and I asked myself why I wasted my time reading this book.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Never could get it to play.  I tried downloading, instant, windows media player, amazon unbox.  I played other amazon videos, but this one would not work.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great book... Had lots of twist and keeps you on your toes the whole time. Loved the mystery behind it!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Yes, you have to pay attention to follow all the story lines.  What else are you doing?  Give it a try.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Had seen bits and clips and finally watched the movie, was really great. Must get it in HD though since its black and white otherwise todays TV's make it too pixelated.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love the series.  Without the DVD I would not be able to see it when I am free from commitments and have the time to enjoy it.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Very slow moving story line, enough movement to keep me interested, but not something I'm sure I would recommend to a friend. The ending was definitely worth the time invested. The most interesting parts, to me, were Jamie's boyhood memories from the orphanage, and I would have liked to read a bit more about his experiences and feelings once he was adopted. Flawed characters well written make you care about them, but, as I said, slow moving plot just makes it a so/so in my estimation.
B00BHMF578|4.0|A little heavy on the gum't apparachiks who are stereotypically portrayed as morons and the Iranian's on the trail as dittos - but otherwise pretty good.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I used this charger, not knowing the difference from one to another and to my surprise, there is difference in power. I went on a hour long road trip, my battery was at 22%, when I arrived at my destination the percentage of charge on my battery was up to 64%. There are two usb ports, one for android and apple. These ports are optimized for each os, but will charge any device in either port. This is the best car charger I have owned simply because it charges faster.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book held out hope for those of use who are not active in our faith. That we will meet with those who have gone on ahead.
0385344228|5.0|This book was amazing. Bought it fo a book club and loved the entire story. Once you think you have it figured out the story changes in an unexpected way. The book itself was used but in great condition.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I'm a big fan of Phil Colins and when I see Amazon had his whole album for $2.99 I had to buy it. The album didn't dissapoint at all, and it was well worth the  $2.99 that I  spend. I love every single song on this Phil Colins \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. I played them over and over on my Ipod  because these songs are classic. All the songs on the album are hits and has reached number 1 or are in the top 20 on the billboard charts .  The selection of songs  are great. Althought I love all the songs on the album, I do have my favorites. My five favorite songs are \\"Take A Good Look At Me Now\\", \\"Another Day In Paridise\\", \\"Sussudio\\", \\"One More Night\\"  and  \\"Two Hearts\\".  Overall this is a great album and if you are a huge Phil Collins fan,  you should get this album. I  guarantee you will not be disappointed.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I am a huge fan of the LOTR and Hobbit books as well as the first three movies.  The movie is beautiful, the effects are great and the acting is terrific.  However, the movie is way too long and takes a few too many liberties.  At this point, it's difficult too imagine how the story can be expanded into two more, near three hour films.  Nevertheless, I hope the next two are fantastic!
B001UGB1X8|1.0|we kept watching thinking it was gonna pick up any time now.......... nope just stayed very monotone and Boring. very very Boring movie. we both felt like we wasted a good Saturday nite movie night. We thought oooooooo Tommy Lee......this has got to be the worst movie he ever did. very disappointed<br />.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult is an excellent writer and she always manages to tell a story which has some importance - and she does this with great understanding and sympathy. It is a story about close neighbours who become friends and whose children grow up together. I shall not spoil the story - it is a good story with a lot of family involvements and an engrossing read. This is perhaps one of Jodi's best stories that I have read so far.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie stands a weak second to Zero Dark Thirty in my opinion when it comes to the Oscar awards.  Too much of Ben Affleck's face in the same way we get too much of Tom Cruise in his movies.  At least Cruise has more facial expressions.  Affleck is a wooden actor and unexciting for me to watch.  The story could have been a lot of fun.
B009YX02T8|5.0|Great music! A little bit 'busy' music and a bit of relax... Have the others as well. I love this music!
0062200909|5.0|It's fascinating to see all the work, idea development and pure unbridled imagination that went into developing the 'looks' for each character in The Hobbit. THe drawings are lifelike, almost like photos. My kids and are are big fans of Tolkein, so it's been satisfying to see such authentic and rich costume and makeup creations for the various characters.  If you want to see how Thorin or Kili or Bombur or even good ole Bilbo ended up looking the way each did in the movie, this is a real treat for you.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|I fell in love with the movies and music from them! Have the whole collection now! Great for this mom!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Good for A little older girls.  Eight and up I think.  Not sure boys would love it although lots of action in it.
B001EC2IV2|4.0|Though without all the high tech movie effect compared to today's standard. The story is very good, which will grab your attention.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This has to be one of, if not the best, James Bond movies ever made. With the exception of just a very few minutes this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was a terrific addition to this series.  It kept me interested and the plots were very exciting.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B003Y5H4YI|5.0|Helen Mirren and all of the others in this great film are fantastic. This movie does some timeshifting between the time when the team tracked down and captured and then lost the Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel, the feared Surgeon of Birkenau, in East Berlin and the late 90’s when the score was finally settled. The closing scene will have you white-knucked while holding onto your chair. Think of movie endings like the following—only much more intense:<br />Batman Begins<br />The Silence of the Lambs<br />Carrie<br />The Usual Suspects<br />Casablanca<br />The Godfather<br />Boogie Nights<br />Rosemary’s Baby<br />Bonnie and Clyde<br />Planet of the Apes<br />Se7en<br />Fight Club<br />and...<br />Dr Strangelove
B0018QCXH8|1.0|This is a very boring movie. Do not spend ur money. It starts out very interesting then dies with boredom. I think this movie could have been done much better.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Excellent songs that lend a cinematic frame to the movie. However, the songs are great singles to listen to as well. This is Tarantino's best soundtrack to date.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great movie and my son love it. It kept my son busy during a long plane ride.  Love the music
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and very addicting.  There is always a challenge and love trying to solve the different puzzles.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down.  I needed to see the outcome......and I was surprised but also sad. Good read.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|This one had too much repetition - going back and forth between the same places, not finding anything new. At some point I just got frustrated that I was going back to the same place yet again just to trigger a new hidden object mini game.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved this movie! It had the great characters and heart that Pixar always brings to its films and also had some nostalgia thrown in there for good measure for those of us who grew up on the video games they portrayed. Great film. Would watch it again and again.
B00BM1AJIO|3.0|This game is really well done, but it lacks some of the best parts of similar games:<br />1. It's shorter than the other games<br />2. The many mini game format takes away from the overall story line<br />3. It's way more expensive than the other games and not worth the extra cost.<br /><br />However:<br />1. The user interface is really strong<br />2. The closing of locations is really helpful.
0446580848|1.0|Nelson, Nelson, what has happened? Like others, I have been a fan, and I have listened to nearly every book written by Mr. DeMille (I am audio book guy). Two of my favorites are Mayday and The Lion. This one is, unfortunately, not in the league of those, and it's 19 discs long. Even the fine narration by Scott Brick can save it. I don't understand what happened. I think maybe the author has begun to believe his own press releases, always a mistake because you also start believing that you can write anything and people will like it. I saw this happen to John Grisham as well. His early books were fun and intriguing. His later books not so much.<br /><br />The bad guy in this one is The Panther, a Muslim jihadist born in America, who has decided Americans and Europeans should be killed, for who knows what reason. Unfortunately, given how long the book is, we are given exactly two sections where the panther is involved in any action whatsoever--and he's basically presented as a psychopath. So how are we to really build a visceral dislike for Mr. Panther if there is so little space given to him as the title character? In The Lion, we read about the bad guy doing lots of dirty deeds that provoke us emotionally, and we really want to see him get his due. And another thing, in this one, John Corey never, and I mean never, makes a remark without enhancing it with some smart alec comment. Occasionally, they are funny. Leave those in. But the rest of them got very tiresome and in the way of the story, what there is of it. Basically, the book is a set of not very interesting nor intriguing episodes about Corey and a few others trying to find and kill the panther. Killing people Corey doesn't like is always his first choice, by the way. Human life to Corey is cheap.<br /><br />One of the things that makes thrillers work is that the bad guy keeps outsmarting the good guys several times until you almost lose hope of the bad guy getting what's coming to him. In this book, there wasthis plan to kill the panther, which is introduced about half way through the book or so. The rest of the book is essentially carrying out that plan, such as it is, with nary a word about what the panther is up to during this time or how he might avoid getting caught. At the end, there is a little action of this sort, but not much, and what there is pretty unimaginative.<br /><br />If you liked some of DeMille's earlier books, leave this one alone. It will just disappoint and perhaps color your judgment of those earlier titles. At the end, the author acknowledges various people, including people at his publisher, who read and edited his manuscript. I can't believe that a good editor at any publisher would let some of the stuff in this book go as is. Don't waste (and I use that word advisedly and with regret) your time on this one.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This was my introduction to the hidden object story game. I felt like the map was very helpful, the hints led to the right places - my only improvement would be to make the mini games a little more challenging.
B00991TCOG|4.0|Awesome Cd! Its Violin music with some techno beat. My only complaint is that when I got the Cd the thing to hold the Cd in place was broke and it was sliding around. It might have been the local Mailman but Amazon could have packed it better. But all in all I love this purchase and would buy it again.
B005MLP91C|5.0|They watch it about 2 times a week.  My kids are a 6yo girl and 3yo boy - and it is one of the movies they will actually watch together it is great
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed the instant connection that both characters had right off the bat.  Loved the ending & can't wait for more.
B005PK553C|1.0|I don't know how it was downloaded but it was and now it is stuck on my daughters kindle - awful
B005LAIH3G|5.0|There have been a lot of attempts to bring John Carter to life on screen. Most have been incredibly horrible. To the point that when \\"John Carter\\" came out at the theaters, I foolishly chose to wait for video. I regreted that decision within about fifteen minutes of watching this on my TV at home.<br /><br />It's a beautiful movie.<br /><br />For one, it has great imagery. Wide open vistas- on Earth and Mars. It's also excellently made. No cheese at all in anything. The animation, the costumes, props locations... it reeks big budget movie.<br /><br />It's every bit as beautiful as Sherlock Holmes, and has a far more interesting story than Avatar. Why this film didn't do better at the box office clearly has to do with the idiotic marketing at Disney- like changing the title from \\"Princess of Mars\\" (the title of the book this is based on) to \\"John Carter of Mars\\" to dropping the \\"of Mars\\"... but leaving the symbol JCM for the movie!!!<br /><br />Anyway, here's the nutshell version. John Carter is a Civil War veteran turned treasure hunter, scouring the west for gold. He gets more than he bargained for when he ends up transported to Mars, and finds himself in the midst of a civil war between the human-looking inhabitants. Luckily for him, the natives (very tall, four-armed creature) take him in and show him the ways of Mars. Things really pick up when he saves he life of a gorgeous, no, make that GORGEOUS Martian princess. In the end he saves the day and wins the girl.<br /><br />And I want a sequel.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Titanic or Avatar, then you probably wouldn't like John Carter- it's a far better movie.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|This whole show is 5 stars, hands down! I was a little disappointed with the death and fallout of a major character, but they played it well.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Feel good Disney ending? Bring it on! Worthy heroes and realistic heroines. I'll read this one again! Great cultural references, solid story and believable characters. So sweet you'll get a toothache!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After watching the first couple of episodes of the first season, I was drawn in. The first season left open so many possibilities, while the second season took it down a notch and focused on character development and relationships. As of right now, I am through about 9 episodes of season 3 and I must say, wow! It is back to back action, and the story is simply awesome. I would love to see how season 4 will be able to top season 3!
B003THHIEM|5.0|Kind of like a mix between White Collar and Murdock Mysteries. Fiction yes, but shows what can happen when you utilize the combined talents of a variety of talented people.  Our government could learn a couple of things!
0811879542|5.0|What a clever clever book!  Like an ipad, only it's a book!! My adult computer-geek friends were as fascinated by the kids I read this to at circle time in preschool. Great for participation in group readings.  There shoudl a be a big book version for school. Check out the youtube clips of kids reading this the first time.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I added this to my QNAP 569 pro to add capability and throughput. I havent hit a ceiling with my NAS, and dont expect to.
B0089J29C6|5.0|I have only seen this movie on a 16mm film chain or video tape.  This fabulous 5.1 blue ray is amazing.  Its just<br />like it must have been in a premium movie theater in 1955 with a magnetic print.  Don't even think about<br />it, STOP NOW AND ORDER IT!  You will love this.  Even your strange teenagers will appreciate the production<br />values.  This was the first CinemaScope film in the can in 1953, but Fox wanted &#34;The Robe&#34; released first as<br />a prestige picture.  This poor woman had such talent and beauty.  But wait!  That's not all.  If you order your<br />copy RIGHT NOW, you will have this as an heirloom to leave to your rotten kids in fifty years.  There are only<br />a few copies available.  One of them is for you.  Just do it!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Excellent movie. I love the opening sequence. The action and suspence were perfect. I can't wait for the other two to come out.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Ms. Fey's statements support my theory that successful people require less sleep than the average person. She describes late night writing sessions where she goes to bed at 1:00 AM and has to wake up at 5:30 AM. She nods off at a meeting, but her understanding staffers wait until she wakes up. Just the idea that she was able to get her head off the pillow astounds me. She also exhibits some symptoms of the common female ailment, body dysmorphic disorder, in that she constantly disparages her looks: shark eyes, pasty thighs, round hips, brown hair. Come on, Tina. You're gorgeous. Her early association with the gay community is heartwarming, until she realizes that gays actually want to sleep together when a pair of her friends start making out in front of her. Blechh! Overall the book is very funny and Ms. Fey seems almost ordinary. One of us. Since I require 12 hours of beauty sleep a night, I know she's nothing like me.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Fey for writing this book and letting us into your life. I enjoyed reading it, but your doctor's right. Get some sleep!
6305428050|5.0|The first and most awesome movie of Elisabeth Shue I have seen. &#34;Don't f%@# with the babysitter!&#34; Best line ever!!
B00C10N3EW|5.0|I've never heard of Joe Bonamassa until I saw this concert on PBS. I loved it!!!!!! The next day I bought the CD on Amazon and it is amazing!!! I will be buying more of his albums.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Different and quite interesting!  I never liked a bad guy as much as Vic Mackey. Steal from the bad guys while putting them away in jail. The Mafia does it all the time and people romanticize and idolize those jerks!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Like many of Brian Sanderson's works, The Way of Kings begins very slowly with lots of flashbacks. However, this is a story that is worth waiting on. With it Mr. Sanderson builds his characters to a fullness that allows you to picture them oh so well. He describes the world perhaps a tad less well but it comes through none the less. He describes the societies viewing its inequities without embellishment or embarrassment. The ending chapters pay off the slow beginning and still leaves the reader with questions yet to be revealed.. Bravo.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was a gift for a young girl for whom two of life's greatest loves are Minecraft and Lego.  It was a match made in Heaven, and it is still the focus of her attention.
B008602KQI|5.0|One of my favorite books done VERY well. Even if you had not read the book, you could find your way in this exciting interpretation of the book and look forward to the next edition. Order from Amazon and enjoy - one of the best ways to see the movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie kept my interest from beginning to end.  It was one of those sit at the edge of your seat type movies.  Loved it!
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It's OK for a match 3 game, but in some segments you get stuck for a while. Tokens earned don't carry over to the next round, so they're lost for the next puzzle. Many of the reviews say it's a lot like Call to Atlantis, but I don't like this one NEAR as much.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I really like this watch.  I think the green face looks great.  It has an throwback military look to it, something you'd see back during WWll. The strap is ok but i'm going to change it to a brown leather strap.  So far it keeps time perfectly.  Others have mentioned its really loud movement but I don't think its to bad.  Sure you can hear it move when its quiet or it swings a full arch but just normal movement I don't even notice it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you love a thinking game,you want this.If you love a challenge, you want this.It's a very rewarding feeling to find your next clue in this game.I love the flow of the screen,the subtle hints,and the graphics are great.So go ahead and get it so they'll start building the next great puzzle because I hate waiting.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|great exercise programme, very motivational, really like doing the exercise, just have to keep up the motivation now, its good.
0802473156|5.0|This is an excellent book! Should be read by every married couple whether you are having problems in your marriage or not.  A must read!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book so much! August is so inspiring and all of the others too! I couldn't stop reading this book! At some points it was very sad and upsetting but it was  very happy at the end. It teaches u that bullying has many consequences. I just love  this book so much I am so sad it's over): I wish there were more books like wonder!
0920668372|5.0|I love that book and I've had to read it over and over again. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. It touch my heart every time I read it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's so cool  I mean this is so for real and I love animals so much more than books
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This  book was a joy to read. I laughed and cried. Hard to imagine things went on in  the orphanages not that long ago but there were so many sweet characters in other chapters. I almost hated to finish the book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|there have been many good sci-fi shows on broadcast television over the years, but since the Xfiles in the 90's, not a whole lot have lasted a full season (let alone 5) this is one of the best but you honestly cant pick up in the middle. you have to start at the beginning and going back to the start has been wonderful. I think Walter Bishop may be one of my favorite television characters of all time except perhaps for archie bunker.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It doesn't take long to get drawn into this book. There is much to reflect on in regards to relationships....marriage....public perception...
B008WHTFL8|5.0|You get what you think you're gonna get.  Pure Rock Madness.  Awesome album from the band that has saved rock and roll.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is an amazing book book and  I would recommend to anyone who wants a great and interesting book to read. The way Jane Austen wrote this book is amazing and I would give it 5 stars.:)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recently watched all three seasons of Downton Abbey. This was absolutely wonderful stuff!  Well written and acted, I can't wait for next season!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Asie from some minor streaming issues (my wifi is also iffy so it may have been that) this purchase has been just awesome. The audio/vide quality is great, and the controls are large enough that I can navigate the timeline of the episode easily if I need to. It resumes from where I left off when I come back which is also something I like.<br />The show itself is GREAT! As a &#34;classic TV geek&#34; (Doctor Who/Sherlock/Lord of the Rings etc) fan, this show really appealed, and this gives me a forum to make it my next big addiction because I can watch it anywhere (on any mobile device) so that's fun. The app generally functions well (although you actually have to download stuff if you want to watch it in an area where there's no wifi) but basically it does the job. I wish they had this show on netflix/hulu so I could stream it anywhere but oh well.<br />ANYWAY! Plot line is great. Dramatic and engaging, and very character-driven. The acting is superb, and the plot takes many unexpected twists etc. I'd totally recommend it to anyone who wants an engaging, addicting show!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a very interesting and compelling drama.  I watch one after the other and I have a hard time closing the next episode.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I recently broke my pevis in Feb.. My parents owned a Kindle Fire and they let me use it while I was recooperating.  They noticed that I was addicted in playing with it so much that they actually purchased one for me for my upcoming birthday. I love it.
B005Z28M58|5.0|I finally got the final season.<br /><br />I am not happy that the show ended BUT I have the entire set to enjoy over & over.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|When those little devices are lost in the abyss of those over crowded backpacks, out comes my little app to help and save the day. Really cool product.
B00684J49U|5.0|I love this show.  It has kept me interested so far.  We will see what happends after all the changes
0316044938|4.0|Despite gruesome themes (rape, serial killer), this book is a rather lightweight read. It touches on many interesting themes - love, death, afterlife, forgiveness, and many others, without really delving too deep into any. I think its attempt to present \\"heaven\\" was pretty lame, perhaps not surprisingly so, since the author has no \\"defined religious practices,\\" as she says in an interview, and which I read as limited (at best) spirituality. I'm not saying this is wrong. Actually, I find it refreshing that someone can treat the death and hurt in a compassionate way without overbearing religious perspective. It is just that the way heaven is presented is not very interesting, and rather childish.<br />An idea I found interesting was the resolution of the \\"crime/mystery\\" aspect - \\"will he be caught?\\" I don't want to spoil the ending, so let me just say that I liked the anticlimactic way this is resolved.<br />The slight disappointment came from the slow middle part of the novel, which gets bogged down in passing years, and stories about all characters, bordering on a soap opera.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Great book, can't wait for the sequel to come out, I've already preordered it.  Love all the  old pictures and the story line.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book gives a very frank and straightforward approach to analyzing and writing screenplays!  The language is simple and the examples are very telling.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|didnt work right not pleased!!! couldnt install on my tablet. didnt sync up right. ended up getting a different product.
B002RVCD6O|3.0|I had originally watched this movie about a year after it originally came out. As I'm now listening to the audio book (5 stars there, especially for Jim Dale, the narrator), I thought I re-watch it as frankly I couldn't remember much about it except the end.<br /><br />I now know why. The full book contains so much detail that it's hard to see how to cram it into a 2 hour movie, and it shows. I failed to feel any sense of &#34;flow&#34; through the movie. It jumps so quickly from scene to scene that it feels like a montage of vignettes, not a story. This hurts any immersion into it, which is why it ends up being forgettable if you haven't read the books.<br /><br />I won't quibble with what was cut or changed as such is rather inevitable with trying to condense a large book into what has to be essentially a novella in length for a movie. In fact, it probably needed to be very aggressively trimmed down some more. Now with the hindsight of what the end of the series was, it probably could be done much better now.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|This movie had great potential. It starts strong and the story sucks you in. Then it falls flat. It is the beginning of a new story so that may be forgiveable. It is beautiful on screen and score is amazing. It has the feel of the original Alien movies. I would have given it three stars, but the feeling of nestalgia earned it an extra star. Looking forward to the sequel.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Saw this game recommended in PCworld magazine.  Got it for my wife, and she cant stop playing,  great music.<br />And cool zombies
B0049J2CKE|5.0|My daughter literally loves this movie and has watched it about 50 times already. She thinks it's hilarious. 5 stars because my kiddos loves it
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of the best musicals of all time and I felt the movie did it full justice.  Moving portrayals and beautiful photography combine to make an exceptional musical experience.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|This movie was terrible neither of the kids enjoyed it and it was rather boring. So Glad I didn't see this is the theater
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Unrealistic scenarios with mostly negative relationships<br />The negative vibe outweighs the positive and funny<br />Much too long for the mediocrity of it (2 hrs 20 min!)
B0052AC8C6|1.0|This has to be the worst movie Johnny deep has ever made! It was long and very boring!!! never again
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|maybe this is not as good as 'brand new eyes' but they still do great songs, i'm loving it so far!
B004UPANGM|5.0|I've seen all of the original \\"Evil Dead\\" movies, and feel this is the best of them all. How to describe it?  Let's call it a bizarre hybrid of \\"The 3 Stooges\\" movies and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" with Ray Harryhausen-like special effects thrown into the mix.  This movie may not be great for the entire family, as the little ones could get scared. But then again, that's what a horror movie is all about, isn't it?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I highly recommend this game it's sooo fun and i never get sick of it!! I have it on my kindle fire and it's so addicting so if yer looking for a game that's fun and addicting this is the one to get!!! :)))) amazing game!! :) kinda like temple run and temple run 2!! :) i recommend all these games: temple run,temple run 2,and especially SUBWAY SURFERS!!!! :) get it!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Actually, that symbol on Superman's chest -- the one that millions of fans have come to assume means &#34;Superman&#34; since, you know, the beginning of time, stands for something perhaps even greater. And, according to the new trailer for this summer's &#34;Man of Steel,&#34; it's not even an &#34;S&#34; at all.
B0058VW36U|3.0|This game is pretty fun and cute but there's just like one flaw that........... it's wat to HARDD (with 2 D's) it's pretty easy at first but then it just gets wayy way to hard!! Honestly it actually gets kinda stressful!..but other then that BIG flaw!! It's fun and cute and ya all that stuff but just my opinion i wouldn't get it if im not super good at game's. :) soo ya! But it was kinda worth it when i got it cause it was free but now it costs money!!! Not worth any money just DON'T buy iad they'll make it FREE again
B008602KQI|5.0|Reminds me of the love I have for my sister!! Jennifer Lawrence is an awesome actress....only she could be cast in this part to make it real!!
B008V8FVTI|5.0|really gripping, entertaining movie...Jason Patric was superb....Kevin Bacon was great as the BAD guy ....Dustin Hoffman as usual did a fine job as the stumbling, bumbling genius lawyer and who else could be &#34;Father&#34; but Robert De Niro.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Ok not the best I have read before.  Was time consumer during long air flight. Don't understand whay the hell you need all this.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie.  It is great for kids and adults alike.  We at least watch this movie 3-4 times a week and it still hasn't gotten old.  Make me feel like a kid watching muppets again
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Is a good challenging game.Would recommend to my friends to try for a change of pace.Will look for other games by the same developer.
B008PUXMP2|5.0|I'm in my sixties--not the usual audience for a singer like this, but huge talent always shows, and she had it!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is an easy read and really opens your eyes on the ethics of research.  I work in cancer research and rest assured that patient consent and safety is ALWAYS paramount.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|After reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and loving it, I wanted to read all of Gillian Flynn's work.  I must say &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; was too disturbing for me.  The things the mother and the young girls did... who thinks of these things? I will NOT be reading &#34;Dark Places&#34; without taking an anti-depressant first.
B004OZZ624|3.0|It progresses so slowly. the movie would have been better & more engaging if they cut about 30 minutes from it.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|The first two seasons were good.  The only really satisfying episode in season three was the last one.  It was irritating how irrational and just plain stupid some of the characters were.  I'd still watch it again and plan to purchase season 4.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Bought as a birthday gift for my 12 year old daughter. She plays the violin and has seen some Lindsey Stirling videos on you tube. She was very excited to get this CD!
B009AMANBA|4.0|If you like historical movies this is a good one. Sally Field was great as the Mrs. Lincoln. The movie is a little dark in color but still good.
B0063IH60K|3.0|To me,I love to play solitaire,also,my husband plays a lot as well,however ,I would like it more if there were at least 2 levels.That may not even be possible...if not...I will keep playing and I will get better.....Thanks for checking.....I am not quitting...I will WIN....love it.
0060833459|5.0|Even though this is an older book, the information is extremely relevant. The examples are older, but the decision and goal making processes are classic. A great book on how to be a more effective leader, executive, and decision maker.<br />These principles can be applied to most aspects of life to increase personal effectiveness and get the most out of the time you have.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|A truly incredible story of survival and friendship. Very well written.  A must read for any fan of non-fiction. Simply amazing.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I have loved Brothers In Arms ever since it was used in the Miami Vice episode, &#34;Out Where The Buses Don't Run&#34;.  In addition, there are other great songs on this CD and I love the memories that they bring.
B0068THAGY|5.0|For what the previews made it. The movie held up to the hype. all i can say is im still blown away at how good it actually was
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A techno-geek dream, this story kept me up all night reading.  A realistic tale of planetary survivalism at its best.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|all that i need to hear when it comes to nikki being on top of the rap game and crossingover
0723257639|3.0|The books arrived in Good Condition there is some damage on the top corners of each little book and corresponding indentions on the lid cover.  I am disappointed because they are printed and bound in China.  I am now searching for an older set printed on different paper and bound in England.  The drawings are the same in each of the editions I have seen.
B009R659L8|5.0|MHC has done it again. I don't want to give anything away, so just read it! I get to reading and don't want to stop because I want to know what happens! Excellent book! Enjoy!
1400069742|5.0|This is a masterfully-told story, well-researched and vivid in the telling, of the period when World War II was under way in Europe and Americans were debating what to do. Lynne Olson focuses on the larger-than-life personalities of FDR and Lindbergh, but tells the full story of American political and military steps in the 1939-1941 period. She uses other characters of the day to tell the story: Anne Morrow Lindbergh; Elizabeth Morrow, her mother (and an interventionist); Robert McCormick, Chicago Tribune publisher and a stern isolationist; William Allen White, the leader of the interventionist movement; and Generals George Marshall and \\"Hap\\" Arnold, who played rather-devious roles in the dispute. She tells Wendell Willkie's 1940 presidential candidacy in full. It's remarkable that Olson can tell their stories sympathetically, given the bitterness of the day.<br /><br />It's a book that fills out a pivotal period in which America seriously debated staying out of the war, while FDR began a cold war in the Atlantic with the Germans, using supplies and, more and more, naval skirmishing with the U-boats. The story has more detail on resistance and isolationism among FDR's generals, and even outright leaks, and puts new and darker perspectives on several of them, notably General \\"Hap\\" Arnold, went on to command the wartime USAAF -- but nearly didn't, very nearly sacked because of his intrigues. The author even tells of Hollywood's role in the months prior to US entry into the war.<br /><br />Indispensable for anybody interested in the history of WWII America. This book is a worthy successor to Lynne Olson's \\"Citizens of London.\\" Highest recommendation.
0756655307|5.0|This was a C'mas gift for my son and he LOVED it.  It was a huge book, great illustrations, a must for any Marvel lover!
B000FA675C|5.0|But historically inaccurate. As proved by DNA of Merovingians. the Holy Grail could not be what it is purported to be in the book.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It constantly feels like something is missing X_x can't upload photos to albums... can't manage some of the settings... small yet important details X_x
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Game keeps you wanting to play more. I have been playing for couple months. My kids love it wife hates it says I play to much.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It could be faster, that's something I wouldn't mind... but it does what it's supposed to, and it does it well X_x
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|It was just a poorly done movie. I couldn't even watch the whole thing and I like Keira Nightley.<br />YUCK!
B008Y1NY14|2.0|This is the kind of stuff you expect to see in an ad, not in a book X_x It feels like I'm being sold another book X_x and they tell you that you can upgrade it so you actually are being sold another book... but they don't tell you what the upgrade is about X_x
0345803485|1.0|...don't even bother with this - crap. It is beyond awful. Giving it one star is actually quite generous on my part. I'm glad I waited for the library loaner and I didnt waste any money on it. As for my time, I'll never get that precious hour back. I will never understand why there are any good reviews at all for this book. There was nothing I found interesting, funny, erotic, insightful or valuable. Just spend your money and your time elsewhere, like cleaning your toilets.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|One of the first movies I have watched that has a solid plot from beginning to end. Very well done.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You should just ignore all the people that gave one star, because this is the best book EVER!!!!! Read this book! Also if you have read Out of my Mind by Sharon M. Draper, then you will love love LOVE this book!!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|It did not work on velocity cruz 10 tablet; all the tweaking and troubleshooting was for naught!  I am quite sure it's a fun game, but not for all tablet users. Kudos to Amazon for their quick response.
B004R1Q296|5.0|Since I am writing a story on the 1400s, I was interested in reading this history as a prelude to my understanding of the century before.  Barbara Tuchman is easy to read and well versed in her subject.  I don't like to read histories generally, but this one I really enjoyed.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book was amazing the way count Olaf had treated the Baudelaire children so miserably it made me think of the movie based off this book.
B00352QISI|5.0|Pandorum is a great film! I love it! I am shocked it was never in theaters, I have seen it at least 6 times and have introduced many other folks to this film who love it as well. It's sure to become a cult classic!
B009DJB8I2|5.0|This was an excellent purchase for me, and the music was fantastic.  This is an item of great worth as it is 17 dollars for over 70 fantastic songs.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I didn't know going into this book how amazing it would be. I've never read Ken Follett before and this was a great book for me to start with. I love historical novels and this one hits it's mark! I'm starting on the second book in the trilogy now and I can't wait to see what it brings.
B002ZG999U|5.0|The movie was action packed and family ok. the movie was also funny enjoyed it very much would even watch it again. the disk was like new cover and disk like new.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, sad as it was.  It was an enlightening story that all should read.  We don't want to forget the history from this story.  It's amazing what those persecuted during the Holocaust had to survive.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I FELL IN LOVE WITH TRAVIS AND ABY!!!! What an outstanding story!!!! A must read. One of the best books I read.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I am glad I read this book but really found it so disturbing.  I could not watch the movie what was based upon this novel as it was too sad.  Definitely an interesting perspective by the author.
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved it. hard to put down.  different type of crime novel and a welcome change. looking for her next book. first two were rather dark. this one (third) right on the money.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I always enjoy the quick reading of Nicholas Sparks' books.  They are interesting and light reading.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a pleasant reading experience.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Seriously, I never thought I'd get into it, but there's something about the series I really like.  I'm into vampire movies and these guys ae really not the vampires I grew up with but they kind of have a human feel to them.  Just fun stuff to play on those cold snowy or rainy nights.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|These books were spellbinding.  Excellent writing and definitely worth reading.  It gave me such perspective of a life so different than my own.  Frighteningly real.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This was a fairly well done, insightful book, but there was a little too much SEAL and individual braggadocio.  There's no doubt that they're great warriors, but a little bragging goes a long way.  If you can get by that flaw, then you'll enjoy the book.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was wonderfully written.  I have recommended it to many folks.  It allows us to see how Alzheimer's affects it's victims from a different perspective.  A look at one of the most devastating diseases.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Drama, drama, drama infused with some humor and witty retorts - you have an upper crust show with a healthy layer of real life infused.  I really like the UK version as it seems more complete.  A great show not to be missed!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|As were many others, I was both horrified that this could happen yet thrilled that Jaycee was finally rescued from her captivity.  Reading the story written by Jaycee herself, showed the courage she developed at a very young age.  What an inspiration she is to her children.
B004LWZW42|5.0|We bought this to add to the video library and it has been a pretty popular item since purchased. Great!
B000EWIM8G|4.0|Got here quick and was exactly the book I ordered before this one I ordered the same book for a class and it had to be this edition and they sent me a different edition (different seller not this one) I will order from them again
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|who allows  and green lights  this garbage? i'm with Spike Lee  you can't no pasta  Western where Slavery is the subject matter.  i mean hollywood  allows this garbage alll the time  and why does Tarantino  get  so much joy of having the \\"N\\" word used  all through his movies?  tired of his Al Jolsen approach  and  ride toward  black culture.  i find Tarantino's work overrated, contrived, overblown  and sets  folks back a hundred years.  this film is a  bad  joke.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Light hearted beach read.  Enough excitement and romance to keep you interested but nothing too intense.  Good for light reading
B005ELZNH0|5.0|now obviously this isn't the whole complete sets of the man's work, however it contains enough music that leads you  into his versatile  and uncharted territory where  his  work  would take you.  he truly  flowed with the past, present and went forward.  his  music  as showcased here not only changed from  era to era  however  more like album to album.  incredible concepts and vision.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider solitaire is without a double my very favorite game.  If you really watch what you are doing, you can win this game quite often.  Love this game.
B001QJUX24|4.0|*Spoiler alert* THE SEARCHERS ranks seventh on the list by Sight and Sound, the prestigious British Film Institute journal, of the all-time greatest films.  The Writer's Guild of America includes it on its list of the 101 Greatest Screenplays.  The exceedingly fine first half hour justifies the accolades.  The middle section is lighter in tone and enjoyable.  The final stretch is somewhat spoiled by inconsistency in the main character.  I won't say it doesn't deserve its reputation as a classic, but with qualification.<br /><br />The film opens with a gorgeous interior shot as a woman, seen in silhouette, opens the front door of her frontier cabin to a breathtaking view of Monument Valley.  The film consistently rewards the viewer with its visual magnificence.  (The story takes place in Texas, whereas Monument Valley is in Arizona, but only a purist would object to that inaccuracy, given the splendor of the scenery that cinematographer Winton Hoch serves up.)  The year is 1868 and the woman is Martha Edwards, opening the door to welcome her brother-in-law Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), a Confederate veteran who is returning to his brother's homestead.  Ethan has secrets.  Where has he been in the three years since the Civil War ended, his family asks, and how did he get those sacks of Yankee gold coins that have not been circulated?  He never answers.  Perhaps the Union cavalry pants he wears are a clue.  Was he a collaborator?  A thief?  We never know.<br /><br />We also become aware, through subtle gestures, of the unspoken passion between Ethan and Martha.  Were they lovers before Ethan went off to the war?  Did she marry his brother in hopes of staying connected to him?  We never find out.<br /><br />Ethan greets the children and seems to have a special affection for the littlest one, Debbie (played by Lana Wood.  Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, will appear later in the picture playing Debbie as a teenager--a nice casting touch).  But the sunny atmosphere growsominous when the family's adopted son, Martin Pawley (an agile Jeffrey Hunter), arrives for dinner.  Ethan pegs him as a half-breed.  Martin tries to deflect Ethan's hostility by explaining he is one eighth Cherokee, and, ahem, please pass the biscuits.  The tension is palpable at the table as the disapproving Ethan glares at Martin.  We never find out why Ethan hates Indians, either.<br /><br />A Comanche chieftain (played by a white actor--here the casting doesn't work) lures Ethan away, kills the family and abducts Debbie.  The raid is heart-rending and filmed with an economy that makes it as scary as a scene out of Hitchcock.  As the family's growing fear is simply conveyed in the way they handle a lamp at dusk, we share their terrified imaginings of what is coming.<br /><br />Ethan sets off to find Debbie.  But there's a twist.  Martin rides with Ethan as an unwelcome deputy.  As other members of the posse disburse, we are left to wonder how these two, the searchers of the title, will handle being together on a long, grueling and dangerous quest.  I was expecting the middle of the film to be a suspenseful cross-country hunt, something like the highly underrated 1968 Western thriller, THE STALKING MOON. While there are some of those elements, the film took a more humorous turn.  Ethan and Martin encounter picaresque Western characters and droll escapades such Martin's accidental acquisition of an Indian wife, the frustration of Martin's sweetheart Laurie (a spirited performance by Vera Miles) over his refusal to settle down, and Martin's fight with Laurie's annoying fiance on her wedding day when she finally determines to marry someone else.<br /><br />What emerges as the heart of THE SEARCHERS is not only the mission to find the missing niece, but the unlikely bond that develops, despite themselves, between hardened tough guy Ethan and tenderfoot Martin, a connection which is deeper than either realizes or could ever bring himself to admit.<br /><br />While thelove between Ethan and Martha is muted at the beginning, it seems powerful.  Yet screenwriter Frank Nugent never refers to it again in Ethan's motivations.  I found it curious how Ethan never indicates any desire for revenge for the killing of Martha, or that her murder further inflames his hatred for Indians.  It might make his racism at least more understandable, and create more sympathy for his character.<br /><br />Word arrives at the wedding that the chief who abducted Debbie has been spotted.  Debbie is now old enough to have been despoiled by her captors.  Martin worries that Ethan might kill her, believing she'd be better off dead than a chieftain's wife.<br /><br />The ambiguity in Ethan's character--we like him for his competence and gritty determination while recognizing the ugliness of his bigotry and violence--spills over into inconsistency when he at last comes face to face with Debbie.  At their first encounter, he does threaten to kill her, but is deflected from doing so first by Martin and then by the arrival of men from her tribe who start shooting.  Later, when the settlers prepare to invade the Comanche camp, Ethan hopes the Comanches will kill her.  During the fight, Ethan again confronts Debbie.  She flees from him in fear, only to have him catch her, lift her in his arms, and tenderly tell her they're going home.  Huh?<br /><br />Was he thinking of Martha at that moment?  Martha makes an anguished gesture toward Debbie at the beginning of the film as she sends Debbie away to hide from the marauding Comanches.  Certainly, it would have meant everything to Martha to know that her daughter was spared and that Ethan rescued her.  Or would it?  Others have said Martha would prefer her daughter dead than a Comanche bride.<br /><br />Ethan remains an enigma.  More insight into his emotions would have made him more consistent and easier to identify with.  Martin, part Cherokee, tries to protect Debbie from the savage attitudes of the whites, and ironically comes across as the most admirable one in the picture.  Today's viewer likely finds it harder to relate to Wayne's racist character as a hero.  But even if we accept the movie on its own terms in the context of its respective times--the mid-1800's frontier as depicted in the sensibilities of 1950's Hollywood--Wayne's character development still seems lacking since we get so little information about what makes him tick.  I suspect THE SEARCHERS would not be nearly as well-regarded today had a less popular Western star, say George O'Brien or Randolph Scott, played Ethan.  The on-screen associations we have with Wayne as the ultimate Western action star make up for a lot of the deficiency in the delineation of the character.<br /><br />Ford's classic themes are found in the film:  the importance of home, the loss of innocence in growing older, the hardship, courage--and injustice--that was required to settle the rugged land that was wrested from the natives.  But the story turns on the character of Ethan, and we need to know more about him.<br /><br />Thus I can't share the opinion that the screenplay is one of the greats, but THE SEARCHERS is engaging, complex, thoughtful, well-acted, and superbly shot with the assurance of a master filmmaker.  It contains generous amounts of the poetry and comedy for which Ford is famous.  The Ford-Wayne partnership is one of the most remarkable in movie history.  John Wayne considered this film his favorite of the 28--count `em, twenty-eight--pictures he and John Ford made together. For that reason alone THE SEARCHERS is a must-see.

0345803493|5.0|I really love this series and can't put the books down.  I really like the passion and erotic love story between Ana & Christian.  It's a great read for mature adults.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I looked at a lot of cases and I love this one!  It's low profile and holds the unit up, as it should.  I dropped it on concrete once.  The unit hit on the corner and was undamaged.  I highly recommend this one.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is not at all what I expected. It's disturbing and I just can't imagine how someone can come up with this story line of people killing eachother like this. At the same time, I couldn't stop reading it, so it accomplished the goal there, but I have absolutely no motivation to continue on in the series.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Good, taut movie with a minimum of gratuitous violence. Seemed to be very plausible based on what we know. Also not overly patriotic. A good watch
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Not really knowing what the story was, my husband and I had watched a non-musical version of it, but I knew that the Broadway play had contained many memorable songs, so I knew I was missing a lot that would have added to my enjoyment. When I got the chance to see this version, it was all I had hoped it would be. I was so surprised that people I didn't know could sing were actually pretty good. The perfomances were impeccable. Great movie.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Having never heard of this movie, we took pot luck and were rewarded with a warm, funny and very human production. Well acted and put together. The subtitled French language did not distract. Thoroughly recommend this for an entertaining watch.
0307720748|3.0|Truly one of the most courageous businessmen of our time. The book is filled with inspirational screw-it-lets-do-it stories of going with your gut. Trying to fly around the world with a hot air balloon or renting a jumbo to form a new airline on a shoestring are just some of the exciting ventures Branson describes.<br /><br />I hoped a bit more insight for the business side of things. There was some crumbs of Branson-way-of-business such as:<br />- employees first - customers second and the profits will come.<br />- Use the brand to venture widely and hedge against market fluctuations instead of the norm of trying to be the global leader at one thing.<br />- Small units keep the motivation when people can see the results of their work<br />of course this was not even supposed to be a business book...<br /><br />The biggest downside of the book was the \\"auto\\" in autobiography. Branson says he is really avoiding confrontation in his human relations - this seems to include himself. It would have been nice to get a glimpse of the dark side of things as well.

1439152799|5.0|This is a guest review from my wonderful daughter-in-law, Jennifer Ohlarik:<br /><br />Kate Morton spins a tale of gothic measure in her 2010 novel, 'The Distant Hours'. Spinster twin sisters, Percy and Saffy Blythe, are living within the ever-dilapidating walls of their once vibrant castle. Since the hauntingly gruesome death of their mother and their father's ultimate mental and physical demise, the elderly sisters are charged with the care of their intrinsically beautiful, yet wild younger sister, Juniper, who possesses the same ethereal and charming characteristics as Coleridge's `Christabel'. It is set in the late 1930's and early 1940's in England during a time of bombings, evacuees, gas masks, and blackouts. At the heart of the story is Raymond Blythe's published work entitled \\"The True History of the Mud Man\\". Raymond was the trio's father. The tale unravels a world of mystery, secrets, and sins committed within the stone and mortar walls of Milderhurst Castle.<br /><br />Edie, a young publisher from London is enraptured by \\"The True History of the Mud Man\\" only later to find out that her mother, Meredith, shares a secret connection to this English Castle and it's inhabitants. As a young girl, Meredith was sequestered to Milderhurst Castle as an evacuee. She grew close to Juniper and learned to write at the hand of Raymond Blythe. The tie between the two elderly sisters; the dominance and submissive parts played by each respective twin, woven and connected to the younger carefree spirit of the wild Juniper is intensely fascinating, as is the strong possessiveness and oppressiveness of the castle walls. Morton tells a story of forbidden love, family loyalty, family ties - or rather chains, which ultimately revolves around this mysterious monster that arises from the mud.<br /><br />This book contains wonderful surprises and revelations that are delivered with gentleness and ease. The plot is multi-layered with a strong foundation.  Page after page, Morton carefully paints a picturesque English countryside and develops characters that are real, with whom we can come to know, understand, and ultimately empathize. It's a story of past and present, with subtle glimmers of hopeful futures. It's nostalgically rich in it's gothic feeling lending the reader's mind to reminisce the Bronte sisters' works. The novel has many references to the great writers and poets. Emerson and Poe are two of the family dogs. It's a warm friend for any reader with strong inclinations towards the world of British classics. Intertwined with mentions of the great writers, Morton also creates humorous charm with her allusions to Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />The Distant Hours is a meticulously crafted story that that entrances the reader until the last page.efully paints a picturesque English countryside and develops characters that are real, with whom we can come to know, understand, and ultimately empathize.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I can't say it enough, I love this movie. I have watched it numerous times on DVD and find things I have missed the last time I watched the movie.  It have caused me to purchase and read the first three books of Burroughs Mars trilogy.  ALL modern SiFi owes a huge debt to Edgar Rice Burroughs and JOHN CARTER.  I can't stress this last statement enough.  Do yourself a favor and purchase JOHN CARTER and enjoy!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I thought the books were well presented and very readable.  My only problem was the ending.  I wanted the love story to go on with the two main characters.  Can't wait for the movie to come out on the last two books.

I would make a list of things I needed to do while running errands and would always forget to bring it with me, but I never forget my phone so I always have my list with me. I love that you can set up reminders, shopping lists or create your own lists. Another great feature is that you can set up tasks to be recurring and set alarms to remind you of important items on your lists. I can also access my wunderlist from my other devices since it syncs them all, and my husband loves that he can add things to it that he needs me to do during the day.

0399226907|3.0|I thought a hard cover book would be better for a preschooler but I was disappointed by the smaller size.  I remember as a child how big the paperback book was in my lap and the joy of putting my finger in the holes of the pages and pretending my finger was the hungry caterpillar eating the leaves.  The holes are so small, I am not even sure a preschooler would have the dexterity to put their small fingers into the holes.  If I saw the book ahead of time, I would have picked the paperback if it was larger.<br /><br />Michelle

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The leading actors performaces were tolerable, at best.  Supportive casting was nearly painful in it's excessive sentimentality crammed into mini-blurbs of screen time.<br />I am not a fan of novel-to-movie adaptations in general and The Hunger Games is no exception.  If you need background noise on while working a project or other entertainment, this film is adequate for that 'filler' in the room.<br />The story or attempted plot is very weak - to presume, 70+ years after a rebellion by the 'disctricts' and the resulting aftermath or working peace (aka &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;), that only ~10% of the districts required participants actually train for the 'games' is a huge black hole in the story and completely unrealistic.  If such a culture ever existed, no self respecting community or family/parents would allow their child(ren) to live such complacent lives and go into such a 'lottery' unprepared.  The premise of the story is based on 'eligable participants' who are between the age of 12 and 18 and are pitted against each other to the death in what is viewed as a game show by those living in the Capitol.<br />Stupid, unintelligent and debasing fluff.

B006UIUJ2A|3.0|I would not recommend you read this book during a dark spell as it is very un-nerving how the people of North Korea live. Even if half of the narrative is true they live under a very strict and domineering dictorshiip.<br />It was not an easy read but in light of the current stand off between North Korea and America it throws invaluable light on their plight. and for this reason am glad I persevered with the book.

B001H1SVO8|1.0|The premise seems to start out all right, but then dissolves into science fiction nonsense and becomes less and less entertaining.  When you read about the actual premise of the book, you understand why it was assigned high ratings, but was not a good product.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|There is not much, if any, of Van Morrison's music that I do not have. Simple put this will become  A Classic. It is Grammy material. In the 1st week I had it I must have listened 40 to 50  times. I just could not get enough of it. From what I know of Morrison he must have drove everybody in the recording sessions crazy because what you have on the CD is pretty close to flawless. This Is the best singing by Morrison I have ever heard. The arrangements are simple amazing. I am hard pressed to single out any song that is significantly better than the other ones. That said on a 4 hour bike ride all I listened to was &#34;Retreat and Review&#34; and &#34;If In Money We Trust&#34; over and over. I have put the CD aside for safe keeping and will buy another copy since it may become as hard to get another copy of this CD as it is to get a new copy of &#34;Hymns to the Silence.&#34;
0143038419|3.0|This book took me forever to finally finish it. I just simply wasn't entertained and that is my primary reason for reading any book. It's why you rarely see me reading/reviewing non-fiction books. I feel like there are some good life lessons in this book but there are also a lot of unnecessary details of her experience that don't really add anything to the book itself. It's a very good, detailed and well-written transcript of what happened during her travels, but definitely not a book for entertainment. I'm interested to watch the movie, as this may be one time that I actually enjoy a movie more than a book...

B004X6PRO6|1.0|I tried reading this since it was chosen by my book club but after forcing myself to read the first 5 chapters I was done. This book was confusing, it didn't flow at all and didn't really make a whole lot of sense. I was told by other book club members if I could just force myself through half of the book I would start to like it. With a small child at home I don't have the time to force myself to read a whole book in hopes that I will like it. If it can't draw me in within the first few chapters it never will.

0307352145|5.0|I was trained to speak in public, and I can manage to give a speech without the urge to throw up, but when my health required me to spend a year flat on my back, alone in the house, I revelled in the solitude -- at the office, my desk was at the main intersection for the entire floor and in the course of a day, I ended up having conversations with everyone as they walked past.  How delightful to be able to read a book or write an article without interruptions!<br /><br />Susan Cain confirms that there's nothing wrong with me preferring to work alone instead of on a team, preferring to do paperwork at the office while someone more extroverted makes the sales calls.  I was very successful doing that; it wasn't my name \\"up in lights\\" but I never wanted it to be -- I was happy with the acknowledgement that he couldn't have done it without me.<br /><br />Now if only I could get the extroverts around me to understand that \\"one genuine relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.\\"  I have only ever had one or two close friends wherever I lived.  I was respected on campus, but never nominated for any elected office other than paperwork-intensive secretary/treasurer which no one else wanted.  Hard to explain to the gregarious boyfriend who was president of everything, including student council, though perhaps reading this book will finally get him to understand.<br /><br />They always say \\"write what you know\\" and Cain, as an introvert, is better suited to writing this book than an extrovert would be.  She understands and accepts the benefits to introversion and isn't trying to change us.
B00AO3K01C|5.0|Ruth Ozeki is one of my favorite authors.  I read &#34;My Year of Meat&#34; in 1998 or 1999 and it was so good that story has always stuck with me.  Since she (or the time being in the book) likes to imagine where her readers read, I was on my couch in my 1DK (with loft!) at Leopalace… flopped out on my second-hand couch, probably settling in to eat some gobo salad from 7-11.<br /><br />Fast forward to March 2013, where you’ll find me living in Olde Europe, thrilled to see a new book by this author.  I bought the kindle edition, which was great for the footnotes.<br /><br />I lived in Japan for five years and she's nailed it.  She gets the good, the bad, the ugly, the incomprehensible, the cruelty, the bullying.  Some Japan-lovers might cringe at her depiction of junior high school life, but I lived it and it's disturbingly accurate.  If you are someone who wants to think of ikebana, tea ceremonies and polite schoolchildren when you think of Japan, do NOT read this book.  (If you are someone who wants to enjoy your factory-farmed burger, do NOT read “My Year of Meat.”)<br /><br />I really enjoyed the framing of the stories within a story, reading one part of the story in bed to her partner.  However, the book is not perfect.  I loved it as a whole because of all the contrasting bits and Ozeki’s interesting ideas, but there were some things I found implausible and other parts that were over my head (quantum mechanics).  I’m not convinced that someone who hasn’t spent time in Japan would get it, but maybe I’m underestimating the general public’s imagination and knowledge!<br /><br />If you are intrigued by zazen, island life, writer’s block, kamikaze pilots, cosplay, climate change or talking to ghosts, this might be the book for you.
0525952926|5.0|Spellbinding. Fall of Giants and Winter of the World  are a good look at the effects of the two World Wars on the lives of families. While the main characters are fictional, the history is accurate. The look at Hitler and the Nazi's from the viewpoint of German citizens is chilling. Looking forward to book three of the trilogy.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I have always loved &#34;The Boz&#34; this is a great CD. &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34; is the best version I have ever heard.  Highly recommend this even if your not a &#34;Boz&#34; lover.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have listened to in years!  I hadn't heard much about La Havas, but I decided to check out the album.  I'm really glad I did - I have enjoyed listening to every song on the album.  Her lyrics are thought-provoking without being too heavy, her voice is gorgeous, and the backing music is relaxing! 5 STARS!!!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Enjoyable story looking forward to its continuation.<br />This book and story line has a lot of twists and turns and just when you think you have it figured out it will surprise you.
B0083Z614S|5.0|And the other, &#34;Little Lord Fauntleroy&#34; is by the same author.  Buy them both.  You won't regret it.  &#34;The Secret Garden&#34; is a story of rejection and redemption told metaphorically in the tale of a young orphan girl, Mary Lennox, age 10, left in the care of her reclusive uncle - a mysterious brooding figure of a man - who lives in a huge manor on the edge of the moors in Yorkshire circa 1900.  After discovering the existence of a cousin she never knew she had, and the whereabouts of a locked, walled garden that has fallen into disrepair, Mary discovers the joy of helping others as she strives to bring the garden back to its full beauty and help her uncle and her cousin overcome their own unhappy circumstances.  It's a magical book for anyone, boy or girl, age 10 or better.  I re-read my copy at least once a year.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The story line kept me going..it was very moving and although sad, he overcame so many obstacles. Loved the beautiful Bengal tiger! Well done!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best TV series out there today.  Eagerly awaiting season four.  Can't wait to see what happens to Lady Edith and if she  finally finds lasting love! Can't wait to see Carson, Mrs. Hughes, Daisy and the rest of the downstairs staff.
B00005Y6YB|4.0|Everything was sent timely and the CD worked fine. I would recommend this<br />company to all who are looking for a good bargain on used cd's.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is well worth £1.99 paid .You can see at a glance how much power is left and the colour code helps.So do the estimated times for each type of use.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Although this is on the same theme as the others, it is definitely different and stands on it's own. Kept my wife occupied for the full 3 hours
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I'm going to see the play &#34;Still Alice&#34; next month, which is based on this book, so that's why I read it. I was so incredibly moved by this fictional tale of a healthy, brilliant Harvard psychology professor who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50. This novel is told from Alice's point of view, and the narrative style of the book drastically changes as Alice's disease progressively worsens. I couldn't put the book down. I think this is a great book to help give people a small glimpse into how terrifying life must be for Alzheimer's patients. I hope I live to see a cure for this horrible disease in my lifetime.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Definitely a well acted show with deep characters and good story arcs. This show is worth watching all the way through.
B002CO1Y2A|5.0|With raw energy, pumped to have Hagar. I put this cassette in my walkman back in the day and heard Sammy start off with \\"Helllllooo Babbbbyyy...\\" What I heard next was the measuring stick for every other rock album I would hear in my life. The guitars are insane-riff packed and perfect. the solos blend perfectly with the songs. And, the songs-I know people loved Dave's stuff and all but I could never listen to a Dave era album start to finish. The songs weren't always there. Every song is catchy, even the last 'goofing around' track Inside. There's no denying that all cylinders were firing for these guys. Instant hits like Dreams, Why Can't This Be Love, Best of Both Worlds, Love Walks In, rockers like Get Up and Good Enough and the insane guitar work on 5150 make this album one that I would take to a deserted island, if given a choice.<br />If you don't have this, it is well worth checking out. There was something almost too perfect happening here. All the stars aligned and they put out an album that would shame most other bands offerings. Also to note are the electronic drums that Alex used on this album. They give a different sound/flare to the music and I really miss it because I believe Alex ditched the electronic drums for the next album, OU812.<br />Dreams is my favorite song, catchy as anything and yes, it is heavy on the synths but who cares, it hammers home without most 80s cheese synth pop. There's plenty of guitar to go around.<br />Odd thing was they never seemed to make a video for this album-considering you couldn't turn on MTV back in the day without seeing VH after a few songs was surprising. It sold great anyway. They did have a video for Dreams that featured a flying team, forgot the name, Blue Angels maybe. No band shots. There also was a video for Best of Both Worlds, which was released to promote their live VHS at the time, Live Without a Net. You wanna see a rock band deliver an energy packed show? Pick up that now DVD and witness Michael, Alex, Sammy and Eddie at peak some bands can only dream about.<br />Anyways, enough, go buy this and crank it up. the songs won't leave your head.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show ever, and that's saying a lot considering how much i love some of the other shows i watch, but this one is just incredible. It can make you obsessed!
B0094K1WZE|1.0|I had to give up on this movie as it was repeatedly interrupted by &#34;loading&#34; stop messages. Amazon Prime movies are &#34;free&#34; if you do not mind that they are poorly provided.
B000062XFG|5.0|I love everything about this series!  The characters are beginning to develop personal relationships and trust each other more.  I had forgotten many of these episodes, but they are great!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie is awesome. Plenty of action! If you love super hero movies you will love this. Batman Vs The Joker is epic.
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|Way too many innuendoes. Saying stuff like 'go sit on your 'molasses' and many many other things I wouldn't want my kids repeating. I rented it because someone said it was a heartwarming story. But I was so irritated about all the other stuff, my heart didn't feel very warm. It was definitely geared toward an adult audience, not a child one.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I love this movie. I have had it before and after I lost it I knew I had to replace it. Very good movie.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I don't have a facebook account nor am I willing to pay to play this game.<br />Hence the reason I downloaded it from the free section.<br />It was alright when I played it so for me paying would not be an option
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Needed this for my Kindle. It does what it's should do. Works in the background no fuss no bother. Great product.
B009NXV51S|5.0|Really enjoyed it. My daughter and I watched it together. We really liked it. My daughter had seen it before and wanted to see it again.
B0094OLFUW|3.0|I heard great things about this band, but all the songs sound the same and put you to sleep. It just lacks energy to me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The author has done a very good job of pulling the reader into his story and keeps interest level at a peak throughout the book. I found it a little hard to follow in some of the time switching elements.<br /><br />Every parent of small children ought to read this book and ask,&#34;How well do I know my child?&#34;.
145150506X|5.0|. What better place to start in reading the short story and mystery than Edgar Allen Poe . It was my delight to read Poe on Halloween eve's with friends when I was a teen. Best read with lights low -- though beware, the reader might wind up staying up until sunrise due to fright. Boo!
B005LAIIFS|4.0|I love the movie. I did not like the egg walkers. One was already broken when I got it.<br />Should have been made a bit better.
030716327X|5.0|What could be more fun for a baby than to have a book it can touch and tear apart and droll all over.
B007CGNOAI|3.0|Held my interest, unusual story about a disenchanted teacher.  Adrien Brody did a good acting job and so did the younger female lead.  Don't remember much else, so must not have been too great.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|WOW! This is kick-ass rock'n'roll at its finest. Why this band isn't bigger than what they are is a mystery. This CD is never boring. It just plain rocks all the time.I just got turned on to these guys and boy am I glad I did.I will  eventually  buy all their music.
B000062X90|5.0|Great classic rock @ a great price! Nothing more worth saying. If you like classic guitar rock, you owe this yourself!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good graphics and audio. Fun to play on any mobile device. No data or Wi-Fi connection needed. I recommend Mahjong HD.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is an attractive watch though very large - it would look best on a substantial wrist. It keeps time well, and seems to be good quality for the money.  I don't dive and prefer not to wear a watch in the shower even if it is water-safe, however, so I will probably never know if it is not dive safe.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This is the best season yet for the Dexter series.  Action is outstanding, and I am seriously looking forward to the seventh season, which is scheduled to be released next month.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game awesome.At first it's challenging at first but it's cool.Me and my friend's play it all the time.I love this game.
B000I186FW|5.0|this is a great movie with a interesting main character.  It is a great comic book to movie cross over and in itself a great story overall.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Some people think that Minecraft stinks they never tried it  then when they come back from playing it they said that it was awesome
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I enjoyed the romance and the author had me laughing out loud several times.  I truly felt the emotion in this book and was almost crying at times and smiling wide at others.  I think I was beautifully written and would love to read more of her books.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone-add it to your library.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app.  Anytime I need to search something up real quick on my Kindle Fire, I can do it in seconds.  Very easy. Love it!!!! ( :
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|I loved this app and had great luck with it on my Thunderbolt, but it just does not work on my Galaxy 3. On the recommendation of another reviewer, I uninstalled this version and went to the Google Play Store and installed the free version there. It works like it is supposed to.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is lots of fun  ....  can be challenging when getting to higher levels!  Can be a relaxing game as not timed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show because it keeps me wanting for more, every episode. I don't even watch TV but I sure do love the Walking Dead. It keeps me on the edge, and is always intense. I have watched every episode in every season thus far, and the more I watch it, the more I relate it to the world we live in now. We all are just trying to survive day to day, and no matter how far we get from are problems we seem to find the solution with in ourselves. People die, some people good some people evil, and we all our choices have an effect on the bigger picture.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Need to use this to really get into it.  This was recommended by a friend but haven't really used it yet.
B006ASALY6|5.0|I love this album, especially when it first came out. I had the extended 12&#34; for &#34;Backfired. Then the lp. And then got it as soon as it was released on cd. Of course you got the album on cd, without any remastering or remixes. Even though I still have my 12&#34;, I love that the cd has the extended mix to &#34;Backfired&#34; & two other songs. &#34;The Jam Was Moving&#34; & &#34;Inner City Spill Over. I just wish there was an extended mix to &#34;Military Rap&#34;, one of my favorites.
B008M721MS|5.0|Skype is great!  I know I will use this a lot as our grandkids get older  ...  it'll be great to keep in touch on a face-to-face basis.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Not usually a Will Ferrell fan (too crass). This story is funny and family-friendly. Our whole family sat down and witched it even though there was some grumbling by the older kids at first. By the end we were all laughing. If you don't mind a Christmas story centered around Santa Clause and an elf looking for his real dad, this one is a great one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual, Michael Connelly has created another excellent Harry Bosch novel.  Connelly never disappoints. He is one of only a handful of authors whose writing improves and who hasn't succumbed to the lazy lack of technique that seems to attack most writers of serial character novels. I can't imagine his running out of ideas, but when he does, I bet he quits writing and refuses to pump out trash just for the publishers and the money.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It is very nice..love it and it is fun to play and it is great for the  whole family to enjoy.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|This album has a nice blend of old and new. The title song has a great mix of sounds that make it different and worth listening to more than once. I recommend it if you like the Robert Randolph and also Michael Franti and hte Spearheads. Has some oldtime, hard to beat hooks injected with different sounds.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|It is very nice..love it and it is fun to play and it is great for the  whole family to enjoy.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie shares the same kind of snappy dialogue and humor that Mean Girls and Easy A movies have. I enjoyed seeing both a movie that was funny and smart as well as a movie I could sit and enjoy watching with my teenager. Watching this movie made me reflect on the current state of comedies. Although not a teenage movie, it was more like a John Hughes movie where the plot went somewhere, the comedy made sense, the bittersweet flowed into the plot at the right places, and the music was great.<br />Comedies have gotten so sloppy lately (Yes, I'm talking about you Bridesmaids - yes - funny - but also long and could have been tightened up quite a bit.)  Comedies today let the sight gags run way too long, The timing is off on a lot of the jokes, which are, again, played far too long-- so much so that the funny is gone by the time they end. The editing is sloppy. Who wants to see a 2 and half hour comedy? (Yes, I'm talking about any Judd Apatow movie) The plots include unnecessary raunch maing it unwatchable in mixed company. So it was a pleasure to see a movie that understood where it was going and was appropriate to watch with a teen.
B000002J0G|5.0|I like how they added a little death metal voice to this record.The production is better then their earlier stuff too (not that the sound quality is the #1 thing though).
0920668364|5.0|This was a book that my son and I loved when he was young. I am giving it to him for his first Father's Day. It takes on a whole new meaning.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|As a 23 year old who has no kids I have to say this was the most adorable movie I have ever seen I would highly recommend this movie to anyone it was to cute I love this movie and I'm excited to see the despicable me 2 movie in july
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Anything that makes me question what I thought was my &#34;right&#34; way of thinking is always a VERY good thing.<br /><br />This is a book for EVERYONE to read if you are a woman but more importantly if you have ANY interaction with women.<br /><br />Whether you agree or disagree with Sheryl Sandberg, let's get the conversations moving forward and lifting EVERYONE up and creating opportunities and honoring all choices.
B005F3XV62|4.0|Very good movie kept me interested throughout had a couple laughs if you like dr Doolittle you will like this movie.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie had a well written screenplay and a cast of thousands.  Meanwhile the topic was thought provoking.  It was not what I expected.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Yes, as expected, the sex was great but I really enjoyed the actual story line behind the two main characters.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|This novella is a nice addition to the first novel in the Forever Girl series. It fills in some history and mythology while also providing an interesting and entertaining story unto itself. Rebecca Hamilton has a flair for creating a tale that grabs the reader and keeps their interest from start to finish.<br /><br />If I had to pick something that I didn't particularly care for in this story, I'd have to say that the romance element was a bit much for my taste at times, but only a bit. Of course, since I'm not exactly in the target audience for this series (or the genre for that matter) and I still rather enjoyed the story and writing style, I'd consider that a very minor quibble indeed.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any fans of paranormal fantasy or those who would like to give the genre or this author s first try. I think that this novella would stand up fairly well on its own without giving too much of the first one away if the reader so chose to go that route.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am so sad this is the last book.  Like the first two books, I can not put it down.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A quick read and a good philosophical document. It also got my girlfriends and I started with a &#34;lean in&#34; circle, which was the best outcome of reading this book. Downside: too few practical hints of what to do when you are faced with the behaviors or issues outlined in the book. A good complement: Lois Frankel's &#34;Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office.&#34;
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games series and can not put them down.  I am looking forward to reading the final book.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It is hard to let our best friends go.  This book was helpful in getting us through that.  The racing stuff was a little boring for me but overall it was a good book.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I don't remember how this one did at the theater. It was much better than I had expected.  Really great stunts and effects.  Totally not based on reality but nice escape from it too.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works as well as any other micro USB cable does. Snug connection and slightly thick cable. Feels sturdy. Good product.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting, great read and would recommend it, it was hard to put down.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|This was a delightful and surprising film about a physically challenged man who wanted to experience life and not allow his disability to limit him. Hellen Hunt is one of our favorite actresses and does not disappoint in this film. William H Macy also plays an excellent supporting role. If you're squeamish about sex, this is not for you, but if you want to experience the indominable spirit of a young man stretching himself beyond what others tell him he can be, it is a delightful film.
0763657875|5.0|I truly adore pop up books and often purchase them if it's to my liking or interests.  I've been collecting them for many years now.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one amazing love story.<br />From young love to eternal love one couples journey.<br />Amazing actors portray the story of the kind of love we all yearn to know.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A brilliant ending to a brilliant series! Lets be honest...these books weren't the best that I've read, BUT! The twist at the end was fantastic! It was so horrific and unexpected...it turned the whole thing upside down! And I'm so glad a certain someone ended up with another CERTAIN someone...*hint* *hint* *wink* *wink*<br />I highly recomend this book to anyone who wants to read it (although keep little, little kids away...)<br />Anyway...overall it was a pretty awesome series and I really enjoyed it!
B0001ADAVK|2.0|Wondering why this movie was so unbelievably facile?  The writers Konner and Rosenthal were simply out of their element.  Look at their shared history: Planet of the Apes (2001), Superman IV, Star Trek VI, TV shows Cagney & Lacey, Remington Steele.  No wonder this movie is off the mark.  The acting is good, the music and photography too, but the hack writing totally ruined it.<br /><br />You have to suspend disbelief right from the get go-- the idea that an ENTIRE CLASS of college students, especially the most well-to-do in the country (likely the most spoiled) would have read and fully comprehended the entire textbook for the class before the first day just so they could make the new teacher look stupid?  A humorous situation I suppose, but no real teacher could ever believe that.  And the hero, fully aware the Italian teacher is a philanderer, chooses to sleep with him anyway then is disappointed when she finds out he's made up a colorful history of his war exploits when actually he had a desk job and never left the states?  It's not like she seemed to be expecting anything deep out of him anyway,  so what's the big deal?  And other than the fact it's about an art teacher, the title doesn't otherwise seem to have much to do with anything-- there's a missed opportunity. There are a lot of things that don't add up very well here, or are underdeveloped.  Suspending disbelief is fine for sci-fi and action films, but this film seems on the surface that it could be based in reality, with a feel-good message that ends up being pretty shallow-- suspending disbelief to get there is just not effective.  The writers ought to get out of their trailer once in awhile, and read something other than comic books.
B000641Z90|5.0|We listen to this every time we have a few drinks to finish off the night and totallt rock out!
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|What can I say about a film whose plot is about a bunch of children killing each other, some with too much gusto??  And the future?  Wow, it is boring and full of 2 dimensional, boring, uninspiring people.  I won't be wasting my time on the next 2 installments of this nonsense.  I'll take The Arnold in The Running Man instead.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|If you are looking for performance art...this might satisfy.  If you are into silent movies this might satisfy...If you are looking for quality film...this will NOT satisfy<br />Boring, totally a collection of still shots with very little dialogue and uninteresting.  Poor character development, poor script, some in subtitles, some not.<br />My girlfriend and I both fell asleep watching it.  So it's best merit is as a sleep aid to fight insomnia.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I love the Harry Bosch series. The set of the murder is a story in it's self. Then the usual twist and turns along with Harry's own humanity is always a page turner. once i start one of these stories I can't put them down.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|If you like singing you should really like this movie. This is one of those movies I will watch many times.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|Not the normal Jeffrey Archer storytellig. It did not have the intrigue normally expected and the ending was just flat
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Enjoyed this precursor for the lord of the rings trilogy.  The casting worked out better than I had expected and was solidified by the continuation of the Gandalf character and actor.  At first I did not want to accept the dwarves as they did not follow in the lord of the rings looks mold but they surrmounted that change with their individual characters and the actors abilities.
B0063GORYU|5.0|What a fun game.  Great for waiting in line.  I have a stressful job, and I can get lost in this game.  It's like a mini vacay.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have yet to completed the trilogy as yet. There are points I need to let it rest in the back of my mind for a while.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|This would be much better if it could be intalled on my phone's SD Card. It looks heavy and makes my GS3 slow.  I am sure that Amazon could easy deal with this, so I could give 5 stars.  On PC, as downloader, it works great and I love it
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book written by a member of DEVGRU who was actually a member of the Team, and who trained for the op and participated actively in it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I already read the books and really enjoyed them so I thought I would watch the movie too. So far, so good. I think the books are better but the movie is still good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this season!! Actually, I loved all 3 seasons!  I can' wait until Season 4 comes out!! BEST EVER!! :)
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was highly recommended by several book club readers ... I beg to differ.  Definitely not my cup of tea ... so twisted in mind, heart and soul.  Who needs crazies.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Something about being corrupted, wouldn't install so I can't even be sure it would work at all. (need more words.)
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Great movie one I could watch more than once and I recommend to buy it worth every penny and I love I can watch it on any of my devices so kudos to amazon
B007VUCAVO|5.0|WHAT A USEFUL APP! By fat the best app that I have downloaded so far. I seriously could not live without it and couldn't even begin to say how often I check it. Love how it just sits there and is instantly available. Plus, it is really nice to look at. Well done!
0399215921|1.0|My son LOVES this story but this book is too small for him to enjoy.  I would recommend buying a larger version.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|I used this adapter to connect my Nexus 4 to my HDTV and the Nexus 4 worked really smoothly. I didn't experience any lags while streaming videos or playing games. I also liked how you can charge your phone while using it. I did notice my phone getting really hot while streaming videos.<br /><br />I gave this a 4/5 due to pricing and availability. I purchased it for the original price $29.95, if you're paying any more than that, you're getting ripped off.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great series cannot wait for season 2. Cannot believe how clear the pictures are.  The sound is good also.  Well worth the money.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Out running one morning Liz asked if Donna and I had read &#34;Born to Run&#34;?.  She said, &#34;It will totally change the way your think about running, exercise and maybe even change the way you run&#34; Then she gave us a wee run down on the book.  I downloaded it that evening and was hooked! Not only did it change how I mentally approached going out for a longer run (sometimes I did struggle with the whole &#34;get going&#34;, but my running &#34;style&#34; has had a  major overhaul with the end result being a lighter footfall and midsole landing which equates to faster running with less effort! This book was also such an interesting and entertaining read.  I googled so much while reading it.
B008Y73940|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie. It is a different twist on the lawyer/courtroom genre. McConaughey plays a lawyer who serves the underbelly of society from the backseat of his Licoln Towncar. in the process, he discovers something about himself and the law that he had lost.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Multiple levels gives it a varying difficulty allowing for a large age range. It's just fun and a bit addictive.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Kinsella never disappoints me.  This book is so much fun to read.  Poppy Wyatt is an adorable girl who is in the wrong relationship and doesn't know it.  The ending had me giggling out loud.  Loved it.
0765325950|4.0|I have waited for years to see how the series was going to end.  I have enjoyed the entire series.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Overall, very good. However, there were some episodes which were kind of boring. I liked the first and second seasons.
B008602KQI|3.0|Of course I read the book first, but if the movie had been my only introduction this world, I would've been very underwhelmed and wondering what the buzz was all about.  The screenplay missed so many opportunities for extracting the emotional poignancy and &#34;fish out of water&#34; aspects that were communicated so well in the book.  This movie was closer to &#34;The Running Man&#34; in character than it was to the book itself.  Great cast, but cheap-looking production value and pedestrian directing made this movie a yawner.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|While Stephen's politics leave a lot to be desired, his writing is just genius in my opinion.  As I am planning my first novel, this helps with gaining perspective and what works for him.  Take his advice with a grain of salt.  What works for one person isn't going to work for all, obviously.  But I like the background and reading about the challenges he faced with addiction, income, etc.  I highly recommend this for any aspiring writer.  It's a must read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very stable both on Kindle Fire HD and iOS. Only without ads would make it better!<br /><br />One of the best out there. Consistent look and feel across platforms.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|For me, the biggest struggle is: can this book grab my attention right away and keep me interested.  I struggle a lot with that.  The only author that has successfully and consistently met that challenge has been Stephen King.  Having said that, this book is perfect.  The pace is just right (although sometimes it feels too heavy with description).  This is solid entertainment and I am happy to have added it to my collection.  Can't wait to read more from this author and this series specifically.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I saw The Secret and then I came across The Magic and I knew I had to give it a try. The 28 days of Gratitude is absolutely AWESOME! It works! I even got my husband reading it now. I feel so much happier and at peace with myself and the world because of it! If you are considering purchasing this book DO IT! What have you got to lose? All the negativity in your life that's what! I gave this book 5 stars because I have seen the MAGIC work first hand!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|The subject matter is really hard to read, but Gillian Flynn has incorporated her usual twists and turns into the plot.  She is a very imaginative writer and keeps the reader spellbound and almost afraid to turn the page to see what's next.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you are interested in learning more about running, some of the evolutional background behind running, and personal accounts from some famous ultramarathoners, then I highly recommend reading this book. It will take you to the jungles of Mexico where the tribe called Tarahumara shows off elite ultramarathoners how to run efficiently without the use of current shoe technology.
B00B23O96A|4.0|...and he delivers once again! Still majoring on his exploration and joy of old blues, this Cd does not disappoint
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|go playing to this game that was so cool let'play and that was free playing playing playing playing playing that was so cool really.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|Bragg's best album since Mermaid Avenue; it's probably his best ever! He can still break your heart (Goodbye Goodbye), make you laugh (I'm Not Your Handyman) and get you fired up and ready to take on injustice (There Will Be a Reckoning) within minutes. A master at the top of his craft. Buy this album!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn spins an amazing story.  This is one of the best yet,  I'm a huge fan and can't wait for his next work!
B00C5UV3YU|2.0|The news of this DVD, much like the news of their \\"Love Songs\\" CD, comes as a disappointment. Not only have these videos NOT been remastered in HD and put on Blu-ray, but this collection serves as a \\"Greatest Hits\\" video collection and not the complete anthology us big fans have been waiting for. I wouldn't be surprised if the videos weren't even anamorphic widescreen since Beyonc&eacute;'s \\"B'Day Video Anthology\\" and \\"Above and Beyonc&eacute;\\" DVD's were not. Missing from this collection are EIGHT music videos<br /><br />01. \\"With Me (Part II) [feat. Jermaine Dupri]\\"<br />02. \\"Get on the Bus (feat. Timbaland)\\"<br />03. \\"Bug a Boo (Refugee Camp Remix) [feat. Wylcef Jean]\\"<br />04. \\"Jumpin', Jumpin' (So So Def Remix) [feat. Jermaine Dupri, Da Brat & Lil Bow Wow]\\"<br />05. \\"Survivor (Remix feat. Da Brat)\\"<br />06. \\"8 Days of Christmas\\"<br />07. \\"Nasty Girl\\"<br />08. \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\".<br /><br />Granted, some of these would feel a bit out of place or be a bit redundant, but the non-remix, non-holiday videos should have been included, without question. I'm giving this DVD two stars because it really is a bargain release at under fifteen dollars, but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for. Will I buy this? Yes. Am I disappointed? Extremely. I'm settling, big-time - because it's either this or do what I have to do now, which is pop in various random Destiny's Child releases to watch the few videos that have been included on them. Here's to hoping Columbia records catches up with the time and gives us a Blu-ray disc with ALL of their videos, in anamorphic widescreen (where it applies) and heck, they can still be in standard definition, but an HD remastering would be amazing.
B00005A0BC|4.0|has a few crackles/pops here and there, but not a big deal at all. great album to own if you listen to vinyl.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites in last year<br />I put five stars because is original and a great book.
B004OKFISQ|5.0|i have the original pressing, but i wanted the remastered version to add to the collection.<br />i recommend this to every human being.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|This is a Sequal to the 1st Bridge Constructor game with some nice Additions and Improvements!  It has been Developed by Clockstone Studios in Cooperation with Headup Games (not a copy or theft).  The Credits from first page will verify this.  It also has a GOOD TUTORIAL section which is actually the first Region called TUTORIA.  Every level has Instructions, Suggestions, and pertinent info to help you learn the features and process for building.  You then use your own skills to improve your bridges.<br /><br />The Graphics are Awesome HD 3D Quality and the Bridge weight carrying Tests are Realistic.  The Music and Sounds are Pleasant and Appropriate to add nice Atmosphere to the game.  The Controls work very well with Smooth material placements on my Xoom Tablet.  All selecting buttons work properly and can be Expanded or Closed on both sides of screen to give larger view of bridge areas.<br /><br />OVERALL:  A very Engaging, Challenging and Satisfying game to Test your Physics and Building Skills.  Anyone who like Physics / Puzzle apps should like this one.  The Permissions seem OK for the features included.  Looks like most of the Negative Reviews were a result of not paying attention to the CREDITS, Developer Info and realizing that the 1st TUTORIA Region is actually the Easy TUTORIAL that is well done.  Tutorial teaches methods but will not guide you through every decision on each level.  Gets more difficult as you progress and makes you work for enough Achievements to open next Region.  You can also REPLAY Levels any time to Change Bridge design and increase scores.  Good Replay Value too.<br />It is a well designed app that should not be shot down if player does not like this type of game either.  It is VERY GOOD and plays exactly as described.  Glad I tried it for myself.  It's a definite KEEPER!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a good romance  book, had a good suspense to but yet didn't make the book boring. I was happy with the ending.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|This came delivered sooner than expected.  I was very impressed with the directions and ease of use.  Reading the directions a must in achieving a clean glass cut.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Simply adore this little app. I love playing games were you have a story line behind it. The pets are soooo cute! And a variety of pets to choose from
030746363X|4.0|I found the read integration as well as interesting. Tim Ferries has come up with a plan I believe I can stick to. I'm one week it did ok so far lost 3 pounds, much more then anything else I've ever tried. I'll weight a review again in a month see if I'm down 20lb.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|THIS BOOK BLEEW MY MIND. So much detail, AS well as suspense and detail. Its not just about the magic, it's so much more... it will have you reading under the sheets at night
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't know if I can wait until September to see the conclusion...but this show and the cast are well worth the wait!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was well written, interesting and moving.A tale of redemption and growth through tough life circumstances.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show so much watched all of Season 1 and 2 in an entire weekend!! I am hooked and looking forward to Season 3!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The premise is a game where 24 children between the ages of 11 and 18 are locked in an arena to kill each other until only 1 remains.  It sinks into greater depravity and misery from there.  Who recommended this series for children? It should be rated X for harsh content and kept from anyone under college age.  It's about inhumanity, both on an individual level, and what such action and treatment does to perpetrators and survivors.  It's about what kind of political system would employ such measures.  The descriptions of barbaric violence are graphic and specific.  I have images in my mind it will take me a long time to be rid of.  I wish I'd never read it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very handy.  One of my most used app.  Very easy to operate.  Visually appealing. No complaints.  Well designed. 5 star rating deserved.
B0098R6M1M|3.0|Disappointed that the best scenes are in the trailer.  The story seemed to veer all,over and never explain Cardinal Melville's issue.  And the volleyball game, cute but how was it relevant to the story?
B00A4GXJD0|4.0|i am not the biggest kid rock fan, but this is a really good mixture of rock and blues.  i was looking for a little more
B005G4TJI4|2.0|If not for my childhood attachment to Transformers, I probably would only have maybe seen this movie at some point on TV.  The pacing was poor.  The story could have been done much better and the acting was phoned in.  The first movie was a great popcorn flick.  The second one you could see was just meant to capitalize on the success of the first one, which is often the case for sequels.  But usually if the second one does well enough, the third one is done well since they know it's unlikely that there will be more, at least from the same people.  This is a prime example of what happens when the only goal is to milk the franchise for money with no concern for the brand.  I'm not sure what I expected, just know that I was disappointed.  It's not the worst movie out there by any means but it is probably not worth the price.
0767840135|5.0|Loved this as I have all the others I've seen. Would recommend to everyone. They are amazing performers and the music is as wonderful as well.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|This turned out to be my favorite of the X-Men franchise movies.  The original trilogy were good popcorn flicks and Wolverine was so-so.  But this is the first that was truly interesting.  The comic book fans have already dissected the movie enough that I'm not going to go into great detail about the story and it's relationship to the comic books but I will say that it's an interesting movie worth watching.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|It was an entertaining , action film that we wanted to see after seeing the two previous ones in the series
1591391105|5.0|A great book to help plan a successful launch into a new position / company. I have written a plan based on this book and it is working well.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Very good. Although, I personally like part three a bit better, this one is probably ranked second. Good story line. Good acting. Not bad at all
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Screwdriver was exactly as it was described.  Looks just like the one in the show.  Sounds just like it too.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've been playing it constantly since I received it.  A wonderful selection of songs,  all of which  have become my favorites.
B0064QNS62|3.0|I downloaded the free app just to try it out. It is a fun little game and a nice diversion from the real world.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I just loved it. It has a lot of behind the scenes and I am a big superman fan. Cool.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I felkt that I had better control over all the persons in the first book, but to learn so much impotant stuf aboot 2WW  amke this book to a MUST read book.
B000000OU0|5.0|The Eagles have always been a great influence to me growing up!<br />Had all their 8 - Tracks & now their C.D.'s<br />Can't wait for new music from them
B000W93CHC|5.0|You watt to turn the page faster than you can read. Following a village trhough generations is great and exciting
B007O4XX9K|5.0|Had to play it a couple of times but I thinks he sounds even better<br />Joe has a gift and I'm glad he's sharing it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this game. It is easy to learn and play on my Kindle. I am still getting used to some of the symbols.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|A cute fun movie to watch.  I wanted to watch something just to relax and take my mind off the day to day stress.  This movie fit the order!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitare is always a fun game to play and I like having it on my Kindle because I can take it almost anywhere.
0743270754|5.0|History tends to deal with people in two dimentions . this book gets behind thecomplexity and nature of human reality involved with a people in the midst of the contradictions of war and reality
B008FC4WA4|4.0|a good commentary on man and his relationships in the 21st century.  makes you think about your own relationship as well
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|A great fantasy show with lots of excitement. The family and friend dynamics make for plenty of happy times in the show that work well with all of the suspense.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very different from most other books but it was pleasantly well done. I'd recommend for anyone who likes alternate reality or fantasy.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Great movie, great script, great actors, excellent pick up.11 more words are required for this review - 4 more words
B0068LYEHA|3.0|Caitlin Moran is a very well known journalist in Great Britain which would explain the success of How to be a Woman there.  I was born and raised in England, and understand her ribald sense of humor which sometimes sinks to the gross.  Maybe I've become more conservative since I have lived in the US (30 some years now), but I honestly found her 'frankness' on subjects such as abortion, (soooo sensitive a subject), bodily functions, and of course, sex, explicitly and deliberately shocking.<br />This would explain it not being that successful in the US.  I would have trouble recommending this to anyone I know, and I have an eclectic group of friends....<br />Also, her use of British colloquialisms and brand names may be very confusing for American readers.<br />She is funny though, and this collection of essays does make some good points on sexism and feminism in the 21st century, but be prepared for brash, whinging ideologies ..... Russell Brand has nothing on this woman!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Could this movie actually mean more to white people than black people?  I adore this movie because it gives pure empowerment to black people, and works to demolish the ripples of southern slave owners, which, at least because of no reparations, may be the perfect sort of balm to heal the still-wounded side of black culture.  To my understanding of filmmaking and how Quentin Tarantino works, this was the intention, just as Inglorious, everyone got their rocks off getting back at nazis and hilter.<br /><br />What I didn't realize is that so many black people are not disturbed living in white culture, and feel happy, accepted and integrated, they perceive the Melting Pot and the equality more than \\"living in white culture\\".  Such a movie as this could possibly pull up old pains that a black person worked hard to overcome.  This is all just a consideration, and I, a white fellow, am just speculating.  One of my black friends said that to him it was just a love story, trying to get the wife back.  That he received it this way was so surprising to me.  He told me Roots was the movie that really gave some kind of recognition and justice to black people, which i haven't seen.<br /><br />Still, a movie based on the indulgent slaughter of southern slave owners can't be beat.  And back in the days of slavery, a story such as this would have been the legend of the times to black people.  Leonardo is pretty painful to watch, he plays a good villain.
B004OR199G|4.0|I bought this book quite honestly because it was on sale, but found myself reading it from cover to cover.  I usually buy these kinds of books on plant based diets for a few recipes and ideas, but found Kris Carr's story very interesting.  Her reasons for choosing a plant based diet are serious - a cancer diagnosis at 38.  And she's done her research and gained education in diet and nutrition.  I intend to attempt the 21 day cleanse - not as harsh as it sounds - plenty of juices and raw foods - and healthy life style changes, or at least combine her tips into my ever growing changeover to a plant based, healthier lifestyle.<br />Worth a read for people who are even vaguely interested in cleaning up their act.  Great recipes, good motivation, well paced daily eating and exercise schedules.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|You can't get much better cinema.  Great story, immaculate main character arc, great drama, great filmmaking, provocative, an indisputable 'best actor' performance from Sharlto Copley though god knows who got that oscar that year, and great action.  This film maker is Neil Blomcamp is unbelievably competent in cinema for someone who was unheard of by the masses.<br /><br />I will say that this movie was absolutely painful to watch.  I felt gripped by it, and who doesn't like a gripping movie, but it was painful to sit through.  The reflections of the worst parts of human nature, and the viscerality of the film gave me knots.  But how could I not give this movie an ecstatic five star?  I just saw Elysium is coming out which looks like a blow-my-hair-back sort, so I rediscovered District 9, and here I write.  Anyone with a nice tv and a bluray knows the value of intensely good action and drama.
B0046BI82G|3.0|Death Race Two is actually a prequel to Death Race One which starred popular action actor Jason Statham of Crank and The Transporter fame.<br />Synopsis : We meet the driver monster played by actor Luke Goss before he became monster and we learn how the Death Race game developed and evolved from a gladiator type of game into the game that utilizes cars instead.<br />In Death Race Two we also meet actor Fred Koehler, better known as , List, the quite yet highly intelligent young man who helps Monster become the legendary driver he becomes.<br />We also get to meet the rest of Monster race crew led by favorite character actor, Danny Trejo.<br />Bottom line ... A good action movie but actor Luke Goss does not have the presence actor Jason Statham has, but still a good movie to see how it all began.
B00005N6KG|1.0|The right earplug does not transmit sound.<br />I did not return it to Sony because of lack of time<br />to bother with it.  I do not recommend product.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this movie for my son who loved it when we lived in Tokyo.  Our entire family loves it. The movie, while different from Disney movies for kids, is interesting, giving a little peek into Japanese culture while also providing an interesting plot.  I show this movie to my college class in Japanese culture every year and inevitably most of them end up buying it for themselves or their kids. I highly recommend it.
B009GN6DT4|4.0|It had been at least 15 years since I'd seen it, and decided to watch it as a family movie with my kids (7 & 5 years old). We enjoyed it, but I didn't remember the random foul language used sportingly by the kids in the movie (i.e. calling each other \\"p****-breath\\", etc.), which was totally unnecessary.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Fun movie with many items from past &#34;Bond&#34; movies.  Fun to watch over and over again.  Love Daniel Craig !
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|It was worth the money as a gift. i haven't asked my cousin about it yet but he hasn't complained.
030758836X|1.0|This book is really well written, very clever, and an intriguing page turner. However, I did not like it at all. The characters were written with plenty of description and depth but, I loathed them. They were shallow and self-serving people and I had no desire or care to know what happened to them. I like books where I can empathize with the characters, which is why I disliked this book. If it is not important to you to like the characters of the book, then you will probably enjoy this novel with it's intricate plot twists and unexpected ending.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|OK, so even if I wasn't a 'Mad About You' fan from back in the day, I would enjoy Helen Hunt naked.  It is a very good, based-on-a-true-story watch even without that, with un-condescending dialogue and humor.<br />And Helen Hunt.  Naked.<br />Just saying.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Maybe a few more sounds that can be played, and ultimately offered.  Otherwise, such an excellent app.!! I really love  it!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|As a sci-fi fan from way back, this hyped flick had a high bar to clear.  Is it 'Brazil' or 'Clockwork Orange'?  Of course not.  But perhaps it carries on the legacy, seemingly for each generation, of that eye-opening topical movie that manages to get watched AND get a message across:  from 'Soylent Green' thru 'Logan's Run' and 'Rollerball', to 'Blade Runner'  and 'I, Robot', sometimes the messenger is less what matters than the fact that the message itself is, at least, getting out there.<br />  Action, death, archery, teen-age romance?  All checked off on the Hollywood list.  Truth to the book?  Can't say, didn't read, but I have heard that the Dream Factory treatment is in evidence here as well.<br />  So, if TCM isn't airing 'The Most Dangerous Game' tonight, and you want to freshen up your metaphor-of-future skills, you could do worse that to watch this.
B009R659L8|1.0|This book had terrible formatting and should be corrected. Unable to read. Would like a refund? This should not happen.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Best part is it is free.  Much easier to access my email than going through the internet each and every time.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book has stuck with me since reading it.  Very well written and constantly kept me guessing.  Very Dark Indeed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the book, take out some of the sex and you have a very good love store. People need to. Look at that way.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this game after seeing my husband play it on his Ipad.  My 3 year old kicks my butt at this game!
B008NW67E0|4.0|Music for the entire family. My husband saw them perform on the Grammy's and liked them, so it was a must-have birthday gift.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 3 year old.  He loves it and is quite the little master at it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It got here super quick! I love this movie soooooo much so I had to preorder it and it arrived on that day!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I started watching the free versions of season 1 and 2 and it hooked me.  I had to start watching season 3 on amazon to get caught up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the reward for kindle fire and if you want to get more information about it, then this is the correct time to do it on the  Internet. Also on Facebook you can get on Terri  Hitesman's page and find a little. Maybe you can get more than you think.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie was awesome. I now wish that I had purchased it and not rented it. I will have to purchase it for my library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is a really fun game.. helps u lose time an  keep u busy.. I love this game but I can never beat my high score..also u get to play wit in people from your Facebook so that is interesting
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really enjoy this Bingo forum.  Lots of extras to go along with the game plus they give you plenty of free coins and Bingo credits.  I have never had tech problems with the app.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game and well worth the time. It's great trying to beat your previous timing on completing the game. Excellent time passer and great for kids too.
B008EKMB82|5.0|a complex multi layered well told story written with subtlety, nuance, kindness and insight.<br />of all of Ozeki's books to date, this is the masterpiece.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I'm a big Jimmy fan, couldn't believe I could get some new stuff. Yes I would recommend this CD to all fans!!!
B00BPLDCVM|5.0|Amazed that I enjoyed the whole album- this is currently on rotation in my CD changer. Really surprised me! Recommend
B0052UYJDC|5.0|If you can implement these practices, you will have a much easier, freer, happier and simpler life. Highly recommend.  You can even borrow the book for free with a kindle so you don't add to the clutter - nice.
B000PC0S5K|4.0|I like Eckhart Tolle's way of writing. One might say he repeats the same idea many times in his writing, but he does it with different words each time. I think this repetitions are needed in order to bring the idea over clearly. In spiritual talking, this is not an easy task.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a superbly written, excellent series. The story is original and the writing is excellent. I loved this so much that I purchased the &#34;Shift&#34; omnibus (which follows after the &#34;Wool&#34; series). Get these and read them - they are difficult to put down once you start!
B001GJ9GG8|5.0|Entrapment has a great cast.  Catherine is fantastic and Sean is none better.  There is a lot of action in this movie and very little nudity.  The ballet moves that Catherine does are unreal.  I rate this movie as Excellent and worth five stars.  A must see.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I<br />Was not familiar with this event in history. Very enlightening. I loved the characters,Vivian and  Molly, and found them both to be very strong women. Loved this book! Would highly recommend.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django is a very entertaining movie.  The &#34;N&#34; word is used an awful lot.  Very little nudity.  Lots of gun battles and enormous amount of blood.  There are a lot of one liners that are very funny and some people will take it seriously.  The actors and actresses were excellent and a pleasure to watch.  I highly recommend this movie for any adult but not for children under 17 years old.  Five stars all the way.
0634060384|5.0|Even though I'm not yet. This book is so cool because it has such a HUGE collection of wonderful tunes and songs. I find that almost every bebop or fusion CD I own from the 1950's onward has at least one tune in here. So that makes it very easy to get studying and learn what makes the song work. I bought Mark Levine's fabulous &#34;Jazz Theory Book&#34; at the same time and that also makes many reference to songs in Real Book 6th.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Once again, another Clint Eastwood film.  This one has great fight scenes in it.  Jaws, from James Bond flicks, gets his private parts knock around and becomes friends with Clint.  Watching this movie makes you want to look for gold in a stream some where in Colorado or California.  Must see.  Five stars all the way.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I'm still laughing at Dennis Miller's joke from 2002 when he said that the only reason Steely Dan won a Grammy was that 50 year old guys (like me) don't know how to download it for free. Well that's still the case and it's still the case the Donald Fagen get's more polished and inventive with every new album. It's always a good sign when you don't like it that much on the first hearing but it doesn't take long to get totally infectious and never comes out of the car CD slot. Fagen always attracts the cream of musicians of every era, Larry Carlton, Kieth Carlock etc and they all want to give him their best stuff. This batch of musicians are mostly new to me but they are all incredible and so are the songs. He has been getting a bit darker recently - the penultimate song is a jaunty vamp about nasty gang stuff but you still can't help loving it. He has lots of lyrics that you almost understand (a room out back with an old gas centrifuge? huh what !!) but not quite so you keep thinking about a song after it's finished. He does a version of Isaak Hayes' &#34;Out of the Ghetto&#34; which is an updated disco thing which at first seems a bit out of place. But then halfway through this super cool scratchy Klesmer violin appears out of nowhere and wails away until the end of the song and then you realize - oh yeah Jewish ghetto - clever.<br />Talking about jokes I still think that the cover of &#34;Katy Lied&#34; is the best cover of all time since it has a picture of a grasshopper or a cricket on the front with no explanation. And then ten years later I realized it was a bug called a katydid. I was high for days after thinking about that. Katy said she didn't but the bug on the cover tells differently. &#34;Katy lies, you can see it in here eyes&#34;. I can't lie either - this album is a fabulous.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|The Easter Bunny brought this movie for my 3 and 6 year old sons. They love it. Would recommend it.
044980691X|3.0|Book was good. Not great. Love John Grisham, but this book was no where near some of the greats that he has written.
B0027MJU00|5.0|There were parts that made me feel just sick. And the jumping around from past to present was confusing like a jumbled puzzle. Thank goodness it all came together at the end. However, I literally could not put the book down.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Fantastic!!!!!  It is a great  and exciting movie.  I thought the acting was superb.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris tells it like it realy is. Not just for SEALS but all US.troops that love and fight for their country past and preasnt. I would have liked to met him and thanked him for his service.
0307352153|4.0|This was an interesting read, recommended to an introvert by an introvert and very worthwhile. Wish I'd been able to read it 20 years ago; I think it would have made a difference to me. Still it's good to have validation. The points were well made and although they were not always fully convincing it really started to make me think about introversion/extroversion and all the points in between. It's a book that made me want to discuss it with other people and think through some of the detail which has got to be a good thing.
B008VBYN80|3.0|game is nice, but it trends to hang on my atrix 4g.when ever I play and connect to facebook for pvp. I end up having to task out to kill the process.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This game is terrible. It doesn't give you a tutorial, it doesn't give you useful items, the arrows are too close to the bar, and it makes the other players faster than you. Anyone who rates this a 5 star game is wrong.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show!  Nice character development and good story lines.  This show is not afraid to kill off key members, so you never know who is going to get it next.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I know everyone liked the book because of all the sex toys and stuff explained or introduced, but to me it was just a glorified Mills and Boons book. Didn't finish it. Story needed some spice. It's just sex over and over again.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm not ready for Harry's retirement yet but it's good to see the plot being set for his daughter to step up to take his role and make it better... I'm anxious to see how this grows and when she will debut butI would like to have Harry stick around and never totally be out of the picture.
B007NZQUUE|1.0|I couldn't really follow the story, gave up after a few chapters, almost begging for something to happen. To many story lins, nohing ties up anywhere
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci always keeps us guessing which way things will go and throws in a bit of romance in the process.  A real page turner.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Made me realize what I have, great story, funny and sad characters, a must read for everyone who needs love
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|One of the best TV shows I've seen in a long time, love the history behind it and the characters are just great also the scenery it's just amazing.
B003LU2FDG|5.0|This is an album from Madonna... how in the world could anyone not like this?  I am listening to it daily!
145162607X|5.0|I truly enjoyed looking at the times of the Kingmaker and his effect on royal history from the opposite side of the family drama.  Another take on the &#34;White Queen&#34; with a twist.  Well written with relatable characters.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|Great movie,  fun, exciting and dramatic.  Would watch again in another 5 years from now.  The special effects are great for how old the movie is.
B00BMQTY3U|3.0|It seems that nobody can find enough superlatives to describe Charles Bradley.  Yes, he has a very soulful voice.  Yes, he is emotional and sincere.  But he doesn't have nearly as many tricks in his bag as Papa himself (JB).  His vocal range is limited, his pitch is not great, and his approach to different songs is very similar.  This new record that tries to put Bradley in a more varied musical context actually serves to highlight his limitations in handling diverse material.  The first album is better.
0743454537|5.0|A great book for making you think!<br /><br />I read this book almost two years ago and I still think about it.  It is the tale of two sisters...one who is healthy and normal and one who needs to \\"take\\" from her sister in order to live a full life.  A terrible fate for any parents to have to deal with, however, the book challenges us to think and to consider what we would do in the same position.  The story is mostly told from the perspective of the \\"sick\\" daughter and it truly opens your eyes to how she felt, thought and dreamed.  I highly recommend this book - not for a light beach read, but for a book that engages you fully and raises more questions than answers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was so hard to put this book down! Very good! A lot of crazy twist and turns!  Did not expect that ending either!
B0017VG66I|5.0|these two movies are great entertainment, especially for the price. The iconic classic Shane is rich with the gritty pioneering life of the old west. And, of course, in both movies, the good guys are triumphant. A, &#34;must have&#34;, for all western fans.
0439023491|5.0|This book arrived expeditiously & in great condition!  There was a slice in the jacket of the book but other than that it was a great purchase.
B006ISJQBC|2.0|Despite the sleek look and neo noir aspirations, this movie is nothing more than the old 40's John Garfield chesnut about the guy who's out of jail and decides to go straight but &#34;destiny&#34; has other plans. Well, nothing works. The filmmaker can't seem to make up his mind about Redemption, Vendetta or Romance. So the whole thing curdles way before its predictable ending (you know the &#34;doomed hero&#34; is going to be done in by that teen punk he decides not to kill - I guess this is called Dramatic Irony 101). None of the characters, except for the always charismatic Farrell, are people we care about or root for. The villain is so mean it's beyond caricature - he belongs in an Austin Powers flik. The look of the film is polished as all get-up but adds to the emptiness of the material, and the Yardbird tunes, classic as they are, are used for no apparent reason - is the story supposed to take place in the 60's, does the leading man collect old rock ditties? Kiera Knightley, usually a superb actress and always a stunning presence, is stuck with a thankless part of a wimpy character with no interesting lines of dialogue to say. She seems to fall for Colin Farrell not just because he's the leading man and such an irresistible hunk, but also because, next to the David Thewlis character (her protector from the paparazzi), he looks like he bathes at least once a day - maybe he learned that in prison. There are a lot of subordinate characters and quasi-subplots that seem to be there simply as filler - certainly none of them advance the plot any. Which brings me to this: it is always a danger when writers (or stars) decide to direct their own material with no one there to keep their feet on terra firma. This particular writer-director seems to fall into that category. A shame, as Farrell, Knightley and Thewlis deserve better. The Blu-Ray disk is absolutely gorgeous to look at and the sound recording is crisp, but some of you might be offended (or bored) by the overuse of the F word.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Great story, a real page- turner. I enjoyed this one as much as the Secret Keeper and you will too.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Let me say this up front:  If you genuinely didn't enjoy Kiss Each Other Clean, you probably won't be super impressed by this new album.  It's very much New Sam Beam.<br /><br />Iron and Wine has gotten more accessible, and more pop-y over the years, but I honestly don't think it's hurt him.  I've liked every one of his albums so far, and this is no exception. I feel like this is the next step in his evolution as an artist.  I enjoyed Kiss Each Other Clean, but felt that it was a little overproduced, and Sam hadn't quite gotten the hang of the jazzy sound yet.  This is in the same style, but is, in my opinion, a much more polished album.<br /><br />While some of the songs (such as New Mexico's No Breeze) have a more conventional sound than much of his earlier work, this album maintains the extremely high lyrical quality which keeps me paying attention through multiple playthroughs.<br /><br />Highlights for me include Low Light Buddy of Mine, which is a slightly eerie and unorthodox love song, and Lover's Revolution, which has an entrancing crescendo from start to finish.<br /><br />THE UPSHOT:<br />Strong hooks, good melodies, great lyrics.  If you don't mind a layered sound and jazz influences, I would highly recommend this album.  Buy it.
0061969664|5.0|As usual with Cornwell, I couldn't put this book down. It went way too fast and was way too good. I read the whole thing in two flights from New Orleans to Charlotte and back. I wish Bernard Cornwell could write faster than I can read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Got this for my grand daughter and she is really great at it.  Keeps her busy and happy for some time.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Book kept my interest and was easy reading great story line looking forward to book 2 also had good sub plot
B00A77II0U|5.0|Good game, not what I expected.  Alawar never disappoints you.  Recommend buying the full version, challenging and interesting with fine graphics.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The Movie was great ...But i will no longer stream hd movies from amazon. this is the third time i have been burn't no hd audio . will not pay full pop for a hd stream without hd audio please fix!!!!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Really recommend playing all the Snark games.  Just plain fun with great graphics and fun story.  Like most of what Alawar does.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I own a kindle fire and its Super cool the usb cable long enough to charger and the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, livingroom everywhere and its really cheap I like buying at amazon
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|ove this game, wish for more like it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a story woiththe HO.
B009DT424Y|1.0|I'm rating this just one star because it didn't work properly- in all fairness I may have received a defective item but in comparing this price with other bluetooth mics I'm assuming I got what I paid for.  The mic wouldn't pair with my laptop, so to test the mic again I tried pairing with my phone and it paired and located the device but no sound came through.  There's also no mute button or volume adjustment which I would have liked.
B000BMYWYC|5.0|I bought this for my kids who purchased some models at Pat Catan's and did not realize that glue was not included.  This product worked great.  The tiny brush allows you to get the glue in precise locations without making a mess.  Holds very well.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I believe every person--young and old--in America should watch this movie--more than once. It speaks to the very core of humanity.
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize rather than the Academy Award. I laughed so hard I hurt myself.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A reminder of the beauty and importance of the preservation of nature and our world, told in spectacular terms... a must see in 3D!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy I couldn't put the books down it's worth it and the price was cheap get it through Amazon.com
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I laugh every time I see it... OUT LOUD!!!  If you love stupid comedy, you must get this movie.  Great to have it in Blu-ray!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't say enough about these books I absolutely love them all. Very cheap price and fast easy access to start reading the book
B0025KW29U|5.0|If you havent seen this, i highly recommend it. Harris' role as a shy villain is spot-on and Day's role as the love-interest is adorable. Its a must-watch for nerds :D
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I love this song since it came out my daughter is almost 3 and is addicted to the song also
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie scared me as a kid because its so different from the wizard of Oz that everyone knows. As i got older though i loved it because it showed such a dark side to that happy place.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This is good to have when you start a new career on how to interact with people what you should and shouldn't say and how to make awkward circumstances easier to deal with
1401207529|5.0|Really good look at Batman and Gordon in the first year at their jobs. Miller only wrote this one and did not do the art for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once again the trilogies amazing it's nice to be able to download part of a book to see if you want to read it or not
B007N6NGYG|5.0|My son loves all the apps & wallpaper's that are available here. They have so much to pick from he finds something new daily.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Tolkein and in my youth have read the books. I was impressed with Peter Jackson's rendition of Lord of the Rings and when I saw the Hobbit on the big screen, I knew I had to add it to my collection.
B0087EACJK|5.0|My son loves all the apps & wallpaper's that are available here. They have so much to pick from he finds something new daily.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i'm totally hooked, can't put it down. got about 5 other family members playing. try it out now. you will live it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Can't get enough of those Angry Birds. It's more of what you expect from these games, and more fun than AB Space.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Great show, was happy to see that it was available on Amazon. Good streaming and playback quality, no freezing or interruptions in playback
1603429999|5.0|I have been knitting circularly for some time and am a big proponent of all of Elizabeth Zimmerman's work, but this book is an amazing resource - really EVERYTHING in one place, clearly photographed and explained, and some things I hadn't even thought of! If you are on the fence about &#34;another knitting book&#34; go ahead and take the plunge on this one. I never want it far away from my knitting bag. The patterns in the latter part of the book are many and all look really nice. If you can only get one book on circular knitting, get this one.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|If you enjoy the Beatles & the times of the 60's & 70's & everything from war protests to music to love stories, then you will enjoy this movie!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the book and loved it! The film wasn't what I expected, but I know how hard it must be to make a movie after a book. I think it was very well done. I can't wait for the next one.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I love this game because it is a better bubble game than the others. The only thing that I don't like is that you run out of energy too soon and they want you to buy gems to keep if you are impatient. But I wait until my energy rebuilds so that I can continue.
B00821OX98|4.0|OK plot, some overacting, and slow movement to &#34;fill the hour&#34;, but in general the plot is consistent and engaging - you care about (love or hate) most of the characters.  Poor red eye...
B0091REZMW|5.0|The is my favorite app of all time. I love the kindle version which has just about all adventures, quests, acquiring things, etc. all wrapped up in one game. You will advance faster if you want to spend $ but doesn't any app out there wants to buy diamonds, gems, etc. If you are patient then you have to wait until your energy rebuilds. But the new update has given more items to fall when you banish the monsters or complete quests, or explore a room. I you like to play games that have hidden objects then this your game. The facebook version seems to have more options but I primarily play on my kindle.
B004NELBPC|1.0|yes...horrible.  navigation between categories is extremely annoying. old slider at the top was much easier to use.  font is ridiculously small with no option to enlarge.  no rotation at all, either.  will uninstall.  shame,  I really used to like this app.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game because I love to play real life bingo. I liked that there are a variety of games to play in different ethnicity. I also like that there are collections to acquire as well.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|This couple is just so inspiring to the rest of us want a be singers.  I can not wait for them to produce another album.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have always liked coin dozer especially when there were at the fairs. I know that they were a scam but now I can play without the scam  :)
B005LAIIJY|1.0|This movie sounds great.  By the reviews you would think it was Jackie Brown or Reservoir Dogs.  If you really believe your fellow human beings you might even think it was Pulp Fiction!<br /><br />You would be wrong.<br /><br />QT jumped the shark with From Dusk Till Dawn.  He somewhat redeemed himself with Inglorious Bastards.  This piece of shlock just put him right down where he was already going.  Kill Bill not withstanding.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love dragon story. The team lava brand has a wide variety of games that are fun to play. There is some problems when playing on the kindle compared to the android. Hopefully an update will arrive soon.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|i love this story--saw the original stage play in London; went to see it again when it came to the Kennedy Ctr.<br />This movie (& cast) does it justice; so moving.  My grandaughter is also a fan.
B000QCSA54|5.0|This book was wonderful. I had been feeling dissatisfied, and too afraid to take the chance on something better. It was time for a change, and Seth Godin showed me that the short-term awkward of transitioning to something new versus the long-haul of sticking it out in a job I hate was a no brainer. If you need a push toward taking the dreams you've always wanted and making them come true, this book is for you.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a fabulous app to gather together all your favorite articles and columnists. I have found it's a back-door way into some national newspapers that would ordinarily charge you.....John in San Diego
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Especially chasing people swimming! Very entertaining. It's nice to be the hunter, rather than the hunted.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Watched Lincoln 3 times; each time catching little bits I missed before. I want to learn more about  Lincoln personally and the political times. The filming and photography were very appropriate for the subject and times. I would think every American History teacher in the county is showing this in classes. How interesting history would be for younger generations if teachers would make it personal.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|What more can I say? Graphics are great and the game is great, but the freeze ups ruins everything. Annoying!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Being a huge Rush fan, I was super excited to buy this album. It's amazing!!! The style of the songs is so different compared to earlier albums and shifts into a more blues-folksy kind of style that really works for the concept overall. If you like Vapor Trails and Roll the Bones, you'll love Snakes and Arrows.<br />P.S. The lyrics kick ass, as always.<br /><br />Long live Rush!!!!
B004742Y68|5.0|This is a 'tasteful' horror flick.  It is a little dated and the special effects date it a bit more but it is a classic that I think everyone should see at least once.  The humor is subtle and lightens the mood from time to time.  Good movie overall.
B005PK57NU|5.0|i love that there is a new case in court with every episode..i do think it could develope personal relationships more though.  i love good drama, and i love court shows and i found this show to be written well and interesting enough to keep me coming back for more
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|I don't understand why throwing in a code for a digital copy is supposed to be so desirable. This has been a $7.99 bluray for years. Packing in the DVDs they can't sell doesn't add value either. The only reason we didn't get VHS tapes with DVDs during the format change is because they weren't as easy to repackage.<br /><br />I do highly recommend this movie but only if you watch the series first. I watched this before watching Firefly and didn't really enjoy it as much. This movie is really a series finale. After watching the series first it makes much more sense and the characters have much more depth. You can watch it first but you'll be seeing the ending first.<br /><br />Watch Firefly and then come back to this. There's only like 14 episodes in the series and they have a near movie like production quality. Absolutely worth the time of any SciFi fan.<br /><br />My rating is of the movie not the packaging.<br /><br />Edit: looks like Amazon has divulged more information.  Even more value. It's a steelbook!
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|This is a really great piece of fiction about the Roman Empire.  Some of the older characters are played<br />by people who come out of retirement.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book!! It was, by far, the best if the 3 books and the most thrilling. You will not be dissapointed!!
B0009VSB06|5.0|excelente servicio, 100% de cumplimiento de lo ofrecido.<br />el envio llego en forma y en el tiempo se&ntilde;alado.<br />muchas gracias
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Great songs, from rock n roll to inspirational, Bon Jovi says it all! They've &#34;got it goin' on&#34; as always.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Awesome app.  Don't like the ads.  Other than that the game is sweet.  Need to figure a better way to show ads so they don't make me want to uninstall the app.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book. Very thought provoking. We read it for my book club and I am so glad that we did.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Another app that helps to pass the time when you're waiting on something or somebody. Use it all the time in those situations.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|We read this for my book club. I am glad I read it. I don't think I would have read it if it wasn't for Book Club. It was one of those books that you can't stop thinking about after you read it.
0307477479|2.0|I want so badly to like this book. It contains all the elements which I normally find riveting: lyrical high-mindedness, unconventional metaphors, non-linearity, even music.  The only problem is that I don't give a damn about any of these characters.  Not in the least.  None of them are fleshed out enough to make an impact. I became hopeful at the introduction of the character of Jules and the Suicide Tour, but as soon as my interest was piqued, Egan ends the chapter to focus on the nauseating La Doll/Kitty Jackson/General B storyline. How could this book possibly have won a Pulitzer?  I didn't realize just how much I detested this book until I started writing this review.<br /><br />Also, while I appreciate some of the eccentricities in Egan's writing, I sometimes find myself cringing and actually asking myself, \\"When is this sentence going to end?\\" and similarly during certain chapters.  I want to finish (I'm at about page 170) but when you find yourself feeling that enormous chunks of a book were a complete waste of time, it's probably best to cut your losses and move on to something else.<br /><br />I understand that Goon Squad has gotten rave reviews and I'm happy for the people that enjoyed it, but  isn't for me.  Upgraded from 1 to 2 stars because I appreciate the fact that Egan attempted something different.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I heard so many good things about this show, so when it was available to watch on my Kindle with PRIME, I got hooked!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great insights and helpful examples for self understanding and personal change .the rat illustration was a big help to me in comprehending how the brain works.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|The movie was great, unfortunately, I was disappointed by how Amazon did not have a problem streaming a quarter of the movie in HD and then all of a sudden recalling that it can apparently no longer buffer in HD, thus streaming it in SD for the rest of the movie, and yet charging me for the HD price. Great business practice, I tell you!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|this has been one of my very favorite movies since i was 5.  i was very excited for this diamond edition to come out and it didn't disappoint!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Our 3 year old grandson can now play with his own construction vehicles by the hour, indoor or outdoor.  Perfect for a small child and very durable.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I watched this movie because of a friend's recommendation.  It started slow but it did keep my interest.  I am 60 years old and not a video game player so I may not be the best judge of this movie.  But I did find Ralph and Vanellope appealing characters.
0345529057|3.0|For the first time ever, I'm going to recommend the tv/movie version over the books.  There is just so much detail and people to keep up with, I found myself having to read and reread.  Definitely, not an easy light read.  I think it's a lot due to the fact that there are numerous storylines that the write jumps back and forth and makes the reader have to really focus and keep up with what's going on with who and where and how it all relates.  Even the tv version gets complicated, but it's a bit easier with faces to put with the people.<br /><br />I did however, enjoy watching a season then picking up the book to see how closely they stayed to the original (very close).  It also helped fill in some of the gaps that the show leaves out.<br /><br />Not great, but a nice supplement to the tv show.
B007712XAU|5.0|It was my wife who wanted to see this and I could have cared less. Little did I know that I would love it, probably more than my wife. The story is enthralling and the acting is just perfect. Having now seen seasons 1-3 I am anxiously awaiting season 4.
0525478183|4.0|Another one of Mr. Green's can't put down books.  Well developed and interesting characters that make you want to find out what happens next.  The ending leaves a bit to be desired if you're one of those who wants a nice buttoned up version, but it felt appropriate given the characters you've gotten to know.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 continues the excellence of seasons 1 & 2. See my review of those two which I previosly wrote.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Buenos gr&aacute;ficos y entretenido para ni&ntilde;os hasta 10 a&ntilde;os. Le faltar&iacute;a alguna actualizaci&oacute;n con m&aacute;s niveles. Recomendable. Saludos.<br />buen juego
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I like this game a lot and I've played it on my Android tablets, phones and on Windows so I was happy to see it pop up as the free app of the day so I snatched it up quick like and I'm still enjoying it.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|The sound is the same as I remember... Great music.  Captures a dramatic time in our history.  Would definitely recommend to lovers of good soul searching that was inspired by a transitional period in our country.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Russell Crowe is an amazing actor as is the rest of the headliner cast.  The story is fast-paced and realistic, a perfect blend of romance and action thriller.  One of Russell Crowe's best.  Kevin Spacey at his eclectic best.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Though not a fan of Tom Cruise, I thought he did a good job with the role in this mission possible entry. Plenty of improbable situations that crest and fall throughout the flick sprinkled with humor. Not the best in the series, but certainly one of the more entertaining. I enjoyed it!
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|Good movie for the family.  Had great moral points in showing the characters learning (or not)  the importance of love and friendship.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I thought this would be a puff piece (get it??!?) rather than a warts-and-all documentary. I was wrong. I highly recommend watching this whether you are a fan of Bob's music or not.
B008602KQI|4.0|Of course the book, as well as the series of books tells<br />a more consistant and well knit story, but the movie is<br />interesting to watch with characters brought to life by talented acting.
1426308469|5.0|Or &#34;WOW&#34; as my 2 year old grandson said on seeing this book for the first time. This is a clear, bold children's picture book that is a graduated learning tool as well. The illustrations are all that you would want them to be and the information is there for adults and children to absorb as each stage of learning readiness is reached.
B0081336FO|5.0|Modern spin to classic fiction shows that retelling old tales<br />can still thrill. Brilliant work by superb actors in my opinion.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Love the whole series - great characters - nice spin on magic etc.  I highly recommend these books for any fantasy lover.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />watched this with my 13 year old son.<br />must admit my surprise that he absolutely loves it.<br /><br />some background with regard to my son's interest:<br />we have been watching World of Jenks on MTV.<br />this is a reality show that features an amazing autistic young man named Chad.<br />Chad is our favorite part of watching the show.<br />i was hoping that my son would also find Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man character interesting.<br />home run!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The way this cd flows is definitely a break from the norm of radio cut songs. The lengthy tracks give way to a great musical production by legendary producer Timbaland. I was skeptical but a friend of mine was raving about it. glad I listened....I'm still listening to it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think Subway Surfers is awesome.  I really like the Sydney upgrade. I like all the different characters, especially Kim.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter loves this series.  I enjoy it as well... Greg is quite a character and it's fun to see how he works his way through situations
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version of solitaire!  The options and graphics are awesome! Much better than the previous version I was using
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Great movie for the kids and the grown ups too, excelent for whole family having a good time together. Highly recommend it
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Years ago I saw the very last scene of this movie. It was so intriguing I had to go back and watch the whole thing, even though I knew how it turned out. I still loved it.
B004X4QW42|5.0|This was an exceptional film. A bit of insight into the martial arts master that helped train Bruce Lee( R.I.P.). Lots of action and flurry of fists to keep you entertained. Great film.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|this was my first time reading a book on a kindle,its going to take some time to get use to it,
B008KNUKVI|4.0|I like this album but it is too short. The group has a great sound and the album is a lot of fun to listen too. I am happy I purchased it.
B00004Y6O4|5.0|I HEARD YEARS AGO THAT ROD SAID THAT THIS WAS A LOW PERIOD WHEN HE MADE THIS ALBUM. WELL, LOW OR NOT, I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUMS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT HIS CRITICS SAY.ALL THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE GREAT, BUT I THINK THAT THE TITLE SONG\\"BLONDS HAVE MORE FUN\\" IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM.GREAT, GREAT ALBUM.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Very insightful to better understand the internal desire we share to accomplish valuable work. I like the focus on core principles.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A staggering achievement.  Like no book I'd ever read.  So simple, yet so complex.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.  Read....it....now.  It will move you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of The Walking Dead!  I haven't missed an episode.  You don't have to be a zombie fan to like the walking dead.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can keep in touch with family and find lost friends. I enjoy playing the games. They are entertaining. bit can !be frustrating too
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is great fun.  It moves fast, so have to hurry.  I like that your lives are limited, so I have to turn it off.  Otherwise I would play for too long.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I'm still amazed at the concept.  I find most request that I search for.  Love it when I here a radio song, and can Get the artist.  Incredible!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE IT!  Seasons 1, 2, and 3 were all great.  Can't wait for season 4. Love the acting.  Love the clothing.  It's all good.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Good cards and real fun battles.Also a really good way to pass time.The pvp is also fun but sometimes it takes a bit of time to connect with someone.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|It nice to see something different from the normal good verses evil stuff. It actually shows that it is some gray areas.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|I love this movie. It has a &#34;newsreel&#34; feel to it, which makes it all the more dramatic. A classic movie, and the first one to deal honestly with this topic.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|A beautiful and fanciful film that reels you in and the sets the hook when you least expect it!  Great!
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|I really liked it, tho I think Malick will lose fans because of the lack of dialogue and what many will assume is arrogance on his part
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great show. Missed first two seasons and then watched it On Demand. Ordered Season 3 because it is not available On Demand for some reason.
044042321X|5.0|Visually entertaining book. I like the way they did the characters. It's pretty close to the descriptions in the novel.
B00C0NFMKI|3.0|I thought this album was too similar to others but not special enough.  There were a couple standout songs, and a few that I don't mind, but unfortunately I'd describe half of this album as boring.  I wanted to like it, but it's nothing I'll be listening to years from now like Paramore's last.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Nice quality, rotates when needed or required and fits slightly different width items. I had previously owned one in the past, but a friend liked it so much that I gave it to them as a gift. I re-purchased this a s a replacement. It works well for different flashlights because of the stretch material. Has worked flawlessly when I have rotated my holder with flashlight to use as a hands-free set when working at night and watching my steps. It is lightweight due to the item materiel. Would recommend for normal use.<br /><br />For Law Enforcement and/or Military use I have another favorite, but this will do for civilians.
0060899220|4.0|Thanks to this book, I now know that brunch is the most hated meal in most restauranteur's repertoire, not to order fish on Tuesdays, and just how much crap you can do to your body and still function. The bad boy of the culinary world does not disappoint. Worth a read, even if you think he's an arrogant prick- because he knows his stuff.
B0094M0DJS|5.0|How can anyone not love a sci-fi movie involving the marines, aliens and the destruction of L.A.? SPOILER ALERT: Now that the marines won the battle in the movie, and are driving forward toward the final war, maybe this will give L.A. a real chance to rebuild the forsaken 405, 10 and 5 freeways....if not ....just enjoy the movie.
B000J103PC|4.0|When I had cable and flipped channels this was one of those movies that I stopped on, every time. And loved every time! My favorite sequences are Meryl Streep's amazing monologues about fashion and business, anything with Stanley Tucci in it, and Andy Sachs' (Anne Hathaway) makeover. Ooh, and Emily Blunt, who blew up with this movie! I was so pleased to find it at an affordable price and will watch it again and again- aside from a few stutters, it's a great disc and worth having.<br /><br />That said, this movie is really showing its age.<br /><br />The book it's based on came out in 2003 and the movie in 2006- both pre-economic crisis. Even the book was a rough go for me, because I found the protagonist a hair irritating. And this is coming from someone who wanted, and still wants, to be a writer. Both book and movie get one crucial detail right: How very hard it is to convince parents and friends that while your pay sucks now, and you're not doing what you want to do at the moment, that paying your dues and getting known is a big part of building that career as a writer.<br /><br />But frankly I watched this and wasn't rooting for Andy Sachs at all. I was rooting for Miranda Priestly (rumored to be Vogue's Anna Wintour) to break her. Miranda is supposed to come across as acerbic, cruel, and awful (and is all of those things, but less so than in the novel), but really she's just a professional woman who, in order to maintain her status as a fashion-savvy industry powerhouse, needs to be surrounded by willing, capable people who are as engaged as she is. If Weisberger/Andy had just been willing to engage and show some effort, she might have been less frustrated and ultimately left on better terms. As it was, I started reading the book/watching the movie the first time ready to root for Andy, but in the end? Didn't.<br /><br />Another reason I find this movie/book frustrating is that because these days people take all kinds of ill-fitting jobs just to pay rent, and clearly Weisberger, and her character, did not want this job. And so they shouldn't have taken it. I, personally, would have been one of those millions of girls who would kill for the job of assistant to a major fashion editor. And every time Hathaway rolled her eyes or sighed or there was a speech about being true to one's self, I wanted to throw something breakable.<br /><br />If she'd wanted to be true to herself, she wouldn't have taken the damn job in the first place. The little scene they wrote for the movie of Miranda and Andy acknowledging each other in a city street was nice. I still can't believe that Miranda would recommend Andy for anything after Andy's behavior, but if she did in real life, Wintour is an even better person than Weisberger deserved her to be, if that makes sense.<br /><br />That said, I like this movie and I'm happy to have a copy. I will enjoy my favorite scenes, wish I had Emily Blunt's makeup artist (that turquoise eye shadow!) those Chanel boots and access to the schwag closet, and a mentor like Stanley Tucci, but in the end I'm left confused about who to root for.<br /><br />BTW: If you like Vogue and the references in the movie about the September issue mean something to you, then pick up a copy of RJ Cutler-directed &#34;The September Issue&#34;- the Sundance doc about Wintour's relationship with her art director as they put together the yearly fashion bible.learly Weisberger, and her character, did not want this job.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Found it fast reading..the tumultuos part when the husband is stalking her was riveting and scary..glad all ended well..Wonder if she stayed KATE or went back to Erin!!!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I never saw this in theaters, but finally the cable version hooked me in, so I bought this to add to my holiday movie collection.<br /><br />This is the perfect omnibus movie- all of the stories intertwine and are tied up at the end. And what's neat is that the more time passes, the more relevant each actor becomes to the viewer and the more you will enjoy rewatching it. And where else are you going to get such a great ensemble?<br /><br />And getting it at such a low price? WIN.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After the boring 2nd season, this season is amazing. Suspenseful and exciting, I never know what is going to happen.
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|Yup. I said that. I'm a fan of McAvoy, Angelina Jolie in Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and director Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch/Day Watch, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) so this is a match made in heaven for me.<br /><br />McAvoy plays a hapless office worker who finds out he's part of an elite group of assassins. To say more would give it away, but suffice it to say he comes into his own (and there are some really cheer-worthy \\"EFF YOU!\\" moments).<br /><br />Bekmambetov is known for over-the-top action sequences and Wanted has no shortage of them: From the tops of trains to acrobatic car chases, and looping bullets, it's all unbelievably believable. You watch, you think \\"NO WAY!\\" but a little voice at the back of your head says, \\"But maybe 'way'\\". Angelina Jolie is spot-on as Fox- beautiful, a little scary, and able to kick ass with style.<br /><br />Saw it in theaters and pleased to have a copy to watch whenever. Great fun!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I have to admit I have not played because it took so much space to download, I stopped the download.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Okay, I admit it: I'm a fan. I read the books way back when (and for the record, they were awful- but *very* engaging and still WAY better then 'Twilight'), and I was excited about the show. I didn't care that Elena went from blond to brunette and had a brother instead of a sister, and the Salvatores were from Virginia instead of Italy, I was just psyched to see the triangle up on screen. Season 1 got off to a shaky start, but did not disappoint.<br /><br />Season 2, on the other hand, is not only \\"not disappointing\\", but has some really great episodes. One of the running themes is the evolution of Caroline's character and her friendship with Stefan, which mirrors his relationship with Lexi.<br /><br />In the opener, Caroline, is turned into a vampire and gains a small measure of revenge on Damon for his mistreatment of her when he first comes into town (#1 \\"The Return\\"). It's amazing to watch Caroline grow a spine along with her fangs and I found myself rooting for her alongside the two brothers and Elena. Another one of my faves is #6 \\"Plan B\\", in which Jeremy struggles to become part of Mystic Falls' new world order and Damon and Katherine reveal just how ruthless they are. There's also the introduction of Rose (#8 \\"Rose\\") who gets Damon to show his softer side. Katherine's back story is featured (#9 \\"Katerina\\") which gave Nina Dobrev a chance to really shine- I think she got her People's Choice award for her work in Season 2, actually. There's also the first of many wonderful episodes showing how Lexi influenced the brothers and the relationship between Elena and Original Elijah (#15 \\"The Dinner Party\\"). The finale (#22 \\"As I Lay Dying\\") which is a neat little full-circle move showing that what happened to Jeremy in the first episode (and the Season 1 finale) had consequences,<br /><br />If you're a fan of the show, and like rewatching for nuance and characterization, this is worth owning.
0345803493|5.0|saved me more money then I would have spent.. loved the book.. would reccommend it to anyone.. thank you very much..
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have a 1st gen Kindle Fire and installed this during a trip out West. It came in handy on numerous occasions- taking notes on dishes in restaurants, ideas for novels, lists of places people recommended to me, etc. Good thing to have!
0920668372|5.0|I got this book for my son about 16 years ago.  I made up a tune to go to the song.  To this day I will sing it to him sometimes and he is 22.  In fact I just purchased this book for my daughters baby.  And I took a photo of the cover and sent it to my son and asked does he remember this book and he said of course I do.<br />Its kind of hoky story but soooo sweet and what every mom would love.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|As I age, I admit it- it's fun to see even older people play action heroes.<br /><br />This has a great plot, based on a graphic novel, about a group of retired assassins who come out of the shadows to create mayhem one last time. But unlike other attempts at a similar story (*koff*EXPENDABLES*koff*) there's more there. There are characters being developed and plots and turns and twists, and Helen Mirren with a machine gun. And Karl Urban, who can make a bloody nose look good. Better than it should, in fact. And he fights in a suit. How can you not love that?<br /><br />And I don't ever remember liking Bruce Willis as much as when I saw this. There's supposed to be a sequel out soon- you can bet I'll be in line for that one. And ordering up the DVD after.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game was tons of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it. The graphics are beautiful, and really add to the game.
1452101248|4.0|I borrowed this from someone and then purchased it for someone else. It arrived in good shape in plenty of time to be given as a gift.<br /><br />A few things that stand out: The cover is marvelously squishy and appealing to handle, the recipes are easy and not too weird, and if you're an avowed carnivore you will STILL find something good in here. While Ottolenghi champions veggies in this book, he himself eats meat as well, and has no issue with either choice.<br /><br />NOTE: this retails for $15 more at B&N.
0761169431|5.0|This is an awesome book.  Keeps my child engaged for hours.  It's really well organized from easiest to hardest.  Makes a great gift.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|The Blues do not get much better than this! I have been a Charile Musselwhite fan for years. And Ben Harper Shine's on this one.
B0031R5K72|5.0|I just finished reading this book and i have to say this isn't going to be the only time. To say more would be futile, this book has been a worthy companion.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I liked this game but it freezes sometimes but will still recommend it and even then it deserves 5stars.  Thank you
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I always feel like I am being entertained and learn a little about the legal system when I read one of Grisham's books.  John Grisham always crafts an interesting story which can be read in a few hours.  They make for a quick plane ride.
0452273331|5.0|The characters in this book are just as or maybe more relevant today as they were when the book was written.  Peter Keteting is most despicable and a sad portrayal of so many today.  He is a mere jelly fish receiving his life's energy from outside his soul.  His soul has shrunk up and disappeared.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|Wouldn't have been a half bad movie if it weren't for the music to remind you have lame it is.
B007V65R54|5.0|As a physicist I usually hate books that about math that don't use math, but this one works very very well. The most important reason to read this book is to get a New York Times level of explanation about my some predictions can be trusted (eg US Weather bureau but not Weather CHannel) and why...
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I believe this movie should have stayed separate from the previous 'Alien' films. Instead of inquiring into the origins of human life, the discovered human progenitor says nothing and immediately kills those who long for these answers that only in the end makes this film another mediocre horror flick.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|As with most/all Quentin Tarantino films, this film is bloody and violent. It depicts the hatred toward the National Socialist Party (Nazis) and an imaginative end of WWII. This feel has great acting, vivid emotions, and despite its dark humor is a comedy. This is a great film if you like Quentin Tarantino and want an imaginative opinion on the Second World War.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to use, nice feature to be able to leave your spouse a message, or a reminder for yourself! Upgraded for $0.99, not a bad deal at all! Way better than a stupid clock you would buy at Walmart.
B004478AS4|4.0|This story carried me far from how we grew up in America to a very primitive life in an African village.<br />I got a real sense of  the language and the customs along with the mental strengths and weaknesses of growing and living in a primitive social group.<br />The story flows well and I found it quite compelling.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It has been a long time since I found a book this suspenseful.  Is it great literature?  No.  But, wow, is it a great vacation/summer beach read.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is fun and challenging too. I had tried this game while I was looking at different tablets and I had to download it when I finally got mine. So much fun.
B00340LM8C|5.0|A great &#34;who dun it&#34; by that classic director, Alfred Hitchcock.  Not a horror flick.  It has glamor, suspense,beautiful locations and more!  If you are a fan of this genre you will not be disappointed.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I had to replace my DVD, since the first one walked away. I was very pleased with the speed in which I received this one, and the price was fair.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was entertaining and the story had a good twist at the end.  It was a love story with an interesting story line.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Another great Bond movie! Daniel Craig is great as Jason Bond. It was an intense and very interesting story line (now that sounds generic, but do not want to SPOIL it for anyone).
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love, war, romance, murder, mind games, deception and betrayal. This miniseries has it all. Well worth the time to watch.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I think out of all the seasons, this one had me on the edge of my seat the most.  Very action packed and emotional!
B004W2UBYW|1.0|I am slogging through this book for book club and now I hate Steve Jobs.  He was a bully who came up with some great ideas.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|This an excellent story, masterfully told. From the first sentence the author captured my imagination and kept me fascinated throughout. It is not only because it is factual, but also his masterful, almost poetic  writing skills.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm seriously addicted to this show!  I'm going to have to watch it from beginning to end over and over just to get my fix!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|No issues it worked perfect, would recommend this to everyone looking for something like this. Very happy with this purchase
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is good for what it is worth but what about the neither which all the other versions had from the very beginning,you can't even mine Red stone and there aren't any useful items except four weapons and armour.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|No issues it worked perfect, would recommend this to everyone looking for something like this. Very happy with this purchase
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like to be able to instantly pull up current conditions and at the same time get a future forcast.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|I had issues controling the cube on my screen effectively, couldn't get it to stop/move the way I needed it to, frustrating
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This is a fabulous movie, unexpected and beautiful.  I heard about it from some Europeans while in China last summer, and watched it on the plane on my way back to the states.  Couldn't order it for six months; I was so frustrated!!!  Definitely makes my short-list of movies worth purchasing--
B004SBS8LA|4.0|No issues it worked perfect, would recommend this to everyone looking for something like this. Very happy with this purchase
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I think this movie is hilarious, but be warned -- I love dry humor, English humor, subtle humor...this is not for the Will Farrel lovers of the world.  It's British, though, what do you expect?  Full of layers of story that are funny because they're real (things that happen in real life), and they happen every day--  I loved it.  And now I own it.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|No issues it worked perfect, would recommend this to everyone looking for something like this. Very happy with this purchase
1574214276|5.0|Lots of great patterns to inspire the art of Zentangle. Plus easy to follow directions. I use it every time I Zentangle.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I really liked it I kind of wished there was a little more to the ending. Like now that the secret is out, everyone is home happy and well what's life going to be like now? An epilogue would have even done it. But other than the lack of ending it was great! Off to take a peek at the movie.
B001N4TIHI|5.0|All of the actors are funny and I love all of them indiviually, but put them all together and it's sensational.  I laughed, cried, cheered and experienced every form of emotion.
B00AWE9TCE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2ZUOWN6R163D]]This is one sweet Lego set. I've watched a few videos online to see what it was all about and can say that it's even more amazing than I thought now that I actually have it. I even kind of feel guilty for buying it knowing that I in a way have deprived some kid from the joy of building and ultimately playing with it. It's pretty awesome. I'm going to let my inner child out a little and have some fun though. I'm eyeing some mini figs that could use a missle up side the head. It was extremely fun to build and pretty easy as with every Lego set I have ever bought.<br />I love the whole 'vehicle shaped like the driver' thing going on with the Chima sets. This is the first I have bought from this series and I chose this one because I like the look of the eagle vehicles... As I was writing that last line the UPS guy just delivered the Eagle Interceptor which is the jet vehicle. YES!! Anyway this is the tank and in my opinion when viewing it a certain way looks like an eagle swooping in for the kill. I think it's how the talons were designed and positioned that make me think this way. I love the look of this thing. The playability is really great too. As I said it has missles and not just one but two! And it's not the flick missles. These are the strong spring loaded ones. Just push the red button and ssss kaboom! The wings that they are attached to are adjustable as well. You can of course push it along on its tank treads and its one rubber wheel. Having this one rubber wheel in the back sets it apart from any other tank design I have ever seen. Well that and of course the whole looking like an eagle thing. Also when you push the red button above the big wheel at the back of the tank the cockpit will be ejected (quite easily I must say)from the front of the tank. This would be useful for maybe some air recon or if say the tank was about to explode it would be an ideal escape pod. It comes with three mini figs. Two of the eagles and one of the wolves. As a side note I plan on buying the wolf vehicle that looks like a wolves head. Anyway I will not go on anymore except to say that I absolutey recommend this and invite you to check it out for yourself in my video.<br /><br />Luke and R2 were not hurt during the making of the video. Their made of plastic people.
0521707803|5.0|i love this book, is very useful, and everything is very clear and easy to study and understand. I will recommend this book 100%
B008B9JSD2|3.0|I thought it was charming but it lists as a comedy. All I can say is that Italian comedy is very different from American comedy. Maybe that's good!
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|Would watch this movie again. It had a great story and a positive plot which is great for kids. Recommend!
B005DOKM9M|3.0|Would be nice if it had a pocket or two and place for pen or pencil. Also would be nice if kindle locked in to the case and you didn't have to take it out to use it.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book back when I was in highschool and I absolutely love it. Now that I have my own money to spend I was able to add this book to my collection. It's just as I remember it and it is awesome.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|It is always a relief not to have the usual stress, violence and over-paced American film.  Lincoln sticks to a steady, slow telling of the times, and does it well.  It is not a movie you will never forget, but it is one everyone must see, especially to understand the roots of the North vs. South conflict that led to the Civil War, and the inequities of economic development afterwards.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Works ok but oddly whenever I download this app to my kindle all my favorites disappear. Then when it's uninstalled the favorites come back. Also it's impossible to deactivate accounts incredibly frustrating.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|I had the vinyl version of this 40 years ago and I loved it then.  I heard a song from this album on the radio and it reminded me of how much I liked it but I didn't have it in my mP3 files.  So I bought the CD and ripped it to my Itunes.  The CD was a bargain since it had almost twice as many songs as the original vinyl album and now I can hear the maestro in even more variety of one of the top 100 albums of all time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. I come home from work and play it everyday. I even play before bed to unlock all kinds of new stuff. Much better then temple run. Love it!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy is a good read.  The seeds of political intrigue that were planted in the first book (Hunger Games) grow.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I watched this movie in the movies and it is based on the movie! So you should  buy it! :D LOL
B0043U7XJO|1.0|I was excited to watch the movie, but pretty much found it to be slapped together from the get-go.  The music score never hit its mark and always felt out of sync.  It did nothing to increase anticipation or raise my emotions.  The editing was awful.  The movie jumped around from one scene to the next.  There was never any lead up to a scene, you were just dumped into it on the fly.  I always felt like I just missed the scene that set up the one I was watching.  Good cast, which really shocked me considering how bad the movie ended up being.  I now understand how important good editing and scoring are.<br /><br />I unfortunately watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better.  It didn't....
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Love it! A good romp in the wilder reaches. Strong characters even the cameos. If you don't have it get it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|loved it. Makes me want to hike the trail. Good writing skills and descriptions. Looking forward to reading her next book.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|I'd give the album itself 4.5 stars. I think everyone else has commented pretty well on the quality of the album. I've had it on repeat since they started streaming it a week ago. It's a solid record though it diverges in style from the past. You can get more on the music in the other reviews.<br /><br />My gripes all lie with the actual CD case. It's just cardboard. The shape doesn't match most CD cases and its pockets are in a weird spot that make pulling out the CD difficult. The lyrics/CD book isn't bad, but I might as well have gotten the digital booklet. I don't know how important cases are to you, but if you like keeping them, save yourself $2 and and a wait - just grab the mp3 of the album. The trees will thank you at least.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Great read.  Agree with many points, disagree with a few, but a good look at alternate methods of child rearing.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Enjoyed this, very interesting with real characters and and interesting world.  Left me wanted to jump into the second immediately.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Tommy Lee can do no wrong in my book! I'm sure for some,it will seem sort of corny, but I liked it.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I am a fan of The Who and I was not disappointed. recommended for all rock fans, especially about the band
B009IUH1N2|3.0|Es entretenido y retador, aunque llega a ser un poco repetitivo. Bueno para pasar unos minutos.<br />Esta OK para ser gratis.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|We only began watching White Collar when it appeared as repeats on our antenna TV.  Thoroughly captivated by the slights of hand, we ordered the first three seasons.  We especially enjoy the quirky characters!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is a beautifully written book.  The author's courage and strength are unparalleled.  She tells her story in a beautiful way.
B007NESBK2|5.0|If you can't catch Sade in a live concert you must buy this DVD.I would say that everyone buy one.Love it.
B000TENK4K|5.0|I love Daft Punk and this track has some pretty interesting songs on it.  These are good songs to listen to when you want to get motivated to work.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Very enjoyable album not quite as rock and roll as previous albums, more of blues variety but it was good to listen to.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|John Carpenter's Halloween is by far the horror movie that has stayed with me consistently since the first time I watched it. I love everything about it. This movie introduced me to one of my all time favorite directors, John Carpenter. I just think it is absolutely masterful. From that iconic jack o'lantern in the titles to that very last spooky montage at the end.<br /><br />This blu ray is excellent. I love the fact that there's a commentary track with John Carpenter, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis (my dvd of the movie doesn't have that) and I love the featurette.<br /><br />An absolute must have for anyone who appreciates the horror genre.
B004DMNT2W|1.0|Ths case arrived with a thick film of dust on it. I literary washed it before use. The price was too good to send back. Supports a small palm camera nicely.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|I didn't like the slow pace of startup. The game was pretty fun but lacked some game play elements that would make it more interesting. The game client was excellent as one would expect from Gameloft.
B008Q0AZVK|2.0|Did not really keep my interest.  Just didn't care for the story.  Poor boy that is good with women, trying to manipulate his way to the top of society.  Not my idea for a great movie.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I like vampire movies and this is very good with the plot twists. I enjoy movies that have a lot of intrigue in them.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This is a truly fun game that you can spend hours playing. There is tons of free puzzles to choose from. But every time I close the app out and try to restart it a message pops up and says it has stopped working. It completely frustrating because you loose the puzzle you've been working on. All in all it an ok game.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|My wife and Ii put off watching this very well done movie for far too long.  It will make you laugh and it is VERY well done, from the story line to the the fantactic scenes.  Like the sykline of France.  You'll love it.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|I bought this movie for my 10 month old daughter to watch she didn't watch much so I picked up where she left off and loved it! If I closed my eyes it actually sounded like I was right next to the birds the audio quality was unbelievable and I would definitely recommend this movie to any age audience
B00C32TPZE|5.0|This is certainly Volbeats best album. Been a fan since last January and have everything they've done. Waited patiently for this album and it is not a disappointment. From Lets Shake Some Dust to Our Loved Ones, amazing. My Favorites are Lola Montez, Cape Of Our Hero, Our Loved Ones and Lonesome Rider with Sara Blackwood. If you haven't bought it yet, but it soon. I'll be seeing them May 1 at House Of Blues Boston. Can't wait.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It's a pretty fun app, and it helps when I need to make sure my notes are correct! yay piano!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|The Strange Case Of... supplies a mix of driving and soft tracks with compelling lyrics riding strong vocals and fresh music with strains of classic rock.  The album is one of those sought after cases of songs that can get stuck in your head and not make you end up hating them.  For once I agree with the critics, for my tastes Halestorm has earned it's award winning status.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was absolutely brilliant. My favorite King book ever!!  I couldn't put it down!  I loved every word of it!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|My husband and I like to try and beat each other's score. Unfortunately, it is easy to proceed to the next level and once you get to the end, that's it. But, again, you can go back and try beating your time in the different level. They are challenging as it is. can't go wrong with the price either.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|historically acurate but slow moving, I wouldn't recommend viewing it, just a waste of money.  Acting was good but movie was not &#34;Oscar&#34; caliber in my opinion
B00APJLX8E|5.0|I don't buy every kid's movie that comes out. This movie is unique and very kid friendly. I'm a mom of 2 boys, 6 and 9 yrs, and ALL of us enjoy this movie. Lots of kid and adult humor.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun easy relaxing game  five stars to the developers.  Recommend for light entertainment.  Appropriate for all ages even very young.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Both my husband and I turned 40 this year and although we don't have the $$$ like they do in the movie, too many sceniorios hit close to home. Okay to watch but if you were expecting laughs like you did in &#34;Knocked Up&#34;, you'll be disappointed. I love these 2 actors, and if you like them in other movies, you'll like this.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Everybody who wants to open a new small business has to read it! Excellent tool who help you to understand how to organize your corporation,  how to  choose your employees, and what will be your position.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very challenging Spider Solitaire game. 2 suit games are difficult to win . Keep trying and you'll succeed at conquering this version of Spider Solitaire
B0058RCVYS|5.0|very interesting plot.  excellent cast.  really enjoyed the entire movie. will look for more by this director in the future
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My two year old daughter likes to walk around the house holding one of our smaller cast iron skillet. She's a blonde
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This sharpener works good! It is small enough to carry in the field for all of your knife sharpening needs.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I bought this for my kindle to read fpr the book club.  Its a fast read and a very interesting one. Don't want to spoil it for yu with a plot summery
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|My husband requested this as a birthday gift even though we are approaching our thirties.  He wanted it for nostalgic purposes & was shocked to hear that I had never seen it before.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  I'll probably watch it with my younger cousins sometime soon.  The visual & audio quality is great.
B004GUSG4M|1.0|By the time I read 20%, I was ready to return the book. It was slow, boring, and repetitive. I re-read the reviews and people said the ending was great so I continued to read it. I wish I hadn't listened to them. It was a complete waste of time. I hate to be so harsh but if this writer can get so many good reviews, I think I'm going to try writing my own book.<br /><br />In other words, don't waste your time. It'll bore you and the ending is way too unbelievable.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I can't say I have the motivation to use it 30 days in a row but that's my own fault.  I stopped using it recently because I was getting lower back pain but I don't really blame Jillian for that issue.  Everyone's different so I just need to figure out when to stop & replace crunches with something else.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app. Has very loud very good alarm. Highly good & highly recommend this alarm. Since I have a hard time waking up, this is Great!  & wakes me up on time. I love this alarm
B0027CNFR4|2.0|I really disliked the sequel - it was silly and lacking in any genuine humor.  The original movie was charming and from what I've read the majority would agree.  Even so, the Edge of Reason is the version always available in streaming, Amazon, Netflix or Cable.  Makes no sense to me.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Mathew has a thick accent and subtitles are needed to catch every detail of the movie drama. Amazon should include subtitles in its options.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|We are always looking for good family movies- This is one of our favorites.  They kids would watch this over and over again!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The blu ray is awesome. video quality as well as the audio. one of the best in this time period of my life.7 stars
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Great voice and good licks! This album is everything I thought it would be and them some. If you like female vocalists then don't pass on Kimbra!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|This app is solid, but does have minor flaws.  First, the good.  I've only seen one glitch, once, and it was that the page turn function stopped working.  I exited the app, entered again, and I never had the problem again.  There are also a ton of features like not adding, bookmarks, page search, and a bunch of other features that I haven't even used yet.  You can customize many things, which is also a plus.  I especially like the fact that the recent documents is set up like a book case.  Since I use this on my kindle for pdf versions of books it looks like a mini library because it displays the outer covers on a wooden book case.  There is also an image viewer so that you can read downloaded comic books and alike.<br /><br />As far as things not done so well...  The help menu is nonexistent.  You will have to figure out how to use the countless features by trial and error.  Even when you are staring at a button icon you probably won't know what it is for until you use it because none of the button icons have text labels, and long pressing them doesn't bring up a description either.  The other issue is the page search option.  Many books don't count the outer cover and foreword pages as numbered pages, but this app does.  That means that if you try to skip to page 90 that you may end up on 93 or 96.  This is especially problematic for me since I have a song book on here where many songs take up two pages.  In order to get to song 87 I have to go to page 118.  That is a unique issue though.<br /><br />All and all this is a good, solid app that is definitely worth the asking price (especially at 50% off).
B00280LYIM|5.0|Loved it.Loved it.Loved it.  From beginning to end.  It builds up great to the last book in the series :)
1609611543|5.0|Great book has lots of ideas why people get sick from eating wheat!! This is a must buy!! If you get bloated after eating you must read this book!!
B000FA675C|5.0|Once you start, you can't stop until the end.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  One of Dan Brown's best books.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Purchased as an Easter gift for my mother, difficult to find nice movies for her as she does not like violence, blood or sex in movies which does l4ave many movies to buy for her!  She liked it!
B003U6BE8I|2.0|If they are going to make a movie based on a book, the least they can do is read the book.  If you are going to make up your own storyline which is about 80% diff, just name the movie something else.  I understand that movies are not 100% like a book, it's impossible.  But come on, at least respect the characters and the core of their personalities  O_o
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I purchased this for my mother, she loves Tinker Bell and has all the movies, although this is not about her specifically, she called the commercial for it came on.  She enjoyed it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read it in 2 days!!  Couldn't put it down.  Loved all the quirky characters.  Unique approach to a love story.  Will definitely be recommending!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|For anyone who like me is a fan of NCIS, you have to not only like but love all the episodes, all the seasons.  For the episodes I missed for one reason or another, it's wonderful that you can get them direct from Amazon.  I really like how quickly the two episodes I ordered downloaded and the quality of the video and audio was excellent - and no commercials!  Yeah!!  I plan on doing this for not only NCIS but other shows as well.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Season 2 was not quite as good as Season 1, but they did set it up for a lot of excitement to come in Season 3!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  I have always had great respect for the men and women in our Armed Forces.  After reading this I have never been more proud to be an American. God Bless You and your fallen brothers Marcus Luttrell.
0385535147|5.0|ANOTHER JOHN GRISHAM NOVEL, AAAAAAAAA+++++++++..great novel just like most Grishams books very hard to put down,<br /><br />enjoyed this novel like others
B004N0I3U2|5.0|My favorite 007s are<br /><br />The spy who loves me ~ cool car<br />The living daylight ~ cool car<br />And Goldeneye ~ cool Tank lol.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This cd and dvd combo is great. The way it's put together. I just love to watch the dvd over and over again. Big fan of MJ.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Yes, I received my delivery of the Passiones CD. It arrived quickly and safely. It is a gift, so I did not open it, but it looked like it was perfect and had all the appropriate wrapping on it. I am very happy with the order and how quickly it was shipped. Thank you so much for your service.Respectfully, Stefanie Rhodes
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I just love all the songs on this cd. Can't play it enough. Real MJ fan. I would recommend getting this cd. Very good
B000069AUI|5.0|If you´re a Coldplay fan, you must have this in your collection, I enjoyed almost every song, but dont let the ones that arent for everybody let you down or consider another album...this is the one!!!
B009DJB8I2|1.0|I bought 2 cases, one had both codes in it. while for the other it did not. Both bought from Various artists.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best scripted and acted program that I have seen in a long time. I'm hooked on this show and I cannot wait to see the next season
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Don't believe the hype you see on TV. I did and I regret it with each use. I have a vacuum cleaner, but it's not always needed to pick up lint or a few scards of paper. You can spend the afternoon trying to pick up lint, going over the same lint over and over; only to have to pick it up again somewhere else. Alot of times I wind up picking it up with my hand. I have had it for about a year and have also found the handle not able to handle such light duty. I've had to replace the handle and a battery. Don't ask me \\"Y\\". Just say \\"I'm A FOOL for punishment. The new battery most have been used because it has already gone dead after a few months. That's why I'm here at Amazon getting reviews BEFORE I BUY. To anyone who buys one, I say \\" See ya later sucka\\"
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I have always been a fan of Justin, this album is very good.  Mirrors is my new favorite song from the album.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I gave American Horror 5 starts because there were no more stars to give.  It's well written, the actors are extremely professional... and Jessica Lange is incredible!!! She is a great actress.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Still one of the top guitar singer/songwriter/performers. Recently saw him with CSN and he still can play well. Great compilation spanning his different periods of music.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I usually hate when movies are remade, but this one surprised me. It is a better movie than I thought it would be, and I enjoyed it. Still true to the original, yet contemporary, and I think kids today will relate to it like people in the 80's did to the original. I liked that this version touches on different genres of music, and doesn't just focus on one like the original does. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original, or anyone just looking to watch a good dance movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This  is a great game. I have always enjoyed these types of games. It also makes you take your time and slowly build everything. It's nice but sometimes it becomes long but I am patient.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Rodriguez's lyrics still ring valid in today's world. Catchy tunes with crafty guitar work. Just one of many of Detroit's undiscovered musicians I'm sure.
B004EF65QA|4.0|I really enjoyed this miniseries! Wish it had been longer...  the sets were wonderfully done--the factory was amazing.  The actors all did a good job....  While some parts of the storyline were a bit predictable, there were enough little twists and turns to hold your iinterest..  Worth the watch.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Using this with my iPhone 4 and a Sony Bravia.. I couldn't get proper TV-out for some apps. I do realize thought that my phone model does not allow mirroring, and I also know that my particular TV model has some troubles with showing 720p. I could not get video output for the YouTube app, and had to use FoxTube to get YT videos to play on TV. When I get messages on the iPhone it disrupts the video to the screen.<br /><br />Using this for playing games may be a little difficult because the adapter is not very flexible and it may get in the way.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I've not been a big Paramore fan, in the past, but since Haley Williams' guest appearance on B.O.B's hit song \\"Airplanes\\"; I've been 100% hooked on her voice. So here I am. I've had a listen to this ALBUM and it's sheer genius. They've managed to fit some pop, ska, punk-rock and hard rock ALL together [nicely] into one awesome package. It's a GREAT ALBUM!. Plus Haley's VOICE just can't be denied.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|this game is really fun but I wish that not almost everything cost diamonds because you can't get them easily. Also it is very hard to get a house because they all cost diamonds! You can't buy pets if you don't have a house.
B008S8PPPG|4.0|I didn't know who Jessie Ware was until yesterday. I saw her video on MTV (for \\"Wildest Moments\\") and decided from there to give the album a listen and I was not disappointed. What a voice! What composition! I'd read a review somewhere that said she's the perfect mix between Sade and Adele and I have to agree 100%. When those Brits do it; they get IT RIGHT! I love her voice and I love the album. Simpy Wonderful!
0767827902|5.0|Way before its time before nudity was the vogue.  Acting professional all around.  Great story.  Brought back memories of many years ago.  Did not want it to end.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Absolutely love watching this series.  It is over-the-top, gory, enthralling and oh so wonderful.<br />Fell in love with the Gannicus character as soon as he strutted into the arena.<br />Gods of the Arena is solid entertainment.<br />BRAVISSIMO!!!!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The best wise-cracking narrator since Travis McGee.  Mark Watney (the Martian) is a memorable, sympathetic character who produces more chuckles per death-defying moment than I would have thought possible.  Can't comment on the accuracy of the science or engineering, but it certainly SOUNDS believable.  Besides, who cares ... it's a great adventure tale in the tradition of Robinson Crusoe, highlighted by fast-paced, humorous narration.  Great job, Mr. Weir. MORE!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you have anyone that is close to dying, it gives you real peace of mind that there is something after death.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The series is very well written.  Finally a show my boyfriend and I can agree on! Can't wait for season 3.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I missed this episode so I ended up buying it so I could catch up.  I had a little trouble at first figuring out how to download/play the episode, but once I figured it out everything went perfectly and I got to watch one of my favorite shows.
1439102813|5.0|There are so many wonderful things that I could say about this book.  I hate reviews that give another synopsis of the book, so I try to just explaining why I gave the rating.  I would recommend that everyone read this book.  Chances are, at some point, you are going to have someone in your life with similar struggles to Alice.  This book paints a perfect picture of what these struggles can be like for everyone involved.<br /><br />If you have or had a loved one struggle with any form of dementia, I think you will feel the full depths of emotions that this book explores.  You will relate to all of the characters in the book as they struggle to cope with Alice's reality.  Alice is even easy to relate to, which can be terrifying if you're a hypochondriac, like me.<br /><br />I found myself laughing and crying throughout the book.  It was a struggle for me to read this book at times because it was so real.  My mother had battled cancer and recently passed away.  Although she did not suffer from Alzheimer's Disease, cancer and the cancer treatments had taken their tolls on her.  She struggled with similar symptoms and often had similar needs to Alice.<br /><br />I wish I had read this book while/before my mother was sick. It would have reminded me to think about things through her point of view. It was heartbreaking for me to watch her lose herself, but I sometimes forgot to think about how it must have been 100x more difficult for her to know she was losing herself.<br /><br />For those of us who can empathize, this book is definitely powerful.  It's a reminder of how fragile and fleeting life can be for everyone.  I read this book for a book club, and I found it difficult to discuss because it had been such a personal read for me.
0671015206|1.0|You already know what is in this book, the story is stale and uninspired.  Should have spent the money on something else.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Very exciting and captivating series. Kevin Bacon is excellent and the storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat. Recommend!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This is a great movie for our family of Wes Anderson fans.  And the only one the younger kids can watch with us.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book if you like a twist at the end. It was like looking into the minds of two different people. Both of who are unbalanced.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|This is a great movie. I love the detail to fashion for the time period in the movie, which is late sixties to early seventies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really love this book.<br />It's kinda confusing. but remember - it's all letters.<br />As in, its dear this, and dear that - so don't think you're reading it wrong.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I think Flynn is near the top of the fiction writers that I read. Always look forward to his next book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Unrealistic but a good psychological study of human favor. Would have preferred a different ending. This one made me wonder if there would be a sequel. Met the author - a real treat!!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|OK but not really good. Didn't feel it was that well written. It got better in the second half. That's about it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book has an amazing ending that most people don't get to because they stop in the missionaries they thought the beginning was boring but read the whole whole book it has an amazing exiting and sad ending. I would suggest this book to big fans of the Hunger Games  books and need an exiting ending  to sum up the trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book was so predictable and boring. It just was not a fun read. A waste of time for me.
1609611543|5.0|This book has been really helpful and interesting.  We have all made changes to the way we normally eat and no longer assume what mass marketing tells us to be accurate.  There is a definite misunderstanding about gluten and wheat thatthis reference explains really well. Weight loss is a nice benefit, but just feeling overall better after eating is worth it in itself.
1599218011|5.0|This author inspires me so much that I began to follow her blog.  She is down to earth and real.  Her story makes me want to tell my own!  Her diets may seem extreme to some, but if done correctly, I think she can really change lives.
B0019RO4NW|5.0|This documentary about Gilliam's Don Quixote is almost a reflection of the book itself, and the strange, tragic and absurd coming together to the detriment of the filmmaker.
B0042816YK|4.0|This movie was a good overview of the book, but I noticed some differences in the storyline.  I absolutely adore the book, so maybe I am a little biased.  I do still watch the movie over and over though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the series. Sometimes it would have to reload, but what a great show! I am waiting for the 3rd season to come out.
B00006JU7T|5.0|There is not one neg. thing I can say about this. I love Al Pacino so was very happy to get this cd in great condition and so fast. Thank you.
B0091REZMW|5.0|eh its pretty addicting but energy doesn't charge fast enough and diamonds are wayyyy to hard to get and too important
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I read this book before I read Ender's Game and had no problem following along with Ender as an adult.  I love this book because of how sad it is; as to say, if you're looking for a book that's all smiles, this definitely shouldn't be your first choice.  It is well written and filled with loss, regret, masochism, and denial.  However, it is also filled with family, hope, and acceptance.  The balance between these concepts is what kept me reading and ultimately got me to pick up this book again and again.  I would highly recommend this book if you like a bit of mystery as well as complex characters all interwoven in the future glued together with science (science which is easily understandable and not too difficult to follow, btw).
B009AMANBA|5.0|THIS IS ABOUT THE BEST PRESIDENT WE HAVE EVER HAD. DANIEL DAY-LEWIS PORTRAYS LINCOLN WITH GREAT JUSTICE. HE FOUGHT FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT, TO STOP SLAVERY. THE MOVIE SEEMED TO HAVE IT'S TIME OF BEING DRAWN OUT SOME, BUT OVER ALL, THE MOVIE WAS SUPERB. THE DIALOG I FOUND GREAT.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining and interesting monster themed films I've ever seen. Even my husband liked it.
B00407PNY2|5.0|BEST MOVIE INVOLVING STEVE McQUEEN AND THE FORD MUSTANG IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIF. THE DRIVING SCENES IN THE MOVIE ARE OF THE BEST EVER MADE. WATCH IT AND TURN THE VOLUME UP IN THE RUNNING OF THE FORD MUSTANG.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|Though I love the Selleck version of this movie, this original movie is a great one. Marvin is always great and this movie is no exception. Focusing on the pasing of a way of life for many in the old West, you will see things from a different perspective. I was very glad to see this one come out in DVD as my old VHS tape is about worn out.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I ENJOYED THE MOVIE, BUT THAT WAS WHAT IT AMOUNTED TO. I AM AN OLD FASHION 007 FAN FROM THE PAST. I DID NOT FIND A GOLD FINGER 007 IN DANIEL CRAIG. LOTS OF ACTION, WELL PACKED AND EXCITING, BUT HE IS NOT A 007 CHARACTER IN MY BOOK.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Great movie! Not your typical Western, this piece shows there is no glory in killing. Eastwood does a great job of portraying a former outlaw, trying to live his life in a more peaceful manner. Accessories (guns, clothing, etc.) sticks to those of the period. Good support by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman. You'll find yourself continually asking - who is the good guy? When you realize there aren't any, you'll also understand this movie is more true to life than most Westerns.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|THEY DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE LIVE STAGE PLAY IN NEW YORK OR PHILLY THEATERS. THIS IS A MUST SEE.
B000CDO330|3.0|I think that I was expecting it to be bigger because the other animals I ordered were from Safari Ltd and were much bigger but it is still okay
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I love this season and love the cast in it! I can't stop watching it! I think it is my favorite season so far!

B005D63ICI|5.0|I can't stop watching it. I am enjoying every season and am getting more and more disappointed that the series is coming to an end at season 8.
034580404X|5.0|I thought the books were very entertaining. They arrived about 4 days after they were ordered. Great weekend read!  I already have 3 friends that are waiting to borrow them.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I get the impression that Grisham is going downhill. There is no depth to the story or to the characters.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Had no issues with the initial download - but can not get the dark forest portion to load! Very annoying
B004HD61KE|4.0|Being from Utah it is nice to actually read a book that shows intrigue happening there.  I like all James Rollins books, he writes a great mystery, a fun thriller and you feel like you learn things about all of his locations.  A great combination of things  and he never disappoints me.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I watched this movie on my I pad and it came through pretty well.I was happy with the video and it seemed there was no lag at all with my wireless connection.
B005K17RU0|5.0|If you need a weather app, this is the one for you.  It works best on a kindle fire or iPad,, but if you have a Google nexus, get it.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|While I really REALLY liked the movie and have watched it several times, my one complaint is the way they portrayed the Cornucopia.  I pictured it as it was described in the books.<br /><br />That being said the casting, the sets, the costumes went beyond my expectations.  One of the best movie adaptations I've seen.  I can't wait for Catching Fire.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Personal stories of  5 groups of people from different countries before and during WW1.  It makes history seem more personal and how the world was at the time.  You can relate today's events to those past historical events.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|My wife bought me this for my birthday.  I thought I knew quite a few of these recordings.  Not so.  I hadn't scratched the surface.  First, this is a veritable cross-section of the \\"Top 100\\" classical repertoire.  Second, Toscanini was clearly THE most important conductor of the first half of the 20th century and to have this astonishing legacy is to have a snapshot of what was going on in the listening of classical music \\"back then.\\"  A couple of things occur to me:  there was certainly a richness of public offerings via NBC radio broadcasts that just isn't there anymore.  It is one thing to have re-broadcasts of concerts from major orchestras as we have via public radio, today.  But many of these recordings were produced FOR broadcast; they were broadcast live, and they were not subject to edit or retake.  In my mind, that makes the artistic accomplishment of Toscanini and his orchestra even more amazing.<br /><br />Much whining has happened by self-styled critics since the beginning of the LP about the \\"dry\\" sound of Studio 8-H at NBC.  Broadcasting back then happened in virtually anechoic \\"booths\\" where broadcasters would do their thing.  Studio 8-H was just such a \\"booth\\" but was expanded to accommodate not just one announcer but an entire symphony orchestra -- but it was just barely big enough for THAT.  I've been in Studio 8-H; it's not a concert hall -- it's a broadcast booth.  The sound was intended to be \\"dry\\" because that was the legacy of the dawn of broadcasting.  Enough !!  Some of the MUSIC emanating from that infamous location is incredible.  The CD versions of Studio 8-H sound much better than the LP's did.  But, hey, the MUSIC is the thing.<br /><br />Some of these recordings were the ones my Dad owned in 78 form before I was born.  My pre-natal experience with Beethoven's 5th was the 1939 Toscanini recording.  The historical backdrop against which some of these recordings were made is humbling to think about.  That such richness and beauty could come out of such world turmoil is amazing.<br /><br />So I am thankful for this collection not because of how it \\"sounds\\" but because of what it IS -- the recorded legacy of one of the most historically significant musicians of all time recorded BEFORE the art of recording reached any kind of technical maturity.  I believe we need to quit complaining about what it isn't and treasure what it is -- one of the great recorded legacies of all time.  In the history of recorded sound this set is one of the \\"seven wonders of the world.\\"<br /><br />============<br /><br />Three months after acquiring this set it has occurred to me what a difference there is between the recorded output of Toscanini vs. Karajan.  In a German biography of the latter which I read in the 1960's it quoted him as saying that his aspiration as a conductor was to synthesize the strengths of Toscanini and Furtwaengler.  Whether he accomplished that or not is another debate, but the point is that Toscanini was on his radar as an ideal and a distant (if not direct) mentor.  But the diversity of the Karajan output is significantly broader than that of Toscanini.  I believe this says more about the state of the recording industry and of the target audiences than it does about the capabilities of the two maestri.  Nevertheless, the comparison is \\"interesting.\\"  Toscanini did not stray too far from basic repertoire whereas Karajan's legacy gave us a fuller representation of that repertoire and then went beyond into the works of composers not represented by Toscanini.  With Toscanini you get the Tchaikovsky Pathetique (only) -- while with Karajan you get all six symphonies, for example.  With T. you get almost no Bach; with K. you get the Brandenburgs and St. Matthew (if stylistically out of step with current scholarship).  Again, I think this has to do more with the expanding market for a broader repertoire.  When Toscanini was active the \\"market\\" -- beyond large population centers -- was just barely learning the basic repertoire.  Now, of course, the entire world has access to the entire gambit of classical music history.  Time marches on...ng the basic repertoire.  Now, of course, the entire world has access to the entire gambit of classical music history.  Time marches on...
B004JLDSIC|5.0|Stacey has this soft and smokey voice that blows me away, and add the great sax playing of Jim Tomlinson and you have a great combination. Ii have all of their recordings. Thank you.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I'm so glad Amazon decided to increase the bit-rate for the music and also include mp3 rips of the past CDs I purchased from Amazon.com.  Now I have more music to listen to anywhere I go when I travel.  Thanks Amazon!
B0094EDBM2|3.0|The case was broken so when  I open the plastic cover falls off.  Other than that, the cd s were as expected, new
B00AHXIC50|2.0|I was surprised by how much I liked his last album and bought this one without thinking about it.  I'm let down.  The songs just don't have the same amount of fun as the last album.  I'm glad I bought it on sale because it was not worth full price.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love watching and reading historical drama so this show is the most satisfying ever.  Can't wait for season four to be available!
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Overall nice toy, bright colors.. Good Quality but  I did not realize it was that small.  My niece loves it.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|This album is Awesome. Every song is great! I haven't stopped listening to it since I downloaded it.<br />If you're a Blake fan, you have to buy this one.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|From the write up on Amazon, it sounded like a good book.  While I got into the characters and all, they story was just too phone
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I edit all my pictures. Love it!!! I recommend it to everyone. Who loves playing. Around with pictures or edit them to make them look better
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My grandson had this and my husband wanted it.. Its fun I guess  he likes it -four more words oh
0393339815|5.0|A delight for P. J. Wodehouse fans.  Gift recipient very happy.  Prefer to no longer review since  there is a required number of words before computer will submit.
B006RBZV82|4.0|A wonderful use of hi-def. Beautiful photography, amazing, rarely-if-ever seen sea creatures.  Interesting for most any age level - and not too long.  Monstrous wolf eel and others may elicit squeals of delight and/or horror from younger children.  Kate Winslet's portion of the narration - or her script - was unexpectedly embarrassingly cringe-worthy, and the added-sound effects perhaps a little hoky, but an intereresting, enjoyable view that will help you appreciate the beauty of a good quality, hi-def big screen all the more.
006117758X|5.0|The story is so involving that i couldnt put the book down. I read over the weekend and drank alot of bourbon while i read, this made it very interesting. hank was a great writer
B000FA675C|5.0|This book had me looking for every chance I could get to read it.  I had seen the movie first and while I enjoy the movie, I loved the book even more so.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|this movie is like a crappy cartoon i cant belive its not anime. i will not be buying this again
B0018RC7QE|3.0|I was interested to see Robert DeNero and Meryl Streep in an older movie.... overall the movie was good but not one of my favorites
B0079R8KXG|3.0|It's okay, but kind of bulky and heavy.  The Kindle Fire is heavy enough without adding more weight to it.
0143118757|4.0|Tried a few of the techniques, I guess I need more practice.<br /><br />A lot of good ideas, but not always workable.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Because the item that I bought it doesn't work. They had to check the item before they sell, so we don't make disappointed especially electronics.
B005R2S3VE|3.0|I was hoping to catch a concert with Peter Cetera still in the group.  He's there, but the sound and picture quality are simply a recording of a TV show from overseas.  There were only seven songs.  It is what it is - I was just hoping for more.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love the slicers you can earn. I earnd so many things. I would play it all day if I had the time
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was looking for something new to read and Amazon recommended this on my Kindle phone app. I took a chance, and am I glad I did! It's hard to believe that the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars would be hilarious, but the author has a way with words that make even the struggle to survive funny. There's enough science in the story to keep it grounded and realistic, while the reactions to setbacks and successes on the part of the stranded astronaut make for extremely entertaining reading enjoyment. I recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor, and I can't wait for the movie to come out. Just don't get Justin Bieber to play the lead, OK?
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|Rented this to watch for girls nite. All of us, except for one, had seen it and were singing along with the movie. Love Meryl Streep! And Pierce Brosnan does a decent job for not being able to sing. They must have had a blast making this movie.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Awesome movie, or I wouldn't have bought it, but the price and value of this package was great! 3D disc is on two discs, and Bluray disc is separate. Special features is disc 4, and DVD is disc 5. Great value at $28!!! I will definitely preorder new releases in the future based on this experience.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a phenomenal end to the Hunger Games. With twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat the whole book. I never knew which way it was going to go till the very end. The ending was a perfect finale to the Hunger Games. I'd read them all over again. Well done.
