B00CKDYWYA|3.0|I loved Amy Tan's earlier books, which is why I ordered this one. It is completely different to her other works. I read it to the end, and i can't say I did not enjoy it. But the plot is complicated, the characters not that realistic, and in parts it's quite pornographic.

B00G4A6VZS|4.0|This app is awesome  when you first get it;  HOWEVER it does become tedious after a while. I like Stack the States a little more because in this app it won't let you put the countries entirely touching. This is very frustrating when you know a country will fit onto your pile but stupid rules with margins between the countries won't allow you to place it. Besides the one flaw; this app is great but the excitement of playing it wears off quickly.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I've rewritten this review four times because I can't decide if the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa. After careful consideration I have decided on the latter, and here's why:<br /><br />I'm not one to let an unexpected or &#34;bad&#34; ending stop me from enjoying a book, so that isn't the deciding factor for me. What really gets on my nerves about this book is that it leaves a lot of loose ends, and the poorly put together plot ruins the ingenuity of Divergent's  story line. The buildup to the big reveal of &#34;what's outside the fence&#34; was immense, and although I tried not to have any preconceptions, I expected a lot more than a bunch of wackos who believe that a person's character is defined by their genes alone. Not only is the &#34;genetically damaged vs. genetically pure&#34; stuff boring and lunatic, it's also a HUGE letdown. Tris and Tobias are first introduced as such brave and courageous yet vulnerable characters that I immediately became connected to them in Divergent, and that stuck while I read Insurgent. As cliché as it sounds, I swelled with pride at their accomplishments and found myself outraged when someone wronged them. To find out that all of their achievements in Dauntless, their defeat of Jeanine, their close calls with death, etc., are all just means of collecting data for some dumb experiment put on by the Bureau really makes me mad. I don't quite see why Ms. Roth would choose to finish the series in this way; it's almost as if she just wrote about the first thing she thought of, no matter that it's totally illogical. Not a good choice.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of the readers, I think giving Tobias his own voice in this book is one of the best aspects of this novel. Some readers argue that Four sounds too similar to Tris, but I think it's a plot issue (once again) rather than a character development problem. This story line didn't allow for Tobias to have any badass moments, so instead he sits around feeling sorry for himself. That's actually pretty realistic. The only aspect I didn't like about the double narration is that most of Tobias's thoughts end up being revealed in the Tris parts, which results in quite a bit of repetitiveness. However, I better understood how he processes relationships, both with his parents and with Tris.<br /><br />Okay so now for the ending. I cried, I got angry, I cried again. I thankfully did not throw my Kindle against a wall, but I can't say I wasn't close. Here's my problem with the ending. Tris deserved better. In a perfect world, she wouldn't have died, and she and Tobias could finally live happily ever after without fear of having to fit into a category, whether it be a faction or a genetic pool. Sadly, the Divergent world is anything but perfect, so I expected a main character to die. But not like Tris died. She deserved, AT LEAST, to have Tobias by her side during her last few moments, and she definitely deserved a more honorable death. I HATED that David shot her; like who even is he? What business does this guy, who's had maybe a paragraph or two of dialogue total, have shooting my favorite character of all time?! I would rather have seen her die at the hands of Jeanine or even Eric, someone who she's fought against multiple times. And to die in place of Caleb? No. Just no. Not satisfactory at all.<br />The chapters where Tobias remembers the things about her that he loves are sweet, they pretty much save the ending. However, I find it hard to believe that the Four I met in Divergent would sit around doing nothing instead of trying to avenge the death of the girl he loves.<br /><br />This book made me cry and therefore will forever have a spot in my heart. It didn't ruin the entire series for me, but I probably will not reread Allegiant, it's better to end with Insurgent.<br /><br />&#34;I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.&#34;<br /><br />I mean, at least it's a quotable book.

B005HSL626|5.0|This app will give you hours of fun. It is very entertaining; it runs smoothly on my kindle fire with no bugs yet! I like the three modes of gameplay for more fun. I also installed the second to most recent update which gives you starfruit and more blades/backgrounds for more fruit-slicing fun. There is also a store in which you use starfruit to buy power-ups to increase time and points.<br />I have had this app for a while...I have a high score of over 1000 on arcade mode and I won't be beating it soon making playing this pointless...but I play anyway as the fruit ninja fun never ends.<br />To sum up this app in one sentence...Hours of fun entertainment that's friendly to your bank account!<br />Would DEFENITELY recommend

B003XU02QG|1.0|This whole thing is terrible.  First of all this is based off an incident in history where a Germanic (not Celtic) tribe destroyed an entire legion.  Secondly depicting an invasive force who is stomping on an indigenous people as the &#34;good guys&#34; is also all kinds of messed up.  Further the &#34;queen of the Celts&#34; is so obviously the queen of Iceland (again nothing to do with Celts) it hurts.  Just a quick fact for you too.  Blue war paint or &#34;Woad&#34; is Germanic not Celtic.  In fact it is named after Wotan the Icelandic name for Odin.  This is one big steaming pile of Hollywood crap.

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Other reviews capture nicely why Rosie Project grabs and delights;  [even for those of us for whom  this seemed an unlikely candidate for subject and storyline]<br /><br />But, since I didn't see them in swooshing through the Amazon &#34;Customers who bought this book also bought:&#34; list,  if you liked or loved Rosie Project, were fascinated by the protagonists with a &#34;differently-abled point of view&#34;, try<br /><br />600 Hours of Edward  (and its sequel), by Craig Lancaster<br />and Lottery, by Patricia Wood<br /><br />These all also met my 5-star test for: against all odds (due to my initial skepticism about the subject matter):  Did it grab me and reel me in effortlessly? Did I put off other planned activities to keep reading longer? Did I read more by the same author (if available)? Do I still think about the book  months after finishing it?  Did I recommend it to others?

159463176X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't say quite &#34;what&#34; it is that Hosseini &#34;has&#34; as a writer, I just know that when I read this book, it immediately drew me in, I became attached to ALL of the characters and I think he writes beautifully. I could have read this book forever... and that would be my only criticism of the book. The book covers multiple generations of a family (or more than one family), and so there is only so much that Hosseini could include of each person's/family's story. Or the book would have gone on forever. And yet, especially for the later generations of the family (as well as the future updates of the initial main characters, like Abdallah and Pari), I wanted MORE. I really wanted more about Abdallah's &#34;middle life,&#34; as well as Pari's daughter's &#34;middle life.&#34; But, alas, a book can only be so long and still be sold as popular fiction. So I'll take what I can get from Hosseini. I liked this book as much as his others.

B00006879E|5.0|This is THE best album by Maroon 5.  There isn't a song on the album that I can't relate to in some way.  I feel the emotion behind the words while listening to Adam croon.  The only negative thing is that an album like this is almost impossible to top.  I don't think this album received the accolades that it deserved.  As a Maroon 5 fan I am craving another album like Songs About Jane.
0060557818|4.0|This is *completely* not my normal style of book. Apparently it's called an &#34;urban fantasy,&#34; and I have no idea what that even means. I have to admit that it took me a LONG time to get into the story, and I considered stopping reading the book at least ten times in the first half of it. It took me forever to start rolling with the style and the theme.<br /><br />But with that said... I am really glad I kept reading and by the end, I really enjoyed all of the main characters and I found the overall story quite enjoyable. Like many other reviewers have said, the story is rather like a grown-up version of Alice in Wonderland (I was thinking an adult version of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe). There are Velvets, Hunters, Early and Rat-speakers. Which, again, it really &#34;not my thing,&#34; but each group is really quite fascinating. Richard, the main character of the book, goes through a well-developed character development and plot. His main sidekick in the story, Door, I loved; just the right amount of strengths and weaknesses and character. There are two assassains, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, who are hilarious. And I really loved the marquis de Carabas, who is a bit of a bad guy and a good guy mixed. All of these characters live in &#34;London Below Ground,&#34; rather than what we consider reality, London Aboveground.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I'm not going to start reading other fantasy books after this one, but it was good departure from my normal reads and I really did love the characters. I'm sure I'll remember them more than the characters in most books that I read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A thrilling and inspiring story for my daughter. She was enthralled by the series. Very entertaining. The 4th and 5th graders I know who have read it handled the peril and mayhem. If your kids is aged 10 and up, I think they'll deal with the content alright. Your results may vary. :)
006202406X|3.0|I actually liked this book the most since it delved more into the science fiction aspects of the series. I feel like the character development held up well too, and I liked how the story in general played out. The story did make me feel deep emotions and I did enjoy many aspects of it, but certain plot developments are just downright disturbing, and to disturb a veteran reader like myself, you have to really try really hard. It is clear that the author tries her hardest to disturb her readers with this book and leave people feeling downtrodden upon completion of the series. I will cut her some slack however, since she is only 25 years old, and hashed out the ideas for this series in college.  I know if you have already read the 2nd novel, you will most likely read Allegiant. I will not discourage this, but I would say you should brace yourself to imagine alternative endings or read fan fiction.  The ending of this book is beautiful, but it was very disappointing at the same time.  If you have only read the first novel, Divergent, I would encourage you to stop reading the series now before the 2nd and 3rd books ruin it for you.<br /><br />Intentionally vague, non character specific spoilers ahead:<br />I am however, incredibly disappointed and saddened by the author's ruthless treatment of characters who you learn about and becoming attached to during the series. She could have done without some of the death. There is so much death in this series, some of it senseless, that it becomes cliche and worn out.<br /><br />I don't think the author cares about delivering what fans want. I have never heard of any trilogy ending this way, and honestly cannot see this playing out in a movie. Why would anyone want to see characters they become attached to the whole series snuffed out during the last book/film?  It is beyond comprehension.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The story of a young girl's innocence and the power of the written word during the holocaust are familiar themes. Markus Zusak's voice, however, is not. I found his ability to show as much as tell the language extremely well done. In the most horrific of situations, he manages to bring faith, joy and humanity -- through the voice of death. I highly recommend this book.
0062255657|3.0|I think this is less a novel than an &#34;extended short story.&#34; I think the author has a great imagination, especially when it comes to the story's &#34;monsters,&#34; as well as his main characters (I loved Lettie Hempstock and the whole Hempstock family). The writing can also be quite poetic. But I can't say I loved the book, or will necessarily remember it long after reading some new books. I do think smart teenagers would love the story. And it is quite fast.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've watched all the seasons.  The English have such a terrific way mixing drama with subtle humor.  The scenery is beautiful and the characters so well acted.  Some characters you start out liking and then start to dislike, others it's the opposite.  A great story.

1476727910|4.0|I really liked this book.  I liked the story, the realism of the characters, the beliefs and much of the “politics” contained within it.  The essential story is about humanity, and what makes us humans (unique a humans).  The book does this without being too preachy (yes, it is preachy at times), and through a good story.  After the book finishes, the author mentions that he got the idea for this book while beset by constant panic attacks… which makes a lot of sense, as really, we all learn our best lessons when in difficulty.  I can honestly say that there are about 30+ quotes I could take from this book, wanting to paste them up all around me as reminders.  Facebook friends, so sorry you will be seeing some of them posted as “status” updates.  As someone who suffers from chronic pain (daily migraines), many of these ideas/quotes were/are much needed.<br /><br />What I do find “funny” is that, perhaps, the one thing I disagree with the author the most on is religion.  He does seem to argue against it throughout his story, while I am quite religious.  And the reasons he doesn’t believe in religion tend to be the *exact* reasons I DO believe in religion.  I would argue this is because he is European, and despite the fact that I was born a “westerner,” I am a Muslim convert and therefore I now see the world through a “Muslim lens.”  Meaning I see absolutely no contradiction between religion and science, but rather that the two are the same thing and supportive of one another (despite the prejudices raised by ignorant, non-religiously knowledgeable so-called Muslims in the world like the Taliban, arguing for a return to the Dark Ages).  The book is FULL of incredibly interesting science, while at the same time full of moral beliefs and views of the value of the human life.  The author tends to argue that human life is valuable specifically because it is limited, and it ends when life ends.  That human life is valuable because it is finite, and therefore every moment is valuable.  But he also argues that it is pain, and heartache, and mistakes, etc., etc. that teach us the wisdom of life.  Myself, as a Muslim (borrowing the ideas of the Muslim author Jeffrey Lang here in his book “Even Angels Ask”, giving him appropriate credit if I understand his writings correctly), I believe the whole “purpose” of life of to form a relationship with God.  And how does one do so?  He/she does so through learning God’s attributes (i.e. Just, Merciful, Forgiving, Provider, Preserver, Giving, Watchful, Responsive, Wise, Loving, Truthful, Strong, Protecting, Kind, Compassionate, Defender, Unifier, Patient and more) and forming a relationship with God.  And how can someone have a relationship with God (or anyone/anything for that matter) or know Him/Her?  It is through knowing that “person” (you cannot have a real relationship with someone, a deep one, without an honest knowing of each other).  And I believe, essentially, that this is rather the message in this book.  It is the fact that humans are given free will (which the author mentions is untrue in this book, yet the whole message is about humans making choices and learning from those choices) that makes us valuable.  In the Qur’an, there is the story of the angels questioning God when he creates humanity (even though, but their very nature, angels are created simply to carry out God’s will, and therefore they cannot question God), asking how he could create such a violent race.  And God says that, yes, while humans have the propensity for violence, they also have the propensity for love and kindness (think Hitler versus Mother Theresa).  And that those without free will (the angels), while brilliant, have not the ability to be kind, loving, giving, etc.  It is our ability to CHOOSE between the two that makes us human.  And the author, while never discussing religion in the book (although often mentioning it as a “myth”), seems to make this the exactmessage of the book as well.<br /><br />In any case, I loved the book.  I felt it spoke to many universal truths while also telling a really great story.  To the author, if he’s reading this... you just might find the book “Even Angels Ask” by Jeffrey Land worth your time.  He is a math professor, and therefore would have much in common with your character Andrew Martin.  Thanks for the great read.<br /><br />I might add that another large point of the book is that technological advances do not advance the human condition, but instead tend to promote humanity’s worst traits.  And I can say that I can understand this thinking (especially when I think on the fact that today’s existing hunters and gatherers, when compared to “modern” societies, have been shown to be happier and have greater amounts of free time and family time, as well as being appropriately provided for in their needs).  But I also think it is not necessarily true (think of the times when Muslims created the basics of math and science, such as algebra and geometry and the basics of medicine; as well as when Muslims ruled Spain and created, perhaps, the most just, educated and religiously tolerant society of all time). My point on the book… largely being that I appreciate the book’s ability to constantly make me think.message of the book as well.<br /><br />In any case, I loved the book.

B009BDVD2Q|4.0|Stephen King, On Writing/Secret Windows (Scribner's,<br />2000 and BOMC, 2000)<br />[originally posted 6Nov2000]<br /><br />&#34;Most of the things you find in books on writing are bull[censored for Amazon consumption].&#34; How can you not like a book on writing that begins so endearingly? Shortly after, King makes a promise to keep the book as short as possible, and for King, he does an admirable job (it weighs in under 300 pages, a short story for this guy). Capitalizing on the publication of On Writing, Book of the Month Club (who are the behind-the-scenes orchestrators of the Stephen King Book Club) contracted with the man to release a companion volume to it called Secret Windows as well.<br /><br />Much of what King writes in On Writing is simple common sense (&#34;the adverb is not your friend...&#34;), but some of it flies in the face of conventional wisdom. King is a situational writer as opposed to a plotter, and the vast majority of &#34;how to write your novel in &#60;x&#62; days&#34;-style writers' manuals are written by plotters. This alone makes the book valuable to the struggling author; when everyone's told you one thing, and it doesn't work for you, hearing someone validate another way to do things is sometimes the most important thing that can happen to you. And King delivers his advice in simple, straightforward prose, providing examples when necessary (at the very end, he gives us the opening paragraphs of Blood and Smoke's &#34;1408,&#34; both in rough and finished drafts, and it's probably the best example of revision I've seen in a how-to-write book). Good, solid stuff, probably the best I've read in recent years, since Natalie Goldberg's first two books.<br /><br />But even that isn't what makes this book shine. We're all aware that much of what separates great writers from run-of-the-mill hacks is the ability to take one's own events and make mincemeat of them on the page. The first hundred pages of this volume are an encapsulated autobiography of King. It's impressionist, deadpan, as minimal as it can be to give us an idea of where all these books came from (no, he doesn't really get his ideas in Utica). And while all of King's writing is marked with a particular kind of honesty that resonates with the average reader, these hundred pages stand out. If it's possible to be more than completely honest, he's done it.<br /><br />Secret Windows is a compilation. Most of it's been previously published. There are a few things here that bear re-reading, a few unpublished (and perhaps should have remained that way, such as the early stuff from his brother's homemade newspaper), and one of King's early attempts at a one-voice tale, a style he mastered in Dolores Claiborne, called &#34;The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet.&#34; I can't remember whether this made it into Nightmares and Dreamscapes or not (can't find a full listing of N&D's contents online) [ed. note 2013: no], but if not, this story alone, about an editor's slow descent into alcoholic madness, with its catalyst a story by an already-insane writer, is worth the price of admission. It is not an easily-forgotten piece of work.<br /><br />Taken together, the two make a good pair: a book on how to write and a collection of fiction, nonfiction, and interviews dealing with the craft of writing. The average non-writing Stephen King fan may be left cold, but for the writer (or the writer wannabe who's never attempted; if you liked Misery better than most King novels, you qualify), they're gold nuggets in the river.<br /><br />On Writing: ****<br />Secret Windows: *** ½aphy of King.

0061950726|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Although it's fiction, the author did write the story after doing a lot of research on the TRUE story of orphan trains making their way to the Midwest from the East Coast for 75 years (1850s to 1930s), bring homeless or orphan kids to families willing to take them in. This story is about Molly, a present-day teenage girl is foster care, who forms a relationship with Vivian, a woman in her 90s, brought to MN on an orphan train in the 1920s and raised by various foster families. I adored BOTH main characters (strong, independent women) and really enjoyed both stories. Orphan trains are not something I knew about US history before this book, so the history is fascinating, and the stories are good as well. Entertaining, pretty fast read, well-written and paced. Highly recommend.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. These are my favorite types of games. The puzzles are complex yet not so tough that I can't eventually get them. The greater challenge is getting them in the least possible moves. That gives me yet another thing to strive for. Oh and then add finding the hidden jewel, well what can I say this is a fun game. I now have my husband hooked on it. I will be looking for more games from this group.  Very well thought out and put together.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|When it comes to time killing games I love card games like FreeCell. They are great for a short game and they make you think and have fun at the same time. This game isn't to bad and I enjoy playing it. The cards are a bit small but I change the card styles to find the best ones that suit me.<br /><br />I used this on my Kindle Fire and liked it. I have larger screen tablets and they are better to play cards on because everything is just larger but I still gave this game 5 stars for enjoyment and for being a fun time killer.<br /><br />It is worth getting as the free app of the day.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the most interesting reads I've had in years.  The characters are so well developed that it’s hard not to fall hard for the characters.  The TV series does the story well.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|&#34;Man of Steel&#34; leaps on to Blu-ray and DVD and the question on everyone's mind is, &#34;How does it hold up in a home entertainment setting?&#34; I'm happy to say it fares well and doesn't lose any of its charm or excitement. I've watched it both on a 32-inch and 45-inch TV and it held up as an emotional and action-packed rollercoaster ride filled with enough well-crafted eye-candy to stun even the most cynical CGI naysayer.<br /><br />Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) has known since his early childhood that he's endowed with super powers and an orphan from another planet. As he grows into manhood, he begins to drift from one job to another on his journey to discover who he is and why he's here. When the Earth is threatened by an extraterrestrial invader, Clark must embrace his destiny to save mankind from certain doom.<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder and writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan successfully update the mythology of Superman while hanging on to the classic aspects of the character that have kept him in our hearts and minds for 75 years. We might see the &#34;New 52&#34; version of the super hero visually, but he's still the same old great American Man of Steel creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster brought to the printed page in 1936. Sure, the enemies are equipped with more technology and deadlier weapons than the two-bit gangsters he went up against in the days of World War II, but he still stands for truth and justice.<br /><br />As a personal note, I would like to comment on the way Superman identifies himself to the military as being as American as he can be in &#34;Man of Steel.&#34; After all, he did grow up in Kansas he states. I can't help but feel this line in the film was added by Goyer to make amends for his ridiculously PC contribution to Action Comics #900. He had the hero renounce his citizenship as an American and state he was now a citizen of the world in it.<br /><br />The high-definition audio and video transfer for &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is pristine. The 7.1 surround sound drops the viewer right into the center of all the action and successfully transports you to the faraway world of Krypton. The picture is vivid and clear, showing off the incredible mind-blowing special effects. It's amazing how real everything looks in the CGI-heavy battle scenes.<br /><br />Besides some bad language and violence, &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is perfect for the whole family. It is a darker take on Superman than we've seen in the past. The moral messages of standing up for what is right and striving to be good in the face of great evil is still found.<br /><br />There are many references to Christianity made as well. Our hero begins his life of crime-fighting in the public eye at 33 years old, which is the time Jesus is said to have embarked on his ministry. Another example is how he spreads out his arms like Christ on the cross just as he sweeps down to save Lois Lane and the entire world from Zod and his forces.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of &#34;Man of Steel&#34; includes a few special features. &#34;Journey of Discovery: Creating 'Man of Steel'&#34; is over two and a half hours of supplemental material, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and interviews you can take in while watching the film. It also includes four other featurettes that explore the making of the film and delve into the characters and Krypton. There's also a six minute featurette entitled &#34;New Zealand: Home to Middle Earth.&#34; Apparently, Warner Bros. feels it's necessary to constantly remind us that &#34;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&#34; is coming out soon.<br /><br />&#34;Man of Steel&#34; is a pleasing addition to any comic book movie enthusiast's home entertainment library. Consumers will find it to be a worthy purchase because of a great feature film and plenty of bonus material to be excited about. While not as epic as &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; trilogy, it will definitely stand as a fine example of super hero movies foryears to come.years to come.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel Washington always delivers, I just thought it wasn't as exciting as I expected it to be. I would recommend it as it is a good movie anyway.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|I bought this album when it was on special for $0.99 and it was one of the best things I have bought for a dollar. In fact it was my first purchase on Amazon and I was very satisfied with the content. This album is different from Demi's previous work, it is more mature but quality of the music is just as great and even more meaningful than before.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is such a great read. It is interesting, well written, and keeps you guessing from the very beginning. I've read it more than once and still enjoy it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I found this game from an advertisement,on my Kindle.  It was free so I thought, what the neck.  I can always delete it.  That was two days ago and I have not stopped.  There is always something to do, unless your making jewelry or searching hidden areas - which is probably good since I wouldn't say otherwise.  I have lost sleep playing this game.<br />It makes you think and strategize, which is necessary, to earn money faster and not lose your crows.<br />  I'm only on level 16 and only connected to Facebook once, to earn crowns.  I don't use Facebook - I created an account simple to enter a contest last year (did not win and have no desire to use the account, except when I get prompted to logon to earn points in a game), so it was disappointing to read that it would be required at some point, at which time I will stop playing and remove it.  I don't t think it should be necessary to connect to social media to play anything.  It may have started there, but it's moved beyond that and should have been adapted to the device they created for.<br />It does take a ridiculous amount of time to make jewelry and grow blueberries, compared to other things, which is frustrating, but it is still an enjoyable game.  Very well made and I have not experienced any problems yet.<br />If you g st it and are a first time player like me, don't waste your crowns.  They are hard to earn, unless you don't mind spending real money, which I do or I wouldn't be playing free games.  I agree with other comments, it is way to easy to use crowns by mistake, butt then so is deciding what to do with your supplies.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved it on my Ipod. But now on my kindle. Pure Awesome fun. Kids would love it and play it forever.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I really like this game and have had it ever since it came out. It's cool and all but the updates take forever to come out. If you could try to make updates faster that would be great
B00C74SHRK|1.0|Donna Tartt is a new author for me and I'm afraid I was lured into buying the book for all the wrong reasons! The number of pages! Not a good reason for purchasing a book. I'd heard it reviewed by a respected reviewer but I'm afraid I simply could not finish it. I persevered for 3 weeks through long winded, convoluted pages of a tragic and desperate 13 year old hero whose life disintegrates  after the death of his mother into something almost unbelievable. I abandoned it this afternoon - something I do very infrequently.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have had more fun playing this game than many of the other running games out there. It keeps it interesting and fairly difficult at the same time. I am not the best player there is, but I recommend this game to anyone young or ancient.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very fun game with no bugs that I have found. Kills time really well, plus I can't wait to take my break at work to play it!

0312641893|5.0|Purchased for myself and loved the series can't wait for the next one. I have donated this book to the middle school for the kids because I know they will love it.
B00BAXFCPO|3.0|Lots if valuable information, but not great reading.  It is written like a text book.  If you looking for information about carbs and their effects on the brain, this is a good book do read.
B00GX598FO|1.0|it was horrible… slow, marylouise parker couldn't act worth a darn. there was no chemistry between bruce and MLP.  DOnt waste your money.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is a really scary movie, with the best sound track of Christmas music I ever heard.  It's pushing out other versions to become my current favorite.  It's funny, too, and attention holding.  It's hard to stay quiet while watching this because I want to shout and cheer and scream and gasp.  The color and animation are brilliant.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I loved it!  Sometimes I'm in the mood for a light-hearted book that will make me happy.  This book fit the bill perfectly.  It's so charming, so funny, so romantic, so sweet, and there's even a bit of intrigue and suspense thrown in.  Most importantly, the happy ending is never in doubt.  The plot revolves around a cell phone that two strangers end up sharing.  They get to know each other through their text messages and emails.  It's a clever idea, very well executed by the author.  This is the first book I've read by Sophia Kinsella.  I'm so glad I've found another author I can turn to when I need a &#34;feel good&#34; read.<br /><br />The footnotes throughout the book are very funny.  Don't let the footnotes scare you off from reading it on a Kindle.  There's a note at the beginning of the book that tells you how to read them on a Kindle.  You touch the footnote number to jump to the footnote text, then touch the number again to return to the text.  It's not hard.  I got tired of doing it as I was reading and just read them all at the end of each chapter.  It's no big deal if you don't read them as they appear.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I tried downloading this app and it won't work. My web browser won't even work :( I really don't like it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Short levels, great for just killing a few minutes here and there. Can be quite challenging. Ads aren't really that annoying with this free game.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Best. Season. Finale. Ever.<br /><br />Seriously, this blew me out of the water. Matt Smith is amazing. Boggle at the fact that a 26-year-old could pull of age and weariness so beautifully. Be amazed, and watch it all over again.<br /><br />Kinda skimps on the extras, though. Sad.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was wonderful, made me laugh, cry and remember times in my own life. War causes terrible losses on both sides and the deaths of the young and innocent.  To look at the lives, deaths and struggles of those affected by WWII was eye opening. We must never forget WE are all same.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|great replacement!!  my kindle works great still!!!<br />Ihave a kindle...this was a solution to a hick up my kindle was experiencing
B008Y7J91M|4.0|Fairly true to the book.  I thought it was well acted, and even my husband CHOSE to watch it even though he usually prefers not to watch &#34; movies like that&#34;
B002ZHKZEM|3.0|The specials themselves: Terrible<br />The DVD extras: Pretty good<br /><br />Showrunner Russell T Davies is great at beginnings, not so much at endings. It really shows here. Don't get me wrong: if it weren't for Davies, the show would not have come back, and I would never have discovered it, and many wonderful times would not be had. Ten will always be my Doctor.<br /><br />But when &#34;your&#34; Doctor regenerates, you shouldn't be feeling the urge to yell &#34;DIE ALREADY!&#34;<br /><br />That said, the extras are good. There's a lot of good content. The part where Tennant films his last scenes is a bit heartbreaking. And the preface to the booklet is quite possibly the most adorable thing ever written.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|IT IS A MUST BUY! Never before seen footage! Hours of entertainment! See the love story from the beginning to forever. Must have...
B005AKFXZW|5.0|This is an imaginative and wonderful read.  Perfect for removing you from the stress or tedium of everyday life.  A magical story with an ending which works beautifully.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Keeps ur interest, u don't kno who to trust or who is what, Greek or Roman, new territory from both sides, and a whole new side. Confused? U'll enjoy it and want more. So Riordan, get with it. We r waiting. Take some time for movies, but not too much. Thanks. Happy Holidays!!!
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|I had never heard of Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi, Jack White, or any of the many Italian collaborators on this one-of-a-kind musical project.  It was quite by accident that I stumbled onto this disc, after doing a Norah Jones search on Amazon.  (She does three vocals on the disc.)  I read the info about the CD, including some reviews.  I was intrigued, as I love Ennio Morricone and his orchestrations--especially on the &#34;Spaghetti westerns,&#34; and I read about how he was the inspiration for this five-year project.  I listened to some sample tracks and decided to go for it.  I have to say, the first play-through at home didn't impress me...probably because, like a good cup of espresso or a fine wine, your tastes must adapt a bit.  But after playing it a second time, I found myself putting it on repeat and listening for hours...something I rarely do!  It is a beautifully-interwoven sonic tapestry, with hauntingly-lush and somewhat psychedelic instrumentals and some just plain great songs.  It begins with &#34;Theme From Rome,&#34; setting the stage for the cinematic sound that &#34;glues&#34; the tracks together into a cohesive whole.  Of the 15 tracks, nine are largely instrumental, some with choral backup.  The six vocals are a wonderful blend of classic British rock and pop, while never losing the Italian soundtrack &#34;thread&#34; that runs through the whole disc.  Norah Jones' voice is well-suited to the total concept, and I found myself making comparisons to Dido on her three tracks.  As noted by others, there is a distinctly &#34;Hotel California&#34; influence on tracks 9, 10, and 15....particularly on the guitar work in &#34;Black,&#34; a Norah Jones track.  The synth work on track 11 is reminiscent of the Animals, and tracks 2, 7, and 15 are all &#34;Beatle-esque&#34; in terms of arrangements, harmonies, and drums.  In fact, I could view &#34;Rose With a Broken Neck&#34; and &#34;Two Against One&#34; as &#34;John Lennon tunes, as sung by Supertramp.&#34;  &#34;The World,&#34; track 15, has a similar flavor, but I would call it something more like &#34;George Harrison, as sung by Supertramp.&#34;  Stylistic influences (or happy accidents) aside, the concept and execution are flawless, with stunning sound recorded on vintage equipment.  This is a rare musical gem.  Buy it before it goes the way of David Gilmour's &#34;On an Island&#34;....a forgotten treasure you wish you had bought sooner.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works Great! Very simplistic, but also very useful! There is a limited number of supported apps for now, but that list will only grow.<br /><br />Would love to see Plex as a Chromecast-supported app.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|Love it! Love how it comes looking like a book! A little hard to get the discs out but if you download the digital copy's you only need to take out the extras discs.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Great graphics and game play, but it has been designed so you can't really upgrade armour without spending real money in game. Giving it a 4/5 but would be 5/5 if it was possible to upgrade without spending hundreds of dollars.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was mesmorized by this book! I had heard a very small amount of information about the orphans during this time frame but it was really interesting to read this story (even if put together from various accounts). The alternating present to past style was a great way to put the 2 stories together. I appreciated the historical photos & documentation as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the cussing (although I know it's common with many teens!) and the physical scenes with the teenager in the book. I know I'm a bit conservative but now I have to hold off on letting my middle schooler read this book.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|action, adventure, funny, very good! has you on the edge of your seat, and clearing for the good guys, a must see!

B00BD99JMW|5.0|It really is a great book, I swear. The ending is just so sad, though. It is not how I wanted it to end at all.
B008JFUPZI|4.0|funny, enjoyable,the storyline was good, but wish there was some more, seems like there could of been more to it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an absolutely adorable book.  Auggie, the main character is someone who will stay in your mind and heart long after the last page.  It is thoughtfully written and the characters all ring true and come to life on the pages. I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.  Grandson loves it.  He downloaded it last week and played for several hours.  I tried it too and like it.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror. This isn't really a zombie movie.. More of a big budget action, Brad Pitt fest. Not bad.. Some interesting scenes and ideas but feels rushed and doesn't fully develop any of them like the book does. Pretty tame as we'll.. Almost a complete lack of blood, gore, cursing, sex or nudity. I wouldn't have felt like too horrible a parent had our 10 year old watched it with us.<br /><br />Decent popcorn flick, but forgot most of the movie 10 minutes after it was over.. Meh.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|An intriguing tale of a young boy and his journey into manhood. A revelation of man's tendencies to driven by greed.<br />A portrait of the changing nature of man to react both positively and negatively depending on the circumstances. All in all a great adventure told in such a way that stimulates a feeling of hope for young people and that evil truly exists in our world.
B00F5HWC7W|4.0|In this day and age of cherry-picking songs off of iTunes, listening for free off of You Tube, and self-made playlists, there seems to be little need for an officially-released compilation album. However, I am very pleased that The Killers have gone the traditional route and compiled all their best songs into a single new release.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers, I already have all The Killers' albums, so the only new material I'm getting is tracks 14 - 17. And yet I don't consider my money wasted, because I do think it's important to support your favorite artists financially. Not only is it just the right thing to do, but it enables them to continue making great music. Secondly, listening to this whole disc all the way through serves as a reminder of what a great band The Killers really are. Certainly one of the best bands of the new century.<br /><br />The \\"Mr. Brightside\\" demo and the \\"When You Were Young\\" remix are really the only tracks I don't care for. As one reviewer stated already, the \\"Mr. Brightside\\" demo is only mildly different from the album version, and the \\"When You Were Young\\" remix, like many remixes, is superfluous.<br /><br />The new song \\"Shot At The Night\\" is fantastic, more proof that The Killers almost can't make a bad song.<br /><br />All in all, whether you've been a dedicated fan since their first album, or if you're just getting into The Killers, I would say this album is worth your money.
B0000640VO|4.0|Classical French Movie with Light, Sweet Humor. I bought this for my sister before she came to visit in France and she enjoyed it.
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|Ariana's voice is truly amazing. She just has pure talent, plain and simple, and overall I'm really into her.<br />The only reason her cd gets 4 stars and not 5 is because, well, the actual songs could have been A LOT better.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are a good number of GREAT songs on here; probably about half. However the other half, although her voice still shines, are just not songs that I feel like anyone would like. It's kind of like a genre of music that absolutely NO ONE is into. Here's how I rated the songs:<br /><br />*Honeymoon Avenue - one of my favorites. Love this one! 5/5<br />Baby I - this song had to grow on me, but overall I like it. Her voice shines. But it's definitely one of those songs that won't appeal to many people. 4/5<br />Right There - could have been a lot better. I like the Big Sean feature, and I do like the song overall...it's just kind of slow and the beat is a little boring. 3.5/5<br />Tattooed Heart - definitely a highlight of the album. Her voice is just phenomenal here. But again - it sounds very 60's, and even though I like it, I'm not sure a lot of other people would feel the same. 4.5/5<br />Lovin' It - I skip this song a lot. The chorus is catchy, but idk, I'm just not really into this one. 3.5/5<br />Piano - mixed feelings on this song. It can sound really corny at times, but really great at others. 3.5/5<br />Daydreamin' - feel the same way about this song as I do the previous song. 3.5/5<br />The Way - loved this song from when it first came out! Definitely the right choice to release as her single. 5/5<br />You'll Never Know - this song is very &#34;Mariah&#34;...as in it has great vocals, but the song itself is kind of crappy =( 3/5<br />*Almost Is Never Enough - this song & Honeymoon Ave are definitely my favorites! Flawless song; voice songs amazing over the piano. 5/5<br />Popular Song - another song that leaves me with mixed feelings. It's catchy and kinda cute I guess but really just corny overall. 3.5/5<br />Better Left Unsaid - after listening to this one a few times, I always skip it now! It's really sad, this could have been a GREAT song...the lyrics are so on point, and her voice (as always) sounds phenom. But the &#34;if you wanna party&#34; part of the song completely ruins everything. It doesn't fit and doesn't even sound good at all =( 3/5Better Left Unsaid - after listening to this one a few times, I always skip it now!

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Some of the one-star ratings here are complaining about the price point for this set, which is absolutely fine.  If the cost of this set is too much for you, then by all means collect the individual seasons instead.  HOWEVER, you should be warned; there is a significant amount of supplemental material you'll be missing out on.  An exclusive disc contains a 2+ hour documentary on the creation and execution of the final eight episodes, as well as aggregating the retail exclusives that were available on the various individual season releases.  This is an entire Blu-Ray's worth of material unavailable anywhere else.<br /><br />As for the rest of it, here's Vince Gilligan himself breaking it all down: [...]

B002KYHZLQ|2.0|I have heard great things about Erikson and this series, but I just couldn't get into it. There is so much going on in this book that I never really figured out what was happening, or why I should care about any of the characters or the plot. It has so much jargon that I had to go back over passages to figure out what the author was trying to say. I know others have loved this series, but I was defeated by its complexity and incoherence. I only got half-way through the book before putting it down for good.

Why the heck should I have to submit my credit card details when I'm already logged into my Amazon account. All my payment details are already saved on my account, aren't they?
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|This is a decent, honest, worthwhile game with thoughtful artwork and music made user friendly by the map and hint system. It moves well and feels satisfying. Will developers ever create a game wherein everything is not decrepit and in crumbling ruin? I don't get the appeal. When boredom strikes I'll go back and play through for the alternate ending. I would recommend this for the PG's and up. Enjoy.

B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love this app because it's perfectly in sync with my web account. Have it on both my Windows Phone 8 and Android tablet. Works great on both devices. I prefer the app to the mobile website.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book came to me at an improbably perfect time.  Life feels like it's spinning out control, but through Cheryl's story I remembered that every day might not be special, but there is something special in every day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it and will read again! I bought it for my kindle, but wouldn't mind getting a paper version also.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book, love the way the book follows up on little Danny from the Shining. Of course he would have some demons to fight after his time at the Overlook hotel and this is the story of those demons and how he overcomes them.  Always love Stephen King, so entertaining.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Really great idea but needs more ap support from Google!  Basically just netflix and youtube at this point.  Would like to see cable company apps from DirectTV or Comcast etc...
B003WQT2YY|5.0|It is one of the classic &#34;fiction&#34; movies about Mozart. It's wonderful interpretation of his life, music and career. I think it is one of a kind and every music lover would enjoy seeing it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best out of the three books! Love it and will read again! I bought it for my kindle, but wouldn't mind getting a paper version also.
B009CVRQLY|1.0|I did not like this CD at all!  This is the first CD of Celine's I have been unhappy with, since she began putting out music.  What happened to Celine?  I'm an avid Fan.  I've seen Celine twice in person in Vegas, She has always been better than anyone in person.  I'm very sad about this recording!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best app I have ever played.<br />It is so addictive,I have already unlock most of the maps and vehicles.<br />My favorite vehicle is the tank get the tank.<br />The tank of upgraded allot will get u berry far.<br />GET THE MAP MOON YOU WILL HAVE VERRY LITTLE GRAVITY SO YOU GET INSANE AIR TIME LIKE 10,000 COINS IN 1JUMP.<br />On the map moon I get at least 75,000 COINS in 1 match.<br />I recommend this to anyone and ps the map forest and volcano are cool.
B0001I562I|5.0|A great movie for its time. It has suspense, humor and a great plot. Sci-fy for sure, and dated, but it's still a great plot.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is good out of the three books! Love it and will read again! I bought it for my kindle, but wouldn't mind getting a paper version also.

B0058DRSHW|4.0|It is a good book to know about the basic principles every long lasting company practices. It gave me framework on which I should build my company.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|Well I did read some reviews that said they thought it was not an authentic set but wanted to try it anyway.  Well I got to see first hand that they are just bad burned copies.  Disc 3 said it was Harry Potter prisoner of Azkaban but when it is in the DVD player the movie that plays is &#34;THE POLAR EXPRESS&#34;.  I am a big fan of Amazon but this made me a little leery of future DVD purchases with them.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|if this is the real car experience I cant wait for my liscence it is awesome game car racing rocks./
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Do you like fighting games? Do you like the DC comic universe? You'll love this app! Plus if you have the console version, you can gain unlocks through this app.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Despitee all of the hype, this is absolutly their best album. Very diverse range of Daft Punk. Not just dance music, but you can dance to it. Sort of a music through the ages homage to thier influences.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I think it is a really good game to play you are in a relaxing mood but not better than candy crush
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This games graphics is vary good and its a great game to pass the time. I highly recommend getting this game.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a great movie, I had not heard anything about it before watching it. I am not sure how it compares to the books, that being said it is a good movie on its own.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is very fun.It's hours of fun and the only thing that bothers me is the ads....so plz get rid of the ads and make more apps like this
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Amazing, uplifting, wonderful, never get sick of listening or viewing. Such high quality production values, I am buying them all.
0670451495|5.0|A book my children loved,,,now will be a gift for my daughter who will read it to her son!!!! It's exactly the way I remembered it and she is going to love it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game good graphics and smart options! A must play for all hunters.<br />Very realistic and challenging.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was amazing!!! Very interesting read. Really got emotionally invested. I want to more about what happened to the characters :(
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Had the very same problem other players described.  Upgraded and then I only had 1/2 a screen visible.  Had to start all over again.  Please fix the glitch.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Absolutely fascinating history of cooking.  When my book club chose this book, I wasn't sure I would read it.  I'm so glad I did because it has changed my view of cooking.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a wonderful book although the dialogue between the characters do not sound like teenagers. I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody! (:
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a little bit difficult to get used to the controls with the touch screen but once you get the hang of it it can create hours of entertainment. And who doesn't love the cute minions?
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game very challenging . Enjoyed many hours of mystery object fun. I wish the were more games like this one.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the book that got they whole thing ( and me) started! Everyone has such a great characters! Especially Persassy  Jackson ( pun-most-certainly-intended)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Auggie and the other kids were so true to the situation of a child who is different in some way and the response of  those around him/her.  This book is for everyone, not just middle-schoolers.  The different voices in the book enriched its message by giving varied points-of-view.  I will recommend this book to all my adult friends as well as to my grandchildren and their friends.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie. The story grabs you from the beginning. All of the characters are memorable and you can picture them perfectly.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|Sheds some insight into the process of addiction.  And so sad.  Makes you wonder what's behind your every compulsion.  That darn childhood.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I liked the first two better. It took a little longer to get through this one but it was still good.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I liked the first season so well, I ordered the complete series - less season 8 that was still running.
B0025TOH5S|5.0|FUN MOVIE!  One of my favorite Goldie Hawn movies ever!  If you have not seen this, it's a must-see!!!  Too funny!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My wife loves this game and is addicted to it. She got candy crush fever and has been waiting for it on my kindle.
B00G4EXNNM|2.0|These covers do nothing to enhance the originals.  Buy an Everlies box set and listen to the real thing, this isn't even close.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Love the atmosphere and music...no glitches for me so far.  I feel drawn into some kind of mysterious undertaking...At one pole I have City of Fools at the other pole this game.  Entertaining.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple and challenging.  Level of complexities just right for me.  Almost hate to<br />finish a level because I know there are a limited number.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this game, it is fun and I love it so much. They should make one like this of ginger
B001974DG0|5.0|There is good reason many folks consider this their favorite Koontz novel... No spoilers here - no need... Just pick up the book ... And spoil yourself:-)
1451666179|5.0|Allie is a clever (and brave) young woman that puts her heart and soul out there for all to see in a funny, touching, beautiful way. I love her skill with words and a pencil, and would recommend this book to everyone!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Basic for a beginner to Bingo like me and its slow enough for me to keep up playing 2 cards. I hope to be able to play 4 at a time someday.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|estoy absolutamente decepcionado por este cd que tanto queria es una copia y no me di cuenta al hacer la compra! no me parece justo pagar 14$ por un producto q no es original me siento estafado.<br /><br />I'm quite disappointed by this cd is both wanted a copy and I did not realize when making the purchase! does not seem fair to pay $ 14.29 $ for a product q is not original I feel cheated.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Some of the greatest people and their success, brilliant. I liked the Bill Gates story and how he came to be.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|Loved loved loved this book.  I was taken into a magical world I never wanted to leave. Can't wait for her next book.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I wanted to show this off to my brother because he plays this game on the computer all the time and it worked I love this game so much!
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Graphics are fine and the game play, while generic, is solid as well. I agree with other reviews that there really need to add more content to it and I don't mean more items, I mean more missions. You are pressured a bit into making in-game purchases because the game can be a bit difficult to go through unless you grind out on the same level over and over again. Overall, The good thing is that all the problems in the game are fixable. Just add more missions and lower the price on a few items.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy this game. It's fun and the scenes are pretty easy but not overly easy.  I also like the different ways to find the objects.
0307719227|5.0|The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Fun film. I'm seeing comparisons made to MIB and I expected that because I could see the parallels but I enjoyed this film more than Men In Black. Some funny one liners. Good special effects.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is great you get to build and watch your city thrive while at the same time you manage it. I would highly recommend this game.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have the kindle fire hd 8.9.  It has a good tutorial to show you how to play. The game has every option and setting you could want for freecell.  I had no play issues and there no unneeded permissions.  If you're a freecell player, you will want this app.<br /><br />NO Wi-Fi required
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good game it's the best game I have found so far and l really love it.<br />I thought it was a regular online  RPG game at first  but it blow me away when I opened it and start playing.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|We are retired and loved Monsters, Inc. so when this came out we had to have it.  Actually thought it was better than the first movie.  It's a must have!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|happy that's it is on kindle fire now.  I have been waiting for this for quite a while.  I now have it on my phone, kindle fire, and computer
B00DH7P6WU|4.0|These dolls are much like the Monster High Dolls except for they are fashioned after fairy tales rather than the monsters of the old monster movies.  They are well made and have some really neat details on them.  My grand-daughter will love them!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had almost given up hope that Candy Crush would be available for the Kindle but it has arrived. Fun game with many levels.  There's something to challenge everyone because just when you think you've got it figured out, they add another twist at the next level.  It's a great game to play when you've got a few free moments because you can start it up and go. Be warned though, you may lose track of time because it can be addictive.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I play on Kindle, Amazon Appstore. Unable to get crowns and difficult to increase storage space and things take long time. Nice graphics
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I have purchased USB ports in the past just to find out the power of my laptop or even my PC USB port are not enough to power the units, even with the ones that has ac power that's just not enough but with this one there's a whole different story, I can connect 4 external hard drives and  all of them have enough power and I can have them connected all day long without any issues. Size is compact enough to carry with you anywhere, so far I'm loving it.
B00BQH9SY0|3.0|I love the music, but not really the lyrics. The songs are kind of depressing, like the artist is expressing that he is an outcast..
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|This review is only for the &#34;Special Look&#34; Instant Video. It played well and gave a good oversight to the show. Having watched the show ever since episode one (albeit only on TV; never via the Instant Video) I'd say the special look is worthy if anyone wants an overview as to what the show is all about.<br /><br />All in all, I like the show.  The characters are growing and I like how the writers give us glimpses into the characters' pasts. The action is good, but at times, the interaction between characters is equally as intense. I think my faves are the deep conversations between May and Coulson.  You have see how these two play against each other to understand my comment, but their interaction really brings out each important insights to each character.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend told me about this game today so I couldn't wait to try it. Love it! Lots of levels. Lots of fun!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I Love games like this one. This game is difficult enough to make you think but not impossible to get through.  It takes time to play.  I do not like games that are too short.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|funfilled game that folks of multiple ages can enjoy. take the time to try this you wont be disappointed. the only thing i would change is the cost.
B0000009S3|5.0|The best Zappa album he made, brings back the time it came out! He was great though weird but who isn't!
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|A beautiful and heartwarming story. I loved every word. It is amazing how love can live on forever. This story has changed me for the better.
0143038583|5.0|This book is a great guide to eating a more balanced and natural diet. It also makes you think about the industrial food industry and all of the harm that &#34;big Agra&#34; has done to our health.<br />Changed the way we eat in our house.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|These are exactly the kind of games I like to play. It is fun, time consuming, addictive and I have not one complaint except..... I just don't like how expensive everything is. Other then that, it's awesome and should be downloaded.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Disappointing.  I hope in the future i hope Lady GaGa will focus more on the music, less on the art.
B009AJDDQU|3.0|Since the trailer showed what happened at the end of the movie I'm going to rate this as 3 stars.  Cool, they crashed the enemy ship!  I felt like I got a lot of emotional value out of the trailer; simply feeling a greater attachment to all of humanity.  Hay, we really would still use 4 rocket boosters to go cross planet travel?  AWESOME!  Gonna build one in the backyard this weekend.  Actually, sounds like a lot of work; I'll have the kids do it while I play video games.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|I should have  paid more attention to what the Z stood for. Not a fan of Zombie movies. It started out pretty exciting as a post apocalyptic story and degraded into something that would make George Romero proud. Yawn.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Great for a Minecraft lover!  Challenging to assemble for my 7 year old, however, I found it just fine to put together.  A pretty cool Lego.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It;s a good read,  I found it not as thrilling as the earlier works but I too am quite a bit older...
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It's really not about kids killing kids.  It's about government out of control, how far reality t.v. could go, and how those with money & power are the puppeteers of the world that pull all the strings.  Sound familiar at all?
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Backup restore failed (no response from support email)..recurring tasks don't reoccur....alarms only work sporadically....basically fails on so many 'must work' criteria it barely qualifies as beta NOT a paid for app.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|It's about cage fighting, consequences of addiction, family conflict, need for forgiveness,  and love--an unexpected combination--skilled script writing and high level acting.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|no hassle, works as advertised, it is plug and play, works with my laptop or my tablet.<br />Streaming players can be a pain even when they work, because the remotes are too basic, forcing you to spell the title of your selection with the cursor keys one letter at a time from a alphabet block on the screen. Chromecast uses your laptop keyboard or the virtual keyboard of your tablet.
0452289963|5.0|Great book, opens your eyes!<br />Really helps you put your life into perspective.<br />Helps you see the positive in life.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very good, action packed, and very plausible in todays political/technical environment.  Thankfully, Mr. Clancy has returned Jack Ryan to the Presidency, although having his son a CIA-type operative is a bit of a stretch of reality.  Mr. Clancy and I share the same political and military views, and that's refreshing, again, in todays political environment.  Keep up the good work Tom!!<br /><br />Tom Lawless<br />Pinehurst, NC
B009PMB3CI|5.0|This game has fun activities to care for your little dog, Feral Heart is a great computer game, but this app is amazing!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I haven't even begun to play this yet but the previous two Quell games totally got me hooked.  I honestly would pay $20.00 for this as I feel it would be well worth the money.  Talk about engaging your brain!  I'm not one for the 'brain teasers' and such but I downloaded Quell when it was the free app of the day.  Even before I finished it, I bought the second Quell.  I'm sooooo excited to see there's the third one!  I've played both Quell's more than once and just can't tire of them.  Brilliant! You think you have it figured out then, BAM!  You realize you missed.  I love the way each set gets just a bit more difficult-you have a set number of moves you can make to finish the puzzle.  Sound easy?  Not!  This game (and the previous two) are definitely worth the money.  Promise!-you won't be disappointed!
B00CO4CVN4|5.0|Barrett keeps it simple and explains it to you like your 6 years old. Barrett Tagliarino is great at teaching concepts
B0090P98Z4|5.0|is simple fun game and I love the new changes like seeing what weapons and armor Max ratings r so u know what to use and build up
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Doesn't have any hints to help go beyond in the level your playing in. I can't play this game so it is useless to me.  Very disppointed in the game.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|trying to download app and wont finish it froze right up on my kindle<br />wont let me uninstall please help
B007STXHTM|5.0|Works and fits perfect. Did several splash from a waterslide video and shows absolutely no leaks. Seems to be able to handle Dynamic pressure well.
0140177396|3.0|Somehow, I managed to graduate high school in the United States without ever being required to read a book by Steinbeck. In an attempt to patch up the holes in my literary knowledge, I picked up &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34;. At 107 pages, it didn't take long to get through, and I understand why it's become a staple of English courses everywhere. That being said, I wasn't that impressed with it.<br /><br />The story is about two men, Lennie and George, who are on their way to a new work site near Soledad, California. (The name &#34;Soledad&#34; means &#34;loneliness&#34;; I don't know if Steinbeck's setting is intentional based on the translation of the name, but if so, it's one of the most impressive aspects of the book.) Lennie is huge, a wonderfully strong worker, but he's very slow mentally. George is smaller and scrappier, but he has made it his job to look after Lennie. After being run out of a job in Weed (in which Lennie, in his desire to pet soft things, accidentally scares a young woman when he refuses to let go of her soft dress), the two have hatched a plan to not be migrant workers anymore. George has discovered a nice, small house with some land, and the current owners will sell it to him for $600. He and Lennie only have to work long enough to save up for the property, and then they can finally have a place to call their own, where they will work the land and Lennie will raise rabbits.<br /><br />Once the two reach their new employment site (a ranch), they make friends with the other workers. One, Candy, wants to join them at their house and is willing to give them his $350 savings to make a down payment. Another wants to hoe in the back garden as a way of getting away from his current situation as the only black man on the ranch. However, the rancher's daughter-in-law is trouble, and while Lennie doesn't want to hurt anyone, he is much stronger than he knows.<br /><br />This is a story about friendship and survival, about what it means to be alone in themiddle of a group of people, and, in some ways, about what makes you human. However, I still wasn't that impressed with it. Some books definitely deserve the hype and fame they get, and while I don't think I'll forget the ending anytime soon, &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34; is a small blip on the radar of what I've read this year.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved the way the characters were all intertwined. I was sad when the book was done.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app is great it got rid of all unneeded memory that I would have trouble finding and deleting on my own.
1781162646|3.0|It is OK. Not great Stephen King writing in my opinion, though it is a more fleshed out, genuine set of characters than his typical horror fiction.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great!  Easy setup, easy to use.  I bought three and even put one into my smart TV so I could control it from my iPhone or iPad.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was FANTASTIC! Gillian Flynn has once again created a literary masterpiece. The writing will entice you and the story will engulf you! Five stars for &#34;Dark Places&#34;
B00009W0WM|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.  Can't count how many times we've watched this, and it never gets old.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I shook with silent laughter while tears streamed down my face. Excellent story telling and superior illustrations. Will recommend to everyone I know.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great writing, filming, and acting!  Beautifully set, historically correct about an era and aristocrats few have experienced.  Easily recommended to others....
014241543X|5.0|One of my favorite books. Couldn't put it down. Had me going the entire time...the second book is great too!
1476727651|2.0|This has none of the tension and terror that I remember from the Shining.  I stopped reading King after Cugo and Pet Cemetary.  Originally, his characters were fantastic.  They grabbed you and would not let you go, no matter the story line.  I can remember reading Carrie and looking for the news in the paper, it was so well done.  Then his love of horror took over and the characters suffered for it.  I am sorry that this one just was so pale.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|For a USB hub, it does most of what you ask of it. The reason I say most is that a USB hard drive of any kind plugged in when the device powers on will not be recognized. It's something to keep in mind, but for the most part it does a damn fine job allowing me to plug in multiple USB 3.0 devices on my laptop that's constrained in how many USB 3.0 ports it has.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Clever patter!! Writing excellent. Feel at home..I come from a family of lawyers! Love the main characters. Hope they go on a long time!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I can't seem to put it down.  I haven't found any issues so far.  The graphics are great.  Just wish some things didn't take so long to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's what you expect to get I mean its a dandy game for sure. Fairly addictive and at a reasonable price.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|I'm giving it 3 stars because I havnt played it yet but I played it on the computer and I just saw it was free now on the kindle so I'm getting it<br />intact its downloading. right now.I will update my review in the future when robots are around ok maybe not that far into the future lol!
0545265355|5.0|bought as a gift for an 11 yr. old...she loved it and I received it within 24 hrs.  I know I paid highly for the shipping but we had a snow storm and I could not go to the book store....it's good to know if ordered in am your purchase can be at your door within 24 hrs.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Having read Sherlock Holmes for the first time as an adult it was fascinating to see how he reads people and situations!  Great book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing this game for months. I can't get enough. I have it on my laptop phone and kindle.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I wish there was more bang in the last chapter.  And the Birmingham stories lost me to the concept of the book.
B00EDCI5IU|5.0|It is so very good, her voice just grabs you and doesn't let go. If you're unsure, download The Curse ( was a free download). The entire cd is even better.  My fav song would be Aventine, but all are good. You will not be disappointed.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|This game was very interesting. It kept my attention for the better part of a day. Nice activity for a gloomy day.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is one of the best devices that was ever invented to cast videos from chrome to TV. I use it every day!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I would recommend this book to everybody.  It is a great story of someone turning his life around. This book will really humble you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addictive . I really enjoy connecting to Facebook and sharing the levels I pass my friends on.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I can rate this show with two words; Eve Myles. I'm not sure what it is but there is definitely something fantastic about her.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|Another wonderful CD from James Blunt. I'm not disappointed. Very satisfied Fan. Love his voice!I highly recommend this new album!
8866131369|1.0|wrong one, my mistake after browsing for many of them i lost track of the one i ordered with the correct year
B00E9A656K|5.0|Cool game I liked it I wish I could have been the creator<br />U(If you liked it then try other games
B007G5O3K0|5.0|Well, I'm a true Morten fan. Morten has the most pure and beautiful voice. Lead singer for a-ha for 25 years and now on his own and doing quite well beginning a new tour. I enjoy all the songs on this album and look forward to his new one!

She became pregnant and gave birth to a baby probably because she was sexually assaulted by her father or a former boyfriend. At one moment, she imagined that she was a thin white woman who lives a glamorous life. But, she knew that her life was far different from that imagination.<br /><br />But, I loved that Precious finally escaped and protected herself and her baby from her evil mother.

However and fortunately, Precious declined and moved forward to a better and independent life with her baby.

The various taxes are covered, from VAT (what can be recovered and what can't) and stamp duty land tax to capital gains tax and inheritance tax.<br /><br />Definitely this is a practitioner's handbook and, as a handy work of reference, is easily navigable via, for example, numbered paragraphs throughout, a detailed table of contents and lengthy index at the back.  Even a brief trawl though the table of contents will reveal the astoundingly wide scope of this concise volume.<br /><br />Starting with the chapters on the nature of partnerships and common partnership uses, the book covers such matters as self-assessment returns, limited and limited liability partnerships, service and associated trading companies, and salaried partners and key employees.<br /><br />Foreign as well as domestic aspects also receive attention in the chapter on residence and domicile, for example, which includes sections on dual residence, change of residence and intriguingly, Scottish taxpayers.<br /><br />Other partnership issues such as insurance and providing for retirement, as well as salaried partners and key employees are covered.  Toward the end of the text there is a chapter each on mergers and acquisitions and investment partnerships which touches on private equity structures and Lloyd's underwriters.<br /><br />What distinguishes this book from a lot of other works of reference -- especially on financial matters -- is its conciseness and clarity as well as its logical structure.<br /><br />At the back of the volume you'll find further assistance on partnership issues in the form of four appendices which incorporate summaries of statutory accounts and audit requirements for Limited Liability Partnerships. Particularly useful is the chapter on managing profitability.<br /><br />And if you want to fully substantiate or confirm advice to clients, there are extensive tables of the relevant cases, statutes and statutory instruments for your further research.  Timely and topical, this essential practitioners' guide from Tolley's is based on the law and practices as at 17 July 2012.ook from a lot of other works of reference -- especially on financial matters -- is its conciseness and clarity as well as its logical structure.<br /><br />At the back of the volume you'll find further assistance on partnership issues in the form of four appendices which incorporate summaries of statutory accounts and audit requirements for Limited Liability Partnerships.

Until that happy day arrives, however, all UK tax advisers will continue to find `this book' an invaluable and certainly time saving purchase.<br /><br />The book contains much new material, which examines the various changes to collective investment following the implementation of the 2012 Finance Act which has affected all on and offshore funds and a number of other vehicles, including pension funds and life assurance.<br /><br />The chapter concerning the taxation of offshore funds has been completely rewritten following the gradual emergence of an income reporting regime for offshore funds from December 2009. Other chapters examine hedge funds, stamp duty, investment trust companies, UK Real Estate Investment Trust,  Pensions and life policies - to name only a few examples.<br /><br />For those needing to do further research, the book contains extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, as well as a lengthy table of abbreviations and detailed index of almost fifty pages at the back -- very handy navigation tool, that -- when you want to look something up in a hurry.<br /><br />Everyone involved in matters pertaining to collective investment, from practitioners to private individuals will certainly benefit from acquiring this concise, yet precisely detailed and very accessible handbook.

As such, the book fills a long standing gap in environmental literature, or indeed legal literature pertaining to the environment. `What is global governance,' it asks `and what steps can be taken to render it more effective?'<br /><br />As Maria Ivanova of the University of Massachusetts has perceptively pointed out, the book offers `a shrewd analysis of power and authority, individual incentives and collective action, management and regulation,' thus `building a bridge between law and politics'.<br /><br />The book is therefore multi-disciplinary and very successfully in our view, clarifies the link between `governance and law in the environmental regulatory domain', as the author puts it.  His achievement has been to create a single source which, as he explains, `brings together governance theory, environmental regulation and law from a meta-theoretical point of view.'<br /><br />Painstakingly footnoted throughout with a wealth of references, this volume of almost 350 pages certainly presents a broad and impressive range of research.  There is a massive bibliography of no less than eighteen pages at the back and an extensive index which provides the practitioner, or interested environmental researcher, with an important academic treatise that's easily navigable.<br /><br />Practitioners specialising in environmental law, as well as international law - not to mention environmentalists in general -- will find this book a useful and absorbing source of information and comment.  The publication date is cited as at February 2012.or interested environmental researcher, with an important academic treatise that's easily navigable.<br /><br />Practitioners specialising in environmental law, as well as international law - not to mention environmentalists in general -- will find this book a useful and absorbing source of information and comment.

Its constitutional importance, he adds `cannot therefore be underestimated.'<br /><br />`Practitioners today need to have a keen knowledge of a properly well-developed subject,' says Lord Dyson, a body of knowledge and insights which this book amply provides.  Taking account of the multiplicity of changes that have taken place in this field over the decades in practice and procedure, this book functions as an erudite and practical guide, which excels in accessibility as well as detail.<br /><br />Extensively examined in the book is the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly, as the authors state `those areas where Convention rights are likely to have an impact on the approach adopted to claims for judicial review, notably where such approaches may differ from the common law....'<br /><br />Aspects of EU law particularly relevant to judicial review are also covered.  Especially useful are the no less than nine appendices which set out relevant legislation, including the Human Rights Act 1998 itself and the Equality Act 2019 section 49.<br /><br />The authors have, for the most part, confined their dissertation to the law and practice in England and Wales, the occasional exception being, for example, other areas of public law relevant to this text.<br /><br />Destined, certainly, to become a definitive work of reference in this area of law, this volume should be considered as a required acquisition for practitioners.

A stereotype?  Well, only partly.  Wall Street, you will recall is in New York, (if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere!') where - as it in the US - the practice of insider trading is banned outright, not to mention religiously pursued and punished.<br /><br />With these thoughts in mind, this recently published volume from Edward Elgar, presents well selected and important contributions to the debate on insider trading from a team of twenty four experts headed by Editor Stephen M. Bainbridge, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).<br /><br />As the US laws on insider trading are among the world's most stringent, the book's initial focus in Part I is on US law and policy. `What were they thinking?' is the partial title of one chapter in this section, while another chapter discusses `the Facebook effect.'  Parts II and III go on to deal with empirical research studies of specific defendants, including an examination of governmental, as well as corporate insider trading.<br /><br />Part IV offers global perspectives on insider trading activity in Asia, Australasia and Europe.  Interestingly, the lone chapter on the UK deals with `strengthening regulatory law to combat market misconduct.'<br /><br />Interpolated among a formidable amount of research material, complete with extensive footnoting, are the cases which reveal the human interest - in fact prurient interest - side of insider trading; cases that involve \\"tipping\\", \\"misappropriation\\" and \\"pillow talk\\" in which romantic partners - often celebrities who end up on Fox News - reveal sometimes unwittingly, `nonpublic information' which one partner or the other can use for profit.<br /><br />As if insider trading didn't already have its own inbuilt fascination, the expert contributors to this book analyse it both from the legal and economic standpoint - hence the book's appeal to legal practitioners and students of economics, as well as academic lawyers and indeed anyone interested in insider trading, including all those financial folk in the City of London.

There has been a spate of widely publicized cases of late involving extradition - many of them unresolved at the time of writing.<br /><br />One recalls the cases of, for example, Gary McKinnon, Julian Assange and the notorious Abu Qatada.  It is also fair to say that the majority of these cases are fraught with problems and over the past ten years alone there have been a lot more of them.<br /><br />Note the observation made by the expert authors of this book from the Oxford University Press, namely that twenty-four people were surrendered under the European arrest warrant (EAW) a figure that mushroomed to 1,068 in 2010 - a more than 4,000% increase.<br /><br />In a quote from Lord Bingham, referred to in the book's introduction, (which we transcribe in part) extradition has been defined, as `the formal name given to a process whereby one sovereign state... asks another sovereign state... to return... someone present in the requested sate... in order that the subject of the request may be brought to trial on criminal charges in the requesting state.  The process also applies where the subject of the request has escaped from lawful custody... and is found in the requested state.'<br /><br />Extradition differs from deportation in that it involves, briefly, a request from one state to another to deliver an alleged criminal for trial or punishment.  Deportation, as the authors explain, is simply a unilateral act by the deporting state to expel an undesired alien.<br /><br />Over almost 1,000 pages, the book covers the full spectrum of issues pertaining first in Part I to extradition and in Part II, mutual legal assistance, (MLA) defined as the provision of assistance by one state to another in the investigation and prosecution of crime -- and later described as `an essential tool in the global fight against national and transnational crime.'<br /><br />Now in its third edition, this book on the often controversial, complex and ever-changing area of extradition is indeed a boon to practitioners.<br /><br />Note that it contains ample resources for research including extensive tables of cases, legislation and of treaties, conventions and other international instruments, as well as a detailed index at the back and no less than nine appendices.<br /><br />If you are involved professionally in any aspect of extradition and the issues it raises, you would be well advised to acquire this book.  Noting that the law within the text is stated as at November 2012, the authors advise that the up-to-date legislative position should always be checked, given the rapid pace of change in this area of the law.in the investigation and prosecution of crime -- and later described as `an essential tool in the global fight against national and transnational crime.'<br /><br />Now in its third edition, this book on the often controversial, complex and ever-changing area of extradition is indeed a boon to practitioners.<br /><br />Note that it contains ample resources for research including extensive tables of cases, legislation and of treaties, conventions and other international instruments, as well as a detailed index at the back and no less than nine appendices.<br /><br />If you are involved professionally in any aspect of extradition and the issues it raises, you would be well advised to acquire this book.

And the hapless and somewhat shamefaced clients whether claimants or defendants typically look bemused.<br /><br />Like so many litigious folk, they have staunchly insisted on having their `day in court' and never for a moment, it seems, have they ever considered mediation as an option.  But option it is - and increasingly so.  And if you as a practitioner wish to widen your perspective regarding mediation, (particularly if you have international clients) you need this book, recently published in hardback format by OUP.<br /><br />Within its 1,400 pages, the book places at your fingertips, the accumulated research and commentary on mediation of some thirty learned contributors from jurisdictions around the world.<br /><br />Describing and analyzing the law and practice of mediation in -- we count twenty-three countries -- this volume presents a wide spectrum of comparative research on mediation, its aim being to promote understanding -- and inspire discussion -- of regulatory issues.<br /><br />Mediation does offer a number of advantages.  As the editors comment, it aims to resolve conflict, ostensibly in the best interests of the parties concerned and of course it reduces court caseloads, freeing up considerable court time and costs both for the parties certainly, not to mention the governments involved.<br /><br />The book's 25 chapters are grouped under three headings, the first being `fundamental issues; the second, mediation in the European Union-- and in Part III, mediation in the wider world including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Switzerland and the USA.<br /><br />The book contains a wealth of resources for research, almost too numerous to mention here, but which include, an index of over twenty pages, copious footnoting and at the end of each of the chapters, extensive lists of literature, legal resources, legal instruments and web resources, all facilitating easy reference to the relevant research materials.<br /><br />Interestingly, the book began as an embryonic idea which emanated for the most part from the Max Planck Institute which was commissioned by the German Ministry of Justice in 2007 to prepare a comparative expert report against the background of the European Mediation Directive and which ultimately formed the basis for the (then) new German mediation law.<br /><br />We are summarizing here, but along with a host of other institutions and individuals the idea emerged of publishing a book for English-speaking readers - and here it is; an enlightening and up to date comparative insight into mediation law across a wide range of international contexts.<br /><br />If you or your colleagues are involved in any aspect of mediation, or for that matter, any form of dispute resolution, this book may well prove a revelation.

Virtually everything we do - and when and where we do it: eat, sleep, work, or play -- within, under, over, above, or outside of a particular space -- is based on, or dependent on design.<br /><br />This is a legal text on design law in the European Union and as the subtitle indicates, it is definitely a practitioner's guide - and of special interest of course, to IP practitioners.  The focus is on European community design rights and harmonized law across the EU on registered designs.<br /><br />Author David Stone, an acknowledged expert in this field, points out that such additional rights as trademarks, copyright and unfair competition/passing off are not dealt with in this volume.  Language problems and jurisdictional differences notwithstanding, his purpose is `to delve deeply into the law that is available and where it is not, to suggest what the answer might one day be found to be'.<br /><br />Writing in the foreword, Antonio Campinos, President of the OHIM [Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trademarks and Designs)] refers to the problems created by design law differing from country to country across the EU, adding that as design law has not been harmonized internationally, it has long been the \\"poor child\\" of intellectual property protection.<br /><br />However, he goes on to remark that the absence of international harmonization has its advantages, chief of which is that it allows contracting parties to invent new laws that protect adequately by taking new and emerging realities into account.<br /><br />The prime example is the adoption by the European Union of the Design Directive, harmonizing the laws of the EU Member States and the Regulation on the Community Design. The Directive therefore acknowledges the importance of design in differentiating products, thereby protecting their commercial value.<br /><br />Putting all this in historical perspective, while at the same time, placing it in its modern context, the book first of all provides an historic overview of the evolution of the legislation and goes on to provide  an authoritative and thorough examination of all aspects of the complex new legislation.<br /><br />Over twenty-three chapters the book covers all pertinent aspects of this wide-ranging subject, from the aims of the EU-wide legislation to infringement and remedies.  The final chapter presents the Design Directive itself and there are two very useful case studies.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love this book and I hope Aspen no longer gets in the way and America realizes Maxon is gorgeous, compassionate, caring,so many other wonderful things, and cares about her DEEPLY! If Maxon does not choose America I will be devastated and crushed beyond repair! I thought this trilogy would end in the first book and when I finished it I thought there is no way this can continue for three while books, but sure enough it did and I am very pleased so far. Why does America cause so much trouble?! She needs to learn when expressing yourself is ok and when it's not! Why would Maxon NOT choose America? I like Kriss but if she ends up getting Maxon I will not be a very happy girl!!!!!!! So there is just a little bit of me expressing myself and opinions! I seriously recommend this series to anyone who loves dystopian/utopian books like me! This trilogy is goin to be amazing; the first two books already my favorite two books! 10/5 stars haha! Beyond amazing!

Fortunately this basic concept of the `freedom of the seas' achieved dominance, although a multiplicity of legal hurdles remained.  The ensuing debates, in effect, culminated in the world's lengthiest legal conference, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III).<br /><br />Published recently as part of Edward Elgar's International Law series, this book is a compendium of learned essays and articles by leading experts on the law of the sea published between 1948 and 2011. The majority of the debates - all copiously footnoted - centre on the issues that emerged during UNCLOS III -- and their resulting impact on maritime law and governance in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />The book's thirty two articles are grouped under twelve categories to include, first, a history, then such areas as maritime zones, boundaries, regulation and enforcement as well as marine resources and environment, scientific research, governance, military activities, dispute resolution and freedom of navigation.<br /><br />Whether you are a practitioner, academic, or student, you should find this book of more than 800 pages invaluable as a research tool in this complex, continually evolving and quite fascinating area of international law. The publication date is 2013.

Or equally, if you are providing advice and representation in criminal matters generally, you would still be well advised to add this book to your professional library.<br /><br />As consultant editor David Perry QC observes, EU law is `an increasingly important influence on the administration of criminal justice in the UK - certainly a reality which all criminal practitioners - - not just EU specialists - must understand'.  This, he adds, is `an area of law with which we must all become more familiar', with a view to making a positive contribution to the future of criminal law in the UK, in which the influence and impact of EU law on the UK criminal justice system will inevitably continue to grow.<br /><br />Criminals, as well as ordinary individuals can flit across boundaries with remarkable ease and as information and communications technologies grow ever more sophisticated, criminal activities will continue to become ever more international.<br /><br />Writing in the introduction, editor Duncan Atkinson puts forward the book's stated objective as seeking to provide `clear practical assistance to those engaged in criminal law in this country as to how the increasing role of the EU impacts on them and their clients'.  He also states at the outset that the book does not seek to enter the too often controversial debate about the relationship between the UK and Europe.<br /><br />Nonetheless, as editor Duncan Atkinson reminds us, EU law takes precedence over the national criminal law of the UK and increasingly affects it even in areas previously regarded as its sole preserve, particularly following the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, which expands the role of the EU in maintaining `freedom, security and justice'.<br /><br />What is noteworthy about the book is that it presents the well substantiated comment and insights of a wide range of specialists in this field.<br /><br />Divided into three parts, the book's seven sections contain the input of more than twenty learned contributors and therefore a wide cross section of expertise.  To facilitate your further research, the book is meticulously footnoted throughout and there are extensive tables of cases and legislation, as well as a table of treaties, conventions and instruments, a table of abbreviations and detailed index.<br /><br />As the interdependence of the EU and UK in this area of law continues apace, every criminal practitioner should own a copy of this excellent book.

HERE'S AN AUTHORITATIVE EXAMINATION OF THE CURRENT LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Does one person have the right to enter another person's premises against his or her will and take that person's goods and property?  The answer, as practitioners are aware, is yes -- whenever the law allows.<br /><br />The circumstances under which entry, search and seizure are allowed - and under which laws they are permitted - constitute the subject matter of this well-known and definitive legal text, recently published in a new fifth edition by the Oxford University Press.<br /><br />The book's usefulness is unquestionable following the government's announcement of its intention to re-examine the current law pertaining to entry, seizure and distraint, with a view to drafting and enacting new legislation to curb what are seen as the excessive powers taken advantage of by bailiffs -- to cite only one example -- including powers, allegedly, to kick down doors in certain instances.<br /><br />Following concern about the proliferation of such powers, the practitioner is well advised to get hold of this latest edition of this authoritative text.  This is an extremely valuable contribution to the continuing debate on the extent of the powers of the state to interfere with the personal affairs, not to mention the privacy of the private citizen.<br /><br />If anything, the book certainly reveals the many and varied grey areas which currently loom over and inform (or misinform) just about any discussion of entry, search and seizure issues:  the use of force, for example.<br /><br />What is force exactly?  When may it be used?  As there is no absolutely unequivocal answer, the rights and wrongs involved remain arguable. Current laws, therefore, are in need of reform, which it is anticipated will be imminent and which will no doubt be examined in the next and sixth edition, we hope, of this excellent book.<br /><br />Covering any number of issues from the human rights context and remedies, to criminal investigations, civil procedures and revenue customs and excise, the book examines the significant changes in the law that have occurred since publication of the previous edition in 2005.<br /><br />The chief examples include the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 which came into force in 2006 and the provisions contained in the Protection of Freedom Act 2012 and its associated code of practice.<br /><br />Research tools abound, including copious footnoting, and at least fifty pages consisting of tables of cases, primary legislation, secondary legislation and international instruments as well as a list of abbreviations and detailed index.<br /><br />Certainly the book will update you authoritatively on developments in this complicated area of law.  As author Richard Stone has stated, the main text of this edition was completed as of September 2012 with further material added in December 2012.e next and sixth edition, we hope, of this excellent book.<br /><br />Covering any number of issues from the human rights context and remedies, to criminal investigations, civil procedures and revenue customs and excise, the book examines the significant changes in the law that have occurred since publication of the previous edition in 2005.<br /><br />The chief examples include the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 which came into force in 2006 and the provisions contained in the Protection of Freedom Act 2012 and its associated code of practice.<br /><br />Research tools abound, including copious footnoting, and at least fifty pages consisting of tables of cases, primary legislation, secondary legislation and international instruments as well as a list of abbreviations and detailed index.<br /><br />Certainly the book will update you authoritatively on developments in this complicated area of law.

0199662908|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo39F2CAPZJ5H8E]]<br /><br />FOR PRACTITIONERS AT THE CONSTRUCTION BAR<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you find life at the Construction Bar a tad challenging, this definitive text, published in this latest second edition by the Oxford University Press, should find itself permanently on your desk.  Each of its twenty-seven chapters -- which cover the full spectrum of insurance law for the construction industry -- is written by a variety of authors, all experts in this challenging and diverse area of law.<br /><br />The construction industry itself entails huge financial risk and considerable hazard for its workforce, as the authors point out in the introduction, adding with reference to the construction of the Gherkin in London, that in this risky enterprise, contractors and consultants share the chance of mistakes with the insurance industry. In an area of law dealing with long term projects usually valued in millions, this book, as the authors explain, is about how insurers and the construction industry share such risks.<br /><br />Distinguished for its clarity as well as its erudite and certainly practical approach, this book, in the words of its team of authors, is `intended for lawyers, contracts managers, risk managers, insurers and brokers working on commercial projects within the construction industry.'<br /><br />In whatever aspect of the construction industry - and its insurers - you are professionally involved, you'll appreciate the book's logical four part structure in which the diverse topics covered are grouped under four main categories.<br /><br />As appropriate to its subject matter, the book is well constructed. Featuring numbered paragraphs and meticulous footnoting throughout, it has not only a detailed table of contents at the front, but an equally detailed list of contents at the beginning of each chapter.<br /><br />All this, plus the sixteen page index makes this particular work of reference exceptionally accessible and easily navigable, especially when you are under pressure and you need all the help you can get.<br /><br />And as you would expect, there are extensive tables of cases and legislation.  Speaking of which, the book concludes with a final chapter on future changes in insurance law which, as its authors explain, looks very different from the similar chapter in the first edition following the progress made by the Law Commission to reform insurance law.  As this process continues, the authors optimistically predict that `the third edition of this book may be very different again....'  Which means that, once you've perused this current edition, you'll no doubt look forward to its successor!<br /><br />Published in 2013 and updated to 31st August 2012, this new edition is supplemented by a website set up by the RPC in collaboration with the OUP, which will update you on issues pertaining to the book's content.kes this particular work of reference exceptionally accessible and easily navigable, especially when you are under pressure and you need all the help you can get.<br /><br />And as you would expect, there are extensive tables of cases and legislation.

0857934309|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3KUE8AT9PFNQ2]]<br /><br />A \\"TEN YEARS ON\\" ASSESSMENT OF CRIMINAL COMPETITION LAW IN THE UK<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As Professor of Competition Law and Policy at Glasgow University School of Law, Mark Furse brings his experience and authority to the fore in writing this book, in which his primary aim is to evaluate the impact ten years on, of the Cartel Offence as set out in the Enterprise Act 2002.  Fundamentally, he feels that the legislation has not done enough to curb the often insidious process - and progress - of cartelization and, although wishing to be positive, he remains pessimistic about future developments.<br /><br />It should be borne in mind here that cartels are actually conspiracies, usually on the part of big companies, mainly to monopolize markets and/or fix prices.  It is not surprising then, that cartels are described in this book as an undermining and destructive force against capitalism, which, like it or not, is fundamental economically and politically, to the underlying philosophy and belief systems of western democracies.<br /><br />Quoting a comment from the Swedish Competition Authority, Furse describes Cartels as `cancers on the open market economy' and which according to another commentator, `serve only to rob consumers.'<br /><br /> `I take the view,' continues Furse, that cartels are not rare, that they are very harmful, and that they are organised in known defiance of legal prohibitions.' `Criminalisation and incarceration is an appropriate enforcement mechanism,' he adds, `but only where the conditions are appropriate.'<br /><br />Following the US example, the UK introduced the Cartel Offence in 2002 to curtail anti-competition activity, the main manifestation of it being cartels. We are reminded here that yes, there was a decision to introduce competition law into the UK in 1948, (the first anti-competition law in the UK since 1844,) but by just about all standards, it was ineffectual, as criminal enforcement rarely happened.<br /><br />It was not until the UK joined the EC (now the European Union) in 1973 that substantial financial penalties and remedial orders were put in place.  An intriguing historical perspective is offered here by reference to similar legislation enacted and enforced in the US - and the comparison between the two as outlined in this useful book is instructive.<br /><br />In all, Furse examines the key arguments relating to criminal enforcement of anti-cartel laws as a clear statement of the law in the US and Ireland, as well as the UK -- and considers in particular the role of the US as `global antitrust policeman.'<br /><br />As a comparative study of the criminal law of competition in the UK and US, this book will, no doubt, become a valued acquisition in the libraries of competition lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic.  The law is stated as at 1 April 2012.t by just about all standards, it was ineffectual, as criminal enforcement rarely happened.<br /><br />It was not until the UK joined the EC (now the European Union) in 1973 that substantial financial penalties and remedial orders were put in place.

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|We'll written but entirely unrealistic. The basic idea of a single company gaining too much power and then abusing that power under the guise of benevolence is fine. However, it was rendered in such absolute black and white terms that it caused wholly believable characters to appear flat and even silly in their utter lack of depth. The author seems to want the reader to ponder a wide range of weighty topics yet he was unwilling to allow the characters to engage in any substantive discussion that didn't come across as one-sided and shallow.

It really is a beautiful story and I couldn't put it down through the first 1/3 of the book. The writing is so strong and vivid that you feel like you are really there and there were times I found myself holding my breath. However, the story loses steam once the setting changes from NYC to Las Vegas.  While it's still a very interesting story and you find yourself attached to some of the characters,  I found myself wanting to skim in the middle because the writing had lost it's strength. Had the writing been edited for a tighter story this would be a 5 star rating instead of 4. Overall, I highly recommend as it's a compelling story and beautifully written.

This album has it's own sound with lots of different sounding tracks. It's a very mixed album with uptempo songs, slow songs, punk-inspired songs & tracks with a lot of feeling & soul. I like all of the tracks on this album & i really appreciate a band like PJ continuing to make music despite the criticism.  I hope to see you in Denmark soon.

And this movie shows us exactly how misinformed we are by first showing us the story as we thought we knew it then re-showing the entire movie over as she knew it and the second half is very disturbing and very sad. You are left with a much deeper respect for Linda and what she went through. As difficult as it is to watch it is a must see. Sharon Stones performance is one of her best even thought she gets little screen time.

B005R32L66|4.0|This works well on my Kindle HD.  Its not hi res like my laptop, but I didn't expect it to be.  It serves its purpose when I don't have access to my laptop & want to video chat with my grandson.  I recommend Skype for Kindle HD if you want to be even more mobile with video chats.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great graphics, really smooth game play. Like it better than the Facebook version because you don't have to be so reliant on friends and requesting all the time. Also, like the offline play option. Looks like they've built the world out pretty extensively, so the game should go on a long time too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent  book well written but no surprise.  One point I did not get. If this man changed his Will to give his vast estate to a poor woman and the money was beyond her belief or ability to deal with it , would the jury really think he would be worried about the tax portion?  If I was Seth,s lawyer I would of brought up that point.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|I think the first one was better this one was long and kinda repetitive dont get me wrong it wa a good movie to watch once
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Wow, what a fantastic game!  It's very addicting.  The objects are usually in different locations providing challenges.  In the dark mode, you need to use your memory to find the objects faster!  Highly recommend!!
B00650SSDU|5.0|This is such a cute movie I love JT and Mila together they have real chemistry i like this movie so much I bought it
1423101499|5.0|What can I say, it's Rick Riordan and Percy Jackson. I love this series!! I have to compete with my son for who gets to read it first (he usually wins because he can read faster than I can). :)
0307477401|1.0|a thoroughly miserable read and a plot that did not 'hang together'.  I was left wondering: is the author suffering from early altzheimers?
B0000000LI|5.0|If it's possible to wear out a CD I've come close. Yanni's gift for music is off the charts. If you appreciate good listening music that you can think by, dream by or just relax and listen too; allow yourself to be carried away by his obvious passion for above average music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game to play with friends from facebook. Very addictive game play! Tons of levels. Some in game purchases available but not required you can request help from other friends playing
0780619951|3.0|Only bought this film because my favorite actor is in it. It's okay at best, freaky, Brando was more like Jabba the Hut but it did show how far down man will go to establish his own legacy. The creatures were interesting, mostly it seemed a bit slow except at the end when the creatures rebelled.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Excellen!  I couldn't put it down from page one. The characters are developed in depth. It is a book of adventure and intrigue. Very thought provoking.
B000066C6Z|4.0|Again, chose this because of the lead guy. Funny, bawdy...definately not for the whole family. A lot of the acting was a little stilted but he was pretty young and new to film at the time. Typical Mel Brook's style. Good play on words and interaction with the audience.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham doesn't disappoint! Believable plot, interesting characters, moves right along. Wish I could write like he does and had the imagination to create a story.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This is the best Wyatt Earp film ever. The action, cinematography, music...all come together perfect. The cast was believable. Doc, of course was the favorite. This is a Kilmer role that should have, hands down, brought him an oscar. The movie version, unfortuantely, cut out one of the best single character moments in the film when doc was alone in his darkened room, coming to terms with his fleeting existance and questioning his life. Would say it's as good a western as Searchers was.
B0055SWM08|2.0|At first I was enjoying the game until the puzzle that locked up on me. The third time I re started my tablet I gave up and deleted this.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Can't wait for next season! Just watched the first few episodes again while we were at the Royal Hawaiian in Waikiki. Great purchase.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Well written, well dialogued.  The acters are right in with the character..the upheaval is managed articulately by ,<br />Alecia and Kerry
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I am enjoying this game.  It has a storyline that catches your attention.  Just enough difficulty to keep the game interesting and challenging.  The puzzles are varied.  The map makes it easier to get around the &quot;game board.&quot;  The hint button will help if you get stumped.  But I do miss my &quot;hidden objects&quot; puzzles.  Overall, a good game.
0671004107|5.0|A statement and defense of Sagan's cosmological philosophy.  Very similar (in some respects) to Arthur C. Clarke's 2001.  Definitely recommended for anyone interested in SETI or the philosophical consequences of finding intelligent life in the universe.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This is a great value and I noticed no problems with the dvd, so I bought another one as a gift.
0451452739|5.0|One of the great sci-fi novels.  A classic in every respect.  An epic journey that takes you from the depths of the universe to the heart of consciousness itself.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Ya this game is nothing but fun .  .  . Addictive it is lol play it all the time all the time lol
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have to say that I'm really enjoying this game so much! I especially love the graphics and the intuitive gameplay.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Keeps me using my brain! Don't use it, you lose it! I would like updates on this game, no glitches just brain work!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book!  Engaging, obsess worthy, enthralling...you won't be able to put it down!  I was so affected by this book and the characters that I wasn't right for weeks after finishing it!  LOL  If YA or chick lit is your thing, and you haven't read this book, you're missing out!  After reading this book, the word &#34;Pigeon&#34; will never mean the same...ever. again.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|An easy read with an interesting point of view on fighting and overcoming the battle with resistance.<br />I recommend this book to anyone, thanks to Joe Rogan for the recommendation.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I have always enjoyed playing free cell on my laptop now I have this  on my tablet and I really like it, runs very smoothly no glitches. Thanks
B00003XAVA|5.0|First I bought the album, then I bought the cassette version. Now I own the CD.  This is great music.  It's the late 60's in a package! Crosbys voice is unbelievable, the songs are great...Can't say enough about the quality of this music!
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book was an incredible story that ended perfectly.  I haven't read any of the other stories, but I can't see how they could improve on the story's end.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I think Veronica Roth is a terrific writer.  I loved the first two books and was completely enthralled.  This third book didn't have the same grasp on my attention though.  It wasn't that it was poorly written; I was just disappointed in what was outside the gates.  Finding out what was going on outside the gates made the first two books feel pointless and since I loved  them, that was a bit heartbreaking. Between the heartbreak and my lack of interest in the explanation the third book gave, I had difficulty enjoying this book as much as the first two.<br /><br />Hints at potential spoilers ahead:<br /><br />I read other reviews that slammed the book for the conclusion. Some valid points were made but I thought the end was fitting...or fitting enough that I wasn't overly upset.  Of course, there were enough clues in the book that I knew where it was going and I was able to properly prepare myself. And though my initial reaction was that it was a sad ending, it was also hopeful in a way.  And though maybe most people would have preferred another ending (myself included), this one worked too.<br /><br />That said, I won't likely read this book again. There is a part in the book when Cara and Tobias are talking about how important the factions once were to her and how the government made her feel foolish for caring.  I guess I feel her pain on that one.<br /><br />One more note: why is this book called Allegiant if the Allegiant are such a small part of the book?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is a very entertaining and thought provoking book. It is easily one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone.
1603420398|4.0|Very clear instructions to make hundreds of different patterns.  Many of the patterns created a way to use up bits and pieces of yarn.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is awesome, I just like it. The one thing I don't like its that when your play the game it doesn't have the same graphic when your picking your armor.
141694737X|5.0|I was given it by my aunt and Uncle in 1990 when I was 4 and I have loved it since. It's a delightful lift the flap book for all ages though will be loved most by those learning to read I think.
B00GNL251C|4.0|Not fond of reading subtitles ..lol But action was off the charts... This woman is a very tough woman. The martial arts did not look rehearsed. Every butt whippin looked like it hurt lol
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is a good game but you should be able to get boosters without having to touch your wallet.<br /><br />The same comment applies to going to additional levels.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Its Bruse.. Really? 5 stars across the board. He is an amazing awesome talented actor. Its a realistic action movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt is an exceptional writer who holds your interest and makes you hate to stop reading. Her vivid descriptions make you see, feel, hear and taste what's going on in the story.  You can't wait to see what happens, but you just don't want it to end!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I play minecraft and that was my favorite game for kindle but this blows it away. It's litterly the best game I've played. Endless hours of fun.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|the disc was scratched beyond repair. was only two chapters but after watching friend's copy were pretty crucial to the plot
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|The game is really good; but it needs to give more coins than what they give you. They should have different rank rooms.
B000078DOI|3.0|bouht this for nostalgic purposes.....LOVE 3 or 4 songs but the rest are too avante garde n hippy-ish.....and again trying to fill the word limit
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great and fun game very addictive..like playing, free game, enjoyable and it keeps your mind going, there should not be a word minimum on these reviews
034580404X|1.0|Repetitive n lacks writing skill..  sorry I purchased all 3 books!  Boring. Not worth the money spent.  Fanny Hill was better for smut!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very very addictive game. You can't put it down once you start! I've played it on my cell and on here.
1577314808|5.0|This is what Jesus said, this is what Buddha said, it's what Joel S. Goldsmith said. Eckhart was given this insight to restate what IS in a way that sends you back home where the infinity of peace and love rest.<br /><br />For those who are trying to wrap their heads around this book- don't. This isn't one for our minds. It's one for YOU, and all can say \\"ahhhh\\" as long as they are patient and read with their hearts.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|So much like Grand Theft Auto, but a smaller city and not as many little details that make a great impact. Lots of profanity, (well that's in both) which is a downside, but the best thing about it is that you can drive whatever car where ever you want and so many missions as well
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|This is the third novel in the Inner Movement series. Lightyear was just a division of Omnia, and in this book, we find out more about Omnia and how evil and powerful they really are and have been throughout history. I was eager to read this to see whether or not Nate and his allies would be able to defeat Omnia. There were so many odds against them. What makes things even worse for them is the Inner Force, a faction of the Inner Movement, who believes that violence is the only way to stop Omnia. In many ways, they are almost as dangerous as Omnia itself.<br /><br />Omnia has taken over, and people are being unjustly imprisoned, sent away, and killed. There are some horrifying moments in this story, particularly when Nate visits another dimension called Carst. As with the last two books, there are several exciting scenes that will keep you glued to the pages.<br /><br />So many questions that you have probably had since the beginning of the series will be answered in this book. I kept wondering what exactly the Jadeo was and who Nate was really meant to be with.... And if you were curious about the dark mystic, then you will finally get to meet him.<br /><br />This is a really fascinating series that does not disappoint. If you have already read the first two books, you definitely won't want to miss reading this one!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|PRISM is PERFECT! Roar, Unconditionally, Legendary Lovers, This Moment. I love it! Katy Perry the best POP singer ever ;).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another story that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next. Interesting characters that you grow to like and dislike. I enjoyed this book.
B000UZPIAW|2.0|You can only read about his drug use so many times..the behind the scene stuff he talks about is interesting but few and far between..the book could have been wrote in 100  pages..it gets old fast..don't recommend it..
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Too many ads and constantly asking about downloading new games.Of course you can turn them off for a price. No thanks not that great.<br />I
0316017930|5.0|As a grandparent, I read this at the urging of my son who is a stay-at-home parent to their adopted daughter.  She is a bright girl and could easily get by at age 8 with little effort—but because that will not be true for all her life she needs to learn how to work/study.  &#34;Outliers&#34; is vignette after vignette telling of ordinary people, who by a twist of fate or other uncontrollable factors, were able to take advantage of a circumstance to/for their own advantage.  Literally, a &#34;prepared mind.&#34;
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Beetlejuice is a movie that was done to perfection, therefore is timeless, enjoyed no matter how many times it is seen, and despite the grisly sights it might have within, remains warm overall.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I don't read sci fi much anymore, but this book was excellent. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the tale.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My roommate literally played this for two hours straight. He's going to buy a kindle now just to play this game
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I enjoy the continued difficulty of each level.Just when you think you figured everything out you get surprised by the new challenge.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is an amazing game. The graphics are stimulating and the music is just amazing yet calming. I spent hours replaying the game over and over to unlock all the specials and even had friends and family sit down to try the game after I first got it. The controls are simple and it really just brings to mind that the destination is not always as exciting as the journey itself. Only sad part is that it is mulitplayer but only if you play with people online though they do it in an interesting way that you would have to experience.<br /><br />Flower was beautiful. Once again the music is amazing though in this game the controls take some time to master. To me it felt like it was meant to be a game that you would play to get your mind off of things and as time progressed it just became a classic I would play again and again.<br /><br />Flow was fun. This one was more difficult than the other two but in a way the difficulty was good because with some practice (recommend flower first the controls are similar) this has been just as addictive. It also holds the ability to play multiplayer with others using one console instead of having to play online with multiple people.<br /><br />There is a lot more added as well but they were small projects by the same company and though they were done for charity purposes I wouldn't have touched any of the others period.<br /><br />One last thing the game cd downloads the full games into your console. once you have the games there you don't need the cd anymore though i would still keep it for just in case you ever need to redownload the games.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game! Just need more lives. Make this available. Just wish I could play longer. How can I receive more lives without Facebook?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Absolutely loved the first two books in the series, so despite all the bad reviews and warnings I knew I had to read it. Well I wish I hadn't! The first half of the book was kinda boring. Totally not what I was expecting after reading Divergent and Insurgent! Then when it started to be actually good, Tris was killed. Now, don't take me wrong, the fact that Tris was killed isn't the reason for my low rating. I am aware that the life is not always fair, but the way it was put into the storyline was a big disappointment for me.<br /><br />In general the book was written poorly, and the storyline may as well have been written over a weekend.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I have been looking for a free hunting game to try out for a while now I'm enjoying it so far, hope to see some more in the future
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I really like this game. It is a shooter game and gives you targets to kill and different ways to kill them. My only thing that I don't like is every level you have to up grade you gun. They insist!! Then this little rating bar keeps popping up before you have even had a chance to play the game. I think by the 1st 5 levels you should know by now if u like or don't like a game.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Difficult for wife and I to play.  Didn't let my 2 y/o give it a shot for fear he'd break the kindle trying.  Having to start from the beginning after each death with the video foreplay is painful when you die so quick.  Maybe I don't have the skills I used to. This was a bigger challenge for what I thought would be a fun game for my son.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is a very addicting show. I couldn't quit watching. All the actors and actresses were great. Jeccisa Lang was outstanding. Just make sure you have lots of free time because you will not wont to quit watching.  Loved it so much I bought the next season.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome Free! Very addictive! Haven't been able to put it down! My daughter has been waiting for her turn VERY patiently.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved the first season so much I purchased this season. It is also great I was not disappointed. We'll worth the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesomest game ever!It is much better than any other minecraft copy.Me and my sister play togather sometimes.You would get it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am at level 445 on my android phone and ipad but the kindle version only goes up to level 440 at the moment. I'm still happy that I can play it on my kindle HDX, but unfortunately it's not up to date on the levels so I'm giving only four stars for the kindle app. Please update soon!!!
B00EUUJID6|4.0|Three incredible young Italian voices do an excellent job on this album. If you like Christmas music, if you like opera, if you like slow pop, then this is for you. Perfect for the season. These three deserve every ounce of success and praise. Christmas music is generally a favorite genre of mine, but they do it justice. My favorite is probably the Jingle Bell Rock medley and Feliz Navidad. Perfect music for the whole family.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|I think it deserves the top prize it won. For me the style and setting invoked a real feeling of the time and place of the late 1800's on the West Coast and finally gave an insight to those old posed photos of bearded men in hats and women with huge dresses. Despite it's length and complexity it is very readable and engrossing.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|It's not that often that a book falls into your hands which makes you stop and think, reassess, consider and smile in recognition, and most certainly not a book which could be considered a textbook rather than a view of life as we see it in our day-to-day lives. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is that famous exception which attempts to prove the rule that not all is as it seems. It is a textbook which appeals to the masses, written in a free-flowing and easy style which appeals, which draws the reader into ever complex ideas, into a deep spiral of realization that our lives and thoughts, our actions and reactions are not quite as simple as we may wish to believe.<br /><br />We are subjected to a vast array of situations each and every minute of the day, whether we realize it or not, which require some form of decision. Some are seemingly automatic, some require more thought. Many can change the way our life goes from one moment to the next, can alter our opinion, can bring drastic financial, emotional or other major changes depending on the information we have, the information we consider in forming our judgement. Let me give you a current example:<br />A young gay woman posts a service receipt to the Internet which shows a refusal to give a tip because the customer does not agree with her way of life.<br /><br />Many people will have immediately formed an opinion on what has happened simply from this one-sided statement, this public action. Reading through Kahneman's book, however, we get to see that our opinion is based on a lack of information, on information which has also be augmented by recent events, memories of similar actions, personal feelings. We see that our opinion is formed and accept it as such without necessarily knowing why we came to this decision, or even how. We also learn that our decision, since we have no other information than that which is contained in one statement, could well be false, formed through misinformation or a lack of appropriate information.<br /><br />Decision making based on information received is a far more complex act than many appreciate. For most it appears to be a very easy matter: we read what is presented to us and base our final reply, our actions and reactions upon what we already know coupled with what we have been given. In fact, as Kahneman points out, there are several levels involved in good decision-making, and we do not always take advantage of all the possibilities. We take, automatically, the easy way out. Sometimes we do not even address the problem at hand, but seek out a simpler, related problem which can be answered quickly, without too much thought. We do not delve into the depths of a problem, but take it at face value.<br /><br />With a wealth of examples, Kahneman takes the reader through many different scenarios covering how we think, how we make decisions, what we use to arrive at our decision and how this process can fool us. He does it, however, in a manner which is easy to understand, taking us gradually one level after the other towards the more complex problems of risk and reward. Each stage is covered with plain examples, then completed with more information, and a solid explanation of how we arrived at our first decision, how further information, even a slightly different wording of a problem, might have changed the manner in which we think, the result of our thoughts.<br /><br />Let me return to my example (above). The information we have, at first glance, is that a young gay woman has been refused a tip despite her service as a waitress. There is nothing to suggest that the level of service received by the customer was bad, their refusal to tip is based exclusively on the fact that she is gay, and they do not agree with her lifestyle. If the service was not bad, we reason, then there must be another excuse for not tipping: this is given to us. We automatically imagine a very conservative family, straight-laced, set in their ways, not in tune with modern society and the acceptance of different lifestyles, different personalities, different sexual orientation. We recall that there have been many examples in recent months of people refusing tips to waitresses for the most obscure and irrational reasons. Coupled with this, we remember that many waitresses - and other customers - have picked up the bills for others who they felt either needed financial assistance, or who had, through service to their country and fellow citizens, earned it in one form of another.<br /><br />This background knowledge influences our decision. We feel offended that anyone could refuse a tip for someone doing their job properly simply because of who they are. Some will feel the need to comment on the family involved, even though they know neither the waitress nor the other people. Some will feel the need to compensate the waitress, who has done nothing wrong. With his clear examples, Kahneman shows us that this is not unusual. We have reacted to the information presented, coupled with what we already know from elsewhere, and come to a decision. We take some form of action, even though we have very little information to go on. Our reaction requires very little thought, it is, in effect, a very shallow reaction and absolutely normal.<br /><br />What when we receive further information, though, could this change our attitude? Two more pieces of news may have reached us after we had initially reacted:<br /><br />The waitress is prone to excessive lying.<br /><br />The family concerned publish another copy of the same receipt without a handwritten comment, but with a tip.<br /><br />Our available information has been greatly enhanced, and our decision about the whole course of events changes drastically. There is more than a shadow of a doubt cast upon the original story. Our thought processes go beyond the shallow level with this new information and, in all probability, our opinion of the waitress and the family she served changes: we side with the family.<br /><br />Decision making is an everyday part of our lives, even for the smallest things. It is automatic, in most cases, and requires little apparent thought, even though our thought processes must be active. Decision making, so clear-cut and easy, is far more complicated than we had first imagined, taking more information - present, past, learned, heard-of - into account in a fraction of a second. In his highly accessible work, Kahneman takes us, one step at a time, through the thought processes involved across several different levels and shows us how we work, where, through a lack of information or just pure laziness (on the part of the mind) we might be failing ourselves, making errors which could haunt us for years to come. He brings complex psychological thought across in a factual and fascinating manner, and makes us, the reader, consider what we are doing, how we made a decision, and whether it was, after all, the right one.ne with modern society and the acceptance of different lifestyles, different personalities, different sexual orientation.

This book motivated me to try some ideas I had been thinking about and gave me more (and better) ideas to implement in order to do better work.  I highly recommend this book to other free agents and to those considering taking the plunge into a more fulfilling work lifestyle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The most fun web site on the internet. It is so easy to get addicted to. I am!<br />I find myself using the web site even when watching t.v.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a fun way to relax and relieve the stress of the day.  I would give this a try for any one, you can do 3? To 240 pieces all depends on how short or long of time you wish to spend on it. I say what have you got to loose?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love legal thrillers and especially the writing style of John Grisham. The character of Jake Brigance, brought to life in the film Time to Kill is one of my favorites. I looked forward to reading this book every day and hated for it to end.
B000FCK65W|4.0|This is one of those books I had always meant to read, but never had. I loved it and would recommend it to women especially, but anyone who enjoys a really good story. If you liked Angela's Ashes, you'll love this as well.
B005EHILV4|4.0|Nice little unit for the price. Easy to use and USB-powered. I'm using mine for vocal tracks.<br /><br />Mine did NOT come with any sort of driver installation disc so you have to download the USB drivers from the Behringer web site:<br />[...]<br /><br />The Behringer site ain't the most intuitive site around. The confusing part is you WILL NOT FIND any reference to the 302USB mixer in the download section. Since it's a Xenyx mic preamp you go to the section titled \\"Xenyx/U-Control\\" and download the driver titled \\"USB Audio Driver\\". Very confusing. Would have been easier if they would have just included a disc or had the web site indexed by model number.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm very much addicted to this game but get aggravated at it sometimes too when it takes so long to get it solved..
B004PGO25O|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone who is taking on a challenge or stuck in their endeavor.  Mr. Pressfield does a wonderful job identifying why we all get stuck, and walking us through and onto success.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Slow start-kind of confusing. I Didn't get understanding of<br />the good guys and bad guys until about 34% thru book.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good Movie for what it is.  Frustrating at times (for several reasons), but Denzel is entertaining and the movie good enough to recommend.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Engaging and compelling. It is realistically disturbing that images of childhood experiences impact lives forever.  The novel gave us a look inside the legal world, and the setting portrayed the myriad issues a small firm experiences daily.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|best movie ever. You cannot beat it. I had to make my boyfriend watch it and suddenly he is finding all these subtle hints in video games. One video game had awards called &#34;2 swallows&#34; &#34;bridge troll&#34; and &#34;killer rabbit.&#34; It's just something you NEED to watch. You aren't human if you haven't.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A FANTASTIC book!! One second I was crying my eyes out and the next I was laughing so hard. It is one of my all time favorite books!! John Green is amazing and I can't wait to read more of his books.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game brings both challenging and fun together. This is a great game for all ages, it`s challenging but never impossible!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite books I've ever read!! I love the way the story is told. I felt like I was in this world and I never wanted to leave it.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|thank u for making it free :) I love this game it is wonderful great I love it its amazing wooing cool
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Heartbreaking.  The matter of fact, retelling of incidents that most people can never imagine being subjected to are awful, but told as iff it's just the way everyone lives in NC.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Awesome. Definitely one of the best book of the series so far. Ever looking for something to read? If so read the kid lawyer series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great fun game.....gotta be quick with your swipes to get far...bonuses help.  be careful though as this sucker  can get addictive fast!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Always makes me laugh, cry and swoon.  I could almost wish all writers were as capable of the kind of command and use of wit as Ms. Austen displays in her writing. She writes like Da Vinci painted.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love puzzle games and this one is different (in a good way!) from all of the others I've played. While it does keep track of the time you take to complete a level, there are achievements both for doing them really fast and doing them really slow, so there's no pressure. For each level you can see the the number of moves that is the minimum required to collect all the pearls, and if you match it you get a coin and a gold check mark. Each level also has a jewel hidden in one of the blocks that you reveal by running your rain drop into the block and seeing it crack open. It takes several hits to reveal the jewel, so you can't get the perfect score and the gem in the same play through.<br /><br />The coins you earn can be used to unlock a level or locate the hidden jewel and can be purchased for cash along with some other optional features like a permanent jewel finder. So far, I've earned plenty of coins to use when I'm having trouble finding a jewel, and there aren't any nag screens that have popped up, so I don't find the cash shop aspect as intrusive as some other games I've played (Candy Crush Saga, I'm looking at you!)<br /><br />Playing the game is very relaxing - there are no flashing lights. obnoxious sounds, or timers counting down, the game alerts you when you've made a move that makes the level impossible to complete, and you can hit a button to reset the level without any penalty (no limit on the number of tries). My only quibble is that the game automatically sends you to the next level and stage when you've completed a level, so it's a bit tedious if you want to go back and replay a particular level to find a jewel or get a better score after you've completed the level. The game also forgot all of my gold check boxes after I restarted my tablet, although it remembered the jewels I found. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature though, because it allowed me to replay the levels where I already knew how to complete them perfectly and earn another coin.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|When you first get this game, it seems like you have found the perfect youtube app. But that is not true it's slow!!! It keeps saying it will come but it doesn't.
0307476464|3.0|I wish I could give this book 3 1/2 stars because it was certainly an enjoyable read I just did not enjoy it quite as much as I have some of Murakami's other works. I do not think that the problem is that I disliked the book or had any major problem with the story (it may be a bit wordy at times, but come on it is a thousand pages - wordy is why your here) it is just that all in all I feel quite apathetic about it. I think that the apathy comes from my removal from the story, as a reader, I just was not able to connect with it.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|The best basketball game to buy and play me my wife,son,daughter we love this game and I need to warn you about nba madness 14 it's Bella fake only a puzzle game an  it cost 99 dollars on a kindle but this game is the best game in the world now when I have my kindle with me because we have an Xbox and a kindle I take the Xbox remote and the kindle when we go to sleep and I started this this week and now my kids come in my room when I'm asleep and try to take the kindle but I always catch them
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really like knowing what really happened.  Although it was a little difficult to keep straight when they actually attacked I still loved the book.
B003L77G6A|5.0|It's the best comedy on TV. It's well written and always funny. I look forward to every new episode and like to be able to go back and watch previous episodes
B001NLKT60|5.0|Story was intricate and wove story line together.  I liked the character development and the twists and turns in the story
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Good pace.  Not just action.  I enjoyed the intrigue of the plot.  Bond and Co uses mind as well as muscle.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Good read, lots of information that has been told before but in a new light. Amazing how many of these CEO's feel guilty after they have left their companies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is great<br />it could be a bit of lag but it is so addictive<br />buy it now people!
B00AX6KNOY|2.0|It's pretty ridiculous....bizarre plot, painful high school acting, and pretty much makes no sense. Hard to imagine this movie actually has decent ratings on here -- probably just because people are fans of the cast members .<br /><br />I'm usually a SyFy junkie too....but this just pretty much sucked -- save your time unless you're really bored or on something.
0345308239|5.0|The examples are illuminating and the writing style coaxes you to turn page after page of history well told.  She also wrote the Guns of August...which John F. Kennedy cited as a source he referred to when making his decisions during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Well, Gerard Butler is in it. It has a good story line and the story line keeps you interested. It is a good movie for all ages.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Thought fully done and I watch it several times a month.  However, this version of Kahn does not come close to the one created by Richardo Montalban
B00B7Y0206|1.0|im using a kindle and it doesnt even let me install the app!! i wanted to download this cuz thd youtybe on the internrt on my kindle doesnt load!!
B00CJ6PHII|5.0|Twists and turns. Complex. I like that. The explanation behind Sherlock's 1 year chip and why it doesn't work for him. Interesting and good to know.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album is another proof why Lady Gaga is always one step ahead of any of today's pop stars.<br />It's pure pop.<br />It's chaotic.<br />Give it a try, forget what the tabloids write about her.<br />Enjoy the music.<br />It's the best pop record of 2013.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|AS  usual  they were FANTASTIC!!!! cant tell you how these three young men lift my spirits! I took my sister and my darling daughter to see them in concert over in Phoenix this fall, and they both loved them as much as I do. looking forward to seeing them again!!!
0143038419|2.0|Sorry, but I gave this book to my daughter thinking she would like it , but she said it was really boring. I can only go on her opinion.
034580404X|5.0|A gift for my girlfriends birthday that she absolutely enjoyed. Never read it myself but she seemed to have enjoyed them so much that she wouldn't shut up about the book for weeks!
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Very inappropriate for children, but it had me rollin in the isles several times throughout. If your looking for some laughter, I recommend it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is fun to pass the time I like it better then the pass deer hunter games I have played
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun to play. It's Enjoyable. I Just started playing today and can't stop! This game is GOOD for all ages.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is for people that enjoy logic. It's flow logic. It works. It's addictive. And it's fun. The interface works well on the fire but it's slow on the phone. The colours are pretty. The sound effects can be missleading, it appears to be a sore looser. It will give you a buzz if you are too quick for it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood.  The picture and sound quality is the best I have seen for this film.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Challenging game which uses good graphics and easy controls to balance the pain in the backside need to be constantly upgrading the weapons. Why is there 20 word requirement for the review?
B004IF8TLU|4.0|Yes, four stars is a little high.  I must admit I am biased as this movie came out when I was a less critical movie goer.  My daughters 5 and 8 loved the film.  However, I did forget the amount of swearing including an F bomb which my five year old used the next day.  There went my parent of the year award.  So maybe watch this one without the little kids.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. I use them in my work 3-8 hours/day, 5 days/week. They have excellent clarity. What I like best about them is they have out lasted every other pair of headphones I've ever had. I've used them steadily for 12 years. I have gone through several sets of headphone ear pads - but they are so inexpensive, it does't really matter. I use noise canceling head phones for clients, and I have been through nearly a pair per year that were similarly priced. I have had so many others that have plastic parts that have broken, or sound quality diminishes. Not with these! Buy with confidence!
B005UKJX4E|4.0|Captures the nostalgia of 50s (small town) America. About growing up both from an adult's and child's perspective. Amazing imagery.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this without a purpose. I live in Israel and we do not have Netflix. Just for You Tube it is not worth it. Add more money and get Apple TV or Roku if you hate Apple...:)
B00FLDG5BE|1.0|My wife and I attending both nights of this show at Madison Square Garden and had a great time; but this Blu-Ray is annoyingly impossible to watch.  The audio-video synch is way off.  I am shocked that this was put on the market with such poor quality.  Returned mine for refund.
0399215921|2.0|Another Carle book, that was not clearly advertised as a miniature book. The fact that it is 3 inches tall should have been emphasized in the product description.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|its a fun game and one well worth checking out. I liked the art style and the premise. game loft games are always pretty good bets.
111846446X|5.0|This is a very informative text and I would recommend it to anyone entering the world of the Raspberry Pi.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Terrible - don't waste your time look at this movie. Sorry I even paid for this movie. Amazon should take it off its list of movie.
B004GTLVIQ|5.0|Probably my favorite of the series, actually.  Lots of intrigue and adventure shuffled into a new and interesting background from Scotland to the New World.  Not a book you can read out of sequence though.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Always wondered what it'd be like to have a horse. It's expensive for sure-this game allows the freedom from the bills and only has good times
006202406X|1.0|Someone posted that when they finished the book the felt dead inside, I have to agree.<br />SPOILER<br /> I don't have an issue with killing off characters, goodness know all the books had death but the deaths in the end didn't make sense and completely killed any desire to re-read the series or become invested in the movie.  Ms. Roth, you blew it - should have waited until after the movie before destroying your fan base!
B005VSRFEA|5.0|Seeking a primer on systems thinking, and learning that Donella Meadows co-wrote the classic, 'Limits to Growth,' I knew that I had to read, 'Thinking in Systems.' Mrs. Meadows has surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />She begins with an introduction to systems, defining concepts such as feedback loops. She then discusses what makes a system resilient. She includes an analysis of how systems can surprise those who try to model them, making the prediction of systems behavior challenging. She concludes with ways to solve systems problems.<br /><br />A must have book for anyone seeking alternatives to the reductionistic tendencies of many current scientific theories, 'Thinking in Systems,' should be required reading for policy makers, social and natural scientists, as well as engineers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The Apple product has updates at the app store on ure kindle it doesn't update when u want it two so ure friends will have it before u.
B004H83IM8|4.0|Great product. Does exactly what it is supposed to. I use it regularly and very much enjoy the fruits of its use. No complaints from me and my side.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book as a teen and it's been a favorite of mine ever since. I recently saw the movie, so I thought it was time to re-read Ender's Game. I would recommend the book to anyone.
0061655546|4.0|Good book. It was highly recommended for my marketing and sales training, and I agree that it both informed and helped me as a sales and marketing professional.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This is a great app, but does not download at all. It just says &quot;Cannot Install.&quot; That's it. I have enough storage space. That's too bad......  (Kindle Fire)
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|super funny i laughed threw the whole thing love everone in this movie worth buying for sure a must see movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy it it is worth it they will add infinite world caves ravines and more next update don't waste you time sitting there buy it you will love it once you get used to it it's amazing it's a world of creativity if you didn't  buy it then buy it now there will be much more features soon enough they will also add a devastating flint and steel in creative please buy this adventurous game it's only $7 it's not a waste of money but they won't add vast features like ender men nether the end etc because it's to much data AKA To much lag so please don't spam be nice and check for updates once in a while<br /><br />  Updates come every month also please if u del uncomfortable with the game please write nice comments and tell the mods and admins about problems that are happening to the app. Thank you
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this i was able to get rid of my cable service. I use this and Hulu plus on my phone and went from paying 130.00 for cable to 7 bucks a month for hulu. best little thing ever
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|YOU PEOPLE MAKING BAD COMMENTS NEED TO SHUT UP THIS GAME WORKS FINE IT IS NOT THE WORST GAME EVER YOU CRUEL PEOPLE HAVE TO PLAY UNDER A BUS THERE'S NO GLITCHES OR CRASHING BE NICE ITS BETTER THAN YOU THINK SO STOP SPAMMING JERKS!!!!!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Great story line fitting for the 50th anniversary. Well produced and the acting was good.  I'm looking forward to more.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Fast paced, easy to play, love the neon feature. Great brain game for the cognitively impaired. It helps me retain brain function. Well done!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have used the kindle app on all of my Android devices, since I bought my first HTC Evsearch box searcho 4g. One of the things I liked most aboutttherehere Heythis app was the integration with theto store. Purchase an eBook and within minutes or even seconds it was synced to my device.<br /><br />That's why I was exasperated this morning when I did a search in the kindle app store and it opened a seperate browser window. WHAT was the logic there...? &quot;Hey, let's make it harder for customers to get content.&quot; Stupid move Amazon, more and more like Apple every day.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|One of our favorite movies.  We're big Justin Timberlake fans, mainly of his acting.  This is probably our favorite role of his.  I get a little frustrated cuz there's several chances for him to dance and he does little of that and that guy can dance.  I love the flash mob scenes.
B001F12J48|3.0|I couldn't use my  own 3 D glasses on LG 3 D T.V.  Have not tried the cheap 3 D glasses enclosed
B005LAIHPE|5.0|My wife can't stop watching this.  We loved it in the movies and I especially like the guy who seems to actually have two fake legs and their time on the mountain top defending the world.  And the Art of War move by our hero rules.
B004QKNXIQ|2.0|This is not a great movie. There is very little character development, and, to me, it felt like almost nothing happened during the course of the story.
0790742780|5.0|This is a classic.  Robert Duval and Michael Douglas do a tour de force of good guy/bad guy acting and Duval's wife, that actress from the 60's and 70's is incredibly brilliant as his housewife wife.  No film like this.  &#34;I won.&#34;
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best free hunting game I got. I would recommend this game to anyone who want to try it
1594746036|5.0|Clever use of plot. Photos were enlightening. Enough twists to keep it interesting. I would recommend it to all my friends and book clubs.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun :) It is an entertaining game and is a great way to pass the time. I love this game :) the minion s are so cute
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|because i didnt know this girl could sing but lord she can i see a amazing future for her in singing glad i brought this
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I buy Grey's Anatomy every year for my Granddaughter she loves it. I e-mailed her this year and asked her did she want the ninth season. She said of course.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a unique book that I enjoyed reading after having seen the movie.  I read it in Kindle format.
B0091VTNZC|4.0|This was hilarious, heartwarming, and who doesn't love a wonderful Christmas movie.  We watched it with our kids and grandkids.  The idea of a family movie ordinarily sets my teeth on edge, but this one redeemed the concept.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|a perfect gift for Alien lovers! this is a very nice set. includes all the movies, and two discs with extra stuff. Buy it! Great price!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It has been a long journey reading the amazing Wheel of time series. A Memory of Light was the last book and wrapped up the story. It is hard to believe that it is over. Like The Lord of the rings, it left you wanting to know more about what happened to the people you have just spent over 15 years getting to know.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I think that the guy that created this game deserves a big thanks!!<br />I LOVE THIS GAME SO SO SO SO SO MUCH!!!!!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like all the adventures and great story line n clues<br />And all of the different scenes it keeps you wanting to play!
B007N8RULO|2.0|I did not like the structure of this game or how it played out.  I deleted it from my Kindle.
0439023513|5.0|I LOVE this series. I hope that helps make your decision to buy this easier. I loved the ending. And I'm glad she ended up with the right guy ;-)
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Absolutely best move. Ever. Very well done, lots of action, funny, and the characters all work well together. I've always been a Bruce Willis fan, but have been disappointed in the DieHard franchise since the third one. This move redeems Bruce, at least in my mind.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is truly addicting! I love it. It helps me unwind after a long day :) It's better than I thought it would be #
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|There are so many bad puns and references to other movies in this movie that it's ridiculous. But that's what I love about it -- they basically make fun of each other every chance they get and have fun doing it. Lots and lots of action and very little storyline, but isn't that the point in a movie like this?
0451209338|2.0|Really dumb story, just plods through in its unhurried way.  Silva writes well stylistically, but is just not a good storyteller.  And I never quite bought into the author's view of his characters, which is fatal in just about any story like this.<br /><br />I found it impossible to take seriously the master of disguise bad guy who can travel everywhere without problems, escape cleanly with false documents right after major incidents, play a Frenchman, a French Canadian, etc. etc.  Just silly comic book stuff.<br /><br />And I have to comment on this other silliness as well: As some others have observed, the idea of a famous fashion model as undercover agent is just dumb, we're supposed to believe that no one recognizes her in London, although she's been on major magazine covers.  At the same time, apparently the \\"Kill Artist\\" is recognized right away by a person who only saw him once in a stressful situation (I don't want to give away the plot in case anyone cares about it).
0553386794|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend it was in excellent condition and actually bigger than I thought it would be. Prompt shipping.
B00BC254I8|4.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />It took a lot of guts for Tyson to face the truth of his life much less put it out there for all to see.  This is a look into the real person that is Mike Tyson with all his faults, flaws, and sense of humor.  It didn't feel as if he was trying to justify his life or actions, just informing or explaining what he's been through and what he's learned from the experiences.  You'll read about things you know, and wished to know. I got the feeling he hid nothing and faced it all. On a personal level I'm proud of his years of sobriety and facing his demons. I lived through my mother's struggle to accomplish the same thing and it was no easy feat as it continues to be on a daily basis for anyone who tries to live a life of sobriety.<br /><br />(I received a copy from publisher for an honest review.)
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I have seen all the batman movies made to date, and this is one of the better ones. It is a well directed and acted movie with a gripping storyline and excellent special effects.
B003QCCS36|4.0|Great music and a great performance throughout.  Ray LaMontagne is a real rising star in the music business.<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app! I would recommend this app to everyone. No matter what version of the Bible you like, you have it here!
B000MV90IU|5.0|This classic movie is one of Steve McQueen's best efforts, up there with &#34;The Great Escape&#34; and Papillon.&#34;  The car chase is legendary because McQueen did some of his own driving and the actor who was driving the Charger was REALLY driving it.<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B002EMESSM|3.0|Way too drawn out with scenery and close ups of the crew. Too much of the same look. All I can say is they must have had a small budget. The movie would have been maybe 45 minutes if they left out the shock and awe of the crew and all the blinking lights. I like seeing Spock and the original crew so I watched it all the way. I thought living in space would not age a person. But I was wrong. On to the next episode.
0790749815|5.0|One of Hitchcock's three best movies, possibly second only to &#34;Psycho.&#34;  Funny at times, thrilling at others.  Beautifully filmed across mid-America.  If you like Hitchcock, you'll love this one.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love the game but if u hit a wall or something u crash so easily. The computer cars or fine. But your car crashes so easily
0307950689|4.0|It's not as gripping as &#34;The DaVinci&#34; Code, but it's a good book and  worthy of a movie version.  I think Tom Hanks has already signed up.  In typical Dan Brown fashion, the story is as informative as it is exciting.<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|lots of fun! so happy I can finally get it on my kindle! I agree it is very addictive though! well worth it!
B005B19UPE|5.0|Sad, sad, sad story of a holocaust event and right up to date.  Well written, this page turner will deprive you of sleep.<br /><br />Paul & Jo Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|I love, love, love this movie! It is funny and it is way cleaner than most movies put out these days. I feel comfortable letting my children watch this (with one small bedroom spot that needs to be skipped), something I cannot say about many cartoon movies even. There is a small mention of infidelity in the movie but it is just mentioned.<br />The cast is great and I am so glad they kept it clean!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This is the absolute best Garth Brooks collection.  There's hardly a hit missing and the video disk is spectacular!<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I'm not much of an action movie person but my husband is so I decided to give this movie a try. It is a great blend of action with a strong story line. I loved it! My husband loved it. Perfect for date night or teens.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies whenever we feel the need for speed.  Blu-ray just makes it twice as good!!!
0689835604|5.0|A classic. One of our favorite authors. You should check out all of her books, they are all so cute and the babies are so unique.
B007JNR518|5.0|So much better in Blu-ray format.  Our old DVD looked like a post card on the screen of our new TV.  Buck Brannaman never really got the credit he deserved in the theater version.  This Blu-ray Disc has special features and Redford finally mentions how valuable he was to the production.  After all, he REALLY IS the horse whisperer!!!<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is an amazing action/adventure game.  One thing that is the best is that you don't have to have WiFi to play solo.  Then whenever you have WiFi you can do dungeons with other players.  Overall the gaming experience is amazing.  I love playing this game with my friends on the bus ride to school.  The game still has a couple bugs, but they are not noticeable at all.  This game is amazing and I defiantly recommend it to any one.  If you already have the game and if you haven't realised it yet but it is a slow passed game.<br /><br />In this game you have 4 classes to choose from.  You have the battle worm.  He is a knight type.  There is the blade master.  He is a speedy warrior.  There is the war mage.  He is like a wizard.  Then there is the (I forgot the name.)  He is basically an archer.  My personal favorite is the blade master.  his speed and attack speed is amazing.
B000002IAS|4.0|Several good songs in this collection.  The group inspired many musicians back in the late sixties and early seventies.<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoy WW2 non-fiction and have read many. It's rare that you get 2 sides of a story in such detail. The research and impartial story telling make this a great read to one of many improbable happenings during the war. Improbable from the standpoint of what happened and the fact that both men survived to tell the story.
B001684L0A|5.0|Superb in every way.  It won all the major Emmy awards and they were very well deserved.  The music will lift you right out of your chair.
B004PGO25O|4.0|Great reminder that evil takes many shapes.  Basically a kick in the butt to get one going again, we've all been there
B0058A119G|5.0|Truly the best Barbra Streisand album out there.  The lyrics of the Bergmans are unsurpassed and their collaborations with great composers have become legendary.<br /><br /> Just consider for one moment - Michel Legrand, the Bergmans, and Streisand.  What could be bad about that?
B004478AS4|5.0|After spending a bit of time in West Africa and being very confused about how the people think and the customs, this book explained a lot of what I experienced in my 2013 journeys. I am Black American and recently married to a man from West Africa. This book should be required reading for high schoolers around the world to understand part of history. The book is well written and engaging. Would have like more development of surrounding characters especially Okwonko's wives. Then it would have really been great.
B008C20TDG|1.0|If you want to cultivate an eating disorder, this book's for you! Chock full of junk science and body shaming, too.
B002ZG980U|2.0|What was that?  A movie about dreams?  Really........that's odd, because I fell asleep and had my own dreams while watching this hard to follow, overblown, weird movie that neither entertained or made me want to stay awake to see how the end would turn out......I never knew where the beginning was!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This app (candy crush saga )is a good app but it can get very old but sometimes it can be very difficult to.
B008OHV5HS|5.0|March of Progress................how appropriately titled.  After the death of Mac it was a no brainer to bring back their original vocalist, Damian Wilson.  The result defies explaining as this is nothing less than a tour de force in musicianship, vision, and performance.  Threshold has always been a, &#34;GOOD&#34; band.  However, with March of Progress this should elevate them to being a, &#34;GREAT&#34; band!  Enough of the comparing Mac's vocal prowess VS Damian.  Both are outstanding and it is extremely sad that Mac passed away.  March on, Threshold!!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I had so much fun reading this book. People were flat out crazy in the 20's. It seems so foreign only 90 years later. I love the way Mr. Bryson gives you a wonderful back story on the characters. Thanks.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game males you think. It's easy to learn and really draws you in. It starts out pretty easy but the difficulty is adjustable so it has a lot of replay value. Definitely worth the money.
B008602KQI|5.0|Interesting plot , plenty of action, and a surprise ending. Acting was very good and the filming was also excellent.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really wanted there to be more info on Peeta and her like married children I don't know wanted more!!!!
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|This is the worst Oz movie I've ever seen. The plot line was poor, The cast selection stank really bad. I've seen the price at a little over $14.00. Hollywood, why don't you make a better remake. I think the 1939 movie called The Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland in it and other actors that lived at the time was a whole lot better than this movie. Money can always be refunded. Time spent watching garbage like this movie is gone forever.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so cool at first I just thought it was  just a pattern tapping game but it is so much more it's like a robotic mortal kombat!
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Those of you you haven't watched 24, need to get the series.  I rate this series as the best I've ever seen.  Kiefer Sutherland is remarkable as always.  The good bad guy.  Just love him!  The 8th Series, the best of them all.  You do need to watch the first 7.  Please come back 24.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I am the grandson of Charles Werling and I read this book in my sixth grade class, with my teacher Mr. Wade. I read it again on my trip to Chicago and it was still awesome. It talks a lot about religion and it is beautifully written. It has a great ending and I almost cried. If you have the choice, it is a great book to get, and it is great for all ages, but might be a little hard to understand for small children. But grown ups will love it too.<br />FIVE STARS FOR A GREAT BOOK
B00BKZUVGM|3.0|Ah! I was so pissed off with this. I've been reading this trilogy from the very start and I was so excited for the final conclusion and for a HEA.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />But for crying out loud killing the main character is not going to go down well with fans! I mean I get that real life doesn't end happily every single time but god, it's a book, and I read to get away from the nastiness of real life.<br /><br />I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy reading this, because I did. I liked knowing the background to the factions, and how it all started. I liked getting a ending to the series. But I did not like reading that Tris had died. I seriously was in shock and kept thinking &#34;On the next page she'll be alive.&#34; But when Tobias saw her dead body I knew it was over and my disappointment was immense.<br /><br />Overall, the book was technically good. It was captivating, had good grammar, an interesting plot line etc. But because I was so looking forward to their happily ever after, I just can't rate it higher than this.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|truth !!!! I promise I read A LOTS of review and all th&eacute; bad ones said it crashed!!!!!!!!!!!! so it was kinds upsetting most to kindel fires so do NOT fet<br /> it!!!!!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I've got something to say to you haters:<br />1. 505 Games and Re Logic are partners<br />2. This game doesn't suck<br />3. How is Minecraft better when Terraria has like 10x the amount of stuff<br />4. How is a 2D sidescroler a rip-off of Minecraft
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Extremely we'll written. Makes one think about the course of history ! History comes alive and personalized in a warm friendly manner.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|Its a ok thriller but really did not find scary at all. Sometimes seem to slow but good twist along with investigative moments.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered the Chromecast on Friday Evening from my iPhone.  I was away on Saturday, but when I came home on Sunday, the package was in my mailbox!  My account shows that it was delivered on Sunday, but I don't normally get Sunday delivery.  I was amazed!  Kudos to Amazon for such a quick response!<br /><br />The setup for the Chromecast was fairly simple.  I plugged it into an empty HDMI port on my TV and plugged the other plug (connected with a separate plug from the opposite end of the HDMI plug) into a USB port on my TV.  The device is powered through the USB port (an optional power cord is provided to plug into an outlet).  I then ran a setup app from my laptop which found the Chromecast through my network and set everything up.  This took about 15 minutes.  The app placed a &#34;Google Cast&#34; icon on my Google browser that enabled me to &#34;cast&#34; content  from a tab on my browser.  In addition, I was able to stream content from HBOGo, Netflix, YouTube and Pandora to my TV.  I watched a show on HBOGo and was able to switch to another tab to surf the internet while the show continued to play.  Pretty neat.  To playback from an iPhone or iPad, you download the Chromecast App and you can stream content from these devices via your home WiFi setup.  You run the original setup once and then just install the App on other devises and you get the &#34;Cast&#34; icon on the additional devices.  It doesn't get much simpler than that.<br /><br />The device doesn't everything I'd like it to do, but it's pretty good for the price.  For instance, I can't stream content from my NAS drive to the TV, but I have a WD TVLive that does this just fine.  Also, I have to go back to the particular app, such as HBOGo, to control playback, but these are minor issues given the price of the device.  Kudos to Google for creating such an inexpensive device that delivers as advertised.  Hopefully, support for more applications will come in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Excellent game, very addiction, a must for all, it will keep you coming back and back and back.  Get it now.
B00GNL251C|1.0|The last 2 films I rented from amazon were Grandmaster, and Barbie and the three musketeers. I recommend Barbie. If you want martial arts, get the original Ip Man not this poor remake.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|My favorite Pink Martini to date! I had seen them in concert this fall and this CD is pretty much all the songs they performed.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Wow. Couldn't get past first scene. Totally stupifyingly boringly inane.  Because Amazon wants me to write more, I will add, this movie is not worth your precious heartbeats.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive! Helps pass the time away when in waiting rooms or when you need  distractions distractions from the stressors of the day.
B00DIDORH8|5.0|Original Batmans on Blue ray look amazing! Even though I mainly got it for the first two, but to have the complete set, along with my other Batman trilogy and animated ones in blu ray, makes it that better.
B00006RU5B|5.0|One of the rare albums that is great from start to finish. Recommend listening straight through rather than hoping for tracks to turn up in the Shuffle.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Haven't seen the Hunger Games yet, but was heavily pressured to get it and watch it, so I just received it in the mail. Amazon, you are a great company!! Can't wait to see what all the buzz is about.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It is a fun little game, but too many interrupting screen prompts.  I'm sure it gets much harder. I'll enjoy it I'm sure.
B008JFUUQ2|1.0|Product was sold to as NEW and when it arrived it was used and so badly scratched it was completely unusable . It looked like it was cleaned with sandpaper .
B0096HI226|1.0|The worst movie ever. No acting, long periods of nothing, and when they did talk, it was completely degrading and inappropriate.  Terrible.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good way to pass the time. Very fun. Makes you think ahead for the next moves as much as you can.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|After downloading months ago I finally had the chance to dig into Kitchen Confidential and 36 hours later I finished and wanted more......  Great book!!!
B00GII9UCW|5.0|A wonderful selection of great old music in a great new way. They have taken the songs of The Everley Brothers and brings back that great old spirit. I enjoy playing this throughout the house. Brings life to my place.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The graphics are wonderful! I love this game it is amazing! One of my favorite games for the Kindle! Love it!
B003A3K3JW|2.0|I originally sold this soon after buying it several years ago, but when I recently purchased the Decca 20-CD boxed set of 'Rites' by various conductors, I looked forward to hearing this, imagining that my original judgment was probably hasty and that a new hearing would win me over. Nope. Listening to 'Spring Rounds,' for example, I hear the basses burping out their notes clumsily and gracelessly, with no sense of gravity or mystery, and in the conclusion of Part I, Dudamel again youthfully misjudges, not realizing that greater tension and power can be achieved by a skillful, graduated buildup, rather than intensely fast speeds. His haste makes a lot of waste: his headlong and rush brushes aside all obstacles, but also brushes aside, again, any sense of real mystery or power--the two elements that I tend to think should suffuse any reading of Stravinsky's Rite. Some reviewers here have in the past accused conductors such as Dutoit of garish and shallow readings that work only as sonic blockbusters, but fall short musically, but it's far more appropriate to level that charge at Dudamel. So now please proceed directly to the 'unhelpful' button so you can express displeasure at my criticism of this most recent, shallow, 'sonic blockbuster' treatment of the Rite.
B002VWNIDG|4.0|Despite Stanley Kubrick's blatant disregard for the integrity of Stephen King's work, The Shining is great on its own.  I saw this as a kid before I had ever read the book and was in awe of how frightening and real everything seemed.  The woman from 237 is terrifying.  Shelley Duvall's acting is not all that great, she is cartoonish and silly but then, the character of Wendy in the book is a clueless twit so it fits.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|Was ok. I sent see Jaime Foxx as a president and also this movie is an exact copy of Olympus has fallen.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|LOVE this game! great for kids of all ages, but, my pictures will not save on my kindle fire. its also a bit pricey. Still a wonderful recommended game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game!!! :) very addictive so if you have something that needs doing, it won't get done :) can play for hours!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I recently bought the “lite” version of this app, and my kids loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the paid version.  If you have kids that like nature or animals and are looking for a perfect solution to keep them entertained and educated at the same time, stop reading this review and go for the paid version.  Both my kids love this one, and as far as apps go, this particular one has the best visuals I have seen in a children’s app in a long time.  The theme is aquarium, and it has modes like sky puzzles and beach puzzles to reflect the theme.  My kids –especially my youngest – love nature and the beach, so of course they love this app.  As far as the learning goes, this app primarily exercises the child’s memory and spelling/vocabulary skills.  My youngest son’s favorite game is letters puzzle, which targets memorization.  If you want your kids to be ahead of the curve when it comes to critical thinking and spelling skills but still want them to have fun and enjoy their entertainment time, then go ahead and purchase this app.  You’ll be glad you did.
1469220474|5.0|Most amazing love story of Eva and Gideon and am dying to get book 4 for the continuing saga of the lovebirds.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game.  Although I think it could be improved: allow us to visit &#34;neighboring kingdoms&#34; and give special offers so that we can &#34;buy&#34; more crown for free - like most other games out there.<br /><br />Overall, I play it daily and it's a blast.
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|This is a true classic. Anyone who is at all into music should see it. It's also a great coming-of-age movie.
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|we bought this for our daughter for fun and my husband took over,  i guess the little boy in him has not grown up :),
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Okay, I understand why so many diehard fans are distraught. But the Divergent series as a whole is brilliant. Veronica Roth created a world, and characters that are believable. In this series I see Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and George R R Martin all wrapped up.<br /><br />The story is brilliant, the characters are brilliant, and the ending is brilliant and REAL. The problem with YA novels these days is that nothing is BELIEVABLE. Life is not perfect, things don't go your way, and death is tragic and real.<br /><br />The fact that people reviewing this poorly, and blogging about how Roth disregarded the demand of her audience is ridiculous; I give her props for sticking to her story and not changing it. That is a true writer. And whenever I found out she is only 25 years old? Insane. The woman is brilliant.
B00A4AIYHW|5.0|bought for a friend, she says he daughter loves it and takes it everywhere they go, she bought this as a back up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun and I really enjoy it! If you want to keep your mind off of something else, this really distracts you.!
B005P3NPXG|5.0|This was a present to a dear friend of mine who is a big fan. I never really got to listen of any of the tracks, but she mentioned to that she just love it and was very thriller to own it! This explains my 5 stars.
B00881VLCE|5.0|A really fun way to play puzzles without losing your place or the pieces! I absolutely love it and so do my grandkids.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS  HAS THE BEST DETECTIVE STORIES EVER. THERE IS ONE  EPISODE, &#34;SEEK&#34; THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH. IT TOUCHES YOUR HEART.
B0000048V8|5.0|This is a time old movie that enchanted the childhood of my children and continues to delight today.  This is a timeless enjoyment.
B003XSSR4W|4.0|Old group but still great music. Baby blue was the best song but some of the other were quite good. It is GREAT tobe able to understand the words and lyrics sang by this or any other group rather than the TRASHTONE Lyrics and supposed talent that is offered today!
B00DNCUX8G|1.0|Didn't work to great for me. Have to constantly adjust the cord for it tk charge. Ive tried 3 micro usb cords and they all don't work that smoothly in my experience. Want to return this product as soon as i get the time.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Reliving the series , still cant believe its over! Best TV show besides The Sopranos. Look forward to the Saul Goodman Spin off.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Years of fan dedication to the band, and vise versa are obvious. The beginning to end (without a break) of their most popular album (Moving Pictures) is a testament to their excellence after 30+ years.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I usually spend my time doing other stuff, but when I am on this phone, I spend most of my time playing this game. It does take a little while to get used to the controls, but otherwise it is just fun, challenging, and hilarious. Hope everyone plays it.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|If you have surround sound you won't regret this purchase. Presents the album in a whole different way. Great addition to any Rush collection or someone just getting to know their music.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a EPIC game but it loads slower than the Apple products also is very fun and advanced<br />I can play for several hours :o)
B003J27WFW|5.0|Put's the very private band Rush into a perspective many don't know. An informative and entertaining way to discover one of the most regarded yet underrated rock bands. Showcases their 30+ years of professional and personal relationship. A great way to learn about the &#34;band&#34; behind the music.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I downloaded this app and I can not put it down this game is so fun. It Is a must
B00E9P959O|5.0|The remixed version sounds much cleaner - the difference is astonishing. The new mix has clarified parts that were buried in the original. This version should be added to any collection already having the original Vapor Trails. If someone is a first time buyer, go with this remix.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am so glad I got candy crush  on my kindle  me and my brands love to play it . The only thing that is bad is having to wait to get more lives.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Boring game unless you have nothing better to do than watch money being pushed around. No challenge at all fo us.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Just started playing today and I'm already hook. Don't know what took me so long to play but, happy I did.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked it, but didn't love it.  I thought it was boring towards the end.  I wanted to punch Abby at times...ugh she drove me crazy!  Up until 75% I thought this was a 5-star book, but after the conclusion, I am giving it 4 stars.  Not sure if I will continue with the series.  I liked it, but didn't love it enough.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I thought the storyline was very good, and I liked the fact that the characters were reasonably well-developed, with real, believable personalities and vulnerabilities.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|My favorite book genre is murder mysteries - this game gives me the opportunity  be an active part of the investigation.  The graphics are clear, the puzzles are enough of a challenge for me and, though I haven't gotten to ID the murderer yet (decided to give my review now to avoid numerous reminders), the story line is interesting.
B003VWU2WA|4.0|Just purchased and installed to use with my Windows 8.1 Pro machine, and it works great. I'm using it purely as a volume control knob, I haven't tried customizing the controls for specific applications, but as a volume control it's dope. I downloaded the latest Windows drivers from Griffin technology's site - v2.0.1, which say they're for XP & Vista, but work just fine with Windows 8.1.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is very fun an I love it and pc is epic but the game delver is a lot more fun.<br />Go search it up and get it.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Number of yawns while reading the book (85)<br />Number of times dropped the book and fell asleep (25)<br />Number of times sighed - when will it all end (320)<br />Number of times wondered why Fielding wrote this sequel (35)
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Poor Script and bad editing. Can't figure out what the film is trying to say. The whole story line was confused and it made me confused. I started watching with high hopes but it didn't turn out that way.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A very well done documentary, if you are from the era there will be a ton of memories and a lot of behind the scene stuff you may have never know about the music industry.  The story alone regarding the NEVE is very impressive.  A must see if you were a child of the 60's and anyone who wants to relive the rise of the great band era of our time.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|good movie but the main actor sucked. the guy just annoyed me.  they should of got hayden christiansen to be the main actor.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The book is very well written and puts the protagonist into several different situations to give a view of life in North Korea in different settings. The tone is both heartening and terrifying.  The story line gets a bit far-fetched toward the end which is the reason I only give it four stars.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Game is a fun way to relax whenever you have a few minutes to escape.Of course I would like to earn lives faster but I enjoy the short reprieve!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I've attended the play many times in London and various cities in the U.S. and find this concert version outstanding. In fact, I had watched this concert version several times with friends and was in London a few weeks later and, to fill in an evening, went to a performance and found I actually preferred the music in this concert version. The story line is quite close to the play and the fact that the singers are doing just that -- singing -- rather than also carrying a full stage production means they remain totally focused on the music. The follow-up reunion of various prior casts, also on the Blu-ray and I assume the DVD disc, is also worth watching many times over.
B008JFUR10|5.0|great price for a great movie get it worth it dvd plus blueray and the ultra violet which you can give to anyone you know
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|The acting and scenes are well done. Unfortunately, the rapid clips becomes extremely distracting and sometimes the visual reality takes away from the idea that this was meant to be a stage play where reality is somewhat set aside. I find the 25th anniversary concert performance at O2 in London, also available on disc and Blu-ray, far more enjoyable for watching and listening.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|great movie for a great price and it was worth it 3 different versions for a low price . . .
B0083P1QUM|5.0|It always amazes me how an author manages to find new & different ideas to keep the reader from getting tired of a series that has  been around for awhile; but Cornwell has again outdone herself!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Not bad for passing time. Cute and entertaining game for a range of age groups to enjoy. Not a huge rip off like many of these types of games can be a times.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much...Will watch it again and again.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes action and a good story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am numb from the  words on these pages. I won't be going to the basement without thinking of Liesel.
B00GB7GX20|5.0|I originally purchased the single Loved Me Back to LIfe.. I took a chance and purchased the whole cd, when it was on sale. I love every song. Celine Dion is as great as ever.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I received this really quickly, which was great, since my original cable had disappeared and replacement ones I had were not charging my Kindle.  This one worked perfectly and my Kindle is now fully charged.
B00FEN000S|4.0|It has Charlie Hunnam in it!  I would watch anything with him in it!  Dem Abs.  Ladies you'll love it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Awesome. Has all the right things combined into it love it<br />. Read this book now please!! I can't believe I read this in like 2 hours
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love catching fire going to see movie tomorrow loved the book it was the best book I ever read
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Sycamore Road was an easy to read, enjoyable story. I wouldn't go so far as to say, un-put-down-able, but it was entertaining and included some of the key characters from &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;, which I enjoyed. It would make a good movie, in the same way as its predecessor.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I give it four stars for its character development and the plots twist and turns. At times a bit slow and predictable. The last third of the book is the best part.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie. I didn't know too much about it prior to watching it, but feel that I've learned quite a bit about a major incident that took place that our country was involved in.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Best Bond in years. Daniel Craig finally owns the role. The teaming with Sam Mendez was one of those magic moments that saved the franchise.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Who doesn't like the newer batman series. I recommend it, but don't know what else to say about it. I have to have so many words for a review.
B004I744AS|5.0|Dictionary so much more than dictionary.  I especially appreciate the power of practicing the use of words as well as info regarding various subjects that increase my knowledge around the world and through various time periods.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It was a good movie, and I was able to get this Blu Ray through amazons lightening deals on black Friday for $2
B0063IH60K|5.0|This relieves all stress that could come when waiting especially at the doctor's office quietly suppressing all interference from others.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Fight club is a classic. It's a great movie although I should not be speaking of it, the first rule of fight club is to not talk about fight club.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like spider solitaire because it expands the regular playing solitaire and brings a little more complexity to the game.
B000O78KW4|5.0|Great movie. I recommend it and since I was able to get it through amazons lightening deals, it was almost free
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good go to game for keeping me awake in the middle of the night with the baby. Easy and fun with increasing difficulty.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I'm stuck, so I am only giving 4 stars. It's hard to stop playing, at least until you get stuck!
B001EBWING|5.0|I'm over forty and I've finally seen this movie. What the heck was I waiting for? I'm glad my husband talked me into getting it.
0060245867|5.0|This story is charming for young children and sure to delight.  My students always enjoyed hearing it read to them or reading it.  I think it's valuable as it teaches you that caring for others is work.  Like the child cares or the mouse, they realize their parents care for them and it's not always easy.  So, it teaches them to be grateful for what adults do for them.  It can spin off into talking about what they can do for adults to make their day brighter, or load easier. You can discuss how to be thoughtful.  Or discuss caring for the pets they have at home.  It's a fun book with upbeat illustration.  A child-pleaser for sure.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Excellent quality blu ray discs, excellent sound and is one of the most famous films of Sylvester Stallone. It worths every cent.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|I thought it delved into interesting aspects of his character but the film also had a lot of holes. Overall, entertaining though.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|If you like Pink Floyd you must have it. Excellent quality CD and the songs are the best of the band.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There were some weird things in the book. And I have no idea what will happen. Wish I knew if peeta died or not.
1419702238|4.0|I don't like it, but my son loves it. He is a cautious reader, very shy of reading challenging books. He has read every volume of this series many times over.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It has very good definitions for kids and adults. It's a very good dictionary to read! Hope you enjoy it.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Not much play time to date, but from what I have experienced the sound quality is great, the construction is comfortable and sturdy and the price is right.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I show this video on all the wrong things that can happen when you buy a house. It keeps their interest and they love it.
B000QUCPWU|4.0|Steve Cropper's guitar is good; Booker T's keys are clean; all the fella's  of Booker T and the MG's music is consistent, and steady. Less is sometimes more, and its true here. Booker T and the MG's made this sub-genre in the United States; the Shadows did in England. But Booker T and the MG's are unique in their subtle, laidback, restrained musicianship; steady and clean. Listening to 'Green Onions' and comparing it to Roy Buchanan's version, I remember Booker T and the MG's put this version out several years before. Steve Cropper is a link between those versions. It's a good song and both versions are excellent, as are all the songs on this recording. Steady and clean.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Good example of what really goes into our food processing and why we should pay attention to what we eat.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|This album was so worth the buy.  Ms. Perry has made an album that has songs that sound a lot like her previous winners, but has added some very beautiful, soulful ballads.  This album is proof that she is not only growing up, but she is not stuck in the bubblegum mode either.  It is an album worth listening to again and again.  I never thought I would ever think that of her, but she has totally impressed me with this one.  As others have noted, she has shown a maturity in not only the album design but totally with the album content.
B00005QGAV|4.0|'Jam', 'Black and White' (the smash hit on the album), and 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me' are catchy songs with the electric guitar throughtout and express concerns and issues in our society.<br /><br />'In the Closet', 'Remember the Time', 'She Drive Me Wild', and 'Can't Let Her Get Away' are songs about Romance and captures Michael's romantic side.<br /><br />'Heal the World', 'Will You Be There', 'Keep the Faith', and the tribue song to the late Ryan White are all beautiful and Special ballads on the album.<br /><br />'Who is it' is a very dramatic song with a eerly and etheral intro and captures Michael's ability to convey emotions.<br /><br />'Give in to Me' and the albums title track (along with 'In the Closet) are senual and speak about love-and lust.<br /><br />The album has New-Jack Swing and thanks to the help of Teddy Riley, it is another hit album for the King of Pop.
B000001FYL|5.0|I have always lliked Jon Bon Jovi music.  I own many more of his albums/CDs.  Price was reasonable. and arrived in good shape.
B00G70JQZC|5.0|the acting, history and story was amazing! Great effects, but not over done and realistic. Directing good. They keep following the comic stories. Two thumbs up for this!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Was unsure how Matt Smith would be as The Doctor after the perfect David Tennant.  He's an outstanding next best choice.  Amy Pond is one of my favorite assistants.  The season does an excellent job of pushing the Doctor Who story further with a season full of interwoven stories.
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|Stayed true to story, great acting, funny at times and characters grew with each movie. Action was great! A little too long during the scene down the runway. One hour to travel down a runway, yea right not so realistic. Everything else realistic and creative
B005H9B44A|4.0|Very good but slower than the other Marvel movies.  Perfectly sets the stage for Thor's role in THE AVENGERS.  Needed for the much better Thor 2.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|If you have seen the Movie Tailor then you have pretty much seen the funniest parts of the movie.  The rest of the film is just filler for the stuff you see in the tailor.  Jennifer comes off as bored in the movie,  the young kid that plays the son has the best lines but all of them are in the movie trailor.
B003G94BZC|5.0|It took a little while for Matt Smith to find his footing but he's very good in the end.  Amy Pond is brilliant!
0307895475|5.0|This is a must for the game! There's just too much involved with the game to not buy this and use it every time you play. After a couple weeks we got the hang and didnt need it as much. Love the extra they threw in here like for alchemy. It made it very useful to brew new potions
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham owes me yet another night's sleep. This well written story shows us once again what a great story teller he is. He has the ability to paint his characters so well into your mind, that when the book is finished you miss the friends you've left inside the covers. A glimpse into how far we've come with race relations and how much farther we still have to go.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game Ever but it could use a few updates<br />Other than that it is very fun B b b b b
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is enjoyable and I was totally hooked from the get go.  As soon as I am done with this favorable review I am on to the next of the series. Thank you Hugh howey for sharing this wonderful original saga. Read it people you won't regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This was an interesting experience, as I enjoyed the first two books at the outset of my reading of the third. As I read through the book the lack of depth in the characters became apparent. Katniss rarely is challenged in a thoughtful way and generally elects the very emotional rudimentary decisions. When she does to against the grain there is little insight into why decisions have been made this way. The degree to which this is the case only served to reveal the pattern that had been established in the first two books,<br /><br />It was quite difficult to slog through this installment, though it does pickup towards the end when an action packed plot takes over, allowing the author to settle back into her strengths. The ending isn't particularly inspiring, and the epilogue seems entirely unnecessary. If you have read the first two, and are on the fence in terms of completing the series, I recommend that you abstain and take on a new adventure.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Have not used ours yet but have seen friends use theirs and the like it. Good deal too when I got it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This isn't an action story, this is a human story. While the first half shows the process of becoming a SEAL, Luttrell' s story of his team is deeply personal and heartfelt. It is an excellent tribute to the men who sacrifice everything for their country.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Was a good deal when I got it. Good movie. Arrived on time and packaged well. Blue ray is the way to go.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|An extremely disappointing experiment in realism, Zero Dark Thirty is so focused on pounding out the facts that it loses sight of what good movies are supposed to have; namely, interesting characters and an emotional payoff. If I wanted to find out &#34;what really happened,&#34; I would have gone to Wikipedia, not a theater.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing<br /><br />Beautiful graphics awesome idea with great power ups. Definitley good game. Will recomend to other game fanatics and play a lot
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app can be slow at times, but it is mostly fast. Thanks, I guess, to who ever made it. I'm not sure what to say because there's a 20 word minimum. Thanks! Bye :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good<br />Really fun you have to get it I am giving it 5 stars get it get it<br />Get it
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is the best game ever made I love the clothes and the boyfriends the give you gifts !
B004GYY714|4.0|My number 1 app in all platforms. Every member of my family uses and we have different folders by user, genre and country.<br /><br />We've used it for long and only wish they allowed us to manage the radio station folders mentioned above up and down to our desired order; it would be so easy for tunein to allow this. It already happens for the contents of each folder (the stations or podcasts) but they are a bit stubborn about listening to their loyal subscribers to let us organize station folders. Maybe one of their decision makers will read this, or like most other technology firms they will simply ignore it not realizing that the voice of one client/user represents that of thousands.<br /><br />It would be cool if they allowed for further screen customization but that may be too much to ask. Maybe Amazon, Google or Apple buys TuneIn someday and make the great app better even. Sign up for an account and see your favorites (in folders or not) mirrored in any platform you sign in.<br /><br />TuneIn please allow folder order management soon!<br /><br />ps TuneIn Pro was $1.99 in Apple Store, not sure why $7 in Android.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good way to pass time and use your mind. Works smooth on kindle fire HD. Thanks for the fun game
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is so fun I can not stop playing it. Also you can get stuff .for if you have on PlayStation or Xbox for your. Characters.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I absolutely love this game! It's a lot of fun. When I start playing it I can't ever put it down. The one thing I would like to see added is an arrow key pad, strictly as an option in the settings. I suggest this cuz I get upset when I roll my finger over the screen in a certain direction and my minion does the exact opposite of what my finger did. I know not everyone will or does have this problem but I think an arrow key pad being added and available for an option, such as the sound setting, would allow me to enjoy this game even more.
1594202842|5.0|Innocently hilarious! An vivid and honest description of a  mother's intellectual dilemma in an ever increasingly anti-intelligence society.  Interestingly it has nothing to do with the author's cultural background. It could be a permanent struggle of any mother from any cultural or racial background in US.
0345803485|4.0|It was a captivating book.  There is too much explicit sex, at all times, in it.  Some of it could have been left to the imagination.  However it was a good, fast read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome Notch I'd great for making it and moaning is a heart sponsor I really prefer mine craft I never had any glitches or anything there isn't any bugs I just can't wait for the 0.8.0 update to come out and I prefer to download it on a device with a big screen like an iPad or kindle fire<br />But other than that this game is awesome
0345803493|4.0|Great follow up to a good book.  It is predictable however still charming and becomes allot more thrilling leading to yet another book.  Enjoyable.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|Another great directed film by Nocole Conn. Characters are memorable, giving an extremely well acted performance. Once Elena (Necar Zadegan) meets Payton (Traci Dinwiddie), she find it extremely difficult to think of anyone else. She then begins to question the marriage she has been in for so many years and why it is on a number of different levels not working at all and falling apart. Payton, following a relationship of 10 years, feels like her heart really is not open to any new relationships, until she meets and slowly against her will fall in love with Elena.
0316204366|5.0|The first story, &#34;David and Goliath&#34; grabbed my attention and kept it.  I must have read Mr. Gladwell's take on it no less than three times before I started telling anyone who came into my circle about this new perspective on an old story and sometimes reading it to them.  This first chapter alone should be required reading for all ministers of all faiths! What I loved about this book is that it shows how one's disadvantages can become one's asset if one does not dwell in self-pity too long and looks for an alternative way to achieve one's goals. I have a couple of relatives with which I will be sharing this book.
B00000J048|3.0|Good concept, difficult design.  I bought these for my three year old.  Maybe he's a bit young but he was definitely interested. The problem is that the white base platform doesn't lock or click together.  They more or less slide into place.  So, when the kiddo wants to pick it up, it's kind of like picking up a soft puzzle and carrying it - doesn't work.  It frustrated him and he started to cry when it wouldn't stay together.<br />Possible solution is to glue it to a hard surface (some kind of board) and keep it in a specific orientation.  That's not its design, but for our purposes, that's about what we will need to do to enjoy them.  the gears will all spin each other and he really did like that.
B000SEI230|5.0|Excellent read.  Sometimes a good person comes along and can have an effect on another person.  I loved these characters.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Well written. A very powerful story told through the eyes of a young boy. How the holocaust affected an innocent child.
0316055433|2.0|Donna Tartt, a beautiful and intelligent writer, wasted her time and mine on the boring druggie Theodore Dekker and his low-life friend Boris.  The first part of the novel was excellent:  interesting and fast-paced.  After that, it was all downhill.  I couldn't finish the book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I amaddicted to candy crush and my Kindle! I thought Amazon would never let me have both. I do get frustrated on the levels that you only get past because of dumb luck and takes weeks to luck knot passing. Other than that is a great game!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Frustrating and fun.  Simple yet strategic. Love this app.  It's extremely addictive, especially when you are on a tough level
B0014O1ODS|1.0|This is not a biography.  It is an exceptionally poorly written novel loosely based on the life of Rodin.  The author has a limited store of adjectives which are drawn on continuously.
B0064W65SO|5.0|Very enjoyable story with origins on Batman, Gordon, and Catwoman. The artwork isn't the best but its not bad either. My only gripe is that its sometimes hard to read on a Kindle Fire HD due to limited panel zoom and no landscape mode but i cannot fault the book for that. That is something i hope Kindle can iron out someday.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Classic!  Timeless! A truly wonderful story! This story is a staple in our house at Christmas time. It is a wonderful lesson for life.
B00005JPMZ|4.0|The Ninja Turtles are back in their first CGI film. The turtles do look amazing in CGI. Imagi Animation Studios did an incredible job with the artwork. The textures and lighting look great.<br /><br />The plot of the movie has some nice character moments, but ultimately isn't as strong as the aesthetics. There's something about an ancient warlord who is capturing monsters to rule the world. For the turtles' first CGI movie, I actually think it might have been better to stick with something more traditional, like Shredder threatening to take over the world or something like that. However, the film is littered with wonderful moments. I love the setup, in which Leonardo has left to go on a spiritual retreat and the other turtles are lost without him. It makes for some nice tension. I think the movie captures the sense of brotherhood between the turtles better than any other movie or TV show thus far.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely worth watching if you're a TMNT fan. The story could have been better, but in the turtles have never looked better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An awesome original game. Provides hours of entertainment. The best part is the price. Very addicting however. I could play for hours.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|the I vast amount of unnecessary crudity.  I bought this primarily for historic value, as sitting President Obama and Mrs Clinton both appeared in it.  The movie treats political correctness in a manner reminiscent of Blazing Saddles, and with roughly an equal number of laughs.There is a big difference however; between a story that contains some crude moments - and a story that might have been written around crude moments.  Does contain a bit of HARDCORE political satire, but even that is not worth the obsession with human bowel movements etc.  I give it one star for GUTS: Making fun of big oil AND the recently deceased dictator of North Korea (the only country in recent history that has publicly threatened to  launch nuclear tipped missiles at the United States) DOES display a lot of guts.  (or a lack of brains)<br /><br />Oh, this review is based on the version seen in theaters - I cannot imagine what is on the Banned & Unrated Version.  Yuck.
B00CXAAG6I|3.0|This is a cute book. I got a few chuckles out of it and will have my cat lover friend read it when I see her at Christmas.
0425261360|1.0|Dear Ms. Cornwell:   You have asked me to explain to you why you received a failing grade in &#34;Detective Fiction Writing 101&#34;. The major reason was the terrible story &#34;Bone Bed&#34; that you submitted as your final project. The work was an ill conceived mess with poor plot, logic, characterization and dialogue.   Regarding the plot, you started well enough with an interesting problem of the body in the water. But that got badly lost in an amorphous mess of tangents with minor characters that were of little importance to the major plot line. The endless squabbles between your main character Scarpetta and nearly everyone she comes into contact with were annoying and contributed nothing to the story except confusion. The squabbles between Scarpetta and her husband were especially annoying and almost totally irrelevant and yet they continued to get in the way of the story, especially toward the end.   Speaking of the end, it was obvious you had no idea how to solve the mystery and end the story based on any internal logic of the plot. Rather, at the end you simply brought back an obscure and unimportant character you'd mentioned a few times toward the start of the book, made him the killer and ended it. There was no explanation at all of why the killer did what he did nor how he did it. How, for example, did he get to northern Canada? I get the strong feeling that you couldn't finish the story by the time it was due and wrote the ending you did in desperation. I see that frequently in writers with more ego than talent.   Your dialogue is badly written and poorly organized. Far too often the dialogue will jump from topic to topic for no apparent reason. This serves only to confuse and annoy the reader. Also far too often you use pronouns for which there is no reference and the readers is left wondering to whom you meant to refer. For example, on  page 452 (paperback version) we read:    Missing??? Then why is she outside calling it&#34;  Just who &#34;she&#34;refers to here is far from clear. The reader has to puzzle it out. Later, (p. 464) you write &#34;She materialized out of flashing bright lights...&#34;. Just who &#34;she&#34; is isn't clear for almost a page and then &#34;she&#34; turns out to be someone rather unimportant. Yet until that is made clear the reader is wondering just who this presumably important new character is. After all, she must be important if she's being introduced with all this mystery. And at the end of the first paragraph on that page you get all cute and obscure by saying &#34;&#34;I don't know her and I do&#34;. Come on, Cornwell, enough with the high school level attempts to be &#34;deep&#34; by being obscure.   In summary, I suggest that you give up any hopes of being a successful writer of suspense fiction. The only way a piece of mismash like Bone Bed could be published would be if you were an established writer with a history of good books behind you who had gotten lazy, careless and sloppy and intimidated editors.
1476727651|5.0|This book was awesome!  So exciting I found myself reading far into the night to finish just one more chapter.  I love how SK dealt with the boy Danny all grown up.  It was very believable and very intense.  In the end, good triumphed over evil, and Rose the Hat was vanquished!  I am so glad because I really grew to hate that character lol.<br />Read this book!  You will be happy you did!<br />SK is the BEST!!!!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is a really fun game,  its a good way to pass the time. can u please make loralei easier to get
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love the story line and the actors, the ending indicates the story should be continued. I love the fact that the producers are keeping the same actors. Chris Hemsworth is a hunk! They can keep making the Thor movies forever and I'll watch all of them
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is really great game, monkeys against balloons and all. But they should explain why monkeys are against balloons though. Upgrading, buying, leveling up. It is really fun destroying balloons. There is a computer version too if you prefer it on computers. There is also btd 4 hacked and you get $999999999999. Well I forgot the how much money in the HACKED version, but check it out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'd recommend this book to every one. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie when it comes out. It should be an &#34;adults only&#34; rating. Hot and spicy, but well written. I've read all three and enjoyed them immensely.
B007V508CC|5.0|They can sing !!!  Pedictably Maroon 5 ... GREAT sound and will keep you on your toes !!!  Great tunes for driving a distance !!  It does &#34;  get- it- on &#34;  !!!
B00F2362IE|1.0|It takes up your kindle space, so you have to erase everything!!! Do not buy!!! Even though it's free,it, it takes forever to load!!! Waste of time.......
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading more stories from this wonderful Aussie writer.  Highly recommended!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|The only reason I gave one star is because I had to .This game requires you to buy items to finish goals or buildings, I am fed up with this. I can't finish the goals with out it. Unless you have REAL money to spend Do not waist your time. I'm about to delete the game tired of having to spend cash.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I downloaded this game last year and it was great. Then last month I downloaded the update now every time I try to play the game freezes and then a crashes. I tried uninstalling then reloading and it still won't work. I'm so disappointed.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|wow awesome game just 1 promblem when I finish a level it kicks me off and I have to go back on but instead of that the game is awesome I love it and highly recommend it I give it 5 stars
B000XUBFE2|5.0|only the strong of heart need read here.  you will be forever moved and the characters come out to you and become familiar in a way that leaves you understanding their suffering and pain.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good<br />This book kept me turning pages to the very end !<br />This is so the greatest book ever I loved it!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. I thought it was very well done and made me think about the positive and negative qualities in all of us. Each book had something completely new to offer and evolved the story to explain everything.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|The story line is unbelievable...not credible...one individual CIA's dogged efforts resulted in finding OBL?  Really?<br />The only part I liked was the rapid-fire dialog that expected you to know what ISI, KSM, and many other acronyms stood for.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was unique and kept me intrigued. The movie was good too. They changed it some to fit into two hours but did not compromise the integrity of the book.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This game is very cool because I have a cat but he lives at my grandmas so this way I can play this game and not miss taking care of my cat!
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|This short, easy to read and understand guide is an inspiration which shows just how simple it can be to turn your life around.<br /><br />At no point does this book try and tell you what kind of person you should be, it doesn't thrust unachievable targets at you. Instead it uses good, clear advice and examples of aspects of your life which you can influence for the better.<br /><br />Definitely a must-read for those who are dissatisfied with their lot.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|First I love the Author, The book was one I could not put down. It also made you think of the racism in the south in the 1980's, which really is not that long ago. Just like how he writes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Slow beginning, but the action and conclusion are worth it. It's great when a story line isn't predictable and happily ever after.
B004XVMCPI|4.0|Great movie, tons of fun,  Original take on the typical kung-fu action flick with a lot of clever charm.  Highly recommended.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I find this one of the most hilarious films ever. For those of us who have played a bit with drugs, it is BRILLIANT..bringing somewhat victorian standards that still exist  in England to the forefront.
B000QGEB12|4.0|Awesome movie, highly recommended if you like comedy, action with a bit of musicals and romance mixed in.  I really loved how the greatest warriors in the movies all look like Chinese trailer park denizens lol
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game will make you crazy but it is so much fun you can't stop. Just when I think there's no solution I find it. It's tough enough to be challenging but not so hard to do that you give up.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  The casting department picked the perfect actors to play the roles.  Even though the movie was slightly different than the book, it was executed awesomely.  I have watched this movie on DVD numerous times.  It never seems to get old.  I truly wish that when I was in high school, I had friends like these to help me into the transition.  This is one of the few movies that made me tear up a little toward the end.  I absolutely loved the characters the way they were portrayed, and the story was truly heartwarming.  (OK, Yes, I am a guy.)
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Pretty fun game to play with friends mainly to hard to use on a cell phone but on tablet it works well
1594135851|5.0|After reading &#34;The Hunger Games,&#34; there was no way I would pass up the opportunity to read the second installment.  This book was also great, especially the part about Katniss dealing with the changes in her life after the 74th Hunger Games.  Overall, it kept me engrossed and had a surprising ending which made me definitely have to read the third installment.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I pray that the Holocaust is never forgotten.  What a wonderful story to come out of such a tragic and dark  period in the 20th century.  I know there are young people that do not believe the Holocaust ever happened; God help us from history repeating itself.
159413586X|4.0|The last installment of the trilogy was exciting and enthralling, but was slightly lacking, compared to the two previous installments.  Even Katniss did some things that surprised me this time around.  This installment became a war story that I was not expecting, with a lot more mutts and some sad losses in life and love.  However, the series could not be about children killing each other, and this installment concluded the series very well.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|I am a sucker for stories based on true events, especially when horses are involved.  What magnificent animals. The story is well done and exciting every time I watch it.
0439023521|5.0|By far, this is the best of the three book series.  Following the adventures of Katniss Everdeen kept me spellbound and I could not put the book down.  This is one of the most captivating books I have read in many years.  The movie inspired me to read the books, and this book did not disappoint me.  I gave up reading fiction several years ago, but I am glad I reconsidered for this book.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I like this app a lot and it's a great time passer and you get 10 hints. I would recommend this app.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|this game is boring its just a waste of storage on your device i deleted it after 2 minutes do not download this app and absolutly dont spend any money &gt;:(
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great product plagued by horrible software and unclear support. Skip to the bottom if you have non logitech gear because you need to be warned. The software for the headset disables other brands peripherals like my Razer mouse and keyboard.<br /><br />Honestly this headset is great. Far superior to my Razer Chimaera I inevitably returned in pretty much every single way.<br /><br />First off the sound quality, once you get the 7.1 working, is superb. It's not as surround sound-y as it could be but it's still great. Bass is average but the audio is very clear and the noise canceling ear cups work fine. For immersive gaming it sounds very real. I personally use it with my Oculus Rift and it creates a extremely vivid experience together.<br /><br />Second off the wireless is quite surprising. With my Razer headset I could not leave my room without it dropping. With these I can walk all over my house and it only drops when I go down the stairs on the opposite side of the house from my room, which then the signal comes back when I get down stairs. Battery life is good but drains faster than I'd like even when turned off. Not a huge deal since I take them off next to the charger anyway and just plug them in when not in use.<br /><br />Next up is comfort. They are big enough to fit my larger than average head fine without being too tight or giving a headache after an extended period of time. The cushioned band is great and the ear pieces are big enough to fit over the ear completely and padded enough to feel nice without crushing the ears.<br /><br />The hardware itself is fine. The mic sounds good my friends say, the volume thing works but is does not stop scrolling at max and min so it's hard to tell, and  few programmable keys that I never use except for listening to music. Only flaw here is that the headphones themselves are creaky when the shift and move on your head which is amplified by the noise deadening ear cups.<br /><br />Finally the one flaw: the software. First off if you have a keyboard or mouse who are not logitech and you install the software for the headset it will disable them. I use a Razer keyboard and mouse and had to resort to booting into safe mode and using system restore.<br />They do not release the software separately but as a bundle that, whether you use a logitech mouse or keyboard, forces the installation of their overwriting drivers. It even claims to be detecting your hardware when installing...<br />They are aware of the issue and have not fixed it after over a year, and do not seem to feel the blame is on them but the other companies.<br />The only way to even get them working together is by installing an older version of the software which has several bugs, including crashing and disabling of 7.1 surround sound. Overall it works fine but very displeased.<br /><br />If anyone needs that software I can find the link again. It took some time to find it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|When I saw that this was in the app store for free I instantly got it.  this game is too amazing to pass the offer ogle if you miss the sale its still an amazing game. BUY IT!!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to a good friend of mine. There was nothing in the book that I didn't like. The ending was so good I almost started crying! The way how the enchantress was described
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I liked it, it wasn't a page turner you can't wait to finish but enough to keep you coming back.
B00640UICA|5.0|This is a cute but challenging game. I think I play it as much for the adorable sound effects as I do for the challenge itself. It's not too hard but can make you think. Different levels have different types of characters, each of which has a different quality that affects game play. It's relaxing while not being mindless and again, the sound effect you get when you join hands is very pleasant.
B002I0J5FG|2.0|This game is just a little too difficult to have fun while you are playing. The art looks really nice but I was really frustrated.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love it. Great book club read!<br />I really enjoy how the author goes back and forth between the lives of the characters who end up being<br />tied together some how.
B00000ADG2|5.0|For anyone who really loves Lauryn Hill, don't miss out on this album. Hands down still the Queen of rap, in my opinion and one of the greatest rap albums ever.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|kurt and company in top form. from the opening song to the closing song this concert is pure energy. the band is so tight. i'm 52 years young and alot of my friends don't like nirvana. that's there problem. this is a long dvd also. you really get your moneys worth. if you like nirvana,this is a goody. enjoy/peace
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Mind gripping from beginning to end. Brought the beauty, pain, and suffering of the times in such a eye opening reality. Very much enjoyed.
B00CZAYLS0|5.0|this is one of my favorite rock n roll albums. the new packaging is cool. the remaster kicks butt. i got the double vinyl copy. it was fun to hear the original peace album. at first i was unsure but after a few listens i really like it. my klipsch speakers were rockin' the block. order a copy for yourself today. enjoy/peace
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|The plot is simple enough: a trio of explorers discover an underground realm and they encounter different creatures and plants and terrifying obstacles. The story is nothing to ponder about: there's nothing philosophical or symbolic about it. But it's not trying to make a statement (or trying to be pretentious) about it. Journey to the Center of the Earth is strictly an adventure movie. The characters may be wooden, and the situations may be extremely preposterous, but hey, I did enjoy watching this movie. The special effects looked riveting, though watching it in 2D may have been a very minimal experience compared to the 3D that I could have seen. Still, the effects are marvelous. I did have a problem with the world underneath the earth's surface. The landscapes and creatures looked beautiful, but there weren't a lot of threatening beasts. There were sea creatures, Venus flytraps, and one T-rex: it didn't seem enough.<br /><br />Anyway, JTTCOTE is a good adventure movie. The acting isn't that great, though Brendan Fraser gives his usual enjoyable performance. I'll say that you can watch this strictly for the visuals, the music, and cinematography. I haven't seen this movie in 3D, but I heard it's better than watching it in 2D. I can't really say myself, but I guess either way is fine.<br /><br />Grade: 7.2 out of 10
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show! Very fun to watch.  Oh for the days when life was like this .... If you lived &#34;upstairs of course&#34;!!!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I literally could not put this book down! It kept me on the edge of my seat. Loved it! Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Passes time and very addictive... love it!!!!!<br />Had a blast beating all the levels, had to get three stars on all
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 7 yr old loved this game. Plays it constantly. I think its good for her, it helps develop eye hand coordination and teaches her to be alert! Its cute too!
B00CJGP116|5.0|Marc does not disappoint! I LOVE this newest CD, it has great ballads, authentic salsa, and explosive hits! We clean, drive, and dance to this album.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit mostly due to the authors entertaining and engaging writing style and the interactive energy experiments. To a person who is familiar with the fundamental concepts presented in this book, there really isn't anything new or groundbreaking you will take away from it. Someone unfamiliar with how your thoughts and feelings can influence your life will find this book life changing. The experiments are a neat trick, they will work for you if you give them an honest effort though perhaps not in 48 hours. Most of mine took a little longer but they all eventually came through. I did find some of the stories she tells in the book a little too neat, I wouldn't doubt if she embellished or even invented some of them to help make her points.  Nonetheless the book does present  some very valuable concepts. This is a great book for someone unfamiliar with these concepts or for someone who doesn't think they are real.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|For we greedy-nothing is free. Anxious to have a puny 5 GB of storage we allow Amazon to install stuff that cannot be removed simply and cleanly. A thumb drive in your pocket might be larger and equally useful. This is the best part, thumb drives do not dispute and disrespects the ownership of your hard drive.<br /><br />After uninstalling, cloud does not open, however still pops up a screen when I start my computer. This cloud screen is more aggravating than  malware. Is this intentional or at least known to the Amazon cloud support. After some reading... my understanding: cloud technicians might help you uninstall what should not be there, however you must tracked down and  manually remove from your hard drive and registry. Why do we need to do this forensic pain in the neck work. Amazon cloud should make an uninstall to remove all the cloud crap from your hard drive.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The My Little Pony game is fun for my six year old but a bit slow in uploading to play and then downloading any upgrades.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|OK. OMG. WOW. HOLY SH$&!. OMG.<br /><br />I was a Stephen King virgin. Never read any of his books, and the only thing I knew about \\"The Shining\\" was that a little clip of the movie was used as a background for a shot of mass destruction in the movie \\"Twister\\". I figured 1000 pages would keep me occupied with something to read during my vacation downtime. So, I bought the book.<br /><br />Idiot, fool, dumbo, stooge! I realized I have been missing some very good books for many, many years. But I suppose I could also say I have discovered an entire collection of books I can now look forward to reading. Yeah. I really, really liked this book, and if you too have avoided King, then you are as much of an idiot as I was. This is an awesome story and very well told. Oh boy. So many books...so many pages to be discovered!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love that pinterest a had an app for my Kindle Fire HD. I have had zero issues with the app and highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun the minion are cut.  It coupons kid for a wile.  And it is free for everyone. :) :P
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Amazing book. Presents what might be the obvious, but in a way that you reassess your own goals. After reading this book I completely rewrote the goals for my team for 2013. Reducing from 20 objective to 5 business aligned goals. Goals which the team achieved and are hailed as a tremendous success - thank you Gene Kim.
B00FMZ22CM|1.0|I regret badly to had bought this app.  Doesn't work.  Very bad app. And it's expensive for its inability to function. Bad, bad, bad and bad.
B00CZ7OC46|4.0|Loved this - great to take your head out of the workplace for some inspiration. Certainly some lessons here to be applied to build flexible and motivated teams.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This game Is the best. Is only missing raven (teen titans) and if she's added, def. 5 stars!!!!!!<br />Best game on kindle
B0026OR2PE|3.0|Having first read &#34;A year without pants&#34; by Scott Berkun, I could not give this the same rating. A though provoking book, but just as it gains momentum I though it left one handing. Regardless, working for a company who wants to be seen an innovative, the lessons & myths in this book ring true to my own work life.
B00GINENG0|4.0|Better than a real kitten and cuter. A must to add to your collection of talking friends. I love it as much as my grandson
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This novel reminded me of why I have been a fan of King since age 12. It is, by far, his best publication since Everything's Eventual. If you are a fan of his early works you will enjoy this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play with the new features and am now a new comment on this site is global and Molly and Molly and Molly and Molly and Molly to play with it was a great way to play with it and Molly the first place for you to play with it was not a race against time
B00AEBB8YW|1.0|No Stars whatsoever......Its an insult to all classic movie lovers. No chemistry no magic. This is an unworthy attempt at making money? Are you serious?
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show but it locked up the app on our new Samsung Smart TV.  I had to watch it on an older TV.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was excellent.  Your emotions will run the gamut as you read this compelling story.  I chose this to read after seeing a preview to the upcoming movie.  So glad I read the book.  Always more details.  The story is a great reminder of the holocaust and the devastating affect it had on everyone.  I couldn't put it down.
B00EW79Y0O|5.0|This movie hits on all cylinders: it is funny, touching and inspiring.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|loved the series... books kept me reading but was not thrilled with the end of this one. Wish it had ended differently.
B008JFUPZI|2.0|R.I.P.D. was the illegitimate offspring of the Men In Black franchise, but lacks any of the good-natured charm of that series.  Jeff Bridges character was ridiculous rather than charming, Ryan Reynolds remains one of the least talented actors that audiences have ever been subjected to, and the remainder of the cast (including Kevin Bacon) put in lackluster and utterly forgettable performances.  The plot is, as already implied, the dead(ish) version of Men In Black's aliens, except even more predictable.  Yeah, I'll let that one set in for a moment.  There is no originality here, all the jokes fall flat, and even the special effects are really nothing to write home about.  This movie was a paint-by-numbers special-effects flick that followed every stock formula in the book.  Badly.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a good book. More difficult to read than others I have read in the past, but I still was interested in finishing it. I am glad I did. I really liked it and now I'll go and watch the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app bcuz there is so much you can buy!!!(with the coins u earn!) This game takes you traveling to places all over the world! SUPER FUN!!! ;)
B005FISC52|5.0|Great price.  My daughter loved this TV series and has enjoyed being able to watch the episodes all over again.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|You can b the dark side or the good side! That helps with getting to play more levels on a game that is free!!
055338595X|5.0|Everything one would come to expect from this Gran Maester of Fantasy fiction. While we had to wait a torturous five years after &#34;A Fast for Crows' the wait for 'A Dance with Dragons was worth it. Martin picks up right where he left off. Dany and her nearly full grown dragons have survived an epic battle as she makes her way to Westeros across the Narrow Sea from Essos to claim the Iron Throne hat she states is rightfully hers as the Targaryens were proper rulers of Westeros and the five kingdoms. Double and triple crosses abound as people change their faiths to the different houses and of course some deaths though not a shocking as depicted in the Red Wedding back in 'A Storm of Swords'. And there is one character Reek some readers maybe familiar with Cersei has learned about the death of her father Lord Tywin and suspects her brother Tyrion the Imp though he's imprisoned and she'll do anything with her twin brother Jaime's help to crush anyone that gets in her way. The book ends with a taste of what is to come with the net installment 'The Winds of Winter' and, not even Georg's publishers know hen he will turn it in. Hopefully we wont' have to wait another five years hurry up George Winter is Coming and the TV series is catching up as we wait for the concluding volume 'A Dream of Spring'.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is great but I do not like that you have to post things on facebook to accomplish goals on it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This is the worst of the Gillian Flynn novels to date. Twists in the story were slow to develop, rather than quick. For hundreds of pages it becomes semi obvious who is guilty. But, it was still a god escape from doing grad school work.
B002VX0A40|5.0|This was so cute.  My daughter loved playing with this.  I would attach it to her carrier. It would be a great gift for a baby shower.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|***minor spoilers- I tried my best not reveal say anything too major***<br /><br />There is no doubt that I love this series.<br />I finished both Divergent and Insurgent in the course of one day. I pre-ordered my copy of Allegiant. I'm excited for the movies. I can't wait for the upcoming short stories featuring Tobias.<br />I fell in love with the premise, the characters, the relationships, the action- everything. Even if the books weren't perfect, I still loved them.<br /><br />So naturally, the ending completely broke my heart.<br /><br />And I have to give Veronica Roth credit for that. To create a world with characters that I felt so much for- that's the true marking of a great author. And although I'm definitely not happy with the ending, (not going to lie, I'd much rather have one with sunsets and rainbows and happily ever afters,) there was something extremely powerful and beautiful about it, and all in all, it's a fitting end for a spectacular series.<br /><br />(For bitter fans, Roth wrote a very throughout and thoughtful blog post on why she ended Allegiant the way she did, and I highly suggest that you read it once you've finished the novel. It helped curb some of my sadness/anger, anyways (haha))<br /><br />So why the three stars?<br /><br />Allegiant shifts between Tris and Tobias's perspectives, and, as many fellow reviewers have pointed out, their voices are similar. There was more than one time where I would put the book down and take a break, only to begin reading again and not be able to tell who was narrating. Roth does a much better job executing Tobias's voice in &#34;Free Four&#34; and &#34;The Transfer&#34; (both of which I highly recommend), so it's a bit disappointing that I didn't see it here.<br /><br />Furthermore, I wasn't ecstatic about what was beyond the fence, or more so, how it was presented. Especially near the middle of the book, there's a ridiculous amount of information being thrown at the reader. Given how well the premise was executed in Divergent, Allegiant's seems clumsy in contrast.<br /><br />And as usual, there's a lot of death. I understand that the world that they live in is a dangerous one, but when there are so many characters dying left and right, it detracts from the impact that /certain deaths/ could have had. To avoid spoiling anything in Allegiant, I'll just refer to Fernando in Insurgent: a minor character whose death was completely meaningless and did nothing but add another tally to the death toll. There's more of it in Allegiant. Urgh.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have already discussed my grievances, but there's a validity that comes with numbers of people agreeing on the same thing<br />.<br />That being said, I still recommend you read this book. It's painful and heartbreaking, yes, but it's also a very beautiful end to a wonderful series.<br /><br />To end with one of my favorite quotes in the series:<br />&#34;I guess a flame that burns that bright isn't meant to last.&#34;
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|This movie ended on a note so obviously full of propaganda for the current administration's free for all that I was embarrassed for the screen writer.
B00GNL251C|5.0|I love Wing Chun and it has a great story if you are not too lazy to read sub titles.......
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great movie for all ages.  My grandchildren loved it.  Storyline was good and characters were so like able.  Not much more to say.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game my daughter loves it and so do i would recommend to any one who loves .  Horses and wants or dreams of owning one
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Extremely good at what it does.  HOWEVER, it also wants to be able to access everything from your network info to what toothpaste you use.  Like most apps it takes it too far. Your call in the end but it is a solid app
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very fun game. If anything they should have a reset button. Besides that the game is awesome.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun game for days to come<br />Great for all ages, my boys love the game and have since the first ever played.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was really fun. I have such a fun time playing it. It's a lot like Temple Run. But still really fun.
1439116881|5.0|Lisa Genova is a gifted writer.  I have read all three of her published books and am eagerly awaiting the fourth.  Still Alice gives us a good idea of Alzheimers from the patient's point of view.  I think it's a &#34;must read&#34; for us all.
B00F6DLYT2|5.0|This CD is AWESOME!!  It's not often to find a CD that has a good song on every track, but I love the whole CD.
B009A87X80|5.0|Another super Eva Cassidy recording.  She is a talented artist and her recordings are superb.  We listen to her often and enjoy her every time.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|A thrilling tale that times I couldn't put down.  Just when I thought I knew where it was headed it turned and headed in a new dimension.
B007EC27QM|3.0|not much better than calculator that came on my Samsung Infuse.  If you don't have a calculator on your smart phone this is an awesome basic calculator you can add to your phone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is fun and free and amazing to play or even watch someone else to play you should get this game!!!!
B004SVM7BW|4.0|Worked easier than the quick office program that came on my phone.  Definitely easier to read and navigate PDF's on my phone.
B00GII9UCW|3.0|If you are old enough to remember the Everly Brothers you will like this album. Excellent harmonizing but all the songs sound the same and they are a little grim.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|easy to do and a good mind numb for a short time<br />fun to escape to.  wish there were more free levels with this without the hoops but all in all a good game
B008XG1X18|5.0|Explore your interests and link to the interests of other like minded people. Would have enjoyed instructions, but push button exploration works as well.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great fun to play on the phone.  Like the achievements.  Highly recommend the game.  Like the fact I can easily change backgrounds as well.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|A true comedy classic and the best of the vacation series.  This film has made&#34;Griswold&#34; a verb at our house.
B00G118LYY|5.0|I really like the game wish it had more stuff in<br />the sandbox but I love it as I do with TOCA.
B00DSGPZ12|3.0|This is a pretty fun game. It would be nice if you could fly a few more planes and have dogfights.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have been using this app regularly for quite a few months. I'ts a superb app. No complaints whatsoever. I would say it is really perfect. It has all that I need and much more. Thanks for making it available and for free. Blessings!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Well not let me link with Facebook, and sometimes freezes, causing delete and re download. But, LOVE YOUR GAME!! Please fix this bug so I can save my progress of it does freeze. Thanks!
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|Decent effort by an author trying to get back to the roots of his success. Enjoyable though not memorable read
1449410243|5.0|Hilarious! All cat owners/lovers must buy! The Oatmeal had some great content and it's nice to have this in book form.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Great book! Have only read about 20% so far! You learn so much that you were never taught in school and it is not pretty, but have the courage to learn the truth because as the saying goes, &#34;the truth will set you free&#34;!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting once you get started you can't or don't want to stop playing it for anything.
B001BR7CZW|3.0|The scene in the church with James Brown makes it a *** no matter what you think of the rest.
B0086700CM|2.0|Really fun game. However a few days into installing the app, it started moving slowly and ultimately would freeze my kindle. Very disappointed because I really love playing this game.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Okay, it was not the book. We all know that. And the movie probably earns higher marks if it came out BEFORE &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; set such a high standard. Still, if you have a lover of zombies, they will probably want this in their collection. If nothing else, they will someday be able to hearken back to when zombies were so &#34;in&#34; that Brad Pitt starred in a zombie movie.<br /><br />Honestly, the movie is simply okay. Not great, not the worst movie made. Simply okay.
B001PR0YGC|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it in the theater with three friends. I kept wishing I could just leave. My boredom was excruciating. While we were walking out, I found out everyone else felt the same. I haven't been the one to choose the movie since that fateful night.
0345536886|5.0|I love Grisham what can I say. I enjoy his interesting knowledge on many levels of society. Like all his books this one does the job of entertaining and educating the reader ..
0307271080|5.0|She did not disappoint me.  I have read all her books and cannot wait for the next one.  She is a keeper.  If you cannot stand the truth, don't pick this one up.  She is brutally honest.
0142421375|5.0|This is a fun read, light weight yet intriguing enough to rate as a page turner..  Grisham is surprisingly good at writing for young people as well as the rest of us..
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think this is a good game.  But I don't think that they should limit how many lives u have...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Was a great game couldn put it down had relly gd graphics and u just keep finishing levels so it keeps u intertained
B007TK77QE|4.0|This resonated for long after I finished it. HP is a hard act to follow but The Casual Vacancy worked for me. I loved how nearly every character had flaws and secrets. I loved the authenticity of the voices from every age and class. I hope JKR has some more adult novels in the works.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Liked the unexpected. Some logical issues but still great. Wonder why the series was cancelled on TNT?<br /><br />Couldn't locate the series for free.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game but one thing that really irritates me is the &quot;run out of tries&quot; and have to wait &amp; wait. i<br /> hate that!!! otherwise I would definitely give it a 5 star.
B00EFYAWKA|5.0|Love everything about his music. This album is different than his ones in the past(which i love, love), but has a different vibe and its cool
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|This book is like your own personal life coach!  Filled with great advice and inspiration, it is sure to help put you on the right track for a more fulfilling life and as a result greater happiness!  Highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|good book getting ready to resettle very last one. too bad it has to end. but they are great reads.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app I used to be able to chat with my friends and now it keeps saying Unable to be able to chat with your friends! DOES NOT WORK!!
1250038820|5.0|Incredible book. While not at detailed as the blog, this is such great conversation piece in any home. Brandon's work is amazing and it is always inspiring to think of all the wonderful things he does while meeting strangers and finding out their story.
B003VANOFY|2.0|After owning it for a year, the headphones start to fail quite often. They randomly turn off, even while plugged in. There is no warning that they're about to shut off and while skyping with my wife, it's becoming increasingly more frustrating. My wife hears a really loud pitched sound when I turn them back on. Before they started to fail (and even after) their sound in/out quality was good.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I chose three because it was really exciting in some parts but other parts were hard. It was very challenging but I still managed to make it. That's why I give it a three. I will play this again.
B00DZPVS9O|3.0|After reading  reviews, thought it would be more psychedelic 70s sound. Not. Have listened to this 5+ times. Their other albums more interesting.
B006S8QY8K|5.0|Just a delightful movie and full of surprises. It is not your typical man going through a mid life crisis. He actually has morals and so does his teacher. There are many laughs involved and a good time film! Rare to be entertained and have some morality to boot!
B009UVWBMA|5.0|Love the &#34;new&#34; Taylor with atitude. Over the years, I've purchased many CDs for one or two songs that I really like but dislike the rest. Taylor Swift is one of the very few young artists who produces album after album that I enjoy listening to in their entirety. She keeps on growing as a song writer and singer. I look forward to her next single or album.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|this is a very good game. keeps you interested and your mind working. I would definitely recommend this game to other people.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|Disappointed in this much anticipated album. Roar is the only one that I like on the album. Katy's music videos seem to be more entertaining which might not have translated well on audio CD.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I think this film is wonderful; it's Altman's best.  The &quot;all star cast&quot; acting is good, the one liners are funny, and the soundtrack is cool.  I think it is worth the cost and time to watch.  See more at coocanvas dot weebly dot com.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Love this long-awaited album. Definitely among her better work and fill with fun, raw emotion and attitude. Thruough her songs, you can sense Avril's big and naughty personality. Married or not, she stays true to her grunge rock root and remains my favorite artists. Be sure to get the explicit version or you won't get the true Avril experience.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|I like Jane Austen's stories.  This film is wonderfully acted, the story is good, and I thought the directing was excellent!  This film is worth it.  See more at vyctorynotes dot blogspot dot com.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|many songs aspire to be this bit of magic - but there is no mistaking that this is one that will remain in people's hearts years after other songs and memories have faded.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is just as addictive as candy crush....I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like the fact that I have to purchase coins or log onto facebook or google to get bonus coins....boo...there should be a way to replenish without purchasing.
B001NB4Z6K|5.0|This is a great album for the 80&#34;s person who just wants U2 in their collection rounds out pretty well.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|What an amaaaaaaaaaaazing movie.<br />Everyone should see it.<br />If you have seen Moulin Rouge, you will love this one.<br />It is literally an amazing movie, really charming. And it's a really good movie to see with your partner!
B00000I5Y6|5.0|This is the best bang for the buck, if you just want a little Kansas in your collection. It has pretty much all I wanted.
B001JNNDE2|4.0|What a great movie!<br />It's a classic that everyone should have. It's weird and really awkward, but that is the fun part about Napoleon Dynamite.<br />It's not the typically bullied guy, It's Napoleon (and that's the only way I can describe him!)<br />It is not necessary to have in blu ray, quality is the same as a DVD (in this movie), but for the price difference i think you should get de blu ray (as i did).<br />Great gift for movie lovers!
B00899E7VM|5.0|I am completely Jealous of the lucky bastards clapping in the audience of this recording. Those sons a bictch's saw these guys play in a way I have never heard! Chick show things no one ever did, Al is totally different than anything I've heard from him, Stanley is Stanley Clark(!) like no one else can be, And Lenny lays down a track that you can run a freight train on! Wait a minute, Is That Jean Luc Ponty! Any part of this recording Blows Me Away!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|It was definitely one of my favorite zombie movies. It has no ending and you want to see more.<br />It is a great film, non-predictable and very entertaining.<br />This 3 pack it's just perfect. For the ones who watch blu ray, can buy this pack to have the chance to see this movie (for example) in all MAC computers (which read dvd only), and de Digital copy for those boring flights everywhere in the world. Really entertaining.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Easy to use (provided you have Flash) and is a great convenience.  I've even downloaded movies as well as tunes.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Ok, first of all: If you like Disney and you collect these movies, this is a MUST in your collection.<br />Wreck-it Ralph is the typical anti-hero that makes us love him.<br />The collector's edition is a perfect match. Contains Blu ray 3-D, Blu ray, Dvd and Digital copy (all in ONE! box) and the front it's a 3D image! It's a great piece.<br />Of course, great piece for a great movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If all you use your set top box (Roku, Apple TV, Tivo, BluRay) or smartTV for is Netflix, YouTube, HBOGo, and you always have your phone on you...Then, this can replace them and be much easier and faster to use.  Plus, it makes quick 'hey check this out' moments much easier for showing those videos on YouTube.<br /><br />Yeah, it's super cheap and portable too.  Love this little thing and looking forward to new features and new apps that support it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a really good app it lets kids and adults guess words using pictures I'd play this game all day if I could!

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game. And the price is right. Free. Can't seem to put it down. Only time I do is when I have to upgrade an item and it has to be imported.

B000W022XG|5.0|This album made me feel things I never experienced before. When I heard this album, I was completely SHOCKED that this album was from 1994. It sounded like nothing I've listened to before and had such a modern feel to it. I was upset at myself for going through life for over 15 years without having experienced the music of Portishead
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|This game is awesome...you have to clap it up for gameloft, they put alot of work into this game. Only reason i gave it a 4/5 is because the game glitches sometimes. One time i was playing and jason (the main character) just froze in place, yet every thing and everyone kept moving...freaky. but besides that its great. Highly recommend recommended gor GTA fans
B00AY5B9QA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it - great melody of intertwined love stories. Hilarious scenes - and a good blend of suspense, happiness with a touch of sadness thrown in.

B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This looks like a nice game to kill time. The visuals are beautiful and it runs perfectly in my kindlefire. The in game controls are comfortable and easy to play. Anyway i am still knowing it.
B004I744AS|5.0|It is not only a good source of definitions, the pronunciations  are excellent.  We like the word games also, but the bonus features are all the interesting info and links to so many other things:  history, science, current events, and general info.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|Entertaining, beautiful, perfectly simulated. Very good graphics and a realistic performance. Actually you feel the ball hitting the flippers. I would like to have a couple of tables more to try...<br />I am playing it on the demo free version on and on again for a moth or so and it does not bore me.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Bought 2.  We used them for almost a year for Paperwhites without any issues.  We still do.  Wanted to buy another but it seems they are backordered for months.  Too bad.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game.... I'm addicted to it.. going to.get it on my tablet when my mom gets here... I'm playing on kindle now
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great gizmo and works pretty well; however it is limited to streaming only certain apps or channels from your notebook, tablet, etc. I originally thought it would reflect everything your tablet displays, i.e. every app or website. Other than this, the product is quite user-friendly. Perhaps the next generation will overcome this limitation?
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|I often wonder what retired secret service agents do in their next lives. In this book, they become private investigators with a lot of networks and influence.. If only they could have met their teenage client in a more believable manner.... oh well, it is fiction. Is it fiction that little bits of digital info, supposedly erased, can be retrieved into usable data, given the right techies?  Scary.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too complex but enough to hold your interest.  Easy on the eyes. No need to RTFM!  Enjoyable.  Some of these HO games are perplexing and you put most of you effort into simply figuring out what you are supposed to do.  This one is quite intuitive.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Because family lives in Mississippi, I was particularly interested in this book. The history, the racial tension, the wonderful humans amid the legal mess of a holographic will - all came together in a grand and sad story. Grisham took space to explain legal terms in simple language. Grisham reviewed some statistics for that geographic region. This book illustrated  what I learned as a child&#34; &#34;Where there's a will, there are relatives.&#34;
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|had to replace the one that came with my kindle fire. This is the same but since I'm charging when not in use now don't think the problem with the wires getting loose where the charger goes into the kindle will be a problem again. Replaced for free by Amazon
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|This is a good game but it doesn't compare to other racing games on Xbox yes I know this isn't an Xbox but the game is to easy it gets boring fast
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|addictive. numerous levels. I seem to like iTreeGamer games. they have generous content for free games flashy, colorful, challenging, fun
B009O2XY12|2.0|It is fun initially, but then the game keeps locking up - wanting $$ to buy things or you have to wait an hour to start again.  It is annoying.
0345525558|3.0|I can’t tell a daisy from a daffodil, and before I read The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh I didn’t know they could speak. I recall, in my youth, that florists had this motto, “Say it with flowers” but I never gave it much thought except that any old flowers you bought from them ought to be good enough to say: “Looky, I just spent all this dough on you, so it means I care.” So reading this novel has the upside for trolls like me of a take away. I learned something that just might serve me beyond a score in Trivial Pursuits.<br /><br />The author’s story is one of very damaged characters who have severe emotional problems that make it difficult for them to communicate verbally but each of them has compensated for this disability by being keenly aware of the emotions attributed to specific flowers and uses them as a substitute for verbalizing their feelings. Diffenbaugh tells her story with workmanlike prose that does not overshadow a clever, and at times brilliantly compelling plot. She offers an engaging narrative that is a quick read and that, for her, is fortunate because if given time to stop and think about the plot points and the character development one would be forced to conclude that at many spots along the way, the narrative would be thin on credulity.<br /><br />Victoria, the heroine is extremely damaged goods and is unable to communicate with others, much less engage in a normal relationship, so her story of establishing a successful floral business is quite a stretch. Her foster parent, Elizabeth, is equally troubled and tormented, and her nephew, Grant, seems to lack the full range of emotions one might expect from someone with his upbringing. Throughout the book, I wondered where his anger went, finding him the least believable. Ultimately, I was forced to conclude that Diffenbaugh’s flowers had a broader range of emotions than her characters.<br /><br />I found The Language of Flowers a fun read and consumed it in three modest sittings, I’d say it’s worth your entertainment bucks but it is not fine literature. Were it not for the knowledge to be gained from learning about the language of flowers, it would not have gotten my recommendation.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Grandson will receive this gift for Christmas.  I know he will love it because he has several other sets.<br />I got this when the price was lower so I got a bargain.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Got these for a great black friday deal. An awesome set of books. They have some maps and sketches too.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|If you are looking for a fast-paced thrilled with high octane action scenes every 2 minutes, then don't rent this movie.  While this movie has some nice action scenes, the main point of this story is the telling of an actual story. If you enjoy a movie with some substance then this is a great pick.<br /><br />The characters in the film are very compelling and they draw you into the story nicely. The action sequences are equally as exciting (though slightly predictable) and add a nice element to the film, but they are not the whole point.  It is battle or the conflict between seeing the world in ideals and being faced with the reality of life.  It is harsh and it is moving and it is the struggle of a young boy to do what he feels is right and stay true to his ideals in a world that is challenging and less than ideal.<br /><br />The filmography was also wonderfully done and they did a great job of capturing the essence of the region being portrayed.
B0018RFLQ2|4.0|Good acting and a decent plot. A great movie if you are into chess. All-in-all a good one time watch.
B0026772N8|4.0|It is a good book but it does get hard to follow at times, seems like a book you need to read more then once.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This book is so good I don't know where to begin. I'm writing on a tablet so I'll keep it brief. This is the sort of sci fi where mysterious events occur and you spend the book unraveling various secrets. It's also quite philosophical. In other words, Star Wars or Dune it ain't (not that those aren't good too). I came to it because I loved Rendezvous with Rama, but it is even better. Really there's no way to describe what's so good about this book. When I read the description I was only mildly interested. Just give it 20 pages and I guarantee you'll be hooked. It doesn't go where you expect either. It just keeps taking ever more crazy and wonderful turns.
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|I'll be honest. 2011's Fast Five didn't quite grab me the way it did most critics and fans. Everyone was raving about how that seminal chapter in the Fast in Furious series had changed the game. The series was no longer a car fetish showcase, instead the fifth installment transformed Toretto and O'Conner's team of car enthusiasts into a full blown professional heist team. It was a fine film, sure, but it didn't quite blow me away like it did everyone else. Something was missing to me.<br /><br />Enter Fast and Furious 6, or \\"Furious 6\\". This was, for all intents and purposes, intended to be the grand finale of the Fast franchise and it definitely shows as director Justin Lin goes all out in what is one of the biggest, loudest, and most fun action films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Simply put, this film has it all. Awesome action set pieces, beautiful cinematography, cool cars, plot twists and turns, and most of all, lovable, memorable characters that you really care and root for. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are accompanied by a wonderful diverse cast who never lets you forget that what the Fast movies are really, truly about: family. Without this crucial ingredient this would be just another by-the-numbers action flick. Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster,Sung Kang - the entire cast of this film deserve the utmost accolades for truly bringing this story alive. The moments where this film shines the brightest are when the crew is together and acting as a unit- a family.<br /><br />Its truly evident that director Justin Lin went for broke in this, Everything he has done with the Fast franchise has been leading up to this film. If this were the final installment it would be a damn fine way to go out, but alas this is Hollywood and the Fast films are gaining traction like never before, critically and commercially.<br /><br />I have not seen the first 4 installments, but after seeing this one I am incredibly eager to delveinto this story from the beginning. Next year brings us Fast 7 and if the the mid credits scene is any indication (yes, people, there is an AWESOME tease during the credits) then we are in for an absolute treat for the 7th chapter in the high octane story of Dom Toretto and Brian O' Conner.<br /><br />But, until then, all roads do indeed lead to Six.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|A story, a philosophy, a way of life as shared through the characters Ayn Rand created and sent into the world.  While not the impact of Atlas Shrugged, this prequel of sorts lays many of the tenants of Objectivism for the foundation of novels to come.  Engrossing and provocative are words that I feel most comfortable with when describing this work.
B0042EJD8A|2.0|The documentary is very good, but we never could view it all the way through on the disc I received.  It stopped playing at about the 12th section, and would go no further.  We tried it on various players.  We ended up seeing the documentary on a friend's DVD.<br />The disc it self was very worn.

Two thumbs up and two big toes for the win.

0553108034|5.0|A Clash of Kings is a wonderful book that surpasses its predecessor. It continues the legacy of the wonderful characters, the wonderful settings, and the corrupted story line that made A Game of Thrones so good. You will not want to put it down until the very end.<br /><br />The story starts picks up where it left off in A Game of Thrones. The Seven Kingdoms are at war, and their are more kings in the land than there have ever been. The stories of Arya, Catelyn, Tyrion and Bran continue unabated and become even more twisted. The different threads and plots from the first book make reappear in this book and are brought to full fruition. But even still, George R.R. Martin creates more questions and secrets than he does answers.<br /><br />The characters are put into increasingly tense situations and I learned a whole lot more about them. Every character has a bit of good in them and a bit of evilness in them. This really makes the characters more realistic than others in different books who are either completely good or completely evil.<br /><br />Different settings and regions make their first appearance in A Clash of Kings. These new places are all unique and are really well explained. I loved how much detail he put into developing the areas as he went on through the story. Martin also added much larger battle scenes to the book. These scenes are some of the most tense and wonderfully described parts of the book. This truly made A Clash of Kings stand out from the first book, A Game of Thrones. If he continues to add some of these larger battles throughout any future books, the books will continue to grow and be much more interesting to read.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings surpassed its predecessor in many ways. It adds larger battles, more characters, more plots, and more regions to explore. The book answered many questions from the first book, but added just as many and left me wanting to read whatever happens next. The added depth to the plot allows many more stories to be told throughout future books. A Clash of Kings is a hallmark book of the fantasy genre and will please any type of reader.s to be told throughout future books.

0553593714|5.0|A Game of Thrones is an tale of epic proportions. The story is believable and the characters are just as corrupted as one might think they would be in the real world. Every detail has meaning and you will never know what might be around the corner. This book marked the beginning of an epic journey through this well thought out world. Fantasy readers and any others will surely enjoy it.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones takes place in a wonderful and well thought out world. There are maps on the first couple of pages that really help the reader understand where all the events are taking place. Every city, every kingdom, every wilderness is brought out into full detail. You could really picture all the sights and sounds of the countryside or of the large cities that dot the landscape. There are some areas mentioned that do not happen to be included on the map, but it just makes those areas much more mysterious and interesting.<br /><br />The author, George R.R. Martin, does a good job of using multiple points of view throughout the book. We follow multiple people, from young children to important rulers, and see how each situation is presented. Many times, this provides a complete view of one event from two opposing sides. Each character you follow is also completely original. They all have their own personalities and quirks, and all have a different path that they go down. Even the people they meet, characters who don't have that much to do with the overall story and those who are guilty of causing the worst of the crimes, are well thought out and really stand out. This book is a shining example of the use of multiple points of view.<br /><br />The story line is amazing. Corrupt leaders, back-stabbing villains, and honorable lords all try to control their own destiny throughout the book. This brings major conflicts of battles, or behind the scenes assassinations to full bloom. You get to see and learn scheme after scheme of daring escapes, grand battles, and evil plots. Some are adverted while some are carried out to full fruition. This just adds to the wonderful complexity of the events. The book does a good job on keeping that complexity at a minimum and allows you to still comprehend a good deal of the hidden plans while still concealing other agendas.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is a masterpiece of fantasy. There are not many other fantasy books that are this large and open for more elaboration. The characters are well thought out and really give character to the book. The many different settings are perfectly described and really allows you to picture everything in your mind. Any fans of fantasy books should take the time and begin reading this series. If you aren't a fan of fantasy books, this is a wonderful starting point to get you hooked on the genre. You will not be disappointed.ome are adverted while some are carried out to full fruition.

1451626657|4.0|Catch-22 is a very different book than what I normally read. It is very comical, crazy, and confusing, but Joseph Heller somehow mixes all of the craziness together to create a somewhat sensible piece of literature. This is not one of my favorite books, but it is quite funny at times.<br /><br />The story takes place during World War II. The protagonist, Yossarian, is part of one the US Air Force bomb squadrons stationed in Pianosa in Europe. The war is in full swing and the squadron members continue their missions to help with the war. The actual story line of the book is very confusing. It seems like the book is made up of small little anecdotes focusing on different member's lives and experiences, but they all tie together through common characters. Some of the stories seem to be out of order chronologically at some points and made me slightly confused. Also, the characters occasionally reference events that have not been talked about in depth, further adding to the confusion.<br /><br />The characters in the book were some of the best I have ever read about. Each had specific quirks and problems that persisted consistently throughout the book. Each interaction between them always seems realistic and crazy. Each character left a unique impression  on me as I read through the book. Some characters were cowards, intellects, or just plain weird. I found myself becoming attached to them and every event had a much stronger emotional impact.<br /><br />Large picture aside, the  dialogue and events in the book are very funny. The characters constantly contradict themselves and their compatriots and create ridiculous problems. Their antics lead to sometimes unwanted results, but they always take everything in good humor. Some of the events are much more serious however, but Heller was still able to put a slight twist in them to make it a little more funny.<br /><br />The contradictions, however, created a lot of confusion for me. I found myself lost and puzzled by what exactly happened at some points in the book. I would go back and try to reread the section and I usually was able to decipher the true meaning of what exactly occurred. However, there were a few times where I was forced to continue even though I did not have an understanding of what happen. This made the book a much harder chore to read than most, and it caused me to put down the book more times than I would have liked.<br /><br />Catch-22 is a amazingly funny book. The characters were some of the most special and witty characters I have ever met. The story was very intriguing and the dialogue was comical. There is no other book I have ever read that is anything like Catch-22. However, I found myself not wanting to read the book a few times. The events created a very confusing setting to follow. If you  take the time to really read and understand the book, Catch-22 is very wonderful.xactly happened at some points in the book.

B00F2HW20M|3.0|Unfortunately it seems like the whole production is defective on the song &#34;I know what I like&#34;, I had to return the first item I got thinking to get a right one but today I received the second one and is also defective on the same place. I realized that the price now is just $21.97 when I purchased by $25.99, they should at least refund me the difference since the item is defective, it would deserve the 5 stars but I'm not totally satisfied because of these issues. In all of case I hope a recall to return it and getting it as it should in an excellent conditions.
0743277708|5.0|I've wanted to get my hands on a copy of Watership Down and read it for quite some time. The past couple of years, I have read many of Brian Jaques' brilliant series of books, Redwall. On the back cover of the book, the summary always began with &#34;In the grand tradition of Watership Down...&#34; or some other phrase almost identical to the one given. I was always curious to figure out the book that inspired so many of the books that I have read before. The opportunity finally arose and the book did not disappoint in any way.<br /><br />Watership Down is one of the most unique books I have read. I was able to see how Jaques used it as an inspiration, but I felt that Watership Down had its own unique style and tone. The story of Watership Down follows a group of small rabbits as they make their journey away from their home warren and into the wilds of the world beyond. You follow in their every leap and bound, every terror and nightmare, every triumph and celebration. I found myself wanting to continue reading just to see how events play out. There are many instances of sadness and joy, creating a very up-and-down sort of story line.<br /><br />The thing I loved most about the book were the characters. Each one has their own unique personality. Hazel is the leader and tricky rabbit of the group. Fiver is the wise rabbit with the ability to see future events. Each rabbit is created with a certain tone and dialogue that make them stand out against each other. This type of differentiation between each character is what makes books wonderful. Without it, the book would just seem like a boring story between identical characters. Every confrontation between the characters is lively and lifelike, even though this whole story is told through a rabbit's point of view.<br /><br />Watership Down is a very intriguing. The whole story is an analogy to a journey of a similar extent in reality, but everyday humans are replaced by woodland animals. This creates a completely different feel and tone to the story than if it were told through the eyes of a human. Some of the events throughout the book seem very logical if you apply them through the eyes of bunnies, but if you considered to parallel action as a human, there may be some things that may seem very... different.<br /><br />Watership Down has turned out to be one the best books I've read.The characters are wonderful and the plot is very enjoyable.

This book is definitely one of the classic books of the 20th century that everyone should read.ent feel and tone to the story than if it were told through the eyes of a human. Some of the events throughout the book seem very logical if you apply them through the eyes of bunnies, but if you considered to parallel action as a human, there may be some things that may seem very... different.<br /><br />Watership Down has turned out to be one the best books I've read.The characters are wonderful and the plot is very enjoyable.

0812548094|4.0|Stone of Tears is the powerful next book in Terry Goodkind's series, The Sword of Truth. It is filled with dangerous missions, beautiful cities, and many other wonders that we have not yet seen in the first book, Wizard's First Rule. The main cast of characters are back again to save the world from destruction. Stone of Tears is a perfect follow up book the the debut novel and surpasses its predecessor in some ways.<br /><br />The book continues right where Wizard's First Rule leaves us. After a brief build-up to the main story, we are plunged right into the thick of things. Just as in the first book, we follow Kahlan, Richard, and Zed in their quest to save the Midlands, D'Hara, and Westland. They are still the same beloved characters from the first book, with all the quirks and peculiarities, but they all grow through the book. It's interesting to see their development throughout the story. Many of the places in the book are consistent with the first.The reader will find themselves in familiar territory if they have read Wizard's First Rule, but newcomers should feel at home quite quickly. What's good about the book is that it also introduces so many new areas that have great potential for further development.<br /><br />The main story is really a work of art. I found myself wanting to keep reading no matter what was going on in the real world. It's filled with climatic scenes, huge battles, quiet moments, and love scenes. You will find yourself laughing along with the characters in some parts, crying at the sad moments, and sitting at the edge of your seat in others. Everything introduced in the book is wonderfully tied into the first. New places, ideas, and characters merge seamlessly with the world we knew of. Most of the time, we learn more about the characters. The book seemed to spend a lot of time developing the relationships and personalities of many of the characters, especially Zed, Kahlan, and Richard. This made for a more thought provoking story than just one of action and killing<br /><br />Stone of Tears adds on to its predecessor in many different ways. New characters, places, and ideas all continue to flesh out the world. We see the characters we loved come back and continue their quest to find happiness and save the rest of the world.  The book leaves room for many books to come and I look forward to reading those as well. Stone of Tears is a wonderful book that will attract fans and newcomers alike.ust one of action and killing<br /><br />Stone of Tears adds on to its predecessor in many different ways.

B00EJOCAYW|4.0|Same as rating for The Nether and for the same reasons.  Choice of grandson as a gift for Christmas.  I hope he enjoys it.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|Fun movie, nothing too serious or intense. Just for one of those lazy days when there isn't anything else on.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|Arrived earlier than expected and in good condition.  Is smaller than it appears. Enjoyment is undetermined, since It will be a Christmas gift.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My new favorite holiday movie.  Will Ferrell and Bob Newhart are fabulous. The movie is funny and has a touching message about family.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is a fantastic movie! Quietly brilliant and beautiful. On paper it's a story about pen pals. In reality, it's probably the best love story I've ever seen. If you're looking for gritty, steamy sex scenes, however, this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />As weird as it may sound, this is a story about two people- from different continents- who form a relationship of the heart and mind that is brought about by their mutual love of reading. Someday, if I'm particularly lucky, l hope to see the real 84 Charing Cross  building for myself.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Excellent read!!!<br /><br />Which is all I have to say but apparently I need to write five more words to finish
B000BRBA8S|4.0|this is a terrific movie.  I highly recommend.  Need to watch it several times in order to get the full impact.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|I have not yet seen the entire episode of Day of the Doctor, but it is pre-ordered and I followed the teasers and trailers religiously as they appeared.  I am waiting on pins and needles to receive my copy.<br />That said, I do have a question:  In re-watching some episodes, in particular the McGann tv movie, the &#34;Doctor&#34; clearly states that Time Lords have 13 lives.  If Matt Smith is the eleventh and Capaldi is the 12th... or should he be the 13th?  With the intro between Eccelson (sic) and McGann of John Hurt as the Warrior Doctor, doesn't this make Capaldi the 13th and final Doctor?  Or will Day of the Doctor assuage my fears.....<br />Based on my high expectations for the 50 anniversary special, I'm giving it a high rating, unseen.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I just started playing the game and so far it is fun! I like real hunting. I hope this gets a little more challenging.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a fascinating look at a piece of American history. The author did a wonderful job of making you feel sympathetic toward the main characters. The parallel between the modern orphan and the historical orphan was cleverly done. Probably one of the best books I've read this year.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|it's a must read, if you want to improve yourself, your organization - or understand better the people around you. Funny how we always say some people are &#34;lazy&#34; because they don't have enough willpower. this book teaches you how to build certain habbits so that they no longer require &#34;willpower&#34; - but become part of you.<br /><br />Recommend it to everyone!!!<br /><br />I printed some pictures from it and keep them on my desk - now working on improving some social behaviours -&#62; to make them habbits :)
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|Great book and great story. I couldn't help but cry at the end. I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Deplorable attempt.  The author goes into this with a natural bias and i don't fault him for doing this...but, he has to at least attempt to bd honest in his research.  He makes unsupported statements as scholarly facts. &#34;Most scholars believe...,&#34;. &#34; Of course this was impossible...&#34;  With nothing but his clearly defines bias as support.  Jesus was not born in bethlehem, but in nazareth therefore the gospel narratives were made up. Please support the statement!  John the Baptist actually baptized Jesus for the remission of sin therefore Jesus was not divine and, in fact, John was the true leader and Jesus the follower.  Please support these statements.  This is an awful book. Mot historical, not supported, not even well written.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works great! downloaded the newest drivers.  Was hoping it would work with Oracle's VirtualBox, but VirtualBox currently only supports USB 2.0, not USB 3.0 yet apparently.  Otherwise, works like a charm with my Macbook.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am a Candy Crush addict. I was super excited when I found out I could get it on my Kindle. My husband, not so much.
3899554914|5.0|If your soul is attached to the wings of two wheels with a motor this is the master tome. No other printed  work combines the efforts and artistic ability of the builders with the inspired flawless photography. A must have for the hardcore and the newbe biker.  Worth twice the price, a true bargin !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and cute. Easy to play and learn. Realistic horses and you actually have to remember to feed, groom, muck and train your horse.
B00838HSYM|1.0|The movie I received was not to be exported from the EU. It was not to be played on U.S. dvd players.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|This book is just really cute with some good humor :3. I loved it :D! If you want to get you mind off of something just read it and wonder why you can't stop giggling.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Wrapping up the story is Grisham's forte.  This tale reminds us of our ugly past, and offers hope.  I love best that his characters are people with flaws who struggle to meet life's challenges.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I rented a bike once at a park and was introduced to the front ride concept of child seats mounted on adult bikes. This led me to pour over the internet researching and comparing front mounted versus rear mounted and all of the advantages and disadvantages, etc. Ultimately, the front mounted seat was definitely the way to go. It allows you to be closer to your child as your arms are essentially around them while you drive. It also gives you a much better center of balance on the bike as all of your weight is better evenly distributed than a rear mounted bike. Also mounting and dismounting the bike are much easier than a rear mounted bike (try to get onto a rear mounted bike and you will see what I mean). The view is also much better. Instead of seeing your backside for the entire trip, they can see everything you can see and you can talk to them during the entire trip.<br /><br />I mounted the bar onto my bike and then whenever I am taking my son, I simply bring the seat attachment down and it connects with a wing nut to the bike. It slides snuggly over the mounting bar which is held between the seat and the main frame. You get a real feel that this is tightly secured and safe. Just having your child between your arms also makes you feel more control.<br /><br />I have a more unusual design of a bike (a Montague folding bike) but this didn't present any problems. I would imagine that this would fit almost any bike out there.<br /><br />One benefit that could be added is some type of clip on or fold up windshield. At times, especially in Ireland, where I am currently living, it can be quite windy and unfortunately my son takes a good share of the wind. I generally will bundle him up much more because of this, however a small windshield could be a nice benefit from the dashboard area.
B005QYKD4I|2.0|Not sure if it was my reception, but sound and video quality were poor.  Lots of action but hard to understand dialogue.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush and played it all the time on my grandmother's tablet. I was so sad it was't on kindle and now they have it.  THANK YOU AMOZON!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|In this final book of the series we again see a conflicted Katniss lead the rebel fight against the capital.  Lots of pain, death, and destruction eventually peak in a twisted catharsis for our protagonist.  The final words of each chapter create the suspense that can only be relieved by turning the page.  Despite other reviews to the contrary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game is great, but the need for 100s of crowns is ridiculous.  You can only get so far if you don't want to spend actual money on crowns.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addicting game I've ever played! So glad it is available for my kindle now. I've got it on my iPhone too!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very nice game, looks good and plays well. Would be cool to have blinds or stands. Has lots of options and upgrades
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|I am learning so much, and having fun while doing it. My daughter is nine and she knows a lot more of the answers than I do!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If anyone is on the fence about reading this book, hop off the fence and run far far away. I am forever traumatized by this book's ending.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved that The Alchemist was short and to the point. It made me question my dedication to my life and as to whether I was doing everything I needed to do to reach the goals that I have set for myself.<br /><br />It came right when I needed it.<br /><br />Un-requested blessings will always receive 5 stars,
B000XUBFE2|3.0|A very interesting twist. Death does not usually write a story.  It's a very sad story but with a twist at the end.  We all know war is hell, but to live through the pain was just too sad for me. It was an effort to finish the book. It did not leave me satisfied. Just too much misery for me.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|A truly beautifully designed app. It's simple, clean,  and fast!! Gets rid of all the clutter without me having yo hunt it down. Highly recommended.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game is cool and keeps you drawn to it. I always liked the games that you build your city and make it run the way you want. I can t figure out why it won t save all my progress in building the city. It makes me not want to play it if it won t save all the things I do to it. Good game otherwise and always there is in app purchasing too. Thanks for reading
B00FHATBGW|4.0|For the most part I liked this game. There's a lot of back and forth but the puzzles are pretty good. There's also a bonus game at the end. I love Big Fish games and would definitely by a sequel to this game.
B00139XZF4|1.0|When I first saw a trailer for this one, I thought it might be nice for my grandchildren. Wow was I ever wrong. Children's minds are like sponges and to expose them to this demonic story would do great harm to them. This story attacks the teaching of God, His Son Jesus, and all we cherish from the Bible, God's holy Word. Needless to say this video no longer resides in my home.
B007PJFIU6|3.0|Wonderful game. Nice images. But I still prefer original ones. (buy it only if you are really bored of them.)
0307120007|4.0|My son loved this book.  He liked the peek a boo, dad's scratchy face.  Very interactive book and also short.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It's been a long time since I've played a game with such a good story. It's refreshing to see that there are still games out there like this, although they are rare. Although it has a few times where you have to sit and wait for the hint button, it's well worth it.
B00CIAZ04G|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I have shared the film with multiple friends and even the reluctant watchers walk away with a new favorite movie.  Donnie Yen is magical, there is just something so awesome about his personality and calm-combine that with his fight style and you have magic.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Ok I give the book 4.5 stars because it is very well written but I couldn't give it 5 because I just totally hated the ending in every way possible ... (Slight spoiler alert) I know you aren't supposed to expect a &#34;happy&#34; ending all the time but after 3 books, to just end it this way leaves such a bummed heart of a feeling ... I do hope Hollywood sees fit to adjust the ending to something much less devastating and sad... That being said, I can't fault the author for the written word because she did great in that aspect so thumbs up for that and thumbs down for its harsh ending ... :/
B00992CF6W|5.0|Honestly  this is an amazing game. I would recommend this for 9-everyone. It teaches kids science like ores and what you need to mine them. Also you cam challenge their creativity with creative mode letting them create whatever they wish! 10 out of 10 blocks!!!:)
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|It's ok would be more fun if when I brought it I thought I buy the whole game but got to chapter 4 and it wanted me to rate the game  the link  brought me here and have to buy some more of the game so I just wish instucution were set out  so we know
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I love the fact that Lobo is in the game! I do wish that aquaman was in the game. The price on the characters are stupid. There should also be a storyline, too. Some characters are too weak like grundy. Some are too hard also like Hal Jordan and sinestro. All in all I'd give it an 7.5
B003NX75B8|5.0|I'm staring hard at my copy of Will Grayson, Will Grayson waiting on some from of genius to strike. Every once in a while you'll read a book and it will be exactly what your heart and soul needed. It will speak to a part of yourself that you have bottled up, a part that you force into silence. Not every book can have this effect on you; if it did you would be the tattered remains of yourself instad of the whole that you are. Every once in a while there will be a book that will ever so gently force you into seeing the world a little bit differently. Will Grayson, Will Grayson was that book for me.<br /><br />This book is the story of two teenage boys, both named Will Grayson, and how they cross paths one cold night in Chicago. The two Will Grayson's lives are then linked, as they end up sharing in the story of one very large, very gay teenager named Tiny Cooper. This book, this story of lives and how they become intertwined, is the story of what it means to grow up. It is the story of loving yourself and loving others, for exactly who they are.<br /><br />My book club of three read Will Grayson, Will Grayson kind of on a whim, and it is now in my top three books that we have read. I just messaged my friends in book club and asked them to share one truth that they learned from Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and this is our list:<br /><br />1. &#34;When things break, it's not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It's because a little piece gets lost- the two remaining ends couldn't fit together even if they wanted to. The whole shape has changed.&#34;<br />2. Sometimes, the only way to heal is to accept how you're feeling, and accept that it's okay. You can't wish away your problems.<br />3. Your best friend may be completely opposite of you.<br />4. Being open-minded is important, otherwise you might miss the opportunity of a great friendship.<br />5. Sometimes, you have to work hard to get what you want, but you should NEVER change who you are to get it.<br /><br />I could keep going. I could flip through the pages of Will Grayson, Will Grayson and find nuggets of truth hidden between lines of perfectly wrought teen angst. Instead, I'm going to talk to you about characters. They were so real. When I finished the book, I hugged it to my chest because there was this feeling, like a &#34;the show must go on&#34; feeling that told me those characters and their lives would continue, even though I closed the book.<br /><br />Will Grayson 1: &#34;Caring doesn't sometimes lead to misery. It always does.&#34;<br /><br />Will Grayson 2: &#34;i am constantly torn between killing myself and killing everyone around me.&#34;<br /><br />Jane: &#34;Some people have lives; some people have music.&#34;<br /><br />Tiny Cooper: &#34;Nothing's wrong. Every thing's right. Things couldn't be righter. Things could be less tired. They could be less busy. They could be less caffeinated. But they couldn't be righter.&#34;<br /><br />I'm sitting here, still staring at my copy of Will Grayson, Will Grayson, still trying to do this book justice, and I just don't know if it is possible. Here is what I can say about Will Grayson (one and two), about Tiny Cooper and Jane and Gideon, about loving yourself and not being afraid to love others:<br /><br />This book is one of those books that I would call life-changing. It's the type of book that causes you to see the world a little bit differently. It's the kind of book you walk away from changed. Now, go buy it from your local bookstore, or a Barnes and Noble, or even on amazon. Just go buy it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I freaking love this thing. I have spent countless hours already trying to complete this thing without cheating. I have yet to complete this challenging puzzle, but I still have fun twisting and turning this thing nonstop. The shell is made of a hardened plastic, but is not so hard that it would crack i dropped. It is like a thicker version of the plastic they use for soda bottles. The combination of the little metal ball and the plastic make this thing a bit noisy, it  won't bother the player but it might bother others that are doing something like watching tv, it is not obnoxiously loud but it is noticeable, but it doesn't bother me when I'm using it. This thing is pretty big, it is no bigger than a basketball, but it isn't much smaller than one either. I highly recommend you get this product, it will bring you hours of challenging fun and frustration, this is one of the hardest maze in a ball puzzles ever. it isn't indestructible, so resist the urge to heave it across the room when you mess up after making it past the halfway point. One again, buy this product, you wont regret it.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|It freezes all the time! I saved my document but still lost all my work. I understand that it is not Microsoft but it could at least have functional typing!
0744014956|5.0|what else can i say, i got this for half the price of gamestop, it is the complete guide. it has errors, but i only noticed them because others have pointed them out to me. if you arent hardcore, you would not notice these errors. highly recommend
1442366621|3.0|Thought I bought the book- my mistake. The CD is easy to follow but the book would have been easier to scan back to pages I wanted to review. It does give a good explanation of the diet with good tips and grocery list to get started.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Authentic, lively, entertaining and attractive album.  Clearly and deliberately in the footsteps of Buck Owens and Dwight Yoakum, the song selection is excellent and the execution of the music is superb.  These guys clearly loved what they were doing, and they had a great time doing it.  And we get to have a great time listening.  Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is Awesome! It's sad if you really got to know the characters, but very intense and entertaining. Best out of the 3!!
0143115723|5.0|Compelling, well-written account of the extraordinary transition Manela made from prisoner to president.  The book illustrates some of the extraordinary challenges he faced and his commitment to embracing his enemy as his partner in order to save a country.  A riveting story featuring fascinating and contrasting characters, high stakes politics, violence and conflict, social upheaval, and a truly masterful leader at work.  Well worth the read.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Good solid record. This band always produces something good on their albums. The first five tracks are perfect.<br />The band sound like they are having a great time much like on Backspacer.
0307951154|5.0|Nesbo does an exceptional job with the Harry Hole series, and he finishes the series strong.  He dares to use a different technique, giving us multiple points of view.  But he doesn't change what he has offered all along--unflinching honesty in his portrayal of a stubborn, principled, flawed, yet deeply compassionate protagonist in Harry Hole.  In many--perhaps all--of the series books, Hole has faced difficult choices.  He has, time and time again, made choices that he thinks are right, but hurt him.  In Phantom, that continues.  But his choices here are not only heartbreaking for him, they are for the reader as well.  Nesbo remains true to himself and to Hole, but it hurts like hell.  The story, as usual, is a bit intricate and none of the characters are particularly fun and beguiling.  But the landscape Hole moves through is clearly depicted and the interior terrains of the important characters are well laid out.  Nesbo has written a great series and finished it with a story that inexorably leads to Hole's, and the reader's, final heartbreak.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I have had the pleasure of seeing Joe live twice and will be seeing him and his band again in a few months.<br />Both shows we're fantastic and I fully anticipate the third time will be as well.<br />All of that being said , I think this particular live DVD is one of the best live concert shows ever recorded in the world of blues or blues/ rock. The duet guitar work with Eric Clapton is wonderful. Joe is a great emotional vocalist too.<br />If its in your budget get the CD set as well. It makes for great driving music.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Think this is my favorite all time sci-fi movie.........although the day the earth stood still is a close second........I watch this often.
B000001ESP|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever made. I have over 1500 albums and this one is in my top 5.<br />Seven perfect songs with great production,writing and sound quality. Most of these songs are played in their shows frequently. A couple are still on classic rock radio play to this day. But the real gems are Witch Hunt and The Camera Eye.<br />If you haven't yet, go see them live while you still can!
1616890835|5.0|Loved this book. Saw the documentary and wanted this for my library. Who knew that lettering artists came from so many backgrounds- knew the work just not the artist. Now can keep my eyes open to<br />more of these talented artists and their signs.
B004NJC0B6|5.0|This DVD is raw heavy and intense. The sound quality is great. Particularly for a show recorded in 79.<br />The little movie seens are cool too since there isn't a lot of footage with Bon Scott out there.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  My nephew wanted to see it so I watched also - don't know if I would have purchased it for viewing but I am glad I saw it.  Good acting; good story.

B007EC27QM|5.0|The CP+ calculated 1 + 1 = 2.  2 + 2 = 4. 3 + 3 = 6.  Then the CP+ caculated 3 - 1 = 2.  2 - 1 = 1. 4 - 2 = 2.  Based upon my experience and education during the early years of elementary school I calculated that the CP+ performed as advertised. What could be better than that?
B00GD9F59S|5.0|6 stars!  What an ending!  I will admit that this book made me blubber like a baby.  I'm actually not sure I can put into words how much I loved this series and this book in particular.  I laughed, I cried, I snorted, and I even caught myself doing the whole \\"oh snap\\" thing with my fingers a few times.  There were so many twists and turns, and I had no idea how it was going to end.  The entire book was full of awesomeness, and I felt like I was on the edge of my seat for the roller coaster ride of my life.  I could not have been any happier with how Jennifer Armentrout wrapped everything up in such an incredible way.  The growth of Alex's character was been nothing short of remarkable, and I was so proud of her heart, tenacity, and sacrifice.  As always this book was full of the unexpected, and I loved watching Alex and Aiden fight for their happy ending.<br /><br />Alex and Aiden are both remarkable characters that I have always adored, but I honestly loved every character's role in this book.  Sentinel was so fast-paced, and every twist and turn had me sucking in a deep breath and hoping for the best.  It is amazing how much all of these characters have gone through, and I have to say that Armentrout did truly write the perfect ending.  The way everything came together made absolute sense, but at the same time it left my heart very happy.  My expectations were exceeded beyond belief.  It is so bittersweet for this series to be over.  I have loved these characters so much and enjoyed every minute of laughing and crying with them.  What a wonderful conclusion to an amazing series.  Kudos to Jennifer Armentrout!
0307888681|3.0|Many people enjoyed this book, but I found it hard to read. It was written  as a summery from different journalists after the WWZ ended. There is no flow of a story line. Different Journalists give their accounts of what they heard or witnessed during  the zombie attacks. You know from the beginning of the book that humanity will be saved. You also know there was much destruction. You read after the facts, how it started, how horrible and frightening it was, and how it turned around.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. When will more levels be added? I am at 440, kindle doesn't go any higher. Please update!

B009A87ZKG|5.0|This has to be the best WW2 movie ever made !<br />Not only is it historically correct they did an amazing job of location and uniforms and vehicles.<br />The acting is superb and tells one of the most important times of WW2<br />Had politics not played such a big role during the war it would have been over alot sooner.<br />Some of the battle scenes are awesome and complex.<br />This is a must see
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun exiting game for Free!! There is always something to do and something to accomplish with the cute little minions!!
0374533555|3.0|I would have given four stars based on interesting and useful content, but  there were parts that were slow and repetitive. All in all, it's worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing on the kindle. Great graphics. Finally here! Love this app. Fun for the entire family and great for cold rainy days
0790731940|5.0|A great cast does a fabulous job bringing us top-rated humor and excitement. Lots of fun throughout. Good to see Maverick again.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Voice is clearly female  when protagonist is male and overall patronizing. Had major trouble with dialogue as big words of others recalled by the kid.. people don't speak to children using words like kinetic and exalted. This is not literature.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Kids and I love this movie.  It's fun and keeps us giggling everytime we watch it.  So happy to have found it and for a great price!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love this series i could never really predict what happened but this book was a good bittersweet ending to the series.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I really like this game a lot!  make more games like this one and I will play them.  I like all the puzzles.  maybe it can be more challenging though.  its too easy to know where to go....  it works the way it is too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addictive! Love it on my kindle.  Happy I joined the masses and downloaded the game. Great game.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I'd give Graceling 4.8 stars. It's a fantastic novel, and I really enjoyed it. Definitely on my top thirty recommendation list :)<br /><br />Ok, so the setting was fairly typical--it had a renaissance feel, complete with castles, forest(s), and snowy mountains. At first, this disappointed me; I thought I had gotten myself into yet another fantasy novel whose culture had all but been ripped from ye olde times. But after reading through the first 2 pages (usually it takes me longer than that, but hey, it was good) I was completely hooked!<br /><br />Katsa, our dauntless female protagonist, is introduced with the stellar hook that she's Graced with the ability to kill people...and this entire world is filled with people who are Graced with strange, albeit exceptional, abilties. These abilities can range from altering people's dreams to sensing people to baking the most delicious cakes (ever, of course). Those who are Graced have two different eye colors, and are typically &#34;employed&#34; by the king/ruler of a particular district.<br /><br />The plot is fascinating, good enough to make you want to finish the book in one gulp. Some aspects of the plot are a bit formulaic (aka predictable), but I think that even those parts are enjoyable. Part of the enjoyment lies in the expectation of an event or budding of a relationship, after all.<br /><br />My favorite part about Graceling was Katsa's fire and determination to change the world around her, even when she felt helpless to do so.<br /><br />My least favorite part about Graceling was the herbs; I disliked Katsa's reasoning for using them.<br /><br />Again, definitely recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I realized that I have never read &#34;The Shinning&#34; so I started with that and then followed up with &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;  Two really great reads!  I hope there is going to be another sequel.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|this movie couldn't even commit to being a big robot movie about big robots.  the big robots are incidental here.  focal points are blue hair, walking like marky mark, and fake australian accents.  For a good time, root for the big dinosaurs.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie, based on the life of Michael Oher, offensive tackle, tells how Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy took in a very low achiever and encouraged him to excel academically and athletically.  This, is spite of difference in race, portrays the power of Christian love for a fellow human being and how that love can bring great changes in the course of one's live.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Forbidden Planet<br />Great classic movie, Anne Francis very attractive, Leslie Nielson very young must be his first movie, Robbie the robot- perhaps his first appearance -
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Didn't follow the book. But it was very well done. Could of gone one for at least 2 more seasons.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Great DVD collection. I like being able to watch the set instead of having to wait for the next part. Great acting and action scenes.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is just a great movie. My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed it. It seemed like it was over way to soon.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I found the book repetitive in its content.  One would think that having experienced &#34;heaven&#34; there would be so much to tell.
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|better quality action scenes than previous in series.  All star cast adds better drama to action filled title and series
B00FF9SKSK|5.0|loved this movie and all the Fast and furious movies, so sad to see that paul walker just died, these have been by far my favorite movie franchise of all time!!
