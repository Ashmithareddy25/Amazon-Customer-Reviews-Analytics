B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game it's awesome I'm a 5 million  but  the thing that Pisses me off is the character costs and the boards why can't the themes stay like online I saw a Halloween one with zombie  characters now I can't get them or I brought elf tricky an  lost her cause I restarted my kindle but she should already be saved on my account other then expensive characters and not keeping themes keep it comming
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Very, very good.  Brolin really nailed the younger &#34;K&#34; character in mannerisms, voice and looks.  The cast and storyline were excellent.  Highly recommend this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you liked the first book you have got to read this one as well. Can't wait to read the next one.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app.  It is great to vew videos and music.  Even my son didn't know about it and has been using it and loves it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the kind of book that touches your heart. It makes you laugh, cry, and just smile, but also feel empathetic.  This book can be read at any level. It is easy to read and each time you read it, you can learn a new lesson in life. I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love that you can do things with your horse that you can do with a real horse.I mean you can brush it feed and enter them in contests
0062119044|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book. I enjoyed both very much. The book arrived within a couple of days and is in beautiful, new condition. Very satisfied.
0425263908|2.0|Not an original story !!!!<br />I had never in my life read two books that were almost exactly the same. Bare to You is as close to Fifty Shades of Grey as a book can get but without the special connection existing between the main characters.  Very disappointed !
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this daily and it is easy to use!  If you have a yahoo account you will be happy with this app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so much fun i love the way the picture come to life in a amazing way so much fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book it was great. I cannot wait to read the second one. Everyone talks so bad about this book but it truly was a great love story. I would recommend it to anyone. Loved it.
B0088WFZQG|1.0|dull and boring and the acting is horrid i really did not enjoy this one to be honest not one bit
B005GFPZYK|5.0|On the book:  This is a fascinating accounting of Kyle's time in the service and his struggles to adapt to life after the Navy.  He comes through as a tough guy, no question, but it is his humanity that shines through as a person who grows as a man to adapt and thrive in a world more gray than black and white.<br /><br />On the man:  I wish I could have met him and thanked him personally for all he did to protect this country and for his enormous heart that let him reach out to so many.  It's hard to process how such a senseless tragedy could take away someone who already survived so much.<br /><br />Thanks Chris, for all you did and heaven has had to make room for one bad-ass new angel.<br />-J. Gregory Smith
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app is great!  I wish it had a % funciton but it doesn't.  I still use it alot and it is handy to have available!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Just saw this with the wife.  Guess I didn't see it in the theater because I heard how violent it is.  And, yes, it is violent, but most of it is cheesy CGI violence.  My wife didn't like it though.  What we did like was the interplay between Dredd and his rookie partner, who was fantastic.  Loved how they used her mutant ability.  The setting was alive and believable.  The action was exciting and loved how he used different ammo types.<br /><br />I am hoping that it is doing well enough on video to warrant a sequel.  I would love to see additional adventures of Dredd and the rookie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't it's just like so And like cool really cool and lots of stuff on it like yaidek yjceb
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I hope u got this game my fav game ever loveit this games is on list id 1# that's why I can't give up this game I liv it so much!!:)
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I join facebook years ago cause i found out many missionaries our church supports was there. The something good happened; I found long lost family members on Facebook  so now I can get to know them over again. I have closer family members also on there and Facebook seem to be the on ly way we commuicate cause with work schedules and our busy lives we rarely see on another any more. So i want to delte Facebook but don't want to lose contact agin with family members so I'm a facebook hostage.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I like this product.  I like the fact that it rotates for either portrait or landscape view.  I wish that the &#34;notches&#34; on it were more secure to hold the position desired. Because they aren't &#34;secure connecting&#34; you must have this on a flat surface at all times.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game for nearly two weeks.  I am not sure if I was too good at advancing, but all of a sudden, it was taking over 5 minutes to load up the game.  After a few more days I couldn't stand it anymore and had to just delete it.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Amazon customers who have not read Ian Rankin need to get on board. There are many thriller writers among the Brits, but Rankin - in my view- is at the top of the list and in this novel is in top form.  His characters are believable and in this novel he again features Inspector John Rebus, a man who loves to buck the system and marches to his own drummer right to the an end where he again prevails.<br />Check it out; I think you'll love Ian Rankin.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|What I love about Sean Carroll is that he can deliver very complicated theory and partical physics in understandable lay terms while at the same time being laugh out loud funny.  He is a treasure!
B009SJ3H8Q|2.0|It's all about blood and gore, boring and not very smart.  So far very dissapointed.  Really liked the mystery and characters of the first season and find hating everyone in the second.  It is ridiculous.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|entertaining fun I play it almost every day I lil this game a lot I think who ever else gets this game will like it
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Got the app for my daughter who loves Pinkie Pie but we can't get the app to work at all<br />Very disappointed
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Excellent Movie ! This is  one of my favorite Dark Knight movies, I receommed it, the Joker is the real deal
B0000AOV85|5.0|Showed me behind the scenes glimpses of how the music I love was made, and some of the story behind the music.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Much praise has been given and they're well deserved. What more can I possibly add? Tina is someone I admire and this goes to show her brilliant wit and wordsmithing prowess. I liked the little glimpses she offered about the world of SNL, 30 Rock, and even a bit about her personal life.<br /><br />I chose not to read this book from start to finish in one sitting, as I do with other funny books. Instead, I read this book everyday till I was done while on the train to and from work, which was a great way to start and end the work day because I literally laughed out loud so much. Because I was reading it on my tablet, curious passengers had no idea what I was laughing about since they couldn't see what I was reading, but I'd bet some were dying to know (unless they probably thought I was deranged).
0788859544|5.0|Bought the DVD for my daughter as a Christmas gift<br />We love watching it over and over again<br />Worth every penny spent on it!
B004LWZW42|4.0|Although there are some flaws within the history/story of how Xavier began and how he ended in his chair, it's still an excellent movie. If you've collected all the others, then you'd want this one, too. The correlation between Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) was very well done. Good X-Men history lesson. Flaws and all.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  It's funny and entertaining, but also technical enough to be very interesting.  As far as I could tell all of the technical explanations were spot on (as an engineer and sci-fi nerd I really hate it when writers get things wrong or don't understand what they're writing about).<br /><br />My only critique is that there are a lot of typos (by a lot I mean 1 or two per chapter, so not a ton).  When you're really into what you're reading a typo feels like hitting a speed bump when you're driving 65 miles per hour.  Ouch. It's $0.99 though, so I guess typos are to be expected.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I haven't tried it yet but I'm gettinng it and ive seen really great comments on it. hope its good. will report after I try it.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Dan Brown does another excellent job of developing both male and female primary characters.  Both contribute wonderfully to the almost-real-world scenario in this pell-mell  romp in the computer field.  Excitement and action is non-stop, and the reader quickly develops a sense of familiarity with the characters.  There are lots of unexpected twists and turns in the story line which leads to a whale of a climax in Brown's inimitable style.  Very satisfying!
B00005JPO1|5.0|And the wait was well worth it! The tie-ins worked great. Older Indy, of course, but who cares? Exciting, good story line. SOME of the supporting cast did some over acting, but the movie itself had all the charm of the three before it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched two seasons on Netflix and felt in love with it. The third season was either on Hulu or Amazon. Hulu denied my device so here I am proud customer of Amazon Instant  Video.<br /><br />I love the show and service as well.
0071766588|4.0|El libro es muy útil para prepararse para el examen, ojo! Es una herramienta útil para este fin, no para aprender ingles. Sin embargo si usted no está seguro de presentarlo el libro le puede dar unas luces al respecto, pues  por medio de las prácticas versus tiempo uno puede hacerse una idea del nivel. Podría mejorar si los test de practica fueran más difíciles que el test real, me parecen un poco suaves en comparación con el verdadero. Por eso no le doy las 5 estrellas.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a fun, upbeat and perfect movie for the lover of music, voice or theatre! Some of the humor was off for me, but overall a great story with amazing music and talent(:
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|This movie is a pre-quel to all of the X-Men with Wolverine (wouldn't that be all of them?) Goes into excellent details as to how his story began. So far... of all of them... it's my favorite.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I have a very special connection with Sherlock Holmes so thoroughly enjoy trying to work out the conundrums he is faced with. Problem is Conan Doyle is not around to write more!! Enjoyed having all works together.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A young boy tries different religions searching for God.  Later he is a lone survivor of a sinking ship transporting him and his family to Canada.  He is in a life boat with a tiger and goes thru many adventures.  Many of my friends found the book initially hard to read.  &#34;After you get thru the first 100 pages it  gets better&#34;, they told me.  After I saw the movie I knew I wanted to read the book and did not find it difficult at all.  To the contrary I found it very interesting and philosphical on everyday life topics as the boy tries the different religions and then is stranded on the life boat.  I liked it very much and found it easy to read.  I tried a sample on my Kindle and knew I wanted to get it, you may as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All the Hunger Games books were very good and I enjoyed them all.  Purchased these on Kindle and would recommend someone reading them.  Hopefully the movie version will be better than the first book of the trilogy.
B00B8PQC5S|1.0|I had high expectations for this film. Two letters in I thought this film was going to be very good. Then it was all down hill.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It just wasnt what I was expecting from the author. It was boring and just not my type of book. Harry Potter was way better
B00ANW33CM|3.0|Would be much better if had an option to enlarge the tiles.  I like the design.  What I can make out of the tiles looks cute.  However, they are rather small( I am playing it landscape on Kindle Fire HD.)<br />I agree with other reviews regarding need for having UN-timed option.  I too like to relax as I play these types of games.<br />Over all it is a cute game.  Just not for those of us with vision problems. Or for those who dislike &#34;beating the clock&#34; games.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the Hunger Games books were very good and I enjoyed them all.  Purchased these on Kindle and would recommend someone reading them.  Hopefully the movie version will be better than the first book of the trilogy.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|absolutely intrigued most games take forever to gain funds enough to progress- not this one. I love love love it!!
B000ZN802W|4.0|This movie pulls at the heart strings and can be a little harsh to some. Being based on a true life story it is a little hard to swallow some outcomes
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am addticed to this game. the more friends you have the better too.  it makes you want to keep playing to beet their scores.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I loved it! John Corey is a great character with a fantastic sense of humor. Exciting story. I couldn't put it down. If you love Nelson DeMille as I do, you'll enjoy it, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really awsome,cool, fun,great it self cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Great songs, great artist, have seen her in person and this cd does her proud. Will be looking for more.

B00571F26Y|2.0|Some people should just write a paper on a topic & get to the point. Dont bore us all with a long winded book! It made me hungry for less!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this is a super fun game but once I downloaded it and played it once noe it wont even load to play it anymore! it is a waste of space kn my kindle and Imangi needs to fix it!!!!!
B00006LFGD|5.0|Love the duets on this cd.  The BeGees being a couple of my favs. Also Neil Diamond and Celine Dion.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|loved these two books-can't wait for the next...great twist on futuristic paranormal genre...would make an interesting movie.  when is next book coming out?
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|He has an amazing way to describe a new world that breaks away from the normal regime. It makes for a great read !
B003DZX3US|1.0|I did not have the pleasure of watching this movie, although it is one of my favorites. I did not own a blu-ray at the time, and gave it away to a friend for his kids.
B00B5D32XS|5.0|I watched the first one very good and couldnt wait to see the next season this is a great season
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good I love it it may be hard to you but not me you will love it so much  when
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a most intriguing book...I couldn't put it down and will recommend it to everyone I know!  I gave it to my son to read on his plane trip tomorrow.  The best part is that it is a true story!  I have been waiting for the link between science and spirituality.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I had viewed this movie a few times in my life, but I was not interested as much as before, this time
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|when I would first see this game. I would. ignore. it, but I down loaded. it to get coins for another game. now I lbs it
1616550414|5.0|Even if you are not a Zelda fan or know little about this game ( which i doubt ) this is an excellent book to own...
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This item was given as a gift.  The recipient was very pleased with it and thought Will Smith was great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is incredible! It will definitely train your brain to help improve logic and reaction skills. It is also a great way to pass time if you are waiting for anything or if you are just bored. This is also a very fun game that is set up perfectly. It is one of the best games I have played in years. I have found no issues with this game. And there are many levels. And it also provides a great feeling of accomplishment with each passing level! So, to sum it up, This is a fantastic game for all ages and it makes you smarter AND IT'S FREE! I recommend this game to everyone! So, go get it now and enjoy the many levels of fun!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was unbelievable! If you ever feel like your in an awkward situation, or even an awkward place in your life read this book and you will learn that confidence is key in everything you do. From meeting knew friends to going after the girl/ boy of your dreams even if they are your best friend. Finally, just think that if your ever sad their are people that have it worse! I loved this book!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I'm amazed at how unaware we are regarding what we eat and put into our bodies. I used to be like that, fast food burger, fries and shake - easy, fast, and cheap. But it's really digusting knowing where this inhumane mass produced \\"beef\\" comes from. This movie is a huge eye opener to what really goes on behind the scenes of food production in America. Not just fast food, but any restaurant- almost everywhere you go this is where food comes from unless it's grown locally or labeled Organic/GMO/Grass-Fed.<br /><br />If you like to eat, watch this movie. (Just don't do it while eating).
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I think Harrison Ford is a terrific actor and he makes these stories great.  Anyone who likes adventure stories will like this item.
0765325950|1.0|Lousy finish to a great series.  Robert Jordan's wife should have left the series unfinished instead letting another author attempt to an ending. BS should be ashamed of himself for attempting to recreate someone else's ideas. I bought the book an read it but was very disappointed with the ending.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I convinced my husband to watch the pilot, expecting it to be another show that only one of us liked. (Which means we would never get very far into it, like so many other series.) Happily, that was not the case! Claire Danes is perfect as Carrie, and the rest of the cast are smart and interesting characters. The plot is surprising, and the twists and turns keep you wanting more! We devoured the whole series over 3 days -- a first for us! We will pre-order season 2, for sure!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|The 1st 300 pages are really good. They have a great buildup. After that it goes downhill. Stephen King decides to add a pointless love story that halts the entire story for 250 pages. This book could've easily been 500 pages long if not for that. I heard a lot of good reviews and decided to check it out, but it was a major disappointment.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This item was given to someone else as a gift.  The recipient reported that he enjoyed the movie very much.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book many times growing up. I loved the story of an orphaned girl being sent back to England, her discovery of a hidden garden, and how she coaxes both the garden and her new family back to life. A must for every child.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|This is a good app but am no longer able to use it on my kindle fire as  the update is not working.  I am also not aware of how to save favorite podcasts.  This could be a 5 star app if these could be fixed.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Mars' infusion of reggae, rock 'n roll, and ballads is a terrific balance of music to make his sophomore album a successful one.  This record is outstanding start to finish.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A must read for any age at any point in your life.  EndIng this book as soon as possible End of story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that Subway Surfers is a super fun addicting game. This is a super child appropriate game. It's a easy game for all ages of people to play.
B0055S348W|2.0|This application will print from your web browser if you open the URL from within PrinterShare. However, it will not print E-mails, because there is no way to open the Kindle E-mail application from within PrinterShare. Since that is the primary reason I bought the product, it was a waste of time and money. NOT recommended, unless your primary goal is to print web pages.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Buble's people did a great job of capturing this inspiring concert performance at the most famous arena in the world.  Both the CD and video productions were of high quality both visually and sound-wise.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who appreciates a live performance of a truly gifted voice.  Amazon did an excellent job of getting this product out in an expedient manner and it came right away.  Go buy this combo pack today...
B0020BUWX2|5.0|My granddaughter recommended this to me.  I thought it would be a little juvenile but she was adamant I would like,this and I did.  Well written, fast-paced and sweet.in
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Worth every dollar! Every Superman fan have to buy this!<br />I like the quality of the movies, if you think that the was filmed in 1978 (the first one), they did a really good job.<br />:-)
B0086700CM|4.0|Would recommend this game.  Everyone seems to like Temple Run.  Five to 30 seems to be able to enjoy the game.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This was written when I was in high school, and so much of it has been adopted into the standard mythos that it's a must read. The back and forth between Batman and the Joker is a great view into the minds of both characters, in as few words as possible.<br /><br />The illustrations are fabulous and the story is perfectly understated.
B00005JNJV|5.0|What can I say, Christian Bale is the best Batman yet! Remember when Clooney tried it?<br />Hah! Buy this DVD here and save some bucks!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Arrived in time, the movies it self are very nice, but the &#34;Book&#34; with the movies was no good. I mean, The top cover is was not bend well, and now remained poorly marked and hard to remove.<br />I don't know if all the copyes are like my, or i just had bad luck :-(
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like the game and play it most days when there is time.  Would recommend this game and would get again.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is a very fun game.it is a good way to keep contact with your friends. I would recommend this app to anyone.5 stars!!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Well, I bought this DVD for one reason. Heath is the best Joker ever. Remember when Jack Nicholson tried the role? Hah! Well anyway, This has to be Heath Ledgers best effort. What's even better, is I can relate to his role as the Joker! Buy it here and save bucks!
B009JBZH54|5.0|The only thing that i can't believe is that in &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; have a few senes in full screen, why they did not fix the whole film is in the same format? it's a shame i'm think.
B0067DBHBU|5.0|Not a bad song on the CD. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _
B008YU0AOE|5.0|The Pro Free Calculator was perfect for what i needed. I was helping my son with his Algebra homework and we needed a scientific calculator and this one fit the bill perfectly. I highly recommend, easy to use, had all the features required for this class.
1401238580|5.0|loved the set- complete graphic novel with Guy Fawks mask..excellent gift for an avid reader and fan. Highly recommended. Great
B00899F0G8|5.0|Good quality streaming. Fast. Good qaulity picture and sound. No hiccups. Available quickly. I can not think of anything else to say.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love this series.  Can't wait to get to the next show.  Have downloaded 3 seasons.  If you love BBC shows, you'll love this
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I find myself getting totally lost in this world. The characters are marvelous even the evil ones! Just finished season 3 and can't wait for 4!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a quick read, a simple storyline without too many complications.  The second book may have been better than the first with an ending to hook you into the third.
B006VP1OYO|5.0|This is a great set of songs of My Bloody Valentine, specially their very early tracks such as \\"You Made Me Realise\\"... looking forward to get their new album \\"M B L\\" (after 22 years since Loveless)..
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It had drama, romance, and a surprise ending.  What more could you ask for?  i would recommend it.
B0042L78MG|5.0|Fast delivery, all good. Listening to it all the time in the car and at home. :)<br />I can't wait to see a concert too!
B005KISGXA|5.0|I gave this toy as a gift and the little boy loved it! This lego set is a lot of fun and educational! Perfect gift!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was the first time I rented a movie off of Amazon - and it was great! I was able to view it instantly! Watch this movie!
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|it is one of those sounds that you can only respect.. .it energizes you... makes you move... it moves you no matter what..
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This was a great family movie that was enjoyable for the kids and even me. Fun and full of adventure
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Really fun game. Had a blast playing. Made me use my head to get throught some of the puzzles. Worth paying the $2.99.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app at work. It is a vital app for me. I recommend this to anyone that works or goes to school.
B002P3RCVU|5.0|new with the essence of a time not long gone.. he is good.. he brings in the sound a mist... spice.. surprise..
B001GCVFHI|4.0|The book was chosen due to my English class which I am taking at college. I think it was an interesting  story.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|This is an original concept game has some good and some bad going for it, which seems to be a direct result of the developer not having a clear understanding of the app's purpose nor its target market.  That is, I'm not sure anyone who plays Mahjong is going to like this app because it's trying to appeal to too many different people simultaneously, and failing at all of them.<br /><br />I'll hit the Pros and Cons first, then offer some thoughts, though in random order.<br /><br />---------------------<br />PROS:<br />Originality/Uniqueness<br />Nice backgrounds<br />Nice music and sound effects<br />Nice textures on the tile images<br />Exiting is possible<br />3D, Zoom, and Reset controls<br />Other than Network Access to pitch you their other products when you press the ... button on the home screen, no undue permissions or in-app purchases.<br />84 Levels<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not Really Mahjong, but rather Matching<br />Unable to save game for later<br />Rapid countdown timer<br />Nauseating scenery and elements<br />Poor Graphics<br />Confusing and Unreliable UI<br />Poor handling of graphics and textures, especially overlays<br />Massive Download 35+MB for a Mahjong game<br />---------------------<br /><br />The 3-D nature is interesting.  The controls are backward, but not all the time.  And that's if you can get past the title screen without getting dizzy, or the level selection screen without becoming motion sick.  (Do NOT click on the white and purple round \\"I\\" without Dramamine or naval/astronaut training experience!)<br /><br />The music is nice, but not anything to rave about; they are more or less calming to a point, though the level selection screen music is very much a lullaby.  At least the level selection screens seem to all be unlocked which allows you to choose one of four level selection screens and each of those have 21 levels, and each of those levels have three star holders (which are difficult to separate between the levels; there seem to be three rows of 21 stars rather than seven planets with three stars each.<br /><br />The graphics are a mixed bag, too.  You'll recognize the background images as being standard-issue NASA space images.  They are indeed quite beautiful.  Unfortunately, the graphics of the tiles are subpar, and the poorly created textual overlays, such as the numbers on the screen, are badly jagged and of poor quality.  The developer worried far too much on animation and spinning graphics and not nearly enough time on other elements that matter equally or more than the elements in motion.  Also interesting about the graphics is that the tiles are comprised of images which would appeal to children and tiles that would appeal to adults, all intermixed.  Just odd.<br /><br />There's no tutorial to speak of, but it isn't terribly necessary as you learn that, as the description says, if you can see it then you can try to match it.  Well, that's fine, I suppose, for a matching game, but Mahjong is much more intricate than a matching game.  You tap a tile, then search around for a match. You cannot unselect a selected tile, but you can simply choose to change the focus of the selection to another tile and highlight it instead.<br /><br />Here's a confusing element to the game that seems to detract from its Mahjong roots: in the level itself, there is an extremely rapid countdown timer, which I suppose is supposed to enhance your points score.  Nothing else seems to happen if the timer reaches zero.  However, when you move, the timer resets and again counts down.  While some people may try to gain points, or to beat a previous score in deconstructing the stack, it's mostly a pointless exercise to offer points, especially in this manner.  Most people I know play the game to relax, not be mentally stimulated by twists, turns, and crazy countdowns.  Also in the levels there appear these \\"portals\\" that don't seem to have any purpose, as well as flickering dots that also have no discernible purpose.<br /><br />On the other hand, despite confusing rotational controls, the functions that zoom in and out work well.  Tapping the screen resets the orientation to the primary face at the default zoom level, which will be very handy in more complex levels for people that tend to get lost in the 3-D rotational environment.<br /><br />It's not terrible, not even bad, really.  It just needs some focus, some direction, and some well-rounded care with less attention on spinney, shiney baubles and more on the aesthetics of the graphics and textual overlays.  It's an interesting title to have in my library, but I honestly can say that I won't be spending much time playing this, which is why I'm giving it three stars - it's better than two stars (barely).e.<br /><br />On the other hand, despite confusing rotational controls, the functions that zoom in and out work well.

B00B04NJLW|1.0|I watch a lot of horror movies, hardcore horror movies at that, but I draw the line when it comes to kids in a sexual nature. The ABC's of Death was decent with good and bad ones scattered. But when I got to L and they had a part where a man has sex with a young boy under 10 years old, it's implied does not actually show it but it shows a man walking up to a bed with a boy on the bed the cuts away and gives you sounds and shows enough that sex is in progress without showing the boy at all. This is unacceptable to me. I am glad I watched this before I bought it. I have to give this a one star and will not recommend this movie to anyone.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|the english scene has her to only show off.. and it is well deserved.. can not dismiss.. can not pass
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app had horrible reviews, but I wanted someway to check FB with my Kindle Fire HD. I installed the app with a little apprehension at first. The first time I used the app, all of the negative reviews lost their credibility. This app shows my news feed, I can write and respond to posts with no problems, and it is even easy to upload photos. I am very satisfied with this Facebook App.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and great soundtrack too. All around amazing film. My husband and I watch it several times a year.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|Whenever I need to jot something down, ColorNote Notepad is there for me. I can even color code my notes. This app has shown no problems. It works well with my Kindle Fire HD. I haven't used the calendar section much, but what I have put into the calendar has worked out well.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I hesitated for awhile before buying this - it seemed like it was going to be dark and psychological. It is, but it is absolutely riveting as well. I didn't have any idea how complex this book was going to be, or how much I would NEED to know what was happening in the life of the main character, as she has no memory and therefore is the ultimate &#34;unreliable reporter&#34; of her own story. Wow! That's all, just Wow!  This is a must-read for the mystery fan.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The whole family enjoyed the movie.<br />It had a funny and  delightful ending.  The<br />kids wanted to watch it several times.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I like to watch it on Amazon video because there are no commercials. Also if I miss an episode I can catch up on there as well.
0062238868|1.0|Content aside, this book was poorly written- which probably isn't too big of a deal if you consider the target audience. After I read this book, it was shredded and used as filling in my cat's litter box. I don't regret the $10 I spent, because I just had to read it for myself. In no way would I consider myself a tree-hugger, but the contents of this book are vile and appalling. After the laborious chore of reading this was complete, apart from being disgusted that something like this is not only accepted, but celebrated, I also felt an overwhelming sadness for what we as people have become. I can't recommend this poison to anyone.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, it wasn't that great as litter box fill, either.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this app. it is a fun way to kill time. it is not something I want to waste tons of time on. but it is great to kill 15 minutes.
B007SGM084|1.0|I was fed up with mur-murring and details of how her c-nt was clenching on every page! Cmon there are more words to use in English vocabulary! I thought reading erotic book on a boring trip will entertain me, but it made it even worse! Such a piece of junk. There are better quality (talking about the style and use of language) stories even on porn sites! I regret i bought a trilogy all together, thinking it will be a fun book to read with some intrigue or story but its just a plain BS!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome. I can't think of anything else to say but you have to use so many words to review.
B0002HZHXG|2.0|There is no way to mount it to trucks. Also, it is defficult for young children (under 5) to change the reflectors, so I do not recommend it for them.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|If you like Jack Reacher, you will enjoy this outing:  Reacher  novels are my guilty pleasure.....he's strong, capable and does things his way with his sense of right and wrong.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you like the Alien movies, you might like this.  While it wasn't as intense as the others, it does provide a background as to where the monsters came from.  Throw in a space ship, space travel, exploring a new planet and, of course, creatures, it is good.  Not great, but good.<br /><br />The 3D is good, while not exploiting it.  Since I just got my first 3D TV, I would like a movie that does take it to the limit!  I expected 3D to be gimmicky.  What I discovered is it is natural and 2D is dull!  After all, we have two eyes, so we see in 3D.<br /><br />This doesn't come close to Aliens, but I enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why do we have redstone and not being able to use it?  I love everything about this game almost. i also love the fact that u r putting more and more stuff in the game. also i lt would be cool to have other monsters like enderman and cave spiders ect. other than that i love the game
B006OB3K56|5.0|This movie helps people understand how sexual disorder affects a person's life.  Society may accept this, but the hardship that goes on in a person's mind is a calamity of trying to cope with their secret.  It was a movie that raises the psychological issue of how people live with sexual disorders and how it is still in the closet, even though people know about it.
B0072CPDE2|5.0|Space or money limited? This is the one The Doors album you should have. All the greats from the greatest performances. Not a bad cut on any of the Four sides.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp once again commands the action and solves the problem presented while still keeping to his higher morals.  Having read all of the Rapp series this was not what I expected in his one.  I thought it would be more about Rapp's past.  I like how characters keep appearing in other books.

B0076DELIG|4.0|This is an excellent read! as most of Mr. Connelly's books are. His books are exciting and hard to put down once you start reading one.  I find myself anxiously awaiting his next 'Harry Bosch' book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is very fun. i must say though, the giant monkey scared the crap out of me the first couple times! the only thing i must complain about is that it seems harder to steer
1616550414|5.0|Seeing the sketches and notes, the backstory as development for such an amazing series makes you appreciate and love the games that much more. A gift any Nintendo fan would love.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|This movie was a gift and as far as I know the owner loves it. I have not heard any complaints....I also watched both of the these films and have been pretty happy with what I have seen. Downey Jr. does a good job and so does Law, I would definitely recommend this if you like mystery and action.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|watt better than the first temple run. I love it. cant think of anything negative.to say at all its great!
B008PJ3IDO|2.0|I wanted to like this, but between the depressing and uninspiring, though thoroughly tough, music and the fact that there have been 3 other albums in the past 5 years called Walking Papers, this just doesn't come across positively to me.  The music is technically proficient, but that's not always the most important thing about music.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Interesting read. Funny and informative at the same time. Recommended for anyone who is anxiously awaiting the zombie apocalypse. lol
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game can be anoing becuas when I play th game it will go back to the home page and so if you guys know how too fix polroblems like this then please tell me
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|The Monster High videos are what well meaning if ultimately unhelpful activists in the bad old days of my youth used to call one hour commercials, that is animated children's TV shows based upon an existing line of toys.  (Frankly, I never understood the alleged vast moral difference between doing this as opposed to creating the TV show FIRST and only THEN merchandising the crap out of it with dolls, action figures, boardgames, Underoos, etc., but I digress.)  What matters most is the writing, and these videos are VERY well written!<br /><br />One of the things that makes the Monster High videos work so well is that the writers are gently making fun of the fashion doll mania that they are in fact trying to promote. Taking the universal American experience of High School and adding the twist of the entire student body being the children of famous monsters gives them endless possibilities for parody (and self parody, as the heroines are for the most part over the top, fashion crazed, popularity obsessed teenagers).  The animation and voice acting is no slouch, either!<br /><br />Chronologically the first movie is \\"Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love\\", which was the 3rd TV special, in fact the Valentine's Day Special.  Draculaura, Dracula's daughter, is turning Sweet 16, hundred that is, on February 14th, and the movie starts with what turns out to be Draculaura's idea for the perfect party,... to the horror of her ghoulfriends tasked with planning something that meets her insanely high expectations, though it turns out she comes by them honestly.  It seems that 400 years ago, her first boyfriend, a vampire named Valentine, created Valentine's Day just for her, but due to a \\"misunderstanding with the locals\\" (explained more fully in \\"Ghoul's Rule\\") she and her family had to flee the Old Country before the party so EVERY birthday/Valentine's Day party since gets measured in her mind against that first one she missed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Monster High meany Toralei, miffed at not being invited to the party (because she's such a cruel jerk!), decides to get even by inviting Valentine (mimicking Draculaura's voice) to transfer to MH and renew their relationship.  Meanwhile, current Draculaura boyfriend, Clawd Wolf, facing similarly insanely high expectations, is walking the disaster strewn Path of \\"Practical Gifts\\".  After discovering that Draculaura is in real danger, and after C.A. Cupid misses the mark, quite literally, it is up to Draculaura's ghoulfriends to salvage a happy ending.  Gently Pushed Moral: Given the choice, dump the Fantasy in favor of the Real.<br /><br />Chronologically the second movie is \\"Friday Night Frights\\", which was the 5th TV special.  This is the story of how the MH version of Roller Derby (or is that Rollerball?) became coed after long tradition of male only teams, despite the fact that the first Skulltimate Roller Maze superstar a century ago was a girl, the mysteriously vanished Robecca Steam. Opening a year hence with the current coed team about to hit the floor, the movie flashes back a year to the Gravel City Gargoyles beating the MH team by cheating, which injured coach and best player Clawd Wolf (along with several other players) so badly that he's out for the season, effectively ending it for MH, until Frankie Stein gets another one of her crazy ideas: let ghouls play.  But this so goes against tradition that the remaining healthy male members quit the team in protest.  Now it is ALL up to our heroines to learn to play the game, to learn to WIN the game, to recruit the right ghouls, and to save their school (again, quite literally).  Gently Pushed Moral: Just because it's tradition doesn't mean it's good.<br /><br />Note: The earliest Monster High DVD was the 1st TV special \\"New Ghoul at School\\" but it was only made available in limited editions of the Dawn of the Dance series of dolls:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0052D2HUQ Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Ghoulia Yelps Doll with exclusive DVD]],<br />[[ASIN:B0052D2I2I Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Cleo De Nile Doll with exclusive DVD]],<br />[[ASIN:B0052D2HGK Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Lagoona Blue Doll with exclusive DVD]],<br />Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Deuce Gorgon Doll with exclusive DVD, and<br />Monster High Dawn Of The Dance 3 Pack: Clawdeen Wolf, Draculaura, and Frankie Stein Dolls with exclusive DVD,<br /><br />until recently when it was reissued as a retailer exclusive both separately: [[ASIN:B00LWJ3OB0 Monster High: New Ghoul At School]] and as part of a 2-pack: [[ASIN:B00M0CHBY4 Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature - Fright On! / Escape from Skull Shores / Monster High: New Ghoul At School]] with:<br /><br />the sixth Monster High DVD, [[ASIN:B00JPA7VUS Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature - Fright On! / Escape from Skull Shores]], which contains the 2nd and 4th TV specials respectively.<br /><br />The second Monster High DVD was [[ASIN:B008KXLAUS Monster High: Ghouls Rule]], which was the 6th TV special.<br /><br />The fourth Monster High DVD was [[ASIN:B00DY1KPMK Monster High: 13 Wishes]], which was the 9th TV special.<br /><br />The fifth Monster High DVD was [[ASIN:B00HF5J9TG Monster High: Frights, Camera, Action!]], which was the 10th TV special.<br /><br />The seventh Monster High DVD was [[ASIN:B00LN2WKGQ Monster High: Freaky Fusion]], which was the 12th TV special.ll with exclusive DVD]],  [[ASIN:B0052D2HGK Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Lagoona Blue Doll with exclusive DVD]],  Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Deuce Gorgon Doll with exclusive DVD, and  Monster High Dawn Of The Dance 3 Pack: Clawdeen Wolf, Draculaura, and Frankie Stein Dolls with exclusive DVD,    until recently when it was reissued as a retailer exclusive both separately: [[ASIN:B00LWJ3OB0 Monster High: New Ghoul At School]] and as part of a 2-pack: [[ASIN:B00M0CHBY4 Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature - Fright On! / Escape from Skull Shores / Monster High: New Ghoul At School]] with:    the sixth Monster High DVD, [[ASIN:B00JPA7VUS Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature - Fright On! / Escape from Skull Shores]], which contains the 2nd and 4th TV specials respectively.

B000XUBFE2|3.0|I Love books that are sent during the time I wasn't born. I found this book way to confusing and at times boring. I am happy I even finished it at times I felt like the author or the book was getting better but I was wrong.

B00009Y3L4|2.0|so many comments abourt Liza vying for the B rating b/c of the low class/talent Kit Kat Klub... my first viewing, was so shocked how poorly she sang/acted/danced... of course to be fair was expecting Judy level talent so prolly too high expectation... and if this was sposed to be so low rent choreography why the heck hire Fosse for mediocre numbers... altho I was impressed with the Two Girlie number, very creative and watchable vs vaudvillian prancing and hip thrust moves...  I found the only two folks scene stealing was Fritz n Natalia esp the marriage ceremony, brought all the issues side stepped throughtout the film together and made for a heart wrenching touching moment severely lacking elsewhere... maybe if Liza did a dance number in the library exclaiming her delicate situation woulda made for some real entertainment... as for Joel just too over the top for any humorous response and the obvious correlation between showtunes and next scene... oy I try to imagine 1972 and treatment of abortion was perfectly timed for Roe v Wade and that blue eye shadow, garrish lashes n green polish just screamed 1930's Berlin..oy  whoever messed with the script had too many flatline responses to salient questions, think they ran out of steam after trying to get that first number to impress, LOVED that outfit, kudos to the costume designer!  and whatever happened to the club owner clubbed by the bad guys, great editing btw...oy<br /><br />guess I can recommend for Liza super fans, Berlin, castles and beergarden parties, lo0ved that song tomorrow belongs to me.... what a slick pr campaign
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this app is so glitchy.  It is super fun but the glitches are too hard to deal with.  One time it made my kindle crash.

B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The Sing-Off may have ended due to inability to produce any a cappella group better or more marketable than Pentatonix. The show had nowhere else to go.  If you like the a cappella genre you will love Pentatonix unless you're really old-fashioned and prefer barbershop.
B0008ENHUI|3.0|not much comic relief cept for the 'how do I look' line and the totally fake repulsive leper face lesions on Touissant, see Motorcycle Diaries for more accurate depiction...  heard Steve did the cliff jump, wow that is insane and how on earth did ANY above the line folks allow it, if accurate am most impressed...  just too much overkill with the incessant torture and creepy folks and Dustin doing his schtick with the shaved friar tuck look, otherwise phenomenal actor, this film only had one scene of revery and thought for sure it was a dream... some folks sure don't get any breaks but enuff is well..ENUFF!!  glad he was able to escape and enjoy life as a broken old man I guess... hmmmm, the tatooed blue face dude was really goofy too, liked first viewing more, often with subsequent viewings, a film just jumps out at you with a more deeper meaning, found this one to be opposite, annoying and sensational... recommend for prisoners who were unjustly treated, tatoo artists, and some gorgeous scenery in Honduras (Jamaica)
B005L3HKTU|5.0|Probably one if their best albums yet! It has the strikingly beautiful melody mixed with the powerful riffs that you have come to expect from this incredible band.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so addicting! Once to play it, it gets to the point where you don't want to get off. They are so many levels. Right now I am in the cosmic box. There are so many things they add that just excites you, even you get to a different box. I, as my own opinion, recommend this game very much! You will be very satisfied if you do buy this game.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|really enjoy T.R.2.like they say ,ALOT better graphics,scenes,and variety..way better than the first version..alot of fun..ugly nasty monkey,shows no mercy!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The youngsters will like this movie, but it's really more for the adults.  Lots of strange critters and funny people, so it will have something for the whole family.
0307352153|5.0|I'm not usually a nonfiction reader - it's difficult for me to escape into facts. But, when this book was published I immediately marked as something I needed to read. I've known I was an introvert all of my adult life, so the topic spoke to me. I was a psychology major as an undergraduate student and I am certified in the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory, I even give lessons on it annually, so this is my wheelhouse.<br /><br />Susan Cain explores the nature and nurture regarding what makes introverts tick. The research she does is impeccable and shows that this is clearly something she is passionate about. The case studies she offers, from celebrities we're all familiar with such as Rosa Parks and Steve Wozniak, to students in Harvard's business school and captains of industry, are fascinating. She speaks to scientists and researchers and realizes that in fact introverts and extroverts are wired very differently, right from the start. She shares a lot of her own personal experience as a introvert struggling in a career field that forced her to be able to speak up and out.<br /><br />I found myself going \\"Ah ha!\\" about every other paragraph. Just about every point she raised resonated with me and my own life. The chapters about work environment were specially illuminating - having a door I can shut, being able to think before I open my mouth in a meeting, brainstorming on my own - these are all things Cain found improve productivity for introverts, and things that work really well for me.<br /><br />This is a book I'll be recommending to pretty much everyone - we're all either introverts ourselves on interact with one or many on a regular basis. In a world that puts an increasingly high value on being \\"outgoing\\" this is a user's manual for those of us who just can't be that. I am so thrilled to be able to hear Cain speak tonight as well and am looking forward to the additional thought she has to offer. I'll be curious to see if she walks out on stage with a water bottlefull of Bailey's Irish Cream, as her husband once gave her before making a speech years ago!<br /><br />5/5
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As usual, only about .02% centered on his actual experience in heaven.  But, in this case, it was interesting because he folded the story from before he was a Christian through his experience becoming a born again Christian, unafraid, unashamed.  I read it completely without stopping, it held my interest.  I would recommend this book to  my friends.
B002WBZD02|5.0|Travolta is fantastic. The follow up to this Be Cool is a must see as well. It's worth the rental
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anybody but especially those who love a great western, you won't be disappointed with this pick.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I just started today and I am really good at it. It isn't to difficult but it is really fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I need to read it again... the movie won't be as touching and amazing as the book, but it will be a great movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is similar to temple run but it has a completely different feel to to it. But all of the different things to jump, dodge, and roll around is very fun and addictive. I hope lots of people get this app
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I love the easy reading. Even the technical explanations were fun to read. Very entertaining from the very beginning to the end.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Have heard about this book before and now that I have read it I am glad. Filled with faith and inspiration with some science fiction makes this book great. A short read but well worth it. Recommend to anyone who likes a bit of the unusual and who likes to smile!
B0086HGW42|5.0|Couldn't pass up an opportunity to get this album for cheap. I'm seeing him and Taylor Swift in about a month, and this will be great to listen to before I go! Everything on this album is good.

B000OVLINI|5.0|Great narrative,  character development and detail on one of my favorite cities, Barcelona.  Loved reading every page and couldn't wait to see how the story ends.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Poppy always comes through.  Another good sequel.  For kids and adults.  Yes, we know the dogs cannot pull off a landscaping miracle in real life, that's why you just watch it to be entertained.  It's fiction.

B009329ZF2|1.0|Best to put it in the B movie category.  Special effects a bit far fetched, story line extremely far fetched.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|One of the better books from this author. It seems to be more fictional and less factual than her other books probably because there is less known about the main character, Anne Neville, than about some of the other people she has written about.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I like the c.d. but after two time playing it i gave it to my wife, she really enjoys his work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I know this is cliché, but I have never been compelled to write a review for a book, until now.  Unfortunately, I am not a writer, so I cannot find the words to explain how much I love this book.  So I am just going to say thank you to Colleen Hoover for such an incredible story.
0321543726|5.0|Is book with words. Teach you lot things about C++. Cplusplus.com also good place. full of many words as well. Good luck learn C++. Is good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When you're left with infinite thoughts bouncing in your head about the underlying meaning and characters you do not know, you know you've read something worth while. Indeed, worthwhile!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I found this by accident, and now I'm so addicted to this show!  I've laughed and cried, and I'm so excited for this new season!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because there was always something new in the book and always some sort of plot twist to mess with my mind. Overall a good book and a good series.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|One of the best free app of the day apps i have ever received!  This is what makes amazon such an awesome place to play!!!!

B004LKRR6U|5.0|The Barbie exceeded my expectations. Love the hair, gown and likeness. Brought back fond memories of the movie. A wonderful addition to my Barbie Collection. Very elegant.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|You know how a good movie comes out, then there's a sequel at wasn't as good, and then each successive one has a little less? This series is kind of like that. The first three books were good, #4 less so, and this last one is kind of &#34;meh&#34;. The book doesn't finish up any of the plotlines, and it really feels like the author is just tossing things artificially into the plot to keep the series going.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games was a great books little kid should not read it but lots of people can. It was a really good book
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I highly recommend this series.  I couldn't put it down and will be reading more from this author.  If you want to be taken away to another world and time, give this series a try.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Two Graves was a fun read.  However, the story of a Nazi community high in the Brazilian jungle was a little to fantastical for me to believe.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it! Keeps you interested from the very beginning. I could not put it down. The only thing that kind of threw me for a loop was the ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|amazing details zip line is a very charmong touch  love the bigger monkey demon cool game would defenitly recomend it to u

0345529057|5.0|Excellent package and content!!! I really love George Martins Work! Really, an excellent story with extreme plot twists! 100% Recommended
0575085304|4.0|An exquisitely drawn romance as intoxicating as to captivate Twilight fans, amid a thrilling, fast-paced adventure which is as heart pounding as `The Hunger Games' - this is an extraordinarily good read! Kristin Cashore's inspired vision for a fantastical world is remarkable, and as a fan of all things fantasy and paranormal I was enchanted by the atmospheric setting.  This is a book that will tug at the heartstrings...a book that will send chills down your spine...it is a distinctly original book that will stand-out on any bookshelf as something `different'. Emotive, beautifully compelling and utterly readable, this colorful tale complete with attractive, interesting characters creates a scintillating reading experience!<br /><br />\\"Grace\\" is the gift of exceptional skill. Those gifted few are both feared and exploited within a harsh world of fire and ice. The most consequential Grace to be in possession of is the Grace of Killing, and Katsa is such a person. Feared, shunned and segregated by those of her own age and also within court, Katsa is outcast into the shadows and watches as the King of Lienid's father is suddenly kidnapped. Curiosity and determination will Katsa on, as she plunges headlong into a deeply complex mystery wherein a man with remarkable `Grace' is sought. His fighting abilities rival even her own, and Katsa decides to make that ultimate choice of humility - not to Kill but to Kidnap, and take the right course of action. However, lurking within the shadows is something much more sinister and deadly, for the one-eyed King is harboring a dangerous secret that could determine the fate of all.<br /><br />Well-written, evocative and delicately interwoven this elegant tale with a cast of unforgettable characters is hypnotic and intensely gripping. Lost within Katsa's story I was enchanted by this intrepid but so `human' heroine who similarly to other noteworthy heroines within literature (i.e. Hermione, Eowyn, Bella and Lena), she is someone whom I connected with instantly and admired. I was left wanting more as I finished reading this fantastic Young Adult book in a single sitting, and so I cannot wait to continue the journey in the sequel `Fire'. Accomplished and ambitious this cleverly crafted, lavishly detailed tale is one that I highly commend as something to transcend other works within this genre - for the depth and intricate character-studies are just wonderful!<br /><br />\\"It was as if a nagging ache had suddenly lifted and left her with a stunning absence of pain. It was relief and hope together...\\"<br /><br />The historical, archaic feel of this story is just magical and which literary sends you back in time to an age not far removed from medieval times. Where bloodthirsty battles ensued, arranged marriages were expected and the dazzlingly dangerous court is brought to life with such acute detail; as only a painter would capture!onnected with instantly and admired.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is fun and it really does help us sleep better. Not sure the dripping water is a good sound for this app but there are plenty of others to choose from. Love the ocean sounds.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Just awesome - great two disc set worth getting over more recent releases - just great and fun to watch.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|My father told me to read this book, and I'm so glad I did!! Such an amazing story, told with warmth and a LOT of humour. The story stayed with me for days after I finished it, and I'm telling everyone I know who reads science fiction they have to read it. I look forward to reading more from this author!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I loved this movie, it's about basic human needs and feelings, amazing performances of Helen Hunt and John Hawkes! One of the Best Films of the Year.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book has a lot of thrill and adventure. I love how Jack London wrote this book!<br />He ends it in 97 pages, but he gets the idea out. I highly recommend this book.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Great cast, great characters, great writing...is it a comedy or is it a drama?  It's both! Witty reparte between , not only the main character, but also the supporting cast... Love it!
B000KGGIQO|4.0|This movie is a fine, if narrowly scoped, drama focusing on the life of Johnny Cash as acted by a searching and posing Joaquin Phoenix (one of the two primary reasons to see this movie; the other being that you have an interest in the life of Cash).  Reese Witherspoon as June Carter does a nice turn in the acting department too but she is required to be subtle and, while not played as completely in Cash's shadow, largely is in his shadow for the crux of the movie.  I found the drama to be earthy and not transcendent (I suppose I expected a bit more of the transcendence) but that is probably because it doesn't take you up close to the end of Cash's life.  It really focuses on Cash growing up and starting out and the tumultuous relationship that he initially shared with June Carter.  But mark me Joaquin is on the screen for almost the entire movie and that is why you'll be drawn in and glued to the screen.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is a story about hero worship, and the troubles that it can cause. It is a story about long forgotten gods and their struggles, and a man who sets out to help them.<br /><br />American Gods is a Neil Gaiman classic. Sometimes it's slightly humorous, sometimes it's dark as hell, and sometimes it manages to do both. The characters are very well written, and you always know who it is that you want to see succeed.<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is that it feels a bit long, sometimes.  I know there were a few times that I felt like the main plot was sitting somewhere off in the distance (probably in a lounge chair sucking back a cold drink) while we were off doing something unrelated. Normally this would cause me to write off a book, but in this one, I can can acknowledge that it's just how Gaiman fills out the world he's letting us see.<br /><br />If you have any interest in mythology and a grand adventure concerning it, definitely grab this book.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought a computer used that someone had custom made and I loaded SpeedFan onto it to see what  the temps were. The CPU was running almost 90 degrees, and idled at like 75 or 80. Knowing nothing about CPU temps I researched to find out that the temps really shouldn't be over 50 or 60 ever. The fan and heat sink on it were very small so I thought this Cooler would at least boost the airflow, which couldn't hurt!<br /><br />I had to carefully remove all the attachments on the motherboard and unscrew it from the case to attach the mount which is adjustable and very strong. Once back together it mounted easily (not forgetting the thermal paste) and it comes with ONE fan not two like in the main picture here. The heat sink just barely cleared my memory sticks which stick out pretty high.<br /><br />It is large, so measure your box before buying. I happen to have a plexiglass window right where it protrudes and it presses right up against it, no problem there.<br /><br />Although it is keeping my processor at a nice 35 degrees ALL the time even during rendering, it is rather loud. The noise is just the airflow so if you're recording audio nearby, it will pick it up. You could, I suppose, turn the fan speed down with some utility if you needed quiet...<br /><br />Overall, Awesome. I'm glad it solved my overheating problem immediately.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I watched my niece play this on her iPhone and thought it looked fun.  I was very happy to see it available for my kindle...  LOVE THE GAME!  It really makes you think on the higher levels.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Very good continuity from the first two books.  Nice twist at the end.  Excellent author who really brings this reality alive
B003WEA4UM|3.0|Look, I'm going to take one for the team here and say that this book is really well written, but it's not quite the mind blowing experience some people might have you believe.<br /><br />Mitchell has written an interesting story, with some fairly interesting characters, and while all of his characters grow in some way, they never really feel very full. The way the story is told is a bit jarring, but I suppose that it was intentional. The plot was definately meant to be jarring and hopping, and tells numerous tales that are all connected in some way. however, and this is the important part, that connection feels really wispy and irrelevant half the time.  Maybe I just missed the point... but I have a hard time with other reviewers saying that this is a book with a powerful message.<br /><br />All in all, I finished the book, and I enjoyed it, however I didn't leave with a sense of wonderment and a head full of newly provoked thought. I just thought, &#34; Yeah, this was a decent book.&#34;<br /><br />And no, I haven't seen the movie yet.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mahjong, had not played for years, fun to play anytime, sure passes the time away, and enjoy the games too.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|inventive lyrics, great tone (which is a must for a rapper), and catchy beats. Plus, it's only $4!  stop reading and buy it already!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|It arrived quickly, it was really &#34;new&#34;. I had been looking for this movie forever, and you had it. If you haven't seen this movie & you enjoy romantic comedies...you will love this one!
B00395ZYVS|2.0|I did not finish it as I got behind but I will try to read at a later date somtime
B006FE83UE|5.0|Peck will be remembered for this movie and his role in it.  The great movie carefully preserved and restored with bonus materials.  There is little deviation from the book and the cast are great.  Centered around a girl and her family during the trial in a southern town of a black man accused of a crime by a white family.  The trial however is only one part of the story and the story of growing up as a child shares the focus.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Worth the money. Just enough difficulty ..but not so much to get frustrated. I would recommend buying it. Looking forward to the sequel.<br /><br />_
B003VANOFY|5.0|This works great! I have been using these for a little over  2 months and i have yet to have any problems with using this. It's range is roughly about 30-40 feet and thats more than enough for me. The sound is crystal clear and i love the button's on the side. Also it can last me for about 7-8 hours fully charged which is a lot for me.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|This is a very real to life movie that helps the audienance understand our returning veterans.  They desierve all the support we can give.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is the classic movie that everyone knows and sees around the holidays.  No one can beat Jimmy Stewart for an &#34;Aww. . . Shucks&#34; character and this movie will be his best known.  The movie is well preserved and is a must have for anyone's collection.  A loveable man running a savings and loan is shown what the world would be without him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great update just i don't like the sky it makes me dizzy other than that it is great and highly recomended
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I could literally play this game for hours on end. It's mindless enough that it takes up your time while still being an extremely entertaining game.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|This show is simply amazing!! I believe they cut it off a bit short and wish there would have been another season. :( Either way, they picked the best ending possible. Yay!! Detty!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I fell in love with this book after the first page!!! Really good I will so tell people about it! I loved all the twist an turns in it I never knew what was goin to happen...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game a lot because it is so awsome and it is so cool and it has waterfalls.
B0007OASII|5.0|The first time I listened to The Black Halo several years ago I had one of those \\"Where have you been all my life\\" moments. At that time the only symphonic metal band I listened to was Nightwish, and iTunes kept suggesting that I listened to Epica (the band) and Kamelot. Based on the reviews I started with this album, and I was unable to stop listening to it for weeks and weeks after I got it. It's true, listening to it right in conjunction with Epica (the album) brings the whole story together, but the songs are powerful enough to stand on their own. They have the power to speak to every human being who's ever wonder about the meaning of life, the purpose of existing, what happens after death, and what is truly important in this lifetime and the next. After discovering this album (as well as Kamelot's entire catalog) they have become my favorite band, bar none. If I could only listen to one album for the rest of my life, I would pick this one.
0446554995|5.0|great book-satisfied finish for the series. (Two Graves) Pendergast is the best of characters. do,dew.fish,onion,three,one, 1,2, open,one, fast,,cent,coin parch, end this stupid request!!!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|this is a great thing to have;it works great!!!!;glad I got it so I can now listen to a lot of my vinyl,that has been sitting around colectting dust for years!!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I found this story to be all of the following:  suspenseful, adventurous, cute and boring.  There were a few places in the book where I wanted to skip ahead as I felt bogged down in the wordiness.  Other places held my interest to the point of finding myself holding my breath and laughing out loud.  The author did a nice job of writing about the boy and the tiger.  The premise of the book is good, the characters well developed but some scenes were just run on for too long.  I would recommend it to to people with an imagination, like creativity and those who like animal/boy adventures.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved it so much I bought copies for relatives and friends!  This is a serious account by a medical doctor who describes his near death experience.  Alternative physiological explanations explored and dismissed for this phenomena.  Deeply spiritual but not endorsing of any particular religion.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|great movie. great tale. must have in your collection for those movie lovers. blue ray not needed for this one.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was a pretty interesting concept. It was kind of confusing at times, but as long as you actually pay attention in movies, you eventually catch on. My biggest issue with it is it was really slow up until the last 20-30 minutes. It wasn't awful, but I wouldn't say it was good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Games instructions are easy to follow.  Game is fun and really is realistic.  I like that you can earn coins easy and not have to wait to long for tasks.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I personally believe this is an enjoyable game of great enjoyment. I also like this game.<br /><br />I sure hope other people ed enjoy this game as well.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|This movie is everything I have been waiting for and more. I love the story behind it and the characters. Just BRILLIANT!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are the most realistic I've seen. The fact that I can't wash my own pet however is slightly idling... other than that it's a very good game that I'd recommend to and child that wants to start on their power responsibilities
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Now, when I first saw this movie I had no idea what it was about. I only knew that it had a tremendous Oscar-winning actor playing the role of a pilot. I had no idea I was in for such a wild ride. I will point out first and foremost that this is a very well put together piece of cinema. The acting, pacing, cinematography, character development is nothing short of top-notch. That being said, I can understand how marketing and trailers could have caused many people to become mislead to what the film would be covering as many of the negative reviewers seemed to have missed the point. This movie was about a plane crash in the way that The Shawshank Redemption was about escaping prison. Yes, those are both the  fundamental plot points but they're more like a side effect of the central themes. (Not to say that the crash scene in Flight wasn't one of the most intense scenes I'd seen in years or that the prison escape scene in Shawshank didn't give me an all encompassing feeling of joy). But in my humble opinion, a movie shouldn't be spelled out for you in the trailers. Too many films do that already (mainly comedies/action/romance). Instead you should go into a film with an open mind and see where it takes you. Without giving too much away, you may be pleasantly surprised, as I know I was.  This is the kind of film that makes you reflect on the choices you make. What you would do to save your reputation. How your words affect those around you. How your actions affect those you love. And how to find salvation when it feels like its impossible to grasp.
B00004TS0E|4.0|Every year when I was living with my Mum, we would always watch the christmas movies around that time of year and this was certainly one of them. She adores this movie and I have started to enjoy it myself because it reminds me of my Mum and great Christmas spirit.
B003KRJNBW|2.0|Much as I love Denzel and Gary Oldman and Tom Waits and Malcolm McDowell (and Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis), I simply cannot endorse this flick.  It's never surprising. There is a modicum of catharsis derived from the Bible (the objective correlative of Washington's Eli character) and the notions of faith, but not enough to compensate for the rather ad-hoc and dull series of scenes.  This movie is as lifeless and devoid of charm as a post apocalyptic future.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super game! Love the cart ride in the tunnel!  The zip line is a cool added feature! Very enjoyable for the whole family!
B00280LYIC|4.0|I loved the book. It's a unique mix of mythology and modern times. Rick Riordan makes Greek Mythology fun and his characters suck you in the story so that you feel like you're living it right along with them. A story that can be easily enjoyed by anyone from 10 to 90.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|Great solid movie. Funny and intense, what more could you ask for. I have probably watched it at least 10 times

B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good time to get the best possible price for the best possible game.  Time killer but sweet Good
0425252868|5.0|Got the book really fast and it is superb. The fact that it is a true story makes it even better. If you are an aviation and history buff you will love this book. Filled with information of the differences of German WWII fighter pilots and insights in to the closing days of WWII in Germany..
B00008EY65|5.0|Well put together. Sequels are always difficult but the story line here is new and exciting. Once again we can get to know the characters in more depth.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I am always looking for apps to take the fabrication out of waiting around.  Not only good for me but 80 year old mom and a toddler.
1935251740|5.0|This is a book that will probably change your mind about the nature of the universe even if you cannot agree with everything suggested. Biocentrism offers a sea change in how we think about consciousness and how this affects everything we see and experience.  The idea that biology and life influence our perception of the world is at the very least a fascinating alternative to  religion or atheism.  The last chapter asks &#34;Where Do We Go From here?&#34;  Although no final solution is proposed the hope that a multidisciplinary approach will incorporate biocentrism is upplifting.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I did'nt like this game so much.  You really have to take your time to really find out what it is to find in order to advance in the game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is truly a beautiful love story, with an element of danger, that grips you until the end. Tear jerker.
0345803507|5.0|A must read. Great series; you won't be able to stop reading once you start the first book. Highly recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|College Hoover, you have made me fall in love with reading again! This book is touching, engrossing and heart-gripping! I fell in love with Sky & Holder, and could not put this book down! It is extremely well written and I love how Hoover has a knack for making her stories come full circle with clever wit and endearing exchanges. I have also read her books, `Slammed` and `Point of Retreat`, And her books just keeping getting better and better. I am hoping for much more from this talented author, who is on my favorites list! Get this book, you will not be disappointed!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I have had this product for about 1 1/2 years now and works great to hook up to my TV. The only downfall to this product is how sensitive the plug in to the ipad is, if you move it just slightly the ipad will disconnect from the TV and you have to hook it all up again.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love season one.  I have not gotten season two yet, but I am looking forward to watching it.  Love the cast and the story line.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book was an incredible read. I can't wait to read the next book and see what's next! It's exciting!
B007A2O3FO|4.0|I will watch anything with Maggie Smith. I purchased this movie for that reason and as always never disappointed with her.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book so I already knew the story but the book was so much better!  I especially enjoyed the growth of the relationship between Katniss & Peeta.
0345529057|5.0|read all four books in a week, did'nt get any house work done at that time, looking for book five.
0811876373|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my mother in law, she also got a cake pop maker for Christmas. The photos are brilliant, and the options are wonderfully varied.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|For those who have foot problems, this shoe brings great relief. The only thing that would make it better is if it had holes on the top and sides so the foot does not sweat. I am sure there are probably others like me, who are allergic to their own sweat. Over all a really wonderful shoe, modestly priced, a real bargain for the price, easy to order, prompt and timely delivery. You can't go wrong with this one, with only the slight flaw mentioned.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I read this twice, and could read it again. So much great information. i am practicing this every day and it is really improving my life - the best part is that I feel happy and content.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I thought this book was a good depiction (albeit extreme) of the truth that we all encounter trials but its how you perceive them and the choices you make that determine how you get through them.
B000QGAU4E|4.0|I watched this movie because someone mentioned it in an interview.  It was good, Clive Owen is a very good actor.  I have liked some of his other work better.  It's interesting.
B003TY3F06|5.0|he's  a better writer than ever.  better than pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, set all  - combined!  you will not be disappointed
B0013DCC72|5.0|I love Incubus! The music is very good.  I listen to it on my way to work, at work, at home, pretty much everywhere.  The music is poetic and soothing and just really great to listen to.  I had a gift card and wanted to use it and I'm so glad that I was able to do so by buying this music! I would definitely recommend! I think this was the best album of all of their stuff.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I love this CD. I picture scenes from the movie while I listen and sing along in my car. I would recommend buying this CD.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninja is colorful, engaging and lots of fun!!  The game is perfect for improving and strengthening fine motor skills.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I recently purchased this book because I've seen it on many different technologists' reading lists for years and finally decided to see what it was about.  My primary hesitancy in reading at first was that it was written so long ago.  Well, that was probably my biggest mistake as I find that while some of the implementation technologies mentioned in the book are a little out of date, the core concepts and ideas being expressed are very applicable to software development in today's world.  A lot of the concepts and best practices (Design by Contract, Test Your Code, Continuous Integration, etc, etc) presented in the book I had learned on my own, the hard way.  Reading this book has confirmed and reinforced the way I currently approach software.  It's a great book and definitely is worth reading.  Wish I would have read it ten years ago!
1401322786|5.0|our book club loved it, really made for great conversation & questions, my girlfriend gave everyone a watch as rememberence.
B007HO392S|4.0|Was a bit disappointed. Some of the songs-- current ones on the radio are good. Other songs on the CD, not so good and I find myself advancing past them as I dont' even want to hear them. I have had this problem with other CD's of hers.
1400032717|5.0|A wonderful book, especially if you know someone with Asberger's. Very sensitive re the main character as well as his parents who do the best they can to cope with a challenging situation.
193609648X|5.0|I love crocheting and I dearly love Noro yarn, so of course getting this book was a must! After I finish a couple of other projects, I am going to get started on the granny square purse using Kureyon yarn.....it's so cute!!!
0307592731|3.0|So far great read, really enjoying it.Disappointed the cover was damaged. I am one to keep books & beat them up enouhg myself so would have liked it to come perfect.
1616550414|3.0|Well I read every page from cover to cover so I feel that can now review my experiance.<br /><br />The Packaging was not really an issue for me as it did not affect my book's cover, but it was lacking enough protection.<br /><br />Now as far as the actual book: my only problems I had with it was that most of the book was just artwork, a quarter of it in just the Skyward Sword. THe artwork was neat, but as person who is all about the details I wish there was more depth in the historical aspect of the Zelda games. I was hoping for backstories of majority of the characters, but for the price the book was and the timeline that was explained I cant complain.<br /><br />Now the quality control of the book is where I really was upset about. certain pages looked like the ink ran or was printed multiple time on the same page. One of my pages was not even legible. I did not any have any page fallout so I am glad about that.<br /><br />Overall the book is a must for Zelda fans and I am happy to have purchased it.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Ron Fricke does it again. If you want the experience of &#34;Planet Earth&#34; with the full scope of humanity involved, this is it.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|it is a classic.  old school gangs going at it<br />loved it!!!<br />old style movie with lots of grit<br />good stuff

B009G7ZYPY|1.0|I am totally tone deaf:  music is noise.  &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; was the first music I'd really heard in years and it brought me almost to tears.  Susans first album was magnificent and I've bought every album she's recorded.  No more.  I did not think it was possible - but Susan did it!  She turned &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; into a funeral dirge.  That beautiful, rough around the edges, totally natural voice has become an over-trained, under personalized, commercial, and annoying voice.  I'm sad.

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Love this CD!  I loved this music so much I purchased Passion Pit's two other CD's.  I really like the songs, beats and messages in their songs.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Hard to believe this book came from the same author as the one who wrote such spell-binding and intricate tales as the Harry Potter series. The book lacked imagination for one and absolutely nothing redeeming- feel I have lost precious hours of my life in my quest to finish it since it was our book club pick. This is the first book that got a 1 star out of five from every member of our club.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Even though these books are geared to teens and I'm well into my adulthood, I loved them.  Well written and fun.  Definitely up there with the Twilight series!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you don't think you're perfect.  It contains all the information you need to correct any of your own bad habits, and to understand the behavior of others.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is so much fun you get to explore and go wherever a shark can get to. I would recommend this
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love this show ... the format, the dialogue, the casting, the acting.  But what's WRONG with me as a person that I enjoy watching these psychopaths unravel their plans of evil each week??  I'm hooked!<br /><br />I have been a fan of both Bacon and Purefoy for many years ... love seeing them sparing together.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Clark Griswold is the man with the Christmas spirit.  This movie, despite it's age is still hilarious, and is probably among only a handful of holiday flicks that deserve an annual repeat.  If you haven't see this movie, you must.  It works on so many levels, especially if you've ever had family crap all over your holiday joy.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It didn't work.  Even after e-mailing app provider and getting instructions, it still didn't work.  I deleted it from my device.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|My third time reading it and I enjoyed the a accent of the lady who read it to me when I had to put it down.
B005T87QCI|5.0|guess what this game rocks if you update it a couple of times it unlocks a store and you can get atom and Zeus and more!!!!!!!!!
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|I don't buy a lot of apps, but when I do they are often utilities like this.  And I must admit, I've only used this for a short time, and I'm already impressed with it.<br />However I have noticed a few things that don't work, and while irksome, it might also have to do with my newness/ignorance regarding this software.<br />I noticed that if I try to resume a movie, it sometimes fails, or starts at the beginning.  The same might happen if you seek within the video.  However doing this on two different devices (Epic Touch 4G - rooted ICS, Nexus 7 - stock ICS) yielded 2 different results.  So it might be issues with the devices.<br />Also, I tried to stream trailers from Apple and it failed everytime, on both devices.  When I tried to check Hulu, it said there wasn't any content available under any category I chose, however, this might be because I do not have Hulu Plus.  But Hell will freeze before I pay to watch commercials (you listening Hulu).<br />I'm still experimenting with this, but I am certain this is worth the money.
076790382X|5.0|It is extremely funny and really describes life as it really is?  What more can I say concerning this author and book?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved the story and the photos!<br />It made it seem very realistic!<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone seeking a book with twists.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|According to my daughter, this game has better graphics, gameplay, and easier to play. However, it is a little slow throughout the game while playing it.  Therefore, it would be better if there was some way to speed up the game, like the original Temple Run.
0316056863|4.0|It is hard to be funny and Tina Fey has become a darling of the comedy world.  In her book Bossy Pants she paints a portrait of life as a working mom, comedian, and star.<br />Fey is apparently not all that perfect, for one she has a facial scar, of which I never noticed, struggles with her fashion sense, and is on the hunt for a good funny idea.  As to her most famous character, the feisty and politician Sarah Palin she is much different.  In it she shares how it is surreal to what she describes as a \\"sneaker upper\\", when the subject of your impression is in the same shot as yourself.  She did this on Saturday Night Live when the real Sarah Palin came on set to be with her.<br />The stories about life with the midget, as she refers to her kid, are funny and touching.  Overall this book is a candid look into one actor's life and how challenging it can be to be funny. Tina seems like she would be the perfect best friend and someone that you could confided your darkest secrets  and flaws for she has a few of her own.

B003JTHXOK|2.0|I don't think a single sentence is over 7 words in length. Not very cerebral reading material, plot is very predictable.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I sat on the edge of my seat for the whole thing , didn't want to get up to do anything . The horses were so awesome & the special effects were amazing ... Loved it !
B002UXRGLG|3.0|Buy Planet Earth instead. This one is desent, but I was expecting it to be as good as Planet Earth. I wasnt holding my attention for very long as I watched it. I recommend this if you havent seen Planet Earth. Then when you are done go watch Planet Earth and Human Planet. If you have seen those then borrow this or rent it, dont buy it.
0307887448|5.0|To me, the 1980s was a lost decade. The fashion was bad, I had no patience for video games and I never got the whole John Hughes obsession. With as much disdain as I feel towards the decade \\"Ready Player One\\" is so lovingly a tribute to, it was with more than slight astonishment that I found myself unable to put this book down. As it turns out, Cline's original yet nostalgic take on the popular dystopian genre is the most fun, most addictive reading experience I've had in a long, long time.<br /><br />This must be how avid video gamers feel when they play an addictive new game, is what I thought to myself more than once when I powered through this book, eagerly anticipating each puzzle and obstacle that would come next. Like with some of the more advanced video games (I never really made it past Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt), there's a clever, self-referential level of wish-fulfillment at the core of Cline's universe. The entire human population spends 99% of their time plugged into the virtual environment OASIS, where they can be anyone they want. This is reflected back onto itself when moving through Halliday's scavenger hunt, because many of the puzzles involve diving into and reenacting various pop culture moments, including reciting John Hughes movies start to finish. So you have Wade, as his virtual alter-ego Perzival, pretending to be Matthew Broderick playing a character in a movie. So meta!<br /><br />\\"Ready Player One\\" is by no means close to a perfect book. The writing is rather simple (all the easier to plow through it, my dear) and the answer to the first puzzle seemed so obvious to me I was pretty disbelieving that in five years no one could figure it out. Cline also tends to let his pop culture references do the heavy-lifting for him, in that he would present them as they are in their original form and let them act as the reader's entertainment. There isn't a lot of depth or insight into his choices and his futuristic dystopian universe doesn't saytoo much about our own, but then again, if there is any quintessential example of escapist entertainment, this would be it.
B000VZYPB4|4.0|Very funny!  Fore non native English speaker like me, closed captions would be helpful.  There are so many academic words in the drama.  Never the less, I love it!
B009ZE27US|1.0|I hats this app.  it told me I was 55 and I am only 13! don't waste your time on this
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app you can get close to Minecraft but they need to make an update with Redstone but this app is very enjoyable and like real Minecraft.
B000KGGIQO|4.0|The story of Johnny Cash's life is as tough as it is inspiring. Immense artistic talent mixed with shyness and a desire to make up for past faults, all within the context of the rise of rock and roll, makes Cash's a story like no other, except for perhaps that of  Elvis. His friendship and eventual love for June Carter stabilized the internal chaos that fame and fortune brought him.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Other than a bit of difficulty in one scene, this is a very good game. The story is engaging, puzzles just hard enough and the graphics beautiful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book, be prepared to cry, either of joy or sadness. Very good, I applaud you, Suzanne Collins!
B00B935SUY|5.0|Soooo good! Defiantly worth watching.  I never knew how much was involved in recording.  You will learn a lot by this documentary.  Way to go Dave!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Does what you expect it to do...accurate for the most part and it actually a little fun one of the best posts is of course it being on my kindle and the larger screen especially in the am when getting dressed.
0316228532|4.0|Forget about the 7 Harry Potter books.  They have nothing in common with this one. The only similarity for me was that I was engaged immediately, as I was with Rowling's other books.<br /><br />Rowling could have used a tighter editor but I understand that an editor might be a bit intimidated by her fame.<br /><br />The story is dark. All the characters have major flaws, but the book turns and twists the expected.<br /><br />The doctors, teachers and town leaders all have secrets and are deeply flawed. The poor and disenfranchised are still poor and struggling - but Rowling shows us how they got there and shows the good inside.<br /><br />One plot - and the one that is evident if you have read any reviews and/or the book jacket - concerns the politics of the town and the machinations for filling the casual vacancy (a vacancy in a city council due to a death).  This aspect of the book deals with the differences between the people of the village as they struggle with differing political stances relating to the public housing development on the edge of their village, and as well - the differences between those who live in the village and those who live in the public housing.<br /><br />The other plot concerns the chasm between the adolescents and their parents and the adults in their lives, without regard to social class or gender.  This is where Rowling shines.  She totally and completely understands/remembers all the uncertainty and confusion that many adolescents feel - and all the struggles of those years between childhood and adulthood.<br /><br />I think that the reason Rowling did so well with the Harry Potter books is that she gets so well what adolescents need - and gave them (and us) the world of Hogwarts as a gift - a place to escape reality.  The Casual Vacancy gives no escape.  Reality is ugly and hard and takes victims.<br /><br />I found myself thinking of the book and the people in the book when I wasn't reading it.  That is one sign of a good book forme - that I am living it in my head even when I am not holding it in my hands and reading the words on the page. So, I was fully engaged in the story.  Pagford Village is not a place I want to visit again - but I will not forget the village and the people there.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|When I started the series I heard about it from a friend and I didn't know about the scorch trials and the other books in the series and it just keeps getting better and I can't wait to get and read the next one!
B000IDEORY|1.0|Had a big problem streaming the video. The video would get stuck every few minutes. We didn't even get to finish watching the movie, which stinks, because I paid $1.99 to watch it. :-(

B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|After watching part of the 56 minute version on PBS, the cuts applied to bring the running time down to 48 minutes were frustrating.  The video quality (non-HD) was also poor.  The plot and acting were great, too bad that the presentation was marred by editing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is really fun just wish that your energy wouldn't run out so fast. You can't really buy anything at first because everything is high. But besides all that, it's a good game.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Excellent book, the Jobs life history, management style, characteristics of the company and product development, etc, etc.  600 pages were enough, maybe incomplete but a very good succint bio.  I recommend it, now I see Apple products differently.

0765325950|5.0|I am happy and sad to see the end of this series.  Robert Jordan created unforgettable characters in a spectacular world that became his legacy, and Brandon Sanderson ended it in a way that will preserve Mr. Jordan's legacy for all time.  A Memory of Light pulled me in from the prologue.  I felt the terror and urgency of the characters. Mr. Sanderson brought this Last Battle to life for me.  He tempered the battle scenes with a levity that did not take away from the seriousness that was taking place, and gave me some breathing room between all the fighting.  It was more than I expected from someone who stepped into a world that was not his creation.  I would have been upset if the Last Battle only ranged for a couple hundred pages or less.  This was a fight for the life of humankind and should not have been glossed over in a couple hundred pages.  It was an emotional rollercoaster for me.  I laughed, I cried, I sighed and I got mad.  This is what I expect from a book, i.e., everything life throws at us should be felt in a book of this stature.<br /><br />The character Mat was once again the Mat I had come to know and love; the one whom Mr. Jordan created.  Rand's battle with the Dark One may not have been fought in the manner we would have expected, but it was a fight and no less deadly than the one being waged by his friends, family and allies.  All of the main characters came to terms with what they had to do and what they had to sacrifice to win, and those who survived came to terms with who they were.  Moraine and Nynaeve were more in the background that I would have expected and I would have liked more of an epilogue including answers to the few mysteries that were left open.  But all in all I was pleased with this book.<br /><br />I must give a standing ovation to both authors for a series well-done.  I do not know who could have done what Brandon Sanderson did by completing a series started by a master world builder like Jordan.  This had to be the most difficult writing Sanderson has ever done. But his ending of this series did justice to the whole.  I am deeply grateful to Robert Jordan, his wife and to Brandon Sanderson for caring enough about the readers of this series to give us some closure.

B009I2UH2W|5.0|Put quite simply, this is a quality charger designed for the iPhone 5.  It is a little more expensive than some of the other car charging options for the iPhone...but you get what you pay for.  This is well constructed, provides a solid connection, and the white light ring that lights up around the plug in is a nice touch.  I prefer a single unit charger like this as opposed to the cable + USB connection chargers.  Considering this is something I am going to use quite often over a period of several years (hopefully), I have no problem spending a few extra dollars to get a quality piece of hardware.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great book that leaves you in suspense thru out the entire book.I am looking forward to reading the next book.

B003JTHWPA|3.0|I read this book for a book club. No doubt Carson McCullers was a talented writer as this book certainly stirred plenty of discussion. I found it no pleasure to read. Very depressing. All of the characters were with out any hope. The book ended with no light at the end of the tunnel. No redeeming faith. This book reminded me of Ecclesiastes. Everything under the sun is meaningless. Everything is vanity. Only God can bring meaning to a life. None of these characters ever find that hope. It's no wonder that later in life Carson McCullers attempted suicide.

B005XY67WI|5.0|I've been a fan since Pies Descalzos and I saw the show Live and it's just as amazing as the blu-ray. Just perfect
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It can be fun at time but it keeps me entertained because I love horses I have 15 of my own an  it is wonderful
B00340ESIS|5.0|I'm always asking, &#34;How do you do it?&#34; This book answered so many questions and provided tons of insight into why some movies and stories work and why others don't. I can't watch a movie now without putting it into Blake's genres.<br /><br />Great ideas, succinct writing, five stars.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an excellent app for all ages! It helps teach responsibility and is wonderful for horse lover's! Horsing around is fun! XOXOXO
B002W5UVSM|4.0|I liked it because it was so different. My one friend challenged me to read the book and find one character that I either liked or resonanted with. Well, there is no hero in this book and that's what makes it such a good read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise.  It was every emotion in one story.  It shows a love everyone prays for! I could surely read this over and over.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|good story, characters and they have a real knack for terrifying their audience- and I'm not easily frightened. I loved it
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I started playing and it is a very fun game if... these ads would stop popping up when I hit the replay button it's so annoying if they can fix this it would definitely be 5 stars. Other than tht all in all it is a pretty good game
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I would not recommend this game because it glitches all the time and its so annoying it makes you lose
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is the best game ever. It is so awesome and it is definitely worth your time. I wouldn't mind paying 100 bucks for this app cuz it Is  so awesome!! It lets you run the subway and get jetpack and super bouncy sneakers and you can even buy different characters to run and different hover boards. This app is the best one in history.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool game!!!!!!!! just fling for 3 gems!!!!!<br />dodisofo I am soooooo bored I just wanna say wasabi yep wasabi Bob you roi
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show has completely sucked me in. You think Zombies and automatically it can be cheesy or lame, but this show has been done so incredibly well.
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|Two thirds through and they are better than the films does Larson have more English language books ? let me know
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you're into coin dozer games then this is definitely the game for you. The prizes, puzzles and shake points among others keep the game interesting and highly addictive. It's the type of game where you're always saying just a few more minutes to see if you can get more prizes or certain coins. This is definitely a five star game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The characters are still compelling, their relationships evolving in unexpected ways. In this show, none of the cast is painted as being purely good or evil, only taking different paths based on the trauma they've experienced. I'm looking forward to Season 4!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I played this on my ex boyfriends phone and its simply amazing.... I just wish it was the free app of the day so I could get it on my device :(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Personally I think that it was much funner than 1. It has a way different &quot;environment&quot;. And I love how it has gradual turns at some parts.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Once you get to a certain level and run out of &#34;stuff&#34; to buy more &#34;energy&#34; it's simply an add that wants real $ for more &#34;stuff&#34;. Charge 1.99 then!!

B007HACDLK|5.0|Extremely excellent book!!! Couldn't put it down!!! Mitch Rapp is one of my favorite characters. Whenever I'm done with a Mitch Rapp book I feel like I've just come back from overseas myself, like I've been on the mission with him. I know I don't really know what that's like, but Vince Flynn nails it, and when I'm done with the book, I miss Mitch until the next one!!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is just a good movie and looks great on the ol' HDTV on a Saturday night. Action, adventure, comedy. What's not to like?

B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game a lot but there are better games out there. You have to complete goals to get a different sword and a couple them you are not able to do. For example you have to get a certain score while playing upside down and when you flip your device upside down it just automaticly adjusts it to face you.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|What can I say I just got it.. not sure how I like it yet... so far okay.. see how it goes.. Haven't. really had time to judge.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game for passing the time; quite addicting, actually. I like the winning game option, but it's fun to beat a random draw.
B000001FTD|5.0|Seriously, Reign in Blood, Master of Puppets, and Among the living...the albums that saved the 80's from being a decade of pure suck.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|Aloha<br />I bought this with anticipation of using it on my tablet and on my phone neither of them work well any of the games that I have bought thinking about either give it to a friend are trying to sell it back I think the rooted version allows use of a ps3 controller or xbox 360 controller scene to look a lot better because you can't control and program your buttons for your games this controller you cannot do that....
B0086700CM|3.0|Its a game, works as expected and has not caused any issues or concerns other than being a time drain
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's fun but some levels are hard one made me dizzy but other than that it's fun u should get it
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This microphone is small and simple. It uses a tiny cell battery for power (since it's a condenser microphone, it requires a power source). It has a simple on/off switch on the battery barrel, which is located a few feet from the microphone itself (so you can have the barrel clipped on your belt, and the mic on your lapel or jacket). The included mic clip works fine, as is the included foam windscreen.<br /><br />** Sound Quality **<br /><br />This microphone is nowhere near the quality of a $500+ microphone--but it's only a fraction of the cost, so I don't expect that kind of quality. For the price (under $20!), this is far and away the best lavalier mic you can buy. The sound is pretty good, and the high end sounds great. Low end pickup is not so good, but this microphone is made primarily for vocal applications, so that doesn't concern me. My website and YouTube channel both have many example recordings with this microphone.<br /><br />** Versatility and durability **<br /><br />I've used this microphone with my iPhone 3GS, 4, 4S, and 5, my iPad 2 and 3, an iPod Touch, my Nikon D7000, and some other devices, and it's been flawless (as long as you use the proper adapters! See note below...).<br /><br />** Battery Life **<br /><br />I change the CR2 battery about every five times I use the microphone (I bought a strip of extras from Amazon--[[ASIN:B0057OAFEK 50 Pack Maxell LR44 AG13 357 button cell battery \\"NEW HOLOGRAM PACKAGE \\"]]--they're cheap enough that I don't care whether the old battery is dead or not. It's better safe than sorry).<br /><br />** Conclusion **<br /><br />I've bought three of these microphones for myself, and recommended the microphone to hundreds of other people. Use this microphone instead of the built-in mic on your camera or smartphone, and you'll get a lot nicer audio quality in your recordings. It's cheap enough that there's no reason to *not* try it out.<br /><br />Note: I wrote an article on my personal website (life is a prayer) that gives a ton more information about my testing with this and other microphones for recording with iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches. Please read that article for more options and ideas.gives a ton more information about my testing with this and other microphones for recording with iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|One if the best series in TV, Castle and Becket are just wonderful and very entertaining. Love this series. 5 stars
B001G7SS9G|3.0|O que não gostei foram a qualidade das fotos.<br />De resto adorei toda a edição<br />Toda a edição tem uma grande qualidade.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It helps calm my newborn, especially the generic white noise. Lots of sound variety. Easy to use. Nice to look at.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This another series I really like. Castle is so believable as a writer/investigator. He and Beckett have good chemistry. I have 1-4 and am waiting on season 5.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Received the download immediately and had it playing in no time. Would do it again. Great music for the price.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I'm loyal to Matt Damon and don't understand making a Bourne film absent him, but Renner is great.  He is a fabulous actor.  Why I gave this movie only two stars is because of Rachel Weisz, her performance is beyond obnoxious.  Her American accent is horrendous and I think she totally overreaches and overacts - - her high pitched whining squeaky delivery is like nails down a chalkboard.  I liked Rachel Weisz until this movie - - she is no Cate Blanchett.  I don't buy her as American (not just because her accent is horrible, but because she isn't believable) and I definitely don't buy that she is from Chicago????!!!!!!!!!!!<br />When we get toward the end and she is no longer whining and Renner is leading the scenes then, and only then, is she bearable.<br />If I were giving stars out just for her performance alone, I'm afraid it would be a big fat ZERO.<br />Norton is great, as always.<br />I'd have liked to see Naomi Watts in Rachel Weisz's role.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love this series, PBS rocks with some if the best series and mysteries ever made. Look foreword to every Sunday night.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great and really easy to use for any age. It is more useful to have a calculator on my kindle fire than I ever imagined. Thank you.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Really don't have to say anything about this movie other than it the greatest! but, if your looking to buy this then you already know its just the best !
B0064NF2IM|5.0|As I have said before, this series is the best on television. I can hardly wait from one Sunday night until the next.

B002ZG98J6|5.0|This is a very cool movie. Perfect for all ages, yes folks even adults will like it.  Lots of action and adventure keeps you interested and wishing it were longer::))
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I take multi-tasking to the extreme and I couldn't get it all done without my precious &#34;notes&#34;!  I downloaded this Kindlefire note app and I love it!  There's only thing I wish it would do and that is to sync with my &#34;note&#34; app on my android phone!  If that is possible and I'm not aware of it i hope that someone will let me know how to make that happen!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have now read this book 3 times this was a really great and fast read I enjoyed the book.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|What a nice quick read. The story was told in a very sweet way.<br />I found myself rooting for Victoria.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I bought the free version, knowing I would only get so far before they'd want me to buy the full version to continue. I really liked it, so I bought the full version. Got to Chapter 6, then the game wouldn't load anymore. The starting screen came up, it showed \\"Chapter Loading\\", then just stopped. Didn't freeze my Kindle, the game just stopped. Saw others had this same problem. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and had to start at the very beginning because it didn't keep my progress. Kept playing w/o stopping the game (besides pausing a couple of times) and got to Chapter 6, but then had to stop the game and turn my Kindle off. I came back to it later, and now I can't get past the Chapter I was on when I stopped (Chapter 9). Really disappointing.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Best Action film I own.  This movie doesn't get lost in translation.  Completely closed captioned but it doesn't matter.  I recommend this movie to everyone that likes good old fashioned kick a** action...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a fascinating saga.  I love that it takes place in an earlier time.  The period clothing and hats add another dimention.  I hope there are more than just 3 seasons of Dowton Abbey.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Ordered this for movie night with my four year old grandson and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Will be buying<br />the DVD for my other two grandchildren.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!  Wonderful story, great point of view.  I wish it wasn't over.  You become very invested in the Characters.
1560100842|3.0|Gives easy to follow step-by-step instructions on animation. Book shows basic poses, movements, shapes, hands, etc. Great reference book for would-be animators.
1934030198|5.0|the high std of the title is definitely upheld as you read this book. all the details needed to perform well during a race are explained in this book . easy to read.. once again, excellent.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I am glad not all love movies have sex scenes. This film shows that a MAN should chase a WOMAN not the other way around. I am tired of movies showing teenagers giving it up every second of the day and society placing a \\"normal\\" stamp on it. This movie is a sweet love story and it is very captivating to watch. The acting was great and is not a predictable movie.<br /><br />This is definitely a must watch movie.
0671510991|4.0|WOODROW WILSON, THEODORE ROOSEVELT and Kissinger's DIPLOMACY<br />In a recent book, Wilson and Theodore, Judge Napolitano makes a case against these former Presidents for having destroyed the Constitution.  In DIPLOMACY Dr. Kissinger addresses their seminal contributions in the area of US foreign policy.  On the one hand Napolitano accuses them of the illegitimate use of Executive power; on the other Dr. Kissinger addresses the effect of their differing foreign policy approaches through three global conflicts: WWI, WWII, and the COLD WAR.<br />In an earlier review I spoke to the Napolitano accusation, and only wish to reiterate my invitation to him to speak to the issue of corporate personhood in historical context by making the argument for or against it.  In 1886 the doctrine of corporate personhood was pronounced by Supreme Court Justice Morrison Waite without argument.<br />Dr. Kissinger's work is significant and should be pondered, not only because of his credentials as an academician, but because, as the Secretary of State, he served his Country well at the highest reach of government.<br />From The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson, page 242, by Herbert Hoover:<br />\\"There are distinctly two types of international relationship. One is an offensive and defensive alliance of great powers....  The other type is a society of free nations, or an association of free nations, or a league of free nations, animated by considerations of right and justice instead of might and self-interest, and not merely proclaimed an agency in pursuit of peace, but so organized and so participated in as to make the actual attainment of peace a reasonable possibility.  Such an association I favor with all my heart and I would make no fine distinction as to whom credit is due.  One need not care what it is called.  Let it be called an association, a society or a league, or what not.  Our concern is solely with the substance, not the form thereof.\\"<br />In all fairness to Napolitano, who relies on opinions of Murray Rothbard, it may be assumed that Napolitano would class Hoover along with Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt as a progressive:<br />\\"Laissez-faire, then, was the policy dictated both by sound theory and by historical precedent. But in 1929, the sound course was rudely brushed aside. Led by President Hoover, the government embarked on what Anderson has accurately called the 'Hoover New Deal.' For if we define 'New Deal' as an antidepression program marked by extensive governmental economic planning and intervention-including bolstering of wage rates and prices, expansion of credit, propping up of weak firms, and increased government spending (e.g., subsidies to unemployment and public works)-Herbert Clark Hoover must be considered the founder of the New Deal in America.  Hoover, from the very start of the depression, set his course unerringly toward the violation of all the laissez-faire canons. ...To scoff at Hoover's tragic failure to cure the depression as a typical example of laissez-faire is drastically to misread the historical record. The Hoover route must be set down as a failure of government planning and not of the free market.\\"<br />It would appear that the gravamen of Kissinger's Diplomacy is an unresolved conflict between church and state in the conduct of foreign affairs, personified by Wilson (church) on the one hand, and Theodore Roosevelt on the other.  He accords the freedom of Machiavellian manipulation through the Executive branch in either case.  That the Executive owns the conduct of foreign policy he would agree with Jefferson.  That Jefferson would have supported either Wilson or Kennedy is a moot question.  Jefferson, along with other Founders, Washington and Hamilton, to be specific, seemed to agree on the isolationist stance put forward in Washington's Farewell Address, which Jefferson wanted taught at his university.  As Hoover mentioned, the source of Wilson's 14 points is not at issue here.<br />I fault Dr. Kissinger on some of his purely military evaluations, and direct the reader to Douglas MacArthur's Reminiscences, if they have a place in their studies for important primary sources.  (This source was not referred to in the Kissinger text.)<br />I was surprised at Kissinger unabashed encomium for FDR, for both his domestic and foreign policy.  An interesting alternative to what could have been the conduct of WWII is suggested by John Koster in his book, Operation Snow.  Japan as an ally threatening Stalin's flank, might have left the outcome of the War less Soviet one-sided.<br />As far as the Paris Peace Conference and Wilson, I think that Dr. Kissinger might agree that had Theodore Roosevelt conducted the negotiations, the world might have escaped Hitler and the Nazi holocaust.<br />Diplomacy is a great book, and one which should be carefully studied.  But after reading it, I'm left to ponder on the words of Daniel Webster, once spoken from the floor of the Senate:<br />\\"Our security is in our watchfulness of executive power.  It was the Constitution of this department, which was infinitely the most difficult part in the great work of creating our present government; to give to the executive department such power as should make it useful, and yet not such as should render it dangerous; to make it efficient, independent and strong, and yet to prevent it from sweeping away everything by its union of military and civil authority, by the influence of patronage, and office, and force....  I do not wish to impair the power of the President as it stands written down in the Constitution.  But, I will not blindly confide, where all experience admonishes me to be jealous; I will not trust executive power, vested in the hands of a single magistrate, to keep the vigils of liberty.\\"

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway suffers s lot it keeps changing so that keeps it fun.like the fact it is on my kindle also!! Keep up he good work and ill keep playing!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|After neglecting my piano for years, I thought this would be fun for the holidays. I have actually been playing it daily for about a month and my knowledge of piano is coming back to me so much so that I just purchased a baby grand (previously I only wanted one for house decor). Cannot wait to start playing again for real, but this is fun in the office on a stressful day.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is really fun and I would suggest getting it if you love littlest pet shop like I do!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I know the books have great similarities:  England pre- and post- WWII, a &#34;big house&#34;/castle, mostly women, weak male characters.  But I loved this book!
0307352153|5.0|I am an introvert and I am also surrounded by them in my personal life. This book has been informative. I read one review where the reviewer was talking about coping strategies and fitting in. I think that what this book does is teach the introverts of the world that there is nothing wrong with them. We need all types for the world to be successful and we, as a nation, have obviously not had a \\"balanced\\" way of working, etc. This book, to me, is a call to have a more successful world by including all types.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am a fun of Josh Groban so I am bias with this review. I just love his voice and melodies. The CD is another wonderful romantic CD.
B00992CF6W|4.0|But unfortunately, using it on the kindle Fire (first edition) is a bit clunky, hence the 4 stars. Probably not the apps' fault, but caveat emptor nonetheless.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome I love it!! I suggest people buy it. It's great and so are the graphics. Great game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is extremely addicting and i can't seem to put this game down!!! a must for every kindle fire owner;)so far, no issues from this game at all.
1601251505|5.0|If you're playing Pathfinder, you need this book.<br /><br />If you're not playing Pathfinder, this and Bestiary 1 is everything you'll need to get started. Pathfinder uses the 3.5 ruleset of the artist formerly known as the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game (Pathfinder beat out the former title holder roughly two years ago and its popularity is still going up). This game cleans up many awkward rules, adds new powers and options to the Core classes, and streamlines the experience to make it easier to get into the game for the first time.<br /><br />New players, you should probably pick up the Beginner's Box before purchasing this. The Beginner's Box is a great teaching tool to get you into the game while the Core Rulebook is for people who are familiar with the 3.5 d20 system. If you're a veteran, you don't need me to tell you why this is an awesome purchase.

1601251831|5.0|If you're a GM, this book is essential to your game. You need monsters to throw at your players. Its one of the most beautiful collections of monsters ever made for an RPG by all standards and you won't be sorry you invested in this book.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Favorite tracks so far (in no particular order):<br />Closer<br />Love They Say<br />How Come You Don't Want Me<br />Drove Me Wild<br />I'm Your Hero<br /><br />I will say that it is honestly worth it to get the deluxe version of this album, or at least to buy the bonus tracks. This is a fabulous album from Tegan and Sara. It is definitely true that Heartthrob is different from their old stuff, but a unique and interesting aspect of their music is how every album is different. That's a true example of their progression as artists, musicians, and people. They are growing as the artists they are, but staying relevant in the music industry they are moving with. This is just pure goodness.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I highly recommend this book. I enjoyed every bit of it plus it was an easy read. Try it out!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have read all of Rick Riordan's books.  Mark of Athena did not disappoint me.  Mr. Riordan kept me riveted with puzzles, gods, demi-gods, action and a whole slew of new monsters.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that he left the reader hanging at the end.  Some readers do not mind that, though.  I would recommend the book to teenagers and older who are interested in Roman & Greek gods and a host of monsters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I haven't read a John Grisham book in years and was glad to get back into reading his books.  It had many twists to my way of thinking and was entertaining to read.  I read it all day & though I didn't finish it that day, it was because I kept re-reading the pages.  I expect that I am going to re-read this book several times, as the characters were well thought out.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I received this item before the shipping date which was very spectacular. This product came in brand new and packaged. It is very good quality there are no scratches and it does not skip. Amazon gave me my product wit in good time and in good quality. Amazon is a trust worthy shopping site that i will continue to use for future purchases.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|The graphics are okay, and the flight pattern seems to be tight, but the missions are lame.  AND if you backup too far your chopper disappears.  Needs more work to keep it in view at all times.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Buying this app was absolutely worth it.<br />You can see how much energy the device has still left<br />and even how long you can listen to music or<br />surf the Internet (etc.) without having to recharge.<br />And I don't regret paying for it at all.
B009LXECF6|5.0|Unorthodox Jukebox is everything I wanted it to be (except longer ;-)! It is surprisingly better than the debut.  Bruno's versatility makes it nearly impossible to categorize him! \\"Money make her Smile's deep bass is reminiscent of early hip hop. The sexy \\"Gorilla\\", \\"When I was your Man\\" \\"Money make her Smile\\" and the reggae-laced, \\"Show Me\\" are stand out tracks (if I'm forced to choose). I love this CD from beginning to end!
0765325950|1.0|Please be advised they're will be spoilers, I will try to keep them at a minimum. I am a reader, I mean a big big time reader! I have almost 400 books on my kindle and over a literal metric ton of books boxed in storage and lining wall to wall book shelves at home. I read for the story and leave all the deep thinking of the mechanics under it to formal student's of literature. I devour anywhere from 500-1300 pages a day depending on if im working or at home. This book...this book was garbage to me personally. This is my first review ever and Im writing it because honestly I'm so disappointed and shocked I have no idea what better way to let it all out. I believe I would be better off If I hadn't even read this final book. I have read Robert Jordan's series many many times over, I read from the beginning to whatever was current since book 5 when I first got into the series. This, and the sword of truth novels are my guaranteed reads every single year from my large collection. When Brian Sanderson took over I was reluctant since I was not familiar with his work, I however bought his mistborn series to get an idea of what he can do. Mistborn has to honestly be the most satisfyingly written trilogy I have ever read...period. It isn't just the theme, the characters, it isn't an epic, it is the fact that when I finished this 3 book series I felt the most satisfied, fullfilled and truly happy(not happy ending) I have ever felt. Everything that needed to be was answered just right, everything was paced perfectly, everything ended on a note that made sense. After reading this I quickly burned through the rest of his work and still do every time something new comes out, this man is a great author in my opinion and it made me excited. His first two books in the WoT series we're great, breathes of fresh air and written with all the best points that jordan had in his books. However like I stated at the beginning....this final book was a soulless horror. Lets start off with someof the reason's.<br /><br />1) Perrin's story and the way Robert Jordan wrote his story in all the books after the first couple. I'm sorry but Perrin's story is the slowest, most boring, unimportant despite it's large length in any of the books. When I reread the series now, I literally skip Perrins chapters(other than the last readthrough of them all I did when I finally received the final book). They are terrible and this final book feels like 912 pages of Jordan's style for writing perrin. This book took me 4 days to read, 4 days when I read all the ones before it in under a week. This book not only being written in that horrible style, is I would roughly estimate 825 pages of Combat and perrin(Pretty much Shinji from Evangelion at this point), with the remaining 82 pages having the only real content period and that 82 pages is a very favorable page estimate for this book not a conservative one.<br /><br />--spoiler heavy below sorry--<br /><br />2)Lost, they took a page from the Lost t.v. show except this time there is no next season. They did not answer nearly enough questions in this book. They gave us even more questions then we had before, I mean for petes sake they introduce some mystery woman in the final page of the story before the epilogue??? He's able to \\"think\\" and have stuff occur despite not using the source anymore? How the hell did he end up in morridins body, why would his women even be ok with this especially when he's not concious enough to answer? WHO SWITCHED THE BODY???? It wasn't him that's for sure! Alivia maybe? And if it was her, where did she learn how to do something like that? The keeper swapped bodies not a seanchan damane. The entire series has a huge conflict in rand concerning the 3 woman and being a good person by still loving and being loved by all three but he ponders which one will choose to follow him and be with him? None of it, none of it adds up. I admit by the end of the book I was so pissed I could have easily glanced over things that possibly answer some of these questions like apparently Graendal killed Asmodean because Shaidar Haran mentions that she killed 3 of the chosen....I'm supposed to keep a table in my head? I'm supposed to flow-chart these inuendos and death's that span 14 books out each time I pick up the novels again? When did this turn into high fantasy, the Game of houses was for the book story not for the fricking reader meant to question every word read. If I was meant to think that way while reading it I would still call foul and that the question is unanswered. He made new chosen, brought other forsaken back to life and named whoever the heck he wanted so the 3 could have been anyone of them or others unnamed.<br /><br />3)Honestly i've lost my juice just writing this out It's a rant and a review and unfortunately it breaks down to me being terribly dissapointed in Brian Sanderson's conclusion to this wonderful story. I have never been more dissapointed with the ending of a series then this one I just read.
B0058SNI94|5.0|These shoes are so comfortable and offer arch support.  They &#34;breath&#34; so your feet do not get sweaty.  I would order more in different colors if they had my size.  If you have fallen arches these will help and they don't cost a fortune.
0385504209|5.0|my son spends hours reading, this is a child who had no interest in reading, a friend recommended it to him
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a fairly quick read, if you don't have a bunch of time, this is a good book to read.<br />As it were, I read this book on our way to vegas so it was appropriate. Fun romance.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|When I saw this app, I was excited as I'm a HUGE fan of Mahjong Dimensions Deluxe and this looked like another take on that. It was close, but no cigar. The controls were a bit wonky and out doesn't quite reach the greatness of MDD.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|I'm just not the physics game kind of person, but was lured in by the cute jelly fish. Cute game... just too difficult for me
B005MMYPIE|5.0|This album is just awesome. Very unique. It's a blend of Metal and Electronic. They have 3 singers. One male singer, one dude that does all the screams, and a woman with a beautiful voice. All that blended with some heavy metal. I love it.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Our family eagerly awaits every Bones episode. The characters make the show a huge success. Yes, the stories are  interesting ; but the interaction of the characters is unique. Going into its' ninth season, it stays fresh and fun.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|This is a simple puzzle based on Mahjong but not the real game. I uninstalled it after a half hour playing.Don´t waste your time and useful memory with this \\"game\\"
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I don't like it because it tells me it's downloaded but it does not show on my apps. I didn't get to play it. It doesn't work.
B00013F35I|5.0|Every Springsteen concert is wonderful, spiritual, and memorable.  This  is one of his best. We just saw him in Phoenix this past December for a Christmas concert...Bruce is better than  ever.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a great game and has great improvements but you need to be able to adjust the sensitivity. I can barely move my guy when I move my phone. I wish you could personalize it like the first one. Other than that I would give 5 stars.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|This app is not user friendly at all, and runs very slow,or you just get kicked off the app altogether.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A very good read from start to finish. I couldn't put it down for very long. Looking forward to reading the third.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I can't figure out how to get the lastest update of this app on my Kindle Fire.  Does anyone know how?
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Good entertainment. It kept me busy for awhile, I mean why wouldnt it? trying to kill the whole world with what u created, why wouldnt you want to see it till the end. It was hard for me to put it down not guna lie. Being able to fast forward was awsome because if not it would take to long. So I payed .99 cents for it and it was worth it. Im giving it four stars because it can get alittle boring waiting for something to happen but the makers did a good job by making you do varias things like collect DNA points and stopping the cure team from producing the cure. Those things kept you on your toes as your virus becomes more deadly. In all its alittle slow at first until you get further and its still fun. I recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5 stars all the way. From the first page to the last, this book had me engulfed and I dreaded putting it down. I definitely recommend...urge you to read this book. And enjoy. :)
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Adventure? Check.  Suspense? Check.  Romance? Check.  It's all here, and the expanded story of Briana and Rodger is a brilliant one
B005R32L66|5.0|First I would like to say that it was free, you cant beat free anything these days. Its the best way to keep in touch with family. Im in the military and me and my wife use it to talk to our family back home, it keeps us all togather. Its way better than talking on the phone, why would you when you can see the face of ur spouse when they are deployed or your parents that you havent seen for some time because you moved or close friends you want to share your new experiences with. Those are things to consider when looking for an app to basically use to reconnect with certain people. I love it, and I wouldnt choose anything else. Besides you can even make calls and do other things with it, they do cost minutes if u want to make calls but the video calling is totally free and the app is free. Cant beat it. 5 stars all the way. Recommended indefinately.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|It was Okay.  The kids would like it, but the adults would think that it was just Okay.  Could of been better.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I think it's one of the best!!!  Wonderful animation and all of the animals are just so creative.  Would recommend to anyone.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It was a great movie.  It was very funny and great for the kids to watch over and over again.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|As and avid Downton Abbey watcher the beginning of the book was interesting as it showed what an honor it was to go 'into service' at a big house. The servants were no longer hungry or cold, they were well fed and glad to have their jobs. As with the tv show, life changes with the wars and the family and servants change as well.<br />This book is an easy, pleasant read.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|I think LPs 45s & 78s are great too, Joe, but I had to settle for a CD.  At least it's not MP3.<br /><br />I like this album.  It's modernesque, but it still sounds like Joe Walsh.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's a great read kept me wanting to not put the book down. Love the steamy hot moments. Love that it was not over done when it came to the bedroom talk. Th start of the book kinda the me off because it just boom!.... it all happened so fast I actually had to go back and 're read the first couple chapters because I felt like I skipped something important. But once the marriage happened it was a great book till the end. I wouldn't mind see a little movie play out to the story line just to I could see it come to life a see what got guy they choose to play Connor :-)
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Kid-o practially melted the DVD player with this movie by the end of week 1.  Pretty funny parts for adults to enjoy too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an awesome story. It could be our future!  If u want to destroy my sweater pull the string and walk away.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Good writing, great characters.  The story keeps you into the season, and wanting more when it ends.  Of course, many liberties are taken in the name of action, drama, and excitement, but I mean you're not going to get good ratings if there was a whole episode dedicated to bike maintenance & everyday drudgery.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|overall the sounds are nice and relaxing. you can tell some are loops but that does not take away from the app unless one has an extremly sensitive ear. My favorite is campfire. I set it to play for 20 min. as I drift ro sleep. I like the timer and alarm set features. I got it as the free app of the day. I also like that one can download more sounds.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I really like this movie in addition to kid-o really, really liking it.  I like the story, and the characters are well written.
B005S9ELVC|4.0|\\"I want to talk to you about the war for the soul of Los Angeles.\\" In 1949 LA one man runs the city, mobster Mickey Cohen (Penn). Unable to find someone to testify against him the chief of police puts together a special unit to take him down. Lead by Sgt. John O'Mara (Brolin) he hand picks his squad and the war for LA begins. I am a huge fan of mobster/gangster type movies and was really looking forward to seeing this. I was not disappointed. I knew nothing of the real story so the entire thing was new to me and that made it an entertaining experience. The cast is perfect in this and the action and story really move along very fast and the movie feels shorter then it was. There are some very graphic scenes in this (man gets ripped in half) so if that bothers you then I would maybe avoid this. If you are into fast moving, violent, mob/police driven movies with a great cast then this is one not to miss. Overall, an extremely entertaining gangster movie that grabs you from opening scene, I highly recommend this. I give it an A.
1439102732|1.0|i love  jodi picoult and she is my fav author but this book fell short. call me a homophobe and say what you want but i couldnt finish it. the woman goes lesbian and its just too detailed account of what they do in bed. If your gay thats fine i wont treat you badly or make fun of you- you can have whatever kind of opinion you want but i dont like reading detailed accounts of chick on chick sex. it just made me uncomfortable.
B00ANGICRE|4.0|\\"There was no escaping it a door had opened that I could not close, and in invisible writing it said do not enter.\\" Mark O'Brien (Hawkes) is a writer living in an iron lung. After an idea for the sexual habits of the disabled approaches him his life is changed. He now wants to experience it for himself, before time runs out. Judging by the description I think I know what your thinking, but this is not over the top sexual. While it is the main idea of the movie the acting job by Hawkes is the driving force. The way he portrays a man full of fear and uncertainty about what is going really gives depth and heart to a character who otherwise would come off as creepy. There is some humor in this and it really helps move the film along. This is not a movie for everyone but it is an interesting experience and I liked it. There is a lot of nudity and sex in this movie but it is more technical and doesn't border on soft-core so if that is what is holding you back don't worry. This is a movie worth seeing for the acting and the way you really start to feel for Mark, Cheryl (Hunt) and their experience. It's hard to explain how this makes you feel, it's something you need to see for yourself. Overall, different and better then I was expecting. Not for everyone but I think its worth watching. I give it a B+.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I bought this book because of all the great reviews it had, though many, many other books get 4/5 star ratings that don't deserve it. This book definitely does. The characters and their \\"issues\\" were very well developed. The author gives them so much depth, plus nothing gushy and repetitive like so many other books similar to this one. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and will likely purchase more titles from this author.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|\\"This is what defeat looks like bro. Your jihad is over.\\" On September 11, 2001 the United States was attacked by a group of terrorists taking orders from Osama Bin Laden. Following that attack the intelligence agency of the US began a man hunt for him to bring him to justice. Ten years later with the help of Seal Team 6 he was taken down. This is the story of the man hunt. I love movies that are based on real events but they are sometimes hit or miss. The hardest part for a movie like this where the events have just happened is to keep it interesting and keep you watching even though you know the end. This movie succeeded beyond all hope. Much like Apollo 13 when the climax happens you are on the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens even though you know the outcome. That is what makes this movie great. Also Bigelow has almost a Spielberg like quality to take hardcore war movies like this and Hurt Locker and transform them into movies that rely on great actors and not just the action. As great and exciting as this movie was Jessica Chastain was incredible in this and she is one of the reasons you get so involved with the story. This is another movie I could go on and on about but this is a definite must see and one of the best movies of the year. Overall, tense and gripping. Which is great for a movie where everyone knows how it ends. I give it an A.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I really liked this book, it was very complicated but once I got towards the middle I got the meaning really well. I'm looking forward to the next one.!!!!  :-)
B007REV4YI|5.0|\\"He knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond, a place you say doesn't exist, the shadows.\\" The world's greatest secret agent is back, but is the need for an agent outdated in today's modern world? After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a supper fun game. I love how u can conect to face book and it will show your friends scores. This is also a very adicting game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun to play and very addictive.  I love this game. Wish they had more like it. My kids like it also.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|After such a great season with so many twists ending it with an hour long interview was aweful.  I was so dissaponted.  I expected more out of the season finale.

B008476HBM|5.0|The story took you back to old England, loves lost and loves restored. I would recommend this to men and women.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Recommend this app it is fun and I play it all the time anyone who is thinking about buying this app should stop thinking
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Completely captivating. Couldn't stop playing. quite addictive!  I can play this every day no problem. Great graphics too. Lots of clues if needed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the many versions that are available to read and also the ability of sound.  It is one of the best that is there.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Thus is a great game it reminds me of WOW a little bit.  I haven't played multi player yet because it won't recognize ny password.  Other than that a lot if fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire book. The main character is amazing, (I think I may be in love with her) she is strong, clever, brave, loving... & she is a survivor. This book leads you on an exciting journey, but what happens while you flip through the pages is uncanny... this story leaves an imprint on you. Compassion, love, respect, understanding, patience, & humility... in a story that is supposed to be about a battle royale to the death!?! A socio-economical, socio-political, thought-provoking, story of human decency & indecency... interwoven in a young adult 's fantasy action adventure book. Amazing!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This had to be the worst movie I have seen in years.  Slow paced, dull acting and simple plot.  Only watched the whole movie because I couldn't believe it was that terrible.  Kept waiting for it to get better, but never did.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed is my new favorite writer! She made me rethink my values and reflect on what really matters to me in this short life.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very interesting book,give me a new look at the world of zombies.It showed how the world was impected as a whole.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This goes into the top 10 books I have read in my lifetime. I couldn't put it down.  What else can I say? Ernest Cline is brilliant.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my mother in-laws and I was a bit sceptical at first but it didn't take me long to be submerged into the world of tally Youngblood.<br />What teen agger hasn't just wanted to fit in and her futuristic world isn't to unbelievable I can't wait to read on in the series.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Ok, you can drop the price now. Itunes already has.  Good Band. wish they would tour here. Better than Opeth.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it is entertaining and fun to play for hours. The game has many limited time specials. The regular setting is in New york.
B0015F1VY8|1.0|I was looking forward to this film after falling in love with the first one:  Elizabeth:  The Virgin Queen.  But this pales in comparison,its  a flat story, cliche ridden depending upon poor story telling devices with none of the interesting plot lines or deliciously cunning characters, such as Francis Walsingham (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush) as constructed in the first film.  Save your time, see the first film twice rather than this one at all.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app because I don't have to wait and catch and watch it on the tv on the eights.
0740797719|5.0|I have purchased dozens of books on drawing and painting techniques, but I think this might be my favorite. His writing is clear and concise and contains a lot of good information which is illustrated by his paintings.
0006513778|5.0|The book arived in excellent condition and had all of my favorite stories.  I reread Agatha Christie from time to time and it is nice to have them all in one place.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This product was delivered quickly and in good condition. I watched the whole thing almost immediately and can't wait for Season 4. Maggie Smith is delightful as always.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As so many others have pointed out, we are witnessing the birth of major new talent in Sci-fi. With Wool, Howey draws you into a world that presents moral and ethical quagmires paired with raw emotional and physical torment. The outrage we feel over the treatment of the principal characters is matched only by our curiosity to learn more about the world they inhabit. A thoroughly engrossing read and a wonderful escape.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|available on any and every platform just about and smoothly sync between them.  my go to note taking app.  useful for all types of projects.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a good book that keeps you interested wondering just how it will end. However, even though it was a good read, the ending was not quite believable and a bit convoluted. It seemed like the writer was not quite sure how to bring the book to a believable end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this Solitaire game. I am hooked. So nice to play on my Kindle, no reshuffling of the cards. Graphics are great.
0375507256|5.0|I loved the way he wrote (1 story 2 story 3 story 4 story 5 story 6 story and so on 6 5 4 3 2 1).  It felt like I was reading the best set of short stories I have ever read (take that Joyce, Doyle, and Chekhov).
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|After my first viewing of Cosmopolis, I considered it a very strange movie. It stuck in my mind, though, and I wanted to give it another chance. I am pleasantly surprised by Robert Pattinson's growing acting ability demonstrated with this difficult role. I have also started to read the book and watch the DVD one scene at a time. This process makes me realize the almost paralyzing beauty of this story of a young man in crisis.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|Now the short stories were not bad, but I really enjoyed this book.  It displayed Holmes in all of his analytic glory.  Highly recommended to those who have never read any of Doyle's work, or are looking for a step up from the short stories.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had been told about this show for awhile but never tuned in.<br /><br />I wish I had ... then rather than watch 3 seasons in almost as many days, I could have done it intelligently - watching one episode per week over a three year period.<br /><br />Get season one ... I envy you --- you've almost 2 full seasons to go!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I don't understand why anyone would give this book less than five stars.  Obviously I have read the four preceding novels and loved all of them as well.  Kudos to George for writing another awesome episode in the epic that is A Song of Ice and Fire.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I received acknowlement of my order right away.I was just coming home from surgery and my daughter asked if I had ordered any reading material I responed no.She placed the order for me and received the books on my Kindle with in minutes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good for my daughter to play with, but she did get bored after a little while. I guess that is how all games are though. It was a great value for the use and I would recommend it to everyone else!
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|This tugs at most of the cliches of Santa Claus and Christmas, and that is great.  I saw it in 3D at a theater and enjoyed it enough to get it 3D for home.  Glad I did.  Bless reindeer, elves and all others who try to keep that side of Christmas alive and well.
B008D1RD1W|4.0|This is a welcome return of one of the most idiosyncratic singer songwriters of the late 60's and early 70's. The album itself is majestic, elegiac, and everything one would expect from Bill Fay. That being said, vinyl fans need to know that the LP suffers from serious pressing issues. I have gone through 4 different copies, all of which were severely compromised. The last copy was sent to me by the record label as a replacement for the earlier poor pressings. It was a very stand up thing for them to do, sending me a free copy of an album from their cataogue. Unfortunately, the newly cut, freshly pressed copy is still problematical. While easily a 100% improvement over the initial pressings, it is still extremely noisy and prone to distortion. While I am a champion of vinyl, buyers might be better off with a download or CD copy. I hate to say it, as I prefer vinyl over any other format. But the pressing issues are a real problem here. Beware.<br />The material itself is remarkable. Absolutely gorgeous. And a reminder that rock n roll is not necessarily a young man's game. Definitely buy the album, but choose your format advisedly.
B00633W614|5.0|Totally enjoyed reading this series.  I still have one more book to read, but this was a great read.  Just read them in sequence so you know what has happened.  Really enjoyed this book.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|First, I want to thank you Jonas, what a great story... i think it would be a great movie starring the great clint eastwood...i laughed a lot could not stop telling everyone i know about it..and most of all i am not so afraid of growing older...thanks again!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazingly addictive and fun. Definitely worth buying, and it's free! In comparison to the first temple run, temple run 2 is much better. There are three stages: the temple, the forest, and a mine, where you ride in a mine cart, lean side to side, and duck under opsticles.<br />I got this app a few days ago and am thoroughly enjoying it. Definitely 5+ stars for this Imangi app!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Im not one to do puzzels. However I was bored and figured I would give it a try. not bad but not something that I would do often
B0044RFT8S|5.0|A really entertaining and funny family fun. I really enjoy this series even though I am a senior citizen.  A great family film; first in what is so far a trilogy of film presentations.  If you buy this you'll want the two that follow it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Always get a lot of thoughout the day, I get them on my laptop, blackberry and now with my kindle. I like how easy it is to use!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|so I would like to start by saying that the worlds for this game are better than the first. What isn't better than the first version though are the graphics, controls and bonuses. This game took almost fifteen minutes to laid on my kindle fire and now it's very glitchy and freezes every few moments or so.<br /><br />I hope someone else has better luck with this game but I am deleting it, it was an utter waist of time and I am glad I didn't spend any money on it. GET AT YOUR OWN RISK.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this because I love to waste time pinning things to random boards that I have. I was very happy when it came on the Kindle!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If your a horse lover then this is the game for you. You can enter competitions or just take care of your horse. you can even customize the look of your horse and/or buy more. I highly recommend this game.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I read this book about a year ago, and I still remeber everything about it. Which is saying something because I read over 100 books a year! great read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great quality videos... Best season so far. I love this show.  New characters and exciting plot this season, if you like the first two seasons this season will blow you away.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I was skeptical buying this book for $9.99, because I usually get the free books first to see if I like the author and if I do then I will buy a book that isn't free. However Gillian Flynn doesn't have any books that are free so I took the chance! I was pleasantly surprised!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved reading and learning all about Pat Peoples and the many relationships he has. I was rooting for him and Tiffany the whole time.
B0002TKFGI|5.0|This 2004 SACD remastering is way better than the [[ASIN:B000003FEG CD issued in 1993]]; the sound is cleaner and brighter, there is almost no distortion; tape hiss is present but it's not a problem (in my opinion it's better to have some hiss than to listen to an extremely denoised remastering). Great edition.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Twist that i wouldnt have imagined! Had a hard time putting the book down. I enjoyed it very much, kept my attention
B0076DELIG|3.0|The Black Box was a nice fast read, but didn't blow me away.  It took a while for things to heat up, and when it finally did there weren't a whole lot of twists or turns.  Just an average read in my opinion.
B004SUDPXW|4.0|Great acting by all. Bryan Cranston continues his path of the title. As you watch each episode expect the unexpected!
B004WR125O|5.0|Plugged this into my Onkyo receiver and it worked flawlessly. Instructions say to use front USB port, but if your receiver has a back one, it will work there too. Streams internet radio and network music with absolutely no issues.  Definitely recommend picking this up if you get a new Onkyo receiver.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun way to pass the time.  It starts out fairly easy, and then the puzzles get more and more complex.  Be prepared to think.  Great game if you like puzzles.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I liked the movie, but the quality was bad. The movie kept pausing, freezing and was blurry at times. I've never had this problem when watching a movie on prime instant video.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I lived this book of I could I would read it a million times read this book you will be happy you did
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Love the set. Quality is good.Price was high. Box is attractive. Looking forward to the next season (at a lower price.)
B00A4W3AJC|5.0|Some movies are made for a very specific audience. The kind of audience that yearns for a creation that has never been tried before and when transformed into an audio-visual format, leaves you speechless and spellbound once you have had the luck and the pleasure to view it. That's Holy Motors for you. There are quite a few actors in the movie. And kudos to the director for extracting every bit of acting abilities from each one of them. Be it the lead protagonist or the assistant of the photographer who gets shocked when trying to interrupt him from admiring beauty or even the kid playing his teenaged daughter. No matter how big or small the size of your role or your screen time, everyone did an amazing job - thanks to the director.<br /><br />It is not very often that you get the opportunity to watch a movie that has almost no relationship to anything you might have seen before on the big screen or has any association with life as it exists (for the most part) and yet is not about special effects or scifi or historical events or futuristic fantasies. That's Holy Motors for you. Every scene is a fantasy of it's own special kind and leaves you thinking - thinking about the purpose and need of the event that you just saw. More often than not, you won't be able to derive any logical reason out of what you saw? But isn't it what we deal with on a day to day basis in our day to day lives - trying to find reasons and logic behind anything and everything that we have to go through (be it the good, the bad or the ugly); go through extreme emotions of happiness and excitement and sadness and dilemma that our lives subject us to? What if we go through emotions that we cannot define? That's what Holy Motors did for me and for all the reviews I have read about the movie - ever since I saw it on big screen - that is what I understood from all the other viewers who saw this movie. Anyone who had the time and patience to give a true description of what they thought about this moviehad one common thing to say - the movie left them thinking. But no one could truly define what is it that the movie left them thinking about. It is extremely hard to put down in words because that's how intriguing and deep and intricate this movie is. To be honest - I really don't want to know the answer and the gist about what this movie is trying to convey or what the director had in his mind when he was making this piece. It is personal to him. And in a similar way - he has given a personal gift to everyone who was touched after watching this movie and yet cannot define or put in words what exactly touched them. That is what movies should be all about - and unfortunately for the most of them, they are not. But i am glad I saw Holy Motors and it succeeded in giving me what I was looking for - nothing at all, yet everything that I don't find in movies that I am subjected to in the world that we live in.<br /><br />Parting thoughts - How come Kylie Minogue never ceases to look beautiful and has a voice to match? Lucky, Lucky, Lucky!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|The book was informative; I'm glad I got the ereader edition rather than the individual books. Price was excellent, thank you for asking.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Very pleased with this movie.  I already owned it in VHS so wanted DVD to replace it.  A truly great Jim Carrey movie with Jim at his best....super funny!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|i really liked the first season but this one just didnt do it for me.  first of all i think they tried to do too many things in one season.  there was the serial killer, the aliens, the nazi doctor still doing experiments, the fear of lesbians, demonic possesion and many other freaks.  every time the doctor would feed the things in the woods i kept expecting big foot and the yeti to pop out and maybe the loch ness would show up in one of the therapy tubs!  lots of great actors and individual episodes would work but overall it was just ok.  to end the season the episodes just started abruptly ending things, like the demonic nun that just dies and the devil doesnt pass to anyone else, and the last episode was just trying to tie everything up.  the first season you knew there was no easy answer to everything and you were left thinking that there was still more to come with that house and i liked that, no pretty happy ending, it was messy like life.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As always this author puts out a wonderful story line, another book where you can't put it down,  Harry Bosch is a great detective<br />working against the criminals, what a great character.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game but some of the missions are way too easy. Fun to keep playing and playing. It seems like it will take awhile to collect items to unlock specials.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I didn't think I would like this, but I'm really enjoying it. The graphics are nife and there are so many different activities to do. Who would have thought taking care of a virtual horse would be so fun?
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game must have a glitch in it. I have seen others with this same problem. I am only able to play two or three times before I can't access it anymore.
1439181780|5.0|My words are not enough to reach out about this book. I feel that I just get an energy when I look at it
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's good a good read for younger kids from 8-pretty much adult I have read all of Jeff Kinney s books one they are great I hop he continues to write them
1451673442|5.0|I can write a book about this for years as it changed my life in magical touch without any doubt that I can be better more than accepting myself and be thankful for all what I am
B000MAH5O2|5.0|I ENJOYED HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA EXPLAINED HIS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY BY USING EXAMPLES IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO EXPLAIN, CLEARLY AND SIMPLY HIS ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS.  HE BACKED HIS STATEMENTS UP WITH EXAMPLES.  I NOW, BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE HE IS COMING FROM AND IT CRYSTALLIZED MY THINKING.
B009NOVCSS|3.0|I feel it was overpriced for the small amount of songs that I actually recognized and liked.I should have purchased a simple &#34;best of&#34; cd for $15.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|A MEMOIR THAT ADDS SO MUCH INSIGHT INTO THE WAY PRESIDENT OBAMA VIEWS HIMSELF, POLITICS AND THE WORLD.  IT HAS BROADENED MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HIS BACKGROUND HAS INFORMED HIS PRESIDENCY.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite TV series. I find it fascinating the way the dynamic of the upstairs and downstairs people’s lives intertwine. The series keeps getting better and better.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|an amazing live performance with some amazing live musicians . I can't say enuff about the arrangements of the old standards.  Brought them back to life for me.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Best Musical Ever! I am so glad I purchased this movie! I've been waiting to buy it for a while and it came within a few days!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A game changer for how I work and organise myself, whether I'm mobile or at my desk. I love that whether I'm taking notes via text or audio I don't need to leave the application and have everything central. When I heard about Evernote&rsquo;s ability to catalog business cards...now all that data can actually be found and useful for once!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I've been playing this app for hrs &amp; it hasn't once asked me for a review..which is ironic because the crappy ones bug you to death, &amp; this one is AWESOME &amp; never does- otherwise I suspect you would see a LOT more 5-star reviews! Anyway, it's so good I went out of my way to come back &amp; say so. Had my Kindle Fire for 2 yrs now &amp; this is, dare I say, the BEST app I've ever had! I would gladly pay SO much more than 99&cent; for this app, &amp; as good as it is I would grab it at this price while you can..HUGE PROPS to the developers of this app; you people are pure geniuses! And this is now officially the longest review I've written in my life by far...and this game deserves it! Just buy it &amp; PLZ come back to thank the developers after! Liquid Entertainment, you have my attention! :-)
0061339202|5.0|I needed this book for class. Personally I would not read this on my own time, but it wasn't terrible.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I will definitely be buying more of John Mayers stuff. The songs from this album that got all the radio airplay are not even my favorite songs on the album.
B002NWOOXW|4.0|I liked it very much, I have watched it on cable several times.<br />I watch this movie when I was still able to purchase and watch movies, wjhich it seems I am not longer able to do.<br /><br />Anita Grayson
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is amazing. The character depth is just absolutly outstanding, every page leaves you yearning for the next. This series is in my all time top five list, george has me hooked for life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great app for kindle fire and I play it very often and I enjoy the quality of the grafics.
1907563202|5.0|This is my first crochet book, and honestly I didn't have any idea how to read patterns.<br />The \\"Crochet Know-How\\" section is absolutely perfect! It had everything I needed to know, and now I can finally understand the instructions. I would recommend this to someone who has never crocheted before because of the beautiful instructions (with pictures- thank goodness!) on how to make each stitch.<br />The pictures and gorgeous and vibrant, and I find myself wanting to make everything. Really cute ideas, like jam jar covers & tea cozies to the more classic like blankets & purses.<br /><br />Overall- great book. Lovely pictures & directions.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this!~
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|This game is a great brain stimulator! Whether you play with one player or four, lots of fun! Good for spacial relationship training.
0142001104|1.0|A complete rip-off from the Landmark Forum.  Landmark has been teaching this for 22 years, and these people say that they developed it?  Even the terms that they use come from Landmark - I guess their possibility was making money off of someone else's material.  It worked!
0763631205|5.0|This is my families favorite Christmas tale.  After seeing countless versions and interpretations of the book in movies, plays and musicals I decided to buy the original.  Dickens  has a reputation of being a hard to read, but I did not feel this book fell in to that category.  Overall, the interpretations are close to the book with minimal changes and/or variations.  I did enjoy reading it.
B008602KQI|5.0|It kept my interest and there were a number of scenes that gave food for thought. War? Peace? Envy? Love?
B005USZYDU|5.0|It awesome I really liked it I am goin to continue to read the series thank you great day great
B006BDHAX0|4.0|It was fun for a few hours and then my Kindle Fire crashed.  Hope it can be fixed.  Interesting artwork
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Awesome sequel to Temple Run, but needs a lot of the bugs worked out! Otherwise I won't stop running on!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The series is fantastic. I purchased this from Amazon as a gift and was informed by the recipient on the last day to return the item that the third DVD of six had hidden damage and was cracked. I paid the postage to return it, hoping for a replacement and was refunded half the amount of the original cost that I had paid. I was willing to suffer the loss and reorder it since it was a gift and I had missed the deadline to return by one day, but the price had doubled. Luckily, I was able to purchase it from PBS.org, plus season three, for the same amount Amazon was charging for parts 1 and 2. I've been ordering from Amazon for years and this was my first real disappointment. They have generally been very good, but Buyer, beware!
B0015RFCZ0|3.0|I purchased this for a friend who liked the movie.<br />I thought it was a little too predictable, however, I did like the music and<br />the creativity aspects of the story.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This adaptation is especially well done. Every aspect of production from the scenic panoramic shots to the musical choices are brilliant. I am also a fan of the series with Colin Firth as as Darcy, but all aspects of this representation are first class. My favorite!
B004DM0UII|5.0|You want choices... here ya' go, literally a gazillion stations to choose from. Absolutely a must have for your apps list.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|An oldie but goodie. Watched it on Family Night. Son and grandson liked it [obviously...LOL]. If Tom Cruise fan see it. Must of been one of his first movies.
0765325950|4.0|I have been reading the Wheel of Time series since 1990,  I was 22 years old I am now 43. I am so glad that the series is finally over so I can have closure on all these wonderful characters. I am also glad that team Jordan concidered the fans when they decided to finish the series. I was very upset when Mr Jordan passed thinking the series would not be finished but i think he would be very pleased with what Brandon Sanderson wrought from his notes.<br /><br />I for one was very satisfied with the ending knowing where they all came from and to see the developement of the characters at the end was very gratifying. I think some of it was hurried but with so much information that had to be written for this last book I can understand why some things seemed rushed. Mostly I think everyone that followed the series from the beginning is both glad and saddened about losing these characters that if not family then close friends. The story starts off slow but when it gets moving, holy! Action packed! I enjoyed A Memory of Light and I would suggest it to friends.<br /><br />Vince
030746363X|3.0|Overall book is decent. But a lot of the material is &#34;over-one's-head&#34; and technical. A lot of pages so just holding book to read your must lose weight...LOL...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A lot of ppl said it wasn't written well; however, I I thought it was a quick read. But ppl need to realized that it's fiction.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|This review is NOT about the movie but Amazon service. I have tried everything to get this movie to work. But so far nothing I feel I was cheated out of my money. Even the button to see it in reg, def does not work. This has happened before. Will call the service at Amazon to demand my money back. I will have to go thru Windows 8 on my Asus Tablet to get the movie. Not happy at all!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome so down load it!!!!!I mean it do it I say do it now come on take my advice
B005DR64OQ|5.0|I thought Nicholas Cage had one of his best performances with supporting actress Nicole Kidman this was a thrill ride from the beginning to the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great gamming experience it's a great game to play that's why I give it 5 out of 5. Get the game also it is a world tour so you go to different places which I find great as it gives the gamer a gr8 experience
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i have not played this game yet so i can not tell you how I like it! Thank you very much
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|The ending was aww<br />I thought it was so so so so so so so so so so so sweet
B005LAIHCM|4.0|The movie was very good but I like more horror, I would reccommend this to my friends and family! Thanks
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is incredible credible. And suspenseful. After a few chapter I couldn't put it down. Sparks has outdone himself again. Every book he  written is off the charts amazing..
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great movie!! If you like the original Ice Age, you will definately like this one! I highly recommend it to the Ice Age fan!!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  Regret that it was discontinued but remains alive here.  It leaves you wondering does Eli get the machine to work and what happens in 3 years......
B004RL9T50|5.0|Great movie!! It has a lot of comedy and a good storyline. I highly recommend this movie to comedy / animation fans!!
0738735027|5.0|I collect  &#34;feline&#34; Tarot cards.  I already have the large deck and decided to get the mini for ease of taking it with me.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have been waiting for a number of issues to be resolved and questions to be answered and this book did it all.
B0013D6LEM|2.0|This album was an incredible buy and I was anticipating listening to it on my iPod; however, after spending an entire afternoon trying to transfer it to my iPod, had to give up. A waste, even at a bargain price!
B008MM9630|5.0|Best thing about this game is that you don't have to beg strangers or annoy friends to finish tasks. The game play is easy and a good time consumer. You can purchase \\"gems\\" for better items and they don't cost a lot. You also earn the gems quite easily during regular game play which is quite refreshing compared to other games. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys this kind.
B00683JK9K|5.0|The problems people are reporting about lost pieces are probably due to pieces getting under the puzzle, which happened to me a few times.  This is easy to fix: just move the whole puzzle occasionally to see if there are any pieces underneath.<br /><br />The only other issue I saw was that it can be a little picky about finger movements when scrolling through the puzzle pieces.  But once you realize that your finger has to be moving *before* it touches the screen (i.e. a normal 'flick' instead of a drag-n-drop), you get used to it pretty quick.  Maybe the authors can support drag style too, which would improve intuitiveness.<br /><br />Anyway, finally found an app that my wife likes!  And even better, we can play it together.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|As a child i really enjoyed this movie and love watching it with my nieces. They are now 3 and they love it.
075669812X|5.0|This is a must have for a Ninjago fan. The price here is the best and its a very thorough guide that will let your little fan day dream about all the potential play time they can create from it.
0670023329|5.0|I had ordered the book just after reading the few sample pages Amazon provided this page with.<br />Immediately I became attached to Shin, the young man who escaped from Camp 14, and wanted to know more. The story reminded me of Night by Ellie Wiesel in some ways. Shin's want for survival makes the reader want to keep turning the page. When did he get out? Where did he go? How did he do it? It's almost impossible to put the book down and I find myself going back to the book to re-read some of the stories that were told.<br /><br />It is also a great book to read if you're looking for a little bit of reevaluation. I find myself saying \\"I'm hungry\\" a lot less and calling my parents a bit more than I usually did.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in current History. It's very moving and tragic and in a way I wish I could shake the hand of this man, the author and Shin that is.<br />If you are a history teacher of any sort, this is a MUST read.<br />100% recommend and I'm very glad I bought this book.<br /><br />-Gray
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|If the ambitious Dream Attic was a bit over the top and unwieldy for some, Thompson's latest is more back to basics. Title says it all, and it's been a while since Thompson's done an album with so many upbeat rockers. Well, \\"up-bleak\\" might be more apropos if you take the lyrics into consideration.<br /><br />Thompson's guitar playing is in stellar form and his fingers never wander, stray or distract from the songs. And what a healthy batch they are.<br /><br />Kicking off with the violent and lustful Stony Ground, Salford Sunday is a surprising follow up. The catchiest bed sit moper I've heard in ages; as toe tapping as it's tortured. Another major standout is Good Things Happen to Bad people which raises the roof while giving Iago a run for his jealousy. Another highlight is the absolutely gut-wrenching Another Small Thing In Her Favor. Further proof Thompson is up there with Dylan, Waits, and Van Morrison in the songwriting department.<br /><br />I'm willing to bet not every track will knock it out of the ball park for even the most devout. I'd be surprised to hear any calls for Treadmill or Where's Home during a live show. But brooding, slow burners like My Enemy and the eerily yearning Snow Goose are guaranteed to keep you coming back for more. Powerful stuff. Speaking of which, Saving The Good Stuff For You ends Electric on a darkly wry but bleakly heartbreaking note. In other words, vintage Thompson.<br /><br />As for the bonus disc, while well aware of the marketing ploy here, go for the \\"deluxe\\" version here. As you might expect, it's a mix of filler and killer (pun intended). I Found A Stray, Tic-Tac Man and Auldie Riggs are indispensable and would have taken the original album from memorably good to great.<br /><br />While I admit to being a seasoned devotee who has found something of value in nearly every Thompson album, no matter how imperfect, I'm by no means a blind, genuflecting fan. After repeated listens, I have the sneaking suspicion longtime subscribers will come back to this one, ranking it up there with Rumor & Sigh.cribers will come back to this one, ranking it up there with Rumor & Sigh.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game Is amazing and it really addictive to play I really want another game to come out just allow this one so  I can play on it all the while thank you for whoever made this game I love it xxx
B00555X8OA|5.0|LOVED the book. I think this gives a good idea on what to look for in it.<br /><br />People like to think of themselves as being rational agents, as a set of individuals who are in control over their beliefs and decisions. Standard economic models operated under these beliefs, assuming that people were sensible utility-maximizers, departing from reason simply because some passion or emotion distorts their judgment. However, research conducted over the years by Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tverski, and dozens of other scientists have shown otherwise. They have shown that, under conditions commonly found in today's working environments, intuitive thinking and decision making does not follow the economic model after all, for the machinery of cognition gives way to systematic biases and irregularities that do not “maximize utility.” We as human beings are prone to apply casual intuition and thinking inappropriately, demonstrating a predisposed inclination towards plausibility, representativeness, and other biases, while disregarding the “mere statistics” essential to a decision. Thus, by weaving together decades of research, Daniel Khaneman's Thinking Fast and Slow masterfully guides the reader through these irregularities, their psychological explanations, and some advice on how to approach life more rationally.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've known the general story for many years but I didn't realize how much other information was contained in the book.  I enjoyed refreshintg my memory about the story.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Watch looks like a much more expensive time piece.<br />Only gripe I have is the gear train used to adjust the hands is sloppy<br />Takes nearly a 1/4 turn before the hand start to move. I' m told this is a sign of a cheap movement. I really don't know if that is true...<br />Never the less the watch keeps perfect time judged against one of them Fort Collins radio wall clocks.<br />Lots of positive comments.

B00683JK9K|1.0|I just downloaded this today since it was free and looked like it would be fun. I couldn't get the pieces to rotate at all. So frustrating. I just removed it from my Kindle Fire HD.

B001LM1456|3.0|I wouldn't want to watch it again, but now I understand the references made in The Avengers..still was entertaining to watch.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|I had seen this movie several times, but decided it had been awhile<br />since I last viewed it, so I'd give it a view. As before I kind of liked it,<br />but found that it dragged in places and took too long to get where<br />it was going.<br />If you're a diehard comic book fan, then by all means give Watchmen<br />a view. I'll probably watch it again in a few months or so, but I get<br />really upset that Amazon doesn't provide closed captioning on their<br />streaming service!! Everyone else does!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Why didn't this movie make more money?  Great actors, sets and effects made this a fast paced 90 minute treat.  More please.........

B008Y6UOQW|5.0|What do you say after all these years? It is the most truthful movie about NYC. Travis Bickle did what most of us only think about in our darkest dreams.  This life is not fantasy and there are no easy answers, but to go around thinking that you will find the answers in yourself is silly to say the least.<br />You must learn what is right and correct actions need to be taken by you and no one else.<br />Travis saw the truth and had the courage to do something about it..
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I head my bride talking about it and decided to give it a try.  Should have asked someone who read it.  I read for pleasure and this did not provide pleasure for me.
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|My wife and I both loved this movie. It's not an &#34;over the top&#34; comedy nor is it a boring documentary about how birders do a &#34;big year.&#34; It's just the right mixture of both. To be honest, we didn't expect it to be as enjoyable as it was. Anyone who follows real &#34;big years&#34; will appreciate the locations and truth behind the making of this film. Well done to everyone associated with its creation.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|This story is so slow that I can barely endure 3 to 5 pages an evening.  I am oh so weary of Jack Reacher mental meanderings and lack of action that I would not be disappointed with his death.  If you are in to overly verbose descriptive phrases, extended suppositions that may or maybe determined or simply enjoy a &#34;slow boat to China&#34;, jump in.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An excellent book.  American has been blest by his service to our country to keep us free.  I don't believe that we get what sacrifices these men and women and their families have done for us.  Maybe we all need live a day under the rule of savages and we would appreciate our freedom and understand what God has given us.
B008K93302|5.0|Got this to replace the one that was initially installed on my tablet.  So often trials that come with products aren't better than the free ones, as in this case..
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is a genius, and it comes through ever more powerfully in this book.  In order to break through statistical &#34;noise,&#34; and to be better able to determine significant &#34;signals,&#34; regarding predictions and polling, read this book!
B0000071GA|5.0|only song i listen to but who cares ! i found the cd and get to here my favorite song ever !!
1616550414|5.0|This book is very cool.. It reveals a lot of previously unknown information and very extensive concept art..  There's even a Skyward Sword  manga in the back! If your a fan oh LOZ you have to get this book.. It's worth a whole of a hell lot more than there selling it for..
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|In general I finished the movie wondering if it really was the end, some good action at times, but overall a slow moving movie.  I had expected better based on the premise.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great album!  All of the songs are good.  Would recommend to anyone for some mellow listening.  Looking forward to what else they come out with!
159562015X|5.0|This book was required for a business course I took a few years ago--and I still have it!  It was a quick read, and had some unique online components which allow you to further delve into your personal strengths.  It is a unique take on life--approaching it from the perspective of maximizing on what you have instead of compensating for what you do not.  Good read!
B002JWD6AS|3.0|I was looking for a new book to read and came across this one and loved it. Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Loved that this is one of those movies you'll have to see more than once!  So many levels, and dimensions!  I really liked this one!
0375851569|5.0|Dr. Seuss's Books are always enjoyable for children to read.  I bought this collection for my granddaughter who is just learning to read for Christmas.  Easy to read and enjoyable for a 6 year old.  Would recommend.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I hate it so much. it is slow and the first time it did not install!<br />I dislike it much
B0042RJWTC|5.0|The Tudors is one of my all time favorite shows. It's beautifully filmed and well acted. Although it's not completely historically accurate, it is a lot of fun to watch and gives a good perspective of life in 16th Century England under the rule of King Henry VIII.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A very unique way to play matching. I would give it a 5 star but for myself I would enjoy it more if it didn't use hearts and dice.I do much better with single shapes. And it doesn't record your time so I never know if I've gotten better from the last time.  But I do love the 3D aspect of it. It is fun, it is challenging and I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't care about scores even though you can see the seconds flying by as your playing. It's good for doctor's office where if you have to shut it down it won't matter because it doesn't keep record. It's becoming one of my favorites.
0811821846|5.0|My five year old loves Star Wars and Cooking with me... so this was a logical choice. He loved getting his very own cookbook and he loved making wookie cookies with me in the kitchen. :)

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Everyone should view this it is great. one of the best I have seen in many years.  Will recommend for all.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Beautiful movie. The blend of American and English accents sound even spectacular.<br />If you like the romantic kinds, then this one needs to be on your dvd shelf, with 'The Notebook' and 'Love/Actually'.
0143038095|5.0|It helped our family to understand how old Asian-Americans went through their tough lives.<br />Especially, with the views of women it gave us empathy and pity for our mothers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent.  I don't want each episode to end.  I find myself thinking about these people, like I know them.  I recommend this to everyone of all ages.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|i used to have this game on my iphone so i had to get it for my kindle fire.<br />its simcity meets ign's gameboss but this is about as close as u can get to running a game company
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really good book! It was definitely one that I couldn't put down. The author did a great job establishing the characters. It's hard not to love Holder!
B005LAII1C|3.0|If you like Family Guy, you'll love this movie.  A lot of the jokes are similar to the tv show.  It's entertaining.
B003DT194G|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out and really enjoyed it but i had forgotten some of it so it was good to see it again.  It has a great story and Jason Robards is really good as usual.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|This was the funniest film I ever saw.  I still laugh every time I see it.  When a film that is over 20 years old can make you laugh when you still watch it then you have a classic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the reason this is a real a game is because of temple run which awesome. this game is good but not better and while its free you might want to get it I think its a great game probably better than temple run which is also great
B001AQT0RC|4.0|A SciFi film that stands on its own as being more about science then action is a good see.  Jodie Foster is great in this film.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|The actual stories are sometimes very different than all the films that have been produced even though I think that they are also worthwhile and fun. It's great to have the originals, the way that Conan Doyle meant them to be read and enjoyed. Definitely worthwhile.
B005NFJAMG|4.0|How can anyone not like a young Halle Berry, Kurt Russell, a 747 hijacked at 30,000 feet and oh yeah Steven Seagal killed.  You gotta love it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I am a huge Zeppelin fan and this CD and DVD is perfect.  I wish I could have been there to see it live.
1616550414|5.0|I recently received the book today and it is probably one of the coolest things I have ever bought. I been a zelda fan my entire life and the art work and concept art in this book is amazing. For only $20 this is an amazing book and even if you only a little interest in the legend of zelda it still is an amazing deal
B0086700CM|3.0|it is kinds old but now their is temple run 2 is out it is much better than temple run
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love this game! Hands down this is THE best horse game out there!!!! Great for any age horse lover out there!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I was a little afraid to buy this online, in case it was not an original canon. However, it appears to work very well, better than the cheap brands that's for sure.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Loved the book more than the movie kids should read it best book ever!!! My favourite by far read it
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|This movie felt like it never quite got there. The villian and the main crisis in the plot both left me feeling kinda meh. There wasn't enough action, or any real sense of peril for me. I know I'm not a professional critic, this is just my opinion, but the fact that at the end of the film it pops up \\"50 years, James Bond will return.\\" or some such, it almost felt like I just watched a 2.5 hour interlude to warm me up to the new \\"staff\\" at MI6 and a lead-in to the next bond film. I was bored with this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! There are  so many characters and things to buy! I can play for hours and I never get tired of it! My favorite game and my favorite app:)
0452289963|5.0|I have been reading on spirituality for about 10 years. I have not read every book, but so far this is the best book I have EVER read. It personaly helped me but the pieces of spirituality together and help me see the whole picture. It was great! practical, real life guidance. Beautiful!!
B00ABO573A|5.0|I saw a  preview then decided to rent this,  it was so scary good it reminded me of me and my ex / current boyfriend
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a classic.  Great reading for anyone.  Keeps you wanting to read more and more.  The author is great!
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always, Harry Bosch is an interesting, multi-faceted character and the plot is a good one.  Enjoyed it very much.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Average game all together. Needs better tutorial. The graphics researches are decent but could be improved for locating items needing to be found.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|{3.5 stars}<br /><br />The blurbs on the DVD box read \\"a triumph\\" (Richard Corliss, TIME), \\"nothing short of a masterpiece\\" (Jake Hamilton, KRTV/Fox), and so on. I thought, \\"That's a good sign, but they can find people to say these things about virtually ANYthing.\\" In FLIGHT's case, however, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This is one of Washington's finest 2.3 hours as alcoholic/cokehead womanizing airline pilot \\"Whip\\" Whitaker. The entire film is painstakingly directed and detailed, and the near-catastrophe is every bit as riveting as the one in ALIVE. FLIGHT also painstakingly shows the dilemmas that Whitaker, the airline unions and investigation teams, and everyone else face: There are plenty of small but effective surprises here. Despite the repetitions, dragginess, and heavy-handed moralizing in the middle, FLIGHT remains a long film that goes by very quickly.<br /><br />All that being said, the aforementioned middle portions descend way too far into a morality play/soap opera regarding Whitaker's frazzled life. Less here and more on the investigations, legalities, and effects the incident had on various other people would have made this a truly great film.
1439152802|5.0|I didn't like this book when I began reading it, but at page 244 everything changed!<br /><br />This is truly a wonderful read. Full of intrigue and suspense. Full of questions about family members.<br /><br />And well written. So very glad that I kept on reading!

0765316994|5.0|See review for the free download of Chapters 1-4 -- those are a great teaser . . . so comments are similar.  Just didn't read clearly what I was reviewing.. Great read.  Here's the other review, in case you can't find it. . .<br /><br />A hilarious romp through silly space, and the revenge of the redshirts against the leadership of the spaceship Enterprise, ooops, I mean Intruder. . . if you've ever wanted to hear what the story is behind the inglorious \\"redshirts\\" of a famous SF TV show. . . this is quite a mind and time bender. Probably not for those who don't call themselves \\"trekkies\\" or \\"trekkers\\" -- but an easy read, and tickles the funny bone. . . do read the codas at the end. . . they read like extra \\"rest of the story\\" endings.
B00006I53S|4.0|Very surprised how fast I received this. Can't wait to get out and try it out! Thanks to all the others writing reviews on this. Really helped me out.

0062183591|5.0|The truth is that we all lie and cheat. (Refusing to admit that reality is just case in point!)<br /><br />From the \\"innocent\\" white lie to the complex corporate scandal, the seeds of dishonesty lie within us all. Telling us like it honesty is, Dan explains that:<br />\\"We human beings are torn by a fundamental conflict--our deeply ingrained propensity to lie to ourselves and others, and the desire to think of ourselves as good and honest people. So we justify our dishonesty by telling ourselves stories about why our actions are acceptable and sometimes even admirable. Indeed, we're pretty skilled at pulling the wool over our own eyes.\\" (pp. 165-166)<br /><br />We're also lying to ourselves when we try to come up with explanations for the forces driving our dishonest behaviors. Although we may rationalize that we (only) lie and cheat when there is a huge benefit of gain and low risk of getting caught (this is the \\"Simple Model of Rational Crime\\" or SMORC), these forces are actually negligible. The truth is that the (irrational) forces that are most likely to increase our dishonesty behaviors include: being able to \\"creatively\\" rationalize the behavior (the \\"fudge factor theory\\"), encountering the slippery slope after doing one immoral act (the \\"what-the-hell effect\\"), feeling depleted after using our willpower to avoid previous tempting immoral acts, knowing others will benefit from our dishonesty (\\"altruistic cheating\\"), and witnessing others being dishonest.<br /><br />After revealing the dark side within us all, Dan promises there's a bright side too:<br />\\"The good news in all of this is that we are not helpless in the face of our human foibles (dishonesty included). Once we better understand what really causes our less-than-optimal behavior, we can start to discover ways to control our behavior and improve our outcomes.\\" (p. 254)<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book. Anyone who has read Dan's previous books ([[ASIN:1607513943 Predictably Irrational]] and [[ASIN:B004NSVE50 The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home]]) will not be surprised that this book is intensely fascinating, engaging, informative, and irresistible. And, anyone who has not read Dan's work yet is in for quite the treat! The man could make any topic enjoyable--and that's no lie!and [[ASIN:B004NSVE50 The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home]]) will not be surprised that this book is intensely fascinating, engaging, informative, and irresistible.

0307346617|5.0|I read this book years ago but just now am writing a review since I added it to my Zombie Fiction listmania. How can I remember it from so long ago? It was that well done.<br /><br />I started to read this book then stopped a few different times. Not because it was bad, but it was so well done it scared me. There were parts where Max wrote someone's feelings SO well that I felt the depression they felt. This book played with the mind... alot.<br /><br />Alas, I finally finished it.<br /><br />This book is horror at its finest.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is the finest 1st person version of war I have ever read. Every politician who sends young men off to war should be required to read this book before doing so. God Bless Mr. Sledge and his comrades for suffering and enduring so we all may be free.
B00004XMTJ|1.0|The last thing I expect when making a purchase having anything to do with the musical Cats is disappointment.  I was drawn to this particular DVD as it is labeled as the Commemorative Edition.  Great, I'll get even more for my dollar, right?  Sorry, not the case here.<br /><br />Having seen Cats on Broadway from the second row, the view I was expecting from this video should have been the same.  I felt the editing was poor, it seemed choppy.  There were songs missing from my stage experience.  The actual music quality was better on my old car cassette player.  With today's audio and video home equipment, my neighbors should have been calling me to turn it down.  They didn't because the music was worse than the sounds of alley cats down in any City.<br /><br />Since they did not try to change this DVD into a movie like Hollywood does with many Broadway hits, I was looking for a video of the Broadway show.<br /><br />This DVD failed to deliver on so many levels.  We had been so excited..... Hopefully my warning will allow you to skip our disappointment.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Originally bought another brand from the store where I purchased my Kindle, had them both about 2.5 weeks and the Kindle popped out of the case and hit the floor breaking the screen!!! Guess where that case went? You guessed it...back to the store where I bought it from! The reason I chose this one is because we have 3 other Kindles all in these cases. I will never buy another brand of case, THANK YOU for making a quality case at an affordable price. Signed one happy customer...
B00005V9QJ|4.0|enjoyed this album but already have so many cds with the same songs. should have maybe checked out the songs before ordering.  she's a talented artist and have enjoyed her music for hears
B000002AGN|5.0|A terrific CD, even for people who don't know they like jazz. This recording is as great today as it was forty years ago.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|bought this as a birthday gift for my sister. i already have this album and it's one of my favorites. upbeat and nice to listen to while driving. wakes you up.
0374214913|5.0|I loved this quirky and charming book. I won't try to explain the plot, which you can read about elsewhere. It's the characters that stay with me. Mr Penumbra a 'shady' character with a bookstore where no-one buys books. The narrator, young, jobless and drawn to the bookstore in spite of himself. His friends, computer geeks all, who help solve a Da Vinci-type mystery against the clock. Google is strongly featured. I felt better for reading it and am convinced that the author is a kind and funny man who loves his characters. As well he might.
B0002X314C|5.0|especially enjoy the song &#34;get lifted&#34; and &#34;ordinary people&#34;. this album is relaxing and nice to listen to anytime. smooth vocals from john legend as always.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed this very clever mystery. It's well written, cleverly plotted, gripping, and somewhat unpredictable. By which I mean that I guessed the answer before the end, but only on a hunch. It's been an enormous hit, and I can see why. Recommended for Tana French fans.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|This is a good, classic CD of popular hits, and I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates the great sounds of Garfunkel.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Perfect for those who need different wake times for different days.  I love that I can set my own music choice and the snooze feature is easy even without my glasses
B000005DQR|1.0|Hey all...its me,CALI HIP HOPPER Yeah so in case you couldn't tell amazon kept deleting all my comments because i had some choice words for all the haters out here talking trash. So im baaaaack this time with a new profile and some new choice words for all the (expletive ) haters out there. i'll try and keep it clean this time so you guys get my jist.  By the way just a word to all the haters....amazon made these albums reviewable so people with different stand points could share their views about movies and music and other products...i don't however understnd why they made it so idiots could \\"comment\\" on other people's reviews...i mean if you don't agree with a review than you simply don't agree with it and you can leave you own review to show that you don't agree with so and so's reveiw , but why on gods green earth they made it possible to comment on the opinions of others is still beyond me. I don't like people insulting me just because of my opinion .... i mean they would bad mouth me and when i would try to redeem myself ... amazon would delete the comment becuz i was extremely passionate and stood by my word. Anyways bottom line the album sucked hard and no number of comments on it would ever lead me to change my mind for any reason. deal with it. peace ...its not just about drumm and bass, or genres...the album just sucked.  deal with it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love the ending paints a big picture story line fun to read looking forward to the next one can't wait
0312966199|4.0|I bought it to read to my children ages 11, 10, 8, and 7.  Although the stories are very entertaining, there are a lot of words or phrases that are hard for the kids to understand.  I have to stop reading, a lot, and explain things to them, so they get the gist of it.  Other than that, it's a great book.  It's very funny and filled with adventures.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Its a great game but I don't like that you have to be in the same Wifi connection as someone to be able to play mutiplayer. I also don't like that they don't have the saddles :( I want to ride a pig :/ In creative mode there is like NO mobs and you cant even create them. The last thing I hope they add in is being able to tame animals. I LOVE to have a whole house full of animals xD but its hard for me to do when I cant get them to follow me. This game is really fun besides all this and I would suggest it to anyone who just wants to build or kill mobs xD
B00A80SHFM|4.0|This cd is exactly like the movie.  I loved the movie, but thought that the cd would be the same songs sung by the same actors, but in a studio, without some of the movie parts.  It's still good though.

B00AAI4W4M|5.0|Just a quick note here, the other two reviews at the time of this posting cover the product very nicely.  The train is great, but it can be bought direct from Lego for $129.99.  The price listed here at the time of this posting is $155.00

B0086700CM|5.0|When I first got this game, I didn't find it that impressive. However, I got bored one day and decided to start playing it, and boy is it addicting. The main concept of the game is to run away from a monkey who is going to hurt you. There is an awesome tutorial so you are up to speed on how to play in seconds. The game runs great and there is barely any lag. Great gameplay and fun to play while watching TV. Must download for mobile users!
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I just spent 15 bucks on this. I want to watch this on my computer because my wifi is terrible. It says \\"Also available in Standard Definition\\", but it is not. This is extremely frustrating.
B005R32L66|4.0|Skype would definitely be nice to have on your phone to use, but this just doesn't cut it. Despite the efforts to bring a full Skype experience to your phone, you just can't. Therefore, this version will miss out on some of your favorite features from the desktop version. For casual users this is perfect, but if you use Skype often and need something that you can rely on for permanent Skyping, don't go with the mobile version alone, get the desktop version as well.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Spoiler alert!<br /><br />The ending left you wondering if there will be a sequel to the 4th sequel. Worth watching, but don't expect a whole lot of action and intensity until a ways into the movie
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app comes packed with a great array of features that make it a mobile app. If you use the Kindle service to buy books then this is perfect. Download this app on all of your devices and you can easily read on the go and have your data synced. But remember, this app is only useful if you use Kindle books. Great to have though!
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I had technical problems with buffering with  the pilot,but the rest of the series has been fine and very entertaining
B006WQLH7G|5.0|avast! is probably the best choice for security on not only your Android device, but also your PC. The program is super-easy to use and it does a great job of scanning what it has to. Works excellent on the Galaxy S3 for safegaurding your phone. Highly recommended for anyone running Android who might be worried about their security being compromised.<br /><br />I'm hoping for an iOS version soon!
1476712042|5.0|I LOVED this book . Its A page turner. I was sad when its all over. I cant wait to get Walking Disaster .
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It is a perfect fast sad and happy girl book.<br />This is pulp at its best.
B009GX6600|5.0|Super Story lines that are suspenseful and super actors working together as a team.  I Love it.  They showed a little about Gibbs 1st wife but have not explained why the wife and daughtr were killed - were they targeted by the Cartel or caught in a crossfire.  Hope they will bring closure to story line.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Yes, I was late to the game on this one.  Part of the reason was a bit of aversion to over-saturation of DKG around the time this was published.  I quite regret now that I decided not to read this at the time it was originally published and only picked this up after seeing the movie \\"Lincoln\\".  Wow, history doesn't get much better than this.  While I've read several biographies on Lincoln and books on the Civil War era, none is as mesmerizing as \\"Team of Rivals\\".<br /><br />I'll state that my favorite biography is Robert Caro's \\"Power Broker\\", a character study of one of the most influential non-elected officials and his pure \\"political\\" genius.  While not a biography per se, \\"TOR\\" captures the absolute political genius of Abraham Lincoln.  From his surprise victory at the 1860 Republican convention, his chief rivals, Seward, Chase and Bates, all underestimated his uncanny ability to pull his rivals together and outmaneuver those who'd been \\"in the game\\" much longer than he was.  They assumed this backcountry lawyer didn't possess the cunning skill.  As they witnessed it first hand as part of his cabinet, the reluctantly began to recognize Lincoln's unmatched capabilities and even project forward how he would transcend his era and become one of the greatest of American figures.<br /><br />Goodwin brings to life these personalities with such precision and clarity that the reader is transported back in time so that you feel like you are in the cabinet room with these historical figures.  I felt as if I was sitting around the table listening to the cabinet debate witnessing Lincoln deftly navigate the egos and politics to hold an unlikely group together.<br /><br />Behind the machinations of Lincoln and his cabinet, DKG paints the picture of Lincoln and his evolving views on the Union, slavery, emancipation that demythologizes the larger than life figure too often hidden in pithy textbooks and short magazine articles.<br /><br />Even for those who aren't inclined to history, this will captivate and engage in a way the best novels do.  Certainly, mass media and the 24x7 real-time news cycle has transformed the landscape and to be able to relive such a momentous and critical juncture of our history through a different context and prism is invaluable.  I'm grateful to DKG for delivering such a remarkable work of history.story, this will captivate and engage in a way the best novels do.

0738710261|5.0|I like everything about this deck. It's perfect to carry anywhere. I also like the simple, woodcut type of images. If you know Tarot, there is really no guess work as is sometimes the case with extremely busy cards. Sometimes it's just more convenient to have these smaller cards when space is at a minimum. I love this deck!

B0031RAOVY|1.0|When I heard there was a DVD to be released about the famous Japanese dog Hachiko, I was elated!  I had always heard about the tale of Chuken Hachiko (\\"faithful Hachiko\\") as a child from my mother, essentially a Japanese version of the Scottish Greyfriars Bobby.  I eagerly bought the DVD and planned to have this as a cherished dog film for my collection.  (Spoilers ahead.)<br /><br />My husband and I sat down to watch, eager to see a heart-warming tale.  At first, we were aghast when Hachi was forced to sleep in a shed outside the family home!  No cushion for a bed, no dog sleeping indoors by the hearth.  So much for showing the family dog affection.  After the professor dies, loyal Hachi keeps waiting at the train statiOn for him to return home.  When the dog is finally found by the professor's wife, if I recall, I was hoping she would take him home and keep him in a secure home or yard.  And then she leaves him to run loose as a stray!  Not even an attempt to bring him home!  The final straw for me was with the professor's son and daughter-in-law, who really did not care about the dog. (Or was it a daughter and son-in-law?  The film was not memorable for me.  I chose to forget.)<br /><br />Maybe this was the true story of Hachiko, and his family who let him run loose as a stray dog, only to die in streets of cancer and worms, but I was looking for (because of the contemporary American setting and cast) a modern take on a loyal dog.  I wanted some revisionism and a happy, bittersweet ending.<br /><br />This film was really a missed opportunity to show just how to love and care for a dog.  Hachi's love and loyalty were repaid with neglect and abandonment.<br /><br />After watching this film, I was thoroughly disturbed and disgusted as a dog lover.  It was not about Hachi, but about his self-absorbed family who really didn't care about him.

B00683JK9K|4.0|I have worked four of the puzzles so far and haven't had any of the problems some reviewers have mentioned. I'm playing on the Kindle Fire 8.9  I have experienced a little bit of jumpiness when I'm dragging pieces from the right side, but that's all.<br /><br />I don't know why it says you need Adobe Air because I don't have that program and it works anyway.  I expected it to tell me I needed it when I downloaded the app and just downloaded the app without searching the store for the Air app.  Who knows?<br /><br />I've had other puzzle apps of this type and this one seems the best so far.

B0009A40ES|5.0|American Psycho (film) Review<br />By Ryan Blackburn<br /><br /> American Psycho was released on the big screens in America in April of 2000. Much like its brother in print, the film was criticized for its graphic sexual and violent content. The film has a cult following and boasts four stars on the International Movie Database.<br /> With Christian Bale starring as Patrick Bateman, the film features only one known star. While Bale was a star in 2000, his fame then was nothing compared to the fame he has today. After the Batman trilogy and the Terminator, and Terminator: Judgment Day movies, it is easy to forget Christian Bale even starred in American Psycho.<br /> While Bale's resume may have higher grossing films and critically acclaimed roles, his portrayal of the sociopathic Patrick Bateman should not be overlooked. Bale worked extremely hard on his adaptation of the role, including demanding physical exercise. This was necessary to portray Patrick Bateman's intense narcissistic obsession with fitness and shallow vanity. I liked Bale as Bateman; it may be his most perfect role. He is capable of being the handsomely beautiful man on the big screen that Patrick Bateman is described as in the book. He has the range of being able to shift from perfect etiquette to murderer flawlessly.<br />Some novels are never meant to be made into films, it is impossible for their creativity and uniqueness to translate well to the big screen. Christian Bale saves American Psycho from falling into this category. Bale is capable of flashing that evil behind his eyes that actually makes you believe he feels the bloodlust you're seeing. I read the novel before I saw the movie, and like all readers I was hesitant to see the movie, fearing it would not adapt well. Thankfully this was not the case.<br /> American Psycho is not perfect however. It is far from it. The transition between scenes was excellent, as was the overall camera work. The portrayal and critique of \\"yuppie\\" culture that appears in the novel is presented well. But the character of Patrick Bateman is inconsistent. During most of the movie, Bateman is a cold, evil, invincible force. In the end of the movie, Bateman's final, moving scene is a shot with him on the phone in tears, confessing his crimes. He then attends a dinner party in which he confronts the very person he confesses his crimes to, only to be mistaken for someone else, and his confession is assumed as nothing more than a joke. This is where much of the idea that the entire story of Patrick Bateman is a madman's illusions, suggesting that it was all made up. The film differs greatly from the novel here. In the novel's ending, the reader is not left with this depiction of Bateman. He continues on with his sociopathic ways. The movie produces even less of a legitimate ending, only suggesting that the story was made up. This is where I could perceive a change in the movie making it much better, solidifying the storyline instead of castrating it.<br /> I would have to recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of Christian Bale, or unique thriller movies. There is quite a lot of wit written into the dialogue throughout the movie, making even the most bloodless scenes enjoyable.

B003Z0BWR2|5.0|When i started reading this trilogy i was doubtful of the popularity this book had since the person who told me to read it was comparing it to twilight for some reason. I'll just say that if you hate twilight, try reading this book, twilight is like an ant to this god of a book.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Unlike other people who give lower ratings due to there own experiences and excuses. I however did enjoy this game. The game is really fun and does get.a little more challenging as you progress, but are not impossible. Very funny when you get so far and then end up crashing.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Highly recommended for any  music lover.<br />Thriller became—and currently remains—the best-selling album of all time, with sales estimated by various sources as being between 51 and 65 million copies worldwide.[4][5][6][Note 1] In the United States, it also tied with the Eagles's Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) as the best-selling album at 29 millions shipped.[7] The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys.

And I haven't noticed a change in my battery life due to this app. And don't forget, It's FREE!!!!
B00ANW33CM|1.0|The point of mah jong is not so much speed as focus and concentration. This game turns it into a speed trial. Its also incredibly annoying to have to rotate the board constantly to find tiles. Not to mention the graphics are dizzying. Uninstalling.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|great family story ,many learning lessons , fun to watch and even scarty at moments , parents and children can learn if they watch
B002VECM4A|5.0|The book was was more detailed than the movie but that is not a bad thing.  The book shows how hard some people work to get their life straighten out and make something of themselves.  If this woman could do what she did after the terrible young life that she had, a person can do anything. I think it was very insprirational.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Ex lent movie full of humor action love . A great display of character. It is good to see more movies about Jesus .
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I was browsing for a good book to read and came across this one. Let me say I was extremely disappointed. This book is not even worth the space it takes up on my kindle. Please see the other one star reviews and don't pay attention to the supposedly good reviews.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I absolutely despise mornings and always have a hard time waking up.  this app actually helps make sure I get up; the option to make it harder to just hit the snooze button has come in handy more than once!  don't know how I would get up in time without it!

B001N1DPDE|3.0|This is too klunky to be a woking utilty/survival knife. It reminded me of a chopping knife for the kitchen. The product looked well made and the coating on the knife was gritty and appeared durable. The problems that I forsee while using this is its weight, balance and sharpness. Even with its coating I wonder how it would be able to be resharpened.

B003V9OCS8|5.0|This is an excellent mountainering movie with an engrossing storyline and great cinematography.  It is based on a true story.  Normally, I do not like foreign films due to the subtitles however they did not detract from this movie at all.  Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys climbing/mountaineering movies or just a great film.
0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a powerful book and brilliant summation of the actual man that our sixteenth president really was. In school and throughout our lives, we have been taught and told that Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest of American presidents; he was the president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and held the country together as one nation.  However, in this compelling and fascinating biography I have discovered that Lincoln was of greater depth than I ever read about in school.<br /><br />Kearns-Goodwin offers a portrait of a man who was multi-faceted as man of morals, conviction, a wonderful storyteller as well as a shrewd politician and stubborn tenacity. This book paints a portrait of Lincoln through the lens of the diverse men, his political rivals, that he surrounded himself with in his Cabinet.<br /><br />I already held Lincoln in great esteem and after reading this biography I truly came to I did come to love and admire him for his audacity and shrewdness in surrounding himself with opposing personal advisers.<br /><br />The outstanding book does an admirable job of showing the nuances of the internal conflicts that Lincoln navigated during social and political turmoil of that time in Americxan history. I loved Kearns style of writing, she has constructed a wonderful history lesson that was quite readable. Team of Rivals is hands down one of the finest non-fiction, historical books that I have ever read.
B0061S073A|5.0|this app allows you to put only the apps you want on the screen. we put all our kid friendly apps there. it also allows you to turn off internet access when in Kids Place, so your child won't accidentally buy something while playing a game. it's just what we need to let our 3 and 5 yr old have some time on the kindle.

B0099116AY|4.0|Good movie, entertaining and recommended. 1 star less because the sound track was meant for some other teenage movie. The great moments are all spoiled by songs that are completely shallow (for this very mature and entertaining movie). Great movie, lousy inappropriate sound track.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|The item came quickly and in perfect shape.  I really like this music - it is unique and contagious immediately.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I watched his pre-concert at the theaters on February 7th.  It was great to see him sing the new songs live.  I really like the CD specially 'Falling Slowly' and 'Happy on my Heartache.'. His Spanish is flawless as usual and the songs are wonderful.<br /><br />I am not a singer but in my humble opinion, you never lose when you buy a CD from Josh!

B00133KFGW|5.0|This truly is the best movie I have ever seen. It is easily my favorite. It is just so sweet and touching, with a powerful message. Freddie Highmore is an incredible actor who plays the part so well. I got lost in this movie and the story plays in my head all the time. I think of this film every day and I love the story. It really is the best movie I've ever watched. I'm thirteen and really into Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, the whole shebang. But this movie spoke to me and I was captivated. My dad is very emotional and was crying the whole time. So sad, but so great. I love this movie, and you will too.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|Even though it is free it is not worth the time to use the app - waste of time -
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Slow moving at times but an overall good movie.  Kristen Stewart plays Snow White and I'm not a big fan of hers; however, Charlize Theron does an excellant acting job!  Wouldn't let small kids watch it but it's a good movie.
B0072OFM28|5.0|liam mc intyre did a marvelous job filling the late andy whitfields role as spartacus, tho we all miss andy very much.  lucy lawless was super, as was the rest of original cast., and my only regret  is that it was more than  thirty minutes shorter than &#34;blood and sand&#34;.
B006VRZ5YM|3.0|The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I can't really remember what the movie was about.  Maybe that should tell you something.

0765325950|5.0|I was a college freshman when Robert Jordan first published Eye of the World.  Having no extra money, I had to wait until Christmas to read it.  Little did I know it would begin a tradition that spanned 22 years of my life - reading a Wheel of Time book every Christmas.  Even in the years when new adventures weren't published, I would go back and reread the series.  Sure at times the story got off track and meandered, but I never understood the complaint.  Who really wanted this series to end ?  Who really wanted to leave this immersive world and the characters they had followed for over two decades.<br /><br />Well, the series is finally over - and it took a long, strange path to get here.  Mr. Jordan's passing shook me more than a stranger's death should, but his care for his fans and readers - that he should share his world and notes with another to finish the tale - was a wonderful gift.  Sanderson did more than I ever imagine he could.  His style, his care, his passion - all worked wonderfully to finish the series in a tone that fit seamlessly with Jordan's books, yet with a sense of purpose and urgency that were missing a bit in the middle of the series.  To read the last chapter, knowing it was written by Jordan himself, brought a sense of true finality to this series.<br /><br />I understand the frustration of all the \\"1 star for no Ebook\\" reviews, but I can't help but think their chosen method of protest is childish.  If you care enough about the series to be so upset that like a baby, you can't have what you want immediately but have to wait 4 whole months, why sabotage it ?  Based on the book itself, it was a solid 5 start effort - heroic sacrifice, grueling confrontation, and an interesting resolution.  Sure several of the deaths were heartbreaking, but there was some solace [Spoiler Alert?] knowing the Wheel continued to turn and they were all destined for another chance.  I hope Mr. Jordan is enjoying his next turn on the Wheel.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|While this CD took a few listens to grow on me it is in heavy rotation now.  The 'New Acoustic&#34; music really satisfies!!!

030758836X|4.0|This was my first Flynn novel.<br />I really enjoyed her writing style.<br />Gone Girl is a real page turner, I must admit I thought<br />the ending really sucked, great until the end.<br />so much thought and planning went into the story<br />and the end was just silly.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great, new mellow sound.  Very enjoyable to listen to.  Looking forward to their next album and seeing them live.  Good variety in the music.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This was a fun and easy book to read. I would recommend it to anyone trying to become more grateful!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was hilarious and had me laughing to the point of tears several times. I really enjoyed her writing and how the memoir was intermixed with her internal monologue about the events.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My husband and I watched this series from the Library and enjoyed it immensely.  Bought the series for our Granddaughters for Chrisrmas ages 11 and 13.  They have completed the series as I write this and enjoyed it more then we did.  It is a great story and lesson teaching for young adults.  It was well worth the money and I know they will watch it again in the future.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I've not encountered the missing piece issue.  I think you can find missing pieces under the finished section.  I wish that you could lock the completed section (frame?) because I keep accidentally grabbing and moving it. I also wish you could save progress to come back to a started but not completed puzzle.  I also wish it would mark the puzzles that have already been worked.  Perhaps based on difficulty?<br /><br />Otherwise it is a great game it is entertaining and relaxing. I'm enjoying it very much!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoy reading about the near death experiences.  Although this book sometimes was hard to follow, I enjoyed the descriptions and experiences of this person between here and there.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this subject.
B004P4KMSC|5.0|My two year old plays with this and many other Bruder trucks.  He loves playing in the snow with them right now, and in the house with some small practice golf balls.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great puzzling game for all ages!  It is a fun way to get kids thinking about physics. Adults love it too. Be prepared to become obsessed with the game!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This thing has great range and sounds very good.  Keep the volume at 4.  I'm using a new USB3 Crucial 32GB stick.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|My kids and I love playing this puzzler game. Great graphics and you get an opportunity to redo levels if you haven't earned enough stars to unlock new levels. We totally recommend this game for all ages!
B00260GLBO|5.0|My two year old plays with this and many other Bruder trucks.  He loves playing in the snow with them right now, and in the house with some small practice golf balls.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very fun game slightly addictive too although becomes quite repetitive the more you play. Taking that into account four stars is my only option.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|straight to the point, fantastic app. i use it in my classes as a notebook replacement, it gets the job done. i only wish there was more customization, with fonts and such
B005MJ883K|5.0|This has been hours of fun for members of my family of all ages! It never gets boring! Love it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest os a great way to get new ideas for food and stuff like that. There is lots of different genres of pictures. you can post pictures, like pictures, comment on pictures and re pin other pictures.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I loved this book as a child and I still do, it is the classic tale, book one of the series.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I saw the first one when it came out. The first one was impressive, however the remake left an impression. Remakes tend not to be as good as the first. I have to say it was better! Action packed, graphics are amazing! Kept me engrossed the entire time.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I give this a 4-star rating because my kids absolutely love playing it, but they get a little bored with the repetition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I love this series. I love this author. The Wool universe rivals anything I have ever read and this is all coming from an independent author! I wholeheartedly endorse this book and this author to anyone and everyone. The premise and setting of Wool is interesting, dark, and detailed. The characters are believable and relatable. The politics and the fear and paranoia they cause stick with you and you won't want to put this down until you have finished. Don't worry, though, Mr. Howey has so far proven himself to be a prolific writer and has continued to expand the Wool universe. Might as well buy the Shift omnibus while you are at it...you will end up wanting to read it after this.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am not too great at playing this, but my kids really like playing it on my Kindle Fire. It seems rather repetitious, so I don't play it long.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Love the series, very entertaining and thought provoking.<br />Left me wanting more and look forward to reading more by Collins.
B007SGM084|5.0|Though I don't have time to read very often, I absolutely love curling up with this on my Kindle Fire! What a sexy book!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I love this app.  I like to know when it's the full moon and the new moon.  This app gives me advance notice of peak times for these 2 events, plus way more than I'll ever use.  Great app.
B006S08RLU|4.0|I hadnt seen this movie in a while so it was nice to watch it again thru amazon. Its a great choice for girl's night in movie. It makes you appreciate the coincidences in life. I like the optimistic view on life and love. The only thing i didnt like about renting it from amazon is i watched it on a 15 in. screen Mac and i thought the resolution of the movie was not very good in some parts.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This movie was gripping and I thought a great compliment to the other movies. Bale was a GREAT Batman and all the complimentary characters/actors were right on. My only complaint is that I wish they were continuing the series with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Batman because there are sooo many more bad guy characters in the Batman story to explore.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Was using a Phenom II X4 840 prior to this (which was missing an L3 Cache). That L3 Cache makes quite a difference. Also, overclocking is pretty simple with this little guy.<br /><br />Made a noticeable difference despite the clock speeds between the two processors (840 and 965) were still pretty close.<br /><br />Some say that this series is going out of style, but if you do not have the option to get an AM3+ processor, this processor should do exactly what you need it to do, without putting a dent in your wallet. Only thing I can find is that this processor runs a bit hotter than the old one ( but the old one was using 95W as opposed to this one which is a 125W).
1451627297|5.0|I like a lot of different kinds of books and have many different interests. So it's no surprise that my \\"To Be Read\\" pile is much taller than my nearly 6-foot-frame. However, very few books contain as many of my top interests as Stephen King's latest book released at the end of 2011, \\"11/22/63.\\" I love Stephen King books. I have been extremely interested in the assassination of John F. Kennedy since I was a teenager. And I love time travel stories. This book combines all three, so I had high hopes going into my reading of \\"11/22/63.\\" I was not disappointed.<br /><br />If you are only a fan of King's horror novels, you might be sad to know this book does not fit in that genre at all. This one is more science fiction, with a healthy dose of historical fiction and alternative history. However, even if you have never read any of King's non-horror titles, you must give \\"11/22/63\\" a try.<br /><br />High school English teacher Jake Epping is comfortable, if somewhat unhappy, in his mundane life in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He is recently divorced from his alcoholic wife when his life hits one of those \\"watershed moments.\\" In addition to teaching high school English, Jake also teaches GED classes at the school. When he asks his class to write about a moment that changed their lives, he is surprised to discover a heart-wrenching story behind the slow-witted school janitor who is working toward his diploma.<br /><br />Two years later, Jake is summoned to the local diner by the owner, Al Templeton. Al shares a deep secret with Jake -- In the storeroom of the diner is a portal that links to 1958. All you have to do is step through the portal and you will be transported to Sept. 9, 1958 at 11:58 AM. No matter when you step through or how long you are gone before you return, the next time you step through the portal, it will be Sept. 9, 1958 at 11:58 AM. According to Al, there are two limitations. First, no matter how long you are gone, when you come back, only two minutes will have passed in the present. And secondly, each time you go back to the past, there is a reset. It's 11:58 a.m., and everything you did on your previous trip has been erased.<br /><br />Al tells Jake he has just returned from spending four years in the past because he is dying of cancer and needs to pass on his secret before he dies. Besides imparting this secret to Jake, Al also wants to transfer his mission to his friend -- stopping the assassination of John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />Assuming a new identity, Jake -- now known as George Amberson -- sets about righting the wrongs of the past, with the goal of building a better future. But he finds that the past doesn't always want to be changed, or as Jake/George says, the past is obdurate, and you can't always predict what the future will hold.<br /><br />I have often wondered about how time travel would work if it were a reality. What would the ripple effects be of even the most minute change to the past? How would simply your presence in the past affect the future? King takes some of the expected steps as he tells his tale of Jake/George traversing the barriers of time and space, but he also throws in some unexpected twists. At its heart, \\"11/22/63\\" is much more than a time travel story. It is a story of love, loss, free will and destiny. King makes you think and wrenches your heart as he leads Jake/George through his adventure.<br /><br />King has said he originally had the idea for this story when he was still working as a full-time teacher, so he didn't have the time for the comprehensive research necessary to bring the late 1950s/early 1960s to life as fully as he has in \\"11/22/63.\\" I am very glad that he eventually got back around to this story and has written one of his best works in decades.<br /><br />Even though the book is more than 800 pages long, I was sad when the story reached its end. I wanted to read more about Jake/George and his story. At the end of the day, shouldn't that be true of any well-written story.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 5, I give \\"11/22/63\\" a 5.
B005HSL626|4.0|I downloaded this game for my son and he loves it.  I didn't think I was going to care for it but it is fun and very addictive.
0545265355|5.0|I waited until I'd finished the trilogy before responding with my rating.  I was super impressed by the series.  I now have no desire to see the movies.  I like the pictures in my mind better than any movie could imagine.  What a wonderful suspenseful series....  Well worth the read!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son loves the additions in this version.  Very addicting game but it is so much fun.  I would recommend it.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|This CD was good, not great, but I'm not disappointed that I bought it.  I've always been a big Rod fan & he still has a great voice.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game takes skills because it moves to fast but it is so much fun.  My son plays this for hours.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books Ive ever read. Brilliantly written, both the story and the time frame in which its told. Make me wonder what my husbands really might be thinking. Nothing is ever as it seems. Great book!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The video was excellent!  What we really enjoyed the most was the behind the scenes discs, and the Directors Disc showing exactly how the film was made.  More of this with a collection bodes well with us.  We like to see the making of.............
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it doesn't  freeze or go black.<br />And I love it.It is the  best game in the world.
B003UESJHE|5.0|This disc was exactly what we thought it would be.  We have bought many video disc from Amazon, and found them always in good shape, and well worth the money spent.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love everything about the books and the HBO series. Sadly it lakes Goerge r.r. Martin about five years to put out a book and he leaves you on tenterhooks
B005GVW05Q|5.0|My all time favorite Ryan Adams album is &#34;Love Is Hell&#34; but this one is just about as good.  He writes such interesting songs, I think he's an amazing talent.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|As a disclaimer, I'm an older guy, but I do love Pixar films. I feel they have a great mix of a good story, great voice-acting, and animation that is always pushing the industry forward.<br /><br />All-in-all, the film isn't bad. The acting and animation are what you'd expect from a Pixar film (and that's good). I just don't know that this storyline is as good as it could be. Don't get me wrong, a &#34;good&#34; Pixar film is still far-better than a lot of the other animated films out there.
0446547573|5.0|This was one of the best Nicholas Sparks books out there! I own most of his books and have read many of them and yet, this one really sticks out to me. The ending was such a shocker for me and it made me tear up. Amazing work, really amazing. I'm still in awe of how in the world he came up with such wonderful characters and such an enticing plot. Everything came together in a perfect blend and it was a sort of melting pot of genres thrown into one superb book. Definetely recommend to anyone and everyone wanting to get hooked onto a book for a day or two :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows I have seen! It is  better than a Historical novel because I can actually see it. I love the time period and being able to become part of the lives of the people there. I also like seeing the differences and alikeness of the entire household including the servants. I hope this show continues for a long time! I would and do recommend this show to all!<br />Zaida Ringheimer
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was so excited to get this season before the entire season had been aired on PBS. The DVDs are in excellent condition.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My daughter started using this around 7 months very efficiently.  She learned quickly to turn it in full circles and would put her stuffed animals in the oval handle and push them around the house.  It is light enough for my petite little girl to run with and the balance is spot on.  She had another one given to her but it was back-heavy and she couldn't lean on it and fell a lot.  She is 15 months now and doesn't need it, but she still like to grab it once in a while and run into peoples legs for a good reaction.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|There are very few movies that can come close to great novels.<br />This may be one of them.<br />I am a huge fan of the book having read it several times.<br />I was also skeptical, as were many, of the film even coming close to the book.<br />Rest assured, you won't be disappointed.<br />As to the haters on this site, I can only wonder if they came into this with preconceived notions of disliking it.<br />Boring?<br />No way.<br />Questioning the belief in God?<br />Get over yourself, really?<br />When I first read the book, I thought the beginning, detailing Pi's exploration of the three religions, rather ponderous.<br />But I got over it and rather enjoy that part of the book (and movie) now.<br />As an atheist, it didn't matter what he finally settled on.<br />The movie is a wonderous experience, and I can't wait to get it on DVD.<br />Even though my eight year old cried at every scene with an animal dying.<br />I thought he'd like ole Richard Parker but didn't factor in the killing aspect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So awsome love it cause the different worlds and carachters hope u get it i like it better than temple run
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show. thats it. if you like the zombie genre then you will love this.<br /><br />watch it<br /><br />(warning: its gory)
B001A5HBJC|4.0|I've always hated Mad Men. I never had to spend even five minutes with the show to know I wouldn't like it.<br /><br />This seems almost paradoxical, seeing as how the show consists of elements that I love and have so longed to see in popular entertainment. From everything I heard, it was a mature, character-driven drama that strips away the sepia-toned nostalgia of a bygone time in America, addressing the racism, sexism and other eyebrow-furrowing quirks of the 1960s.<br /><br />Not to mention the fact it stars Jon Hamm and Cristina Hendricks, who have both won me over in their own ways. I've never seen much of Hamm's actual work as an actor, but I've witnessed him handsome his way through interviews, and I can't deny his charm is undeniable. And Hendricks? I've been in love with her since I first got a glimpse of her talent in \\"Firefly.\\"<br /><br />So, by all accounts, it seems like this is something I would instantly fall in love with, if only I would give it the chance, like how I felt in high school every time a girl laughed before saying she had \\"other plans\\" Friday night.<br /><br />\\"But, that's stupid,\\" you say out loud to yourself as you read this, \\"why would you form an opinion about something you haven't experienced?\\"<br /><br />\\"The same reason I never leave the house and don't trust the young people,\\" I respond. \\"I'm an old man.\\"<br /><br />The reason I had never before given the show a chance was because of my friend, Dalton, who has been obsessed with the show since it first premiered, has pestered me about checking it out since day one, and, just because I knew it would drive him crazy, I've stayed as far away from it as possible.<br /><br />Well, I finally watched it. And I loved it. And I hate that I loved it<br /><br />Why? Because now I'm forced to face the fact that Dalton was right all along, and, despite my best efforts, I've been won over.<br /><br />Watching the first episode of the series, \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,\\" was a great and painfulexperience, because I wanted it to fail and I wanted the credits to roll and be able to text him and brag about how much it sucked. But I couldn't. And I hated it.<br /><br />I hated the incredible performances and deeply-drawn characters that sucked me in and made me care. I hated the well-structured plot that had me anticipating how it would all get resolved. I hated the detailed scenery, I hated the wonderful  costumes, I hated the beautiful framing for the striking visuals.<br /><br />I hated everything that made me love it, and now I hate myself because I'm looking forward to more.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|This album is truly a &#34;Best Of&#34; when so many albums claim to be and disappoint. Its tough financially to replace all my vinyl records, 8 tracks and cassettes with CDs so I've compromised by buying &#34;Best Of&#34; CDs. This is one purchase that fits the bill!
0689835604|5.0|My son LOVES this book so much!  The last page of the book has a baby under a big blanket flap that you lift up.  I started asking, &#34;Where's the baby?!?!&#34;  He enthusiastically flips the flap up to show the baby!!  If I randomly ask, &#34;Where's the baby?!&#34;, he looks all over for the book, as he associates it with the baby under the blanket.  He's not the most gentle with it and I've had to glue one flap back on, but he enjoys this book so much that it's ok! =)
074356619X|5.0|Some of it seemed like a corny self help book, but if you're open minded and actually pay attention to what they're saying, IT WILL HELP.  The law of attraction exists and works if you want it to.  You may not get everything you want in life, but this will teach you how a positive attitude can make you feel like did.  And in the end that's all that really matters.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|YES its an amazing headset to buy. if your a gamer and want a nice headset with a great price this is the one to get. I bought this one as a back up too my other headset and I honestly use this one a lot more often then the other one i have. totally worth it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best games that I have ever played!!Love it!!!!!!! The game takes a little while to load but worth the wait.
B005Q1W10A|3.0|I received the DVD yesterday and will be returning it for the second time to try to get one that works.  The DVD plays for about 45-50 minutes then stops.  I love this series, so will keep trying to get a set of DVDs that works all the way through.
1400049628|5.0|If you love the Walking Dead on AMC, you will love this book.  It really is a good read and well worth the time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Writing could have been better, but great trilogy. It has my recommendation. Great book to read on a kindle, so no one knows you're reading it. Or else I'd be blushing more!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love this game..you can build your very own fish tank.Then you play your own game .fish &amp; jewels ,what more could you ask for.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  Had to watch it twice to fully under stand every thing in it.  Thank you for the movies
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have been a fan of Big Bang since Season One.  It is funny, has great storylines and I learn science in the process.  The actors are engaging anfd endearing!  I highly recommend it!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book hooks you pretty much right from the start, whereas Maze Runner is a bit slow to get going.  It does slow a bit in the middle but keeps you interested and guessing through til the end.  I have also read Hunger Games, Legend, and Divergent (which is my favorite of all 4)recently and this series is probably the last of the 4 series' but still an enjoyable and worth while read!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very detailed and showed the raw feelings of both sides of s and m...or bondage. I could never gone as far as the woman in this book did but it goes to show us how much we are willing to endure for love or the hope of love.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|Very fun read,much like twilight....a little less intensity in The characters. Cole turned out to Be my favourite character .  Would have been good to have Beck reveal more of himself. Entertaining,over To soon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is better than temple run because it has better graphics and instead of a swamp it is in the sky with more booby traps and a giant demon monkey
B00000IQMT|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was amazingly intriguing. Gregory Roberts is an excellent writer. I would definitively recommend this book.<br />This book captured my imagination like no other that I've read.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Even though the title says &#34;Highlights&#34;, we thought the compilation would be a selection of the best songs from the movie. Unfortunatly, the studio cut some tracks in half, lessening the experience that could be enjoyed by 'Les Mis' lovers. It would be better to miss out on tracks like &#34;Attack of the Barricade&#34; and complete traks that hilight the talent of the singers.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is my favorite book ever. It is so wonderfully written and so beautiful. Charlie is so sweet and charming. Made me tear up and cry a little it was so innocent and sad yet sweet. Simply amazing.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app wakes me up every morning for school and its a really cool way waking up to a tablet! Wish it had more sounds to wake up to but you know it's free so you get what you pay for but great app!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm a big Michael Connelly fan, and this Harry Bosch adventure does not disappoint.  Harry spends twenty years attempting to find the killer of a young photographer murdered during the 1992 LA riots.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent series, you never know whats going to happen to the main characters. I can't wait for the next episode to be on.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|Adequate. When using film negatives it's a bit of an aggravation since the edge of the film catches on the device and you have to play with it a bit to have it seat properly.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game I have played mahjong for several years and enjoy this edition.  I would recommend this to any game player.
0792846443|5.0|&#34;Misery&#34; was an excellent movie and great movie to share with my grandsons.  Kept them on the edge of the couch for the whole evening.
B00683JK9K|1.0|Pieces don't rotate... If one of the primary functions of the game don't work, it's not able to be played. Tapping the piece makes it do a sort of vibrate... What gives dev??!
B005LAII3U|5.0|Purchased for Hubby for Christmas. Different from the original, but even better! I did miss the aliens....well, there is that one...lol. Lots of action!!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Seems like this movie cost about a billion dollars to make, complete with special effects that didn't even need to be included. Sometimes I didn't know what I was watching; other times I caught myself asking &#34;just why??&#34; quite a bit. This one is completely forgettable and unless you're an extreme Sci-Fi nut, just leave the house and spend the $ on a couple beers with friends.
B001W63DX2|4.0|This isn't a concert DVD as I thought. It's concert footage of full length songs in different cities. Well done, not cheesy, just don't be disappointed.<br />Bruce Dickinson taxiing and flying &#34;Ed Force One,&#34; their Boeing 757 is really cool, as he pilots the band city to city on the tour.
B008M34INW|5.0|Why not? There are a ton of bad movies out there now that you could waste your money on. This one provides solid entertainment value from the beginning to the end. Nothing mind blowing as far as the plot or cinematography; but for something that was barely even advertised at all I thought it was well worth the cheap rental.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite game. It was easy to download and fun to play. Haven't had any problems with it.
B005P5TQPU|4.0|All these episodes can be watched on their own & out of order if you choose. It's just good entertainment that always delivers. I'm happy that I still need to catch up on the last couple of seasons.
B001CTDH76|5.0|He was so pleased to receive this as a gift.  Nice to be able to find what he loves and at a great price.
1455853100|5.0|This audio book is truly amazing. I already have the hard copy so this is perfect to listen to as I walk the dog. Then I come home and check the book. It is such a clear and applicable resource I would recommend it to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. I play it everyday for about an hour. Its so much better than temple run. Please get this ga.e and play it!!!!! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loving this game so far.  Its kinds like temple run but instead of creepy monkeys chasing you,  you have a security guard.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Short and sweet. Tells the local weather or the weather where your going and its free. I like it, Your mileage may vary.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is so entertaining for me as an adult and for my four year old daughter n the 1old. an  its free.  i love it
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Fairly useless. Lets you read posts and reply. Use your laptop or notepad.. much better presentation. Ok for a quick look if your really into FB.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing... I became addicted the first time I played it. I love going through the missions, collecting coins, getting power ups and unlocking new characters and boards. I recommend this to every one. It is a lot of fun.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|It works. It doesn't rotate except in alarm mode.<br /><br />Ok for a freebee but speed a couple bucks if you want a real sleep, alarm relaxation app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so cool and better than the first temple run great graphics on the characters it's fun and the new features like the zip line are great and more fun this a MUST BUY GAME
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its free. It runs on Kindle Fire HD. What could be better.. well more angry bird for free would be better. Bring em on.
B007N5YY2K|5.0|Highly recommend this movie for the entire family.  Lot of funs.  The kids (9 and 7) really enjoyed it (as did the parents)!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Nice little app for managing your files on a Kindle. Good for side loading and shuffling your on board files around.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I play this all night and sleep very well. Helps me to drift off in just a few minutes. :)
B005FITIGO|5.0|I don't know how much creative license was taken as far as the true story but it is a great movie.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Isn't Rod Stewart always the best with his music? You f think of him as a 'rock star' but<br />this particular music is quieter and very relaxing.  Terrific style and relaxing music.
1608871452|5.0|I am a huge Supernatural fan so I found this a facinating review of the journey of Dean & Sam so far.
B009439HEY|5.0|I am a Genesis freak who owns 100+ CDs (studio albums and \\"imports,\\" so I am not a casual fan), and if you aren't familiar with the Hackett Era of Genesis, I doubt this will do much for you.  However, if you love Genesis, you are going to love this CD.  I have purchased many \\"tribute\\"-type CDs of Genesis music before, including orchestral interpretations and Hackett's first tribute, Watcher of the Skies (Genesis Revisited I).  I can say unequivocally that this is far and away the best of them.<br /><br />It is obvious that this was a labor of love for Hackett, who has faithfully reproduced the Genesis sound, to the point that some of the music is almost indistinguishable from the original.  And these aren't pieces of songs, these are the entire enchilada.  Every glorious note of \\"Supper's Ready,\\" \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight,\\"(with a piece of \\"Greensleeves\\" thrown in for fun) \\"The Musical Box,\\" etc. is here.  I was blown away by the sound quality, and the multiple musicians/singers Hackett has employed do a great job of interpreting the lyrics in their own way.  I must admit that many of the names weren't familiar to me, though there are the notable exceptions of Simon Collins (Phil's son) and Nik Kershaw.  One of those names I didn't know was Francis Dunnery, who has been blessed with a voice similar to Peter Gabriel's.  He takes the lead on parts of Supper's Ready and Dancing With the Moonlit Knight, and if you close your eyes . . . well, he's not exactly Peter, but I wouldn't object to him, Steve, Mike and Tony touring and playing the old stuff.<br /><br />This is a must-buy for any Genesis fan!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I got this long before Jennifer Lawrence was everywhere. It is now one of my favorite all time movies and she is amazing.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|Tremendous account of the closing days of the cowboy.  The movie depicts the struggles the cowboys faced as modern technology began replacing them. The grittiness of Lee Marvin always makes a great western figure, and yet here we see a glilmpse of his softer side.  All the casting was ell done.<br />I think this version is many times better than the more recent redo with Tom Selleck.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|For all of the stories I have seen on the new & TV about people who thought it was too good to be true when a gas company knocked on their door with a huge check so they could drill a harmless gas well, Well, this documentary takes you through the USA  talking to these folks and getting their story of the consquences. Not a pretty site.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This was a present. First reaction, &#34;I already saw all the movies and/or special features when I rented the movies.&#34;<br />Second reaction (this is for a film maker that loves special features btw), &#34;Wow, this has so much more special features than I thought. So much to watch. Plus I can watch movies (really Alien and Aliens is the only ones worth multiple watching) whenever I want. Love making of and commentary by Scott and Cameron. Cool!&#34;

B0037FFBCW|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant and the man that played Merrick is brilliant. A real tear-jerker.

0143119680|2.0|I was excited to come across this book and the many excellent reviews made me think it must be a sure winner.  However, after finishing the book, I felt cheated!  Normally, books that are part of a series make an attempt to tell a complete story in each volume so readers can enjoy one novel even if they aren't interested in reading the entire series.  This book was such a disappointment because the entire novel is simply setting the framework for the books to follow.  After nearly 600 pages, nothing is resolved and, in fact, the story seems finally ready to take off.<br />I have read other books in a series, enjoyed them and felt I had experienced a complete story whether I planned to read others in the series or not.  Be warned that this book pretty much only lays the groundwork for the next book in the series<br />without providing any satisfaction or resolution for the reader.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game.  It is very fun to play and has different people you can be.  It is a grand game.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I happened to come across this program on the Teleivision, and fell in love with the Castle Charactor. It has all the makings of an interesting story lines, humor, romance and fast pace, smart writing, and lovable characters. I bought all four seasons and watching the 5th season live.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Pretty good seems easier than the first one. I am enjoying it quite a bit right now. The graphics are much better in the second version.
B008NW67E0|5.0|husband loves this CD, loves all the Mumford albums; listens to them over and over again! Was a great purchase!
B005LAII80|5.0|Awesome, just..... Awesome! So awesome! So awesome my girlfriend liked it. So awesome the 3d rivals avatar. So awesome that the blu ray sales alone have made up for the poor box ffice sales. So awesome that it makes sly and rob schneider wish they had stayed away from this franchise.
B000KLS2LI|4.0|I was so happy to find this Special Edition of the Grease movie for my gf. it shipped very fast and packaged perfect. the little pink jacket is cool that goes around the dvd and it is also a great classic.
0062231375|4.0|Sardonic. Irreverent humor. Great style. Informative. This guy has a great gift. Articulate. Even eloquent at times. An excellent on camera presence as well. I am a fan.<br />Alex Cord
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor provides great insight to the mental and physical toughness exemplified by US SpecOps soldiers.  Lone Survivor further provides insight into the moral dilemmas and personal conflicts faced US soldiers operating under debilitating rules of engagement while constantly worrying about crucifixion by the liberal US media.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Raising awareness of the dangerously poor modern diet, excesses have become the norm and societal acceptance of toxic artificial foods is killing our population.
B005LAII80|3.0|I would give the movie 4.5 stars and the blu-ray 3 stars. First off, you get a single 2D/3D combo disc. Audio was good, but I expected more from the video quality considering it's a brand new movie. There are quite a few scenes with a significant amount of film grain in them. At least that's on the BD side, I haven't seen this movie in 3D. The shots only get really grainy in some of the darker scenes. Unfortunately, these darker scenes are mixed in throughout the entire movie. If you try to ignore it, it may only stick out like a sore thumb half a dozen times or so.<br />Viewed on Sharp 60\\" 1080P screen with PS3 for a player.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Most awesomest game in the world this game is so amazing I really want to be in the game I love this game so much
B0049J3RBC|5.0|I was impressed with the quality of the storytelling as well as the animation. I would strongly recommend it. well done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|First book I have read for pleasure in 5 years and it was amazing read it in 3 days.  Can't wait to read the next one!
B005LAJ212|4.0|I love this show it is my favorite tv show ever. I will be getting season two the next time I shop
B007G92QGO|4.0|I simply could not put this book down.  The characters were so true and believable -- their pain was absolutely palpable.  The plot moves along so quickly but does not sacrifice anything in terms of character development.  And, the question of what is more responsible or our character: nature or nurture is never really answered, but is left up to the reader to decide.  An absolutely fantastic read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was interesting to hear the opinion of a scientic mind rather than a religious theory.  In my opinion, a good read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|App is designed well with the user in mind.  So many versions available, and easy to move between versions.  Quick and easy to go from book to book, chapter to chapter.  Lots of extras--bookmarks, highlighting, notes.  Wonderful!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone Girl definately got better as I progressed through the book. The first third was a bit mundane but well worth sticking with theis novel. The ending leaves the question wide open
B004YM6JI2|5.0|hello,<br />  this was a fabulous 7th season.  after all of the different story changes from the beginning up to last season, this one seemed like a never ending storyline.  what can the brothers do this time?  there is definitely many eye openers in this season and left us wanting to watch the whole season 8, right now.  excellent show, cast, and funny gag reels.  can't wait for season 8...
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|There's only one real problem with this album.  The songs are so great that when you play one, it's so good that you want to play it again, and maybe a third or even a fourth time.  Staggering forward in this manner, it took me a week to get all the way to the end.  And I loved every minute of it.  I hoped for three-four great songs, at best, like you'd get on most albums, even with bands you love.  Finally Home way, way over delivers on that.  There's not a clinker in the batch, and some will surprise you:  I adored \\"A Thousand Wild Horses\\" and hope they may play it live at a gig soon.<br /><br />Thanks again, BSR--this one was more than worth the wait for it.  Keep it coming!
B0053O89IS|5.0|hello,<br />  being followers of the series, bones, since the beginning, we anticipated watching this season.  the season is an eye opener, with a rotating cast of characters in the lab.  but, after watching each episode, we closed the season feeling it was too short and we were wanting more.  we always get a kick at emily deschanel's portrayal of &#34;bones.&#34;  great cast, great series.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I knew someone that was in Danbury with the Author. It was amazing to be brought right into the life these women  had to live:/ I could NOT put it down!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Deep, existential musings in a gravelly rumble. What's not to love? (Except my wife says he puts her to sleep... ah, well.)
0812993357|4.0|It's a beautiful book! It really is a must for any full and part time fashionistas out there. The drawings and photographs alone make it worth your time.
0374532125|3.0|Moyo's thesis that aid in general has caused many of the problems we see in Africa today is a hot button topic. She supports her contentions quite well. I'm looking forward to applying some of this thinking in my own efforts to help out in countries such as Jamaica and Haiti.
1419703692|5.0|What can I say. Great book for a collector and huge fan of this awesome series. Need I say more?!
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Despite some undeserved controversy over Paul Simon's decision to go to South Africa and work with South Affrican musicians, Graceland was a revolutionary recording.  No one had combined African music and musicians with Western music in so seamless a fashion.  Seldom have words and music been so artfully combined with a hefty serving of wry observation and humor.<br /><br />This live CD consists of songs from Graceland along with songs from recordings that preceded and followed it.  Many of the musicians participated in the recording of Graceland and reunited for this concert.  The musicians' appreciation for Paul Simon and for each other shines through the performance.  The DVD is equally compelling as it tells the story of how Graceland came into being and what happened after its release.
