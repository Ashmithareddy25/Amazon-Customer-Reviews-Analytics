B002DMJLTE|1.0|Deep Impact is terrible in every way, a cinematic sharp stick to the eye.  I can forgive the lame special effects but the overall mawkish tone made me want to vomit. Truly awful.
0439023491|5.0|This book is a very strong sequel that backs up the first book very well.  It actually took a couple of long term turns that I did not see coming (usually if a book is about war, you can see where it is going, or about love you can also see).  There is a little bit of everything and it is not centered too much in the arena, or outside, but quite a good mix of both.  I absolutely recommend this book to those who enjoyed the first and if you haven't read either PLEASE do it; you will not regret it!
0316776963|1.0|Everybody is entitled to their own opinions...i just feel I was duped into reading this by all of the positive reviews I read on Amazon and all over the back page.  About 100 pages into this thing I couldn't go on anymore, it's just a waste of time.  I didn't understand that point of the book...it wasn't funny....wasn't interesting....no points....I can go on and on.      That being said, it is definitely down there but it is not the most-overrated \\"comedy\\" I have read, that would go to \\"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\\" by Alan Alda.  If you want to read a funny book go for J. Maarten Troost's \\"Getting Stoned With Savages\\" or \\"The Sex Lives of Cannibals\\"  but not his 3rd book.
0385504225|1.0|I hadn't especially liked Dan Brown's previous books, but I wanted to read this one so I'd know what the fuss was about. Turns out that I simply didn't have the stomach for it. After a bit under an hour i really just had to stop. The writing was bad, but the science was worse. Dan Brown takes the greatest hits of para-psychological research and...pretends the studies actually worked. Seriously, Wikipedia this stuff if nothing else; he's on crack. This is 9-11 Truther/Birther level WTF. Not the most promising basis for a novel. That the novel begins with \\"FACT: All rituals, science, artwork, and monuments in this novel are real\\" makes me wonder whether his editor was even awake.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|Watched this on PBS. Was so amazed at how current issues and story line intertwine, I just had to buy it to watch it again. Storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Always remember \\"Big Brother\\" is watching you and RFID chips that are now so common can be your worst nightmare! For those of you curious about the mark of the beast, as stated in the book of Revelation, this secular movie would be of great interested. For those of you just wanting a good murder mystery-excellent choice.
0765348276|5.0|The book is excellent.  It is extremely well written.  John Scalzi is definitely a very talented writer.    I gave it 5-stars so I definitely think it's a great story.  I wll not go into the details of the book; that's already been done in other reviews.    But I will talk about a few things that I did not like about it:  1.  Too much unnecessary sex.  When the recruits get their new bodies, they go at it with reckless abandon all over the place.  It's a rated R book.  I don't like it; I'm a bit of a prude.  2.  The main character, John Perry, remindes me of Bruce Willis from the \\"Diehard\\" movies.  He is has a great since of humor, is is an outstanding soldier with no weaknesses on the battlefield.  He is also the luckiest  soldier in the universe.  I mean extremely lucky.  Everything he does is legendary and medal worthy.  He is also the most well balanced soldier, mentally, socially, and emotionally, in the book.  He is extremely sarcastic and humorous and even self deprecating.  He does not know everything but his friends give him all the information that he needs.  Imagine Bruce Willis in the Diehard series.  Bruce is a regular NY cop who takes on international terrorists, says \\"Yippee-Kaya\\" all the time, and finds himself getting out of one tight spot after another through luck and un trained skills.  Bruce's character is also the guy who is grounded and in love with his wife and family.  And Bruce's sarcasm makes you laugh throughout the movie.  That is John Perry throughout this book.   The thing is, I don't like superheroes very much, and I could only handle the first Diehard movie.  After that, the act gets old and I refused to watch any other Diehard movies.  The same for this character, John Perry.  I could not read another book about this character.
0307455874|4.0|After reading Dreams from my Father I was hooked! When I finally got my hands on this book I was estatic. I knew that this wasn't to be an autobiography like the first one, nevertheless I expected President Obama to employ some of the same literary technique that I was exposed to in Dreams from my father that I grew to love.<br /><br />However, page one was a tad bit tedious to read, and so were pages two and three, and the whole entire first chapter. I laboured past it, and was deeply rewarded for this by the honest and straight forward prose I found in the chapters to come.<br /><br />Obama approaches each topic in the book by first identifying the issues, simplifying them and discussing them in relation to his personal experiences. He is quick to admit that he does not hold all the answers while laying bare possible solutions that sound so plausible you wonder why someone else hadn't thought to employ them before. He does this with light humour, introspection and personal touches which you will undoubtedly find endearing.<br /><br />I find this book to be a great way to get to know the great man that is the President of the United States of America, and his approach towards governance.<br /><br />It was a great read, and I am indeed looking forward to sinking my teeth into his third book.
B000MGATTE|1.0|Stephen King is one of my favs. I've been a fan for years.  I bought this on paperback when it was first released, I couldn't even finish it.  I thought I should give it another go after I purchased my Kindle but alas I still cannot finish it.  It's boring.  Lisey is boring and dull. Her inner thought narratives are just painful to get through. I cannot stand the way Stephen King tried to use the phrase \\"strapping it on\\". First of all it sounds gross (sorry that's just where my mind goes when I hear that phrase) and second of all he uses is way too much.  Lisey also uses the word \\"smucking\\" instead of the other word it sounds like. That's just stupid. I mean really. Most of the readers are adults and if the character was just too innocent to use the actual curse word then use \\"freaking\\" instead. I got further then I did the first time I tried to read it, about halfway through, but still couldn't finish it. What a disappointment.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|After several listens of both discs in full, I can say this is easily PT's best work since In Absentia. The variety here is immense with headbanging jams like \\"Bonnie the Cat\\" or \\"The Incident\\" to beautiful, melodic pieces such as \\"I Drive the Hearse\\" or \\"The Seance\\". There is no filler on the first disc. The only weakness I can see in the album would either be \\"Flicker\\" or \\"Black Dahlia\\", and even those songs are highly listenable and comparable to the tunes from Nil Recurring. \\"Bonnie the Cat\\" and \\"Remember Me Lover\\" are up there with Porcupine Tree's best material. Lyrically this album is back to classic PT, without the juvenile references found in FoaBP.      I will have to see how time affects this album. Right now I'm completely in love with it and it has already surpassed Deadwing and FoaBP for me. I think there is something on this album for any PT fan to appreciate, from those who prefer Stupid Dream or Signify to those fans to loved FoaBP.      Another thing I really appreciate about this album is the extensive use of the acoustic guitar. This is one aspect I felt very absent from the last several albums.       I'm not sure this album would win over any new fans that haven't cared for previous PT work. But for the fans, this album is all you could ask for.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is a great CD from beginning to end. The musicianship is incredible. Dave was always a great rythem guitar player but his leads are hitting that great level now also. Of course Chris Broderick is on another level and plays bristering fast, but with feel. Jame's bass playing is outstanding on this CD and Drover is the guy who really came into his own on this CD. He plays with power, timing and really drives the songs through. The production is outstanding as Andy did a fantastic job.  Best songs on the CD??? How the story ends, Bodies left behind, Bite the hand, Endgame, and 44 minutes really stand out. The right to go insane and today we fight are powerful songs also and very well done. This CD doesnt have a weak song and no filler songs at all and that is really impressive in this day and age.  How would I rate it along side Megadeth best... I would say third all time behind Rust in Piece and Peace Sells. It is just more consistantly good from top to bottom than anything else they have done and they have a great catalog to pull from!!! I highly recommend this CD if you like hard core, techinal, and great musicianship in your songs!
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Right off: The MAIN ATTRACTION for this movie is that it has \\"the stuff\\".  Whatever that intangible goodie is that makes a great  movie sit in the back of your mind so that when you wake up the next morning your first thought is about the movie you saw the night before... that is \\"the stuff\\".  Whatever it is that makes you point it out to a total stranger (who isn't even looking at movies) when you pass by it at the store... that is \\"the stuff\\".<br /><br />A short list of things that made this movie nifty:<br /><br />1. A phreaking cool antagonist with biological qualities that add to the already well done atmospheric properties of the movie... and it fit in fantasy AND sci-fi settings with equal ease.  Best beast in years.<br /><br />2. Well done atmosphere that makes the viewer pay attention to the bushes and shadowed corners while you watch the rest of the movie.<br /><br />3. A nice, mysterious progression of the back-story for the protagonist AND antagonist as well as the supporting fodder.<br /><br />4. A band of warriors that develop camaraderie as the story develops<br /><br />5. Viking fantasy soldiers in cool armour<br /><br />6. Sci-fi Space soldiers in cool armour<br /><br />Detractors were few and the first might actually be something that made the movie good:<br /><br /> 1. Caviezel  carried an impression of a beaten soul.  His character did have a back-story that lent itself to this type of behavior, but I never got the feeling that he totally recovered from it nor that he was fully triumphant in his conquests.  It gave the movie a bit of a \\"downer\\" tinge... or maybe it was a realistic nod toward the patriarch/provider/protector who keeps putting one foot in front of the other despite the soul-numbing hardships that are thrown in the way and who, through simple diligence anchored in duty and perseverance rooted in honor, manages to overcome and move on.  That didn't ruin it but it did keep it from being a \\"feel good stick it to the baddy\\" fantasy movie... which might actually be a good thing as some pretty horrific crap went down across the entire timeline and the way he portrayed his character forces the viewer to deal with that fact.<br /><br />2. Caviezel apparently can't hold or aim a firearm properly and looked like a goofball when he had one.  Good thing he had a sword for most of the movie (I can only assume he was holding that properly).<br /><br />3. There were several very minor inconsistencies that didn't ruin the movie but DID interrupt the flow and served to snap me out of the experience very briefly a few times while I struggled to suspend reality a bit too far.  These could have been handled by either more careful editing or some minor reshooting of scenes or additions to some scenes.  I'd imagine they didn't get done for the same reason this movie had a ghost presence on the primary market: MONEY.<br /><br />(2 and 3 just above are the reasons why this movie is not getting a full 5 Stars from me)<br /><br />Anyway, when I picked this movie up (after searching for it for 3 months after I saw its banner on a website) I was hoping for more sci-fi and less fantasy but they gave me enough to get me hooked and the story carried me through the fantasy portion.<br />All in all, a great, well developed movie that should have had more time in theaters and didn't get its fair share of advertising.  Go see it.  If you can't find it to rent it, it is worth buying (that is what I finally had to do).ent down across the entire timeline and the way he portrayed his character forces the viewer to deal with that fact.    2.

B002DMJLTE|5.0|I have recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of Deep Impact and i just have to say that the transfer to Blu-Ray is very very good. Great! The picture is crystal clear and the special effects are even better. I had the dvd and decided to purchase it on Blu-Ray because its one of my favorite movies of all time. If you have not bought this movie on Blu-Ray or have thoughts about it regardless its quality, BUY IT! you will not regret it! This is what you call a Great transfer to Blu-Ray.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Excellent concept here, virtually the entire film takes place at top speed, and afterwards you get the feeling you have been on the chase for 2 hours also. Reeves and Bullock are fine, but the sinister performance from Hopper is by far the most memorable. This was during the time he was filming those acid-trip NIKE commercials, and his character here fits that bill. He manages to shine despite being in relatively few of the scenes. Maybe it was those commercials or other films he made, but he was entirely believable and perfect in the part. It had excitement, had a solid plot, but most of all, had Dennis Hopper at his sinister best.
0439023483|5.0|I have read this book 3 times now and I still keep find new depth every single time. You will absolutey get lost in the drama and feel every twist and turn. The characters are so real and you want to follow each and every one of them. Hunger Games is my most favorite read to date.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|Many have written about this latest 16x9 being the incorrect aspect ratio because the material was shot for TV (4x3) and then the top and button chopped off to make a fake 16x9 widescreen version. While technically part of this is true, conceptually this is still a true 16x9 version based on how it was filmed. From the research I gathered from various reviews that actually communicated with the production of this series, the original filming was done using an open-matte concept with the intent of eventually creating a 16x9 presentation. My understanding of this approach is that a 4x3 ratio camera/film is used, but that basically the camera viewscreen has markings for a 16x9 aspect ratio. Thus, allowing the director to control what is captured and ensure all crtical content is within the 16x9 (widescreen frame).<br /><br />This is a very common practice these days and used by many populat director's (e.g., James Cameron, Terminator 3). One major reason for this approach is that it eliminates the hack-job method of making pan-scan full screen versions of films where important content is lost on the sides. Using this method the widescreen version contains all the content that the director intended by what is captured within the 16x9 framed viewscreen, while including the extra material above and below for fullscreen presentations with no loss on the sides and no need to pan around the image.<br /><br />So you see the production was geared to support both aspect ratio's as best as possible. While some may prefer the extra content above and below when watched in it's 4x3 format, it was considered superflous from the director's perspective. I'll bet many have actually seen widescreen movies filmed in an open-matte format and never realized or missed that there may have actually been more content in the fullscreen version.<br /><br />In the end, the original 4x3 release was intended to maximize the benefits of all the 4x3 TV's still out there. But as time has moved on andmore 16x9 sets are in people's home the newer 16x9 version should be the preferred version. Especially, if one considers that while some extra content is lost, what the director truely intended to be seen in the image is maximized on your widescreen set.<br /><br />Hopefully, this has cleared up some of the reasoning behind the change for potential future purchasers.
0743455967|5.0|This is one of the best, most straightforward books on writing fiction.<br /><br />The first hundred pages are a memoir of King's youth and early years of writing.  It's well done, from his banned high school writings to his love of the pulps and on through the story of Carrie.  It also includes a very candid look at his bout with drug and alcohol abuse.  If you're not interested, though, you can do as I did when I first got the book and skip those hundred pages, going straight to the section on writing.<br /><br />Here he introduces you to his \\"Toolbox,\\" which includes vocabulary, grammar, verbs, adverbs, and then into paragraphs and fragments, with plenty of examples. King demands you be serious about your craft, but he's never boring or pedantic or stuck in rules if they don't aid his aim.  He also makes good reference to everyone from Henry James and TS Eliot to John D. MacDonald and George V. Higgins, with plenty of respect paid to Strunk and White as well.<br /><br />The next section, \\"On Writing,\\" covers style, truth-telling, the importance of reading, writing schedules, writing rooms, plot, characters, what-if, description, setting, dialogue, theme, revising, pace, research, classes, and agents.  He also tosses in an overview of one writer's attempts to break in, and includes that author's query letters to agents.<br /><br />Finally comes a sixteen-page postscript on his accident and recovery, as well as thirteen pages on editing the first six pages of his story \\"1408,\\" complete with editing marks filling most of the pages.<br /><br />It's all very sharp and candid, telling you what you need to know.  Also, as someone whose work has been disdained, King has a healthy perspective on writing what you enjoy and to tell the truth or don't bother.<br /><br />Still, as good as it is (in my top three), I have two criticisms.<br /><br />The first is that I wish he'd made it into two books - one a memoir and the other on craft, to have given him more room to explore each.  For example, in one section he mentions \\"bells and whistles\\" like \\"onomatopoeia, incremental repetition, stream of consciousness, and interior dialogue\\" and says most books cover them, so he skips them.  I've never read anything on incremental repetition, and I'd enjoy King's views on the rest as well.<br /><br />The other aspect that could've been much improved is how after you've read it, and you want to read that section on plotting again, you can't find it.  The whole 108 pages on writing are one big chapter with numbered sections.  Why didn't they use \\"Plot\\" instead of just \\"5,\\" and \\"Description\\" instead of \\"6\\"?  There's no Index, either, so you have to underline topics as you go to be able to find them again.<br /><br />Still, the fact it's a book you go back to says more than any frustration with the layout.  King delivers on what you want to know, and he gives it straight from the hip, with a sincere, well-rounded overview of the craft.d whistles\\" like \\"onomatopoeia, incremental repetition, stream of consciousness, and interior dialogue\\" and says most books cover them, so he skips them.

B0029LXGXG|5.0|Mawxell's new album, \\"BLACKsummers'night\\" is the new album everyone has been waiting for. He has been away for eight long years. The last time Maxwell released an album was \\"Now\\" in 2001. In his off time, he worked on a trilogy, the first of which I've heard now. He produced his new album (under his alias, Muzse) with longtime collaborator Hod David. The album is a worthwhile- albeit short- listen. There are only nine songs, but all of them are fantastic. Although this is his album, the real star of \\"BLACKsummers'night\\" is former Mint Condition touring drummer Chris \\"Daddy\\" Dave, who plays on every song on the album, with his signature playing. Still in all, buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Purchased the set as a gift for my husbands birthday.  He lived in the Woodstock era and this was a really nice way to not only hear the music and see the era but the inclusion of the ticket, program and other items was a nostalgia trip.  Would reccommend to anyone who wants to experience the real Woodstock.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. This kept my complete attention.The acting is outstanding and filled with so much emotion. I saw it twice and finally bought it to add to my collection. Then I found out this is based on a true story. WOW! Will Smith and his real son were perfect for this film. They brought so much feeling into it.This will bring a lump in your throat. Comedy,inspiration, and drama is what this family movie is about.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Everyone knows the movie, it's good stuff. This Blueray was a good transfer, and I was satisfied. Great stuff!
B001FB4VXU|4.0|I am so glad to know that I am one of the many reasons why this show is one of the best sitcoms on television today. Being part of a test screen audience for the pilot I knew it was going to make a big splash when it officially hit the airwaves. Now it's one of the most watched and now even nominated for an Emmy award.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to watch any of this second season, so this was a must have purchase for me. The show pretty much picks up right where it leaves you in the first season with all it's nerdy glory. This time a few new things are thrown into the mix such as Penny getting into online gaming, Sheldon apparently picking up women and throwing the great Sara Gilbert into the main cast. Though I will admit while this second season is very much enjoyable I didn't get many belly laughs out of this season as I did the first. It was probably because the first season was an introduction to the routines and the jokes so of course when you see it for the first time you get a much more amped up reaction. Though I will say that the episode where Sheldon has coffee for the first time and pretends he's The Flash is classic!<br /><br />Still, I am by no means knocking the show because it is still enjoyable the acting is dead on and everybody should see it. I am just hoping that when season three comes along that my reaction to the show as a whole stays constant and doesn't dip.
031604461X|5.0|I'm not the kind of person, who jumps in and writes a review. But, after reading the previous 3 books and over 1600 pages how are you NOT going to read this book? I read the reviews and I hated that so many people felt the need to give so much of the book away (in details) before I could even read it.I almost decided not to read it, but I am glad I did. I have no idea about great journalism and the rules Ms. Meyers broke. But then again, I don't care. I just want to see Edward & Bella finally get together. As all the others it's an incredibly fast read and all my questions about tying all the plots come together.I enjoy that Ms. Meyers doesn't go into the gory details of things and that a young adult could read this book. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to continue the journey!    K.C.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Michael Jackson since the Jackson 5 and after his death I was looking for a CD collection that would cover all his music from the early years to the present.  I found it in the Ultimate Collection.  When I listen to his hits, I'll Be There, Rock with You, Billie Jean, Thriller, Black and White, etc I get goose bumps.  The best is the live concert in Budacrest!  Phenomenal!!!
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Dave Mustaine and co. has put together a Masterpiece of album. Simple as that. The soloing is insane from both of them. The choruses are as catchy as Youthansia or Cryptic Writings. The riffs are as heavy earlier Megadeth. All with a modern twist.     Begins with Dialectic Chaos which displays Mustaine's and Broderick's talent quite nicely, and its really cool.     This Day We Fight is such a fast thrashy song, amazing solos, and good vocals. Very intense song.    44 Minutes has this amazing epic intro, really deep and epic sounding. The song is really solid and has a nice chorus. Nice melodic solos too. Could've fit on Countdown To Extinction.     1320 is pure adrenaline, really catchy and very old school riffs. After the second chorus all hell breaks loose with the most amazing solo duel between Broderick and Mustaine. Best song so far. I am addicted to the album at this point.    Bite The Hand: really cool shaped very fun. Has this amazing riff that keeps popping up in between verses and choruses. Really thrashy good song. This song could've fit on Rust In peace perfectly.     Bodies is a 90's megadeth type song, with a really cool chorus. Also the ending is amazing with once again... amazing soloing. Very melodic and touching. The only song that  isn't masterpiece, but still really lovable.      The hardest part of letting go... is a good emotional song with some cool parts, but the lyrics confuse me as they counter his marital status.     Headcrusher is straightforward thrash, really cool second half of the song.    How The story Ends, is my favorite song the album, AMAZING CHORUS and cool triumphent sound. Awesome riffs and everything. One of my favorite Megadeth songs, period.    The Right To Go Insane, really cool song once again. It seems Megadeth discovered a new style with this song. Very unique and explosive ending.     Best album of any Thrash Metal band since the 80s. Just wish other bands could still produce good albums like this.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|Wow, no wonder they showed this episode for free. It was great, and shows a whole lot of potential. All of the characters are likable and the dialogue is very clever and witty. I can't wait for Doctor Ken's character to be introduced!
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|I'm not the first person to review this movie, and I'm certain I won't be the last. I WILL stand with many of the other reviewers who encourage a more \\"balanced\\" perspective of the film, and not the \\"berzerker-rage\\" perspective which some reviewers have offered.     ENERGY & ESSENCE:   My review of the movie can be summarized in the headline of this review. Hugh Jackman's fourth performance as Logan truly is \\"The Best There Is.\\" Whether it is because the movie's purpose is to focus solely on Logan, or because Hugh has evolved as an actor, or because Hugh has grown closer to the character. Jackman captures the full emotional bandwidth of the character. The pathos, the irony. the overwhelming sense of loss that comes with over 100 years of life on the planet. Part of Logan's appeal as a character has been that he is always seeking to become more than what he is. \\"Gifted\\" with \\"powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men,\\" he sees himself as an animal \\"less than human.\\" A Samurai without a master, who sees himself as a \\"failed samurai,\\" etc... The movie, and Jackman's naturally-enhanced physique and dramatic performance perfectly captures all of that ENERGY of the character.     Throughout the movie, Logan is surrounded by people who see either the \\"light\\" or the \\"dark\\" in him, and as such, the character is continually pulled in different directions, and tested, and as a result - grows. Whether it is the father who raised him - who sees the best in him, or later in life Kayla Silverfox, who acts as a guiding moral beacon to Logan, reminding him over and over that \\"he is not an animal.\\" They are (unfortunately) outnumbered by those who see the \\"dark\\" in him, including his mother, Victor and Stryker - the latter two who continually seek to exploit Logan's dark side to fulfill their own purposes. And Logan himself finds out that focusing too much on his dark side usually results in him paying a price of some sort.     PULSING & PUMPING THEMES:   Someone once saidthat a great musical score can elevate a move to \\"the next level.\\" Part of what DRIVES this \\"testosterone-filled\\" film is the music. It reaches its successful goal elegantly, and \\"dovetails\\" perfectly with the on-screen action, supporting it without overpowering it, or drawing disproportionate attention to itself. There is a solid foundation of pulsing rhythms that are tribal in nature. However, much like Logan himself, the music combines the base primal urges with aspirational tones. A mix of classical and contemporary instruments help give certain tracks a nice sharp \\"edge.\\"     Some characters have their own unique \\"themes\\" yet even these often have a \\"hook\\" of familiar notes/chords which remind us that these characters all reflect different facets of Logan himself. This often subtle \\"echo\\" also helps the entire soundtrack hold together as one cohesive entity.     All-in-all - Harry Gregson-Williams' score reflects the pure masculine energy of the character - both his \\"light\\" and \\"dark\\" sides as he grows against challenges - internal and external.   X-Men Origins: Wolverine     CONTRIVANCES - \\"Marvelwood\\" & \\"Hollywood\\":   I have seen the film in the theatre more than once. The first time I walked out of the theatre, I felt there were things that were very contrived.   Immediately after first seeing the film, I went to my \\"LCS\\" (local comic shop) to fill in some of the \\"gaps\\" in my knowledge of Logan's published history in the past twenty years. In anticipation of the film, Marvel Comics published a comic called \\"Wolverine: Weapon X Files\\" - which is an inexpensive \\"encyclopedia\\" listing the chronological history of Logan and his supporting cast.     The truth of the matter is that the published history of Logan has been \\"retconned\\" to be a LOT more contrived and convoluted than this film was (I mean, \\"Romulus\\" ? \\"The Lupine Sect\\" ? \\"Death\\" ? \\"Shogun\\" ? \\"Daken\\" ? \\"Elektra\\" ? and of course - \\"more,\\" come on...) The filmmakers (including Jackman) did a VERY fine jobof \\"stripping away\\" some of those cumbersome contrivances in order to more clearly communicate the pure ESSENCE of the character and his driving forces, as clearly defined years ago by Claremont, Byrne, Miller and Smith.   Wolverine   Weapon X (Wolverine)     If the film had slavishly followed the published history of the character for the past 20 years, as some reviewers had wished for, here's what would have happened:   - A small \\"comic-fan-boy\\" percentage of movie goers would have been orgasmically excited   - The larger percentage of movie goers would have been left scratching their heads   - All movie goers would have been spending too much time \\"in their head\\" and not in their \\"emotional heart,\\" leaving the same cerebral feeling that \\"Watchmen\\" did.   - A shorter run in theaters (it's on its eighth week as of this writing), and less revenue   - Shorter Run + Less Revenue = Less Demand for Additional Movies   - Most Importantly - the feeling, passion, conflict and ENERGY of Logan would have been lost.     - No, in reality, Victor is NOT Logan's brother, or even half-brother   (but, he's also not his father either. That was a red herring for years in the comics)   - No, Cyclops never met Logan before the X-Men   - No, Logan never met Gambit before the X-Men   - No, The Blob nor Deadpool were ever part of Team X   - No, Stryker was not associated with Weapon X (but then again, he was never a General either...)   - No, Logan's memory was not erased with a really-well-placed-bullet to the head     However - all of these \\"adjustments\\" are less contrived than some of the \\"retcons\\" in the comics these days, and are acceptable \\"prices to pay\\" since they made the FILM work better as a representational, cohesive whole, easier to follow for the majority of viewers, and fulfill it's Ultimate Purpose as a vehicle for the character of Logan / Wolverine.     IN (*SNIKT !*) SUMMARY:   \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" strongly succeeds in conveying the pure masculine energy of the character, and the overall essence of the character - his conflicted journey as he strives to become more than what he has been, and some of the key emotional relationships in his past. The filmmakers have wisely chosen to streamline 20+ years of needless published exposition & contrivances - in order to focus on the strong CORE of the character, which is what has \\"hooked\\" readers and moviegoers for the past 34 years     Logan / Wolverine is not the \\"deepest\\" or \\"most profound\\" character ever to grace the printed page, or the cinema screen. The essence of the character is pretty direct, but not simple or two-dimensional. But, in the words of the fictional character himself, he is \\"the best there is at what he does.\\" And more importantly, so is the Driving Force behind this film: Hugh Jackman.     WARNING: If you are a continuity-obsessed-fanboy, this film may cause anxiety, elevated blood-pressure, and in some cases hemorrhaging.     * NOTE: This is a review of the movie, as seen in theaters. As of this writing, the DVD has not yet been released. As such, I have no comments on the package design, DVD extras, etc...
0375842209|5.0|It's a beautifully written story, with thoughtful, memorable characters and images that will stay with me. One of the most touching is the image of Death cradling the souls of the dead as he carries them away. What a fresh perspective on a sad time in history. It's a story for both young and old that I look forward to reading again.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|A previous reviewer complains that you're afforded no \\"special\\" perks with this set. But, for what it's worth, buying the stereo box set will (currently) save you $12.35 on the cost of buying the remastered Beatles CDs individually.
B000000WA4|1.0|I cannot understand how such a weak album can be sold as a masterpiece! This sound could besatisfying for a teen-ager but a developed listener and music lover should save his money!
B000OCZBS0|5.0|These songs will stick in your head and never go away. It's the most bizarre mix of music I've ever heard, and it still works. Opera, swing, metal, mariachi... The songs are very catchy and are layered enough to be consistency interesting.     This is metal you can dance to AND head bang at the same time.       If you ever get the chance, see them live. The CD just doesn't capture the energy of their live shows, and this CD rocks. Plus the chaps are real nice as well.
B000003TA4|3.0|Nevermind is probably the best Nirvana's effort and it's the only I can suggest to neophytes. The problem is that only the 1st 4-5 songs are good (not masterpieces!). The sound is naif, spontaneous, but childish too...Anyway, much better than the absolutely unheardable \\"In utero\\" or the incredibly boring \\"Unplugged...\\".  If you want to hear the best \\"grunge-sound\\", let's play \\"Monster\\" by R.E.M. or TEN by Pearl Jam...
0735619670|5.0|Id write my own full length review but... I cant think of anything else to praise this book about that hasn't already been praised. Its a great book for both the novice and experienced programmer. If your serious about improving your software construction skills, this book is a MUST READ. It should be required reading for all programming degrees since it is pretty much language neutral. The lessons in this book will apply to pretty much any programming language out there at any time.
0060935464|2.0|I'll just sart off that I had to read this book for my Sophmore year, and to me, it just didn't fit. I can't say that I hated the book, for I didn't mind some equally impressive parts, such as the court scene, and bits and parts of the ending. But I'll just say overall it just bored me. People who like it don't get angry at me, just stating my opinion of the book. I'm not putting the book harshly down, nor burning it. Actually I've read a few parts over, but that doesn't mean I truely like the whole thing. But Harper Lee's pros were he excelent use of language, and discriptive words. I'll give her credibility for that, but to me, the book didn't cut my top 100 list.
B000TBI40I|5.0|I always looked at this as an lp, though some called it an EP. It would be the only EP that I know of that had 10 songs on it! Anyway, it's all good as the other reviewer said and there is no need in repeating what he said. I will say that just about all these songs are on \\"Past Masters\\" which has now become a double album with Past Masters I & II. This the 2 cd remastered set I'm talking about. I had to get it just for the songs on \\"Hey Jude\\" (though there are others I like). As for the lp, I'll have to get a copy of it as I loved the cover.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|A good one, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. About spies, the Middle East and terrorism. Excellent performances by everyone in the film; great direction too. And finally a script that doesn't let up.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|For years, Megadeth fans have always fought between Peace Sells and Rust In Peace as being Megadeth's best album. Now with Endgame, fans now have to argue among 3 albums. Endgame's guitars explode like howitzers just as ideal trash albums should. The shredding going on here physically makes you tired. The technical skill shown here is unmatched. Any metal fan should pick this this up without delay.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|....but I say that about all Bond movies.  I have nothing bad to say about this one.  If you like 007, you'll like this one too.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|I remember now why Logan's Run was so popular even though it has a petty week story. All the girls in the movie wear nice short little tunics and are braless. This was big in the 70's and the dawn of the \\"Burn the Bra movement\\" not to mention the gratuitous skin display. All in all a pretty poor movie that brought back memories of a happier time.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|What a pleasure it is to watch this opera performance from Glyndeborne. Firstly the Nicholas Haynter production is is a joy to behold; unfussy, well lit, fresh and sensible. Secondly the cast is admirable in its ensemble performance, vivid acting and satisfying singing. The only member of the cast that is well known is Miah Persson. She is the star of the show; she is beautiful to behold, acts superbly and is a terrific singer. What a package! The rest of the cast are all top notch, particularly the  Despina sung by Ainho Garmedia<br /><br />The orchestral playing (on period instrument) under the direction of Ivan Fisher is lively, sparkling and true to the spirit of Mozart. Added to this is the good sound and filming. All in all this version of Cosi van Tutti must take its place as the best version on DVD to date.
1400049628|5.0|this survival manual was very useful. it helped me and a handful of others survive till the military was able to fix the situation... in all seriousness this book was really good, its good for a laugh, if your a science fiction writer, design video games, or make science fiction movies. max brooks did an incredible job writing this as he thought of every detail possible, he even includes previous encounter history as well as what causes the initial infection, \\"ill let you find out what it is\\". if your in to zombie games, movies, or books this is a must have for your collection. for me it was worth every penny.
B0024F08RO|5.0|This is the last year of the TV series Prison Break and ties all the loose ends together in an interesting and satisfying way. Definitely worth having for fans of the series!
B000BCE7QU|5.0|This is one of the finest pop albums ever made, brought to up-to-date CD standards and with fantastic acoustic reinventions of eight of the tracks. I can't recommend it highly enough, but I must also suggest that smart shoppers may want to check it out on Amazon.co.uk, where as of this writing, it is listed at 6.68 pounds, or $11. Even with Royal Airmail shipping, the cost is in the neighborhood of $16--way cheaper than it's ever been offered on the U.S. Amazon. While you're there, you can shop around for other UK-centric music you might be interested in, like the deluxe reissues of ABC's Lexicon of Love, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions' Rattlesnakes and Manic Street Preachers' Everything Must Go, to name but a few. Plus the \\"new\\" Prefab album, Let's Change the World With Music, is also available at a better price. The more you get, the more you amortize the shipping cost. Regardless, it's worth it just to get the two-disc Steve McQueen all by its lonesome.
B000O599ZS|5.0|(Firstly, this is a review of the film, as opposed to the DVD or the blu-ray disc. For technical feedback, you may want to find something more specific. Just clearing that up. There are many reviews on this site and they're all different.)<br /><br />This is one of the greatest movies made. Obviously I'm not stating anything new or insightful by saying that. It's a known fact. Even if westerns are not your cup of tea, you must admit this is a powerful and well rendered piece of cinema.<br /><br />Hard to swallow that this movie garnered not one Academy Award nomination in 1956. Not for photography, score, acting? Was there a reason for this, I wonder. Possible. \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" wooed the Oscar people that year with an all-star cast and a grand and glamorous spectacle.<br /><br />Anyway, the places where \\"The Searchers\\" was shot are just breathtaking. That opening shot from the dark house to the wide open frontier has to be one of the best opening scenes in film ever. Ethan has come back to his brother Aaron's family after fighting in a war that ended three years earlier. He brings with him a quiet but seething hatred for indians (based on his demeanor towards his mixed breed nephew Martin).<br /><br />There's tension already but it soon gets even stronger. When Lucy lights the lamp for dinner and her mother quickly puts it out, Lucy instantly knows what is about to happen. And we get the general idea, too. Dramatic moments like this really make a movie crackle for me.<br /><br />\\"That'll be the day\\" seems like Ethan Edwards' slogan. Ethan is hard to figure. He is a hero and a villain in certain ways. He is smart and sensible but at times rash and tempermental. He is capable of anything, really. He seems to be a decent fellow at heart. He is a bunch of contradictions, and so are many people, so I think we can somehow relate to this man. Most of all he is determined. But is he going to rescue his niece Debbie... or murder her? It is a long journey, and it seems nothing will stop Ethan. I think his quest is not so much about finding a family member as it is about having a purpose that he thinks is right and true.<br /><br />Martin knows that Ethan is capable of anything; he is concerned that Ethan may do something bad (to Debbie), for she is now basically being raised as an indian. None of this is said but you can infer it easily.<br /><br />Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are good in their supporting roles. It's sad that they cannot be together because of the dire circumstances. How ironic that they should be reuinted accidentally on her wedding day to another man!<br /><br />The film keeps the viewer thoroughly engrossed because we want to know if Ethan will find the girl, or if Ethan will die at the hands of the Comanche. I have to say that John Wayne is very effective here: larger than life, likable, robust, sometimes funny, raw, and relentless.<br /><br />Funny how you recognize certain actors for their roles in other vehicles; a regular in many of John Wayne's movies, Hank Worden who played Mose Harper in \\"The Searchers\\" would go on to play the tall elderly room service clerk in the 1991 ABC-TV serial \\"Twin Peaks\\". His face is instantly recognizable. And  the character of guitar-playing Charlie McCorry is played by Ken Curtis, who would play the cranky and scruffy deputy Festus on \\"Gunsmoke\\".<br /><br />When I think of this film I instantly think of blue and orange; the sky and the earth. I always recall the gorgeous red sandstone rock formations of Monument Valley.<br /><br />The story has been compared to Homer's Odyssey; and Ethan changes over time and becomes nearly as ruthless and brutal as the \\"savages\\" he is bent on avenging. But does he track down Debbie? You'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Watching this movie, I just get completely involved with it and caught up in Ethan's journey. It's not just a physical journey, of course, but a journey of character and self discovery. In westerns, fightscenes and battle scenes tend to bore me, but character-driven stories really appeal to me. This one is all about the character. Ethan Edwards is as strong and memorable a character in cinema as any other: he belongs in the pantheon of greatest film characters... with Scarlett O'Hara (Gone With the Wind), Quint (Jaws), Marge Gunderson (Fargo), Atticus Finch (To Kill a Mockingbird) and Stanley Kowalski (A Streetcar Named Desire).This one is all about the character.

B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie is fantastic. My husband and I couldn't stop watching. Great story line and the acting is wonderful. A must see movie for any movie lover!
B000HF6ZR0|4.0|This is a good movie, with a very good cast. I have seen this movie many times and I still enjoy it.<br />It raises the question, \\"What would humanity do with the ultimate power?\\"<br />The power to make all their dreams come true!!! I think that's obvious!!<br />Watch the movie, and see what you think!!
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I've been obsessed with Muse since Origin of Symmetry and I'll have to say this cd worried me when I first heard Uprising before it's release.  First off, a little background for me. I play in an instrumental prog/experimental band and run a small recording studio. Other bands I adore are Porcupine Tree, Radiohead, Opeth, Pink Floyd, Dredg, and Sigur Ros to name a few...     With that said, Absolution is my favorite Muse hands down.  I was slightly bummed by the direction the last album took and was unsure of the future of Muse.  HAARP rid me of my fears there.     The Resistance (after many listens) is a huge step in a new direction that they were only pointing at with Black Holes and Revelations. The problem with this album is its song placement and short length for this wide array of styles.  If they wanted to really explore each of these areas and sounds, then I believe another 15 minutes or so divided between each style would help solidify this album and make it their cornerstone.    Uprising - This is a good track but no way to start off the cd. This song does not represent the rest of the album at all even if it is powerful and catchy with a great sing-along chorus    The Resistance - The first track that caught my ears on the cd, the title track is definitely a standout with an even balance of creativity and catchiness.  I relate this track to Map of the Problematique off their last cd, until the prechorus where it reverts into a style not heard since Absolution. Great bass work on this song.    Undisclosed Desires - the most underrated track on the cd.  As poppy as this track seems on the first listen, it is an incredibly gutsy track to add to the disk.. This really reminds me of something from Thom Yorke's Eraser cd, on steroids...with a more glammy Matt Bellamy flair to it. I actually realllly like this track when I don't think of it in the context of the rest of the album. If there were some sort of lead in/out tracks for this it would possibly make moresense and be more at home on the album.     United States of Eurasia - Love this track. It has all those Muse elements that everyone has loved throughout their career. There is the definite Queen influence here, but it was just as noticeable on Knights of Cydonia... Never-the-less its still an amazingly good and epic track. What other rock band uses Chopin? seriously people...    Guiding Light - Eh, it's ok. By no means a bad track, but nothing i'm going to write home about. It does its job.. fill the spot after United States of Eurasia when you are still thinking...what the hell just happened?!?    Unnatural Selection - New Born?? catchy tho.    I Belong to You - A strong look at their earlier work with a fun break in the intensity, the French is a nice addition as well. Fun track.    Exogenesis Symphony - THIS IS THE MUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR! as the Overture begins I feel that there is something amazing getting ready to happen.. and it does.. from Matt Bellamy's own excellent orchestrations to the chord progression to his falsetto melody over the top.. this track is incredible. The second and third pieces are perfectly done as well. This is the set of tracks that should've been the big centerpiece to this album to really wow fans. Instead it is tacked on the end like some last minute stroke of genius.    If I were setting up the track listing here to make this a successful disk, here's what we'd be looking at    United States of Eurasia  Resistance   Guiding Light  Exogenesis Symphony 1,2,3  Uprising  MK Ultra  I Belong to You  Unnatural Selection    but thats just me.... however, after several listens, certain parts of this album are my favorite things Muse has ever done, other tracks could have at least been better placed..   I am pleased with this addition to my Muse collection and will continue to support one of the best bands the world has seen in a very long time.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The best pop album ever, beautifully and lovely restored. The Beatles have never sounded better. The best 13 bucks I've spent in the last 20 years. BRAVO
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|My copy of the limited edition box set just came in this afternoon... and after having it on repeat for the past 3 hours, I can only describe the whole package in one word: beautiful. For anyone who also got the same thing, you'll know what I mean - the photography and artwork accompany the music perfectly. The music is already incredible enough, but having the visuals to go along with it enhances the experience so much more.    Listening through the album the first time round, I had to force myself to remember at times that this was the 10th studio LP to be released by a band that's been around for almost 22 years with a largely unchanged lineup, which by itself is a remarkable achievement; most bands these days don't even survive 4 albums, let alone ten. And that depth in consistency just may be exactly why Porcupine Tree always seem to grow from strength to strength from each album; just when you think they recorded an album that couldn't possibly be topped, Steven Wilson and co fire back with another masterpiece - and what a masterpiece this 10th effort is.    The biggest similarity between 'The Incident' and it's immediate predecessor, [[ASIN:B000O75F7C Fear of a Blank Planet]] is probably that both are concept albums. FoaBP placed a much bigger emphasis on lyrics than usual, and while a good record by all means, it had a pretty dark theme that left the listener emotionally exhausted by the time it ends. The Incident's approach is rather different and by Steven Wilson's admission, the focus this time is more on the music instead. Written by Wilson to be listened to from beginning to end as one long track, it's meant to be a musical journey one could never experience with your standard 3-minute pop song. The idea is even more poignant now that we're in an age where the 'jukebox' mentality is more prevalent than ever; I'm sure all of us know a good number of people who download albums just for their favorite singles and delete the rest of the songs without even bothering to give them a chance.    On paper, the concept of the album seems rather simple, almost like an an excuse for a lack of inspiration on SW's part, yet it's tastefully executed. The whole album is chained by a series of vignettes inspired by various 'Incidents', seemingly everyday accidents, crimes, or murders we see on the evening news that might be of no emotional value to us, but extremely destructive and traumatic for the persons or people involved in them. The Incident is Steve Wilson's attempt to put a more personal spin on things, writing most if not all of the lyrics from a first-person narrative, and even his own POV, such as in 'Time Flies', the centerpiece of the album as well as the most personal, nostalgic song he's written yet. The album also includes a 2nd CD consisting of 4 songs that have no relation to the main album's concept, but are probably surviving tracks that made it through the writing sessions that the band felt were too good to be discarded. Either way, it's a good idea so fans won't have to wait a few months before hearing it as an EP, as was what happened with [[ASIN:B0011BJQ52 Nil Recurring]] which to my understanding didn't get as much attention as FoaBP.    Musically, The Incident recalls nearly every ingredient that make up the Porcupine Tree broth; the dream-pop aesthetics of the 90s era [[ASIN:B000FVRRH8 Stupid Dream]] and [[ASIN:B0013URJTG Lightbulb Sun]] albums, the trippy psychedelic rock from the early days of [[ASIN:B0002CU4Y8 Sky Moves Sideways]] and [[ASIN:B00095MLGC Up the Downstair]], to the heavy riffs and wacky experimentation present in their 3 albums that followed after the turn of the millennium ([[ASIN:B00006IU73 In Absentia]], [[ASIN:B0007XT87G Deadwing]], and the aforementioned FoaBP). Yet every PT release manages to retain that Steven Wilson touch, and the way that the multitude of genres and styles manage to flow together from song to song in this record is just amazing. Long-time 'Tree fans will find this album a refreshing mix of old and new, yet for the uninitiated this album is a good way to start if you're feeling curious. In my opinion it's pretty much impossible to be a casual Porcupine Tree fan, because the average fickle listener from the street will never have the understanding nor the patience to listen to the album the way it's meant to be listened - from start to end on a loud hi-fi set at home along with the artwork and visuals (and preferably a nice hot drink), and if you have a surround sound system then all the power to you, I'm not that rich though!    Summing things up... even though the tracks can stand their own individually, The Incident is much, much more than the sum of its parts, and a magnificent achievement from a band that has always placed aesthetics and taste over mindless technicality, yet always maintaining that solid balance of musicianship and songwriting that made them stand out from their peers since the beginning. If you're already a fan of Porcupine Tree, you won't need this review since like me, you probably have been salivating over this album since February! If you're a new listener and on the lookout for ambitious, album-based music by a band that isn't afraid to progress and tear down the boundaries of genres as we know them, then don't look any further. Porcupine Tree belong to an inspiring and exceptional breed of bands still out there today that only get better with age.
B0013SJH7A|5.0|I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish Persuasion, a revelation in itself because the first time I picked up the book during my vacation in Jamaica, I barely comprehended it and couldn't get into it and ended up putting it down in exchange for one of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery.  I decide to start it from the very beginning, and after about five hours decided I would risk not being able to get up on time in the morning just to see how it all turns out.    Jane Austen's books, I've decided, is a little like watching a Shakesperean play (or any of the other British-made films like Snatch or Trainspotting, it takes a while to fall in with the rhythm of the language.  Your brain eventually trains itself to accept some of the archaic English as not being gobblelygook, and you find yourself falling into the plot and caring and even admiring the beautiful if somewhat stilted, language.    Now I have to admit that I have come into my admiration for Jane Austen late in life (about two weeks ago and I'm 41), and not for not having had exposure to her, either.  I do have a degree in English Literature, and Jane Austen is pretty much part of the standard reading requirement for any college or university.  I also seem to own all of the books, and I seem to recall doing a paper on Northanger Abbey, even though I couldn't tell you right now what that was all about.  This is, however, my first time reading Persuasion, if you don't count the time I tried to pick it up in Jamaica two weeks ago.    As an English major, I know that I was supose to revere Jane Austen, but I never understood why.  Earlier readings had left no indelible mark on my soul, but for some reason, this time around, I truly was enchanted.  With Persuasion, I believe a lot of it had to do with how Austen carefully shapes her characters.  These are true people to me, I fancy myself to be Ann, and her two sisters seem to me be just like my two sisters, without the power of the baronetand servants and estates and all that other good stuff that can only come with being a part of that genteel class.  Austen lets me live in a world so different from my own, so fascinating in its examination and yet filled with so much of the problems and realities that we would encounter in our everyday lives.      Persuasion is a study in human nature.  Some might argue that the characters lack depth, for they are either kind and good, like Ann, or selfish and shallow, like her sister Elizabeth.  I think though, the genius is in the presentation of such flawed characters - Austen is biting and unforgiving in her portrayals.  She is best when she is exposing some unjustness of  social mores or grossness of character.  But to be fair, even the good can make mistakes and be misled, and the good themselves are trying to determine what their proper place is in this unjust world.  It is their goodness which earns them their well-deserved happiness while the selfish and shallow (no one seems truly evil in this book), like in any good fairytale, get what they deserve.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Opening cut and lead-off single \\"Uprising\\" from English Alternative trio Muse's new CD \\"The Resistance\\" sounds like the theme to Dr Who or Twilight Zone set to a galloping beat. \\"They will not control us / we will be victorious\\" wails/warbles lead singer Matt Bellamy, sounding at times like Radiohead's Thom Yorke.<br /><br />And so opens Muse's 5th album, comprising 11 tracks and seeing them merging their Rock sound with a more Classical/Operatic flourish. The title track \\"Resistance\\" is more frenetic and atmospheric with snarling guitars and swirling synths in turn, while \\"Undisclosed desires\\" has an almost R&B approach despite the snarling Rock feel.<br /><br />\\"United States Of Eurasia (+ Collateral Damage)\\" starts off as a hymnal piano ballad before building to a Queen-style cinematic climax with an Oriental touch and skyscraping chorus before ending on a melancholic classical piano note. \\"Guiding light\\" is a beautiful anthemic ballad, while \\"Unnatural selection\\" is a brilliant mid-tepmo rocker with Bellamy sounding desperate and breathless.<br /><br />\\"MK Ultra\\" starts off blistering a blistering riff alternating with subdued verses, while \\"I Belong to You/Mon Caeur S'ouvre &agrave; ta Voix\\" is a thumping Rocker ending with a clarinet solo.<br /><br />Next comes the ambitious \\"Exogenesis symphony\\", comprising 3 parts; the serene \\"Overture\\" (filled with delicately plonking piano and majestic strings), the more classical sounding \\"Cross-pollination\\" with a Rockier second half (Quentin Tarentino surely missed this for his \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" soundtrack), and \\"Redemption\\" (with an absolutely beautiful piano solo at the end). Pretentious or a work of genius? I'll take the latter.<br /><br />With music this experimental and beautiful, resistance is futile!
B002C6K7N0|1.0|Endgame is an improvement over the three banal albums prior to this, but it's still not up to par with what the band was producing between 1986 and 1997.  There are endless riffs, solos, and drum crashes, yet none of them are particularly memorable or interesting.  This seems to be metal for the sake of metal.  There aren't any true classic songs on the album, and many tracks sound like they could have been written by any garage metal band out there.  The production is flat and artificial, with no space between the instruments and no dynamic range whatsoever, a terrible modern trend that's ruining music.  In addition, the vocals and some of the lyrics are the worst on any Megadeth album.  The main problem, however, is the lack of creativity and inspiration.  It makes you wonder why they even bothered.

0385341008|1.0|I am alone in finding this one of the most boring books?? What am I missing??
B002GZQYMK|3.0|Well, this is definately different from their other work. I think some of the songs were missing something but I just can't put my finger on it. Some of the songs are catchy. My favorite are the last 3 songs Exogenesis Symphony I,II, III. It shows their talent on a different level. I think the other songs could of used alittle more power. So, far Uprising and United States of Eurasia are my two favorites. Maybe the cd will grow on me. Still Absolution and Black Holes and Revelations are my favorites.

Frankly, I love the mystery and intrigue of a new secret society and set of symbols/clues but can't believe Dan Brown is getting away with selling us the same book over and over. I think I'll skip Langdon's next adventure.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|My comment is about the Kindle version sample. The is the second book in a row that I've read that has problems with the fonts/formatting. In the little bit of sample that we get, the book is riddled with little boxes with question marks in them where the reader can't figure out what to display.  Amazon, are you doing any QC on these books before you release them?
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This is not a review, but just a few words I'd like to add for any comments from anyone out there. I've known PT since 1998 and I think that their latest drummer, Gavin Harrison, has fit-in extremely well with the band. He really stands out when he drums and he gives me goose bumps when I watch him play. Don't get me wrong, they're all great musicians. But Steve Wilson, I think, is a very lucky man to have a drummer like Gavin on board. Gavin is a world-renowned, highly respected drum artist. Write his name in on YouTube and enjoy ALL his videos.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought Blokus on Amazon and sent it to the location of our family vacation this summer.  It was the hit of the week with everyone playing.  My 14 year old nieces, my 6 year old son, my mother in law (probably not a good idea to list her age).  Everyone enjoyed it tremendously.   It takes 30 seconds to understand how to play, but various strategies allow significant depth of play.    In short, it's a great game.
B002NXQ0X8|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I downloaded this, as I was not familiar with the music of Scarlett Johansson or Pete Yorn.  Well I am glad I downloaded it.  The songs are very catchy and the voices blend well together.  The harmonies are excellent.  Scarlett has an excellent voice.  The songs are 60s style pop, but with modern production so they don't sound dated at all.  Overall, this is a fun album to listen to.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|12/4/2009 Update:  The December 2009 issue of Sound & Vision magazine has an extensive coverage of Steve Wilson's work with Porcupine Tree on the Incident album, and also his work on the 5.1 mixes of three of King Crimson's albums recently released.  This articule confirms many of the great reviews that Steve's work is getting everywhere, and more specifically how he has become the \\"king of surround\\".  A must read!    -------------    There... I said it!    Porcupine Tree is in a class all by itself in the music industry.  And their formula is:  PT = MUSICAL GENIUS + TALENT + QUALITY + MUSICAL TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP    1.  Musical Genius:  Steve Wilson as the front man of the band just has unbound ideas that he translates into themes that are beautifully delivered in PT's music.  This concept album just puts together the ideas in a much more fluid way than previous albums.  The concept is developed with great beauty, grace and flow, and the multitude of musical styles have enough \\"space\\" to develop.   The first time I listened to \\"The Incident\\", it reminded me very much of the first time I listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon many years ago, it is an album that grows on you every time you listen to it.  The individual songs might not be the best that PT has created, but the sum of the parts is definitely greater and better than anything else they have done to date.  I do like some individual songs from Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet and In Absentia better than most of the individual tracks in The Incident, but the overall listening experience of The Incident is what will make this album a classic for many years to come.    2.  Talent:  The talent of the band is obvious, all instruments are masterfully played with such precision.  The guitar playing is exceptional, and the drumming impeccable (Gavin Harrison might be the best drummer alive).    3.  Quality:  Everything PT does exhudes quality, from the production to the instruments, to the recording, the album artwork, lyrics, sound quality and of course the unmatched 5.1 surround mixes.  Nobody in the world comes even close to Steve Wilson's skills in the 5.1 surround arena.  He might have learned a trick or two from the master Elliot Scheiner, but now Steve has developed an edge over him, in part because Steve creates and plays the music as well, he's not just a sound engineer!    4.  Musical Technology Leadership:   As mentioned above, Steve Wilson and PT have developed the best sounding records over the last few years.  The 5.1 mixes are just amazing!   I got the limited edition version of The Incident, that contains a DVD Video with a DTS 5.1 mix.   I have fully enjoyed listening to it over the last few days, and I can't wait until PT (hopefully) releases the Advanced Resolution DVD-A later on.   I own both the DVD-V DTS and the DVD-A versions of Deadwing, and it is very clear that DVD-A is superior in sound quality.  However, I could not wait this time around for the DVD-A to be available, so I invested in the limited edition package, which in itself has been a superb investment (the books that come in the limited edition are amazing!)  When \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was created, Alan Parsons (sound engineer) and Pink Floyd did not have access to what today's technology has to offer, but Parsons did an amazing job, well ahead of its years in recording that album.   Steve Wilson and PT do take advantage of the technological advances in recording and surround technology, even though most artists today don't care or invest the time to make their work available in high quality, surround releases.    In summary, this album should go down in history as one of the best ever.  However, we live in much different times than when \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was released.  The music industry has changed a lot, people don't really \\"listen\\" to music anymore and the pseudo-music that sells millions of copies is usually assembled and produced in a couple of weeks and marketed to thelowest common denominator.  We are just lucky that there are true artists like Steve Wilson and PT that have preserved the ability to create music that is intelligent, well crafted, and fully enjoyable, while exploring topics in human nature in the lyrics in songs in a way that nobody else can do it!
B002GZQYMK|2.0|Having thought that Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry, and Absolution were entirely flawless albums, I was saddened to find that The Resistance's foundation was composed of what I did not like about Black Holes and Revelations. The album is mostly flat, and it fails to build songs to successful climaxes as the previous albums did. I was truly disappointed.    I would advise that anyone considering buying this album listen to it beforehand, to ensure that they do not later regret the purchase.
0143036556|3.0|Jared Diamond doesn't know how to write a dull book.  With respect to messy books, however, he's coming up fast on the inside track.     \\"Collapse\\" is the relatively thin sequel to \\"Guns, germs and steel,\\" the popular classic that studied why societies flourish.  Despite its subtitle, Collapse concerns mainly why societies decline.  Diamond posits that the most important causes are environmental and social, and he seeks evidence in 10 case studies ranging from Easter Island to Montana.                      The value of \\"Collapse\\" to you depends on what you want.  If you seek facts that entertain, then step right up.  Diamond's case studies tell us little that is new, but they convey that little with flair.  Of Rapa Nui, Diamond writes that the nearly 400 stone statues, ranging in height to 70 feet and in weight to 270 tons, had been \\"thrown down, many of them toppled so as to break them deliberately at the neck\\" (page 80).  If you prefer facts that inform, then you need only to go to Diamond's sparkling bibliographical essay.  But if you want theory -- what is social collapse?  Why does it happen?  -- then you had better retreat to Tainter and Toynbee.  Diamond says he has a conceptual framework, but he must have left it in the garage.     Diamond wrote the book to \\"[employ] the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute\\" (page 18).  We cannot dissect a society in a lab, so we must regard its history as a natural experiment.     Fine.  Ideally, the analysis should examine several histories that hold constant all potential determinants of collapse save the one of interest.  Here's a crude example.  If we wish to know why empires fall apart, then we may compare Rome's histories as a republic, an early empire, and a late empire.  Some potential causes of social collapse happen to be constant over this period for Rome - its penchant for military imperialism, perhaps.  Since they are constant, they cannot explain changes over time in Rome's prospects for survival.  This leaves us free to focus on some potential cause of collapse that does vary over time.  If we are interested in Rome's incentives to citizens to behave themselves (rather than stab Gluttonus Maximus in the back), then we can look at how the weakening of such incentives over time might have left Rome more (or less) vulnerable to invaders.  Did bread and circuses strengthen the loyalty of residents to Rome?  Or did they attract malcontents who took a view only towards their own stomachs?              Such questions are hard enough to answer.  We need not add to the mix other societies that fell victim to other causes.  The inclusion of Easter Island, which was probably doomed by exhaustion of natural resources, merely confuses matters.  Even given our evidence of incentives to waste island resources, we would have trouble isolating their contribution to social instability.  If natural resources and incentives change over time, then disentangling their effects on Rapa Nui's survival (without the aid of careful theory) may prove impossible, particularly since they probably were related.  To relate these entangled effects to the fall of Rome as well would be an exercise in glibness.                       Even with global factors under our thumb, we still must control local factors.  An example is bread supply in Rome.  The emperors could not always feed hungry rural migrants.  Bread riots destabilize, but this need not arise from the emperor's reluctance to feed the poor.  A bad harvest may be at fault.             My point - that we can analyze only a simple model of the world and not the world itself - is familiar.  Were I feeling more Berkeleian this morning, I could argue that the world might be just a mental construct, anyway.  For now, I add merely that abstraction does not imply imprecision. Having chosen the factors of interest, we can express them numerically and probably should.  To say that Roman breadriots \\"rarely\\" occurred is quantitative in nature, anyway.  \\"Rarely\\" refers to a numerical interval that we shall hide from the reader.  Is a bread riot every year rare?  What about every month?  Rather than tell the reader that the riot is rare, and pray that she trusts us, we might as well provide the rate of incidence and let her judge for herself.  The writer can relegate calculations to footnotes if he has the religious conviction that readers hate numbers.           We should simplify and quantify.  And that's enough, I think.  Comparative history can only satisfy given constraints.     But Diamond doesn't satisfice.  His methodology is to eschew systematic thinking.  He says he will evaluate his 10 studied societies according to five causes of collapse:  \\"Environmental damage, climate change, loss of friendly contacts [with neighboring societies], rise of hostile contacts [with other societies], and the political, economic, social and cultural setting...\\" (page 21).              What principle underlies these five causes?  None, evidently.  They comprise a shopping list.  How did he compile the list?  Diamond does not answer this clearly, but he may have drawn upon the very case studies that he will use to \\"test\\" his list (page 420).  In that case, his sample is biased from the get-go, and his study has no useful statistical results to impart.  (These observations are moot since Diamond doesn't extract statistics from his case studies, anyway.) Even if he has resisted the temptation to test his hypothesis first and articulate it later, his theory is still scattershot.  Why pick these five determinants and not another five?               Shopping lists are not unknown in science, and Diamond might have salvaged some information by categorizing the societies according to the causes of collapse that they seemed to share.  But Diamond doesn't do this, either - although he had co-authored such a study, with Barry Rolett, about the Pacific islands.  His failure tostate conclusions does not stem from a lack of opportunity: One chapter discusses Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share an island and thus may enable an analyst to hold geographical factors constant.  Diamond fumbles by failing to specify the relative importance of non-geographical factors.   (A similar natural experiment might compare East Berlin to West Berlin in the Soviet era.  Diamond doesn't try this one.)     Given that he wants to identify causes of social collapse, Diamond's research tactics are strange.  Presumably he wants to characterize a statistical population of all possible societies, not all of which have come into existence yet nor ever will.  This population is indefinitely large. A random sample of 10 societies is probably too small to indicate what the population looks like.             Worse is that Diamond doesn't pick his sample randomly.  He deliberately selects societies so that no two illustrate the same points that he has already decided must be correct.  He picks Easter Island for being \\"as close as we can get to a `pure' ecological collapse.\\"  Pitcairn and Henderson islands illustrate \\"loss of support from neighboring friendly societies\\"; Norse Greenland, all five determinants.  Of course, \\"no book on societal collapses would be complete without an account...of the Maya, the most advanced Native American society and the quintessential romantic mystery of cities covered by jungle\\" (pages 20-21 for all quotes).  As a work of science, this book is a terrific travelogue.  In any event, the book does not comprise a sample of size 10 of a population - but instead 10 samples of size 1, each of a separate population.  Statistically, the book is worthless.                 Why does the author of \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" suddenly turn intellectually timid?  The reasons are murky.  He criticizes one-cause theories without spelling out what is wrong with them.  Why group decision-making sometimes fails is \\"obviously a complex subject to which there would not be a single answer fitting all situations\\" (pages 420-421; also see pages 326-328).  We can't have a one-cause theory of group decision-making, because we obviously can't.  Generally, we can't have a theory because we can't have a theory.  Any fool should see this.  Come to think of it, Diamond is not that timid.              Diamond misunderstands the goal of theory.  To understand is to newly categorize the objects of interest, be they societies or baseball teams.  To set up a category, we must stress some attributes of the objects and ignore others.  For instance, in the economic model of perfect competition, the vital trait of a farm (say) is that it is too small, relative to the corn market, to affect the price of corn.  The model ignores the farmer's educational background as irrelevant to the amount of corn that he can sell, since this is wholly determined by the market.  Diamond shouldn't reject environmental determinism as a theory of social collapse just because it's simple (pages 438-439).  Market competition is a simple theory, too; that's why it has flourished for two centuries.  Were a theory not simple, it would not help us understand.            Diamond hoists himself on his own petard.  One cause is insufficient for a satisfactory theory, but five causes will do.  Why is five the magic number?           Diamond may even misunderstand how, for producing some outcome, a cause may be necessary and yet not sufficient.  He writes:  \\"To those who would object that there is not a necessary link between Malthusian population pressure and genocide, I would answer, `Of course!'  Countries can be over-populated without descending into genocide....Conversely, genocide can arise for ultimate reasons other than overpopulation...\\" (page 327).  I presume that Diamond means to say that overpopulation is not sufficient for producing genocide; overcrowded areas don't always erupt in murder.  But overpopulation may still be necessary to genocide in the sense that under-populated areas never resort to mass murder.  At least, Diamond has not provided evidence (or logic) to the contrary.  He does cite, as a counter-example, the Seventies genocide in Cambodia \\"with only one-sixth of Rwanda's population density\\" (page 327).  But even given that Rwanda's population was too dense, we cannot conclude that Cambodia's was OK because it was only a sixth as dense.  Such fine-tuning requires a theory of population density.  We already know what Diamond thinks of theories.              Sometimes Diamond criticizes theory sensibly.  It is silly indeed to suppose that societies must be like individuals, passing through a cradle-to-grave cycle, since they are collections of individuals.  But he does not seem to recognize that all good theory is metaphor.  By simplifying and organizing, theory enables comprehension.  Diamond eschews simple theory and sticks stubbornly to what he thinks he knows to be true:  \\"...Different societies collapsed to different degrees and in somewhat different ways, while many societies didn't collapse at all\\" (page 7).  Of what value is this vapidity?  It's better to be clearly wrong than vaguely right.                   Diamond's hostility toward abstraction creates muddle after muddle.  The full title of his book would be \\"Societal collapse involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses\\" (page 15).  Thank God that we were spared the title, if not the book.              One brief passage in the book speaks volumes.  Diamond disparages this newspaper remark:  \\"Rwandas [read: genocides] are endemic, built-in, even, to the world we inhabit.\\"  He observes: \\"...That fatalistic oversimplified conclusion provokes negative reactions...for three reasons.  First, any `explanation' of why a genocide happened can be misconstrued as `excusing' it...\\" (page 326).  So, we should avoid simple explanations?  Heavens, we wouldn't want to make anybody mad at us.             To his credit, Diamond quickly adds that we must understand tragedies to prevent their recurrence.  Then what was the point of criticizing the journalist for simplicity?  Well, it is \\"simplistic\\" to blame the Rwanda genocide on overpopulation.  \\"Other factors did contribute.\\"  These include past ethnic domination, past mass murders, and stagnant economies that force poor men to join violent groups intent on political power.  Doesn't population pressure play a role in these factors?  Diamond's determination to enumerate all forces that he sees blinds him to obvious connections among them.            Most important, Diamond's creeping atheorism leads him to misapprehend the theory that might shed the most light on what his case studies mean - Malthusian overpopulation.  The first (1798) edition of Malthus' \\"Essay on population,\\" which Diamond cites, takes only a few hours to read.  But Diamond gives what is effectively the Cliff's Notes version:  Exponential growth of the human population will eventually outstrip the slower, linear growth of food production, forcing a crisis that will decimate humanity - until it starts growing again, ripening for another crisis (\\"Collapse,\\" pages 312-313).             That answer will do fine for our Civics midterm, but a book might require a little cogitation.  Malthus thought that the growth rate of the population depended mainly on human passion.  Since none of us can control our lust, the probability of pregnancy is determined by biological factors that don't change perceptibly over time.  So, the growth rate of the population is a constant.  Thus the amount of growth is exponential:  As the population increases, the addition to it increases at an accelerating rate.            However, the amount of food produced depends only on the number of acres farmed, Malthus argues.  Implicitly, he holds constant the amount of labor and capital available per acre.Assuming that all acres have the same fertility, newly farming a fixed number of acres each year will add a fixed amount to the annual harvest.  The food supply thus rises in linear fashion over time.            In short, we add an increasing number of babies each year but have only a fixed amount of new food to feed them.  At some point, we won't have enough new food to fill all the new mouths.  People will starve.  Those who don't will fall prey to the concomitants of famine -- disease and war.  To fit this Malthusian theory to Diamond's book, just add a modern covariate - deadly pollution.  That's all that the Club of Rome ever did.          Identifying the holes in Malthus' theory is a favorite undergraduate exercise.  The most obvious weakness is in presuming that the number of acres sown is the only determinant of food supply that can vary over time.  In particular, a growing population increases the demand for food, which pushes up farm prices and profits.  Yet Malthus' farmer doesn't respond by innovating ways to increase his yield per acre -- the use of fertilizer or machines, the conversion of a fallow acre to grazing, or the creation of hybrid crops that grow rapidly and resist insects.  The late Norman Borlaug received his Nobel Peace Prize in vain.  Malthus' fatal error was assuming that self-interest would affect sexual decisions but not economic ones.            Oddly, Malthus does recognize that demographics affect technological change.  A clergyman, he writes that the long-run tendency of the human population toward misery is God's way of compelling us to invent.  The prospect of starving concentrates your mind wonderfully.            Even had Diamond read Malthus, it is not evident that he would have understood the weaknesses in the clergyman's argument, because Diamond knows less about economics than a good college freshman.  \\"Technology\\" refers to our knowledge of how to produce, and it is neither pro-environment nor anti-environment.  In one ofthe most confused sections of a confused book, Diamond argues that technology must lead to environmental degradation, because technology is defined (by Diamond) as physical capital that leads to environmental degradation.           \\"New technologies, whether or not they succeed in solving the problem that they were designed to solve, regularly create unanticipated new problems.  Technological solutions to environmental problems are routinely far more expensive than preventive measures to avoid creating the problem in the first place....All of our current problems are unintended negative consequences of our existing technology.  The rapid advances in technology during the 20th century have been creating difficult new problems faster than they have been solving old problems: That's why we're in the situation in which we now find ourselves.  What makes you think that, as of January 1, 2006, for the first time in human history, technology will miraculously stop causing new unanticipated problems while it just solves the problems that it previously produced?\\" (page 505)           We are privileged to have among us a scholar versed in every day of human history.  But there's more to Jared Diamond than this.  \\"Most of all, advances in technology just increase our ability to do things, which may be either for the better or for the worse\\" (page 505).  A naïve fool like me might have thought that increasing our abilities would expand our opportunities to battle famine and war and leave us free to reject new opportunities for violence -- but no.  We are compelled always to abuse our knowledge, since technology always creates problems faster than it solves them.  That must be why life expectancies have been rising for two centuries.  There are things that man is not meant to know, so let's just forget everything that we've learned.  Then we'll be home free, albeit a trifle damp in the home cave.                                          Penguin Books has leveled with us aboutthe editorial care that it lavished (ahem) on \\"Collapse.\\"  The best-read page in any book (save those sold in Washington, D.C., where the name index takes priority) is the bionote that precedes the title page.  Here, Penguin describes Diamond as the son of a \\"teacher/musician/linguist mother.\\"  Why not characterize her as a \\"teacher, musician and linguist\\"?  Did she periodically morph in a Druidic rite?             Although trivial in itself, the failure to correct a clunky phrase suggests that none of Diamond's transcontinental editors - one in New York, two in London - paid him the courtesy of a critical reading.  As a result, Chapter 16 - which presents Diamond's impulsive responses to alleged \\"one-line objections\\" to environmental protection - is a barrel full of catfish.  It fails to provide even the reader holding the wrong end of a blunderbuss with a halfway interesting target.            \\"Guns, germs and steel\\" improved the tone of the environmental debate; \\"Collapse\\" dumbs it down.  I can't wait for Diamond's next book.

B001FB4W0M|5.0|The best show on tv continues to deliver!  I am not going to rehash the synopsis of the show; I'm just going to tell you that it is completely worth your time, money and effort to buy and watch Supernatural!!  This was my first blu-ray ever, and I thought it looked great.  I did find the menus to be slightly clunky and that stupid ad for blu-ray at the beginning was annoying, but that wasn't enough to take the rating down a star.  I do want to say that the dvd version of season 4 is very nice, so if cost and format are a factor for you, I don't think you will regret buying the dvds instead.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|I thought this was a very good sequel. I had to re-watch the other two, because I haven't seen them in 3 years. I thought this had a really good storyline, great comedy, and a good message. Manny and Ellie are expecting a child, and Manny wants them to be safe. Diego thinks he's losing his predatory nature, and Sid is jealous of Manny and finds three eggs in a cave. It turns out that they are dinosaur eggs. Soon, the mother comes looking for her babies, and ends up taking Sid back to her 'dinosaur world' Manny, Diego, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie decide to go save him. They run into a crazy weasel named Buck, who decides to help them. Every now and then, Scrat turns up, looking for his nut, and Scratte is always one step closer than he is. I highly recommend ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS!!!
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Listening to Get Lucky it seemed to me that the word for the moment was \\"mellifluous\\".<br /><br />So I looked it up cause I wasn't really sure what it means.<br /><br />Definition: Pleasant to hear.<br /><br />Synonyms: smooth, honeyed.<br /><br />Yup. That says it all about this laid back CD.<br /><br />Those looking for lots of hot licks (which Mark can obviously lay down with the best of them) may be disappointed.  But there's another kind of virtuosity that's about melding it all together in a way so seamless it becomes, well, mellifluous. And that's what Get Lucky has in spades...<br /><br />Knopfler's voice, which sometimes seemed quirky in the Dire Straits days, is now an essential ingredient of what sets him apart. And his lyrics give you something to think about...<br /><br />He's made it all that much more accessible with liner notes that invite you in to an understanding that otherwise might be missed.

B001QOGYFO|4.0|This movie was better than I had expected. At times it seems like an action film, then switches to suspense, and then it goes to a type of slasher film! Everybody does an awesome job, especially the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who stars as a U.S. deputy marshal named Carrie Stetko who is assigned to solve a murder in Antarctica within three days before the antarctic winter begins. I loved all the beautiful scenery that took place at night, and the big snowstorm. Carrie and her crew soon find a Russian plane that has been hidden in the snow for 50 years, which holds something worth killing for. Carrie must deal with more than one killer and she is betrayed by one of her friends. I highly recommend WHITEOUT!!!

B0026J8LHM|5.0|DT have been on my shortlist of CD's to keep in my car since the beginning of time (Images).  This album has since replaced Images as my most played.  Every song is good, but Count is my pick for best.  Nightmare is also up there, lyrically and musically.  Simple lyrics = better in this case.  Phasing the song to follow these events is brilliant and really hits an emotion for anyone who can identify with the situation.  The risk they took laying it out there for their fans has payed off in spades.  Even non DT fans who have heard this album in my car are intrigued and ask questions \\"who is this band\\" or \\"this is really good\\".  Of course, when you get tired of the singing go pick up a deluxe version with all songs in instrumental.  Only listen to this after you know the songs and it becomes a situation where you are singing the songs in your head.  Brilliant!  DT has not let me down.
0439023483|2.0|I bought this book because of reading the reviews and recommendations. I love all books and am an avid reader of adult, paranormal, YA, etc. The story was creative and kept you on the edge...BUT I did not like the writting style. At all. It is written in first person(which I do not have a problem with) but it's different than most first person veiws. So instead of I packed my bag and starting walking toward the tree, it is; I pack my bag and walk towards the tree. The sentences were fragmented and confusing at times which had me reading them several times. Also I found a hard time trying to picture the world that the author creates.     Maybe I am being to picky, but I couldn't overlook the writting style even though it is a creative story.
0810993139|3.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a 2007 children's illustrated novel by Jeff Kinney, and the first in the eponymous series. Greg Heffley, an awkward seventh grader, struggles to adapt to middle school and life in general. The book is presented as his journal.<br /><br />Kinney's illustrations, which appear on just about every page, are what make the book work. The characters are barely more than stick figures, but each is distinctly distinguishable from the rest. The pictures flesh out the book to a necessary degree, and contain much of the book's humor.<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid is never particularly funny, although it's just about always amusing enough to keep the pages turning. The book's appeal to kids and adults comes primarily from its easy relatability. Just about everyone has experienced some of the awkward family, school and adolescent moments that Greg has.<br /><br />Much has been made of how Diary of a Wimpy Kid is \\"realistic fiction.\\" And at its most realistic, the book is quite enjoyable. Yet Kinney often stretches beyond what could conceivably called realism in repeated attempts to make scenes funnier. This typically has the opposite effect - events are obviously contrived, the reader can no longer relate, and in these moments, the book falls flat (although this probably won't bother kids much). In any event, the book is such a fast, disposable read that its flaws don't matter a whole lot.<br /><br />On the whole, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is mildly amusing for both kids and adults, and it's something most anyone can relate to, at least a little bit.
0060254920|5.0|Great book- it inspired me to write a parody book at [...]. My girls loved Where The Wild Things Are when they were young and that was about 30 years ago. Check out this for your little ones[[ASIN:1423801199 Where The Wild Things Are 2010 Wall Calendar]]. I still enjoy the book and its connection to the empowerment of the spirit of the very young 2-4 years old.
B0000019PA|5.0|I just listened to this cd for the first time this morning.  I don't know why I have never heard of this band before.  I found it by looking at the recomended items from amazon and I now want to buy another of their albums.  I am sure not everyone will like this.  I can't even really describe what kind of music it is.  But the sound clips give you a good idea.  I like this kind of sometimes somber sounding music, and I love the saw and trumpets.

B0019CSXAM|5.0|How I met your Mother:Season Three is another funny and entertaining experience in this epec story. I love how the prospect of meeting the woman in question is flashed in front of you at every moment but is she ever reveiled you might ask? Well between you and me there is a moment in this season where I think they may bump into each other for a split second but that may just be my over active imagination playing tricks on me but if you really want to fine out you need to get this season. Though if you have not seen the previous two seasons you must. If you have seen the previous seasons all you need to know is Robin Sparkles has another appearence as well as the slap bet rears it ugly but funny head again. A must have DVD
B001TH16DI|5.0|I don't understand why people give this set such low ratings. I have not watch the original set produced back in the days, but after watching the blu-ray set i became a fan all over again! the quality of all these movies gave me the feeling that they were made recently. I really enjoy the set so i really can't understand why others rated in such way, unless they got a different set.  So if you like Star Trek i really recommend this set to you
B001KNMAS6|1.0|Lame. These are bootleg CDs which were lovingly created by a skilled individual (or maybe a group who knows) and freely traded among fans. Charging $90 is totally a rip off. If this doesn't get pulled before you profit from it, at least may a thousand camels spit in your general direction.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie considering all the bad reviews. How can anyone complain about it being too dark or grim? It's post nuclear war, helloooo it's not meant to be a happy, family type of film. Very good sci-fi flick, cant wait for the blu ray in Dec
B000002W9Q|5.0|This has not been my best summer--for one thing, a lot of people passed away. I certainly had a lot of respect and admiration for Patrick Swayze. He had worlds of talent as evidenced by his fine performances in motion pictures--and his singing on this album. This CD soundtrack to one of Patrick's movies, Dirty Dancing, has terrific music that gets my foot tapping to the beat of these tunes every time I play this album! There is a good diversity of artists and the quality of the sound is excellent. I also like the artwork.<br /><br />The album begins with Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes performing \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life;\\" they do this with panache and I'm very impressed. They sing together very well and this opening number is easy on the ear and memorable to say the least. The music makes good use of the percussion and strings, too. Great! The Ronettes follow with one of their best tunes ever, \\"Be My Baby.\\" \\"Be My Baby\\" is quite passionate; and The Ronettes' excellent diction and timing makes their performance very strong. The percussion is excellent and overall this music lacks nothing--The Ronettes' \\"Be My Baby\\" is all THAT good. In addition, Patrick Swayze and Wendy Fraser do a great job on \\"She's Like the Wind.\\" \\"She's Like the Wind\\" hit the airwaves big when it was originally released and that's grand; it brings back good memories for me.<br /><br />\\"Hungry Eyes\\" was a hit for Eric Carmen; he delivers this faultlessly and I love it. Maurice Williams and The Zodiacs do justice to \\"Stay;\\" they do this one without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! The Blow Monkeys do a stunning job on \\"You Don't Own Me\\" which I first heard sung by Leslie Gore; and there's another gem in Bruce Channel's \\"Hey Baby.\\" \\"Hey Baby\\" has a musical arrangement that fits perfectly with Bruce's vocals and I particularly like that harmonica.<br /><br />Mickey & Sylvia do a classic hit entitled \\"Love Is Strange;\\" they sound great together and it has a certain romantic flavor to it that I just plain like. The CD also ends strong with \\"(I'll Remember) In the Still of the Night\\" performed by The Five Satins. The Five Satins made it all seem so easy--but of course we know that it really wasn't all that easy. Their talent carried them through.<br /><br />Overall, the CD soundtrack to the movie Dirty Dancing is loaded with incredible music; I mentioned most of the tracks but there's really not a dud in the bunch here. I highly recommend this for people who enjoy romantic music both old and (relatively) new. Of course, fans of the movie itself would do well to add this to their collections.<br /><br />R.I.P.

B000KKPN5C|3.0|I own the SB-400 and SB-600 and used them frequently for my D80 for 3 years now. Both have performed very well and have not failed. Using rechargeable AA batteries saves me a lot of money. The CONS that I do not like about the SB400 are:<br />- It displays a shadow when using a longer lens. I purchased a Tonika 12-24mm lens with my D80 and I have to tilt the flash upwards in order to eliminate the shadow that it creates from the barrel when using a direct flash. Using the SB600 or better eliminates this issue.<br />- When using indoors such as your living room, it may not provide the best illumination. It can only cover smaller space or closer range and you will have to adjust your camera settings to get a better lighting.<br />Buy this flash if money and weight are an issue. It works well if you are using a prime lens such as the Nikon 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, or 50mm; My recommendation is to get the SB600 instead for better range and illumination. Get the SB800 or 900 for better flash photography or if you intend to use multiple flashes as a remote flash commander when taking creative photography indoors. You will be much happier if you get any of the full flash from Nikon.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Porcupine Tree continues to amaze me with each release as not only do they continue to evolve with each album... but each album contains some of the most diverse and captivating music. Yes alot of it does take a few listens, but that doesn't mean that its not captivating upon first listen.<br /><br />There is a requirement for this album in my humble opinion. And that is for it to be listened to straight through from start to finish... The album flows as one big piece of fantastic music. We hear Large powerful and heavy chords striking through the center of our brain (Occams razor, Blindhouse, Octane Twist) Beautiful acoustics (Kneel and disconnect, Your Unpleasant Family, Time Flies, I drive the hearse) Funky heavier tool/meshuggah  like riffs (The incident, Octane twisted, Seance, Circle of Manias) ANd even some of the atmopshere/ambience we've seen on some of the earlier albums in shorter tracks like the Yellow windows of the evening Train, and Degree Zero of Liberty.<br /><br />ANd yet each of these songs are not Restricted to the feel that i mentioned. They all Move and feel their way around the range of genres that Steven Wilson so seamlessly Blends into a melting pot of gorgeous sensation.<br /><br />The Production is fantastic as ever, and all the members of the band contribute greatly. Gavin's drumming is less noticeable yet still shines, especially on tracks like Octane Twisted and circle of Manias.<br /><br />My personal Standout tracks are<br />2. The Blind House<br />6. The incident<br />9. Time Flies (Sensational)<br />11. Octane twisted<br />14. I drive the Hearse<br /><br />Even though the tracks i mentioned are mainly the longer tracks, the shorter tracks blend in perfectly and add fantastic dynamics to the overall sound and experience of the album. Do NOT hesitate to check out this masterpiece. Steven Wilson is truly under rated and so are his band mates of Porcupine Tree.  5 Stars
B002GZQYMK|3.0|This album sure wasn't anything like the previous two. I was really looking forward to more song like those instead this album sounded more like their earlier stuff. I like Uprising a lot. But it sounded like the only inspired song on the album.
B001GCUO16|5.0|This is one of the best action movies from the X-Men series. Great action sequence with a superb story line.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others,\\" a German film laden with well-deserved accolades and awards, captures the lonely despair that was urban communism in the 1980s.  Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has created a minor masterpiece with this work - it stands next to the novel \\"Gorky Park\\" as an elegant indictment of the worst evil of the Communist Eastern Bloc - their societies depended upon turning their citizens against each other.      \\"The Lives of Others\\" closely examines the toll such a society takes on both the watched and the watchers.  An accomplished policeman has dedicated himself to the State.  Ruthless and efficient, he is the guy who breaks the unbreakable, learns the unlearnable.  He is a man of exacting dedication to principle.  But to master his craft, he has denied himself virtually all of life's pleasures.  His life is empty except when he is at work.      And then one day he is charged with investigating a charming writer - a favored son of East Germany.  After bugging the man's flat (shared by the writer's charming wife), the policeman sits in to listen.  This he does for weeks, and he comes to admire this all-too-human couple.      Why is he, this most principled of men, investigating them?  For a thoroughly unprincipled reason, of course:  because a corrupt government official has the hots for the wife and wants to trump up a charge against the husband to get him out of the way.    \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a slow-moving film, but it draws you in as it builds to a shattering climax and a surprisingly humanistic note as two people who should never have shared anything quietly share the most special of bonds.  This is a Darn Good Film.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|Just imagine if you were back in 1963, and you held this album (assuming you could). Everything about these guys was different. They were British. They had long hair (for 1963). And they wrote 8 songs themselves; heck, Elvis or Bobby Vinton never wrote songs. And the music was a revelation. Every instrument was clear; they violated Phil Specter's thick \\"wall of sound.\\" Paul's bass playing was completely new; it was electric, not an upright bass. But best of all was the singing. Every guy could sing; who else let their drummer sing a song? With this asset, they used their voices in radical, unconventional ways, practically for every song; even at this early point, Beatles' harmony was unlike anybody else's. They even threw in a special echo effect (on \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\") I don't even like some of these songs (\\"Misery\\" and \\"Anna\\"), but this record remains historic.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|I have to compliment Dave and the gang for a well done release here.<br />For what it is, it is done very well.<br /><br />BUT .....<br /><br />I guess I am getting older.<br />This double bass drum, thrash power chord, fast scale run solo wanking does not excite me like it did when I was 20 years younger.<br /><br />Yes, when I was 27 I loved this stuff...... now at 47 I find myself preferring more harmonic textures and layers and melodic riffs.<br />Heck I am enjoying some 1940's Big Band and Classical that I never listened to before in my life !!<br /><br />But I realize that is me changing....... so in evaluating the new CD I have to listen to it thru my younger ears and rate it from that perspective.<br /><br />Yes, it is well done and deserves a good rating. So I am giving it 4 stars.<br />The only reason I don't go with 5 stars is many of the songs are too similar in tempo, key and structure so that they blend together in your mind as kind of being all the same.<br /><br />No, I will never listen to it again and in fact already gave it away to a friend's son who it just getting into heavy rock music.

Oh, wait that's been the storyline for every season except season one.  I still love show and the five year jump was a brave move......I just didn't love this season.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|As the other reviews tell you, Dr Horrible is well, fabulous. even if you can get it free on the net it's totally worth buying, not least for the commentary and the excellent musical commentary, which is almost completely done in (all new) songs. This has immediately gone to my top 5 drawer! If you like Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, Joss Whedon, Felicia Day, funny stuff, singing stuff, sweetly amusing or some cheese then you will love it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing the Shred for a couple of weeks now and it is a great workout without a huge time investment. It works out every muscle group in only 20 minutes and gives you cardio with strength and really builds endurance.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|After reading a ton of reviews and agonizing over which way to go regarding mono vs. stereo, I bought the Beatles Mono box set.  I'm glad I did.  After listening to the Mono albums on my iPod, home stereo system, and in the car, I'm very pleased that I made the right choice for someone who first experienced the Beatles phenomenon in HS and then grew with them musically and culturally through 1970.  I hated the old stereo mixes that split the vocals and instruments, but I worried whether the Mono mixes would have the energy and familiar mixes I remember.  Here's why I believe Mono is best...    The Beatles music was never intended to be heard on audiophile systems or with headsets.  It was instead popular music meant to be heard by teenagers listening to the radio.  The original excitement about the Beatles was a result of their fresh approach, the energy in their music, and the quality of their songs and performances as we heard them on the radio or on LP's played on inexpensive portable stereos.  Beatles music just leaped from the speakers and into our heads.  So to me, the real test of success for the new CD remasters is how well they capture the original listening excitement I remember so well.  The 1987 CD's somehow lacked excitement, and I found that I wasn't listening to the Beatles as much.  (Of course, there was also a lot of newer music like Springsteen, etc. to occupy my ears.)  But I got excited about the Beatles music again when I bought the Capitol remaster box sets (which are wonderful for we Americans who grew up with them).    I can now happily testify that the initial excitement of the Beatles is back once again with the EMI Mono remasters!  They sound great, and the packaging and presentation is also excellent.  Although I appreciate the detailed technical reviews of the experts who have dissected the EMI remasters, I would recommend that anybody considering buying the Beatles catalogue (for the fourth time in my case) think about how you will listen to them.  Most of us won't hear the technical differences due to the ambient noise of our listening environments (car, outdoors), the inherent sonic limitations of the player (e.g. iPod earphones), or the simple fact that we original fans have lost hearing sensitivity (particularly high range) due to our age.  (Arrrggghhh, how did that happen?)    So if your real test is regaining the excitement of the Beatles music, I would recommend going with the Mono versions.  And I also recommend getting the Capitol box sets with the extra reverb and order of songs to complement the EMI versions.  I now have separate playlists on my iPod for the EMI early albums, the EMI later albums, and the Capitol albums.  And I'm enjoying the Beatles all over again...

0316017922|3.0|What was it Shakespeare said? \\"The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in the stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings.\\" Or words similar.  In Gladwell's book, it seems that he believes that the \\"stars\\" do make the difference in our successes.  We can be as smart as all get out, but unless the stars are aligned right: i.e. you were born on a certain date, something new comes on the scene just when you are ready to embrace it, having put in the hours of study and practice to be ready when that right place and right time comes along; your culture does not hold you back (women especially recognize this fact), and someone behind you gave you a shove, metaphorically speaking. Conversely, of course, then the opposite is true.  So the main lesson I'd take from this book is to prepare yourself and your children the very best you can by study and practice, especially in childhood, and do a lot of networking just in case there is someone out there who can give you a boost. If your culture teaches you to be subservient, and the user of \\"mitigated speech\\" (a downplaying or sugar coating of the meaning of your words)then seek a teacher of behavior modification and hope to heck something important comes along in your field.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|I'm glad I watched this dvd set again before I wrote my review, because I was all set to give it 1 or 2 stars. It's not as bad as I thought it was watching it on tv. The problems are many: Clark needs to grow up and step up to his fate. Clark needs to FLY. (To hell with that no flights no tights rule!) Clark needs to do less wrestling with his ethics and more wrestling with the bad guys. Basically the series needs less angst-y drama and more action. Just to be clear, the actors are doing a fine job, it's the plots I have a problem with.<br />The biggest let-down for me was in the final episode. They spent ALL SEASON building up Doomsday, and when they finally let him and Clark fight, their fight only lasted ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY FOUR ****-ING SECONDS. And all Clark did was stuff him down a big shaft in the ground. Now Clark is abandoning his humanity. Again. And Zod is back. Again. --Sigh...<br />In the plus column, I really like that Lois and Clark are starting to warm up to each other.. I have always liked Erica Durance in this role, I think she's perfect for it. She has so much attitude, just like Lois Lane should. I'm glad they've moved on from Lana, (at least, it seems like they have) because we all know she's not \\"the one\\" for Clark, so let her go. I am interested to see how that goes.<br />So basically I think the show needs to have less drama and more action. Clark is about 22 by now, right? Kara could fly at 19? I think it's time to get him up in the air. Let Clark and Lois slowly but surely draw closer together, Give Clark some interesting opponents, and above all, next time this show spends an entire FRIGGIN season building up a super villian, their big smackdown had BETTER last longer than 1:34.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Buy this, listen to it all the way through (many times) and enjoy the genius that is Steven Wilson and Porcupine Tree!  This release is an absolutely moving journey through spirited anthems, moody minefields, haunting yet sometimes disturbed beauty, and straight-ahead drill-you-in-the-gut power.      The great thing about PT is they take the time and care to skillfully balance the musical and lyrical ingredients and--poof!-- out comes an album that creates yet another fascinating vista within their impressive musical landscape.  Of course the musicianship is spot-on, yet fits perfectly into the whole--this is no menacing show of chops, but they're definitely there without being overstated.      No need to evaluate this masterpiece track by track.  Suffice to say that if you appreciate wonderfully crafted, impeccably produced modern rock and roll (call it \\"prog\\" if you want, it doesn't matter), then you should get this release and sequester yourself for a few days to enjoy every delicious morsel.  You won't be disappointed.
B0010ZR160|2.0|I remember my intrigue at Casey Affleck's character in Good Will Hunting how efficiently he played the part of the younger brother and his face registering with me.  I knew I would see him again if for no other reason then that his brother, Ben and his buddy, Matt were making it big.  Since then he has worked his way up the chart with parts of increasing weight. Now we are graced with the double debut of brother Ben's directing in a salable feature and Casey as lead in Gone Baby Gone.      I've had the good fortune to read several LeHane novels.  Except for a few recent books, Mystic River among them, LeHane's stories involved an unlikely pair of investigators that have a long, sordid history in Boston.  I missed Gone Baby Gone and for the sake of seeing the film version and this review I am glad I have not yet read it.      The film opens with Casey as Patrick Kenzie tooling through the streets of Boston, a cinematic tool that worked well in the development of the characters in Good Will Hunting but does nothing to establish the Kenzie character or a sense of the City of Boston.  Instead the editor and director choose to idle on Casey Affleck's face and the simmering background of an aging Boston excessively and for no useful purpose.      LeHane's Kenzie/Gennaro series tells the story of Kenzie and his female partner Angela Gennaro, private detectives with a wide range of acquaintances from police detectives to the most heinous of Boston's underbelly.  This is what puts them in the position they so often find themselves; doing the work that police could never get away with and solving the crime.  This is an important point that fails to ever get established in the film.  Both viewers who have read LeHane and those who have not are left asking several nagging questions; Who are Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro?  Why do people hire them?       It is with this unexplained history that Kenzie and his platonic live-in partner, Gennaro waltz into the offices of cops,Remy Bressant and Nick Poole and lay down some ultimatums about mutual cooperation after the pair reluctantly agree to investigate the kidnapping of a neglected four year old daughter of lowlife drug addict mother.  For the next hour Kenzie happens upon clues in the case and the cops essentially do nothing.  Then comes the first ending, the part where Kenzie's voice over emotionally prepares the audience for the end by telling the \\"beginning of the end\\" story of Gennaro's break up with him.  Another failing in the choices made by the director leaves us feeling nothing here because we never learned that there was relationship between the two.  In the novels, Gennaro plays many characters to Kenzie, in this case she could have been eliminated and nothing would have been lost.      The movie doesn't develop the character of Remy Bressant, deftly played by Ed Harris, a cop with an apparent debt owed to the aging Police Capt. Jack Doyle, played by Morgan Freeman.  Without the Bressant character there would be no story.  The talents of both Harris and Freeman are wasted in this film.         Instead of developing any of the characters, scenes like when brother, Lionel McCready, confesses the life cycle of three shots of Cutty and a tall boy are used.  These types of poor editing choices waste precious minutes of film time.  Ben, as co-writer of the adaptation, is also responsible for dialog that is so bad in places it distracts from the movie experience. The scene between Kenzie and Gennaro talking philosophy was beyond believable.  Right then and there, I imagined Ben and Casey quibbling over the conversation in real life. That was a distraction.  Kenzie's apparent devout religiosity and moral code is not set up properly and the audience is left with trying to believe that an afterthought rather than a crucial element is the basis for the emotional and moral decision that is the climax of the story.  Where a more adept director could have left me crying at the end of this movie I skipped out of the theatre without a shadow on my heart.  I am not beyond giving Casey another chance to succeed in a starring role but I would advise him not to do it with brother, Ben.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|The new album delivers a mix of what we've come to expect from MUSE (fantastically well crafted if bombastic alt rock) and bravely pushes forward at the same time (classical arrangements, funky hooks).  Lyrically all the classic MUSE themes are here (government control gone very wrong), but in the midst of it all there is a sense of optimism formed from the idea that love conquers all.  After three listens I've decided this one's a keeper.  Despite all the radio play of Resistance & United States of Eurasia, I think the best track on the album is MK Ultra and Guiding Light is the weakest.

When I got into my car I tossed my new book in the back seat and popped Buble in the CD player and drove around till I had heard it at least twice. Some of my favorite traveling music.<br />A new voice that give new life to some old standards. What a find!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I love this product it came quickly and in perfect condition, and not to mention you cant beat the price!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Everything that is advertised in the adverts for this set (featuring prominently in the Blu Ray Star Trek Movie collection) is absolutely true.<br /><br />Painstaking effort was put into the digital mastering and restoration of the series, as evidenced in one of the documentaries on the first or second disc, which actually shows what I've never seen before: exactly HOW footage is \\"digitally mastered\\" or restored.  They show them doing such disgustingly brutal and time-consuming things such as rubbing out and scrubbing scratches, dirt, dust, and other imperfections from film footage.  They also show how all the music was re-recorded EXACTLY as it had been in the original show.<br /><br />For a low-budget TV series in the 1960s, the picture quality is stunning.  It never falls below DVD quality, though true Blu Ray perfection is elusive, as many shots suffer from some minor scratching that escaped notice, or blurry or scratchy bits that could not be fine-tuned any further.  There are still hundreds of shots and moments that are in perfect Blu Ray detail, and perfect colors and contrast.  You can see perfectly now that, keeping true to his green blood, Spock's skin almost always has a greenish tint.<br /><br />One of the great things about it that always appeases people like me is that you can choose BOTH the original episode or the Remastered versions, separated only by the option once starting an episode, or switching with the previously completely useless \\"Angle\\" button.<br /><br />The show itself utterly astounds and blows me away by just how mature and ahead of its time it is in storytelling and morality.  Almost no episode has a clear cut \\"black and white\\" context, and there are very infrequently any real villains who are evil simply because script demands it to be so.<br /><br />Some of the highlight episodes include \\"Where No Man has Gone Before\\", the second pilot episode, which features Gary Lockwood (Frank Poole in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\") playing Gary Mitchell, a navigator on the Enterprise who suddenly gains godlike powers and silver-covered eyes after the ship attempts to blow through an Electromagnetic barrier at the edge of the galaxy.<br /><br />Rather than explaining anything, it's a complete mystery just what has happened to Gary.  We are told and explained how it involves ESP and his psychic response to it, but we never KNOW if his mind was permanently changed, or if an energy creature took control of his mind, or if he was genuinely becoming corrupted.  There are scenes where he is struck with extreme energy, causing his silver eyes to disappear, and he looks to Kirk with his normal eyes and calls out weakly \\"Jim...\\", only a moment later to have his silver eyes return, and his attitude returning to the haughty \\"A God am I\\" sort, leaving Captain Kirk AND us wondering whether Gary could truly be saved, or if it was a trick.<br /><br />A great many episodes follow this format of morality, and conflicts between what is right and what is logical, and even between two different versions of right.  One of the most jarring and mind-blowing episodes for me involved the Enterprise attempting to establish diplomatic relations with a peaceful planet, only to discover they've been at war with their neighboring planet for 500 years... and have fought the war entirely on computer (like video games), and when people die in the computer, they report to suicide booths in real life, in order for the war to progress.  No one likes it, but they accept it, because if they do not, they break a treaty, and invite REAL war that could destroy both planets.<br /><br />And then the episode with Khan, \\"Space Seed\\".  What I found truly wonderful about the end is how Kirk understands that Khan is not truly evil; he is simply himself.  He knows nothing else but to dominate others, and lead them.  So rather than imprison Khan for the chaos he caused on the ship, he 'exiles' him and his crew to Ceti Alpha V to form his own little Kingdom, andtest his strength and intelligence in surviving the harsh conditions of that world.  Khan joyfully accepts the challenge, though \\"Wrath of Khan\\" shows us just what became of that 'exile'.<br /><br />All the discs except one have bonus documentaries on them, with the only questionable one I think being an ego-service one focused entirely on William Shatner, who spends the entire documentary talking about his love of horses and horseriding.<br /><br />The only flaw with the set involves the sound.  The sound quality is superb, but the sound effects and music are INSANELY loud compared to the softness of the dialogue.  It is a serious unbalance between the two that causes a constant need to be at the helm of the remote control's volume level.<br /><br />Aside from that, the set is huge with the episodes, original version or remastered version, extra features, select episode commentaries, and documentaries on a wide variety of subjects, including interviews with Gary Lockwood, Ricardo Montalban, the entire original cast, and Billy Blackburn, who not only was an extra in many episodes, but provides home video footage from the set of some episodes.e harsh conditions of that world.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Finally it arrived yesterday! My long awaited Beatles Stereo Box Set! I started collecting the original CDs when I was 12, and finally finished my collection when I was 18 or 19. I put these discs up for sale on EBay just to purchase this new remastered collection. It does not disappoint! The box is very sturdy, and a great protective housing for all of the digipacks. The packaging looks absolutely great! The new expanded booklets offer more insight into each release, and the photographs are a great bonus. Most importantly, the sound is better than ever! I had no problem with the sound on the original discs; that is, until now. The bottom end is more prominent, and the overall sound is much clearer. You will notice things you didn't notice on the original discs. My only complaint is this: that within the digipacks they didn't include a plastic tray for each disc. Removing and replacing these discs in and out of the cardboard will certainly scratch, especially on the tightly packed white album. Thankfully I have special sleeves that I am keeping the discs in, which fit into the digipacks. I roughed up the front cover of the white album a little taking out one of the discs, which I am not happy about. But overall, I am still an extremely satisfied buyer! I definitely recommend it; but I also recommend placing the discs into their own sleeves or cases.[[ASIN:B002BSHWUU The Beatles Stereo Box Set]]

Get lucky did not let me down. I am thrilled that there's a bit of the \\"known\\" Knopfler and a bit of his \\"roots\\" in this work.

0061766089|3.0|Ironically, design thinking may have been the bane of this book. Despite the constant pitch for his company IDEO, the fundamental premise that linear thinking alone can bring about innovation is actually an interesting one (not necessarily new).  As a researcher in an inter-disciplinary domain, I couldn't agree more with that premise....However, the author fails to present that idea in a consumable manner - a sense of linearity is often needed for communication, especially if you are trying to reach a wider audience.  That lack of directness and direction, lack of useful visuals, lack of counter-examples of where design thinking failed makes this book a so-so read; only an ardent fan of IDEO can enjoy the book.   If the author had adopted a Harvard business school case-based approach to narrate his examples and at least provide a \\"solution space\\" to discern some repeatable lessons, the book would have clearly added value.  For someone totally new to the field, the book would come as a welcome distraction, though not singularly instructive.

B0012GMVG2|4.0|I ordered TOTO IV a few days ago on an impulse triggered by a memory. Or rather the memories of the early 80's. TOTO's Africa was playing on the radio and it instantly felt like all resistance was futile - MTV's  Moon landing promo clip - the one with the chainsaw - forced itself into my head, ZZ Top girls parading their legs possibly unaware that the Commissar was in town investigating the case of Video allegedly having killed the Radio Star. Science!!! - a voice was shouting - Dr. Dolby's team could surely prove that Billy Jean was never my girl. After all, we were all living in the Twilight Zone. Those were the last days of happy-go-lucky music and irresponsible fun.<br /><br />I had no choice but spend a few hard-earned dollars and get me the Africa CD - TOTO IV, that is. All I knew of TOTO until yesterday were Africa and Rosanna and that's what I wanted to listen to again and that's what TOTO IV delivers, with 8 more tunes in-between. Great 80's video tunes the two are. The rest... more Steely Danish-like pieces, what I would call coffee-table songs. Nicely and skillfully performed but forgettable. To be enjoyed but not to be missed.<br /><br />But I'm glad I had my Africa and my Rosanne, playing in my car. Kind of makes me feel like in those days and, having just traded in my gas-guzzling, thrill-making Mustang GT for a responsible and cautious hybrid, I need to feel like \\"the 80's\\" from time to time.

Her work is fantastic!
B002C6K7N0|4.0|\\"Endgame\\" may be Dave Mustaine's response to \\"Death Magnetic,\\" the 2008 opus by Mustaine's former band Metallica. In the past, Dave felt a rivalry to make his band better than the band that gave him the boot in 1983, but has claimed recently that he's put it all behind him... giving this disc a listen, one might feel that he still harbors some resentment... because he gives Metallica a run for their money.<br /><br />\\"Endgame,\\" Megadeth's follow-up to 2007's return to form \\"United Abominations,\\" is Megadeth mastermind Dave Mustaine's introduction of Chris Broderick, Glen Drover's replacement, to the Megadeth world. Metal fans are familiar with Broderick for his work with Jag Panzer, as well as a touring member of the metal monster that is known as Nevermore... however, it seems as though he has found a home in Megadeth.<br /><br />\\"Endgame\\" is nearly the perfect Megadeth album. It contains the right ingredients... lightning-fast guitar work, speeding rhythms, Dave Mustaine's sneering vocals, and a dark sense of humor... however it comes up lacking on some songs in the lyrics department.<br /><br />There are a couple of tracks on the album, namely \\"44 Minutes\\" & \\"Endgame,\\" that lack the intelligent lyrics Mustaine is known for. It's similar to reading a literal account of the events that are being described, and not with a \\"poetic sense\\" that Megadeth fans have come to expect from Mustaine's songs. Lyrics like \\"The two most violent men, it seemed, couldn't be stopped - Standard police issue guns were just not enough - But SWAT arrived and settled the fight - Between AK-47 and AR-15\\" from \\"44 Minutes\\" sound more like a news anchor's account of the story than the Mustaine lyrics we've grown accustomed to.<br /><br />The tracks on the album are relatively short, as well. The longest song is the title track, clocking in at 5:53. The rest are in between 2:25 and 4:41.<br /><br />But, on to the good stuff...<br /><br />Mustaine may have had some issues writing lyrics, but he obviously has no shortage of riffs in the head of his. The songs contain some of the most memorable, and technically superior, riffs that have ever graced a Megadeth album. Songs like \\"Bite The Hand\\" and \\"How The Story Ends\\" are simply air-guitar Heaven... distorted guitars, played with a fury that is rarely seen in modern music. His voice also seems to be in excellent shape for a man who's been sneering metal songs for over 25 years. His vocals really shine in the mix of this album, and the vocal harmonies in the choruses of songs like \\"Bodies\\" and \\"How The Story Ends\\" make him sound larger than life.<br /><br />While lyrics on a couple of tracks could use some work, the majority of the lyrics are spot-on, and contain the commentary and story telling, mixed with dark humor, Megadeth fans have come to expect. Dave's favorite topics are covered (war, politics, death, torture) but, he ventures to drag racing (\\"1,320\\") and love (\\"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\\").<br /><br />With \\"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\\" Megadeth tries its hand at what would be considered a love song, not unlike \\"Promises\\" from \\"The World Needs A Hero.\\" It does start out with acoustic guitars, and odd lyrics for Mustaine to sing... but it does transform into, musically, a typical Megadeth up-tempo song.<br /><br />Mustaine and Broderick work their instruments like madmen. The albums lead track, \\"Dialectic Chaos,\\" is a super-fast instrumental that featured Mustaine and Broderick trading solos and basically showing off. Broderick seems to be a perfect fit for Megadeth's style of metal, and certainly gets the opportunity to shine on this album. According to the liner notes, Broderick has 24 solos spread over the 11 tracks, compared to Dave's 17 solos. Broderick is also the first Megadeth guitarist to play a 7-string, and the extra B-string makes the sound that much heavier.<br /><br />\\"Endgame\\" is a fast-paced album... the songs, for the most part, chug through with speed and fury. Shawn Drover's drumming on this album is better than on \\"United Abominations,\\" and (dare I say) may be a better fit in Megadeth than Nick Menza was, not to take anything away from Menza. He handles the thrash beats without missing a step, and, when he lays down a groove, the head-banging gives you whiplash. The album's first single, \\"Headcrusher,\\" is his shining moment.<br /><br />The album is also bottom-heavy, thanks to bassist James Lomenzo. He has come a long way from backing Vito Bratta and Mike Tramp (That's right! He was a member of White Lion! How many of you knew that?), and his bass is very prevalant in the mix of this album. On \\"Bodies,\\" his bass carries the verses through the guitar breaks. Along with Drover, he anchors the band, while those other two lunatics melt your face.<br /><br />This may (Gasp!) be the most talented, technically proficient line-up Dave Mustaine has ever assembled, and \\"Endgame\\" clearly shows it. The production is spot-on, thanks to Andy Sneap. Sneap's work on the boards is the work of a true veteran, allowing it to be bottom-heavy, without sounding muddled. Broderick's 7-string is amazingly heavy, without taking away from the bass, and Mustaine's vocal performance is flawless... other than the lyrics on a couple of tracks, it is true Megadeth.<br /><br />Rejoice, children!

Although it isn't her best album I believe that honor goes to My Love is Your Love. Out of 11 tracks I like 10. The second track Nothin' But Love I find a bit jarring with her talk singing. Although her voice isn't what it once was, she still has a pleasant lilting vibe to her voice as displayed on A Song for You. I don't know if she'll win over new fans but I've always been a fan since hearing The Greatest Love of All on the radio when I was a wee girl in the eighties. Don't call it a comeback she's been here for years.

0385504225|4.0|In The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown uses the proven formula that brought him so much success in The Da Vinci Code. Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology, once again sets his wits against a mysterious and murderous foe, solving puzzles of history, art and the occult, in the company of a beautiful female companion. They race against time to find a mysterious object and rescue a kidnapped friend. Along the way we hear all about arcane subjects as diverse as Freemasonry, symbology, noetics, and the architecture of Washington DC.<br /><br />The pace of this novel is breathlessly fast, except for those moments when his characters turn into human textbooks, spouting background information. Although I found some of them fascinating, the reader can easily skim these sections without sacrificing much understanding of the plot. If his previous novels are any guide, this information may not be too reliable anyway!<br /><br />Mal'akh, Langdon's evil foe is brilliant, formidable, and bizarre. He has all the frightening characteristics you could hope for in a villain. He makes a worthy opponent to Langdon and Katherine, in a true battle of wits.<br /><br />The subject of The Lost Symbol should not generate as much controversy as his last novel. Brown is sympathetic to Freemasonry, and he doesn't portray masons as evil conspirators against history or knowledge. He espouses a belief in the divine nature of the human mind, like an Eckart Tolle of fiction, only with an anti-Christian grudge. I doubt that this novel will give rise to another cottage industry of books and films explaining where Mr. Brown fudged his facts, but the field of noetics might see a burst of interest.<br /><br />The final pages point to \\"facts\\" that may strain the reader's credulity, but this is an entertainment, not a manifesto. Although Mr. Brown has made some modest improvements in style, the text is still awkward in many places. I didn't read this book for the quality of his prose. I hopped on for the thrill of the ride. Dan Brown fans will be well satisfied with this novel, and they will doubtless climb aboard.

0307269981|5.0|I awaited THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE by Stieg Larsson with the same fervor that many possess with respect to the latest version of their favorite smart phone, video game, or film. The stories behind what have become known as the Millennium series, and their late author, are fascinating in their own right and well documented elsewhere; I would urge you to familiarize yourself, at least briefly, with both before undertaking this novel. If you have yet to read THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, it is not necessary to do so to fully enjoy the second volume of this amazing series. Larsson does a magnificent job in making new readers feel welcome, as well as bringing those familiar with the first installment up to snuff as to what has gone before. If THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was amazing, then THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is astonishing, perfect in every conceivable way.<br /><br />The Millennium series takes its name from a fictitious magazine, a publication of investigative journalism, that serves in the books as the nexus for all that occurs. Mikael Blomkvist, the publisher, is an interesting character, possessed of a steel-trap mind and a razor-sharp intellect. He is also a bit of a rake, if you will, having a number of \\"friends, with privileges,\\" including two of the ladies on the staff of the magazine. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO concerned what transpired when Blomkvist became involved with a waiflike woman named Lisbeth Salander, who among many other things saved Blomkvist's life and in some ways his career. We also learned that Salander is an extremely unusual, very dangerous individual, who is highly intelligent, capable of doing anything at any given time, and badly damaged.<br /><br />As THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE begins, approximately one year has passed since the events described in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO; Salander, for reasons unknown to Blomkvist, has terminated their relationship and has begun to impulsively travel. She is in Grenada as the book begins, working mathematical problems by the pool, taking a lover, and keeping an eye on a couple who are staying in the room next to hers. After an eventful, even breathtaking, series of occurrences, Salander returns home and begins to try to establish at least the trappings of a normal existence, using the proceeds from her ill-gotten gain to do so.<br /><br />Blomkvist, for his part, is settled back at the helm of his beloved Millennium, which will be publishing both a story and a book by a freelancing journalist/research couple who are preparing an expose on the Swedish sex-trafficking industry. Blomkvist's life violently intersects with Salander's again when Salander unexpectedly, though not inexplicably, becomes the primary suspect in a triple murder, the victims of which are the freelancing couple, as well as a third party who played a prominent role in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO; all of them are connected in some way to Salander. She becomes the subject of a police manhunt that is exploited to its limit, and beyond, by the press. And here we have but one of the examples of Larsson's genius.<br /><br />Salander disappears from the book as an active participant at this point, a little over a third of the way through, and does not reappear for a good while. As the tale unfolds, it seems entirely possible that she did commit one, if not all three, of the murders. At first Blomkvist is the only person who believes in her innocence. His investigation, carried on independently from that of the police, slowly begins to reveal Salander's past, the history of which sheds light on some, but certainly not all, of the reasons why Salander is the way she is, and additionally leads to the revelation of why the victims were murdered to begin with. By the time Salander reappears in the final third of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, she is more understandable, and much more frightening. The reader learns not of her limits, but of what she is truly capable and why.<br /><br />The book ends thunderously, and not without irony. By that time, you might be reading so quickly you'll overshoot the ending and start another book. But never fear. A third --- and apparently final --- volume, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS' NEST, is planned for publication in 2010. One can only imagine how that will begin, let alone end. It's not that there aren't any possible beginnings for the next book; it's that the conclusion of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE contains so many possibilities for what comes next.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson was an amazing author, and the manifestation of that conclusion continues to be so. For example, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO featured a fascinating character named Plague, who barely appears in THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE; though he plays an important role, he is barely present for two pages. A lesser or intellectually lazier author would have leaned on him more, having spent all sorts of blood, sweat, toil and tears creating him to start with. Not Larsson. He instead populated THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE with a new group of unforgettable characters, including a number from Salander's past, not the least of whom is Zala. Watch out for that one. There also is a series of seemingly pointless exercises in mathematics that, one might think, has nothing to do with the story but has much to do with this one and, I would guess, the next as well. And Grenada? I think that what happens on that beach will have repercussions down the road.<br /><br />Anyway, I've gone on too long already. Please read THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. Its 500-plus pages have the detail of a thousand, but you'll read them with the speed and intensity of a short story. This is the book that should sell five million copies, that people should stand in line for at midnight. Very strongly recommended, if you hadn't guessed already.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaubusly, and not without irony.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've looked at this movie and simply fell in love with it.  I've also read many reviews by Austen fans as well and I agree that this version leaves a lot out of the book and you wish there was more.  However, people must remember that the 2005 version of P&P is like any other version 'an adaptation' and can't possibly be an exact replica.  This movie in itself is great.  If you want more than what this 2-hour version had to give you must read the book or check out another version but don't discredit this version altogether.  If you had $30,000,000 and had to shrink a book into a two hour story, obviously you'd have to leave scenes and in some cases entire characters out just to get on with the story.  I think Joe Wright got it right in that this was a story about Lizzy and Darcy and everything else had to take a back seat.  Love this version, look at it with an open mind.
B0025KVLT2|4.0|The 2009 remaster of Rubber Soul is an improvement on the 1987 remaster,imho.  I received this from Amazon just two days ago (along with my Abbey Road remaster) and gave it a good side by side listen with my 1987 remaster.  I also ripped it to my iTunes player on my computer and checked them out there.  These are my aural observations.    I feel that the instruments are a bit brighter all around and the vocals more crisp.  The bass has more ooomph and the drums are also quite crisp.  I feel that much of the muddiness that was found in the previous remasters has been cleared, giving these songs a wonderful more vibrant quality.    The songs that I think were most improved by this remastering were What Goes On, Michelle, and The Word.  All of these seem to have more life to them than before.  As far as the song collection goes, this is the first \\"mature\\" Beatles album where they seem to be foreshadowing the coming works like Revolver and Pepper.    If you have a low to midrange stereo system, then you might just stick with the 1987 remasters.  However, with everything else, these remasters will be worthwhile.  Four stars.
B00004D3C1|1.0|I really thought this would be good after the reviews, but this is really a boring cd. Almost every song sounds the same and not for the good.
075640407X|5.0|I was at the library when I recognised this book from amazon's recommendations for me. Got it out, started reading. At about 3am the next morning I had been trying to convince myself that I should really go to bed for some time. Finished at about 4am.     Brief synopsis of what the book is about:  Most of the book is devoted to Kvothe telling the story of his life to Chronicler. Occasionally we return to the present time where Kvothe is hiding his identity by working as an innkeeper. It is clear from the outset of the book that this will be a tale long in the telling; this book only covers one day out of the three days Kvothe has allocated for telling his story to Chronicler. Besides this, we are given glimpses that in the present time everything is not right in the world; the roads are becoming increasingly unsafe to travel, weird creatures are attacking people. This will clearly need to be resolved in future books. Little hints are dropped to whet the appetite for further book. How did Kvothe get to be where he is now? How did he learn to fight? Where did he get all those names they mention on the book jacket? What will happen with the Chandrian (the baddies)?    Things I enjoyed:  This has a novel perspective and an interesting way of telling a tale. Quite different from the way most fantasy is told. In my opinion, Rothfus has deliberately chosen to tweak a few noses by starting the novel with exhibit A: cliched Hero Complete With Heroic Names and Successful Quests Already Handed In and then going back to the beginning. The book is about a boy who we know will be a great hero, but clearly is not one yet. Kvothe is an extraordinary boy, which seems logical given that he's supposed to end up as an extraordinary Hero. I also enjoyed the fact that boy-Kvothe is no fighter, his main claims to fame at this point being his intelligence and musical ability. Also, despite his natural born gifts, Kvothe is definitely capable of great stupidity.    Criticisms:  I do think that it would take Kvothe more than one day to recount all that he does to Chronicler in this book, especially because other events periodically interrupt them. I would be happier if in the next book, Kvothe finds he needs more days to tell his story. However, this did not affect my enjoyment of the story; as I was well able to suspend disbelief. Kvothe is larger than life; this book is the kind of book where Heroes that wouldn't work in the real world live. I think that this is deliberate and personally enjoyed this angle, but also think that Rothfuss was taking a bit of a risk by doing this. It's a bit different from classic fantasy. Also, the ending of this book is astonishingly abrupt. There was no neat 'beginning, middle, end' point to this book; it stops right between the beginning and middle. This is mostly a problem because the other books aren't out yet!     That being said, I very much enjoyed this book and if you are a fan of fantasy I highly recommend it.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Been waiting forever for this to come out on Blu-Ray, it's one of my favorite movies of all time and I'm not disappointed. The audio and video are top notch, many of the extras are carried over from the dvd but that's ok since the dvd already had a lot of material, the newly added Zomb-O-Meter is a really cool new feature. If you are a fan of the movie this is a must buy.

He was laughing outloud and did not even go out and play when the neighborhood boys came knocking on the door! He enjoyed this book immensely and was already asking me to call the library and put the second book on hold as he was reading this one! A great escape for him for at least a few hours!!!

I won't review the songs because other reviewers have already written their take and I agree with them. What I want to say is how this band is not HUGE in AMERICA is beyond me. Maybe PT likes it that way. Steven Wilson is pure magic and his writing skills are WAY ABOVE anyone today. Thank You Steven for the soundtrak music of our lives......................................
0307266303|5.0|I decided to read BORN TO RUN because of an interview with McDougall that was aired on the Daily Show by Jon Stuart.  My interest was motivated by the discussion of the Tarahumara runners.  They seemed super human.  As I read, a quote from Dirk Gently continued to enter my mind, \\"My own strategy is to find a car, or the nearest equivalent, which looks as if it knows where it's going and follow it.  I rarely end up where I was intending to go, but often I end up somewhere that I needed to be.\\"  My original purpose for reading BORN TO RUN was not satisfied, but rather I read something I needed to read.  Two issues stand out.<br /><br />First, back in the 1960's, I read a series of books written by the anthropologist, Carlos Castaneda.  Within the next decade, Castaneda's work was declared to be fraudulent.  I wish I hadn't tossed out these books.  I'm beginning to think his books were an accurate depiction of much of the events he addressed in his books -- just several thousand miles away.  It sounds like Castaneda's Don Juan was an elder among the Tarahumara.  I need to reread Castaneda's work.<br /><br />Second, it has been a long time since I've done any serious running, but vividly recall the intrinsic joy I found in it -- also as I aged, the pain I felt the next day.  McDougall points out that there is a positive correlation between the cost of running shoes and injuries associated with running.  That is, the more expense the running shoe, the greater the physical problems.  To understand the complexity of this strange association, one has to read the book.<br /><br />I didn't get what I wanted from McDougall's book, but I did get what I needed.  I highly recommend the book for those who were disappointed with Castaneda and those who are concerned about running injuries.

0525951113|3.0|Suarez lost me with the killer automated motorcycles two-thirds of the way in.  Robot cars I could swallow, but not the motorcycles. It's like the author had a product placement deal from Kawasaki.  A motorcycle indoors is about the stupidest idea imaginable. They really wouldn't corner all that well in a cubicle farm. Plus from the description they were top-heavy. Just tip the damned things over and you're done. I really had the feeling that somebody from Hollywood was reading over the author's shoulder at that point and told him to put in robot motorcycles, and oh yeah, a great big explosion or two.     Top-heavy robot motorcycles. Ah-hah! You missed me! I just ducked into my boss's cubicle!     I was really disappointed. Some of the earlier writing was really very, very good, and the characters were very well drawn. Unfortunately, some of the most interesting characters just disappeared or had a brief reappearance opening car doors later, after they were introduced.     The author seems to have lost it two-thirds of the way through the book and and then strained to put in Hollywood cliches after that.     The author, Gabriel Suarez, brought up some really clever cutting-edge ideas, like recruiting people in videogames (which the army is rumored to have done), and a distributed bot software program spanning the Internet that has an agenda (Doomsday/Conficker, etc.).  But some of the ideas were a little shaky.  Mythbusters busted the myth that low-frequency sonics can be useful for crowd control years ago, and the military confirmed that their research in the seventies on the concept went nowhere (or they'd be using on us all now).     The real sin is that Suarez doesn't make a persuasive case at the end of the book, and the poor guy left standing (I won't say who, but BOY can you see that coming a mile away!) is left as confused as the reader. So what the heck does the villain of the book, Sobol, have planned? It just all falls apart as the villain's \\"ghost\\" sinksinto the ground without explaining anything. Why the heck would the guy left standing trust Sobol and his vision for the future at that point?  Didn't Sobol ruin his life and his family's? It just all falls apart. My thought at that point was, \\"Is Suarez trying to lure us all in to demanding a sequel?\\"     Actually, there is a sequel on the way, as well as a possible movie. I'm not surprised, but I think they will rewrite the screenplay to combine the cop and the burned agent. They'll definitely keep the action scenes; I think it will come out looking a great deal like \\"Eagle Eye\\".     It's not at all bad for a first novel, but it just isn't as good as the hype on the back cover says it is.

0312944098|5.0|I began to panic towards the end of this book because I wanted it to go on and on. Such a good change from reading long books and groaning about how much I've still to get through. When Archer writes thrillers I don't think anyone can top him. This was at least as good as False Impression but you get into the characters more. It's supposed to be a modern version of The Count of Monte Christo but Archer has improved upon many things. He's also obviously learned a lot about prejudice itself and that it is like evidence against the accused, learned from his own trial and time in prison. Another great read.

B00006RAKP|5.0|The elton John cD arrived on time and in good condition, as   advertised!
B001TI3OFA|4.0|The most important lesson I learned from this book was that win win scenarios are possible.  All too often we believe that the other person having what they want excludes us having what we want, but a lot of the time that isn't true.  Most of the time what is most important to them is less important to us.  For instance, employers often think that salary is the most important factor in job satisfaction and although money is important to employees, recognition and empowerement are also important.      This book also taught me the importance of really listening to other people to determine what their pain points were and not making assumptions based on my own experiences.    Overall, this book is a keeper.
031604461X|5.0|I have ready many reviews for Breaking Dawn, both good and bad.  I think that the key to what you will think of the book is where you are coming from.  If you are a male or a young teenager or young adult, you may not understand where the author is coming from.  However, as a woman of similar age and background, I can understand why the author chose to go the way she did with the plot.  I can understand what it's like to not really be expecting a baby, but then knowing that you can't live without it as soon as you discover you are pregnant, especially when the child is that of someone you are madly in love with.  I do wish that there was more detail on the romantic scenes, because we had become used to that fromt he previous books, but sometimes open-ended is good, because you can paint the scene you want.  I think the author was creative with the broken headboard and the feathers, etc.  More action in the end would have been good, but I think that if you read carefully, you pick up on the fact that the danger is not over.  Someday the Italians are going to come after their coven.  They are not going to let this go forever.  We are left with real life in the end of the book...things are great, but you know they can't stay that way forever.  The future, even for the undead, is uncertain.  Overall, I loved the book and I can see that the author put all of herself in the book, because I see so much of myself in the book.

B002GZQY6Q|3.0|Just saw them last night in Seattle, where they started by performing the entire 55 minute title song of the new album. It was a really good show, and I like the new album, but I could really do without the unmelodic, wannabe Radiohead/Nine inch Nails influences Steve Wilson displays. To me, when they try so hard to be \\"modern and hip\\" is when Porcupine Tree go off the rails a bit.     If you want to see or listen to an incredible prog band, look no further than Sweden's Flower Kings. Much more melodic than Porcupine Tree, truly incredible guitar/keyboard interplay at a jaw dropping level of virtuosity,killer rythym section, and really good,nicely harmonized vocals. Also, really cool concepts and long songs, that never get boring. Would love to see these two bands tour together!

B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is one of James Cameron's finest, and one of the best movies ever made. This film is a wonderful blend of sci fi, horror, action, comedy and drama, seamlessly combined to make one near perfect movie. It's one you can watch over and over again and not get bored.   The film is also unique in that it is far superior to its original, Alien, which itself was a good sci fi horror movie. It's rarity for a sequel to surpass the original.  The film is perfectly cast, well acted, with great set design and special effects, a perfectly fitting musical score and an excellent plot.   The special edition has some dvd extras and adds 17 minutes of deleted scenes back into the film. My favorite extra on dvd's is the deleted scenes and to have them reedited into the film was a thrill. None of the scenes were bad, though I can see why some were deleted for timing or spacing reasons. Its especially fun on a movie like this to see the extra scenes, cause its a little more of the story you were never told. I personally thought the automatic gun scene should have been left in the original.
0439023491|5.0|I can say I love the 2nd book as well. I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I'll be sitting on pins and needles until the 3rd installment comes out.<br />The 2nd book start a few months from where the first book left off. Things will never be the same for Katniss (or for anyone around her) after the Games. Things have changed and no matter how much she wishes it would stay the same, she knows this isn't going to happen. One day, when she arrives home, she finds that she has a visitor. It is President Snow (the last person she wants to see). Snow threatens her and tells her she needs to become more believable to the people about her and Peeta's love. If she doesn't succeed, all the ones that she loves will be punished. She also finds out about a lot of turmoil going on in the other districts. Could there be an uprising going on? This blended in with all that she's going through provides a none stop story that I couldn't keep my nose out of. It was a page turner for sure.<br />If you loved the Hunger Games, I am sure you'll love this one. It just as fast paced and leaves you with a cliff hanger making you beg for more. I highly recommend this book.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|I watched this film expecting perhaps a good horror movie.  Imagine my surprise when I started watching it.  I don't know why I watched this film really.  It was that disgusting.  A young girl gets raped (they spend a lot of time on the rape scene, maybe up to 5 minutes, making it as nasty and gross as possible).  And at the end they microwave him.  No point other than to show an innocent girl get brutally raped by a psychopath.  Sick stuff for anti-social freaks.  A true sign of cultural degeneration in our time.
B002C6K7N0|3.0|I had high hopes for this one.  The last two albums have been quite refreshing after the previous three (Cryptic..., Risk, ...Hero).  Endgame is lyrically and vocally my least favorite Megadeth album.  It could have been one of the better ones if it wasn't for those.  Musically, it's quite impressive.  But there just aren't any catchy tunes.  As good as it is musically, and production-wise, it just isn't enough to overcome the vocal/lyrical belly-flop Dave took on this one.      \\"When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat\\"???  Erm...  If you're a dog, you're a dog, whether or not you eat other dogs, Dave...      \\"They ball-gagged Lady Justice - and blindfolded her so she can't see\\"  -As if there's any uncertainty as to the function of a blindfold?  And, Blind Justice is a good thing.  The problem now is that they're removing her blindfold, bringing subjectivity into Justice.  THAT's when it becomes \\"dog eat dog\\", dawg...    Yes, these lines are from the same song, but the rest of the lyrics offer little more in the way of substance and/or cogency.  It's like the lyrics were an afterthought - as if they finished the album and said \\"Oh Yeah. Words...\\"  Dave's down-tuned vocals only add to the frustration created by the lyrical bilge.  5 stars for musicianship - minus two stars for vocals/lyrics (that's being generous!).
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.    Coming from someone who loves Madonna, Stevie Nicks, Michael Jackson. This is one of my favorite cd's of all time. I absolutley love each song to pieces.  The album is very dark pop/electro, and it's enhoyable from start to finish    My favorite songs are How soon is Now, Stars, 30 minutes, and of course the classic Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things she Said.    BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!  You have to listen to it! it's phenomenal!!
B00005N5S5|5.0|Terminator is one of the greatest movies ever made and is among the top favorites for almost anyone I know. This is the film that really made James Cameron and Arnold, stars in their field.   An excellent story, with perfect theme music, made this an instant classic, one you can watch over and over again. A thrilling, sci-fi, action horror classic, with a bit of a love story mixed in. The only negative critique I've ever had about the film is the scene where Arnold removes the eye, and his face clearly looks like a mask.   The deleted scenes on the disk are fun to watch but they are not re-edited into the film as they did in Aliens. I wish they had done that or given you the option too, because I really enjoyed it that way. Most of the scenes were taken out for timing or pacing and otherwise could have been left in. I particularly thought the Cyberdyne ending could have been left in. I find it really enjoyable to watch deleted scenes on older favorites like this.

0752866850|2.0|I listened to the audio version which highlighted one of Ludlum's greatest problems: he has a tin ear for dialogue and when you have to listen to the stuff that comes out of these people's mouths, well, I kept replaying snippets for my wife, so she could laugh and roll her eyes. Gave it an extra star for a great concept, but had to give up on the thing about 70% through. Painfully funny became just... painful.
0439023483|4.0|Read about The Hunger Games in Times Magazine.  Bought book the next day.  Let's say, I'm middle-aged so a book geared more toward young teenagers gave me some reservations.  They quickly were put to rest.   This is great story, lots of fun, new spin on getting back at the man, plus a very likeable character in Katniss.  My Father is an author, with a book on Amazon, so I gave it to him afterwards.  He throughly enjoyed the concept and character development.  High praise indeed! I've already started Catching Fire.  I see movie written all over The Hunger Games.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Simply put: awesome.  I'm a huge Beatles fan, and Electric Arguments is the best thing I've heard by one of the Fab Four outside of the Beatles catalog.  I can't recommend it enough.  Paul McCartney (all instruments) and Youth (producer) reunite for their third album.  I've heard their earlier stuff; don't expect much of that if you're already familiar with it.  This time around, they find the perfect blend of classic rock, progressive rock, blues, and electronica (don't let that scare you away).  There's also some pop thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Electric Arguments can be divided into two halves.  The upbeat half (tracks 1-8) and the mellow progressive half (tracks 9-13).  The second half might be a little offsetting to people who aren't used to the genre, but it's well done and a great introduction to progressive rock.<br /><br />*Nothing too Much Out of Sight - (9/10) Remember \\"Helter Skelter?\\"  Screaming McCartney makes his glorious return.  Great harmonica, thundering bass.  The howling at the end is a nice touch.<br />*Two Magpies - (8/10) A nice acoustic guitar driven song.  Sounds like typical McCartney.<br />*Sing the Changes - (9/10) Feels like the anthem of the album.  This is the type of song that's meant to be played in a stadium.  Probably because of the echo effects.<br />*Traveling Light - (8/10) Here's where progressive influences become noticeable.  Good song to play in a car at night.<br />*Highway - (10/10) I love this song.  It's a straight up rocker with a great piano beat.<br />*Light From Your Lighthouse - (9/10) Very catchy song.

Probably my favorite off the album.  Set this one to your alarm clock.  It paints a great picture of the title.<br />*Dance 'Til We're High - (9/10) Continues with the tone of Sun is Shining.  Except now there's an orchestra!  Great conclusion to the first half.<br />*Lifelong Passion - (8/10) Mellow, murky, and earthy.<br />*Is This Love? - (8/10) Mellow, murky, and desperate.  Beautiful song.<br />*Lovers in a Dream - (7/10) A hazy electronica track that veers off into the abstract.<br />*Universal Here, Everlasting Now - (7/10) A calming piano plays while a dog barks and an alarm clock goes off.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I saw Titanic three times in the theater, and enjoyed it each time. The first time the theater was packed, and it was amazing how this movie drew the audience in, including myself. I didn't see any dry eyes in the theater by the end of the film.   Outstanding set design and effects, a wonderful musical score and and a timeless love story, are all used to retell the sinking of the Titanic. The historical points of film are surprisingly accurate and it inspired me to read up on other historical facts the movie couldn't get into.   This movie holds up well and is one of my all time favorite films. Class and gender warfare, are interesting backdrops to the love story. For a story you essentially already know whats coming, this film really kept you on the edge of your seat.   The extras on this collector's edition are well worth getting, with among other features, an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes. Many of the deletions are simply the extra footage of shortened scenes that did make the movie, and frankly much of the extra scenes could have been left in the movie. However the film was already long by most standards, and timing and pacing reasons dictated most of the cuts. One 3 minute gun chase scene was properly deleted in its entirety. The somewhat alternate ending was fun to see, but the theatrical version was clearly the right choice.   Thew three disc version is the one to get, for all its extras.
B000003C4K|5.0|There are some that think this album is overrated or that Metallica and Slayer's early work is better but they're wrong.  If you don't like this album you're wrong, listen to it again.  Listen to it until you like it, love it.  When I first bought this years ago I listened to it once and didn't listen again for about a year, then I listened to it again, then again, and again and again and now when I listen to Bonded By Blood you could stop the first track 10 seconds in and I'd be able to play the rest in my mind with no problem.    If you don't have this, GET IT, if you don't like it, LEARN TO ...because this is about as raw as thrash gets.
0307277887|1.0|The Dexter character is great, and Showtime made him even better (deeper, funnier, more layers) than he is in the book. For creating Dexter, the character and Dexter, the overall concept, Lindsay deserves whatever wealth and fame he may get.     But he's also fortuate that Showtime has so brilliantly transformed Dexter into a better written character and a more riveting and yet concise story (in each episode/season that is).
B00243FQFA|5.0|Why you'd want to own this even though you saw the season on TV: it has not only the standard features common to all the SGA seasons (lots of commentaries with the producers and directors, Mission Directive featurettes, deleted scenes, photo galleries, and so on) BUT ALSO expanded versions of the last two episodes Vegas and Enemy at the Gate -- the eps are longer with the additional footage, and are edited better than the TV-aired ones.  I watch for the characters, and enjoyed the new footage with new dialogue for Vegas.

B0015AARJI|3.0|This is the standard old Play Station style controller with a rumble pack. It has the added feature of a motion sensor system in it.    So far I have not had any games that take advantage of the motion sensor.    The battery life on both of the controllers I have is abhorrent. They will die off with only 2-3 hours of solid use or if you don't put them on the charger they will be dead over night. Since one of them came with my system and the other I bought 3 months later I would be left to believe this is simply a bad design instead of a bad batch of controllers.    Over all the controller does what it is supposed to but for the common price if 59$ I would not buy one. I found one here on amazon for a nice price and it came a with wireless guitar so Amazon made it worth purchasing a second one.

0061733199|5.0|I own and love this book. It is a super comprehensive guide to surviving all sorts of extreme emergencies in a variety of geographic zones and climates. Plane crashes, car crashes, getting lost in the wilderness, tsunamis, earthquakes, terrorist attacks - you name it, book covers it!    The author is an authority on survival, being the former survival instructor or the British SAS special forces troops, which operate around the world, from arctic to desert zones, and from big cities to remote jungles. Tone is very down-to-earth, and straight to the point. The book is easy to read and understand and does not assume or need any prior knowledge of military and survival techniques (which is the author's background). I am a former search-and-rescue team member and trained wilderness first-aid responder, and I find the information in this book first rate.    The content is very densely concentrated, so reading it once will not make you an expert. To make the best of this book, you need to practice some of the survival techniques. The best way is probably to go camping and backpacking, but you can try a lot of them in your own backyard.    The book overemphasizes outdoors survival (what plants to eat, how to fish and catch animals), which is due to the author's background as a special forces soldier. For more on urban disaster preparedness, read Cody Lundin's book \\"When All Hell Breaks Loose\\". Unlike Cody Lundin and many American survival books, the SAS Guide is refreshingly free of political statements and sticks strictly to the topic of survival :) The SAS Guide is about surviving a relatively localized and temporary emergency (measured in days, not years), and assumes you will eventually be helped, rescued or return to civilization. If you are interested in long-term survival of a total global catastrophe (aka \\"survivalism\\"), this is not the best guide.    It is such a great book that I am planning to buy more copies, to keep in my car, take when traveling, and give tofriends. Highly recommended!
B0025KVLTM|1.0|These remastered CD's are a rip-off.  You cannot load them into your computer as a lot of people wish to do. The stupid documentary comes up every time.  I am returning mine as the only way you can play them is on a CD player which I don't wish to do.
B0025KVLTC|1.0|The music on the CD sounds great.  There is a mini-doc language problem.  While commenting on the backward guitar used on the album Lennon mentions the fact that the Beatles were the first to use the technique before Hendrix and other f*****s.  How did this make it on the mini-doc and what were they thinking?   Parents beware!  If your younger kids are Beatle fans don't buy this. Buy the version without the mini-doc!
031604461X|5.0|I loved the movie and then I read the books and now I am depressed because I can't find another book that is as intense or filled with unconditional love as this series. I only wish the series had at least one more book. The very end of breaking dawn was as if Meyer had run out of steam and wanted to just shut the story line down quickly. Other than that I haven't been able to find another book that can even hold a candle to this series.
0385504225|2.0|I loved Angels and Demons and greatly enjoyed the DaVinci Code.  This is more on the level of Deception Point (another book which demonstrated a total ignorance of the real world and how Washington works).<br /><br />The book starts with an improbable beginning, throws in a stereotypical security officer (wow, a dragon lady, that is orginial), mixes in some nebulous pseudo-science and then goes masonic on us.  I found the locations interesting, but the characters are cardboard.  The only character that actually interested me dies, and even that didn't engage me.<br /><br />In the prior Langdon books I knew something about what was at stake (the papacy/the Vatican, the holy grail) but here I had no idea, other than single rich and powerful man with a tragic life, his sister, and mysterious claims of national security and some ominous secret.  It really didn't keep me wanting more.<br /><br />One of Brown's themes, which he ends the book on, is the power of hope.  It was hope that drove me to finish the book, a hope that it would redeem itself.  I guess I need to save up my remaining hope for his next book (if I have enough left by then).
B002OHK7CS|5.0|The program is violent-- there are times when I have difficulty watching it.  But it's worth it! Great show!
B002C6K7N0|4.0|This album totally rips. It feels like classic Megadeth infused with modern relevance and a real sense of purpose. Prroduction is excellent and the musicianship is great. Vocals have never been the strong point of Megadeth but this album is as passable as any. What id does lack is memorable chorus's on many of the tracks. I currently would place this album 5th right after the classic 4 Mega-albums. It may go higher in time. This is how I have them ranked so far    Rust In Peace (greatest thrash album of all time) 10/10  Peace Sells... 9/10  Killing is My Business... 8/10  So far So Good So What 7.5/10  Endgame 7.5/10 (will likely move up)  The System had Failed 7/10  United Abominations 6/10  Countdown to Extinction 5/10  The World Needs a Hero 4/10  Youthanasia 4/10  Cryptic Writings 4/10  Risk 2/10

0385504225|3.0|I think it has taken quite a few years for Brown to finish The Lost Symbol and I do wonder just why it took so long.  Overall I found it to be a B- thriller (3 stars) and I'm being more than generous.  If you read the Da Vinci Code you will find that The Lost Symbol is very similiar except that it takes place in Washington, D.C. and not in Rome.  Harvard Symbologist Langdon is summoned to Washington by his friend and encounters the dead hand pointing up to the Rotunda.  Just like in Da Vinci, in fact the whole book uses the same formula and structure--although there is much more action.  But it does get to be stupid with this 50 year old Harvard Professor doing his own stunts...c'mon the guy is definitely NOT Special Forces--he's a 50 year old Harvard Professor. Very difficult to believe some of it.    Anyway, if you read Da Vinci Code you can easily predict what is going to happen next and it does get pretty boring.  It is a nice little read if you don't think about what you are reading.  It's a thriller, not literature but Brown's writing definitely needs a skilled editor to finesse his writing. I had to force myself to finish it. Your mileage may vary, but I find this book way over-hyped.    But, maybe if you are in a plane or a train or a bus with a few hours to kill--this is good entertainment.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|It happens to every band; it's practically a cliché.  At some point in an artist's career, he or she will want to spread their wings and try something a bit (or sometimes drastically) different than their fans are used to.  Before The Resistance came out, I went back on a Muse binge and listened to their albums.  What I discovered when I finally started listening to The Resistance was that this album was inevitable.  And the reviews here and elsewhere on professional sites/magazines are also inevitable: some proclaiming it Muse's masterpiece, others that its a bad album.  As you can probably tell, I'm in the former category.    The Resistance kicks off with \\"Uprising,\\" a track that seems to partake of the Dr. Who Theme Song and has a guitar flourish that first reminded me of the chorus to Blondie's \\"Call Me.\\"  This song has an electro, pulsating beat that continues the kind of electro-trend from \\"Supermassive Black Hole.\\"  It took me a bit to feel its groove and now I'm in love.  The third track--easily the album's most \\"controversial\\" song--is funky in an R&B way, mixing some hip-hop sounds with electronica and some nice thumping rock thrown in.  It's an amalgamation of so many different sounds that it's probably Muse's most adventurous.    Of course there's \\"United States of Eurasia,\\" which people have already decried as a ripoff of Queen.  While it definitely does have a Queen influence, it's not unique in Muse's catalogue.  You could see this direction in \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" which I found to be more Queen-like than \\"Eurasia.\\"  Also I was a bit surprised to see it end with a twist of Nocturne In E-Flat Major, Op.9 No.2 by Frédéric Chopin.  You could tell that Matt Bellamy and company had a thing for classical music in some of their earlier music, but this is where it really hones in.  Following this track is another classical-styled song, this time courtesy of the opera Samson and Delilah, entitled \\"I Belong to You (+Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix).\\" Finally, asif to hammer this thought home, we have a three part symphonic monster of a song that incorporates a full orchestra and Matt on piano.  This song is epic and moving, bringing in influences not only from Chopin but also Franz Liszt.  Each movement blends well into the next; the flowing arpeggios in \\"Overture\\" lead into the tinkling keys of \\"Cross-Polination\\" which climaxes with a rock section before ending with \\"Redemption,\\" a nice outro that ends the CD.  It's fantastic and a perfect closer for The Resistance.    Thematically, The Resistance covers all the same topics fans come to expect, including love, standing up for what you believe in and a variety of political and conspiracy theories.  \\"United States of Eurasia\\" references the book The Grand Chessboard concerning a political theory that the United States should control the Eurasian landmass for oil reasons.  Other songs follow suit, with proclamations of \\"I want the truth!\\" (\\"Unnatural Selection\\") and \\"Rise up and take the power back, it's time that / The fat cats had a heart attack\\" (\\"Uprising\\").  Nothing really new here, but done with the typical Muse flair.    And here we come back to the beginning.  The Resistance isn't for everyone and I can definitely empathize with those turned off.  It wears its classical leaning on its sleeve for all to see and indulges in enough modern pop and hip-hop styles that will make people who raised their eyebrows at \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" really wonder what they're listening to.  But it's been an inevitable journey, taking their latest albums as inspiration.  It's definitely not for everyone and your mileage may vary.  For me, though, The Resistance is almost pitch perfect and a modern classic that will stay in my CD Player for quite a long while.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|There are very few metal bands that I will listen too and Megadeth is one of them.  This album is superiorly instrumental-intense and vocally aggressive.  I'm not sure why so many people that listen to speed-thrash metal are so worried about vocals.  You can't have Frank Sinatra singing to thrash speed metal.  Modern rock singers can't and shouldn't even try to sing to it.  It is a beast of its own.  If you ever listen to Ozzy Osbourne, every song he sings is flat or tuned down but it sounds good.  Then you have incredible singers like Dio, who does sing and in key but a lot of people don't like it because they think it's too over the top.  The way Dave Mustaine sings fits with the music he's playing and vice versa.  This album is easily up there with Rust in Peace and Peace Sells.  Chris Broderick shreds like nobody's business and Drover....well his drumming speaks for itself.  Dave, keep making albums like this and I will keep buying them.    \\"Having eyes but cannot see, having ears but cannot hear\\"    Thomas

B0028K3192|5.0|The first few listens of the whole album did not impress me. In fact I was feeling downright disappointed. But then I stepped back and thought 'I need to give this a real good listen.' I put it on during a long car ride and I focused in on the vocals and music and how it made me feel and kept referring to the lyrics on the CD cover. I fell in love! Now it is on all the time and I can't wait for the concert here in LA. We have to grow with the artist and this is what I felt happened, I grew with Maxwell as opposed to expecting the same thing as the previous CDs. Remember, though it is only 9 tracks it is part of a trilogy, 2 more CDs are coming annualy.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|The Bottom Line:    It's easy to get holier-than-thou about this appealingly-old fashioned film (at its core it's a very common star-crossed-lovers-who-won't-get-together-until-Act 3 type of film) but it's directed with verve, acted with intensity, set up with an incredibly interesting gimmick that holds the film together; you'd have to have a heart of stone to not be impressed with the kinetic style and undeniable charm of this deserved (or at least not undeserved) Best Picture winner.    3.5/4

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love this series, and only by the writers strike a couple years ago did I come upon it. Our local CBS affiliate showed season 1 instead of regular reruns. After purchasing the 2nd season of Dexter, I was looking forward to the release of season 3.  Amazon sent me an announcement of their release of the 3rd season, and seeing the price, I couldn't believe it. It was, including my shipping cost, cheaper by $6 of any other offered sale.  I have once again, been pleased with my Amazon purchase.  Thanks much,  Davel
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Seriously, I have been salivating for this album for weeks.  Literally listening to the samples of the MP3 like a desperate ex-girlfriend turned stalker.  Muse did not disappoint me.  You will definitely hear sections of music that remind you of Queen or remind you of metal riffs from the 70's and 80's.  Please don't let it frighten you.  Embrace it.  In a way this album feels like a walk through an anthology of music history. From classic piano pieces (as featured at the end of United States of Eurasia) to modern day amalgamations of sound.  Lyrically, everyone will find an anthem to proclaim their rebellious streak.  Writer's out... from one writer to another... this album might inspire a scene, a character, a referenced line.  It already has my creative wheels churning.  Resistance, United States of Eurasia, Exogenesis Part I, Undisclosed Desires, and I Belong To You might just turn out to be the most played tracks out of my album.  All in all, I think you can take the hint that I very much love this album.  If you think you might have a tendency to agree... then show Muse some love and buy the album.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|This is yet another ultimate movie from Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington, and Russell Crowe. This is not just a gangster flick, but, like The Godfather & Heat, is also a psychological drama. It tells the story of Frank Lucas, an African-American man who becomes a #1 drug importer in 60's Harlem. Richie Roberts is the cop who's willing to bring Lucas and his tainted business down. Seems like a simple story, but the film itself is far more complex. There is more story than action (not to say it is bad, but it really stands out with other awe-inspiring motion pictures). Ridley Scott simply knows how to make a great film, and this is one of his greatest. The performances here are also memorable. Washington, Crowe, Brolin, Gooding Jr., Nadal, Dee, Common, and T.I. give their roles their all, and they do it almost flawlessly. I'm surprised Washington wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. And the costumes and sets are just ravishing! It really feels like you're back in the late 60's, where you're anticipating the most intense boxing night in history.<br /><br />It's not as great as other gangster/cop flicks, but it's great on its own level. Grade: A
B00005221M|5.0|I purchased the THEATRICAL Vers. on Amazon UK. Shipped to the US was $12 US.  I plan to use Slysoft AnyDVD or DVD-Decryptor (free) to remove the region and burn to a DVD+DL. That should take all of 30 mins and it is still cheaper than the US directors cut.      There is a lot of talk about how superior the theatrical version is.  Having only seen the directors cut, I am eager to watch the theatrical cut.  BTW I really enjoyed the directors cut but it seems that most of the criticism is accurate, I am just not easily bothered by extra footage.    Peace.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I saw ET at the premiere in 1982 and have not seen it since then until I picked up the DVD set a few days ago. Without too much embellishment I have the same feeling for it now that I did then: this is one of the best motion pictures ever made. How could I have remembered every scene from 2 decades past, nearly every significant word of dialog, every note of the score, if it had made no impression on me from the first viewing? Because it went straight to the parts of me that define me as HUMAN. It would be pointless to over-critique ET; small and trivial aspects of it have lost their luster. So there is an ATARI console, so Drew Barrymore has taken on less sweet roles as an adult. The cheesy effects in The Wizard Of Oz do nothing to detract from the essence of the film. In this case the essence is the same: Home. It is a word that is as intangible to define as freedom or truth or....faith. \\"Phone home\\" he says, \\"There's no place like home.\\" says Dorothy. THIS is the essence of the movie...it does not take a Roger Ebert or Leonard Matlin to uncover this fundamental (and yes, sentimental) truth. Spielberg captured all that was possible to capture on film about the nebulous nature of needing to be home. For each of us, for every human being, there is a place we call home. It may not be the place we live now, or it may not even exist anymore except in our memory, perhaps we shall never find such a place. But we all know what it shall be like when we are there. Spielberg's film says that the concept of home is not only a human desire, but perhaps even a universal one as well.  I think he is right.  I believe if you don't understand or feel these feelings after viewing then somewhere along the road of your life you have lost some part of your humanity. True,it is just a movie. And Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is just another song. And The Last Supper is just another fresco...
0547258305|4.0|Things I liked:  -I loved Katsa, she was strong, independent and she just [...].  -Katsa Grace of killing/survival was a really neat concept and I loved learning about it and about all the other graces people possessed.  -I liked that the author chose names for the countries that corresponded with directions, Nander, Sunder, (North, South) etc. It made it easy to follow where they were travelling so I didn't have to constantly look at the map in the front of the book.  -I loved Bitterblue, she was so strong for a 10 year old.  -This book was written in 3rd person which I tend to enjoy more than 1st  -The plot/characters strongly reminded me of the Song of the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce, which is a good thing because I love her books and I haven't found anything else that comes even close to her stuff.  -I loved that (spoiler) she didn't end up marrying Po, and that they were happy like that, I thought it fit right.  - I liked the dialog and writing, it was simplistic without being dumbed down overly descriptive, I hate it when authors dumb down stuff or explain things over and over because they are writing for a teen audience.    Things I disliked:  -I thought that the book could have been split into two, a lot was shoved into the last 150 pages or so, and I think I would have preferred it spread out a little more into a sequel.  -I actually hated Po at the beginning of the book and I wanted Katsa to marry Giddon because I liked him better, Po grew on me though, and I ended up enjoying the ending.    Overall I really liked this book, although I really didn't think I would when I picked it up, I'm glad I was pleasantly surprised. It had everything I enjoy in a story, princesses, damsels in distress, girls who [...], action, fist fights, hot men, need I go on? A really solid debut book and I look forward to more from Kristin. Although this book is marketed for YA 14 and up I believe, I think this is more suited for older teens/adults it is quite violent for a teen book.    I give this a 4.5 out of 5
0375413405|5.0|I fell in love with this book the moment I saw it. It's so vintage looking and that made me want to buy it.

B0026RHR6K|5.0|I am always done with season 4.5 and can see why people say the things they say.  I believe season 1 and 2 each episode leaves you usually with a good feeling.  When you get to season 3 and 4 there are some episodes that leave you with such a great feeling and others that are more forgettable.  It's just like the stock market, it goes up and down consistently.  I may have likes 4 episodes in a row than maybe disliked 2 and so on.  Just because I didn't like a certain episode doesn't mean it was bad, it just went off course.  I see a lot of complaints about season 3 and 4 and that is simply because if you don't like the direction season 3 and 4 go than you simple won't like those seasons.  In my opinion season 1 and 2 would be gold, 3 is silver and 4 would be a bronze.  It still throws every curve ball at you and the acting is excellent and get to be the best in season 3 and 4.  Overall, this show does throw some predictable drama at you, but the amount of it, coupled by all the things that you won't see coming makes this show worth every penny.
0385504225|2.0|Friends, do yourselves a favor and don't waste money on this one of Dan Brown's.   I would say I was disappointed, but honestly, I wasn't expecting much to begin with, and for that matter didn't get much out of reading this book.     Whereas the Davinci Code was filled with at least useful/interesting tidbits about various locations, word origins, religious history along the journey, this book provides only a little bit of that for about 5 chapters during their escapade in the US Capitol building, and then descends into rambling bull about spiritualist nonsensical gibberish, interspersed with some strained plot devices.      At times, I could see whole plot segments lifted out of his previous works, like Angels and Demons.  I.e. chase scenes in a high security area, and who the antagonist actually turns out to be, etc.     Honestly, I found myself skipping through several pages at a time when I could see they involved long dissertations on the pseudo-religious/spiritualist crap that has little relevance to the story.     Finally, the story/plot line is a little bit contrived even for Dan Brown action sequences.  And there is a heavy tinge of deus-ex-machina going on here, with plot predicaments rescued by non-sequitur technology or just ignoring what happened two pages before.  The final resolution of the secret was also pretty lame, like a bad coffee after a mediocre meal.     For those in the know, don't waste your money -- just pick up the free copy on Bittorrent...

B000KX0IOA|5.0|This film is a story about a father of modern India and his fight for freedom.  He chose a path of peace and tolerance between religions and ethnicity's in his country.He believed in tolerance and God's way which the other side didn't respect.  The first half of the film covers 1893 through about 1919, during which time Mohandas K. Gandhi ages from 23 to about 49. This part of the movie shows a few episodes from the 21 years that Gandhi spent in South Africa, trying to force the government to change laws that discriminated against Asians because of their race. During these struggles, Gandhi developed his strategy of nonviolent civil disobedience to unjust laws that eventually served as a model for many political movements around the world.  Gandhi continues to provoke the British authorities using nonviolent civil disobedience, is in and out of prison several times, and goes on periodic hunger strikes to influence events. Gandhi comes to be revered by the Indian people, and he becomes widely known as Mahatma, meaning great-souled. Eventually, the British resolve to keep India a colony is worn down, and in 1947 India is granted independence.But Gandhi's dream of a politically unified Indian subcontinent where religious preference would not be an issue didn't work out: The predominantly Muslim areas were partitioned into the separate country of Pakistan, and what was left became the predominantly Hindu country of India. The partition left a legacy of massive displacement and bloody violence. Gandhi traveled into troubled areas, conducting prayer vigils and fasts, but on one of these visits in 1948 he was assassinated by a Hindu extremist.  Today many political and social movements in the world follow Gandhi's ideas,and my opinion is that Gandhi put fundament of religious tolerance in moder world.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|...Star Wars - Clone Wars, the epic events we finally get to witness after hearing about it in the 1977 release of Episode IV A New Hope.  The years have passed since 1977 and one could only speculate what the Clone Wars were about.  The theatrical releases of Episode II and III gave us a bit more insight as to what they were like at the end of the Clone Wars and at the beginning of the Galactic Empire.  But in this modern-day mythology we get to dive in to the heart of the Clone Wars and see the line running between Episode II and Episode III something they don't explain well in the movies is that much time passes between each.    ...Star Wars - Clone Wars is a brilliantly stylized and developed animated television show, which allows you to submerse yourself into the Star Wars Universe and take part in a separate adventure each episode.  In each episode you get to explore the personalities and relationships of Jedi, the Clone Troopers, as well as the Villains and see how they interact with one another.    ...George Lucas set up the rules and universe in which these characters live in, but it's good to see how other artists and story tellers put their own ideas together to bring us this great series and allow the mythology of Star Wars to live slightly out of the hands of George Lucas.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|I would never have re-watched this film if not for a discussion series on Wells I was hosting but....the sacrifices we make. Simon Wells' film has even less to do with his great-grandfather's novel than the 1960 version, in fact changing the whole motivation of the main character so that he can even more readily dispense with any of the philosophizing and social theorizing that has helped to keep the novel still relevant and interesting today.<br /><br />In this film, the setting has been moved from London to New York though it's still the Victorian '90s. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a physics professor about to ask for young Emma's (Sienna Guillory) hand in marriage when she is killed by a mugger. In grief, he sets about inventing a time machine so that he can go back and save her. Wouldn't you? Four years later he's ready, but he quickly finds out that he can't change the past, as that would keep him from building the machine and that would be a paradox. Of course, the paradox of his machine appearing 4 years before it was built in his laboratory or the possibility of him running into himself are never dealt with at all, and this sets up the bad action/thriller pattern in place for the rest of the film: throw logic out the window and when something needs to happen just do it and hope the audience won't notice.<br /><br />He quickly decides to go off into the future. No real reason why -- no discussions of mankind becoming noble and true, as there was in the novel -- nope, he just wants to get out of Dodge apparently. After a longish stop in 2030 where he meets a holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) and somehow glosses over the fact that he apparently died in 1903 - the year he left - and a short one in 2037 as he witnesses the moon break up (cue cool digital effects) he is knocked unconscious on his machine and stays in a daze while the world changes around him, until finally awakening in the year 802,701. Given that 36 minutes have passed by now out of the under 85 (leaving off end credits), you know the action's going to have to come fast and furious and the strangeness and wonder - that still excite this lover of the novel - are going to be in short supply.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that he quickly meets the Eloi, the surface people, led (more or less) by Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is the only adult in the tribe to speak English which is learned by all of them as kids but forgotten by most; she's the teacher though and of course remembers it, can speak intelligibly and is able to lead Hartdegen eventually to the ruins of the library where, miraculously, the electronic librarian still works. But wait, there's a cog in the machinery! Alongside the wonderfully mixed-race Eloi (the sole interesting touch in the film) there's a race of dead-white monstrous super-ape-like thingies, the Morlocks, who are faster, stronger, and like to eat Eloi-flesh. The Eloi of course just accept that their old, feeble, and sometimes others just get taken away - despite being reasonably smart and sophisticated in this version (in the novel and the 1960 film the Eloi are quite feeble and it's not at all surprising that they can't or won't fight back). In short order Mara is captured and our hero has to venture down below where he meets the supreme Morlock, an idiotic conception who can read minds, is super-strong and controls the other Morlocks but who of course gets bested rather quickly by the monkey-faced Pearce/Hartdegen. He's played by Jeremy Irons who I will say seems to enjoy these kinds of cheesy things, at least he's having fun making his big paycheck and probably knows it's crap.<br /><br />And here comes the best/worst part: after dispatching the leader by moving his machine forward in time while super-Morlock is hanging on outside of the machine's \\"sphere of safety\\" (my words, none of this is ever explained) and aging the Morlock to death in a few seconds, the time traveler comes back, frees Mara, and sets the machine to blow up, which it quickly does, turning all of the Morlocks underground to dust just as the protagonists reach the surface and safety. So, uh, he saves the day by basically blowing up his machine despite not, uh, really possibly knowing what the consequences would be. This, like virtually the whole of the rest of the film, is just thrown at us with no explanation, and now our hero is presumably left to start a new world with the (of course) beautiful and intelligent Mara, having in a few days forgotten all about his past.<br /><br />Pearce is awful, looking like an ugly sad puppy through most of the film and never being remotely convincing as a man of science; Mumba is nice to look at but that's about it. Some of the art direction and sets are kind of cool, but in a very self-conscious way: look, isn't this awesome! Like the Eloi village, a bunch of weird shell-shaped structures on a cliff face that really don't seem feasible or likely. Not that much of anything in the film as a whole seems feasible or likely, for that matter. It's just, rush ahead, and hope nobody notices how stupid it all is.

B002EE583O|4.0|Two discs-59 and 64 minutes each approximately.  There is a DVD included with this set,consisting of live footage from 1989 and six videos of a number of the tracks from the original album.  The packaging is nice-a quadruple-fold out,with the three discs snapped in plastic keepers.  The booklet has a number of good color photographs of the band members.  There are also several pages on the band and its music by Ian Brown and Gary \\"Mani\\" Mounfield,plus an overview by John Robb.  On my copy of their first album from a number of years ago,there's a finished track,\\"Elephant Stone\\",that's not listed on this current release,except in different form as a demo.  This,and other singles/early tracks can be found on other releases such as \\"The Complete Stone Roses\\" album,although a number of tracks are shortened in length.  Another fine collection is \\"Turns Into Stone\\",which contains fewer tracks but they are full length.  A lot of other tracks are also on the limited edition box set,which contains (among a lot of other stuff) another disc of tracks.  Likewise,on the current release,\\"Fools Gold\\" is listed on the back of the package,but not on the inside,under the disc,with the other tracks.  There is also a \\"surprise\\" at the end of the demo disc.  Fifteen tracks are listed,but the CD player lists twenty.  There's nothing until track twenty-enjoy!<br /><br />The original album is considered to be one of the best albums of all time ( in Britain) by a number of critics and fans.  And for good reason.  It came out at just the right time.  A combination of bits of acid house,punk,pop,and a bit of psychedelia mixed together-it was the perfect sound for the times.  The band was influenced by another group,XTC,under the guise,THE DUKES OF STRATOSPHEAR,and their perfect re-creation/homage to sixties psychedelic/pop music,and it shows.  The songs \\"The Waterfall\\",and \\"Don't Stop\\",are perfect examples of THE STONE ROSES  style.  The first track has a mixture of acid house feel,sixties style psychedelic guitar,suitably trippy (\\"shes a waterfall\\") lyrics,with a pop music sound.  The latter song takes the psychedelic guitar/vocal sound even further to great effect. After a few changes in personnel,the band settled on Ian Brown-vocals,John Squire-guitar,Gary Mounfield-bass,and Alan \\"Reni\\" Wren-drums and backing vocals.  But one of the best things the band did was hire the fine producer (BEATLES,John Lennon,George Harrison,etc.) John Leckie.  He took the band's somewhat retro sound and up-dated their music and produced a huge,euphoric,somewhat spacey sound that fit the times perfectly.<br /><br />By now most people have heard the band's first (and best) album.  While the sound of the original release was good,this addition is just a bit cleaner,crisper.  There is an immediacy to the vocals,which are up front,along with that great guitar sound,that helped define this band.  Both the bass and the drums are a bit cleaner in this new version,and add greatly to the band's sound.  Overall,this new version only intensifies the band's sound.  But what this album has going for it is a certain,undefinable \\"something\\".  Everything seems to bend and flow together into a sound that's quite arresting and powerful.  From the first track,\\"I Wanna Be Adored\\",into \\"She Bangs The Drums\\",through to \\"I Am The Ressurection\\",this album doesn't let up in its appeal.  The \\"bonus\\" track,\\"Fools Gold\\",is a bit confusing to me,as its on my original  copy of the album,in all its full length glory.  Possibly it wasn't on the original British release or subsequent releases of the album.  For those who don't own this song,its a welcome addition-fitting in seamlessly with the rest of the tracks.  Twenty years on,the power and intensity of this album lives on,which is proof of its timelessness and appeal.<br /><br />The second disc of \\"lost demos\\" is not a collection of throwaways.  While lacking the power of the finished tracks (naturally),these demos give a deeper view into the band andLeckie's production.  Are they truly worthwhile?  Yes.  Besides giving a look into the first album's finished sound,a number of tracks are enjoyable on their own merit.  Besides demos of several of the original album tracks,there's a number of songs that were tried out,that didn't make it onto the first album.  The sound on these demos is far better than the bands first demos,heard on \\"Garage Flower\\".  Examples like \\"Going Down\\" has an almost early r&r feel to it.  \\"Something's Burning\\",a low key combination of pop and psychedelia,has the feel of the original album's sound,and would fit in seamlessly.  \\"One Love\\" has that STONE ROSES guitar sound,with the rhythm section wrapped around it,which is one of the high points of these demos.<br /><br />For those familiar with this record,this is a good buy,with worthwhile extra tracks and good sound.  For those unfamiliar with this band,give some of these tracks a listen-you,too,will be captivated,and wonder how something this good slipped by you unnoticed.Are they truly worthwhile?  Yes.

1400023343|3.0|I have one major warning for people considering purchasing this book, if you are monolingual STAY AWAY!  The author claims that even parents who can't speak a foreign language can find loads of great advice for raising their children to become bilingual - this just isn't the case.  If you or your spouse can speak your child's target language then you have found a decent book (although really most of the advice is simply \\"speak to your child in the minority language\\").  If you cannot speak enough of whichever language you want to have your child learn, this book is less than useless.
1416550542|5.0|I just finished \\"The Forgotten Garden\\".  Wow!  It deserves five stars!  I enjoyed it better than the author's first book.  Garden is a little long, but it needs to be this lengthy to \\"flesh out\\" the many interesting characters and the detailed storylines.  I could not put it down.  If you love this book, try \\"The Grange House\\".  I can't wait for Morton's third book.
0156029065|3.0|This was the first (and so far only) work of Umberto Eco I have read and it ultimately lost my interest.  I am loath to put a book down without finishing it, but this was a rare exception for me.  I really enjoyed the story when it focused on the growth of the Italian city-states and when Eco focused our attention on the emergent Alessandria, but as the story continued and Eco left this behind to delve into the quest for the Holy Grail and the Kingdom of Prester John the book just lost my interest.  It's well written and the characters are well developed, the plot was just too scattered across theology, mythology, the Sack of Constantinople, and the Italian city-states for my taste.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Amazing; The way Jodi Picoult writes so deeply into the identities of her characters and the story itself made it hard to put the book down.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Ignore the hype in the popular press about this movie being some kind of  \\"epic battle between good and evil\\".  It's nothing more than an action/car chase movie centered around a lunatic serial killer.  It's my least favorite of ALL the Batman movies.  The screenplay is a mess, the photography is mediocre, and the DVD is grainy and badly transferred.  Heath Ledger didn't deserve an Oscar for this role, he obviously won it via the sympathy vote.  He deserved the Oscar for \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"!  I find it disturbing that the masses today make heroes out of psychopaths and find them funny or amusing.  At least Hitchcock made his movies (including \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Frenzy\\") with grace, style, intelligence and coherent scripts.  The ending of this movie is one of the worst in film history - it abruptly stopped, like they ran out of film.  It left far too much unresolved - plus it pinned the blame on the only true hero in the movie!  It shows a warped sense of morality - and a very cynical view of the world!  \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Watchmen\\" are both far superior movies AND are much more entertaining.  Don't waste your time and money on this overrated nightmare!
B001N26GFM|3.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas,\\" set during WWII, begins with a 9-year-old boy Bruno playing with his friends in the street of Berlin. Bruno's father is a German military officer and one day because of his father's \\"job,\\" Bruno and his family move from the city to a home in a countryside, where Bruno finds a \\"farm\\" behind the forest. There, behind the fences of the \\"farm,\\" Bruno meets a boy named Shmuel and befriends this \\"boy in the striped pyjamas.\\"    We know this \\"farm\\" is really a Nazi Germany's concentration camp, but Bruno doesn't. You can say \\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas,\\" based on a 2006 bestselling novel by John Boyne, is about Holocaust seen from a German boy. And he is not just a boy; he is a son of the officer who is in charge of the concentration camp. For Bruno, a Nazi's propaganda film showing the inside of the concentration camp IS the truth.     No one can deny the impact of the film's devastating climax, but the story up to the point, especially the part about the two boys, look forced and artificial. To their credits the young actors did a very good job, but to believe their friendship and its tragic consequences, we also have to believe that a prisoner like Shmuel is allowed to roam in the concentration camp (with no guards around the fences). I know the film is based on a novel, but even so, I find some of the premises of the film (besides the English-speaking cast playing Germans) hard to swallow.     David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga are fine as Bruno's parents and Benoît Delhomme's photography with muted colors is a plus for the film, which is emotionally stunning, but not perfectly convincing.

0385504225|1.0|Dan has now decided that if he just plugs a few facts into his now perfected boiler plate plot scheme he has a new best seller....and of course he is right! Trouble is he forgot that this book was supposed to hold some new perspectives or gravitas about i)Solomon's Key and/or ii) a lost symbol?If Freemasonry began in 1717 what does this have to do with Egyptian pyramids or Solomon's Temple?    On the latter the book clearly does NOT deliver--unlike the Da Vinci Code in spades? Dan ends up being an apologist for every slight or criticism, true or false, hurled against the Freemasons--the worlds largest secret society.  He really stumbles at the conclusion picking the sun symbol for the lost symbol--the only thing that is lost is the reason Dan wrote this book? [no controversy = no content] So what took 6 years?  There is no shortage of fascinating personalities and history of masons like Gen Albert Pike, FDR, and Brother George Washington--so why include childish puzzles about the dollar bill and whatever the 8x8 zodiac square was supposed to represent? duh?  You can find those on the WWW/hello Tom Hanks!

But every time I watch, I feel empty, a little sad 'cause it's finished. In the case of this dvd is better because we have a book who explains the autors ideas for the next episodes (if their existed) and a great bonus dvd with enterviews with lots of the caracters and we can miss less the show.    I don't know if you understood me but I just can say that I really love this show and I miss it very much. If you like a really good drama, very real, watch it and you'll love it too.

B000VSBX34|1.0|I'm a big Beatles fan and I saw Help in the theaters when it was first released. I don't remember my reaction to it much, but I'm sure I loved it since it was such a thrill to see the Beatles in any circumstance.  Of course, the music was great, even though it was lip-synched. I rented Help recently and I have to tell you, I couldn't even finish watching it. It's a horrible movie. The attempts at humor fall flat and the Beatle just seem too old to be acting like such immature goofballs. Do yourself a favor, keep your childhood memories, watching this will only ruin them for you.
1572704756|1.0|Though I think that David Suchet does well in his portrayal of Hercule Poirot in the TV show, he does an abominable job as the narrator of Death on the Nile. The voices with which he chose to endow some of the characters were ridiculous and ill-fitting. In particular, Colonel Race comes off sounding like a doofus with a speech impediment, which does not describe him at all. You'd think that Suchet or at least one other person had read The Man in the Brown Suit or Cards on the Table and gotten some idea of Race's character--and therefore what he might sound like when he spoke. Yeesh.
B002HJBK7E|3.0|A compelling story, but too long. The novel was well-plotted. It hooked me with the characters and story line that became more and more horrific as it continued.<br />However, the prose was flabby. It needed paring. As I read, I kept asking myself where was the editor? A large portion of the early investigation was banal repetition of the same family lore. The author tried to be au courant by inserting brand names and technologies. But computer equipment should be described for what it does (briefly), not just laboriously named. The long section of emails and replies added nothing to the narrative. Larsson is not a modern day Jane Austen, using email correspondence to further plot or character development. Honestly, I couldn't figure out why this long section was in the book.<br />This novel was born of an excellent idea, but the presentation needed serious expunging of flab.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|The album starts off with Uprising. It's a great song. The best song on the whole album. I loved Absolution and Black Holes & Revelations but this album just doesn't sound at all like the other two. If you're a superfan, you might like this but if you casually listen to Muse, you probably wont like this album. I consider myself on the border of superfan but in my opinion this album just isn't their greatest work, in fact, I think it's their worst.
B0024RID60|2.0|I gotta roll with K Stephenson on this one. The 2009 remaster of this 1978 masterpiece makes my ears bleed. I happen to own a pretty decent rig that is very detailed, so for those folks listening through mushier sounding systems, or through tubes this may not b the case. The problem I'm finding with alot of these remasters is that they're boosted in the upper midrange (1 kHz - 2kHz) and are way too hot. In my setup on this version the notes in this range jump out from the mix and are piercing. The jangly guitar lines in Just My Imagination, and Miss You render the mixes unlistenable. I dunno, I'm not sure what's needed to reverse this trend in music remastering of retooling everything so damn hot. Maybe more young women in the studio with better hearing, esp in the mid to upper frequencies, to call attention to the aural offenses. Either that, or just let Steve Hoffman remaster everything. I think the industry needs to get away from having these burned out, 60 yo tin ears reworking the classics. Save your money on this one, or just get the earlier versions.
0394826817|5.0|Back in the 1970s, when I was a kid, I owned this one in my book collection at the time. Looking back on this book, it brought me smiles in remembering on learning good manners, how to be helpful, etc.  I am glad to see this still in print, and it is a great teaching tool for kids.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a repeat of Brown's other books.  I enjoyed The Da Vinci code and Angels and Demons so I made the mistake of pre-ordering this on my Kindle so I could read it immediately on publication.  I now wish I had put my money into a far better book - virtually any book would do - I ended up speed reading the final third of the book just to get it over with.  The introduction of Noetics I found particularly out of place - and it will only stimulate renewed interest in Third Ageism based on readers assuming that everything written here is true, like many did with The Da Vinci code.  I hope that people will realise this is a work of fiction and not quote the ideas in here as absolute fact.  If this had been published under another name, I would have assumed it was one of the plethora of derivatives which followed Brown's other books.  Perhaps after the professional reviewers/critics are finished with it, he may wish he had used a pseudonym.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The problems with AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, the documentary about Al Gore's long winded lectures on global warming, start with the title. The film would have more aptly been titled A VERY CONVENIENT THEORY. Parroting the conventional wisdom is anything but inconvenient, and, no matter how religiously you present your vision, a theory is not the same thing as a fundamental truth.<br /><br />As Gore drones on and on, promising gloom and doom if we don't believe him and do what he says, it is easy be seduced by his pictures of disasters and his ominous graphs. Since he has no doubt about his scary theories of climate change, we aren't encouraged to think either. We are lulled into a sense of impending and certain cataclysmic change, with the oceans about to drown us all.<br /><br />This propaganda piece is slick -- it is directed by Davis Guggenheim, who directed the \\"Uncertainty\\" episode of NUMB3RS, a television drama that tries to convince viewers that math can predict absolutely anything. AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH's purpose appears to be as much about bolstering Al Gore's presidential prospects as it is about seriously examining climate change. From watching hanging chads to visits to Gore's boyhood home to sad stories about his family's tragedies, the movie has everything that any campaign video would want.<br /><br />But, let's be honest, the \\"sky is falling\\" always sells, both books and politicians. Looking at only the past century, we have had warnings every decade that oil was about to run out in the following decade, but the proven reserves stubbornly just keep going up rather than being exhausted as predicted. In the middle of the last century, it was the so-called \\"population bomb,\\" which was predicted to soon cause widespread famine. And, most germane of all, the media in the early 1970s was full of dire predictions by \\"all of the experts\\" that we were entering the next ice age and that mankind was responsible. Contrast this with today, when the media is just as full of predictions that the opposite is about to occur. The only constant is that \\"we\\" are still to blame, so we are told that we have to fix it.<br /><br />Gore claims that the scientists' elaborate computer models predict that absolute disaster is coming and is already underway. What he doesn't remind you is that your local meteorologist can't even predict whether it will rain tomorrow with much accuracy. Yet, we are supposed to believe that these models, which once predicted global cooling and are now predicting global warming, are to be taken as gospel. Remember Long Term Capital Management? They hired some of the smartest Ph.D.s in the entire world in order to build a super-sophisticated stock market model. In the end, it proved to be an abysmal failure, with its collapse rippling through the world's financial markets. Models that attempt to predict the world's long-term climate are a pipe dream, with accuracy parameters so low as to be nearly useless.<br /><br />The shapes and directions of many of the graphs that Gore produces as facts are in dispute, and on some of them, the root cause of the graph's direction is anything but conclusively known. Sometimes, he widely labels things as being a consensus, which they aren't, and, at other times, he misstates the consensus. He says, for example, that the experts predict that global temperatures will rise a minimum -- a \\"minimum,\\" he repeats -- of five degrees, whereas most reports have scientists predicting an average of a modest one degree rise over the next hundred years -- an amount very close to the error variations in the data.<br /><br />As another example, Gore produces a graph showing that Japanese car companies are much more profitable than American ones. He attributes this solely to American auto companies refusing to make the fuel efficient cars we really want. With many \\"American\\" cars containing more foreign parts than \\"foreign\\" cars, which are increasingly made right here in America, the most obviousdifference is that Japanese car companies are in right-to-work states which don't require union membership as a precondition for employment. What the graph really shows then is mainly the cost of union labor, not some sinister plot by American car companies to force their customers to buy gas guzzlers.<br /><br />Professor Richard Lindzen, the head of atmospheric studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of many scientists who don't believe in the religion of global warming, as preached by Gore and others. Professor Lindzen acknowledges that there has been some warming in the past few decades, just as the period of 1940-1970 featured cooling temperatures worldwide. What isn't clear, as Professor Lindzen has pointed out, is to what extent man has been the cause, and whether we can do much to change the temperature in the future.<br /><br />Moreover, it isn't clear that slightly warmer temperatures are bad. Some studies have suggested that it would produce a longer growing season, thus being a net plus for the planet. Of course, none of these opposing theories are presented in Al Gore's documentary, other than the times he ridicules those who disagree with him with a mocking tone, suggesting that they must be idiots.<br /><br />Others have argued that, even if we aren't sure whether man is the cause or not, we should immediately take action. Gore keeps pressing the point that fighting global warming isn't a political issue but a \\"moral imperative.\\"<br /><br />Taking the wrong action, even for the best of intentions, can be worse than inaction. We banned DDT in order to attempt to save some animals and have killed millions of humans in Africa due to malaria, an inconvenient truth that African leaders keep trying to impress upon western do-gooders.<br /><br />\\"What gets us in trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so,\\" Mark Twain told us. Gore uses this quote early on in the film. Although Gore thinks it applies to those who disagree with his theories. The most obvious application of Twain's quote is to the global warming zealots who believe in their theory with unquestioning and religious intensity.n right-to-work states which don't require union membership as a precondition for employment.

0763631205|5.0|Beautiful edition, excellent quality.  The paper is high-quality and semi-gloss, the illustrations are particularly suggestive. The book also smell good, which - in my opinion - is a major plus.  I bought this book for my daughter when she was only 2 years old, I am currently keeping it well preserved from dust, and plan to give it to her in the future... when she'll be old enough to appreciate the message of this beautiful novel.
0307450570|3.0|I wanted this book so badly even after reading a few reviews that said it wasn't that great. I want to say that I love Martha Stewart and her magazines, but I wasn't that impressed with the craft ideas in this book.   There were a few projects that involved sea shells, which are way out-dated for my taste, some crafts that involved glitter, which I've always thought was common sense, a section on beading, which peaked my interest, but not enough to run out and purchase the necessary supplies, a section on botanical pressing...another that is out-dated for my taste, and so on.    I saw where another woman reviewed this poorly because there was no section on sewing, which is true. There is only one project that involves any sewing and that is the one where you make a tiny acorn with a real acorn top and a fabric bottom. You may sew an inch by hand and that's it.    The projects I found interesting were the glass etching project, which I've successfully completed. I was a little disappointed that you can find this on her website with the same exact photos and all, and it's FREE there! I found the stamping projects, and screen printing projects very interesting and I may attempt those as well. The stamping section sparked some interest as well and I'm probably going to give it a whirl too.     My advice is to look at this book in a library or book store before you purchase it! Then, if you are still interested, purchase the book from here, of course. Also, check her website for the crafts featured in the book. I think they are all there with similar if not the same photos...and once again, they are FREE there. I hope this helps=)
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Okay I just got to tell you that this is the most absolutely beautiful Christmas album I have ever heard.  I love<br />Christmas alot but regular Christmas Music can get a little 'jingly' sometimes; but the songs Sara did on this album<br />just blew me away, think of phrases like 'hauntingly beautiful', 'extraordinary vocal range', 'refreshingly fresh'.<br />Got the cd about a month ago and been listening to it alot since so its definately the Christmas<br />music thats cool to play any time of year and I like that.
B00000G5WJ|5.0|Now that the redone Fame movie is being released this month, I have taken a trip down memory lane and one of my most watched TV shows: Fame.  My favorite song on this soundtrack is \\"Desdamona\\" even though the lead singer (character Danny) is featured in it and he doesn't have the strongest voice.  I am SO buying this on CD!!!
B000002UTT|5.0|I have 2 quick reviews. The first one is that I love this music from the 80's. Its more about the memory of being a kid. I was age 3-13 in that decade. Roxette makes me think of this girl on my school bus. AND NOW for the second part: If I were a little bit older like in highschool or college when Roxette was popular then I would of hated it for what it actually is, total corny, thrown together, MTV, corporate garbage. Its terrible, and I can be the first to admit that its not good. And thats why the title of this review is called \\"I Don't Care\\" because I don't care what people think!
B001FB55YE|4.0|It was a very good interesting movie, if you liked Snatch you would probably like this one.  I thought there might be a little bit more shooting in it, but otherwise it was entertaining.
0385504225|3.0|The main plot of the story is standard Dan Brown stuff and you can buy it or reject it as you'd like.  It certainly makes for riveting reading as you follow the twists and turns of the story.  However, it's surprising that nobody has mentioned the major subplot of the novel:  the involvement of the CIA.   I won't spoil it for anybody, but it is rather ridiculous.   A matter of national security?  That much suspension of disbelief is pretty hard to accomplish!
B000XA5K4I|5.0|There is tons of action and shooting in this movie hence the title.  Also lot of comedy parts too, if you like action with no dull moments then watch this movie.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|OUTLANDER is one of those movies I'd never heard of. It's a sci-fi / fantasy / monster movie loaded w/ sword-clanking battle-action and heroics. Jim Caviezel (Unknown) plays Kainan, an extraterrestrial who crash-lands on earth during the iron age. He finds himself in the middle of a war between two viking tribes. This is the least of his (or anyone else's) worries, as a seemingly unstoppable beast has also arrived, and is wiping out entire villages. Kainan must unite the vikings in order to destroy the cunning, insatiable creature. The fact that so few people have seen OUTLANDER is a mystery and a crime! John Hurt (Alien, 1984, Hellboy) and Sophia Miles (Underworld) co-star, along w/ Ron Perlman (Alien Resurrection, The Last Winter, Hellboy 1 and 2) as a warhammer-wielding, viking warrior! Buy immediately...
B001W63DX2|4.0|It was interesting to see all that goes into making a marathon 45-day tour.  I'd also bet Bruce is just about the only lead singer who can also pilot a jumbo jet.    I rented the DVD.  It's worth one viewing, but it's not something I'd want to buy and keep.  And I'm saying this as someone who's been a huge Maiden fan for the last 23 years and also a fan of Dickinson's solo work.    I was disappointed by the relatively limited concert performance, though you can find that on other DVDs.    It was great to see these \\"old\\" guys introducing their music to a new generation.  Many of those in the crowds were teens & college age and they're chanting for a band where the youngest member (Dickinson) is 51-years-old and is playing songs that were written before many of these fans were born.    This was their Back In Time tour so they only played their old 1980s work, which I guess would attract a younger fan base since people like me would prefer to hear newer songs in addition to stuff I first heard in the mid-1980s.
B001QB9H10|2.0|If you like an action movie and you're not too critical of the story, or the acting, give this a shot.  But buy it cheap (definitely under $10), or, better yet, rent it.  You're not likely to watch it again.
B00005KHJR|3.0|First- watch the extended version even though the added scenes werent remastered and are poor picture quality. Here it goes- the Wicker Man is a well-thought out and finely cast picture that falls between horror and psychological mystery. Christopher Lee is great as is the actor portraying Howie, the policeman who's curiosity eventually leads him to a horror he couldnt have imagined even though i saw it coming. A big plus must be given to the soundtrack which is one of the best youll ever hear(a mix of celtic folk and eerie instrumentals) costumes and the plot but where the film falls short in my eye is the lack of background on the islands pagan rituals- it briefly explained but not enough to back the story.  Sensuality and simplicity transforms into lunacy and murder without any realistic reasoning. Its very vague and also the prochristian counter message of the lead is a bit annoying. Wicker Man is a good Sunday movie - slow but keeps you interested and though i feel its worth seeing , it is by no means the classic its been made out to be. Rent it or get it cheap( i found mine at a garage sale for 4$ ). As a bonus theres some great camera shots- some shapely nude women and nice scenery. On a grading scale id give this a B- and it is a step above the recent remake starring Nicholas Cage.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|It took me a while to get used to this version. I expected to be blown away with the sound as I was when I first heard Beatles Love. While I'm not sure exactly of how the project was handled, here is my synopsis. It quickly became apparent to me that these new remasters are just that. A remaster of the existing master tapes. They added more bottom end and clarity without the digital harshness of the previous CD releases. In Love they 'remixed' and 'remastered' the songs thus a much better sound. In a remix, they can adust each track separately and re-arrange it in the mix to make it more effective than was originally done. Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick provides details of how the original tracks were mixed in his book. I would imagine that remixing was not done due to the fact that many die-hard fans would resist hearing it mixed differently. They wanted to keep it somewhat historically correct. That's why a mono version of the original masters was also released. For the sake of the purists. I've read that the Beatles themselves preferred the mono versions. In the recent Capital records mono releases that I've purchased, I much prefer stereo.  A total remix would have been welcomed by me, and I'm sure a much more massive undertaking. Don't be suprised if there are remixes (not remasters) like Love released in later years, where they may i.e., take a previously right panned vocal and put it upfront and center in the mix and pan the background vocals right and left.    In this Past Masters there a bright spots. Much more bass. I was disappointed with the muddy mix of 'She loves you' (which is panned mostly right and sounds mono), but quite impressed with the awesome version of 'this boy' and 'I call your name'. Naturally the newer the song the better the sound. 'Don't let me down', ' Get Back' are special treats. I have most of the Beatles LPs and most of the CDs. I think the remasters are good enough that I'll replace my CD collection with the remastered versions. The remasters are much warmer and in your face.  If you have never heard many of the tracks on Past Mastered, you are in for a treat.
0143034901|4.0|It's impossible to read Shadow of the Wind without being reminded of other books and authors:  A.S. Byatt's Possessions, Dickens' Great Expectation, Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Isabel Allende's The House of Spirits, and Stephen King's horror books come to mind. It is obvious that the author, Carlos Ruiz Zafon, is an avid lover of literature, and that's reflected in much of his evocative prose.<br /><br />The book starts with a highly original concept:  a young boy named Daniel accompanies his father to a mysterious Barcelona library called The Cemetery of Lost Books.  The author writes, \\"According to tradition, the first time someone visits this place, he must choose a book whichever he wants, and adopt it, and make sure that it will never disappear and that it will always stay alive.\\" The remainder of the book details how Daniel feels compelled to honor that promise, as he becomes more and more obsessed with the book and the mysterious and quixotic author -- Julian Carax -- behind it.  His quest becomes more complicated when he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book Carax has written...and his book is being targeted as well.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Zuin is a masterful writer.  His turn of phrase and ability to uncover universal truths with just a few well-chosen words is astounding.  The book straddles a number of genres; the coming-of-age of a young boy mourning his mother's death; a tragic Victorian-type romance; a detective/adventure story as Daniel and his sidekick Fermin attempt to unveil the mysteries of the book; a hair-raising gothic horror story. The theme of the book --\\"that a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us\\" -- resonates strongly with anyone who loves a good read.<br /><br />Then why not five stars?  To this reader, the last quarter of the book was far more Stephen King than it was, say, A.S. Byatt.  (Caveat: I believe Stephen King is an underrated writer;  he is certainly a master of his genre.  My point here is that the tone of the book shifts perceivably.) Zuin seems to back away from his very original premise.  Instead, he embraces very dark hairpin turns and gothic elements that gradually veer from magical fantasy into outright unbelievability, with a strong focus on murder and madness. At least one of the key characters doesn't seem true to his past depiction.<br /><br />That being said, Shadow of the Wind is a welcome addition for some readers who crave old-fashioned storytelling and supernatural plots.certainly a master of his genre.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Anyone under the age 38 really can't do them justice as they didn't get the Beatles onto their collective psychic. The Beatles were without exception (yes, Elvis, The Rolling Stone and anyone you can think of) THE best band on the Planet,solar system and beyond. It's just tragic a bone head had to go and kill one of them early and screw up the foursomes ability to possibly get back together for a concert or two. The music was for the most part exquisite in its form. the chording, the melody line were exquisite. the Beatles changed the face and collective sound of the music. I for one am so glad we can preserve their heritage. They were wonderful.
1595141715|5.0|I came across this book because someone on a message board I frequent mentioned that he had taken it away from his daughter until he could read it and decide if he'd allow her to read it. After coming here and seeing what the book was about, I decided that I had to read it. And I'm glad I did. It is excellent. I had a hard time putting it down too.     There's a lot of focus on the suicide aspect of the story, and that's important, but the thing that struck me the most though was the way that it all revolved around something many consider to be not a big deal or a small sin - gossip. It started with the gossip about her chastity, or supposed lack thereof and from there swirled and swirled and eventually escalated to suicide. Ironically, gossip is also what kept Clay from reaching out to her more and asking her out, which may have saved her life. He had heard the gossip and he was afraid of finding out it was true and so he didn't act. I thought it made for a very powerful example of the immense harm gossip, and also teasing and ridicule, can do to someone. They aren't harmless sins, but are often the most tolerated and encouraged by society. And just because you can't see the effect it has doesn't mean it isn't there. I hope the people that read this, especially teens, will come away more mindful of their words and actions.     I think the comparison to Go Ask Alice is right on and I hope this book will be used to open up conversations about suicide, teasing, gossip, sex, drinking etc. the way Go Ask Alice opened up conversation about drugs and put on school reading lists as Go Ask Alice is. I think this book would be a great way for parents to open a dialog with their teenagers in a way that gets the teenager interested and engaged instead of feeling lectured to and bored.      This is a great book and I hope parents, teachers and teens alike all read it.
1595141715|5.0|Literally I had to go to class the next day (which lasted from 8am to 10pm), or rather a few hours later, running on 3 hours of sleep.  This book is an easy read and before I knew it I was enthralled in the story that NEEDED to be told.  There is a sense of urgency that captivated me in continuing to read.  Maybe it was they way I imagined Hannah Baker's voice, her sarcastic (at times) and yet pained voice flowing from a static filled tape or maybe it was the sense of sympathy I felt for Clay, a boy who deeply liked a girl he'll never grow to love.  This story though written in \\"plain\\" language has the ability to pull a reader into a world of innocent lies and deceptions and minor failures that ends up being the biggest failures of all time.  It has a valuable lesson, not to be learned as I believe every person in the world knows of it, but rather not to be ignored or push aside.
0385504225|5.0|I have been waiting for Dan Brown's next book and found the book to be worthy of the wait. The book is so well written and researched, as all his previous books. I found myself checking out the images on the internet. I even called the telephone number and got Peter Solomon's voice mail!! It was a great read. I am sure there will be Washington DC -Lost symbol tours offered soon!!!

0385341008|4.0|As a 10 year member to a bookclub that we call The Ya Ya's, we all read the same book and then meet to discuss that book. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is also about a bookclub that is formed because of the occupation that took place on their island back in the 40's. The majority of the readers in our bookclub really enjoyed this book as it was written in a unique style; with each page a letter going from one person to another. We felt that you were able to get to know that character from a personal point of view. There were a few in our bookclub that did not enjoy this style of writing as they felt it was confusing to follow along with the story. The most important point of our discussion was about the occupation and how detailed that was and we really learned alot of historical information from the story. We gave this book 4 stars as it was a good read.<br /><br />  Gayle Kellett
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This truly is an essential collection, especially if you're looking for something that encompasses Jackson's entire career.  Having the hits from the Jackson 5 era is what makes it special.  Sure there are a few songs that some of the other reviewers feel should have been included in place of others.  But that's the nature of any collection.  You can't please all of the people all of the time. If you're looking to buy just one set to remember the King of Pop by, this is the one!
B00000APLB|5.0|I have been waiting since I was 15 to have this and it is every thing I expected it would be, but then again it is the greatest rock band in the world
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this actress. I wish she was in more stuff. I had to watch a scene several times, because I loved it so much. If you like Jane Austen movies like the old Pride and Prejudice (with Colin Firth), you will definitely like this Bronte movie. The only thing I can say is that some parts come off weirder than they are, but stick through it, it will all come together in the end:)
B002FOQXZK|5.0|Just copped the album, and I gotta say its everything I expected it to be and more.  Its way over due but its here and Kid Cudi is here to stay.  I hope he wins awards and goes platinum in two weeks.  Anyone who's not \\"Rap Only\\" listeners will appreciate this album so much cause he mixes it up between many genres and makes loving tracks with out of this world beats. Man on the moon sho be right for dat title. Go cop dis album and dat new KRS1 too!
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|First of all let me get this out of the way. J. Johnson's review is bogus. Or else the reviewer is pure nuts! I knew of the remastered release of the Beatles CD's for awhile. And having spent huge amounts of money over the years on remastered CD's of other artists, and being very happy with some and dissapointed with others.I was a little weary about picking up another. But being in a Starbuck's in Rancho Mirage CA, I was staring down at The Beatles Abby Road remastered and thinking ....hummm, Should I get this. Well I did. Went home and placed it in my system and was speechless. I have never heard the Beatles sound so rich and flawless. The sound was perfect , mix was A+++++++. The bottom was excellent. With punch.The highs are unreal. The strings tugging at your heart.You know the music. Now really get into it. I would tell anyone to get this CD and without listening to the others. I would go as far to say Buy, buy, buy. I will. I would have gotten Sgt. Peppers but they had sold out. But I will. You know, just put on the old CD, and then put on the remastered and you will hear a whole new audio experence.Savor and enjoy the new Beatles. Something old, But something new. But all in all it is SOMETHING!!!!!!!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This film goes so very far towards putting *fun* and humor and humanity and wonder back into the series.  Everything Abrams touches turns to gold.  The original trek was all about **adventure**.  Sure, I loved TNG like everybody else, but somewhere between Picard rhapsodizing about English drama and literature and Janeway's wearing wooden knickers all of Trek turned stale.  I'm not even sure if Riker had flexible knees -- that's how static and inflexible the acting and the action became.     I liked the original movies.  Except, somehow, everyone inovlved in them became batseething crazy.  Just, crazy. Did you see Star Trek V: The Final Frontier? What the hell was that about? Great -- Shatner wants to direct. They never let Mr. T direct on the A-Team. There's a lesson to be had there.    The TNG movies were also unpredictable. I liked the last one, but I've seen episodes of Webster that were more riveting than Insurrection. Webster in Spanish. On Betamax.     This movie is fun.  Short skirts are back -- and not on dudes. Stuff explodes. Space karate is had. And it's still smart and moving and meaningful.     And just think about how awesome its going to be now that all the introductions have been made.     If you're all sloshy and bothered by the new vision, please just consider that its all in an alternate timeline. If that doesn't work, well -- hmm.  Maybe Trek isn't for you anymore. Maybe you've just lost touch with quality pop culture. Maybe you don't remember Sulu running around with that sword.  Fencing, dude.  He's into fencing.    And that's your canon.
B002NXPTDK|3.0|This album is definitely not the same old, same old mainstream hip hop and definitely worth a listen. The production on this album is really nice. The beats stand out and the lyrical content is interesting. However Kid Cudi's vocals where underwhelming for me. The whole time I found myself wishing it was someone else I was listening to. I would characterize his style as somewhere in between rapping and singing and except on choruses, it diminished my enjoyment of the album. Maybe over time his vocal style will grow on me or maybe I just don't like his voice.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Porcupine Tree has taken another step forward with \\"The Incident\\".  In a word it is brilliant.  The Incident really cannot be compared to PTree's previous releases other than to say that the band continues to keep the flame of excellence with each release.  Others can describe the substance of this masterpiece. There are cohesive themes which run throughout both the Incident disc and the second disc set.  Steve Wilson has written and orchestrated a stunning progressive opera of sound, gorgeous vocal nuances, spectacular guitar playing throughout and individual pieces which are simultaneously beautiful, harsh, unexpected and, yes, a delight to the ear.      Steve Wilson is a visionary who understands the joy that music lovers have enjoyed in the \\"album\\" concept.  The Incident exceeds all expectations on every level.  Musically, thematically, technically and execution wise, this is the real deal. The sound is layered with Richard Barbieri's spectacular paint brush stokes, the stellar drumming of Gavin Harrison and the always understated bass of Colin Edward.  But the star of the show is Wilson's guitar playing and vocals.  He has never sounded better on guitar. For someone who downplays his guitar playing, he has been schooled very well by the masters and takes everything he has learned and brings his own flair throughout the Incident.  His vocals are also incredible: layered and outright glorious. The production on the Incident is better than anything out there!    Porcupine Tree has produced another masterpiece.  Do we expect anything less?
B002FOQXZK|1.0|This is like a joke...right?     Everybody giving this 5 star reviews, you're being sarcastic, right?     I mean, you did actually listen to the album right?    Look, Kanye is an artist. Granted, he took some ideas that had already been planted by artists before him and took them to the next logical step, so while not completely original, the packaging was definitely original, and a smart response to the overabundance of fake gangsta braggadocio that still permeates hip-hop. He wasn't a \\"conscious\\" rapper, but he had conscious rhymes. He wasn't a gangsta rapper, but he talked about wanting to get rich, and when he got rich, he rapped about being rich. He also rapped about sex, he made us laugh. He went to college, and wasn't afraid to admit it. Most of all, Kanye admitted that while he could be incredibly arrogant, he could also be incredibly insecure, something most rappers wouldn't care to admit. It spoke to those of us who aren't, or who didn't sell drugs.     Kanye obviously made it possible for more variety in hip-hop today.(Though more work is needed in this regard) The Drakes, the Kid-Cudis', hell, even the kinder, gentler Jay-Z that you see today is the direct result of Kanye. And I applaud the growth of hip-hop in this regard.     But this album is quite simply...garbage.
B001NEJXQE|2.0|The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page, makes it difficult to read at points, definitely not worth the price for the effort the publisher put in.

1423113497|5.0|Percy discovers how and why he has powers when he's 11, similar to the kid-Wizard.  I love how they refer back to the old Greek mythology, and relate it to today.  Definitely a good series for kids.  My grandson recommended these books to me; we've been reading them at the same time. Encouraging kids to read is a good thing.
0385504225|2.0|I have enjoyed all Dan Brown's books, but less than halfway through The DaVinci Code, I began to notice he used the word \\"astonish\\" with all its suffixes -ed, -ing  -ment --ingly far too much.  Astonish is a strong word but used too often it dulls the shock value.  I wrote to his editor and pointed this out because if the author doesn't catch these things a good editor should.  So, a few months ago I pre-ordered The Lost Symbol.  When I got it, by golly, there was the first \\"astonishing\\" on page two of the prologue.  I decided to keep track.  I am now on page 51 and the word has already been used 5 times!  So, at once per every 10 pages, that should make about fifty times I will see it in his 500 plus pages.  Does he even read his ms. over?  Does his editor?  Doesn't he have enough money to invest in a good thesaurus?  I'll write again in a few days (after I finish it) and give you all the final tally.
0671646788|3.0|I found this book very interesting, it will certainly help anyone boost their confidence, avoid loosing faith in one's abilities and improve positive thinking. On page 295 in one of the paragraph it states that \\" Check the lives of the great religious leaders, and you'll find each of them spent considerable time alone. Moses frequently was alone, often for long periods of time. So were Jesus, Buddha, Conficus, Mohammed, Gandhi- every outstanding religious leader in history spent much time in solitude, away from the distractions of life\\"..... Mahatma Gandhi has never been a religious leader, a mistake to include Gandhi in the list of religious leaders. I request the author to correct this.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD has a great mix of best songs by The Beatles. I would call this a best buy in a sole CD from The Beatles.[[ASIN:B00004ZAV3 The Beatles 1]]
B0025KVLTM|4.0|Just got my copy of the 2009 remastered version of SPLHCB and iTuned it to my hard disk where the earlier version of SPLHCB also resides (yes, I used the same settings re bit rate, 320kbps). I can't hear any difference from the earlier version, except that the remaster is indeed noticeably louder. The packaging is nice, but the reason I wanted the new CD is the hope that it would sound better. The computer-only minidocumentary was boring; maybe someday I'll play it all the way through but not today.    If anyone can point out any portion of any of the songs that is objectively better in the remastered version, please let us all know. Otherwise, I'll simply consider the remastered versions a marketing ploy and not worth spending my $$ on...    I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars as I can't see any reason to spend extra money for a second copy of the CD. However, if you don't yet own SPLHCB, then the remastered version is the one to buy; if nothing else, for the extra artwork and for the minidocumentary video.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Oddly enough the BBC version features a more lavish production than this movie. Also, trying to condense the book into 2 hrs  cuts the characters into 2 dimesionals. This movie feels more like a stage production with the acting. Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench are the sole exceptions. Kiera Knightley does a good job but when compared to Jennifer Ehle - well no one compares to her acting. The Mr. Darcy in this movie looks incredible as does the handsome actor who plays Mr. Wickham yet even their acting is stiff though Darcy's gets better towards the middle half. This whole movie feels rushed - in a matter of 10 minutes we are introduced to Mr. Collins and then Mr. Wickham. We also only get one Bingley sister instead of 2.<br /><br />This could've been an incredible version but it was very disappointing. My sole gripe is not being as faithful to  the classic book as it should. I could overlook the acting and the sets if only this movie didn't cut and rearrange the book.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Ewan McGregor is Rodney Copperbottom, a young robot who wants to dreams of becoming a famous inventor. He moves to the big city, only to have his dreams crushed when he finds out his idol is no longer in control of his company and Ratchet (Greg Kinear), has taken control. Like many CGI animated movies this film deals with a new and exciting unseen world. The plot is unfortunately not as original or interesting as other computer animated adventures. It is also light on comedy, unlike it's predecessors. 'Robots' is much more childish, but still enjoyable. The characters are given sparse screen time, to the point where we do not get to know or really care about any of them. Other characters just seem boring, such as Rodney's love interest. The animation is hardly ever interesting, something that is becoming more and more difficult. It is a film where one action scene leads to the other, rather than fleshing out characters and relationships. It seems the film is scared of becoming boring itself. Only one scene really stands out and that is the exceptional domino scene, which then escalates into absurdity (which is OK for a family film). All the voice actors are well placed, fitting their characters very well, although as I mentioned before the characters don't really have much to do. Robin Williams isn't used to his full extent, with his ad lib never reaching the hilarious heights of 'Aladdin'. The films consequences are inevitable, you know where the film is headed, which may come as a relief to some younger viewers but it is predictable for the rest of us. Being a huge fan of Tom Waits it was great to hear one of his songs used to such brilliant effect. Compared to Blue Skies earlier animated 'Ice Age' this film seems like a poor sibling. It starts off promising with some very clever and funny set-ups such as the making of the baby. Overall we have a film with great potential but boils down to a regular family film that is enjoyable, but probably only worth the one watch.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is an awesome knife by Ethan Becker, available from KA-BAR.  Great for handling just about anything you could ask from a solid everyday carry survival knife, including batoning wood.  The edge that came on the blade was shaving sharp out of the box, the handle has one of the most comfortable I have come across, and the sheath is versatile yet durable.  I can't speak highly enough about this work-horse of a knife that feels incredibly rugged in your hand.    The pricing here on Amazon is about as good as I have been able to find- I think I paid maybe a dollar or two less for mine from another website.  Including shipping you should not spend more than $65 on this knife, which sets it even further apart as being an outstanding buy.  If you do some research, you will quickly find that comparable knives go for at least $200.    Get the Bk2, you will not be disappointed.
0802798225|4.0|The thing that actually attracted me to this book was the video amazon had. What can I say? It's just catchy and I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.<br /><br />By the category it falls under it is naturally in a high school setting. The story revolves around Alex Fuentes and Brittany Ellis. From the exterior they fall on two ends of the spectrum personality and environment wise. At least that's what how the story begins. They get partnered up in Chemistry class and neither are really happy about it. Brittany is seen as the typical blond rich girl while Alex is the Latino bad boy type. Brittany's life is supposedly perfect, perfect hair, cloths and money. She just has everything she ever needs or at least that's what everyone thinks. Alex on the other hand is seen as the bad gang boy who everyone from Brittany's crowd wants to avoid.<br /><br />Once they become partners they start learning things about each other and it's a lot of fun to see the characters unravel. Sometimes things seemed a little far-fetched but still were enjoyable. I love books with a bigger issue than just boy meets girl and this one delivered on that end. It dealt with how growing up in different environments (in this case north side vs south sides) can have different outcomes. It dealt with how hard it is to have full integration in school because people refuse to get over stereotypes sometimes. It also dealt with how we have the option to choose our own paths even if it's a difficult one.<br /><br />I was at the start of the story annoyed with the Spanish because I didn't understand it. It ended up growing on me though and was actually by the end something new and interesting. It also would have been wrong to not have the character speak his own language every once in a while. \\"Mamacita\\" was probably my favorite word, which he used to call Brittany from the start. There were also some plot holes that weren't explained, which left me wondering what was meant. But other than that the book was really well put together..
B0010K83U8|5.0|This is one of Maiden best albums, a classic!!! If your into metal then this is a must have.
0609610570|5.0|Amazing book by Charam and Bossidy. The main idea is: plan carefully but do not forget that if you don`t execute it, it will be a 49% complete bridge: it will have no use. Another important insight: planning is not a more 'noble' action than executing. Planners are not more important than executors. In my experience, they are slightly less: 49% of the job is plan and 51% is doing it.
B0002IQNAG|1.0|I had never seen this movie until now, but for years had heard that it was great.  I don't think I've ever seen a review less than 3 stars for this movie, and Roger Ebert, who is usually pretty rough on horror films, gave it a lot of praise.  Don't forget, he's the guy who along with his co-host the late Gene Siskel, devoted an hour long TV special to talking about how slasher films were undermining the moral character of America and were examples of cinema at it's worst.    Now that I've seen Dawn of the Dead I'm somewhat surprised.  It really is a terrible movie.  It's not scary, funny, disturbing or entertaining in any way.  It's just a big bore.  It has none of the elements that fans of horror films usually seem to go for: no good looking women, not much gore, not much comic relief, and not even any campy bad acting.  The acting is bad, but not in an amusing or entertaining way.  There are no known actors in this, and they have no acting talent at all.  They sound like they are just reading lines - no expression in their voices and body language is way off.  There's not even any nudity.      The gore and special effects are laughable.  The zombies are not even very gruesome-looking (some of the non-zombies are actually uglier) and the blood (what little there is of it) just looks like bright red paint.  This is just a total disaster in ever conceivable way.  It is not worth anyone's time to watch it.  I don't know how anyone who was involved in making this film ever had a career after this.  What I really don't get is why so many people like this movie so much.  This has had multiple DVD releases while so many other great horror movies have never even been released on VHS.      I'm just glad that I got this at my local library instead of buying or even renting it.  If I'd laid out any money at all to see this, I'd feel cheated.  It has to be one of the most overrated movies ever, even more than Titanic, The Exorcist, The French Connection, and Risky Business.  Ididn't like any of those movies very much, but this one makes them look like masterpieces.  It really is that awful.  Most of the slasher films Siskel and Ebert condemned, even the ones I thought weren't so great myself, are light years more entertaining than this.

0385504225|4.0|As I began reading this I couldn't help but notice the similarities between the Lost Symbol and National Treasure. As I continue, I felt like I was reading Gods or Monsters. Even yet, as I arrived towards the conclusion, I honestly felt like it had turned into the Secret (law of attraction). Though I feel this is not what many readers may have in mind if they are familiar with the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. It can hold its own, but I wish Dan Brown would have finished the Soloman Key, unless this is it with a title change. Then I wish he would have stuck with his usual style. If you are familiar with the Secret as well as Gods or Monsters then I believe you may enjoy this... Otherwise if you are reading this because you liked the Da Vinci Code, then I would recommend something else. This is overboard compared to saying that Jesus's bloodline has continued (as was the plot in the Da Vinci Code) and that is saying alot!    If you are reading this because you have likened 2012 with doomsday then get it! Keep in mind though that \\"2012\\" is NOT the first time the Mayan calendar has ended so it certainly won't be the last... henseforth any doomsday writings of 2012 just don't hold water even in the world of fantasy. It's just my opinion folks, it doesn't make me right.
B000G8P1VE|5.0|I give this movie as a \\"welcome to college\\" gift for all my nieces and nephews in the 2nd semester of their freshman year. It's the kind of movie you can watch once or twice a year and still enjoy......it's timeless in it's validity......can't say that about a lot of movies. If you take the time to learn more about the movie's cast and the filming the more you can appreciate the 1st of it's kind in this genre. If you don't own it.....buy it! If you own it......watch it tonight!
0385504225|5.0|This novel was everything I expected: an exciting, fast-paced, page turner with numerous plot twists.  It follows a writing pattern similar to Brown's other novels, and that's a good thing.  I absolutely love the writing style of his other novels, and expected his new book to follow a similar format. What would anyone else expect? Before The Lost Symbol was released, it was known that Robert Langdon was going to be the central character, and the storyline would revolve around codes, symbols etc.  These are obviously the types of topics that DB knows well, and is able to weave into a very captivating story....which he has done yet again.  Keep up the good work Dan!
0765356147|5.0|This is a great ending to a series.  These three books by Brandon Sanderson are incredibly impressive.
0385504225|4.0|If you read the DaVinci Code and if you enjoyed it, then you'll probably enjoy the Lost Symbol.  It is not literature, but then how much of popular fiction is?  Dan Brown is not a solid writer from a technical point of view, at least I don't believe he is, but then how many novels have I published?  Zilch!  But I do recognize good storytelling and that is where Dan Brown's talent lies.  Even Angel and Demons was a great story, though I get bored with his anti-Catholic point of view.  That being said, The Lost Symbol is a great story.<br /><br />Shifting from Rome to Washington D. C. Robert Langdon is on a quest to discover a hidden pyramid in the nation's capitol.  The idea that there is a secret link to Free Masonry given that so many of our founders were themselves Masons, is the bedrock on which the story is based.  With apparent Masonic symbols everywhere and with even the grid of the city forming Masonic symbols you can see how much fodder Dan Brown has.  This is not new material.  There has been at least one program of the television exploring this idea (TLC or the History Channel).<br /><br />Like another reviewer I have a credibility problem with a Harvard Professor engaged in some of the stunts Dr. Langdon is called upon to undergo.  I'm not sure I can continue to suspend believability that much. After a few chapters I also saw the similarity in the story to National Treasure.  I have to believe that this is a coincidence since all of Browns recent books are stamped with a similar imprint.  If anything, it is National Treasure cashing in on the DaVinci Code.<br /><br />The secret to Brown's success in The Lost Symbol is the twisty, turny way he spins his tale.  There's always something out there that is needed to solve the puzzle.  If it's not a symbol on a building, it is a person who holds some information that is needed.  These devices get old after a while, but they do string the reader along.  Eventually, you find yourself at the end of the story having followed the storyteller through the maze.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is not classic literature but it is a good dose of modern storytelling.  You could do worse in picking a book to read.<br /><br />I recommend.<br /><br />Peace to all.ler through the maze.    The Lost Symbol is not classic literature but it is a good dose of modern storytelling.  You could do worse in picking a book to read.    I recommend.    Peace to all.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Oh my god, has to be the first sentence. If you don't agree then you are wrong.  :)  This set sounds incredible, and I actually like how they didn't mess with the stereo orientation.  This is the godd@mn BEATLES, the undisputed best band of all time's catalogue you're speaking of, mind you.  Incredible job, restoration guys/gals, this sounds great.  Thanks for your work.  I haven't been happier in a purchase in a long time.  And I already own the 1987 versions.  This version sounds so much more like the vinyl, it's not even funny.  Buy this, it is the best band of all time sounding like it finally.      ~P
B001TODCII|5.0|Taken had some real spine tingling excitement that had my adrenaline flowing. I rate this movie among one of the top five of my favorites I have ever seen.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is the best Mgeadeth album since Countdown to Extinction and it rivals their best ever, including Rust in Peace. United Abominations was a step in the right direction and this takes it further than I could have imagined.    W.Freeman, in a review below, tries to parallel Megadeth's output with Metallica's and posits that Dave's entire career is born out of regret from being fired from Metallica.  Let me put forth another theory:    Endgame and Death Magnetic are not simply returns to earlier form.  Rather, both are sell outs.  Here's why.    Metal is BACK!!!!!!    There has been so much great metal from new bands the last few years that I can hardly stand it.  It's been garnering critical as well as popular accliam.  Acts such as Protest the Hero, Between the Buried and me and Torch have served to rekindle my belief in the power of metal and often times these band are also critically and commercially successful.      Also, look at the incredible popularity of the European meldodeath bands such as In Flames and Arch Enemy.    The last few years have been VERY good to metal, both in terms of quality of music and in units sold.    So, I wonder if  Dave and Company could have been putting out music like this all along and have only returned to such a form as the winds of fortune once again have begun to blow in the direction of metal.  On the one hand it saddens me to think that this could be the case. On the other hand, I am glad that they are \\"selling out\\" to the new tide of metal dominance and providing us with such great material as this.
B00005G9FO|5.0|The Seventies output of Herbie Hancock is right up there toe-to -toe with anything Miles did in the same period. The fact that Herbie is still around released records prolifically we might take him for granted. The four albums with Columbia in the Mid-70s are just monsters in funk and just sound better with age.
0684843137|4.0|Book was interesting.. I know it won a Pulitizer Prize but I was expecting much more.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|How do you value great art? People are complaining about the fact that they should have put mono and the stereo on one CD etc. but one simple fact is we are talking about the Beatles here and they can do whatever they like. It is heartening to know that people's pulses quicken at the mention of a new release of music and buy it rather than just download the thing. Maybe the Beatles could teach the younger generation the beauty of a body of a work and the magic of a band's chemistry firing on all cylinders and how life affirming great music can be. The sound is an improvement but not much, the Beatles always sounded great it is basically remarketing and sprucing it up a little bit. With the advent of SHM-CD and BLU-SPEC CD may be they were a little premature, but you can only get what's out there. With all the great bands having had their back catalogues all remastered and repackaged it feels like 9/9/09 is ground zero for music, we have turned full circle, what goes round comes round and all the dreadful and forgettable music of the last 15-20 years is behind us and we can move forward now. Just buy both box sets, Please Please Me,Rubber Soul,Revolver and Abbey Road for the car. The beauty of music is that it has no limitations and owning some Beatles is like owning some great works of art at an affordable price.
0316017922|3.0|I enjoyed Blink and Tipping Point but I felt Outliers read like it was put together on short notice. The examples Gladwell used to prove his conclusions at times seemed forced; like the evidence could have been interpreted many different ways and he just manipulated it to work for his point. It was still somewhat interesting but I wouldn't pay full price for it again. Pick it up used.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|The one the only Metallica baby listen this album is awesome!!!! I love every tune on this masterpiece this band never quits just like in one of their early tunes Whiplash theres a line in the song when James says \\"We will never stop will never quit because we are Metallica\\" hellyeah Death Magnetic easily matches up with some of their early classics like Ride the Lighting,Master of Puppets,And Justice For All......the highlights on this record would have to be The Day that never comes,That was just your life,The End of the line,All Nightmare long.I saw this band live in D.C. earlier this year for the first time and it was the best damn live show I ever saw they even outbeat the modern day live masters who would be Slipknot who also puts on a darn good one.Bottom line buy this album you want regret it unless your not a metalhead.If you are one of those Metallica fans from the begining that bashed them for selling out after the release of the Black album what the hell is wrong with you they are still the same great band my all time favorite band.Death Magnetic best album of 2008 period!!!!! check it out I am telling you a great purchase.
B001E3AXGS|4.0|Ms. Kearns has become a specialist on everything, every field, in the world.  She can be seen on Public TV and all historical programs.  I am amazed at her versatility.  This book proves that she does work on research without end.  It's nice for a girl of her background up North to have become a Walter Cronkite for us females and explain things in simple language everyone can understand.  More power to her!
B000SQJ27I|4.0|Another great album from Manu Chao. Highly recommended!! Not as excellent as some of his older albums (i.e.: Proxima Estación), but definitively a great set of songs. He is really a great artist. Additionally, it would be great for Manu to come up with some news sounds in his next album.     Anyway, you should get this album!
0385504225|4.0|Oh my dear triangles, pyramids, and other geometric shapes ... Your days of existing in plain sight are limited.  Mr. Brown will invoke and christen you with deep symbolical (and potentially religious importance) if you are not careful.      No longer can we ignore the obvious Nazi implications in the swastika patterns which may be drawn on maps in many grid-like housing developments in the United States (if you use your imagination (and a pen)).    No longer can we view a simple circle without reflecting on how it has been co-opted by the semi-secret sect of the Shriners to reflect the similarity between the treatment of childhood illnesses and the struggles of Sysiphus and his circular boulder of injustice.    Once again, with this tome, the wicked travesty of ancient, and fictional, secrecy is unearthed by the globe trotting detective / professor - Dan Brown - I mean Robert Langdon.  I pray for the day when this fictional depiction of both literal and figurative \\"Underground\\" societies and meeting rooms is brought to light via the magic of Hollywood (and Tom Hanks).  As a member of many secret societies I found the book to be entertaining enough to read from front to back (in my secret underground lair).
B002C6K7N0|3.0|First of all I'll give complete credit where it is due.  This album is super fast with mind blowing guitar playing. Which is great.  HOWEVER....the vocals are as flat as can be.    Dave's vocals are laid down very low over the guitar work and it's not really as if that matters because he's not singing at all on this album....all he is doing is talking over guitar work.    I prefer my Megadeth with melody and chorus lines that I can sing to. Although fast, this album is far removed from Countdown and System Has Failed, both of which were fast, hard albums that had chorus's that a person could sing along with.    I heard this style coming on United Abominations....but if this is the style that Dave is going to stick with...count me out.
B000P12LWY|1.0|Yes, there are lots of pretty clothes and plenty of airbrushed flesh. But the writers seem so interested in using the airtime to screen Henry's sexual encounters that the real ideological conflicts of the era are simplified into personal bitch-fights between different well-dressed aristocrats. The characters are superficially drawn - particularly the Protestant reformers, who are portrayed unsympathetically as zealous bigots or self promoting maniuplators. This is particularly true of Anne Boleyn, the most highly educated and intellectual of Henry's wives (with the possible equal of Katherine Parr), who genuinely believed in Protestant reform - here depicted as a callous tart under the total control of her ambitious father, who, rather than pursuing the cause of Reform herself, merely buys into the idea late in the day because it serves her man-hunting interests.    Even if you accept that this is purely for entertainment, not educational, purposes, it's worth wondering why the writers are suppressing some of the most interesting (and sexiest) bits of history! The intense courtship of Anne by Henry, which actually took several years and was rocked by spats, here is passed over in half an episode - probably because the authors can't wait to get Anne to give in and start rolling around on a bed. Whereas their real cat-and-mouse game, with her passionate insistence on virginity before marriage, and her fear that he would tire of her if she ever gave into him, would have been far more exciting.     This is brilliantly portrayed in Anne of A Thousand Days - again not with the greatest accuracy, but with much more emotional truth. I strongly recommend that you watch that instead! Then again, The Tudors, while trash, is strangely addictive - maybe it's all the pretty clothes!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is life changing, and at this price I don't know why everyone isn't in shape. I fondly call this workout my 30 minutes of 'heck' (keeping it clean.) It's hard, but I guarantee that you will see results. Without any changes to my diet I am seeing the results. I don't eat fast food, but I do eat dessert. I'm now going to start cutting calories to really maximize the changes. I had been doing an hour of treadmill and pilates and thought I was in pretty good shape. Not! Now in a half hour I'm getting results like I've never had.    I started this program 3 weeks ago. I did level one for two weeks and am on my second week of level two. I'm enjoying level two a lot. The exercises are actually fun (love the walk-out push-ups and pendulum lunges.) I also call level two the 'sexy shoulder workout.' It is intense on your shoulders - but I've always wanted sexy shoulders! I'm doing two weeks at each level, then I will rotate through the levels. I can feel different muscles working from level one to level two, so I think rotating after will keep me looking great.    The program lets you work at whatever level is comfortable to you. As you get stronger, you can intensify your workout so everyday is a challenge. Again, this is not easy. There hasn't been a day that I wasn't out of breath thinking I would die. But with warm-up and cool-down it's 30 minutes. Everyone can do this for 30 minutes.     My advice - don't give up. When you first start this, unless you are already doing lunges everyday, you will feel pain! Stairs will be a challenge. Trust me - give it 3 days and you will be fine. Keep doing the workouts. Think of the pain as a positive - it makes it harder to get to the kitchen. :) My sister has a personal trainer and I had to ask her how long before I could walk up and down stairs again. She said 3 days, she was right. Stick with it!    Be sure to drink even more water than you usually do. I have never sweat like I do with this video. Water is so good for you anyway. I even see my skin looking better since starting this workout.    No excuses! For less than $10 you can have this video and change your life. You don't need a gym, you don't need expensive equipment. If you don't have hand weights and don't want to spend the money, then use soup cans or something around the house. I'm using half pound wrist weights because that is what I had. I will get heavier weights to intensify the workout later. Half pound weights and I'm getting results! It's awesome.     Commit to the 30 minutes a day and you will be thankful. You will get results. You will feel better about yourself. Nobody is that busy - don't watch the evening news, learn how to use a slow cooker to cut dinner prep time (just don't turn to fast food!), surf ebay less, shower faster - get organized and make the time! You won't regret it.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|this is by far megadeth's best album in a long while. not taking anything away from the last few efforts such as ( the system has failed ) which i thought was a great album. from the second endgame started to the very end, i was blown away. there are sounds in this album that i have never even heard before. the album goes out with a bang with the amazing ( the right to go insane ). megadeth is a great example to new metal bands out there to show them how its done. its not all about cookie monster vocals!
B001I1123O|5.0|Reviews like this are tough, because the people who agree with the contents of the book will appreciate how elegantly Dawkins frames the universe and our existence in the distinct absence of \\"God\\" as most people think of God today.  The people who disagree probably won't bother reading the book to begin with.  But if you are unsure of your faith, and why you believe what you do, and the inconsistencies and problems with religion that you've seen first-hand, this book is for you! You aren't alone, and for good reason.  Dawkins instills a humorous dry wit about this book, mixing facetious yet exacting commentary with indelible logic to produce something that truly appeals to the rational and reasonable human.  I could read it over and over again.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This movie is A+++, it Shows how Corrupt our Government and Insurance companies truly are!!!!  Nice to know you can be a Visitor in another Country and get healthcare but not in the US. WOW that is Amazing. We are TAXED so Much in our Daily lives that it Should be \\"FREE\\" as in Europe, Canada, Even CUba??? Also there healthcare isn't free!! You just don't have a Bill when you Leave the Hospital, unlike the Great-HAHA Country of the US. We have health care for the Elderly why not everyone else??? Would it take 5 minutes longer than they want to spend to change it?? Bottom line the movie was good, and very eye opening to the other countries, that are suppose to be Not Good?????  But really are good in ways we are not good at. Too many people in this country have perks from the drug and ins companies. If it changes there perks will be taken away, heaven forbid that happens they might make 5 dollars less. Another thing this Country isn't just Capitalism(aka taking advantage of other people)it is also a little bit of Socialism with a DASH of Communism-yeah I said it and its true!!!

0156711427|5.0|E.M. Forster is truly one of the giants of early modern literature with his novels that bridge the gap between the traditional and the much looser modern forms.  \\"A Passage to India\\" was the last book published in his lifetime, the concluding chapter in a brilliant career centered around a handful of novels.  It makes one wonder if Forster had felt used up after the subjects he tackles in \\"A Passage to India\\" or if he felt that he could do no better.<br /><br />\\"A Passage to India\\" is set at the peak of the British colonial era and is rife with the racial tension that lurks beneath every mean aspect of daily life.  It is the tale of various characters.  One of the main characters is Dr. Aziz, a Moslem Indian who desperately wants to befriend certain English people but knows he may be overstepping his bounds.  One Englishman he successfully befriends, for a while, is Mr. Fielding, the principal of the local school who seems not to have developed the racist attitudes of the other English people who dwell in Chandrapore.  It is also the tale of two visiting women - Mrs. Moore, an old Christian lady who innocently befriends Dr. Aziz by accident.  She has brought with her Adela Quested, a young woman eager to see the \\"real\\" India who finds that she will not do so if she agrees to marry Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny.  In an attempt to bridge the gap between the races, Dr. Aziz sets in motion a series of events that will have near-fatal consequences for himself as well as those he tries to befriend.<br /><br />Forster had a rare gift for storytelling that is natural and unforced.  His writing is a mix of subtle humor and astute observations about human nature, raising questions of philosophy and religion in an attempt to ponder the nature of racism that bored so deep a root in British colonial India.  What is remarkable about \\"A Passage to India\\" is that while it is set in a very concrete time and place, the themes it raises transcend time and offer some insight into present conflicts.  It is easy to see why \\"A Passage to India\\" is considered to be one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, for Forster was at his peak form in this eloquent ode to the impossibilities and the improbabilities of friendship.easy to see why \\"A Passage to India\\" is considered to be one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, for Forster was at his peak form in this eloquent ode to the impossibilities and the improbabilities of friendship.
B00000JLWW|3.0|Take any cheesy love story worthy of Mills and Boon. Set it against one of the worst shipping disasters of modern times, being sure to pad the story out so the film overruns by at least two hours. Add in some \\"ground breaking\\" special effects, and you have yourself an Oscar-winning epic, 1997-style.  Anachronisms abound. (Rose giving the \\"finger\\" - I half expected her to say \\"kiss my ass!\\") The \\"class warfare\\" angle is ridiculously overplayed, and just in case we *really* don't get it, no mention is made of the fact that the Titanic had classes of accommodation other than \\"first\\" and \\"steerage\\". Presumably the second class passengers spent the entire time below decks.  When the truth doesn't fit the class agenda, Cameron simply makes it up - witness the steerage class passengers locked below decks while the toffs boarded the lifeboats, and the officer who murders several passengers before turning a gun on himself (a shameful fiction which did not please the real fellow's living relatives; Cameron was forced to apologise).  \\"Titanic\\" was condemned in some sections of the English press as an \\"anti-English\\" film. In truth, it's simply a lazy movie which exploits Hollywood clichés (hence the English-accented villains) and twists the truth to suit its own prejudices.  In summary, \\"Titanic\\" is a dull, uninspired film which does the Titanic story a disservice. If this is the template that Cameron is using, I sincerely hope he doesn't have a \\"9/11\\" movie in the pipeline. \\"Titanic\\" could scarcely have been less credible if Cameron had filmed an all-out action adventure, with Arnie in the title role, and it would surely have been more entertaining!

B001AP11KW|4.0|I'm not that familiar with White Stripes stuff (yet) but I have one album and granted it's not their best but there's still something that intrigues you about Jack White.  It might be his energy but it's probably more his originality.  Now with the formation of The Dead Weather, it's good to see someone with a keen talent not waste it wrapped up with one band or group.  Call me crazy, but I think he very much reminds me of Beck when it comes to creating music that is different, refreshing, nostalgic, raw all in the saw album.  (yah, I still call them albums)

B0025KVLTW|5.0|I have the singles of all the side 2 material, and what I've always noticed about mono v. stereo on singles and albums is the amount of care George Martin in particular took in the mono mix, which is especially evident on MMT, SPLHCB and The BEATLES, in which harmonies, guitar solos, etc., are more prevalent than the stereo mixes (think Savoy Truffle, I'm So Tired, Good Morning/Sgt Pepper reprise segue, MMT's \\"Roll Up Roll Up.. Hurry Hurry Hurry\\"....). One thing is indeed clear: some of the mono mixes tend to be at least a few seconds longer, especially All You Need is Love and Baby You're a Rich Man, as mentioned here. The original US LP (and the \\"1967-1970\\" US LP) released in 1967 along with Hello Goodbye/I Am the Walrus, had fake stereo mixes of the late single, AYNiL and BYaRM. HG/IAtWalrus were available to Capitol USA in true stereo because they were released in both stereo and mono versions on the UK EP, but this last single was not, Capitol only had the mono mixes and reprocessed them for stereo. So, the original US LP had the 3:09 version of Baby...., but the stereo mix, first appearing in Australia in the early '70s, was much shorter, so we don't hear the last chorus and the extended Baby you're a rich Maaaaaaaaaannnnnn\\", like what we hear on the Yellow Submarine DVD of Hey Bulldog.    That being said, why does no one seem to pay attention to the awesome guitar work on Baby You're a Rich Man?????!!!!!! OK, here's what you do: reduce the bass and treble, bring up the midrange, pull it over to left only where you DON't hear the piano and main drums (maybe the snare overdub later). Just listen to that chunky guitar, and for you guitarists out there, I dare you to duplicate it! I've been playing for nearly 30 years and can't get it note for note! I still remember the first time I heard the Stereo version and that guitar part: it was a Beatles A-Z radio program which used \\"only the UK recordings because of the clarity and stereo versions...\\" like I Feel Fine and BYaRM, back in 1983 or so. Baby... was introduced thus: \\"It's a powerful piece with some fine bass from Paul, and great sitar-sounding guitar from George.\\" Was this George's first use of slide on record???  I really wish the remaster or the YS remix would have brought that out into the open. And when are we going to get an SACD of the YS Soundtrack like on the DVD, but with complete versions? It's All Too Much just SLAYS me on the movie 5.1!!!!    And one other thing, I would LOVE to see an OFFICIAL Rarities CD that includes the US Rarities versions, remixed, like I Am the Walrus with extra Yellow Matter Custard beats and the Penny Lane trumpet ending, along with all the other alternate versions we don't have on CD, like the Apple true stereo pressing of I'm Only Sleeping, along with I Call Your Name, I Should Have Known Better, Thank You girl, From Me To You, all those with alternate releases.    Agreed?????

B00009R86L|4.0|This is a very comfortable and well-designed shoulder pad.  I use it for a messenger bag that didn't come with a pad.  The padding has the perfect consistency to prevent \\"digging in\\" -- as one poster mentioned, the rubber pad does \\"shed\\" a bit, kind of like a pencil eraser, but it's really no big deal -- I rubbed it on my jeans for a few seconds when I first got it and that knocked off most everything that might have ended up on my shirt in the future. I use it cross-shoulder, and the angled cut of the pad is perfect for this, but I'm sure it'd be pretty comfy hanging straight down too.  The plastic backing looks rigid in the photo but it too is very flexible, though it spreads the load of my bag's thin strap nicely over the whole pad.    All in all, a good buy for this price and I'm glad I chose it over the other pads available on amazon.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|One of the most superbly produced CDs. The music was bodacious and very enjoyable. The producer Mark Johnson and co-producer Enzo Buono captured the beauty of the music and the musicans entirely throughout the CD and DVD.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|As a hardcore rocker and a lover of symphonic metal, I was surprised that I have enjoyed this album as much as I have since it is a very polished first release designed for 'mass popular appeal' (normally a musical death sentence).  However, the very powerful, over-the-top, and outstanding female vocal performance by lead singer Lizzy Hale, the catchy tunes and phrasing, and the very good and well-practiced backup band make for a compelling listen.  This is not a boring album or a series of plain-jane musical compositions.  I found myself playing this album over and over (maybe there is something wrong with me!).  This band has been winding up a loooooong time before releasing this album, and the effort is obvious.  In any case, I have a weak spot for such powerful female singers - gets me right in the gut (it's a guy thing).  My congratulations to this young band on a fine first effort.  However, don't expect Bob Dylan lyrics as the message is based on popular music themes (not too much depth).  However, give these 'kids' time to grow up a little, and perhaps their lyrics will catch up to the outstanding musical effort shown here.  Hey Guys - this gal Lizzy Hale deserves some serious attention and a good listen - she's a very strong and terrific rock singer who can seriously belt it out.

Get Lucky arrived yesterday...by the second playing, I'm totally hooked.    Each MK release has a slightly different mood to it, but each has that magic guitar, those sometimes silly but amazing lyrics and of course MK's voice. Get Lucky is no exception.    I'd rate this recording a 10 if I could, yes, I guess I'm biased...I admit it. It's an absolutely beautiful group of songs.

0061537969|3.0|It's a little juvenile, and it comes across as a sort of self-help book, but it has its appeal, especially if you're car racing fanatic.  Also, it's narrated by a dog, Enzo, who understands a lot more about what's going on than some of the people.  Denny, his owner, experiences setback after setback, heartbreak after heartbreak, but keeps on trucking, so to speak, and doggedly, I might add.  In fact, Denny is a little too perfect.  Enzo expects to be reincarnated as a man with all of Denny's best qualities, including his love and aptitude for racing.  In this life, unfortunately, Enzo can't speak, and that inadequacy, along with the lack of opposing thumbs, is a source of endless frustration for him.  He's pretty much on target, though, in his assessment of the various human characters that populate the book; I love it that he dubs Enzo's in-laws the Evil Twins, a moniker that they richly deserve.  Mostly, the book offers up car racing as a metaphor for life.  Even though I thought the writing was pedantic (What can you expect from a dog?), I boohooed at the emotional ending.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|let me start off by saying that i am an extremely huge fan of porcupine tree and i plan on being as non biased as possible in this review.  i give all pt albums 5 stars but personally i dont think this is their best work.  i recieved my copy of the incident about 4 days earlier than the release date because i had ordered the deluxe edition.  with the deluxe edition came; 2 cd's, the first being the 12 part incident, the second being 4 more seperate songs not having to deal with the main title track.  also with the deluxe edition comes a hardback book of lasse hoile's photographs and also a smaller book of someone else's drawings.  if you go to porcupine tree's website or myspace page, you can hear the incident samples and a radio edit of time flies from the cd.  after listening to that 7 minute sample and time flies about 1,000 times i really wasnt sure what to excpect.  let me tell you that the edited version of time flies doesnt do that song justice.  each cd pt has released tends to be different from the last, but in a good way.  being able to change the way you write music for every single album yet still maintining a specific sound makes things fresh and always suprises the listener.  the incident is no exception.  i was going to review this album track by track but the best piece of advice i can give is to listen to this album as a whole.  there are pieces of this cd that are better than others, but listening to it as a whole completely changes the way each song sounds.  steven wilson takes you on a musical journey with this album.  sit back, relax, if you have the 5.1 dts surround version definitely listen to that one first, and just enjoy what the most underrated musicians in the world have to offer. most people like pt or at least respect pt for something they have released, my favorite being fear of a blank planet.  i know all my friends love in absentia....i enjoy that album too but for different reasons.  the incident is a blend of all their previous works plus some new sounding material which they have never done before.  pick up this album as soon as you can.
B000MU4EGY|5.0|Unlike it's British counterpart of the same title, the American version of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is a soundtrack featuring eight songs preformed by The Beatles and four instrumental interpretations of Lennon/McCartney originals preformed by the George Martin Orchestra. Originally issued in both stereo and mono on June 26, 1964, this was the fourth Beatles album to be released in the United States and the second album to be officially released on a label other than Capitol (the first being \\"Introducing The Beatles\\" [Vee-Jay Records, issued July 22, 1963], \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" being released by United Artists as the \\"Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" ).    All of the Beatles songs on the mono and stereo releases were created from the same mono master tape, the later being \\"duophonic\\" (a process of slightly altering e.q., panning and levels to create a \\"stereo\\" image) mixes created by the engineers at United Artists. Capitol would issue it's own versions of five of the eight Beatles tracks less than one month later (July 20, 1964) on it's ironically titled \\"Something New\\" album. Of the three remaining songs, \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" would not see release on a Capitol album until the February 26, 1970 release of the \\"Hey Jude / The Beatles Again\\" compilation. The title track would not see a Capitol album release until the April 2, 1973 compilation \\"1962-1966\\" (also known as \\"The Red Album\\").     The four instrumental tracks by the George Martin Orchestra are jazz/lounge interpretations of Beatles songs. Unlike the tracks by The Beatles, The instrumentals were issued from separate mono and stereo masters, the later being \\"true\\" stereo. Although dismissed by most fans as \\"filler\\", these versions featured prominently in the film and bring to mind various scenes (who could forget Ringo's sad walk along the river to the instrumental tune of \\"This Boy\\"?) . Taken in the context that this is a soundtrack album (and bonus points that these are Lennon/McCartney originals, not anonymous score by an anonymous composer), these tunes are actually quite enjoyable!    This is the version of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" that most American Beatles fans grew up with. The 1987 release of the Beatles EMI catalogue on cd replaced the various early Capitol albums and introduced America to the Beatles original albums the way the Beatles intended them to be heard.  What was once twelve albums on Vee-Jay, Capitol and United Artists was now only seven albums on Parlophone.  While the Parlophone albums were superior in most aspects,  American fans soon began to notice that differences went beyond the running order and album titles. Some tracks were completely different mixes featuring different sounds (Capitol \\"Rubber Soul\\" had 2 false starts at the beginning of \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", not on the Parlophone release, etc.) and gone were the instrumental tracks from \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help!\\".    EMI/Capitol finally saw fit in 2004 and again in 2006 to give the American fans back the albums that they grew up with in the form of two box sets, \\"The Capitol Albums\\" and \\"The Capitol Albums Vol. 2\\". Both box sets are completely remastered and feature both stereo and mono versions on the same cd as well as wonderful reproductions of the original artwork in the form of mini-sleeves. Unfortunately, only eight of the original twelve American albums have been released on cd. Missing are \\"Introducing The Beatles\\", \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Yesterday...And Today\\" and \\"Revolver\\". \\"Introducing\\" is null as it was released on Capitol as \\"The Early Beatles\\", but the remaining three (along with maybe  1977's \\"At The Hollywood Bowl\\") would make a wonderful final box set as everything from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" forward was the same worldwide. [Capitol acquired the United Artists catalogue in the early 80's and subsequently re-issued this very same soundtrack - so inclusion in a Capitol box set would remain \\"authentic\\"]    Overall, this is a fun soundtrack to afun film. This is the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania, simple pop songs with great hooks that will have you singing along. Innocent. Nothing deep, nothing philosophical. Songs about falling in love, being in love, and losing love.  If you listen to this enough, you may also catch yourself singing along with the instrumentals! If you have access to a turntable, this would be a welcome addition to your Beatles collection. To the American generation who grew up on the 1987 standardized cd catalogue, you should definitely hear this version at least once  to better experience Beatlemania as your parents (and dare I say grandparents) did.

B001PPLIEG|1.0|Sorrowfully, I watched approximately 30 minutes of this drivel, has the world gone mad? A movie needs a real plot, sheer violence, noise, blood and mind trash won't fill the bill. I feel sorry for those with a favorable review, for it means that they have settled for the very least in entertainment, flying bodies in chase scenes, which occur every few minutes, and moving so fast through the cameras lens that they are indiscernable as whether they are villian or ''secret agent''. A sensible reason for this mass slaughter escapes the movie, with a thin, and transparent story line. I can get pretty much the same line of entertainment in ''South Park'', and even that makes more sense. Hopefully, I wait for another ''Bourne'' movie, with a real plot, some human relationships, and violence where necessary, not as the main theme. Count this one out..

B001DUKHXQ|5.0|This seller shipped the item very promptly and very well packaged.  I have only recently gotten back into vinyl now seeig that it is making a comeback.  I must say, that after 20 plus years of listening to CD's and MP3's, those 20 something year olds DO have a very VALID  point, vinyl records sound much better!  If you don't believe me, dig out your old turntable  if you still have it, buy a new cartridge, belt (if necessary) and plug it in to a GOOD amplifier and speakers, or headphones.  I  found myself  saying \\"what the hell was I and so many others thinking over 20 years ago\\" when thinking about how I and so many others went out and bought CD's of  albums that we already had on vinyl.  Not to mention the new purchases.  A few weeks ago I talked to 3 guys all in their early 20's.  They have been raised on CD's and MP3's and IPODS only.  They each said they recenlty dug out their parents turntables  this past summer along with some of their parents music that THEY listen to (go figure!) plus they can now buy NEW releases on a increasing vinyl offering in retail stores!  They are the people driving the resurgence  in vinyl.  I did the same and found that they are right!  This particular album makes a great 25th Anniversary tribute especially since  Michael died.  I urge you to buy it from this seller as it is very reasonably priced.  Many other sellers are selling it for much more.
0671015206|4.0|The premise of this book is straight forward, the majority of millionaire's in the United States are individuals that save a considerable proportion of their earnings, budget their money meticulously, live below their means, and invest savings in capital gains.<br /><br />While these lessons seem obvious or even trite, the insights of both Thomas Stanley and William Danko helped me to view spending in a different way. For example, one of the major lessons of this book is to emphasize that earnings are not a reflection of accumulated wealth. Paradoxically, many people that have high incomes often have a difficult time saving money, and consequently do not have financial security or independence. This is due to the fact that many with higher incomes usually have higher mortgages (expensive homes in expensive neighborhoods), have to spend more on depreciating items like cars and suits, spend more money for private schools for their children, etc.<br /><br />I believe that a fine balance needs to be struck. I agree with many of the other commentators that rated this book much lower, that this book can often be repetitive, and more importantly, it's chief lesson is one of frugality that ultimately lowers one's \\"enjoyment\\" out of life. I agree that it feels nice to own nice things and to get out of our earnings what we put in, rather than merely watch our accounts grow for a sense of security and stability. But I also appreciate that that security can lead to far less worry about the future. A balance must be struck, and for many of us that live high consumption lifestyles, this book can help to reign us in, even if just a little. It has helped me to appreciate my money more, after all, I earned it, and it would be nice to one day have enough that some of it could just sit there, piling up on itself.<br /><br />For those that wish for the secret to this book, it's live conservatively, be frugal. Don't pay for things that depreciate in value, don't make your children dependent on you financially, force them to earn for themselves even if that means having to force them out of the nest. Think about your money, think about how you spend it. Spend wisely, invest wisely, and be willing to pay for good advice on those things (tax accountants, money managers, etc.).y, force them to earn for themselves even if that means having to force them out of the nest. Think about your money, think about how you spend it. Spend wisely, invest wisely, and be willing to pay for good advice on those things (tax accountants, money managers, etc.).
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I've been a fan of Muse for a while and it's been about 10 years since they've been making music. However, I am not in love with this album, but I don't exactly look down on it in disgust. It's a great listen, but not a lot of the songs stick out to me.       Yes Muse has progressed, no doubt, but some of the album sounds recycled. If you listen closely, the guitar in Unnatural Selection sounds exactly like the guitar in the beginning of New Born. The way Matt sings in Exogeneis sounds similar to how he sang in Micro Cuts. There are, of course, some songs that I do quite enjoy. Uprising is the most passionate on this album. At first I wasn't impressed, but I find the chorus to be really uplifting.      \\"They... will... not.. control... us!\\" rings loud into my ears.       I Belong to You, is the song that reminds me of their classic work. It has that jazzy swing to it that I've always loved. Definitely catchy. I ironically like Undisclosed Desires, despite the fact that it has a poppy/RnB feel to it, I am rather intrigued with the chorus, and I think it's a nice listen. Exogensis is a symphonic set of songs. They're really lovey, but a little mellow in my opinion.       Aside from those songs, nothing has really stuck out to me. Guiding Light is perhaps the weakest on the track. And the album doesn't exactly have a nice flow to it, being that the songs all have a different range of style.      Overall a nice listen, but kind of mellow and pale considering that this is Muse. I will always be a Muse fan, but I'm just not as impressed with this one. One of the things I love about them is their amazing guitar riffs and breath taking piano solos. I'd recommended Origins of Symmetry or Absolution since those albums show their creative peak in my opinion. Basically I don't feel like their soul and creativity was poured into this one.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|Authors note: This review was made after about 30 listens, not the first or second one. I, by chance, went to a local record store to reserve a copy and they said they would sell me a copy now since it would be stupid to make me wait when I could literally see it... yeah, that was awesome.      Pros: Very heavy! Very Fast! Very Technical! A guitar clinic, with one of the best guitarist I have ever heard.  The production value is through the roof, and the song arrangements are on par with anything Megadeth has done.  Dave put a lot of time into the choruses of the album, as they are all original arrangements. None of the choruses are in a cooky cutter format.    Dave's singing may have diminished a little bit since the last album, but if your a Megadeth fan that is probably not the biggest concern.  His guitar work on the other hand has significantly improved as his solos don't have the stiff contrast from the lead guitarist's solos as they usually have.    Chris Broderick is absolutely insane on the lead guitar.  Some of his sweeps are crazy fast, but it is definitely not mindless shred, though definitely shred for shred's sake.  James Lamenzo is unfortunately not as prominent as in the last album.  This is unfortunate as he is awesome, I dare say better than Junior was.  His tone is very fat and heavy, and is definitely crucial to the sound, which is something Megadeth bassists havent been able to say a lot.  Shawn Drover just lays it down fast and heavy, but Dave doesn't demand much more than for him to rock out with the double bass pedals flying.    Cons: I am a fan of Megadeth lyrics.  They are usually very educated, and very vivid.  They are rarely cliche, usually very distinguished.  This album has some of the worst lyrics on select songs.  It is as though to make an awesome album something had to be sacrificed.  This isn't to say the lyrics are bad all the way through, just a select few moments: such as the verses of 44 minutes (it just doesn't even sound lyrical, its too straight forward); This Day We Fight has a few lines that feel like it was an ode to the gamer fan base; Endgame has some more of the radio talk Dave loves so much, which worked really well in Blackmail the Universe and worked pretty well in United Abominations, but doesnt work so hot in this one; Hardest Part of Letting Go starts off sounding like it was written by the fantasy nerd who has no skills to talk to the hot chick in class.  Who knows what how the story ends is about.    Song by Song   Dialectic Chaos: (9/10) Great arrangement with badass solos. Very heavy and fast. About two minutes of shred in the likeness of Into the Lungs of Hell. Enters perfectly into...    This Day We Fight: (9/10) Starts balls-out-metal.  Definition of speed metal.  The vocal arrangement is great, and after the first line, the lyrics are great in the battle sense, a la slayer war ensemble. Shredding solos interlude each verse, which means it has like 20 solos (hyperbole, of course).            44 Minutes: (7.5/10)  Starts off with an eighties epic melodic intro that kinda gets ruined by a police radio. THE blemish of the album is the lyrics of this song... just terrible verses... this is made up for by a great and harmonious chorus that has a great and original arrangement.  The solo that ends the song is unbelievably fast and really sounds like a machine gun.          1320:  (10/10) A highlight of the album.  Fast and energetic, great arrangement with the vocals and rhythm as it keeps changing to maintain the listeners attention.  Cool chorus about racing fast cars.  This song is really all about the couple minutes of soloing at the end.  This is just a total shred fest that keeps going, and going, and going, but yet keeps you intranced, until just as you think it couldnt shred anymore it wails your head off.  If they dont play this one live it will be a crime against humanity.         Bite The Hand: ( 8/10 ) Heavy, and midtempoed for Megadeth, which means pretty fast by anyone elses standards.  This is an example of Mustaines social commentary gone good.  Great vocal arrangements, very original chorus, very energetic. Just when you think the song is going to repeat the chorus into a boring end it breaks into a cool instrumental/ solo similar to an Iron Maiden Wasted Years.         Bodies: (9/10) One of the cooler songs on the album. The verse is pretty cool, but the chorus really takes the song.  A really catchy and badass chorus that the second time through goes into a slower paced and harmonious instrumental that of course breaks into a badass solo.         Endgame: (9/10) Starts off with a kind of cheesey Dave intercom thing.  The lyrics are a little suspect.  It isn't pulled off quite as well as United Abominations (the song), which I thought was awesome. It starts at a mid tempo, but breaks off into an awesome thrash rhythm.  The pre chorus solos start with this really cool dissonant harmony and end with an awesome wail, kind of like a Testament Electric Crown melodie into Dimebag wails.  Awesome solos a plentiful in this one.  The ending riff is bad ass, but strangely could use more solos, as it kind of leads you to think there is gonna be a super epic ending instead of a moderately epic ending, kind of like what they did with Blessed are the Dead.      Wierdly enough, this song leads into the next one really well.      Hardest Part of Letting Go... Sealed with a Kiss (8/10):  I really like the prog sense of this song and the vocal arrangement.  The chorus to the Hardest Part of Letting Go is pretty cool, but the lyrics start out pretty bad.  The song breaks into a fast \\"Sealed with a Kiss\\" part.  Wailing solo of course          Headcrusher(7/10): Pretty much a reinterpretation of Sleepwalker, fast and thrashy, but it is pretty boring and really doesn't change.  I don't know why this one was picked for the video.  It is in my opinion the dullest song on the album.  The end solo is really overshadowed by the excellence ofthe rest of the album          How the Story Ends (8/10):  Starts off with a cool riff and has a cool verse riff.  The vocal arrangement is cool just like the rest of the album, but the lyrics are a little lacking.  I really don't know exactly what it is about...  kind of about war.  Has a classical guitar entrance to the solo, which in turn has a neo-classical feel to it.          The Right to Go Insane ( 8.5/10 ) Starts off as the slowest tempo next to Hardest Part... The verse is pretty standard, and just like the rest of the album, Dave obviously put a lot of time into the chorus.  What else would you expect but ending the album with tearing solos.
0385504225|2.0|This book 10 years ago would have been pretty good.<br /><br />Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons had a certain X-factor about them the same way The Sixth Sense did. They spoke to something that most people found very interesting. This book falls flat. It feels like a re-tread of his first two average works with nothing interesting thrown in. There were no original or often overlooked concepts that challenged your pre-conceived notions about anything. Considering he took 4 years to write this and it came out after National Treasure... well let me say I think most people, myself included, had higher hopes.<br /><br />Maybe he had to re-tool it to be different than the movie National Treasure and that lead to delay and some unbelievable plot resolutions?<br /><br />For me the set up just doesn't make any sense. Why anyone would keep THAT particular secret so hidden, set up that many riddles, , under so many levels of intrigue with such elaborate codes, for that 'treasure' is beyond my ability to suspend belief while reading a fictional book. It just wasn't plausible for me. Nor was the bad guy. It was predictable and impossible all at the same time. Not only that, but I would guess most people knew where it was hidden almost from the get go.<br /><br />Lastly, there was too much 'I'm an expert and I'm going to give a pointless monologue to show off how much I know [read: research the author did] about this topic...'<br /><br />To sum up: had this been Dan Browns first work it would show great potential. Had it come out 10 years ago when some of these concepts weren't quite as main stream, and before Freemasons became so popular it would have been intriguing and maybe original. In light of all that, and as his 5th book, an that most people reading it probably watched National Treasure and have read other Mason-lore books, and having taken 4 years to write it was a major let down.
B000IY06CK|5.0|Ms. Fischer's a very attractive young woman as can be ascertained from the cover art. Naturally I was curious about how she played and when I saw the silly negative review I determined to buy it. Now there should be no mystery about how to play the Tchaikowsky as every student essays it at some time and Heifetz showed the world how the fiddle could be played. So I expected to hear a good performance since she was playing with a Russian orchestra and naturally they own the piece. I wasn't dissappointed. If this is the only recording of the Tchaikowsky in your library you are not missing anything. Fischer has a great bow arm and plays beautifully especially the ppp parts. Some people go to a wedding and complain the bride is too beautiful. I tend to disregard the critics or hypersophisticated nitpickers.
B00243FQFA|5.0|We are true Stargate fans.  We have all the DVDs for SG-1 and Atlantis.  The DVDs have such great clarity and color - we enjoy them over and over.  The shows should never have been cancelled.  They are fun, interesting, funny, and many episodes are thought-provoking in that they make us ponder events and issues here in our real lives.  We love the series and miss it very much.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I've long detested the PS3 controller. It's too small, the thumb-sticks are in slightly odd positions, and the triggers are far too small. I have chosen games for my 360 over my PS3 a number of times simply because I didn't want to spend countless hours suffering with the buttons and triggers that seemed clearly made for children or some sort of Willy Wonka factory worker.    Then, I discovered RealTriggers. As soon as they arrived, I snapped them onto the controller (a very simple and easy one-step process that uses no adhesives of any kind) and immediately found what I'd been looking for all this time. They fit snugly, using a sort of click-in mechanism rather than any glue or tape. They snap on with ease in seconds and are very durable. I've just purchased my second set to put on my other controller.    I would absolutely advise purchasing these to anyone who finds the PS3 controller's triggers to be difficult or awkward out of the box. You'll be grateful you spent the few dollars to enhance your comfort.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|....then you absolutely have to have this. The sound quality and the ability to adjust the different volumes is outstanding. I play Call of Duty about 90% of the time online and this just makes the entire online experience better. I use to get into games with kids making annoying noises etc. Now with the push of a finger I don't have to listen to it but I can still hear the game perfectly. In fact, a buddy and me went into a private match on shipment. I could hear him from across the map setting up claymore's, pulling grenade pins, moving and even swiping his knife. The only negative thing I have to say about this headset is that it's not wireless but I am sure that would add quite a lot of money to the price. They are also extremely light and comfortable and .................................................You know what, stop reading this and just go buy a set of these already.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|Excellent Fantasy Advanture! Can anyone tell me if the new Ultimate Additions have more footage than the original Blue Ray version?
1402210795|3.0|This was not particularly a favorite Heyer book for me. I thought the characters were great - they were indeed characters! The hero (Sherry) and heroine (Hero) are very atypical. But I felt lost as to where this book was headed - and maybe that's good, it kept me going - but as Hero keeps getting into one predictament after another, I grew a little frustrated. (Maybe feeling like Sherry.) Anyway, it was one I almost gave up on.

B002CMLIJ6|4.0|\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" got bashed pretty hard by critics when it opened, and I won't deny that it's not in a league with \\"X-Men 2\\" or \\"The Dark Knight\\" (what other comic book-based films are?), but viewing it on DVD, I found that I really wasn't disappointed in it, with much of the credit going to Hugh Jackman. He has such charisma and intensity that when he's onscreen, I find that plotholes don't bother me nearly as much...and this is certainly his best performance as Wolverine, yet.<br /><br />If anything, the film is guilty of trying to accomplish too much; trying to answer all of the questions raised in the first three films nearly guarantees that some depth will have to be sacrificed (and the filmmakers were well aware that this could well be the last film of the franchise, and wanted to tie up loose ends). But what emerges isn't just a resolution, but a new chapter, as well, with new characters (Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit are standouts), a love interest you actually cared about (Lynn Collins), and a terrific love/hate relationship between Logan and his brother, Victor/Sabertooth (Liev Schreiber). I won't deny, though, it was fun seeing Patrick Stewart, again, briefly reprising his role as Professor Xavier (and looking more youthful, thanks to CGI).<br /><br />From a boyhood discovering his 'gifts' in the Canadian Rockies of the 1840s, to an explosive 1970s climax at Three-Mile Island (ah, the real reason for the near melt-down!), the Wolverine saga certainly deserves more than a one-film 'wrap', but it is fun!<br /><br />Two Special Features are worth your attention, as well; a conversation between 'Wolverine' creater Len Wein and 'X-Men' creator Stan Lee is light-hearted and entertaining, with both giving sincere credit to Jack Kirby and Chris Clarement's involvement; and the 'Making Of' featurette is an often funny look of Jackman's total commitment to an exercise/diet regimen to be as 'bulked' as possible as Wolverine. He ends the piece with the hope that fans like the latest entry enough that he can play the role again, as he loves the character.<br /><br />I really hope he gets his wish!e that fans like the latest entry enough that he can play the role again, as he loves the character.    I really hope he gets his wish!

B001GCUO16|3.0|I was going to buy this on Amazon, but happened into WMart the day it was released.  They have it on blue ray with a free digital copy and I think it came with either a 2 or 3 disk for about the same price.  The movie was good.  I enjoyed getting the background on Wolverine.  Even my wife enjoyed it and now I get a free copy for my IPOD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Pulling up this product to post my review I found myself a little shocked at the very low overall rating this film has received.  148 three-star reviews?  227 two-star reviews?  572 one-star reviews?  Really?  I can't help but wonder how this marvelous film can receive such little love.  Sure, it has 728 five-star reviews (729 if you count mine) but the fact that it has nearly 1,000 mediocre-to-bad ratings is shocking to me, in a bad way.  How could people `not get' this movie?  I think that reviewer Greg Frayser was right; people just `don't get it'.<br /><br />That is sad, because what Sophia Coppola has done here is create and deliver a touching and poignant look at humanity at its purest, which is something we rarely see today.<br /><br />A lot of times we see raw and honest portrayals of the dark side of humanity when we look at intelligent cinema.  All too often our own realistic brutality is splashed across the screen, bringing us closer to our very own demons.  I applaud filmmakers brave enough to ascertain the notion that honesty is the best policy, willing to expose us for who we are without a care for the audience reaction.  This pays off extremely well for some, and I have to admit that I have always gravitated towards the darker corners of the cinematic experience.  I feel the need though, especially after seeing all the negative response to this film, to single out Coppola for doing the exact opposite.  Instead of focusing on the parts of us we want to hide from, Coppola exposes the purity that is in most of us; giving us a breath of fresh air in a society fixated on clich&eacute;s and fantastical distortions of reality.  `Lost in Translation' is a beautiful and honest account of two people who, simply put, fill and need within one another.<br /><br />Both Bob and Charlotte are in a strange place, both literally and figuratively.  They are both in Tokyo, so there's the `literal' strange place, but they are also both in a difficult and confusing emotional state within their own lives.  Bob, an actor, is lost in his own aspirations.  He isn't sure why he does what he does.  He seems almost apathetic, but it's not apathy that is slowly killing him; it's an emptiness he cannot quite understand.  Charlotte, who is traveling with her husband (who is working), is just as lost.  Her marriage is new yet feeling tired and her husband's friends and personality make her feel out of place.  When you are already empty and alone then strange places can feel like prisons as apposed to adventures.  Both Bob and Charlotte find themselves resenting the absurdity of their surroundings because, in their state, everything is void of meaning.<br /><br />But by chance they meet, and they bond, and soon they find that there is purpose.<br /><br />Sophia Coppola is a personal favorite of mine.  She has only made three films so far but all three have been extremely thought-provoking and intelligent, and wildly creative.  I love her style, which is unique and visionary.  The word auteur is not thrown around carelessly, but I would toss that word in her direction because she has proven with just three movies to have her own distinct and poignant vision.<br /><br />And the way she works with actors is a dream!<br /><br />Bill Murray is a great comedian, one who I adore in nearly everything.  This performance will go down in history as his greatest achievement.  I only wish this had netted him the Oscar (much better than Penn's hammy victory) for his performance is so rich with meaning and depth.  He really understood how to use his unique brand of deadpan humor to create a man who is very real and very personable.  Don't even get me started on Scarlett Johansson's lack of an Oscar nomination here, for in my opinion she gave THE PERFORMANCE OF 2003.  She matches Murray scene for scene, but the natural flourishes she adds to her scenes elevate her slightly above him in my opinion.  Just watch the way she adds a flinch or a chuckle here and there, adding color and individuality to such a beautifully fleshed out character.<br /><br />There are few films that can reach this level of earnest beauty.  One recent film that comes very close is `Once'.  You walk away feeling this inner warmth and the only word I can use to describe it is `pure'; `Lost in Translation' is very, very pure.hed out character.

B001HN69AE|4.0|Don't know why all the other reviews were bad, but I enjoyed the movie. I also thought the video and audio quality was excellent. I am referring to the blu ray format. Don't know anything about the DVD format. But for me, this was a good movie.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|Again from my favorite electric guitar player singer/songwriter comes a breath of new songs to reinforce my love for his music. Get Lucky on first listen was like a soundtrack as I had it on while making dinner. Upon second listen, I sat down and really listened to each song, their content, and I'm just blown away by the songcraft. I'm not going to get into what every song means...gets kind of redundant due to other reviewers repeating it, but the journey which is Get Lucky is worth every second. Beautiful melodies, great lyrics, and an especially moving closer. The world is a better place with Mark Knopfler's gift and genius. A++++
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bob Dylan albums.  Its impossible to put my finger on it, but it generates a feeling that is timeless.  It deals with difficult topics, but with an attitude that rises above it all!  And the lyrics are both brilliant and very fun too.  I think this album deserves alot more attention.  Its like a whirlwind tour of traditional American music, synthesizing elements of rock, jazz, blues, country, etc...  On top of that, it sounds both old/classic and new/fresh at the same time.  A monumental achievement and a testament to Bob's genius!
B002F3BQ9E|5.0|After years of only being available on the rare and expensive out-of-print UK Columbia vinyl, Sundazed finally released the mono version of this great album in the United States. This mono version features a unique mix from the more common stereo version, and people with the recent CD remaster of \\"Truth\\" can get a taste of the mono mix with the bonus track of the mono \\"Beck's Bolero\\". Shame the mono version is only available on vinyl, it deserves a CD release as well.
B001I1123O|4.0|I think it's necessary to state right up front that I expected to hate this book, as its title alone is somewhat offensive to me. Such, however, was NOT the case. This book is very thought provoking. To his credit, his first 2 chapters really do nothing but explain that the rest of the book will be offensive. I found that the only really offensive things were the adjectives he chose to describe the 'pro-God' authors he quotes BEFORE he quotes them. It became extremely annoying. (The quotes / arguments themselves were actually quite good.)<br />I think there is a majorly huge [incorrect:] assumption made at the outset. To Dawkins, there is science, and there is God. There is no in-between. I think this is just plain wrong, and I think it's sadly wrong, as the majority of Dawkins arguments regard 'keeping an open mind'. By disregarding any middle ground whatsoever, I think he, in essence, is closing his mind.<br />Another fallacy, I believe, is that he 'lumps all religions together' for the sake of his book. All religions are not the same. There are some religions that do not even believe in God, for crying out loud.<br />Dawkins major argument were 1) Where did God come from? and 2) Look at all the bad things religion has done. I would argue that the big bang theory has basically the same problem that the 'origins or God' does - ie - where did that first little speck of dust come from, that eventually became the big ball of matter that went BANG? Secondly - I am very much aware that 'Christians' through the ages, have done absolutely deplorable things. I believe we (Christians) are beyond that, in the same sense that Doctors no longer use leeches to bleed their patients to cure them of diseases. I believe science, as well as religion, has made massive strides in becoming both more knowledgable and more humane. - This is not to say the world doesn't still contain an enormous amount of evil, possibly in both categories. But to use this argument to 'prove' there is no God? It just doesn't fly.<br />I have discussed the 'bad' thus far. Overall, this is just a plain fascinating book.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|This CD struck me at once with its personal feeling and sentiment. Mark Knopfler seems a private person, but he is able to reach inside for a tender empathy he shares with us as few artists can, here, I think, more than ever.     There are Remembrance Day, So Far from the Clyde and Piper to the End (my favorites), all of which are sentimental and would have appealed to the home folk during the Great War - sort of in the \\"There's a Long, Long Trail a'Winding\\" vein. But they're not syrupy sweet renditions. They're insightful, intelligent, well-crafted and will tug at your heart strings and carry you away for awhile. Border Reiver is up tempo, moves well like the rolling Albion semi in the song. Cleaning My Gun is provocative with some fancy pickin'. You Can't Beat the House is a cool bluesy number. The only track that misses the mark with me is The Car Was the One, which seems a little trite.  As usual, his lyrics are poetry, often allegorical (particularly with So Far from the Clyde). As with Bob Dylan, he is a rare combination of skilled lyricist, master musician and composer, whose creativity has both surprised and satisfied. To me this CD is another masterwork in a series, maybe the best - that will take time to decide.      Mark's border country heritage is reflected throughout. There's a prominent but controlled Celtic flavor (do you remember My Darling Pretty?).    Again, as with most of his solo work, Dire Straits fans will not find here the raucous young lad with the blinding fingers. Mark still displays that side sometimes in his concerts, but his work now, like it or not, is more refined and subtle. I like it better now (even though Telegraph Road remains for me unbeatable. We could do with something like another Telegraph Road.) We're the same age, and its been good to listen to Mark over the years as he has developed.     In sum: If Killing for Crimson was good for you, you'll get into Get Lucky. And Mark, if you read these, your Chastain concerts leftus transfixed. Come back soon!

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have to be honest, for the last decade I have been pretty down on Whitney Houston due to her public decline thanks to her marriage and extensive drug abuse.  I would say I had lost my fan status.  However, after watching the candid interview Whitney Houston did with Oprah earlier this week, I rushed right out and purchased the CD.  I hoped I would not be disappointed and I am not.  I have been listening to the CD over and over and over again and am not tired of it yet.  It is a great mix of soul/r&b, contemporary ballads, and pop (the latter being primed for soon-to-be dance remixes).  Is this the Whitney of my youth who belted out \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" and \\"I Will Always Love You\\"?  No.  However, that is not the Whitney I want to hear... I've heard that Whitney.  She has been through a difficult (understatement) 10+ years and I do feel this a triumphant return for her.  Well done to the Clean, Sober, and Divorced (thank goodness!) Diva.  Welcome back Whitney Houston!!
B00003CXDD|4.0|The first film I remeber Val Kilmer in and he was cast just right. A scoundrel gone right type of deal.. It works good for his style of acting.<br />There's something for everyone in this movie, brownies for the kids, a few good guy fights with humor, as well as some romance for the ladies..
B001AQT0RC|5.0|It's 12 years since Contact hit our screens, if Titanic had of been released 12 months later Contact would've been up there in Lights as well,....well - Contact has always been up there in lights for me and continues to be in the top 5 of my list of films, Robert Zemeckis has treated Carl Sagan's story with respect keeping in mind a modern audience, if only Zemeckis had of done \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" how different it would've been!<br /><br />Anyway...I've been waiting for the Blu-Ray to be released, I'm looking forward to sitting back and enjoying the story unfold on my Hi/Def theater setup.<br /><br />Clint Jeffrey<br />Melbourne<br /><br />Post Script:- G'day to the two guys that left comments, Well I have my Blu-Ray, in nut shell it played well no problems, as you'd expect picture quality was totally acceptable, although I have watched some Blu-Ray movies that you can tell are really High Definition, sharp clean pictures where you can see the detail in the clothing the actors wear or the signs of age on an actors face, I didn't really pick that up with this release of Contact, don't get me wrong the Picture Quality was very good as was the sound, plenty of Base too, but I just felt the picture wasn't as sharp as I was kind of hoping, yet in some scenes you could tell an improvment in quality was evident, look...at the end of the day you're buying an improved version of this film, no doubt, and as a side note, I would love to see Zemeckis come up with a really good script in homage to Carl Sagan and come up with a story that follows on from where Contact finishes off....something that adventurous keeping special effects to a minimum, but a story that's scientifically as correct as possible thereby lending to being crediable, don't call it \\"Contact II\\" either, give the film a title thats different but at the same time clearly a follow on from Contact, and try to get Jodie Foster back too, I think that would be important.<br /><br />There, that's my three cents worth...I loved Carl Sagan and his work his mind, this Film is an extention of all he was about!<br /><br />Clint Jeffrey - 07/11/09his work his mind, this Film is an extention of all he was about!

0810993139|5.0|My 9 year old daughter begged me to buy this book, and I must admit that I was skeptical.  As a child her age, I preferred Nancy Drew and Little House on the Prairie books.  I have had little success getting her to read those series, or any other books for that matter.  So, I bought it.  She read it in 2 nights, loved it, and asked for the second book in the series.  We talked about how some of the content is pretty rude (discussions about passing gas, etc.) and she assured me that she would not be repeating it, but she thought the story was great.  So great, that she passed it on to her 7 year old sister who also proceeded to read the whole book in just 3 days!  Even though I prefer fine literature, I have to give this author credit for drawing kids in and encouraging them to read!!  I have purchased the rest of the series and will be pre-ordering the new book from Amazon.
B002KWLUU0|3.0|I suppose I am disappointed to a degree, although I wish my demo's sounded this great. Paddy is a masterful singer / songwriter, and these songs ( to a degree thematic ) are wonderful. Some of these have found their way onto other people's albums ( eg Wendy Matthews covered two of these tracks in the early 90's ). But I feel that a band is a sum of it's parts and Prefab Sprout is no exception. I am not sure of Paddy's intentions with this release, but the album definitely misses Martin, Neil and Wendy's contribution to the performances. Since \\" Andromeda Heights \\" the imitation drum, bass and general electronic sounds have been extremely prominent ( and the sounds on this album are very of their time ), and I can hear where Thomas could've taken this album. I feel this is only a glimpse of what could have been. After Paddy's masterful \\" I Trawl the Megahertz \\"....this feels like only half of the picture. Here's to a full band line up for the next record.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|In this short video you are given all of the joy, passion, love, anger, petulance, and stubbornness that were just a few of the many ingredients that made Bernstein one of the true musical geniuses of our age, or perhaps any age. We have far too few videos of Bernstein conducting in his later age.  Do not allow this one to escape you!
B002ELM5HY|3.0|First of all, I don't know any bigger MK fan than myself, that's why my bar for MK albums are so high. 'Get Lucky' he is getting too mellow that you might think his next collaboration is with Kenny G! Probably the nicest tune in this album is 'Monteleone' but this one is a great song for Nat King Cole! I feel MK is losing the rock edge or aging faster than me. To me he is still a beacon of classic rock and folk music.    I never understand the argument of people who try to separate Dire Straits line of art with MK solos. MK this is to you, I want my 'Walk of Life', My 'Heavy Fuel', my 'Done with the Bonaparte' back.
0385504225|1.0|Three years ago, Dan Brown and top executives in Hollywood and the publishing world assembled Thomas Harris, Dean Koontz, Michael Crichton, Paulo Coelho, Jimmy Wales, Abir Taha, and Rhonda Byrne in one room and said:<br /><br />\\"Hello and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight you are being tasked with creating a novel of epic proportions  - one that will keep multitudes of airline travelers mildly entertained for a few hours while simultaneously insulting the intelligence of anyone who possesses anything higher than a Bachelor's Degree in Communications.  Gripping intrigue; explosive revelations; multi-dimensional, original and sympathetic characters; realistic, cutting-edge technology; finely crafted and astonishing plot twists; meticulously researched detail - this book will have none of these!  Instead, randomly tear some pages out of your own manuscripts, staple them together and have the product on my desk by Tuesday night; we need at least a week to whittle down your blathering drivel into a 120 minute screenplay.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll be on the phone with Hanks' agent negotiating a deal where we send him a blank check, and he reciprocates his end of the contract by laconically intoning his dialogue while stumbling about in a tweed jacket, so just slide whatever you come up with under my door.  Remember, it's got to be at least 450 pages - if it doesn't snap the strap of a Timbuk2 messenger bag, it's not literature!\\"<br /><br />\\"Someone needs to throw in at least three dozen references to \\"things people do on the internet\\" too, please.  You know, just try to work in the words 'iPhone,' 'Twitter,' BlackBerry,' and 'Google' every ten pages, that way readers will know it's a taut techno-thriller.  And set it in Washington DC.  Yeah, like National Treasure 2. People liked that, didn't they?  Jimmy, have your boys just print out everything they have on the Freemasons, George Washington and Isaac Newton.  Yeah, I know we used him before; we honestly don't know any other scientists.  What do you mean your editors don't actually fact-check their information?  So it's all just a hodgepodge of hearsay and conjecture?  Actually, that's perfect.\\"<br /><br />\\"So, yeah, we have to have a love interest, too.  And by love interest I mean \\"woman with whom the protagonist has no chemistry whatsoever.\\"  I don't know, a beautiful, wealthy, impossibly intelligent woman who not only is involved in ground-breaking research in a scientific field that doesn't technically exist (but is going to change Everything Forever!) but also somehow gains the ability to make incredible leaps in logic minutes before our protagonist, thereby completely undermining the purpose of his entire character.  Which reminds me - we're going to need a villain, too.

What's that, Tom, you don't think so?  Good - run with that.  Throw in a plot twist about him too.  Something that's never been done before.  And how about some minor characters as well - an impeccably dressed black man who has keys that open every single door in Washington, an old blind priest who speaks solely in riddles, and oh, what the hell, a deformed, female chain-smoking Japanese midget with a gravelly voice.

Reading the Bible will teach you things. Things that every single human being alive already knows, but they don't know they know.  But once these things are pointed out, people are going to feel incredibly stupid that they didn't see them before.

Anything vaguely pyramid-shaped?  Just Google it, you'll find something. And make sure a shadowy government agency first tries to stop our protagonist, then ends up helping him using sophisticated technology that couldn't possibly do the things the book says it can do.

0393327345|5.0|I like most saw the movie first then read the book.  I'm a big fan of the movie and watch it often.  The book was a great read and although I own MANY books this is one of a few that I enjoyed.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of the DVD'S.  The way that they were in their individual cases was very good.  All of the extra information both on DVD and the written booklets was very informative and interesting.  They rivaled any that you would purchase individually at a retail store.
0545128285|3.0|The tales were cute in this little book. A very fast read. The additions written by Dumbeldore seemed a little unbelievable at times. Some of the asides he has just don't seem like him. Altogether this was a great little book to include with the series.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Ok how to said it with out yelling it out at home, it was fantasist!!! As a game lover and Final Fantasy one as that and one of my all time FF games is (of course) FFVII all of it Crisis Core, FFVII, Advent Children, and finally Dirge of Cerberus. My love for FF began with my first game Kingdom Hearts, Cloud was in it. I didn't know anything about the FF saga, but soon learn of it by my friend and gameinformer. The first FF game I own is FFVII. I played collect and beat the game.  When I hear that FFVII AC was coming out, I had to get it. That when my love for FF change to FFVII love. Before long DOC and CC was release, got them both baby! And my collection would not be complete with out an action figure of both Cloud and Sephiroth.         I know I know you all are saying, boy this guy is FFVII nut job. And proud of it!!! By the time FF Dissdia was coming out at gamestop I was overjoyed by this. Play as Cloud and other hero and villeins. That is the best game I play in my life, that and kingdom hearts and FFVII. Shortly after, I hear the FFVII AC was redone and made to a blu-ray movies, well that made my day. I could not wait to get it, but few thing got in the way of getting it. But finally, finally I now own the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Blu-ray movies and watch it on my PS3(yeah and proud owner of it). And as a fan I have never been so proud to be a FINAL FANTASY VII FAN IN MY LIFE!!!!!       Every single part of this movie I was yelling for joy. At the last part when Cloud fought Sephiroth I was thinking, how can the redo this part it was the fight in the house. Well as most would know( and if you haven't played or hear of FFVII Crisis Core you should be ashamed of yourself) Zack was the man that saved Cloud's life. When Cloud looked like he was going to lose, Zack showed himself to Cloud and said the same line that he said in Crisis Core. Thats when I filled out and stared to cry in joy knowing that it was a FFVII fan dream come true. The hole sagawas indeed completed.        When it was over I had to tell my review about this masterpiece of work. And if Square Enix or Tetsuya Nomura are reading any of this I like to say the they did a great job in making and completing FFVII saga.      Final Fantasy VII lives on!!!!    Chris, game/Final Fantasy lover.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Sons Of Anarchy is by far the best TV show on air today! Filled with bad boys, blood & bikes!!! The twists never stop twisting & the plot gets better with every episode. In the life or out, wearing a cut or a suit, rolling thunder or rolling in a cage, this show will grab you, throttle you & dump you along the road & you'll like it!!!!!!!    Long Live S.A.M.C.R.O.
B000089CPF|4.0|As good a balance of familiar and fresh found, from one of the only relevant Tex-Mex sounds around.

B000002LIX|4.0|Still a classic whirl of early alternative's best- a rousing mix of emotional balladry and thrusting rock aging like special projects do..with grace.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I loved this movie. The monster was amazing very cool and plus the little monsters were a great addition. Still the Blair Witch Project was better with the whole video camera thing.
0385504225|2.0|In Dan Brown's previous books he did a great job of blending history with the story at hand. This book felt more like two books forced together. You read some dialogue, then have to read a five page history lesson, then back to dialogue. I found myself zipping past the history lesson and looking for dialogue to at least follow just the story. It wasn't a horrible book, but not what I was expecting from Mr. Brown based on past experience with his prior novels. If you are new to Dan Brown, skip this and read his earlier works. If you have read the others, know that the story line is much like prior books, in fact at several points his main character even points out that the event at hand is just like events in prior novels. The ending is REALLY over long; ultimately I put the book down because I didn't care that the bad guy was out of the picture and why. The characters kept going on like a pack of kids with ADD. I just wanted to escape. The Symbol is lost; let's keep it that way.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|Baz has created a fable with this one... historical fantasy in a world down under. It is a fantastic movie, with great acting and a superb story, and the best looking Blu-ray disc of 2009. Buy it, rent it, see it - in Blu-ray if possible. And the music!

0385504225|2.0|I was expecting this book to be like Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code, an entertaining, diverting book for anybody willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. What a disappointment!     Now I know why the publisher refused to send critics advance copies of this book. The spoiler they were afraid of is that this is a very inferior version far more entertaining Da Vinci Code.    It looks like Brown decided to make a more money from his work on The Da Vinci Code by substituting a tattooed madman for the albino, the Freemasons for the Catholic Church, DC landmarks for European churches and then throwing in some pseudo science and new age spiritual drivel. Every plot twist is incredibly obvious. Is there anybody who hadn't figured out Mal'akh's identity long before this \\"surprise\\" revelation?    If this downward spiral continues, Brown's next novel will be set in Roswell, New Mexico and feature Robert Langdon racing against Darth Vader to discover the true results of the alien autopsy.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I'm sure not many people would expect a classic thrash/speed metal album to emerge in 2009, but I'm sure that \\"Endgame\\" will in time be considered a classic. Taking the speed and intensity of \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\", with the complexity and full-on shredding of \\"Rust In Peace\\", this album has a great sound that sticks true to its metal roots throughout.    This album has all you need to earn five stars. The loud, hard, fast and complex guitar riffs with the machine-gun drums, Dave Mustaine's signature vocals, intelligent lyrics and a FULL-BLOWN assault with the guitar solos. Between Dave and Chris Broderick taking lead guitar duties, this album shreds just as much as \\"Rust In Peace\\", if not even more. It's also got the talented songwriting of, say, \\"Countdown To Extinction\\".    From the blazing and seemingly endless amount of solos in the intro \\"Dialectic Chaos\\", to the frenzied assault of \\"Head Crusher\\", and the made-for-racing speed-metal of \\"1,320\\", this album delivers the goods. We also get a nice use of acoustic guitar and a strings section during \\"The Hardest Part of Letting Go...\\", which shows that Dave knows how to work the softer side of great music.    Well, there's not much more to say. This is a great metal album and shows that Megadeth is on top of the game. You can see that Dave and the gang worked at each of these songs, perfecting them to be the best possible. I highly recommend this to Megadeth fans and metal fans in general. Buy it, blast it, and let the music drive you \\"1,320\\" mph! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B002P1YEY0|5.0|Having read four of Dan Brown's novels, I was very pleased to see how much the author has grown as a novelist in The Lost Symbol.  In the DaVinci Code, I had actually found much of the flippant humor to be somewhat offensive and childish.  I think that the DaVinci Code was more beloved because of its controversy than its writing style.  In the Lost Symbol, there is very little use of slang, earthy humor, or sexual titilation.  This novel is very focused and carefully paced to make the reader want to KEEP READING!  The story all takes place in one day, which makes it even harder to put the book down for a day or more.  The characters are all wonderful, and the climactic ending is surprising, shocking, and painful (emotionally and physically).  Some readers might find the book to be too transparent in its structure, as it is obvious that Dan Brown planned out every chapter to be a springboard to the next.  Perhaps the author could have used a greater variety of techniques to build tension.  BUT, when I reached the end of the novel, I was very pleased with all that I had read.  I also felt that I had learned a great deal about the Masons and about the origins of many ideas, words, and myths.  Reading a Dan Brown novel is always eye-opening fun, and The Lost Symbol is a very good addition to this author's oeuvre.
1400076943|4.0|I've been hearing great things about Adichie's work for so long it's hard for me to believe that it's actually taken until just now for me to finally pick up one of her books.  Purple Hibiscus is my first Adichie read and it is a wonderful book, just like I've been hearing for years!<br /><br />I enjoy reading multicultural fiction because it usually introduces me to world events that I know very little about, or at least cultures that I'm somewhat unfamiliar with.  Purple Hibiscus is one of the few books (if not THE only book) I've read that takes place in Nigeria, and the novel definitely provided some of that cultural experience which I so appreciate in multicultural fiction.  The book deals with some of the details of Nigerian government and the ways in which those who spoke against the government were treated (badly).  More than that, though, this book is about Kambili - her family, her life as a teenager in Nigeria, and how she grew up over the course of the novel.<br /><br />What I loved about Purple Hibiscus is that Kambili is just like any other teen stuck in a family situation that isn't the greatest.  She has to deal with her oppressive, abusive father, and with her passive mother, and with navigating her way through life while trying to follow the rules her father (and her church) has set for her.  And generally speaking, Kambili deals with all these aspects of her life in the same kind of way most teenagers would - she handles it okay, but internally wonders when she'll be able to have a better, less restrictive life.  Also, she vacillates frequently between loving and hating her father.  Since her father is such a well-respected man in the community, Kambili is incredibly proud of him, proud to be his daughter and a part of his church.  Yet he is so abusive that she can't help but hate him too.  I like that Adichie showed Kambili having both feelings towards her father; it was incredibly realistic.  Most people who are abused still love their abuser - especially when he/she is manipulative like Kambili's father.  And as Kambili started to grow up a little more, she slowly started to see her father in a new light - started to realize the bad parts of him were more of his personality than she may have previously understood.  I loved reading about her transformation - not only in her feelings towards her father, but in her thoughts about her first love, her feelings on her other family members, and everything else.<br /><br />Purple Hibiscus was a very good novel, I could feel Kambili as if she was a real person, and the story was paced very well.  The secondary characters were interesting and complete and I felt like I got to know everyone in this book extremely well.  And Adichie's writing is simply beautiful.  I know I classified the book as Young Adult, but that's simply because the novel was in the YA section at my library - it could easily be enjoyed as a non-YA novel too.  I absolutely recommend this book and I'm hoping to read more of Adichie's work very soon!he/she is manipulative like Kambili's father.

0316044938|1.0|I didn't even want to give it 1 star.  I've never been so disappointed by a book in all of my reading experiences.  It captured my attention in the beginning but as others stated the characters were under developed and I felt that most were purely uneccessary to the plot, ie. Ray, Ruana, Ruth and randoms like Brian and Hal.  If she was going to include them they really should have had more depth but I saw no point in including them.  I felt no emotion for any of the characters accept for Lindsey, the father and the victim.    Mr. Harvey's upbringing did not seem to tie in with his motivation for raping and murdering women.  It was just too weak.  His character could have been more developed also.      I would have loved to view it as a murder mystery but there was no suspense as you found out right away who the murder was.      It really started to drag on and on with uneccessary details right around the middle of the book.  I just started skimming pages due to frustration.      Part of the interest in the book was finding out what happened to Mr. Harvey but information about him was loosely woven and he was barely and randomly mentioned towards the end of the book.  That was a blower.    I felt cheated when I read how Mr. Harvey died and just threw the book down.  I had no desire to read to the end.    Save your money.  What a waste.
0375714839|5.0|I had heard SO many good things about both Persepolis I and II, and for some reason I kept putting off reading them, so when I found this book at my library I finally just bit the bullet and took it home.  I was definitely nervous about reading it - first of all, I have very little experience with graphic novels, and secondly, I was very aware of my high expectations for the book based on all the positive reviews it's garnered recently.  I shouldn't have worried, though, because The Complete Persepolis was overall very enjoyable for me.<br /><br />I say overall because I have to admit that there was one thing about the book that bugged me - the writing was SO tiny!  I'm glad that this wasn't my first graphic novel, because I think I would have become frustrated with the genre if it was.  I had a difficult time sometimes reading everything that was written, and I think the black and white pictures also worked against my eyes - they were trying to take in so much, and some of it was really hard to see!<br />Besides that minor complaint, I thought the book was pretty awesome.  It was a highly educational experience for me - I really have no knowledge of this period of Iran's history (well, I don't have much knowledge of Iran, period), and to see these events through Marjane's eyes (with her explaining the history all along) was captivating.  I also was interested in the history for a personal reason - one of my uncles (by marriage) was born in Iran and didn't come to the U.S. until he was twenty-two.  In fact, I don't know his exact age but I think he came here at about the same time The Complete Persepolis takes place (late 1970's, early 1980's).  My uncle has a lot to say about his dissatisfaction with his native country's history, but I never truly knew the facts of that history.  Reading the book made me realize how ignorant I am about the history and culture of one person in my life who is very important to me.  It also made me want to learn even more about Iran's history.<br /><br />While I found Satrapi's story to be a great learning experience, I also found the book highly entertaining and very accessible.  Satrapi writes so candidly, so casually and at times hysterically that the reader can't help but understand her and sympathize with everything she's been through.  Also, she wrote the book in such a way that really made me want to be friends with her - she was seriously hilarious at so many points throughout the book, yet still so dead serious about the events that took place.  Really, the way she crafted her story was just lovely, and I pretty much loved every minute of reading it.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this one.  Even though I had a rough time with the physical act of reading the book, The Complete Persepolis was more than worth the strain it put on my eyes.  If you enjoy or want to try graphic novels, or like history, or like memoirs, read this book!history.<br /><br />While I found Satrapi's story to be a great learning experience, I also found the book highly entertaining and very accessible.

B002DKGWSO|3.0|I am happy with the picture and sound quality (enjoyed the movie on a 42'' plasma TV and a surround system), as it lives up to today's standards. So no complaints on this field and a clear \\"recommended\\". However the film... While I love gory splatter and horror, rape 'n revenge simply is not my favourite genre, as it awakens revenge fantasies in myself :) So if your faint of heart, you shouldn't do this to yourself. still, this version is much tamer than Wes Craven's original which left me with a very depressed feeling. This one: Well seen it, but not too many images from it will haunt my nights.
B001993Y2C|5.0|So ive seen a lot of reviews complaining about the packaging and what does or doesnt come with the box set. First the packaging is not the best ive seen, but for the most part its fine. Nice outter box, the cases for each season were done a bit cheaply.    However, the content makes up for the packaging. You get all 4 seasons, extras, extended and unrated episodes and the webisodes that aired online only. The season 1 package does also include the 4 hour miniseries. So everything thats ever aired and things that havnt. All and all a great HD set worth getting for any collector or avid sci-fi fan.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|This movie is about a teenager's dream, and seeing it now some 20 years after having been a teenager, of course it doesn't fascinate as before. While the effects were revolutionary then, today they look obsolete of course. But if you accept it's charme and ignore some stiff acting and a non-sophisticated story-line, it's plain fun and may rekindle some of your teenage dreams as well. I could listen to Craig Safan's main title music for hours after hours without getting tired, it is a wonderfult piece of (film) music. The Blu-ray transfer is clean and the picture looks fantastic on my 42'' plasma, and the sound has been re-mastered to a good quality. As I only had seen it on VHS and on TV before, I've never seen it looking better.

096798467X|5.0|I've owned this book for several years...been dying to make an earth oven since I bought this. FINALLY we got around to it this year and even though ours is a simple dome, the pizzas that come out of that oven are to die for. We've also made bread to rave reviews but have yet to do much more with it. It is worth it just for the pizza, though; you CANNOT get pizza like this any other way. Pizza stones in an oven just do not cut it.<br /><br />It probably took us about 20 hours all told to build our earth oven, working in teams of 2 over a period of about a week. We built a permanent base of concrete blocks for our oven, topped by firebrick and then the dome. It was well worth the time invested.<br /><br />I have a couple of minor criticisms of the book. First, it is a bit confusing on the whole \\"will your local earth work\\" to make an earth oven question. There's a way to test your soil by letting the layers of dirt and clay etc. precipitate in a glass of water - did not work for us. It showed a very low clay content. Yet we could do the squeeze test with the dirt (detailed elsewhere) and it appeared to be very clay rich. Anyway we ended up using our local dirt as is based on the squeeze test and observation of the dirt, just adding a touch of straw as directed and the oven turned out great. It will probably need patching or replacing in a few years but it does the job fine. Second, I found the instructions a bit disjointed when it came down to actually making the oven. It seemed I had to keep skipping around to find answers to different questions. If the author writes a new edition, I hope he will make the whole thing more linear.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, is that this is a fabulous resource and inspiration. I LOVE my earth oven and I kiss the feet of the author for spreading the word. :)<br /><br />Thanks, Kiko.
B001RIY49C|4.0|This is an excellent gift to anyone who thinks this is one of the greatest action movies ever. It's got 6 disc's the only difference between the version is the special features, the versions of the movies is the same. The bluray movie is excellent, the menus are quite interesting, it has certain touches that makes it better than the DVD versions. The endoskull is NOT as in the images, it made of shiny plastic and it feels a bit cheap, but it makes an excellent decoration for desks with the rest of your toys. It makes good noises too.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|After ripping this gem to hard drive some observations...    Windows Media Player 'Lossless' rips yield a better sound than iTunes lossless rips. (my computer is a pc, but there might be more to it than that...these aren't mp3 rips, they're bigger.    Good ol' Win-Amp plays the rips the best..as well as the CD playback in the drive. Everything is free online here. You can operate the CD player through the \\"Media Library\\" in the View tab in Win-Amp. There might be some extra Easter eggs for you there as well.    These boys went from love between the sexes to just becoming a State of Love. And they did it on a sonic roller-coaster...you're welcome to make the investment and hop on. I advise you give the ride a shot...every single album's worth, and experience their progress. They were Professionals without a doubt.    As for the mono/stereo discussion, NPR has a column with some short second mp3 examples...sometimes firing two speakers in sync has a more dramatic effect, but getting to hear Paul's bass seperately is a treatas well, so it's not a cut & dried conclusion. I found that NPR article through the Win Amp's Media Library panel and not Google. Lord knows I've been reading around for opinions on this re-release.    $200 for a competent theological course is not a high price to pay...life time guaranteed. As it's fun. Every commute should have Be-Till music going in their autos.    Thanks a quadrillion Amazon. I don't know how you did it but you did it. You sold me it on 9-9-09. Sweety-pi's.

B001993Y2C|5.0|This disc set includes all aired shows, including some extended versions which never aired.  It also includes deleted scenes for most every episode.  In short, there are so many extras, it is sure to keep everyone playing each disc over and over.    The RDM Battlestar Galactica truly set new standards as well as expectations.  The series has been unprecedented in so many ways, from the quality of directing, filming, sound and acting as well as the recognition, acknowledgment and awards received.  Some of those involved were even guests for a topic of discussion at the United Nations.    The entire series, as RDM notes in a brief introduction, was filmed entirely in HD format.  If anyone watched the series on the old television format, there is so much that one missed, no matter the quality of tele you had.  Watching the Blu-ray version is truly amazing as you will see so much more that previously would not have been seen.  It is literally like watching the entire series on the theatre big screen.    I highly recommend this Blu-ray edition.    So Say We All.
0743298039|3.0|This book tells the story of two women, Vida Winter a famous writer and Margaret Lea the biographer. Vida's story was interesting with lots of unusual characters and plot twists. Margaret's story on the other hand was really dull. Margaret spent the entire book obsessing over her twin that died the day they were both born. It got old for pretty fast.    Overall I found the book disappointing because it could have been so much better. The pace was fairly slow making surprising plot twists much less exciting than they could have been. Also the foreshadowing was so subtle at times some of plot twists really seemed to come out of thin air. Even though the story had all kinds of missing pieces this did little to increase the excitement. When a mystery was solved and a puzzle piece fell into place I usually was unaware there was even a piece missing. You can't anticipate finding out the truth when you don't suspect for a moment that you don't already know it.      Because of this, a book that could have been a five star can't put it down page turner, to me was a three star worth checking out if you've got nothing better to read.
B0017SXHR2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie,it holds your attention all the way.Great story great acting I only have one complaint VERY POOR QUALITY picture....I could hardly see especially the night sceans most dissapointing.I'll have to wait until it comes on TV to watch it again.A sad customer.
B001U7FWM8|1.0|I am someone else that sincerely wanted to like this cd. The reviews I had read and heard made it seem like it would be one I could listen to in my car stereo for a good long while without getting tired of it. Two Weeks was getting some airplay and I liked it. I am on my third listen and admit I really don't get it. Too much of it sounds randomly thrown together and incoherent. I like a lot of offbeat indie music but this cd is coming out of the car and going to the bottom of my bedroom cd pile. Guess I'll put The Decemberists back in until I hear something new on The Current I like more.

B000FIMG68|5.0|The first season drew me in. The crash, the mysterious surroundings of the Island, The black mist that seems to go after the survivors, the mysterious others, and then that mysterious hatch that just got it's lid blown off. We find out what that bright light came from, we discover that the hatch has a big surprise for those who want to venture in it.    The season begins slowly and drags on before things start to come into play. The character Desomond gets played out fully and tells them about the numbers that need to be punched in or something \\"bad\\" will occur. What gets me though is if this guy has been doing this for over three years, punching in the same numbers so many times a day, why isn't he suffering from loss of sleep? hmm....    We found out about the \\"Tallies\\" in which brings some more spice to the season. Michelle Rodriguez plays a great role trying to lead this band of survivors even though the deck was stacked against them a little more then the orginal cast. (she gets killed off too soon IMHO) The character that you will grow to hate quick is Michael. All of these elements keeps the show interesting. A stunning appearance also appears to viewers over the leader of the others.     The ending just screams for people to get the 3rd season. It dosn't quite has the cliff-hanger of the 1st season, but it does pave the way.
0385504225|4.0|As a longtime thriller reader, I've always had a healthy amount of respect for Dan Brown's talents.  The two Brown novels that feature Harvard symbiolgist Robert Langdon -- ANGELS & DEMONS and THE DA VINCI CODE -- are two of the most entertaining thrillers I've ever read.  Admittedly, neither book features first-rate prose or three-dimensional characterization; but they are both brilliantly constructed page-turners packed with fascinating tidbits about history, religion, and science.  They are almost impossible to put down once you start them.<br /><br />While THE LOST SYMBOL isn't quite as good as those two earlier novels, it's still a kick to read.  Brown follows his usual plot formula here (Langdon teams up with a female sidekick, solves puzzles, is chased around by the authorities and a two-dimensional villain), with only a handful of major variations.  But the formula is a reliable one, and this novel has the same delirious momentum that A&D and DVC had.  So if you enjoyed the prior Langdon novels, you will most likely enjoy THE LOST SYMBOL, although probably not as much, since Brown treads on so much familiar territory the third time around.<br /><br />Also, THE LOST SYMBOL is a bit heavy on New Age philosphizing.  Brown is clearly a humanist, but he tries hard here to express his humanist beliefs in a manner that won't offend organized religion.  The result is a series of preachy, oblique, and drawn out dialogues that slow the momentum of the story, especially toward the end. I found the ending a slight disappointment, although I do give Brown credit for trying something a little different.<br /><br />Overall, however, THE LOST SYMBOL is a solid sequel that delivers the goods.  It's a very well exected page-turner, one of the most entertaining novels I've read so far this year.  It is also WAY better than all the DA VINCI CODE knockoffs I've been reading over the past five years.  So if you're a Dan Brown fan, you should definitely pick this one up.  And if you're a Dan Brown hater -- well, this novel won't change your opinion of the man and his talents.-- well, this novel won't change your opinion of the man and his talents.

1400079276|2.0|On the advice of an author (her last name is `Hospital'). I started reading Haruki Murakami's novel \\"Kafka on the Shore.\\" She had advised emerging writers to read book translations from languages other than English to experience different voice. I had not read any of the novels by this author.  The book began on a high note. A 15 year old school boy runs away from his house and travels to another city in Japan. He hated school.  But I suddenly found another story starting in the next chapter. A group of school boys while collecting mushrooms in the forest lose consciousness for a while but then wake up fine. So I thought this book may have some element of science fiction. Or the author would come up with an explanation in some future chapter. But no explanation ever comes.  Then there is a third story of a cat talker. An old man dies in an apartment and a wriggling animal crawls out of his mouth. You never know what's the significance.  A ghost of a fifteen year old girl lives in the body of a 51 year old woman.  Two soldiers missing from World War 2 live in a forest without aging. In some other dimension there is a township inside a forest.  And there is some entrance stone which needed to be turned upside down.  Aren't all these things interesting? Reader continues to read because of the belief that issues will be connected and resolved in the end. And when it did not happen I felt cheated.(I finished this book to learn a valuable lesson of 'how not to write')  And you would think the three stories would merge in a coherent story at some point early in the book but doesn't occur till the end of the book.  This is a very poorly written book. Weren't there any editors to take a look at the prose before this book got published?  Let me go here one by one.  `I nodded' is a cliché. But is repeated so many (67 to be exact) times I got irritated. Another line in the dialogue repeated frequently is `Nakata is not very bright.' Well, readers are not suffering from dementia. Told once or twice, we would remember it, right? There is also a character that is shown to wear a Kunichi Football hat or take it off, all too often. It irritated me.  `Self-editing for Fiction Writers' says - And when you explain dialogue that needs no explanation, you're writing down to your readers, a surefire way to turn them off. There are many scattered examples of poor dialogue in this book. Here's an example:  `Yes, a little,\\" Nakata replied.  \\"Impressive all the same,\\" tabby commented.  \\"\\"My name is Nakata,\\" Nakata said, introducing himself. \\"And your name would be?\\"  \\"Ain't got one,\\" the tabby said brusquely.  And the improbable Kafka and Oshima (the librarian), both school drop outs discuss the kind of philosophy that would put Socrates and Plato to shame. Part of the latter part of the book feels like a kind of encyclopedia of music.  Another repulsive piece of scene was when 15 year old Kafka asks a 51 year old woman to have sex with him (he knows she could be his mother) and she obliges him by getting laid at night.  I was put off by this novel. Is there a possibility that this author's other novels might be good? I won't dare to find out.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|Kanye West's protege KiD CuDi finally releases his debut album proper (after releasing some mix tapes) and it is a sprawling ambitious project featuring CuDi's laid back sing song rapping style set to a bleak futuristic soundscape.<br /><br />A concept album of sorts, interspersed with narrations by Common and broken into five \\"acts\\", the album opens with the trippy sounding ballad \\"In my dreams\\" (\\"Welcome, you're in my dream now\\" says Cudi), followed by the woozy rap \\"Soundtrack 2 my life\\". \\"Solo dolo (Nightmare)\\" is a stripped affair that sounds bleak and beautiful, while \\"Heart of a lion\\" is a genty pulsing number, while \\"My world\\" is a dreamy melancholic sounding song laced with tender piano.<br /><br />The bleep-filled spooky sounding \\"Day N night (Nightmare)\\", the lead-off single has already hit the US and UK top 10 (and is also available in the excellent upbeat British-sounding Crookers Remix), while picking up the pace somewhat is the superb Kanye West produced \\"Sky may fall\\" (which reminds me of Kanye's \\"Welcome to heartbreak\\"). \\"Enter Galactic (Love Connection Part I)\\" is a galloping Disco-tinged song and is one of my favourites.<br /><br />\\"Alive (Nightmare)\\" features electronic music duo Ratatat and has a synth/Rock feel, while \\"CuDi zone\\" has techno-style strings set to a slowed down beat. \\"Make her say\\" is the current single and features Kanye and Common, as well as a sample from Lady Gaga's \\"Poker face\\". It sounds like a nursery rhyme set to \\"Golddigger\\"-style beats and it works. \\"Pursuit of happiness (Nightmare)\\" is another swirling synth/Rock number, this time featuring MGMT. \\"Hyyerr\\" featuring Chip tha Ripper is a string-swathed ballad that sounds like some seventies soul classic, and closing is the pulsing guitar-driven \\"Up Up & Away (The Wake & Bake Song)\\".<br /><br />Experimental, and accessible at the same time, I would say CuDi has more than lived up to all the hype. This album should shoot his star well into the stratosphere.
0385504225|1.0|I can't believe I got duped again.<br /><br />But I did and that is Dan Brown's unique talent, to just keep you coming back for more slop while he laughs all the way to the bank.<br /><br />The problem isn't that this is a formula book.  I enjoy MANY series that are really just formula for the most part, such as the Spenser novels, Stephen King, etc.  There's nothing wrong with sitting down every once in a while with something familiar, as long as its good.<br /><br />This just isn't good.  The plot is just series of events, the secrets are boring to anyone with more than a passing familiarity with the subject, the characters are just cardboard avatars.<br /><br />This just is a bad book.<br /><br />Don't be like me, be smart.  Don't waste your time.  There's better airplane fare out there.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|IMO- This cd from Porcupine Tree is good but thus far I'm not liking it as much as everything between Stupid Dream and Nil. I also feel it will be accessible for many.    Highlights- The Blind House, Drawing the Line, Time Flies. I also really liked Bonnie the Cat and Remember me Lover.     The only song I can say I really dislike is I Drive the Hearse.    Saw them last night at Seattle. Like someone said they played the entire 1st cd, along with Bonnie the Cat, and a couple songs each from Blank Planet, Nil, Deadwing, and Abstentia...and Russia on Ice. Crowd was at its loudest during Anesthetize. Check em out if they're coming to you.
1439138311|5.0|Having devoured Toibin's The Master last year, I picked this up at the library, knowing little to nothing about it. I found it a subtle and haunting narrative of a young woman who emigrates from Ireland to Brooklyn in the fifties. Won't say much else about the storyline, as it rather defies description. There is little external action driving the plot, and Eilis, the title character, seems less than riveting. Yet it would be hard to overstate the impact upon reaching the still but stunning climax, built up incrementally through the exquisitely inward course of the novel.<br /><br />Toibin is a master of nuanced emotion buried under the debris of culture and temperament, and over the course of the novel, the brilliance of what he is doing begins to dawn as imperceptibly as morning. When the denouement cleared the horizon, I was left stunned by its intricacy.<br /><br />Well worth a read for those who enjoy richly quiet meditations on personality and the large and small incidents that coalesce into a life.
B000MEPLY4|1.0|Let's see....50 pages, published by a music publisher - could this be a songbook? Stretching it a bit to call it a \\"paperback\\", very misleading. And for a hundred bucks? Nice work if you can get it.
0765356147|3.0|Sanderson set up one of the most remarkable and memorable stories ever conceived in the first book of the Mistborn Trilogy, an enthralling story that drew me in, aided in no small amount by his top-class writing skills. It is uncontestedly a story of the ages, but the final book ultimately does not live up to its vast potential. If it weren't for Sanderson's incredible prose, dialogue, and characterization, this would be a one-star book.  Sanderson has a remarkable story loaded with revelations and complexity, no doubt about that, but after the first book he began to trip up in the structuring of it. Though an excellent storyteller and wordsmith, Sanderson is not good at pacing a story and never has been. THE FINAL EMPIRE was unharmed thanks to an excellent, action-driven plot loaded with excellent characters. Starting in THE WELL OF ASCENSION, however, things began to go downhill. Sanderson began to focus less on character relationships and interaction, less on the overall stories and plots, less on the stellar themes, and more on politicking and the happenings our heroes face as they go about the world. In both these two last books, the story is barely present in the narrative until the final 150 pages, which is inexcusable late. Why do we have to suffer through the rather boring first halves of the characters wandering about to get to the good stuff? I'm not interested in gratuitous political dilemmas: I want to read about Allomancers and Kandra and prophecy twists and Ruin, and Vin and Elend fighting back-to-back against hordes of koloss and Inquisitors. I want to read about the events at the end of the world and the twists and turns that drive it. I want more story and less filler, okay?  I absolutely loved the story, dialogue, and characterization. However, I hated the decreased focus on Vin and Elend's relationship in favor of a political struggle with Yomen, a faith crisis for Sazed, and a sub-plot involving Spook, the former two being as boring as an old bowl of prunes and the latter not getting good until its conclusion.  The final sections, &#34;Beautiful Destroyer&#34; and &#34;Trust&#34; were filled with action and saturated with the story, and unsurprisingly were my favorite parts. However, it is kind of depressing when in &#34;Beautiful Destroyer&#34; Vin realizes who the villain is and that she needs to stop him. I wanted to just shout, &#34;OH, IT TOOK YOU THIS LONG TO GET STARTED?!&#34;  The climax was filled with everything from battles, to koloss, to Kandra, to battles between GODS. Unfortunately, the ending proved to be the worst part of this book. What. The. Hell. Sanderson! Did Ruin get a hemalurgic spike in you and demand that you change the ending to something much more depressing?  Perhaps it's a curse, and I came to love the characters too much. Perhaps the poor pacing was supposed to Balance out the excellent story and writing. The Mistborn Trilogy, despite the horrendous pacing, has been one of my favorite series, but the ending took all of my joy from the whole series and just totally flushed it down the toilet.  By the end of the book, nearly all of the characters are senselessly dead, and Sazed (who spends this entire book sulking and generally being useless) steps over their corpses to claim all the glory and the power for himself. The &#34;epilogue&#34; if it could be called that, is unduly short, little more than a post-script to confirm that everything turned out okay for the maybe 3 minor characters who actually survived the hell of the plot. I was disappointed, greatly. I felt depressed for days afterward, as if a family member had been murdered in front of me. Sanderson is holding the axe. Strange for a series that has always championed perseverence, survival, hope, and prevailing against all odds as its themes.  The Mistborn series had the potential to be the best fantasy series ever, but it fails to live up to that, though bad pacing and a horrific, senselessly tragic ending, reducing what would be a spectacular series down to something much less.  P.S. Marsh's ending was a complete letdown as well, especially considering how Sanderson had set up his character all through THE HERO OF AGES. And the revelation of who the Hero really was totally sucked.

0765317389|5.0|A book that benefits from multiple reads.  I read this book twice and year and find something new in it every time.  Makes me grateful for the choices I have in my life and hopeful that I will do better with them.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|Let me preface by saying that I have been a PT fan for a long time, and own every album.  Deadwing is probably my all time favorite album ever (PT or otherwise), and Futile, Mother and Child Divided, So Called Friend never leave my iPod.  But when it comes to this new album, I'm not ready to jump on the Fanboy wagon that most of these reviewers seem to be riding on just yet.  What is frustrating is that there are alot of remarkable ideas on here, things I would have like have seen evolve to an actual song.  There are some standouts, such as Time Flies and the title track,  but basically I get 14 really good ideas strung into a 55 minute track.  Maybe this one needs to sink in a little for me to appreciate it.  As with all PT albums, they do get better with time for me, but with Deadwing, FoaBP, even Nil, I liked them right off the bat and grew to love them.  Perhaps in a few months I will grow to like the Incident.
1601251505|5.0|I will assume that you have read through some of the other excellent reviews that give out the details of what you can expect to find in this tome.  I will merely echo what others have said: it's a beautiful book, the classes are now solid on their own (no longer needing to multiclass or aim for that better prestige class), and many of the confusing elements of the 3.5 rules have a newer (and hopefully less confusing) take.  Yes, it is a big book...it's like a combo Player's Handbook and DM's Guide, chocked full of goodness.<br /><br />But, here's what I've found thus far:  every single class is FUN to play.  I used to HATE playing the cleric.  Not only was I forced to just stand around and heal everyone, but the mechanics for turning undead made my head hurt!  With Pathfinder, however, I am not confined to healing and turning.  More spell-like abilities, and the Channel Energy ability (which replaces Turn Undead), allow me to play a very dynamic character.<br /><br />Likewise, playing a paladin was a love-hate sort of deal.  Now, paladins have quite a bit of moxie!  The \\"Smite Evil\\" ability has been beefed up, so evil beware!  In fact, every class has something new and fun introduced to it.  Sorcerors have bloodlines.  Wizards can bond with a familiar or a wand or staff.  Rogues now have \\"talents\\".  Barbarians utilize new rage powers.<br /><br />With each new campaign I join, I find myself eager to play a class I would have never wanted to play before.  So, sure, enjoy the new rules on grappling.  Wrap your head around the new skills system.  But, simply put, Pathfinder makes all the classes seem fresh, new, and exciting to play.
B002FOQY04|5.0|Kid Cudi has truly arrived with his debut album Man on The Moon: The End Of Day.  Kid Cudi was the subject of much hype this year after his contributions to Kanye West's 808's & Heartbreaks and when DAY N NITE became so successful.  Much weight was being put on his shoulders to not only become the next hip hop star but also to push the genre forward into boundaries it had never been.      Well I'm here to tell you that Kid Cudi has definitely delivered.  This album is everything a fan of hip hop and music in general could want.  This album is different sonically as well.  The sparse production, never overproduced, the use of silence and space.  The tracks are sequenced into 5 Acts to give the listener a feeling of a story being told but succeeds in creating a certain atmosphere that is unmatched.  That feeling is dark, moody, deep, futuristic and unique.  It's hard to exactly say why this album is so good but it really literally is GENIUS.  Kid Cudi also has great lyrics.  Some people may not feel his lyrics because they only pay attention to technique but he drops lyrics for the mind about life, feelings, emotions etc that grown people can relate to.  The album is very mature and wise beyond his years.  Kid Cudi combines a unique flow and delivery with a semi-singing/talking approach that works extremely well for him.      Man on The Moon: End Of Day is a crowning achievement and one of the best debuts in recent memory.  Sonically the album is amazing (reminds me of ATLiens), Cudi has perfected his style.  The album creates an atmosphere from the unique album cover and presentation of the album to the movie-esque back cover.  He takes us on a journey with his music and is one of the rare times when an album is more enjoyable as an album rather than a collection of songs.  What I mean by that is that the individual songs are great indeed but the sum is greater than it's parts.  This album should be enjoyed and listened to straight through (like a movie...) to fullyappreciate its creativity and purpose.      I HIGHLY recommend Kid Cudi's debut album as it is undoubtedly and easily one of the great albums of the year.  Standing Ovation.  Instant Classic.    *also included is a poster,DVD, and lyrics inside the book.  The DVD is decent...nothing really noteworthy or prolific about it...just a bonus DVD.  Also I bought mine from BB and there aren't any bonus tracks on the cd as it suggests on the cover...a big FAIL for the deception and whichever goofball messed up is fired or should be*
B0025KVLTM|5.0|OVER THE '87 RELEASE.  that's what the 'powers that be' promised, and they delivered.  if you can't hear much of a difference between the 'old' and the 'new',  i would recommend purchasing a better stereo system.  the better the system these new cd's are played on, the more noticeable the improvements:  crisper highs, more detailed low end, mid range to die for. also, i noticed no clipping  of sound due to compression. these cd's were not over-compressed as stated by some, who i doubt even listened carefully, if at all.    oh yeah, one more thing, if you still think that the only difference is that the new remasters are louder and nothing else, you may also want to get your hearing checked out.    great job by all concerned; and it also proves that when produced correctly, cd's are still a great medium to store music.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|I've been reading the 3 star and negative reviews of this remastered and re-edited  version and although they make some good points, I feel they are somewhat unfair. Compared to the movie, these edits are actually longer. And errors that are on the video soundtrack are now mostly corrected.      I noticed someone commented that Jimmy disrespected J.P. Jones by leaving off Robert's \\"John Paul Jones, piano\\". That was edited out of the original movie as well. I think it would be a good idea to also remaster the original LP release.
B000A2H8WQ|5.0|Although it may sound dated now with all its synthesizer brass sections, you have to remember that it was recorded in 1989, and back then the sounds were top of the line.    The fact that Quincy's been able to pull off a COHERENT album with a cast that includes an ASTOUNDING group of talent from various genres is an achievement not rarely (if ever) seen since. I'm surely forgetting someone, but at least: Rappers Ice-T, Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane...R&B singers Barry White, El DeBarge, Al B Sure, James Ingram, Barry White, Siedah Garrett...Jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn...AND jazz legends Miles Davis (!), Dizzy Gillespie, George Benson and Herbie Hancock!     Actually, despite the fact that it won the Grammy for Album Of The Year, Quincy was still criticized for not fully taking advantage of all the potential those star musicians had. Personally, I don't know what they are talking about...like I said above, it's an incredible FEAT as it is.     And besides, the music is SUPERB! Not only putting the star studded cast together, Quincy blends pop, r&b, jazz and hip hop AND has traditional jazz singers like Ella Fitzgerald exploring something completely different.    Kudos to you, Mr. Jones, always a personal hero of mine.

B0024FADDI|3.0|This is a review on the Blu Ray edition of this. 5 stars for the movie and the remastering, the picture looks alot better than all previous editions (which are many) 3 stars for the content. There are barely any extras, no audio commentary, deleted scenes and no directors cut (which is shameful since they can fit so much more content on blu ray discs. This edition is good enough until they release this yet again with the directors cut, whenever that may be.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This is Whitney pure and simple.  Thank God for changes and the talent to handle them well.  You know the way Whitney sings along and then just handles a beat all of a sudden? It is all here. The dip and the dive. The musicians never have to play over Whitney like some vocalists. Never have. She finds them and just lands when they do.  That has always been her special quality, not the upper register. It just makes you want to move in the right direction. The cd swings. Do yourself a favor and get this cd. It is Whitney alive and telling you about it.
0307454541|1.0|I was so excited to meet the title character, Lisbeth Salander. What a great character, one hardly ever written in fiction--a brilliant, sensitive, yet fierce alt young female computer network security geek. LOVED HER! And what terrible treatment she got at the hands of this author. The plot is cliched, to be sure, but the worst was the waste of this character and the horrible sexual violence in this story. As a mother and a woman, I am completely shocked this is a mainstream bestseller. I threw my copy in the trash. Literally.<br /><br />This reminds me of a manuscript I was asked to critique many years ago. It was written by a man I knew in his fifties. All the female characters, young and old, fell for his main character, who was--surprise!--a man in his fifties. And there was plenty of sexual violence in the female characters' background so that they were good and kinky by the time he got them, and what a pleasant shock he found it to be. It was embarrassing having to give feedback to this guy. I told him I couldn't possibly recommend his book to any self-respecting human with a beating heart and an intact soul.<br /><br />Someone should have given some honest feedback to this author. Publishing's marketing machine has lost what shred of crediblity it ever had with me.<br /><br />Horrible.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I love Muse, and I have to side with the fans who call this a masterpiece. The only song I didn't absolutely love on the first listen is 'Guiding Light'. In my opinion, this is the only weak point in the entire CD. It just lacks the complex depth I adore from this band. I am not saying I don't like it, and over time it may grow on me, it just is not the best Muse song ever. That said, I love the anthem rock of 'Uprising', 'Resistance' has the Muse hallmark of starting out as one song, but totally turning around at the chorus. Regardless of the negative reviews, 'Undisclosed Desires' is an amazing song! What is R&B, or Britney Spears about this song?! I understand the beat is catchy, but the strings, the electronic overvoice in the chorus, and the passion in the vocal delivery make this a beautiful song! I love the vocal harmony within the final chorus. On first listen, I thought 'United States of Eurasia' was kind of strange, but it is so funny, and so truly over the top, it may become my favorite song! The piano solos are genius and the way Matthew Bellamy says our heros have all turned to dust just cracks me up! I think it is brilliant. 'Unnatural Selection' rocks! I love the way the begining sounds like something from \\"Phantom of the Opera', then the guitar just rips the whole track wide open. THIS is Muse! It rocks to 'counter balance the commotion'. 'MK Ultra' is also as much a classic Muse song as 'Plug in Baby', or 'Fillip', just a natural progression. I love it. The minor key shifts and build up of the chorus are excellent. \\"I Belong To You' is pure entertainment! I love the stomping piano riffs, and who uses a clarinet in a rock song? The thing that cracks me up is rhyming Leo and Rio. Muse want you to get this! It doesn't have to all be so serious all the time! The French opera is a true testement of just how brave our guys are, and a perfect lead in to the true soul of this album. There are really no other words to describe the three movements of the Exogenesis Symphony than utter genius. The music is flawless and the vocals are hauntingly beautiful. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said these three pieces, I can not bring myself to just call them songs, are reason enough to buy this CD. In a time when most popular music sounds like it was churned out of a factory, this is brave and wonderful.  'Redemption' is the answer to the question 'Why can't we start it over again'. Maybe we can't, but I believe it is worth the effort. This CD is also worth the effort; just but it, you won't be disappointed!enesis Symphony than utter genius.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|When I first opened this set, I put in Rubber Soul and skipped over to \\"In My Life\\", a track whose stereo mix relegated the confessional, thoughtful Lennon lyrics to the far right of the mix. After the first 4 bars, it struck me: I was hearing the Beatles for the first time. Warm, balanced, and intimate, the whole album ironically took on new and fuller dimensions when compared to the stereo mixes I'd grown accustomed to. The Beatles mixed most of their music primarily for mono, and the differences can be revelatory.    It's often amazing to hear the different life a song can take when comparing the mono and stereo mixes. An intimate song in mono can sound detached in stereo. An expansive song can sound cluttered in mono.    So which mix wins out? Ultimately, it comes down to the listener to decide; oftentimes the choice is clear (Rubber Soul, most of Revolver, most of Sgt Pepper are better in mono) and sometimes it's a mixed bag. Luckily, the mono and stereo sets are both beautifully made and sound gorgeous.    I also can't say enough about how beautiful a package this set is. And that alone nearly makes it worth the price of admission.    If you're a serious Beatles fan who cares a lot about the musicality of the songs, then by all means don't hesitate to pick up this set. It looks and sounds fantastic.    Oh and one last tip.  Make sure you volume correct when you compare the stereo and mono remasters, as the stereo mixes are generally louder.  Studies have shown that anything played louder tends to sound better, when it's not necessarily so.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|The \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" recording was released in the U.S. in November 1967. It was comprised of six songs on the A-side from the one hour TV movie that aired in the same year, and five more songs on the B-side which consisted of both sides of the three singles released in 1967, except for \\"I Am the Walrus\\" which was already on the A-side. The A-side includes \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"Fool on the Hill\\", \\"Flying\\", \\"Blue Jay Way\\", \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", and \\"I Am the Walrus\\", and the B-side includes \\"Hello Goodbye\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\", and \\"All You Need is Love\\". All songs are by John Lennon or Paul McCartney, except for \\"Blue Jay Way\\"(Harrison), with all members contributing on \\"Flying\\". With \\"The Magical Mystery Tour\\" musical experimentation continued for the Beatles from their previous, and critically acclaimed \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" recording. In what is known as the psychedelic period of the Beatles their experimentation reached a peak in songs like \\"I Am the Walrus\\", and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and \\"Flying\\".<br /><br />1967 was a time of transition from mono to stereo in recording history. Songs like \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\", and \\"All You Need is Love\\" were presented in fake \\"processed\\" stereo on the original LP. Mono was the standard of the time, though within two years mono would become more or less obsolete. The Beatles would eventually adopt only stereo for their later recordings, like \\"Abbey Road\\", and \\"Let it Be\\". When this album was released for compact disc in 1987 it was released with true stereo recordings replacing the earlier processed ones. This remastered CD is made from the original stereo analogue master tapes. The recording is great except for a few sections when I listened to them with headphones. Sometimes I found it distracting to hear the absence of sound in one ear and then suddenly have it filled with an orchestra or instrumental section. When this did happen it usually occurred near the beginning of a song. Otherwise, this recording is clear and crisp, and a wonderful addition to the Beatles library. Except for the cover, this ranks as one of my favorite Beatles recordings because of its novel and high spirited songs. \\"The Magical Mystery Tour\\" reached number one in the U.S. and was even nominated for a Grammy award for best album of the year in 1968.<br /><br />The CD comes with a booklet of history notes, and also a replica of the 28 page comic/booklet that accompanied the original recording as well as a mini documentary that can be watched on a computer.it usually occurred near the beginning of a song.

B00197X140|5.0|To many pre-existing fans of this band like myself, the announcement of an acoustic reworking of previous material may not cause them to run out and buy it immediately; after all, what we're all waiting for is the highly anticipated new album that's been six years in the making. So, in hindsight (pun intended), I can see I (and perhaps some others) was foolish enough to pass this record up until I decided to listen to it today. What a mistake to let this one go til now.    This isn't a simple re-recording of previous material, but rather a more focused, well produced, and better performed rendition of some of Anathema's best songs. You could say its a best-of collection (which is fine because this band doesn't have one and certainly deserves one), but its more than that - the maturity and growth in all aspects of their craft Anathema has seen up to this point are utilized to recreate these songs to incredible effect. In short (if I may be so bold), this is the way these songs should be interpreted, because as great as these songs were originally, they're even more moving and thought provoking this time around.    As for how it was advertised as an acoustic album, after listening to it I can say that its not quite. There's use of synthesizers, some vocal effects, and a bit of studio magic that help the songs blossom to their full potential. But perhaps the greatest aspect of this record is not just its consistency, fluidity, and improved production, but the way some of the arrangements have been tweaked and improved upon to help the songs flow, impact, and translate better. Add to this fact that all the vocalists have increased their talents since the original recordings, and you have perhaps a masterpiece of mature and emotional audio cinema, an honest and well wrought expression of the human condition. The songs \\"Angelica\\" and \\"A Natural Disaster\\" are worth it for the price alone, not to mention the rest of these cuts.    This is the best reinterpretation of previous material I've heard from a band since Pain of Salvation's live acoustic \\"12:5\\" record (which is standard listening, as well) and is a mandatory musical experience for any music fan, including (and perhaps especially) Anathema fans. Again, don't overlook this record - you'll be missing something truly special.    JKM 9/2009

B001O8C5KK|2.0|I finally got this recording of Butterfly and after reading all these reviews I can only assume that these people are paid employees of EMI.  I know it's the first Butterfly in a long while but, for anyone who has heard and enjoyed Scotto, Price, Freni or Callas this recording is going to be like standing at a street corner waiting for the light to turn green.  When is something going to actually happen ? Gheorghiu sings with no portamento...none.  I find it incomprehensible that she actually sings Puccini without the proper style.  She sounds like a music teacher counting notes.  Jonas Kaufmann is nice but Pavarotti, Bergonzi, Bjorling, Domingo even Tucker...all aquit themselves better. Pappano can't even touch Barbarolli, let alone Karajan. The people writting these reviews have no CD collections.
B001IA51Y6|4.0|Since nobody has reviewed this yet, guess i'll be the first.  This dvd is pretty sweet.  It could have been much better though. It includes a video for N.O.D. and these Down songs below were either played live or in sound check on here.  \\"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\\", \\"Learn From My Mistake\\", \\"Lysergic Funeral Procession\\",  \\"There's Something On My Side\\" and \\"The Path\\".  I'm at work now so I don't remember which 2 vids had the terrible footage.  Overall its a great dvd minus the bad footage.  But since its Down's only official dvd out now, this is pretty sweet!  I'm ready for an official Down concert dvd!!!!!!!!!
0316044938|5.0|A wonderful story narrated by the murdered victim... I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it. Not your typical gory serial killer fiction. It was heart wrenching & taught us that it's not only the dead who endure pain but also the living who suffers with the aftermath of losing someone.
0201633612|2.0|This book reminds me why I hated school so much, despite my innate love for programming.  It is bland, boring and outdated.  If it had pictures in it, I would have drawn mustaches on all the people.  There is nothing about the way this book is written that engages the reader and makes them want to read more.  The examples are outdated, and don't directly apply to developers using modern languages like C#/Java.  I mean using sub-classing for method callbacks is one such example, gimme a break.  With that said, this book I'm sure was groundbreaking when it was written when a lot of this stuff was not well known.  However, being a programmer of the modern age, most of these patterns are intrinsic and intuitive. Most of these patterns I've used throughout my career, I just didn't know what they were formally called.  So, if you want a book that puts a name with the common patterns you normally use day to day, by boring you to death in the process, then this is the book for you.  If you are a teacher and want to fail your whole class and discourage them from pursuing CS as a major, then this is definitely the book for you.

As a 14 yr entering high school this event was a defining moment in my life.<br /><br />This package gave my a chance to see and understand how much people can work together to make the best of a bad situation. It brought the memory of the day my friends and I went to see the movie - we stand in line for four hours waiting for the first showing in our area.<br /><br />I loved the bonus disk especially the music performers not show in the movie.<br /><br />Groovie Man
B001UXJQHE|5.0|I have several of Andre's performances and this one is the most spectacular of them all. There is a huge entertainment factor. Andre has gone from a basic orchestra show to one including several added performers and amazing backdrops. The reproduction of an Austrian castle was unbelievable. Andre always includes some local performers and traditions that get the audience deeply involved in his performance. This performance is one to see and hear. You will remember it for a long time.

0743455967|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! The first part of it focuses on his life and the things that happened in his life that helped shape him as an author. The rest of the book gives you great pointers with your own writing and inspires you to just get to work. I've read many other books on writing before, but most of them focus too much on the basics, which should have been covered in high school English courses. King only tries to inspire you and let you in on a few of his own tricks that he's learned mostly through his own experience as a writer. His style of writing almost makes you feel like he's in the room with you, just having a casual conversation, and not like he's lecturing you in some boring writing class. I definitely recommend this book for any aspiring writer, but remember practice, practice, practice is the only thing that will help you improve. Mr. King's own words.

0743496736|4.0|19 Minutes affected me greatly. School violence is a problem which we hear about often. 19 Minutes presents teenagers and their problems and issues in a very natural, very realistic way.<br /><br />When Peter, a young boy who has been bullied all of his life for no reason, walks into his high school with guns he shoots 29 people, killing 9 of them, a nightmare scenario no one thought possible happens. For Peter this was part of a detailed premeditated plan. This whole rampage took 19-minutes.<br /><br />The character I feel for is Josie, the judge's daughter, Josie seems to be a victim of mixed signals and miscommunications all the way through. But it might have made a real difference if her mother had just once been able to get through to her and listen more before it was too late.<br /><br />Very moving story. Jodi Picoult has done it again  Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant
B000001DQG|5.0|Classic Elton John compilation at its best. \\"Caribou\\" includes two major hits by Elton from the 70's: \\"The Bitch is Back\\" and \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.\\" The other selections are great as well, which makes listening to the entire album a very pleasant experience indeed. I recommend this product highly for all Elton John and 70's music fans.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This is real Beatles stereo. This 2009 remaster removes (finally) the heavy tape hiss from the overdubs of the original recording on \\"Oh Darling\\" and \\"I Want You\\"; the cartoonish bass lines on \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Maxwell's\\" are so strong that they are almost a distraction.     The other Beatle albums are better in mono not because of the format but because their artistic choices are in those mixes; Martin changed many of them on the stereo mixes, really marring what was intended - particularly on \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\". Same situation as Hollywood executives who know better than the directors and 'fix' everything. The Beatles had become aware of this by the time of \\"Abbey\\" so you have no alternate French or German or US Capital mixes, and the stereo choices are the same as the mono choices. Yes, there is a mono \\"Abbey\\", issued in South America, and there are mono takes with mono matrix numbers. It should have been finished (as four singles' mono versions were from \\"Yellow\\") and issued in the mono box; it was slightly superior to the stereo comparing the LPs of the time. If it was a 'folddown' as claimed, it was a successful technique; that wouldn't explain the mono matrix track numbers. On \\"Abbey\\" they didn't leave the studio apparently, they kept their eye on the stereo version, unlike their other LPs with Martin. There was one major difference in the mono LP, again belying the 'folddown' statement - \\"Her Majesty\\", the coda, is much lower sound, making the singer/character seem much shyer. It passes like a wisp of air on that release.    This is a model for what the remaining Beatles/estates should do - make stereo mixes preserving their mono artistic choices. I doubt they trust each other enough to do it. But the mono issues - the \\"Sgt.\\" mono should be the standard issue - are wonderful and superior. This \\"Abbey\\" belongs with them, since the mono version isn't going to be issued.
0060989157|5.0|First off, let me lay my cards on the table - I'm not a Motley Crue fan and although I've heard a smattering of their songs and what I have heard I don't remember much of apart from the chorus of \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\". This is no reflection on the band, you understand - its just that they apparently didn't get as much media exposure in the country of my birth as they did in the US.    What I am, however, is as much of a fan as anyone else of that scaborous 'warts and all' genre of 'faction' known as the rock biography and in that regard, \\"The Dirt\\" delivers in spades.    Chronicling the rise to fame and spectacular implosion of the original line-up of Motley Crue through interviews conducted by Neil Strauss with the various members of the band (Nikki Sixx, Vince Neil, Mick Mars and Tommy Lee), we are treated to alternating viewpoints on different (and sometimes the same) events and in some instances its almost impossible to discern which version of events is the closest to the truth or, indeed, whether any of them are remotely related to anything like reality given the bad blood, wounded egos and voluminous substance abuse involved.     The dysfunctional rock band has become something of a cliché in the last forty years and in MC's case, it has almost been elevated to an art-form; the group is so full of contradictory personalities, barely suppressed anger and festering animosity that one wonders how they ever managed to spend ten minutes in the same room together, let alone persevere long enough to forge a career and release albums. If two words sum the band up, they would be \\"conflict\\" and \\"addiction\\". Conflict with each other, with themselves, and with everyone and everything else and addiction to their very own personal hells: For Sixx, it's nihilism and Heroin; Mars' drugs of choice are despair and alcohol; Neil's personal poisons are women and fast cars, and Lee's seems to be a schmorgasboard of all of the above. Suffice it to say, if the copious amounts of drug abuse related here are not attempts at self-mythologising then it's a miracle that any of the band are still alive today. I don't think I've read a book that features as many drug overdoses, encounters with unwashed groupies, car crashes or spousal abuse as this one. People expecting a laugh-a-minute tale of John-Belushi-in-\\"Animal House\\" style high-jinks will no doubt be shocked by the depths to which Nikki Sixx sank during his love affair with the needle. Even without their sundry addictions it seems that, with the exception of Mick Mars, who I developed a sympathy and grudging respect for, the majority of the band are not really very nice people. I enjoy a tale of debauchery as much as the next man, but the passage in which they describe picking up a homeless, mentally disturbed girl from the streets of LA, having sex with her, and then sending her back out onto the streets with her clothes in tatters and tears streaming down her cheeks was nothing less than repugnant.       A shocking, compelling insight into minds deluded by their own talent and the accolades of others, \\"The Dirt\\" may well be one of the greatest rock biographies ever written and is highly recommended as a cautionary tale of how not to go about enjoying success.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|With all of the Beatles' music being remastered and rereleased a week ago, it seemed like the time was right to start listening to them.  I chose Sgt. Pepper's for no reason in particular other than liking some of the songs already, and I predictably liked it a lot.  It's sort of a failed early attempt at a concept album. The idea is that the Lonely Hearts Club Band is a real group and the album is a recording of one of their concerts, but that only comes through in the first two tracks and the second to last.  Other than that, it's just a nice collection of songs; four by John, one by George, and the rest by Paul.    I've heard a lot of these songs before, but the ones I haven't are enjoyable too.  Even simple, somewhat dopey songs like \\"Fixing a Hole\\" and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" have interesting elements to them.  \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\", the only track sung by Ringo, is good for getting into the mood of the album proper after the opening title track, and it was a revelation when I realize Joe Cocker covered it in The Wonder Years theme song.  I'm not convinced \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" is really about drugs, but either way it's a nice, trippy little tune.  I don't have to talk about \\"Getting Better\\" because it has to be in a commercial every year by law.  George's \\"Within You Without You\\" is a unique track, infused with an Indian sound that serves as a nice breather in the middle of the album.  \\"She's Leaving Home\\" was the best surprise of the songs I hadn't heard yet, and \\"A Day in the Life\\" is pretty much the perfect closer.  Every song transitions smoothly into the next, and it's just a really easy to listen to collection of songs that comes together really well into quite a good album.  I'm not sure it was the perfect jumping on point for the band, but I don't think it was a bad one.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Man this album is heavy. The only one by them I've liked since Peace sells... Real vintage 80's metal sound. That lead on Bodies sounds vintage Adrian Smith Maiden. Rock on Dave.     I kind of wish he would re-record Killing is Business with this guitar sound. Those songs were metal at its finest.
1416583408|4.0|After having read this book weeks ago (advanced copy), I was left a little unsatisfied. I'd give it 3.5 stars if could.    It's more of a cursory glance at canine cognitive ethology rather than a definitive volume, but if you're looking for a good introductory to canine cognitive ethology, this would be a great starter. The anecdotes are sweet and the science is pretty good, and written in a way that the regular Joe Dog Guardian can read it without breaking his brain.    HOWEVER. There is one VERY glaring \\"scientific\\" experiment that I feel she used for a bad conclusion, a conclusion whose inclusion of the flawed scientific experiment betrays the entire premise of the book itself.    In the section on \\"Hero Dogs\\" (dogs that have responded to emergencies and saved the lives of their owners and people in general), Horowitz details what she calls a \\"clever experiment\\" with dogs where    \\"owners conspired with the researchers to feign emergencies in the presence of their dogs, in order to see how the dogs responded. In one scenario, owners were trained to fake a heart attack, complete with gasping, a clutch of the chest, and a dramatic collapse. In the second scenario, owners yelped as a bookcase (made of particleboard) descended on them and seemed to pin them on the ground. In both cases, owners' dogs were present, and the dogs had been introduced to a bystander nearby--perhaps a good person to inform if there has been an emergency.    In these contrived setups, the dogs acted with interest and devotion, but not as though there was an emergency...    ...In other words, not a single dog did anything that remotely helped their owners out of the predicaments. The conclusion that one has to take from this is that dogs simply do not naturally recognize or react to an emergency situation--one that could lead to danger or death.\\" (pp.239-240)    I really don't understand how she could have come to this conclusion after having written over 200 pages on how a dog sees, smells and relates to its world (the \\"umwelt\\" of a dog). She didn't consider that the dogs knew that their owners were faking? She wrote herself that a dog can sense the most minute changes in a person's own body chemistry, right down to sensing cancer and other things like an increase in heart rate or adrenaline. A person faking a heart attack isn't going to have the same body chemistry/physical changes that a person having a REAL heart attack is going to have, so in a sense--there is no faking a heart attack around your dog (believe me, I've tried, LOL--it was only playing/testing, but none of my dogs seemed to care if I plopped over in bed, \\"dead\\"). Same goes for adrenaline levels when you're in immediate danger, like when you're drowning (and I believe this was one of the examples she used just before this horrible \\"deduction\\" of hers; a dog saved the life of a child that was going to drown). And if a person was faking being hurt under a particleboard bookcase, I'm pretty sure that the dog could sense that, too.    Anyway. That was the only part of the book that REALLY got me going \\"Hmmmnnn...no.\\" Other than that, it's a good read, but left me wanting more (a whole lot of it sucks you in, but then you're left with a little bit of an unsatisfied thirst for more science and more talk about how dogs are in the world; the end chapter seemed a little rushed to me, too).
0312944926|5.0|My dad used to work at NSA and this book thrilled me from the start.  I don't like everything Dan Brown has written, but this one was fun to read
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The Lost Symbol is an engaging page turner, as long as you don't think too much as you read. Brown's grasp of history is reasonably, but neither deep nor insightful. The plot is exactly as you'd expect, with entertaining plot twists roughly where you'd expect them. Still, the book is enjoyable and a light read.<br /><br />The Kindle edition sells for roughly the same price as a theater ticket to a summer blockbuster. While the forgettable blockbuster will entertain you for two hours, Brown's book will probably take you more than ten hours to read. On that basis alone, the book is a good value.<br /><br />For people who prefer some depth to their literary entertainment, consider Neal Stephenson, a master of esoteric science fiction. Either [[ASIN:B000FC11A6 Cryptonomicon]] or [[ASIN:B000FBJCJE Snow Crash]] provide an excellent introduction to his multi-layered work. If you prefer to discover real secrets, consider the excellent [[ASIN:B001VT3L00 Archimedes Codex]]. Finally, Umberto Eco's [[ASIN:015603297X Foucault's Pendulum]] is one of the greatest conspiracy novels of all time.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Someone needs to tell SOLDOUTTICA to start ripping Dave Mustaine off.  While the wheels have completely fallen off the once proud icons of metal, Dave just keeps getting better and HEAVIER with age.  One thing I appreciate about Dave is he chose not to go down the AC/DC road and release records that could be interchanged for each other.  I am one of his original fans who even enjoyed his departure from thrash in the 90s for a more \\"melodic metal\\" approach and was thankful he never released an \\"alternative\\" record during that bleak era like the aforementioned has-beens.  That era aside, I, like most of his hardcore fans, absolutely love his return to a heavier sound.  The guitar work on this album just smokes and the production is top-notch!    I smile on the inside knowing Dave continues to issue a musical shellacking over his ignominious former band mates.  \\"Endgame\\" was like dropping a musical nuke on them.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|The DVD was defective about 5 mins into the move.  It was, from that point, totally unwatchable.  Borrowed another from a neighbor to be able to finish watching it.  Although annoying, AMAZON made good and shipped me a new one right away.
B00280NYQW|5.0|This is one of the best thrash metal recordings I have ever heard.  I was completely unprepared for the aural assault Artillery rolled me with.  My intro to this band was their album \\"By Inheritance\\", an 80's thrash chestnut in its time.  I still enjoy it, but it's obviously a bit dated.  Their new release, \\"When Death Comes\\", is a geometric improvement over any of their previous recordings.  A new singer (vastly better than the original), along with great production, virtuoso approaching musicianship, and downright pounding riffs, verses, and melodic bridges would make Dave Mustaine proud.  Most 40-something musicians from the 80s have long since lost the edge that made them the powerhouses they used to be.  Many plod along trying to cash in on the current trends and fail abysmally. (Are you listening Soldouttica?)  Not Artillery!  This cadre of middle aged metal-heads came back and completely schooled the genre.  I'm still in shock by how good this record is.    Artillery.......well done guys!!!

0374531269|5.0|A wonderful book in all the ways one would imagine.  What one has to keep in mind is that he is not a professional writer or memoirist, so there are many questions left unanswered and many painful memories left unexplored (his actual years as a full-fledged soldier are fast forwarded through and rarely referred back to in any detail).  This speaks volumes to the overwhelming nature of the experience.  Most of the book is spent describing his life beforehand, how he ended up a soldier, and then how he was recovered.  Also missing are details of how he came to be the object of UN attention.  Again, I don't necessarily think he knows.  But if you're looking for a book that explains the full, actual experiences of a boy soldier, his deepest feelings and fears, and a step by step description of how he was brought out, you'll be slightly disappointed.  If what you want is to listen to another's experience, respect what he is and is not comfortable talking about, and seek to understand by inference rather than explanation how his world works, this will be a wonderfully fulfilling book.  I must admit that I would welcome a followup book where he can perhaps look back with a little more distance and less pain, and discuss some things in the context of the history of his country and the culture of his people, things that as an American I did not understand as well as I would have wished.  But I certainly do not fault him or this book for what is not there.  Silence and omission are a language unto themselves.
0385504225|1.0|I've read all Brown's novels, and this one was a real disappointment.  Each of the three major twists are anemic, the science is bastardized, and the ending is so anti-climactic, I thought maybe all of the pages hadn't downloaded to my Kindle reader.    Finally, the prose and styling are so automated that I'm not sure Brown was present for a lot of it.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|This movie is amazing! Before I saw it I wasn't really sure what to expect. It has a great story that's filled with lots of action. I wound up seeing it 3 times in theatres which is VERY rare for me to see a movie more than once. I highly recommend \\"Fast & Furious.\\" I even think it's better than the first 3 movies.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Agents in a secret society of assassins are being systematically dispatched. They require someone of greater talent to squelch the culprit before they are all dispatched.  Their potential recruit is Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy). The head of the society Sloan (Morgan Freeman) sends Fox (Angelina Jolie), appropriately named, as the recruiter and trainer of the newly selected assassin. She has her work cut out for her. Will Wesley ever shape up? And is there more to his missions and what they told him?<br /><br />This film has lots of action which requires you to suspend the laws of physics. We also have Angela who does not distract from her character. And who can dispute that Morgan Freeman is not one of the best good guy/ bad guys?<br /><br />I do not like to have the media get in the way of reviews however I have only seen this on Blu-Ray and cannot compare it to other media.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Enthusiasts and first-time listeners of established British progressive rock group Porcupine Tree have much to digest in the \\"The Incident\\", the band's seventeenth, full-length studio album to date. The title track is a 55 minute, musical odyssey that synthesizes elements and motifs from previous releases to form an entirely new concept album. The lyrical content is highly autobiographical and is derived from experiences in the life of songwriter Steven Wilson that comment upon the nature of personalized events that appear distanced and insignificant to others, particularly the media.    \\"The Incident\\" represents the best of what has made Porcupine Tree so successful in underground music circles: an insistent drive for creating uncompromising new material that is expressed holistically through the \\"album\\" concept. Although Wilson shares responsibility for this vision, \\"The Incident\\" is much more than the latest in a line of prolific compositions from the songwriter. Listeners who are quick to extol this album simply on account of its association with Wilson should listen very carefully to the material before passing judgment.     The average listener, as many have pointed out, will appreciate the nuances of \\"The Incident\\" only through repeated, uninterrupted playing time. Those familiar with the Porcupine Tree back-catalog, such as Sky Moves Sideways or Lightbulb Sun  , will have the advantage of contextual history for understanding the stylistic components of the music. The contemporary edge of Blackest Eyes, industrial qualities of The Creator has a Mastertape, atmospherics of Rainy Taxi, and vocal  harmonization of Anesthetize are all combined into a swirling, near-seamless track.    Beyond the obvious experimental length and form of the composition, Wilson incorporates melodic song and vocal styles that seem more directly influenced from his work with Blackfield (Great Expectations, Drawing the Line) than necessarily from previous Porcupine Tree releases. Renewed attention to use of the acoustic guitar (Time Flies) is certainly common to both. These qualities crudely orient the record toward the feel of Spock's Beards' \\"Snow\\" in structure and melodic shape, although the psychadelic textures, melancholic lyrics, and other various elements are unquestionably Porcupine Tree.    From a compositional and technical perspective, \\"The Incident\\" is a tightly mixed work that transitions well between tracks and provides a dynamic listening experience. The shorter tracks are not 'under-developed' connecting fragments; they are complete, albeit short ideas that serve their own purposes. Tracks 1-8 contain somewhat more \\"contemporary\\" or \\"accessible\\" sounding material than the remainder of the album, and the much-heralded \\"Time Flies\\" is every bit as fulfilling as other reviewers have indicated, although Wilson's solo guitar work in the instrumental break is somewhat of a letdown. Gavin Harrison, as always, provides the cleanest and most technically impressive performance.    \\"The Incident\\" has its share of less impressive qualities, but these by and large do not detract from the overall experience. The guitar work seems pedantic and uninspiring at times, as does the introduction, \\"Occam's Razor\\". The mindless thrashing on \\"Drawing the Line\\" and \\"Time Flies\\" is certainly a bit tedious, and the spooky industrial qualities of \\"The Incident\\" (the song) may not appeal to some listeners. Previous Porcupine Tree material suggests that several of these elements could have been executed better.        The second disc features four compositions that compose an EP similar to that of Nil Recurring from the \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" sessions. \\"Bonnie the Cat\\" and \\"Remember Me Lover\\" are perhaps the most innovative of the group, although \\"Flicker\\" delivers that infectious Porcupine Tree psychadelic ambiance that fans have come to appreciate.     There is little merit to evaluating \\"The Incident\\" or any of its individual tracks   as better or worse inrelation to the bands' previous material. It is an exceptional \\"album\\" in the true sense of the word, and therefore rates highly among Porcupine Tree's similarly great productions. Those who have never been impressed with Wilson's guitar work or who lament the the intrusion of melodic \\"Blackfield\\" elements into the writing will of course find more to complain about.  The rest of us, however, will have much to talk about and look forward to.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|Indie, pop, dance, electronic, psychedelic ... all are good adjectives to describe MGMT's Oracular Spectacular.  Poetic and strange lyrics accompany great beats and strong synth sounds to make a truly unique album.  Some songs are nostalgic sounding, like they miss a past or innocence, while many others evoke a hedonistic style (of music and life).  These guys are definitely doing something new here, but they are obviously heavily influenced by the past.  I thought the sound quality of the actual cd was great.  Packaging was lame: I already ripped the cardboard case (I have seen thicker greeting cards), and there are some slight scratches from sliding the cd out.<br /><br />A great album for someone looking for something different: savage and artistic, without being clich&eacute;.  This is something far more uptempo, nothing dark or depressing.  Oracular Spectacular is an album that may not please everyone, but is still worth a listen.  My personal favorites are 1-time to pretend (the beginning is reminiscent of Bela Lugosi's dead by Bauhaus, 4-electric feel (my favorite-some have described is as psychedelic disco, but I am not so sure about the \\"disco,\\" I just have to move when I hear it), 5-kids (just a fun song, although the video is awful to watch--I do not like to watch kids being terrorized for no reason!), 6-4th dimensional transition (very classic rock influenced with a great drum, and 9-handshake (it has a rocking ending).  8-Of Moons, Birds & Monsters is a very pop song that has all the earmarks of being a 60s hit; something the Turtles or the Zombies would do.<br /><br />And just so you have a reference for my taste in music: I love Interpol: [[ASIN:B00006BTCA Turn on the Bright Lights]], [[ASIN:B000A78Z78 Antics: The Special Edition]], and [[ASIN:B000PY32CO Our Love to Admire]].  And the strange sounds of this album sounded like what Daniel Johnston could have been, here's a sampling of his music [[ASIN:B000F1IPJ2 Welcome to My World]].<br /><br />All in all, a great musical experience: highly recommend.ience: highly recommend.
1587990717|4.0|Found the book strangely absorbing and innovative. Myself, I have very little knowledge of things mathematical or statistical, but a rather strong interest in them. Nassim Taleb delivers a spirited defence of skepticism, which I always like. His examples from the world of financial trading (and gaming) are entertaining and probably(!) illustrative, as are his anectodes from other fields of life and his obviously very extensive reading.  I should have liked to read a non-polemical discussion of his thesis. But it would have to be written in the same and wonderfully popular and humorous vein that runs thru this fine book.

B001MW0J2Y|2.0|Really, I did.  I read lots of reviews of Frusciante's other albums; I heard (I think) that he plays a lot with The Mars Volta, one of my favorites.  I assumed that when he sloughed off the Chili Peppers, Frusciante would go wild.  Um...no.  This sounded like re-warmed Chili Peppers music to me--and they lost me about 3 albums ago.  I was not excited; not entranced; not even interested.    Total bummer.
B00001MXXH|5.0|I have the 1999 DVD with John Hughes' commentary. (Believe it or not, that's the only extra on the disc!)<br /><br />BEWARE: the more recent \\"Bueller...Bueller...Edition\\" (released in 2006) is missing the commentary. Clearly half a dozen years doesn't automatically make a better DVD, even if it does make more money for the studio! I would much rather have the director's insight than a few more outtakes.<br /><br />Hughes reportedly shot tons of film so there must be even more out there. With his passing last year, who knows where the film is or who has the rights.<br /><br />P.S. Am I the only one who hated Mia Sara in this? The chemistry between Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck is much more captivating.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|The people who seem to like this movie seem to fall into one (or more) of three classes:  Tim Burton fans, Johnny Depp fans, and literary purists.  I enjoy some of Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's films, but cannot say that I'm a fan because I will not see a movie just because Burton, Depp, or both are associated with it.  I also do not believe that a movie must adhere to the original story to be brilliant.  Many memorable and truly enjoyable movies - Disney's \\"Mary Poppins\\", \\"Peter Pan\\", and \\"The Little Mermaid\\", Fleming's \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", and Chuck Jones' \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" - are not absolutely true to but simply extremely entertaining treatments based on the original stories.  \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" deviated in specific details from Roald Dahl's book, but the essential elements and plot of the screenplay (written by Roald Dahl) of Charlie's visit to the factory were absolutely true to the book.  If anything, Charlie passing the ultimate test by returning the Everlasting Gobstopper to Wonka, rather than seeking revenge by trying to sell it to \\"Slugsworth\\", was far more satisfying than the book's version, in which he gets the factory simply by being the last child left.    That being said, there were three specific items that ruined this version of the movie for me.  The first was Depp's portrayal of Wonka.  The character in the book is an eccentric but far from the psychologically damaged character that Depp decided to portray.  The second was the backplot that tried to psychoanalyze and explain Wonka's character (the same mistake Ron Howard made in \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\").  Wonka was meant to be an enigma and should always remain so, much in the same way that \\"no one quite knows the reason\\" why the Grinch hated Christmas.  The third was the dismal and forgettable songs in the remake that added nothing to the movies, especially with a single character portraying all the Oompa Loompas.  Granted the first movie was a musicaland the remake a movie with songs, but if a movie contains songs they should be worth remembering (which is probably why Newley and Bricusse rewrote the Oompa-Loompa songs for the first movie).
031606792X|3.0|Im still reading it actually. This book is basically what the last 3 have built up to. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but honestly, after I got about half way through the book, I lost interest. The twilight series I totally love- don't get me wrong. I just think, personally, the author should have made it shorter and got the point, then letting it drag out. Im looking forward to finishing it, so I can atleast say I finished the series, so I need to bite the bullet and do so.
B001453LX8|5.0|As with most established things, people get accustomed. But it's the evolution and change over time that makes good performers great...or not depending on a factors. In this case of New Amerykah, it's evolution and change for the better. From the intro that does a good job of painting a hilarious if a disturbingly true picture of America to the anthem of The Healer or the catchy Cell or the direct reflection of the times in That Hump, New Amerykah is a deep collection. Like earlier EBadu releases there's a good mix of jazz, funk and even some old school 70's music that would fit well in a Shaft film. The CD overall is different in that the first listen can catch you off guard but take the time to listen to what's presented with an open mind and there's a wealth of talent presented in New Amerykah.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I appreciate what muse has done with this album.  Some nice original tunes and performances of them.  However, most are in the same key and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHY DID THEY USE SYNTHESIZED STRINGS IN EXOGENESIS!    Using sampled strings sounds like crap, has no feeling, deprives musicians of jobs, and is all together a lose-lose situation for all parties.    Other than that, i would recommend this album.
159102594X|1.0|I bought this book from the Science Fiction Book Club and returned it without finishing the book. The swearing was excessive and offensive, and I found the writing to be very crude. So, not only did the book not have any fluidity in writing, but I found myself annoyed with what I was reading. Usually the SFBC gives a warning about excessive swearing, but they must have discontinued that practice, since there was no warning. So, I hope this will help other readers to be aware of the language in this book before purchasing.

Can't say \\"Day and Nite\\" or \\"Make Her Say\\" showed me anything about Cudi that make me think he would drop a solid album, but the \\"concept\\" idea and his dedication made me take a chance.<br /><br />Your liking of this album will be largely dependent on how you enjoy the diversity and experimentation Cudi partakes.  This is not a rap record - point blank.  Cudi raps on some tracks, but musicially this is a very diverse genre-blending affair.  We have some rock roots, house, dub, techno, electronic roots, etc.  The music is dope throughout, but Cudi's singing and slow talking are what really make or break the CD.<br /><br />If you can vibe with his so-so voice (singing wise) and enjoy the reflective spoken word then this will be a record you greatly appreciate.  If you want more of a standard rap record, this CD will likely leave you scratching your head.<br /><br />I like Cudi though and this CD left me pleasantly surprised.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I adore this group.  I saw them on Letterman also and was smitten.  I love the variety of sounds and the fact that they are not just another grungy bunch screaming into the mic.  I have been playing the album since I received it and everytime I hear something else which is new.  The lyrics make sense and there is a banjo in there somewhere too which always gets my attention.  Buy the album and support the group.  Give it as a gift.   It is like a banquet of sound.
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. The entire album is hot! There was no one weak song at all and the fact that the entire album is remastered made it even better!! Classic B.I.G!!!! A must have for all!!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|As the daughter of a Scotish Rite 33rd degree Mason; an Eastern Star mother; and a member of The Rainbow for Girls and a one tijme Star member,  I am tired of the mysteriou, plotting Masons.  The Masons are nothing more or less then a group of usually prominent non-Catholic men who practice civic philanthropy; enjoy fraternal companionship while indulging in archane rituals which would be grounds for commitment if practiced openly.  About the only conspiratorial thing they do is attempt to support fellow Masons in their real lives.  Please find another group upon which to build your conspiracies.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Don't you hate it when you hear a great song on the radio or at a club so you take a gamble and buy the CD? That is what happened with me purchasing this one. The title track is very good and sure to put you in a good mood, with its classic pop sound. However, like many pop artists its one of only a few good songs on the CD. It is as though the producer decided to focus on one or two songs and the rest are just fillers. Besides the title track and a handful of others Gwen sounds like she is in 7th grade trying to cross the lines of trying to be cool and be a cheerleader. The music is stiff (for lack of better words) for the most part, and the yodel she incorporates is very irritating. However, if you like high school cheerleading and want to put it to music you may like it.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This is why I love Muse.  Each song is so vividly different, as if it belongs to a different album.  But all of them are uniquely distinct to Muse.  That's what makes these guys so talented. While some songs left more of an impression than others, the album as a whole is rock solid.
B0000B1OGD|5.0|this movie classic is one not to miss. the effects at that time was fantastic.
B001684L0A|4.0|Much like Band of Brothers before it, I love this HBO mini series.  Good acting, camera work and story telling in general.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|And what is the hell wrong become with superheroes?! They do not play positive roles. What is that kind of superhero who killed his pregnant girlfriend in cold blood and raped another one. What kind is superheros who does not care about mankind. One wants to kill everyone on this planet and another one does not care. And this [...] idea of blue naked rolled up eyes dude does not fit for superman character at all! This blue butt naked dude did nothing good as superhero through whole movie. Thanks God Keanu Reeves denied this \\"super blue watch me naked\\" dude role. Movie is \\"R\\" rated. Do not let youth watch it. Strong violence and sex scenes especially this blue dude who is naked all the time and I kind of tired of this irrelevance to superhero idea. Movie is slow. A lot of talk then butchering some one and again in the same meaner. Graphic good though. Ideas jumps from scene to scene hardly taking the main course. Well I said it all. You think if you want to spend money on this kind of absurd film.
0061766089|3.0|First, I'd never even heard of Design Thinking, so this was definitely a good initial introduction. The contents section, rewritten as a mind map, gives the reader an immediate sense of what to expect in the rest of the book (though ironically I think the table of contents is easier to use, which to some extent disproves the whole idea). Stylistically, there are some really good chapters that are a joy to read, and others seem really dry and lacking in information or direction. The promotion of the author's company IDEO starts to get a little grating as well, though with my non-cynical hat on, I can see why he draws on their case studies to illuminate the subject.<br /><br />I like the ideas and there are some core beliefs that I absolutely agree with, in terms of using inter-disciplinary approaches to solve problems. I would have liked to see more practical information in how the average person or company can adopt the approach, since the book really appears to contend that 'Design Thinking' is some sort of innate talent rather than a skill that can be learned. And that's a shame since if you're looking for practical information on how to embrace design thinking, it's definitely a little thin here. Overall, quite an enjoyable read, and a good introduction if you're new to the subject (like me).
B001FB4VZS|3.0|Smallville season 8 wasn't bad, but as you watch it you sometimes feel that the writers are trying to delay the inevitable, the creation of Superman.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is a thoroughly inspiring use of music to create connections among people.  The music itself is beautiful; the images on the DVD are very moving.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|After watching the Oprah interview, and having loved Whitney years ago, I really wanted to like this album.  But, I'm afraid it just isn't there.  Even not comparing it to her old stuff, I was put off by the over orchestration, the overly backed up vocals, so much so that you can hardly distinguish Whitney's voice from the rest, and the monotonous, same sound of all the tracks.  There was no take-away, signature song to rave about.  I admire the introspection and telling of the tale, but I can only hope that with proper care, her voice will at least become a soloist voice again.  But not here...
B001AQTWF2|3.0|It is hard to believe that I, along with everyone else, waited years for this album to come out. It's not a horrible album but it's not really all that good either.  Her voice is...different.  Her years of abuse to her throat and her lungs is extremely noticeable - the golden voice is gone.  What once sounded like a bird now sounds like one that smoked for years - gravelly and too deep with no range really to speak of.<br /><br />If you were expecting the Whitney of old then sorry, you won't find something even remotely close in this album.  Better to buy one of her old albums and reminisce...
4789009637|4.0|It was pretty fast delivery and in good condition, but there were a few nicks and dings on it, but nothing too big.
0307588335|5.0|I have read all of the major titles in this category (When Genius Failed, Liars Poker, Barbarians at the Gate etc).  This book gave me a feel and sense of the trading floor I have never found in another book. Larry's account of his path to Wall Street rung true in so many ways for those of us in Finance who didnt have an Ivy League education but dreamed of being part of it.  His book is great for those new to Finance and those of us who have worked in it for years.  It is the only account of the credit crunch that actually makes any sense and which addresses the serious flaws of judgement and logic that lead us to the brink of systemic collapse.  If you read one non-fiction book this year, let it be Larry's brave and thrilling account of what happens when the lunatics run the asylum.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|While all of this discussion about mono vs. stereo, are the remasters all that, and on and on, is amusing. I would like to share this reality check. A couple of hours ago, I came across a slide show of pictures of the video music awards on Sunday night. Most seemed focussed on Kanye West and some rude antics towards Taylor Swift. For some reason Swift was receiving an award (unless it was for most vapid vocalist, I do not understand why), West was upset Beyonce didn't win the award. Frankly I could not be less impressed by any of these talentless hacks. None of whom even play an instrument. Beyonce in particular, seems to be famous for being able to pack a big behind, into a tiny dress, while somehow claiming to be a \\"good girl\\". In fact, of all of the people who appeared in the slides of this award show, only two actually did play any instrument. Alicia Keys (not a big fan, but at least she has talent) and some guitar player guy from Green Day (they have their moments).    J Lo , Eminem, Pink, Diddy the iddyot, Kanye, GrandMadonna and some horrible creature calling itself Lady Gaga (makes you long for Wendy O Williams).... these are the names and faces of the Biz today.    THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE. HOW LUCKY WERE WE TO BE AROUND WHEN THE FAB FOUR WERE PRODUCING MUSIC THAT TODAYS KIDS CANNOT EVEN DREAM OF GETTING, FROM THE LIKES OF THOSE NAMED ABOVE. MY GOD IT BOGGLES THE MIND. MONO, STEREO, HELL HOLD MY HEAD UNDER WATER AND PLAY THE FIRST CD ISSUES THROUGH A BLOWN SPEAKER...IT IS STILL so many worlds away from what is passed off as music now. Stereo, mono, take your pick, listen enjoy and rejoice in the fact that they existed at all and were preserved in these recordings. While your at it, pick up some Les Paul recordings. After all the late Mr. Paul, literally made it possible for all of those tracks to be ping-ponged around, on those multitrack machines. He did invent them after all. Heck the stuff with Mary Ford is probably even in glorious mono.
1400049628|2.0|4.5 stars from 422 reviews? How did that happen? This book was amazingly boring. You can only  repeat the same ideas over and over to add pages to your book. But the main problem was, some of the \\"rules\\" contradict each other. In the early chapters, Brooks advises that in order to better survive a Zombie attack, head to urban areas. High rise and apartment buildings are much more defensible than a suburban home. He also states that tenements in urban areas are much more secure than those in the suburbs because of pre-zombie crime rates. This is all true. But in later chapters, he says to AVOID urban areas. \\"Where the living are, the undead will be.\\" He also says that the chaos leading to a level 2 or 3 zombie attack will cause many deaths from human interaction alone. Ummm...ok? And then later on, he states the best place is to just stay in your home. Huh? This is just one example. But then again, you'd already be dead if you follow this guide when the undead rise. I could've written a better guide and saved you some money:  #1 Head to a gun store  #2 Head to [...]  #3 Barricade, Survive.  #4 You save $10.04
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Quick delivery and in excellent condition.  This remake of the classic is wonderful.  My 7 year old daughter would watch it all day if I would let her.
1584282584|5.0|Neil Van Niekerk's ON-CAMERA FLASH TECHNIQUES FOR DIGITAL WEDDING AND PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY tells how to create refined wedding photos using on-camera flash rather than waiting for perfect light or using other devices. From choosing equipment and understanding flash exposures to using high-speed flash sync and duplicating the effects of available light, this is a winner for any aspiring wedding photographer.
0439023491|5.0|I received this as an advanced reader copy, so I was able to read it over the summer and part of me wishes I hadn't because now I have to wait even longer for the third book to come out to find the outcome of Katniss and Peta. Very much anticipating the last book!
0385504225|2.0|The pages turned quickly, but this was in part because I found myself skimming the vast sections of religious philosophy, psuedo scientific mumbo-jumbo and pedantic exposition, all of which seemed to go on endlessly.<br /><br />The book builds and builds until the shockings truths are finally revealed.  Without disclosing any details, one of these shockers had been painfully obvious for some time and I was impatient for Brown to just get it over with.  When the other shocker was revealed, my reaction was \\"so what\\".<br /><br />I enjoyed the cliff-hanger chapter endings in Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, but they quickly became annoying in \\"The Lost Symbol\\".  Worse, much of the book felt like padding.  The last 50 or so pages was like an infomercial -- the story is over, but wait, there's more!  I kept hoping the book would have an interesting conclusion, but it ended with a wimper, not a bang.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD filmed impeccably by the BBC as only they can do the classics.  Wonderful cast, superb acting and beautiful costumes.  I am running out of superlatives which is a shame because I cannot praise this production enough.  I did have a problem though,  I have my own copy of this film and decided that my daughter would really enjoy it so bought it for her birthday.  Unfortunately, Amazon, in their wisdom,  decided that my son may like it too and so sent one to him as well, at my cost and not on my instruction.  No problem I thought I will just email and tell them of their error.  HOURS LATER I REALISED THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT CONTACT AMAZON.  My son no longer lives at the address they used so God knows who has the video I paid for.  It makes me feel very nervous about using Amazon again.  I HOPE YOU SEE THIS, STAFF AT AMAZON AND GET IN TOUCH.  THANKYOU
0385504225|4.0|As a fan of the Da Vinci Code - I was eagerly anticipating Dan Brown's newest novel.  I admit, the opening sequences were great, and since I live in Washington DC I have been to all of the places Brown describes in the book.  I admit I discovered new facts about he city that I have lived near for over 20 years and it intrigued me to actually google and confirm several of the facts related in the book.  The story was definately a page turner until the final scenes -POSSIBLE SPOILER!- the ending was a bit long after we solved the mystery of the pyramid.  I know the religous angle was important but seemed a to drag a bit talking about how we are made in god's image - the divinity - etc.
1934180890|5.0|In the seven kingdom medieval fantasy world of Katsa and Prince Po a 'grace' is an inborn gift. Katsa's 'grace' is to be a preternaturally gifted fighter. Prince Po's 'grace' is a form of telepathy. And there are other 'graces' in the world -- some of which enable their possessors to commit horrific atrocities. That is the setting for Kristin Cashore's brilliantly imaginative action/adventure fantasy story that is so perfectly presented in a true 'theatre of the mind' full cast theatrical performance that includes strategically employed music. Of special note is the use of age-appropriate casting among the voice actors. A truly riveting fantasy adventure, filled with plot twists, populated by memorable characters, and flawless production values, \\"Graceling\\" will appeal to listeners from 12 to 82 and is an especially recommended addition to personal, school, and community library audio book collections.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I consider Muse to be a band that never fails to disappoint. The band stands out amongst most main-stream bands nowadays, with their artistic style and unique sound. Their new album definitely features what one should expect from a Muse album, something out of the ordinary.    Their new album, The Resistance, stands out from all of their previous works. The new batch of songs on their album has a more \\"electronic\\" sound to it, while at some points it strays to an almost \\"punk-ish\\" style, to the very end of the album, which is basically a \\"Muse symphony\\".    Although I'm a very big Muse fan, I was sort of let down by this album, especially after reading reviews before listening. The songs don't seem very \\"fresh\\" and there aren't any that really stand out or could be considered one of Muse's classics. Sure some songs are pretty good (Resistance and United States of Eurasia), and the symphony really was an impressive surprise, but something about the album just falls short for me. I would recommend this album for Muse enthusiasts or people looking for a new \\"space-rock\\"/orchestra experience. But as for new fans for Muse, I would rather recommend listening to Absolution or Black Holes and Revelations (which is by far their best CD). As for this...unfortunately, it is Muse's most disappointing album.    Score: B
0385504225|4.0|Pros  Just like any other Dan brown book  1. twists, turns  2. Maths, Science  3. Secret Societies, though I think why is it called secret when everybody knows everything about it.  4. Message within the book which is somewhat beyond its time.   5. I particularly liked the choice of name for the characters, well thought.    Cons   1. Mr Brown you could have at least come up with a new shape for the plot, though this one isnt bad but knowing the shape already makes it less exciting specially after 4 books.  2. Sometimes it tries to give too much knowledge, that part was much more justified in DVC, with LS it seems more pushing down the throat.  3. At times the books seems to be flattering the church and the masons.  4. The end, I expected it to be dull just like any other DB book, but this was seriously disappointing. Maybe it is Mr. Brown's signature or something which he does not want to change.     Judgement   Mr. Brown needs to come up with a new formula if he wants to keep making the millions he does now.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Not the old one...but a new one..who knows how to sing with a NEW/Different instrument as good as ever.  IF u r expecting the old one, you won't like  be open minded
B001SAHOBO|5.0|This movie was simply excellent. I have been a kung fu fan for almost 30 years and this movie ranks among the top of this genre. Buy with confidence...
B002AT4K9Q|4.0|amazing movie with cool stunts and attractive leading men, a pretty good plot line..i just wish there werent so many scantily clad women and sexual scenes.
0811806405|5.0|I've only read about three chapters into this book. So far the information has been very detailed, clear, and focused. Diagrams have been very helpful. The book teaches luthiers in the making how to build a steel string or classical acoustic guitar. Most of the concepts apply to both, but they go over any special instructions for either guitar as the reader goes through the general steps.<br /><br />I'll continue reading it once I can purchase all the necessary tools. Just based on what I've read up to this point I think the book deserves 5 stars and I suggest this to anyone looking to learn how to build an acoustic guitar.
B001993Y2C|2.0|Let me just say that I did not purchase the blu ray set myself, rather it was purchased as a gift for me (which I couldnt argue with). If  you're thinking of buying this one on your own then think again...    The series is fantastic, as anyone will tell you. However the blu ray edition is absolutely horrid. As most of the other reviewers have already noted the packaging is possibly the worst I have ever seen for any product I have ever encountered (especially disc based media).     As far as the blu rays themselves are concerned, the High def is really not that impressive. The series was shot in high def but was intentionally made fuzzy and even blurry to achieve the look the producers wanted. The high definition transfer retains the original look and it literally doesnt add anything to view it in HD, and even may be a detriment.     All in all save your money and buy the complete series on dvd, in the individual season box sets!!!!
0385504225|2.0|Ah, autumn, a time of mellow fruitfulness and MASS IDIOCY! No, its okay, I don't mean to be bitter. Not now. Not yet. I'll save that for two years from now, when the 2,493rd person asks me if I've read it.     I will say, as a librarian, that I enjoyed the chase scene using the conveyor belts at the LOC: we have those at my library, and I can't wait to try that.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. Megadeth the \\"trash metal\\" band is back and better then ever. One of their best albums yet. \\"This Day We Fight\\" is my favorite track.
B001AQT11M|4.0|I am looking forward to the 2009 dvd edition because I have seen countless times my vhs masterpiece copy which still plays like a dream. True, I have quite a few dvd sets, but I am a diehard vhs fan with many still in current library and thanks to JVC for great dual systems to play alternate formats on one unit.<br />What I like about the discs are the compactability for on the go units such as laptop video units which I also have two of, and play very well, both Sylvannia & Go Video, so the convenience of watching my favorite movies or tv shows on discs is great. I also like the internet movies, but the discs I can view anytime and anywhere, and being my laptop videos are also battary operated is an added plus.<br />The features to these disc sets are also great, although I do find I dont have much time to look at everything, but I get them just in case the day comes I need extras to watch instead of the same film fare.<br />The recent Pinocchio platinum release just goes to show Disney movies just seem to get better with the revolution of video formats because the studios do extra enhancements to the film footage which make the color and sound vibrant with clarity.<br />The only complaint I have ever had with vhs format was the lack of freedom to skip randomly, and the need to \\"rewind\\" after each viewing whether the film has been entirely viewed or not.<br />So I look forward to another disney classic in my firm grasp such as this Snow White feature. It was a techno animated pioneer of its day when it introduced the first long length cartoon film which recieved many awards from the Academy. The animation still looks splendid with the effect of water color in landscapes. The songs are historical with Hi-Ho, and I cant count how many references Ive seen from many other non disney movies in regard to Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs lingo.<br />The intro scene of the queen consulting her magic mirror is the staple to disney villains. Snow White's eerie tree sequence as she escapes from henchman is still compelling and transfers well to the honored ride in Disneyland itself.<br />There are many historical facts to the making of Snow White as the frame by frame coloring of Snow White's rosey cheeks which was painstakingly done by disney artists. It's also a hoot to watch the live footage of men dressed as dwarfs which helped animators with the dance sequence. The queen transformation to the evil witch hag is one of the best fright night bits in movie history as her witch makes the biggest impression alongside the Wicked Witch of the Witch in Wizard Of Oz.<br />The final scenes of the dwarfs dealing with the poisoning of their princess is very well done and incredibly animated with reverence.<br />Snow White's prince, however, makes a very slight appearance throughout the movie and barely becomes much of a standout character because he is not given much to do other than become the apple of Snow White's eye (couldn't resist).<br />Needless to say, the seven dwarfs are the real stars because they are personality plus, and the cute animals all around are the charming backdrop to the whole feature.henchman is still compelling and transfers well to the honored ride in Disneyland itself.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|One of the best shows on TV since Sopranos....Season 2 has been just as good or better than season 1 so far.
B00197POXG|5.0|This set has been one of the best buys I've made in a long time.  There has been nothing good to watch on TV.  Everything is negative, stressful, or not appropriate for family viewing.  This is a great show that teaches life lessons and is entertaining.  Jane Seymour is wonderful (as well as the supporting cast).  You won't regret buying it!
0312360266|5.0|I am not a Young Adult, by any means.  However, I love this series.  I am on the 5th one, Hunted, now and am all ready dreading the down time I am going to have until Tempted comes out. I highly recommend these books, great reads for sure !!!!!
B001NFTZPM|4.0|we all wear masks for one reason or another. this cool disc-mask thing is nice. i thought it would ruin the discs......since many of these type of designs usually do.....but it doesn't. and if you want the movie on your ipod.....it has a disc for that too.<br />the movie was a little long for my taste......it could've gone a bit faster near the end. but...overall......an amazing last-full performance by heath ledger. may he rest in peace. and a different side to christian bale his other movies have yet to produce.

1603580557|5.0|Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows is the perfect primer for people who want to learn more about system thinking.  The book is clear, provides multiple examples and clear diagrams/illustrations to help people understand what systems are, how they work, and how you can use systems thinking to understand and manage complexity.<br /><br />I have read other systems thinking books by people like Peter Checkland and they are good but this book is better to introduce people to the principles of systems thinking.  The book does more than just discuss systems but also systems traps and how to intervene to change systems.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to people who want to understand systems thinking, documentation and management.  If you are someone who knows system thinking and want to teach others, then start with this book.

0439023491|5.0|With the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy, Collins has totally defied the unfortunate truth that a sequel rarely lives up to the promise of the first book. Not only does this one not disappoint, it's a truly good book. No \\"middle book syndrome\\" here! Once again, Collins has turned in a page-turner of a story, that, while it revisits some of the themes from The Hunger Games, is also fresh and new.<br /><br />What happened after the dramatic finale of Katniss's Hunger Games? Collins relates the effects of Katniss's actions in her personal world, throughout the 12 Districts, and even in the Capitol. In doing so, Collins has given fuller flesh to the world her characters inhabit. In Catching Fire, she not only ratchets up the tension, but sets the stage for a thoughtful, insightful, and exciting final book in the trilogy. If expectations were high for the second book, they're that much higher for the third.
0440241030|4.0|When I ran out of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee stories, a helpful person suggested I try Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" series.    I've read about 8 of them, and this one has been my favorite yet.     Lee Child is no John MacDonald, but he can compose a gripping story. \\"The Hard Way\\" has a great villain, plausible premise, engaging characters and good pacing. If you enjoyed \\"Trip Wire\\" or \\"Persuader\\", I think this one is even better.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was fortunate enough to be one of the first few to check this out from the local library the morning it was released.  I finished it this morning, and have to say it was not as good as Brown's previous two Langdon novels.  Entertaining--usually, educational in terms of D.C. landmarks--certainly, but less satisfying than I had anticipated.  Other reviewers have outlined enough of the storyline--I was bored and fidgety during the last few chapters, largely because I have no patience for authors who impose a lecture on spiritual philosophy as an ending in what is supposed to be a work of fiction.  If I wanted that sort of thing I would read nonfiction books that are written as such.

159448385X|4.0|Vivid and often heartbreaking. Hosseini is great story teller who transports you to a different place with amazing realism. Having not heard comment to the contrary, I trust the depiction is honest and fair. He will never be elected to the Kabul Chamber of Commerce. It raised my awareness of the trials faced by Afghan women. Hopefully Afghan men, who've not done so, will join the 21st century and do credit to their gender by treating their wives and sisters as God's children instead of property.

B00284BMBM|5.0|I am not one of the people who knew Chris Daughtry from American Idol, so when my friend introduced me to his music from his first CD I was clueless to who he was. But I fell in love with his voice. I loved his first album so much that I couldn't wait for the second one. I tried not to get my expectations up for it to much though, so often new artists come out with fantastic 1st albums and bomb on their second.     But Daughtry did not let down their fans. Their 2nd album is just as awesome as their first. The only thing I would've liked even more was if they rocked out more instead of having so many slow songs. But the ballads are good, so I can't really complain about them either. His voice is just so wonderful that I could listen to him sing anything.     If you're a Daughtry fan, I'm guessing you have already bought this CD... If not, then RUN, don't walk, and buy it. If you like rock or adult alternative music, you will also enjoy this CD.
0385504225|2.0|(Not really any spoilers in this review, but it may be considered spoilerish by some)<br /><br />After reading `Da Vinci Code' & waiting years to get my hands on the next Robert Langdon book, I just can't help but feel incredibly under whelmed by this book. Dan Brown has had enough time to where this should have been a better book than what it turned out to be, but somehow this book ended up being just a big disappointment to me.<br /><br />The book follows up with Robert Langdon after his escapades in the previous book. (No, you don't learn anything about what happened to Sophie, although we do learn that Langdon has put out a book about the symbolism from his previous adventure.) Langdon has been invited to Washington D.C. to speak as a last minute guest of influential Peter Solomon. Once there, he gets embroiled in a mystery of very high stakes as he must discover secrets that masons have tried to keep hidden for hundreds of years- and try to keep them from a menacing threat who calls himself Mal'akh.<br /><br />Really & truthfully, there weren't as many surprises or big gasping revelations in the story. You can see many of the big \\"surprises\\" a mile away (I guessed Mal'akh's identity very early on in the novel) & the riddles just aren't as great as the ones in his previous two books. I can't quite place my finger on why the mysteries & riddles aren't as interesting as in the previous books by him- it's not like the mysteries of the masons don't intrigue me.<br /><br />As far as character development goes, I really didn't see a lot of it. We're given a bit of background on each character, but only one or two people are really fleshed out. One of the more promising characters (CIA operative Inoue Sato) has some of the worst character development in that it just isn't done. She throws her weight around but shows no real depth to her character, which is a big shame because it could have been far better executed. Other characters in the book appear & are mentioned a few times but serve as cannon fodder for the villain. There's also the female sidekick of Katherine Solomon (sister of Peter) whose main purpose is to serve as a sounding board for all of Langdon's theorizing & such. (Thankfully she's not a romantic interest- there's NO chemistry between these characters.)<br /><br />After the big showdown with the villain there's about 40 pages of Langdon & Katherine getting most of the mysteries revealed, which after a while got a little dull. I couldn't help but hear the \\"wrap it up\\" music from the Oscars playing in my head at one point- I just wanted Brown to get to the point & do a cleaner ending to the book.<br /><br />This isn't to say that I didn't get some enjoyment out of this book. It was good for whiling away a few hours, but as a much anticipated follow up it fell drastically short. (I wasn't even really expecting that much out of this book either...) I'm torn between giving this book three stars or giving it two stars- I've read far better from his contemporaries in the field (not to mention better from the author himself), but I'm going to have to face the truth- this book just wasn't that great. So yeah... 2.5 stars (but I'm giving it a 2).fodder for the villain.

B002C6K7N0|3.0|I've been a huge Megadeth fan since their inception and I love most of their albums but a few of the more recent ones haven't been that appealing to me. Endgame has some killer riffs, rhythms, and vocals. However, as with Abominations, the lyrics are uninspiring, often political in nature and even lame at times (ie. - When it's dog-eat-dog, you are what you eat...or...the roaches licked the cupboards clean of tv dinners & beer???). This is a shame because a) the music is kick ass, hardcore metal b) Mustaine has always written some great lyrics. They just seem forced, lack melody and not well thought out IMO.  Maybe lyrical content is not as important to others but for me it counts for a lot. Maybe it will grow on me with a few more listens but I say bring back the angry Dave! I guess it's hard to be angry when you are a wealthy rock star. The same fate has befallen Metallica but so much more so...Endgame, while flawed, is leaps and bounds better than the latest from Hetfield and the boyz.
1594488916|4.0|I don't normally read Non-Fiction books mostly because the writing style is so much different than a fiction book and is often times a slower read. This one was no different for me. With that said however I actually really liked this book even if It took me longer to get through.<br /><br />I found all the rare book information fascinating and I'm not sure I'll ever look at a book the same again. I also learned a lot of interesting stuff, stuff I would have never given a second thought too before reading this book.<br /><br />I found Gilkey to be an interesting sort of fellow, even though he is the thief in question. I, like Allison, found myself wondering what made him tick. What compelled him to perform all these acts of thievery just to obtain this book or that book. In the end I don't think I can really understand why he does what he does because I'm not him. Part of me feels sad for the obsession that must drive him to do these thing but at the same time I also hate him for his selfishness in thinking he deserves to have these books at whatever cost.<br /><br />In the end I think Allison did a wonderful job on this book. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love for books, it really was an informative read.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought one of these to use on our Baby Jogger City Mini double stroller instead of the expensive Baby Jogger accessory. It works great and is an excellent value for the price. I've had no problem with sippy cups, bottled water, paper cups from Starbucks, etc. It stays on when you fold up the stroller and the center pocket is great for keys, cell phone, a snack cup, or whatever small items you need to stash.  (Edited to add: On the double, it attaches to the center perpendicular bar and then either of the outsides of the stroller handle.)
0385341008|5.0|Like Dodie Smith's \\"I Capture the Castle,\\" this book makes me nostalgic for places I've never been and people I've never met. And I dare you to tell someone the title without cracking a smile!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|The movie arrived in a timely fashion but the DVD was a bit flawed (it \\"skipped\\" in the middle). The product was sold as \\"new\\" so I am not sure why it would have a problem.
B001RIY49C|4.0|Of course, it's made of plastic; did you think it was made of chrome steel? For eighty bucks which also includes multiple versions of the movie? This item sits on a shelf between between hand signed movie posters of the original TERMINATOR movie and T2 in my home theater, which is by the way a real home theater with a twelve foot screen and 7 channel surround. The kids get a big kick out of it. I only wish there could be a way of keeping the red (eyes) led's on all the time. I am exploring for ways of doing that without modifying it beyond it's original properties and destroying its collector value.  It serves its purpose and I would have given it five stars had there be a way to keep the eyes turned on all the time.
B000093BDX|5.0|I own the 12 inch albums from which this antholgy is compiled.  This release is by far the best, and most complete, collection of these seminal songs, which for all of us who first heard the songs on AM and FM, is so important to or \\"nostalgia buttons\\"........
0312360266|3.0|I recently picked up this book at walmart for $7.95.  It was sitting next to the Twilight Series (Which I have already read). I figured \\"hmm.. cheap buy I hope it's good if not oh well).  I started this book and finished within two days.  At first I wasn't sure I would get through it.  The first chapter of the book throws the reader off a little bit.  The main character Zoey seems much like other fictional characters I have read about.  She describes her life as boring and that she does not fit in, as well as having parents who do not understand her and an over-controlling stepfather who is a crazy faith driven person, more or less.  When she becomes marked (like Harry receiving his first owl), she all of a sudden becomes an incredibly important person, and also creates new friends quite quickly in her new school. (Which for some reason I keep thinking of Hogwarts the castle).  She also discovers that she as special powers that just come naturally to her.  As far as the \\"romantic\\" part of the book basically the most popular good looking guy is into her (Bella and Edward anyone?)    Anyway other than that stuff (which I found quite disappointing) The book was... OKAY.  It picked up towards the end and got quite interesting, which made me purchase the next book.    However there ARE a few things that I found unconvincing.  The cussing and reference to sexual tendencies that the high school aged children do is not convincing at all.  I KNOW that I have heard worse language and much MUCH more \\"sex stuff\\" involved in high school than this author is letting on.  It almost sounds like the author wrote it like that to convince parents to let their children read the book.    Altogether I give the book 2 out of 5.  Although the story line was so-so the characters in the book left it empty and undeveloped.    And does anyone else find it oddly annoying that Shaunee and Erin call themselves \\"Twin\\" - not even twins call themselves twin to each other.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Leave it to FX to bring another fabulous, kind of outrageous series to get hooked on. This is a fantastic show.
B000286S8S|4.0|My brother bought this collection yesterday, and since I already own 7 Van Halen albums and have heard most of the rest all the way through, I initially wasn't very excited. Last night I popped in Disc One to find myself immersed in the guitar virtuoso of Eddie Van Halen on the first track, Eruption, a solo I have heard a hundred times but can never get tired of. Next up, three new Sammy Hagar songs. I wasn't too keen on these being good, since I had already heard Up For Breakfast live, but they were decent for \\"Best Of\\" bonus tracks. It's About Time is my favorite of these, beginning with a mean, not entirely Van Halen heavy guitar riff which caught me off guard. This song is pure Van Hagar and became an instant favorite; wish I could say the same about the other two but they are only average and I was turned off by Up For Breakfast's cheesy lyrics. Learning To See isn't particulary inspired, but along with It's About Time, this song sees Van Halen moving into unexplored territory and pulling off a kickass hybrid sound. Overall, the first Hagar track is great, and the remaining two bring to mind something off of Chickenfoot's new album.     No need to go over a majority of the other songs here as we are all very familiar with them; surprisingly, I realized I hadn't heard Finish What Ya Started, and it too surprised me with its fresh uniqueness (although just like I had read, this track does cut off abruptly just before You Really Got Me). I'm not thrilled with the song arrangement on these two discs, and Disc Two is pretty inconsistent as far as the Roth/Hagar/Roth/Hagar order. I don't know why the three live songs from Right here, right now were tacked onto the end and although I can understand wanting to represent each of their albums, different songs (Hagar songs, by the way) would have fit better. Why use Roth-era tracks that already appear as studio versions earlier on? Another glaring inconsistency is the lack of any material from Van Halen III. I understandVan Halen purists in generally disliking VHIII, but I think it is a decent album except for the last three songs, and including their three singles from it (Without You, Fire In The Hole, One I Want) would have made perfect sense. VHIII doesn't even appear in the band's discography, and Gary Cherone is not directly mentioned in Van Halen's career-encompassing biography although a reference is made to the Cherone-era of the band that is said with derision. Disc One contains 19 tracks while Disc Two only tallies up with 17. Several other great hits that I expected to be here, such as (Don't Tell Me) What Love Can Do, Mean Street, 5150, Little Guitars, Judgement Day, Atomic Punk, In 'N' Out, etc. are nowhere to be found, and placing Strung Out before Not Enough is idiotic as a much more suitable instrumental could have been fit in like Cathedral or even Baluchitherium for crying out loud.    I think this collection falls short on many levels but for a newcomer to the Van Halen legend, this compilation works. It seems a lot like a cheap way of promoting yet another short-lived Van Halen reunion and hints to me of the infamous David Lee Roth incident of 1996, when the Van Halen brothers kept him around just long enough to record two new tracks for Best Of, Vol. 1 before giving him the boot. \\"Exit Roth, enter confusion\\" is a much more realistic take on things than what is presented in the CD insert, but these issues are petty and only detract from the album's quality on a personal level for me. The only other complaint I'm going to bring up is: wouldn't it have been cool to title this collection as \\"Van Halen Best of, Vol. 2 -The Best Of Both Worlds\\" for continuity? Nah, let's just forget about it! Most of the classics are here, so just sit back and enjoy the return of the MIGHTY Van Halen!    DISC ONE-    ERUPTION: 5/5  IT'S ABOUT TIME 4/5  UP FOR BREAKFAST 2/5  LEARNING TO SEE 3/5  AIN'T TALKIN' 'BOUT LOVE 5/5  FINISH WHAT YA STARTED 5/5  YOU REALLY GOT ME 5/5  DREAMS 5/5  HOT FOR TEACHER 5/5  POUNDCAKE 5/5  AND THE CRADLE WILL ROCK... 5/5  BLACK AND BLUE 4/5  JUMP 5/5  TOP OF THE WORLD 4/5  (OH) PRETTY WOMAN 5/5  LOVE WALKS IN 4/5  BEAUTIFUL GIRLS 5/5  CAN'T STOP LOVIN' YOU 4/5  UNCHAINED 5/5    DISC TWO-    PANAMA 5/5  BEST OF BOTH WORLDS 5/5  JAMIE'S CRYIN' 5/5  RUNAROUND 4/5  I'LL WAIT 4/5  WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE 5/5  RUNNIN' WITH THE DEVIL 5/5  WHEN IT'S LOVE 5/5  DANCING IN THE STREET 3/5  STRUNG OUT/NOT ENOUGH 4/5  FEELS SO GOOD 4/5  RIGHT NOW 5/5  EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! 5/5  DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY 5/5  AIN'T TALKIN' 'BOUT LOVE [LIVE] 4/5  PANAMA [LIVE] 3/5  JUMP [LIVE] 4/5    Let's hope the current Van Halen lineup really does come through with a great new album soon, and that the songs presented here always remain classics but only encompass relatively half of the band's career and not three quarters of it. I'm betting on all four of these guys living a long time, and they owe it to the world and themselves to get off of their laurels and rock for at least a few more decades to come!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was skeptical at first. But after I took an old rusty hunting knife and put a nearly razor sharp edge on it. I was convinced. This knife was in bad shape, (pits and large gouges along the edge) but the Pocket Pal restored it within 15 minutes. The serration rod works wonders as well. Light, compact and durable. I am glad I bought two of them. One for the tool box and one for the camp box.

B000LP6KSU|4.0|The artists wanted to produce something that was hard edged, emotive and the result is dark. Yet, this turned out to be a commercial product (probably unintentional) and you will pause to realize after you have given it a listen that it was worthy of another listen.

B0016KJKIG|5.0|I have the molle types, the leather sheaths and this is my favorite.    It is easiest to keep sideways and in the front of my belt comparing to other sheaths made for Surge, that I have used. My Leatherman Surge sits secure in this one. I feel it is the less bulky and stays in place the best.    If you use it a lot, the velcro closing will start to wear out eventually, but you can either fix it, put a snap closure on it later if need be, or just buy a couple of these sheaths.    As an added bonus, I found that my Garmin Quest and some cameras fits in snug - read perfect - too. So I got a few extra ones for non-surge usage as well.    Very handy little pouch, very functional, good price even shipping might be a little much for a single item. But again, buy two.

Warning: While the special code in each book does give you access to a test that gives you your top five strengths.

B001MS7IBS|3.0|Navigation seems REALLY clumsy.    I just got the discs in the mail and popped it in, but could not for the life of me could not figure out how to navigate to the second, third, etc. episodes on the disc and watch them. If you just pop the disc in, it auto-plays from the 1st episode. If you go to the Title Menu, it shows you Behind the Story for all of the episodes, but no way to navigate to the episodes themselves. There's also a Play Episode button there, but it just starts playing from the 1st episode.    I actually have tried two different Sony Blu-Ray players and got the same results on both.    Sure, you can start watching the 1st episode and just skip chapters to the episode you want to watch, but there's got to be a better way than that.    Okay, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but if anyone has info on how to do this, please comment to this post. My internet searches have not turned up any other posts from people having this problem, so I assume it's just me.
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol opens with Robert Langdon being called to Washington DC at short notice to deliver a speech. The request has come from his old friend, Peter Solomon, head of the Smithsonian Institution and also a high-ranking Mason. When Langdon gets to the Capitol Building, he quickly discovers that there is no event planned and that Solomon has not invited him. Instead he has been lured there because an unknown individual believes that Langdon can help him to unlock an \\"ancient portal\\" hidden in Washington DC. The first clue is delivered via a severed hand (Solomon's). In next to no time Langdon finds himself teaming up with Solomon's sister (a former romantic interest) frantically deceiphering clues in a bid to save his friend Peter, all the while on the run from the authorities - and also from a mysterious villianous eunuch with a distinctive tatooed appearance who is desperate to discover the most closely guarded secrets of the Freemasons.<br /><br />Whilst there are obvious similarities to The Da Vinci Code, The Lost Symbol focuses on new territory, specifically the world of Freemasons. Unfortunately, while interesting, the revelations lack the \\"wow\\" factor of The Da Vinci revelations. The Lost Symbol is still an enjoyable book, but it's not as good as The Da Vinci Code. I'd put it more on a par with his earlier novels.<br /><br />The book takes a while to find its momentum. The early chapters are cluttered with back story after back story. Also lots of \\"encyclopedia speak\\". Dan Brown has clearly done lots of research while writing this book, but do we need to be told ALL of it? Sometimes it felt more like I was reading excerpts from Wikipedia than a novel! The pace does pick up though, and Dan Brown is still the master of the hanging chapters that get you staying up late reading \\"just one more\\" - it's a long book, but you tear through it. You do need to be willing to ride with the (many) improbabilities, like the idea that Langdon could immediately identify the owner of a severed hand or that the CIA would let him help himself to criminal evidence or that he would totally forget that he was carrying a secret and vital box with him (until of course it was convenient for him to remember).  The ending is also a disappointment: it drags out and the main twist is unlikely to surprise.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, The Lost Symbol moves at a good pace and kept me entertained throughout. Ultimately it delivers much what you would expect it to and if you've enjoyed previous novels by Dan Brown, it's a pretty safe bet that you'll enjoy this one too.vered hand or that the CIA would let him help himself to criminal evidence or that he would totally forget that he was carrying a secret and vital box with him (until of course it was convenient for him to remember).

B001M5UDGS|5.0|After we finished this, my wife commented \\"who ever thought that Doogie Houser would be such a great actor?\\"  Neil Patrick Harris makes a fantastic Dr. Horrible, a wannabe bad guy who is actually much more of a good guy that purported hero Captain Hammer.  The criminally underutilized Nathan Fillion is a great Captain Hammer, the narcissistic superhero who is the toast of LA.  And who will ever forget Dobbin as Bad Horse, perhaps the greatest screen villain of all time?  Or the Moist Guy, whose powers of dampening and soggification make him a great henchman?  Joss Whedon makes all this craziness work, and on top of it some great songs make Dr. Horrible an excellent and entertaining musical.  You won't believe this is the same man who brought us the flat and joyless \\"Dollhouse.\\"<br /><br />At 42 minutes, Dr. Horrible doesn't wear out his welcome; had this piece been longer, it would have been far less entertaining.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|For all you guys that have been comparing Metallica vs Megadeth, this is a final statement. METALLICA HAD IT... MEGADETH HAS IT! I´m blown away by this record in a lot of ways and a bit blah! in others, but having to know the fact that Dave Mustaine is almost fifty years old and still can destroy and reinvent himself with the style he once invented, that alone is worth a 5 star review.     The record is very refreshing for megadeth. I probably say that I like United Abominations more that I actually did, but Endgame is just that forever awaited comeback album. This is easily the best Mustaine we have heard in 20 years. He´s technique is sharp and flawless. The riffs are crushing, precise, unpredictable, complicated, well thouth and heavy as hell. His solos are way more intricate and inspired (probably due to playing with such an extraordinary talent like it is Broderick). It just feels like Mustaine has been taking guitar clases to refine his mighty technique. This is the must \\"Mustaine album\\" since Countdown. Listening to this record it just make me feel like \\"wao! what will Dave bring to the table on his next record?\\". It feels like Dave has skills, power and inspiration for 5 more albums. Nothing sloppy here. But, if you listen to Death Magnetic, everything is so damn sloppy, recicled, out of place and uninspired. Metallica is just NOT into Heavy Metal anymore... they were of course, but just not anymore. Death Magnetic is an insult for what Metallica once was... Endgame is a triumph for what Megadeth was, and still is.     Death Magnetic is Metallica´s so call comeback album. Endgame feels like classic Megadeth.    Dave voice is a bit blown off, but still he manage to get his anger flowing and keeps the melodic lines interesting. Hetfield´s voice is just a shame! Blown off, predictable and pathetic.     The solos. Lord. Broderick is a MONSTER and what I really love is that he still uses some frases and voices in his soloing that reminds you to Marty Friedman( a huge inspiration for Broderick), so you still have that \\"Megadeth solo sound\\" that we happen to love. Not even bother to mention Kirk Hamment. In this day the guy is just pathetic.    I love the album. It could had been better, but still crushes like hell. I´m very happy for Dave coz this is a new Begining. There´s no need to compare Metallica with Megadeth now. This is just fantastic.     Can´t wait for Megadeth new record in a couple of years... keep it like this Dave, you´re the man!
0385504225|4.0|Let me attempt to explain why I titled my review as 'Both GOOD and BAD'...I was one of the few lucky ones who stumbled upon The Da Vinci Code within about a week after its initial release, and LONG before it became somewhat of a phenomenon. All I knew was, within about 25 pages or so after starting it, I ran out and purchased 'Angels & Demons'. The whole genre which Dan Brown seems to have invented single-handedly (I refer you to the DOZENS of similar-themed novels and at least 2 National Treasure movies--and counting), is no longer as 'original' as it seemed when DVC first hit the book shelves nearly 7 years ago.<br /><br />First off, poor Dan Brown has a few things going against him right out of the chute, in that 'The Lost Symbol' is instantly one of THE most anticipated novels in the past 20-30 YEARS--and with expectations like that, face it, the uphill battle of matching the first two Robert Langdon stories was lost probably before he even began writing it. The controversy found within those two books is easily more captivating--not to mention more controversial than this 3rd volume as well.<br /><br />Second it seems that in the years since DVC came out, people have (somewhat) forgotten that NONE of Dan Brown's books were of Shakespearian quality to begin with...most seem to recall the HUGE controversy sparked by the two previous books to remember with absolute clarity that while immensely entertaining & creative, neither book could be placed in the same category as Serious Literature, either.<br /><br />Strike Two.<br /><br />Let me say that had I not read 'Angels & Demons' or 'The Da Vinci Code' before picking this one up, I would like to believe it would easily be THE Must Read novel of 2009. Comparing 'The Lost Symbol' to the other two Robert Langdon stories--and lets face it, there is NO escaping the comparisons--it all depends on your personal perception on how where you will rank this one. Again, the whole 'originality' of the character of Robert Langdon is all but gone having experienced him twice before, and again in both theatrical films--so you kind of feel as though you already know the guy even before he makes an appearance, which is okay. The entire premise is based on Dan Browns own 'formula', one which he strays very little from here.<br /><br />I happen to LOVE short chapters, and if you do, too--the fact that there are over a hundred of them ought to make you thrilled. The so-called 'controversy' herein makes a much smaller impact (I believe) than what we had before...that isn't to say that it ISN'T interesting or even compelling, it just doesn't deliver the punch we have seen in the past from Mr. Brown. There is a LOT of info contained in the book and you can clearly see that a ton of research went into the history of the story, and again, before you expect the book to be anywhere near as original as the first two ought to be just thrown out the window before you even begin page 1. Also, one other thing noted by a few other reviewers: some suspension of belief isn't just a good idea, its downright necessary here. DON'T take it too seriously and I think that 'The Lost Symbol' is an excellent story and HIGHLY entertaining no matter what anyone else says. Keep in mind that opinions vary...otherwise, a very solid entry by Dan Brown.

B001GCUO1Q|2.0|While watching \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\\" I couldn't help feeling something is missing here, in this special effect-laden \\"prequel\\" to the \\"X-Men\\" franchise. It has a lot of actions, but though they are entertaining enough, none of them is really imaginative and some effects look a bit cheesy. It has a lot of characters (including young Cyclops), but none of them are really interesting with no plot or character development. But perhaps what \\"Wolverine\\" doesn't have is the soul - soul of the characters including Wolverine himself.    What you have instead is typical cardboard characters and uninvolving romance / revenge story. The new film tells the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), his half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) and Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy military organization. Sadly, the conflict or complexity within the characters that made the two Bryan Singer-directed \\"X-Men\\" films something special is totally gone. Victor and Stryker are both stereotyped (psychopathic villain and military villain) and Wolverine is the hero bent on revenge. Such a waste of potential.    But of course, it might be that the new film wants to be something different, something with lots of actions and visuals. The filmmakers (including Hugh Jackman himself as co-producer) are entitled to that. However, I don't think Gavin Hood (best known for his Oscar-winning \\"Tsotsi\\") is the best choice for that job. With poorly-edited actions and not-so-impressive effects, the thrills and suspense is half gone especially when most characters are too stupid to know the obvious results of their choice.     What \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" really needs is a good story with more complicated characters like Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier. And veterans like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (the latter seen very briefly) whose acting bring the characters to life.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|Muse have not only met the high expectations that came with this album but have surpassed it which may not amount to much with any other band but Muse.<br /><br />Absolutely amazing.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review when so many others are out there, but I felt compelled to do so this time since the reviews were so mixed, and I disagreed with some of what other Muse fans had to say.    Let me first say that I am a HUGE Muse fan!  I have everything of theirs that I could find/afford, and I totally love all of it.  The thing I love most about Muse is that their sound is completely different from every other artist out there, they combine so many musical genres together that they really can't be classified into any one specifically. Each album is so different, a progression, and The Resistance is no exception!    \\"Uprising\\"-Most likely you've already heard this entire track--it rocks!! I'll admit the very first time I heard it I wasn't 100% sure at first, but by halfway through I was totally sold.  It's a great song, the typical anti-establishment/question authority attitude that Muse seems to love.    \\"Resistance\\"-another good one, classic Muse!  Some say this one is a bit cheesy, but I didn't think so.  This is one of those Muse songs that you like more and more each time you hear it.    \\"Undisclosed Desires\\"-Ok, I really love this song, and I was really suprised that so many reviews trashed it!!! Lyrically it is fabulous, one of Muse's best love songs ever. The chorus is awesome. Musically, it it totally different than anything they've ever done before and also very different than the other songs on this album.  I don't think it sounds like Britney Spears, or like it was produced by Timbaland at all.  Nor does it sound like Hip-Hop.  Some reviews said it shouldn't have been on the album, but I strongly disagree!!  Like \\"Super Massive Black Hole\\", it is the kind of song that will likely have a broader appeal, I can definitely see it doing well as a single.  After listening to the whole album several times, so far I think this one is my favorite.    \\"United States of Eurasia\\"-My first impression of this song was, \\"Hmmm, I don't know, sounds too much like Queen\\".  I wasn't sure if I liked it at all.  But, hearing it a few more times, the only part that really sounds like Queen are the vocal harmonies of \\"there can be only one!\\" and \\"eurasia! Sia! SIA!\\".  The rest of the song is growing on me, I like it a lot more now, but I would say this is probably my least favorite on the album.  That's not to say it isn't good, though, this is Muse we're talking about. The orchestral parts are incredible.    \\"Guiding Light\\"-Good song, but not the best.  It will for sure get played a lot when they tour and I'm sure it will be even better live!  This is another one that I am liking more each time I listen to it.    \\"Unnatural Selection\\"-Here we go, this song kicks total [...]!! I read many reviews that compare it to other Muse songs (\\"New Born\\", \\"Citizen Erased\\").  Why, because it's over six minutes long? I don't think it sounds close enough to anything on Origin of Symmetry to compare it to those songs, but it is definitely equally good! One of the best songs on the album for sure.    \\"MK Ultra\\"-This is the best song on the album, hands down!!!! It completely rocks.  This will be up there with my all time fave Muse songs.    \\"I Belong To You (Francais, etc.)\\"-I heard about this song before the album came out, and it was different than I expected it would be.  A lot peppier, for example (I guess I thought it would be slower tempo).  It's a fun song, then gets a bit more serious and romantic with the part that is en francais. Then it goes back to the fun, and like another reviewer wrote, the clarinet cracks me up!    \\"Exogenesis\\" Parts 1, 2, &3-Spectacular!!! The crowning achievement of this album.  The opening of part 1 is haunting and beautiful, and only intensifies when the vocals kick in.  These songs are totally amazing, completely orchestral, but don't despair, rock fans, there's still plenty of guitar shredding going on too. Absolutely incredible, and I would expect nothing less being that Matt had been working in the compostion for several years.  Matt said in Spin Magazine that he didn't think the word genius could be used to describe anything in rock music.  Matt, I beg to differ.    Overall I think this album is outstanding.  The best? I would still rank Absolution, Origin of Symmetry, and Black Holes above this one, but maybe that's because I haven't listened to it enough yet.  Most likely it will be the only thing I listen to for a solid 2-3 weeks, just like every other Muse CD I've ever purchased.    So, the question is, should you buy this album?  There are many ways to answer.  This album is very different than the previous ones, but keep in mind that that is what Muse was going for here.  If you like all of Muse's other albums, you definitely should get it. If you're the type of Muse fan that loves Origin of Symmetry but didn't like some of the stuff on Black Holes & Revelations, this album might not be for you.  If you aren't familiar with Muse's work at all, I wouldn't recommend starting with this album.  I would suggest starting with Absolution and working your way up from that.
B000V6BE6M|1.0|I HATE THE AUDIO OF THIS SO MUCH. I FINISHED IT TODAY AFTER ABOUT 6 YEARS. I PUT IT ASIDE BECAUSE I HATED IT BUT IT ONLY GOT WORSE.<br />IT IS SO MUCH HORRIBLE BABBLE.<br />I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK BUT THE AUDIO IS MUCH WORSE.<br />TRY THE GREAT AUDIO OF HARRY POTTER INSTEAD.
B002NXPTDK|4.0|I'm not a fan of the superficial hip-hop music that floods the radio waves these days.  I gravitate more towards rock 'n' roll, anyway.  But after hearing such rave reviews of this \\"revolutionary\\" album, I decided to take a chance on the MP3 sale price ($3.99 at the time).    I must say that I do like the album.  It IS different, in a cool way.    MAN ON THE MOON plays like a concept album, with the tracks sharing a theme, taking the listener through the dreams of Kid Cudi (\\"the man on the moon\\").  The songs are generally slower and more haunting sounding than the party songs that come on the radio.  And Kid Cudi's lyrics are more serious and introspective.  These aren't songs that I can picture being blasted at a club.    I'm not much of an authority on rap/hip-hop music, but this album seems to have a more ecclectic musical feel.  It's not just about the rhymes; it's easier on the ears, you might say.    The album as a whole is stronger than its individual tracks, and it definitely seems like the type of album that will grow on you after repeat listens.  This is not what I've come to expect from \\"hip-hop music\\", and I was pleasantly surprised.  It's hip-hop that a non-hip-hop fan can enjoy.  And the cover art is pretty cool.    A very good hip-hop concept album with meaningful lyrics.  It lives up to its hype as a fully-realized effort to take the genre in a different direction.  Worth checking out even for the mildly curious.  Especially if you can find it at a sale price.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|WOW GREAT CD THE NEW BAND IS GREAT. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THIS CD RANKS AT THE TOP OF MEGADETHS LIST AND MUSICALLY IS VERY REALAVENT MOST BANDS AFTER THE YEARS FADE THIS IS A RE BIRTH.LET ME TELL YA I NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS STUFF IM 51YRS OLD HAVE 4 KIDS AND AM A SUCCESSFUL ENGINEER AND MAN LET ME TELL YA THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO RIDING A HARLEY ENJOY................
B000EULJLU|5.0|Well there's not much tool merch available in India so the only place I could source this wonderful piece of art without paying an arm and a lef was Amazon. Came in good time for snail shipment and was in absolutely perfect condition and packaging could take a bullet. Excellent product too. The album is completely worth it and the artwork will blow your mind. 5 stars.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I loved Angels & Demons and DaVinci Code and was really exicted to read The Lost Symbol, particularly as a DC resident and granddaughter of a Mason.   This was a disappointing experience for me and stretched credulity over the top.   The Japanese CIA lady, the one-handed friend/father of a lunatic madman, brother of a secret lab scientist weighing the soul, the \\"drowning death\\" of Langdon, the trip to the top of the Monument then the Rotunda????   What?????   All to end at the Bible???   I didn't get it and it was just too weird.
0385504225|4.0|Let me just say right off, that although comparisons to Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code are unavoidable, I think it's unfair to the book and the author to do so. I think The Lost Symbol should be judged on its own merit. I also think (respectfully) that all those reviews that keep saying that Dan Brown's books aren't literature are snobs and it's all a matter of preception and opinion.     The books opens in the Captiol Building in DC and is set and centered around many of DC's famous buildings and neighborhoods. Peter Solomon, a friend and mentor of Robert Langon, our Harvard symbologist hero, has been kidnapped and the villain wants Langon to solve a number of riddles/problems or Solomon dies.  All this is so this villain can become the most powerful man on earth by using whatever the Free Masons have had hidden all these years. Enter Director Sato, a small but quite powerful woman who heads another small but powerful department within the CIA. She seems a little full of herself but I guess I would be too if I had my own army, oops I mean CIA agents at my beck and call. It's an exciting chase that keeps the reader hooked but lags seriously in the last few chapters. The denoument is a little confusing and I think could have been edited for clarity and length. Brown mangled the simple message that \\"what we seek is within us\\" so badly that he wasted a lot of pages in talking in circles around the point. Think of all those trees we could have saved if he'd gotten me to edit for him....no, I joke.
0307454541|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it truely was a gripping page turner. I read it for book club and would really love it if we picked the next book in the \\"series\\"!
B002CMLIJ6|1.0|First I will give you my impression as a decidely biased comic fan... this movie was horrible.  The story was so loosely based on the actual Wolverine origin story that it was hardly recognizable.  My own personal opinion is that the rewrites they did not only to the character of Wolverine but also to the myriad of characters featured throughout the movie (and most notably Deadpool) were wholely unforgivable.<br /><br />All that aside, I do understand that the movie was not intended to be a simple comic to film rendition, but was created to be a stand alone which would meld with the changes that were made for the film trilogy already released.  On its own merits, the movie is still not that amazing.  The special effects are cheap at best, with most of the action being CG which is poorly laid over the original film.  The excellent effects for the claws from the original X-Men movie were simply not present in this movie, making them look painfully unreal.  The story is too long with far too many characters which receive little building or depth, and the acclaimed action packed scenes do not begin until half way through the movie and suffer from poor writing and unresolved endings.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slow, too long, and a waste of money.  If you are considering this movie for purchase... RENT IT FIRST, then make up your mind. It is a poor shadow of the prior movies.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|Ordered item on 8/17 and received on 8/25 in the new/excellent condition as stated by Amazon.  I always watch this movie on TV and wanted to have my own copy. You have to admire people who actually chase storms for a living whether for personal or scientific reasons. Prompt, fast, and courteous service always from Amazon.  Thank you!!!
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|Ok so I consider myself an x-men fan, I really do. When I bought comics that was one series I had to have. I enjoyed all the movies and to be honest I somewhat enjoyed this one. Except for a few things. I felt the movie was too short so there wasn't enought time to fully develop characters and plot. There are a few CGI shots that really don't work, like when you see is claws for the first time in the farmhouse, its like they didn't even try. There are a few comical parts that made me laugh like the six years later meeting between Wolverine, Agent Zero, and Stryker. Danny Huston's Stryker isn't anywere near Brian Cox's performance but he does ok. I would have like to have seen more of several characters including Gambit and Deadpool. A few of my friends and I agree that the movie is rather enjoyable until the very end of which I have two things to say that resemble spoilers the first is: If you cut off Cyclops' head I pretty sure his eye beams would stop. Ok the last thing is a spoiler: I mean honestly an adamantium bullet REALLY???? Its like at the very end the writers forgot that Wolverine loses his memory and apparently they thought that was how it should happen. FAIL.
1932907009|5.0|For anybody even remotely thinking of joining the crazy world of screenwriting. YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK. Blake Snyder is the master.Communicating to the Novice and seasoned writer. His untimely passing will leave a void. He has left some great insight and knowledge in SAVE THE CAT. From LOGLINE to Fade Out. You will be informed and educated. Just remember to credit this book and its writer. when you 'make it'.
B0006J28KU|5.0|As we all know, the film Righteous Kill wasn't the first time we have had two godlike actors together. True, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were both in The Godfather Part II, but they never appeared together onscreen. But here, we have them together onscreen for the first time, even though it's only ten minutes total. But this isn't the only thing that makes Heat so special.<br /><br />This is certainly one of Michael Mann's most extraordinary films, along with Last Of The Mohicans and Collateral. It's more of a psychological experience (with some operatic touches in the story) when you think about it. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a hot-headed Detective who is primarily obssessed with his career, which makes his personal life even more of a living hell. Neil McCauley (De Niro), on the other hand, is a calm professional thief who strictly believes in one rule: \\"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\\" That is, until a young woman comes into his life. These two figures of undeniable differences collide into what becomes an official operatic tragedy.<br /><br />This is a complete work of art. It's just as epic as the Godfather saga (excluding the length). I love how all the sub-plots are connected with each other, and how we get to understand many of the supporting characters. I especially love the shots of Los Angeles: the scenes in where the skyscrapers are in the background blend in almost perfectly. I especially love Pacino's sarcastic dialogue (\\"'Cause she got . . . a GREAT A**!\\"). I even love Dennis Haysbert's own little storyline, and how it relates to an even harsher reality. And don't think that I'll leave out the famous shootout sequence in the middle of the film, because I'm smarter than that. This sequence has got to be one of the finest action sequences ever put on film. The lack of background music makes it all much more realistic, the assault rifles and their echoed sounds are truly authentic, the bullet holes are spot-on, and even the fear and panic of the L.A. citizens become a welcome addition. By the way, Kilmer's reloading should be something worth watching. Why? Because it's bad@**!<br /><br />We've probably all seen Mann, Pacino, and De Niro's films more than once. This one I'll always rewatch until my DVD wears out. This is a classic film of the 90's. I can safely recommend this film to fans of Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Mann, action, suspense, drama, and even Moby.<br /><br />Grade: Ahoed sounds are truly authentic, the bullet holes are spot-on, and even the fear and panic of the L.A. citizens become a welcome addition.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|It is the worst of Dexter season, but it was still the one of the best show I have ever watched. All of the acting is as good as the last season. I only think that it is ok when looking at the rest of Dexter I think that the 2nd season is better. As I was saying before it was still very good TV.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|VHS? Of course I'm kidding (but not that far off). I know nothing about all the technical bruha about this transfer and that transfer and this quality and that quality. But it doesn't take a technophile to see how bad it looks does it? Just got my copy in the mail today. I ignored all the hate mail and bought it anyway as I love the movie. Don't we all. Ummm, yeah it's bad. Kinda off putting. I can see the Dreamworks Execs foaming at the mouth. Fortunately I live in Japan and Blu-rays here are $40 ~ $50 a pop so I can sell it again and get my money back. Too bad though as I really love the movie. I like these Amazon forums. Very helpful for my next purchase. 2001 is in the mail. Hope its good.
0399215921|3.0|Absolutely loved the book and story but was surprised that the book itself was so small.  This was a bit of a disappointment.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I think they were aiming to make a \\"Blair Witch Meets Godzilla\\" kind of movie, but the movie just plain sucked. And not in a good way, like Ed Wood, Phil Tucker or even Anthony Cardoza movies sucked, which in spite of being horrible were still entertaining. At no point did I feel any of the \\"suspense\\" they were going for, it was just boring. Thank God my DVD player has a \\"fast play\\" speed which allowed me to plow through this turkey in less than an hour, or I would not have made it through to the end. Lots of xtras on the DVD, but why would you want to watch a short on the making of a lousy movie. Maybe the \\"explaination\\" of where the monster came from in the first place was in one of the xtras, but I did not care enough to invest the time finding out. Deserves zero stars, but you cannot give it less than one.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Words cannot discribe how much I LOVE SEX AND THE CITY.  So, it was no wonder that I purchased the complete series once it was on the market.  I had the option of purchasing the complete series with other additions...I think it included memorabilia, etc.  However, the complete series (minus the additional stuff) was on sale and going for a very good price so I did not want to delay.  What I really wanted was the DVDs and not necessarily the additions so I went ahead and bought it.  To date however, I have not been able to watch the complete series because I have two children under three and life has been very hectic.  However, I am sure the DVDs will be good when they get older and I have more time, so I will definately watch the series....eventually.  The case provides a good cover and prevents dust from reaching the DVDs so that's good.  The item will have a LONG shelf life. Whether you are a Sex and the City fan or not, BUY THE COMPLETE SERIES NOW...YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????
0385504225|1.0|It's difficult for me to imagine that this book took a long time to write.  Cut and paste large passages from older books, update names, sprinkle in a few myths, some half-baked science and .... there you have it: a new Dan Brown novel.  Even Langdon seems bored with his fate.  Avoid this book.
B001AACEP8|5.0|The songs are catchy and Katy has a great, strong voice. Some songs are fun like \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" and \\"Hot n Cold\\", while others are more on the serious side \\"Thinking of You\\" and \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" (my personal fave). Katy is a wonderful addition to the music world and I hope to see her around for a very long time! Her personality makes her more lovable! Not to mention her tours/performances and costumes.
0425166805|4.0|I enjoy the ideas of another people. The book was completely fictional but I did enjoy hearing he's ideas. Chapter 2 really grabbed me it sets the tone for the book (I think).
067144901X|5.0|My daughter is 8 months old, we have been reading this book to her since she was 5 months old and it NEVER gets old.  It is the perfect length - long enough to be entertaining and relax her, short enough to keep her attention.  She really seems to enjoy the rhythm of this book, and every time I say \\"Three singing pigs say La La La!\\" she lights up and often giggles.  Now even if I say the name of the book she gets excited.<br /><br />When we first started reading it to her, she was more interested in the colors and the sounds that came out of her parent's mouths.  Now, she really follows our finger as we read, she examines the pictures, touches the animals when I mention them, and tries to flip the page when I am finished reading.<br /><br />The story is easy to personalize - we add our dogs' names, the names of the two bigger dogs who live across the street, and the last page I add her name.  I don't fully see why this book is more enjoyable than any other one in my daughter's library but I think it was one of the best shower gifts I received and I plan to purchase it for any other moms-to-be.  A total winner!
B0025KVLU6|3.0|Yes, it sounds good. It's the friggin' White Album. Is it better than the 1987 CD? Yes, a little, but after listening to each one briefly, popping them in and out of the player, there really isn't a dramatic difference. (Listening on pro studio equipment, btw). The bass and drums sound a bit better. The high end is slightly silkier...but I defy anyone to tell them apart blindfolded. If someone is just now noticing that the bass on \\"I Will\\" is sung, they haven't really listened to it closely before now, which leads me to this point: most of the reason people are saying it sounds so good is because they are sitting there focusing on it. As to the packaging, it is virtually impossible to remove the CDs from the tight little slits without getting your fingers all over the playing surface. I'm not crazy about digipacks anyway, and in this case, disappointed that the CDs are not protected better. If you love this album, get it, but don't expect miracles.
B0001I561E|5.0|We had to replace our Aladdin DVD. The Source was great and the movie was in great condition.
B001V9LRV0|4.0|I am 56 years old and remember Woodstock like it was yesterday. I was 16 in 1969 and just missed a chance to go to the concert, which was actually not that far away from Ottawa,Canada where I live. Anyway, over the years I have seen alot of different footage from Woodstock and this box set was pretty accurate. I thought there would have been more footage that is why I bought it, there were alot of bands not shown. But all in all I was satisfied with this box set and glad that I bought it.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|The Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade from the original version of this film. Haven´t read the comic book, I liked the film when I watched it at cinemas, but felt something was missing, maybe more soul. I was greatly satisfied to see this version completed in everything the theatrical cut. The story flows better since we get more information and character's development, so we are more easily drawn into the movie and even more interested. The three hours long weren't tiresome at any moment for me, which I think is something to praise the director, since we are watching a hero drama here. This is a more human film than the theatrical version also, you get more time to love and understand this broken people, the menace of the war feels more real, and the idea of how we men are uncapable of save ourselves, don't say the world, is much more implied.     My only  dissapointment is that the 2 disc DVD didn't come with the 3-d cover case showed in the picture, I don't know why. Yet, it was nothing to lessen the excellence of the film itself. Should have put on TV spots and trailers as well, I'm not the only one to think the second disc still had too much space to fill!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|The best ever! I highly recommend this purchase.  It come with an extra DVD with the original Billie Jean performance at the Motown anniversary show where MJ did the moonwalk for the first time on national television. In addition, there are remixes of his song where he is doing duets with today's pop stars, Akron, Fergie and others.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I bought this album because I wanted to support Whitney.  I had no high expectations, however, I was really pleasantly surprised at what I received.  No it isn't the powerful voice of yesteryear, but it is most definitely Whitney.  It is good music, tasteful lyrics, and a triumphant message, sung by a strong black woman, who has returned, against all odds.  I love the CD, and I don't think you will be disappointed if you buy it.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of the best pop albums produced in the 90's.  \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Under the Bridge\\", and \\"Breaking the Girl\\" are all enormously popular radio anthems by now, but every single song on this CD is great. This album has an energetic yet layered sound which draws you in . If you want some hard-hitting songs, try \\"The Greeting Song\\" or \\"Give It Away\\". If you want some songs you can just sit back and listen to, try \\"Breaking The Girl\\" or \\"I Could Have Lied\\". This album is definately RED HOT CHILI-PEPPERS best.
0385340575|4.0|I'm a big fan of Lee Child and read all the Reacher books.  This one had a little too much stuff in it that was not believable.  I guess in this day and age its pretty hard to believe that Reacher can live like he does with no address, no clothes, no cell phone, no ties to anything.  Plus the plot was a little far reaching, particularly the escape sequence.  Would like to see Reacher be a little more \\"of today\\" but nevertheless will continue to read.,
B002AFX52S|5.0|If you're a fan of classic Japanese film, this is a must for your collection.  The Blu-ray rendention is gorgeous, even projected on my 8-foot HT screen.  If you've never seen this film before, you'll love it's classic Japanese themes, beautiful costumes, epic scenes with thousands of extras, and of course, the fantastic Japanese cinematography that you'd expect.  As the saying goes, \\"if this is the sort'a thing you like, you'll REALLY like this.\\"
0385504225|5.0|Very similar to his previous books, but so what? It is a very entertaining book and that is all that should really matter.

B00003CXTG|1.0|As Trey Parker and Matt Stone put it in their song from \\"Team America,\\" this movie sucks.  It could have been a great story of this \\"day of infamy\\" but instead, Bay turned it into a sappy love story.  What, the history wasn't exciting and emotional enough? Boo.
B001UW58WW|2.0|David's performance is enhanced considerably when you can view his on-stage movements. He's very fast, quite innovative, extremely confident, and inspiring to young musicians.
B000P0J0DI|5.0|Received this DVD quickly and in fine shape...this is a good place to get quality DVD's. Very satisfied...
B001FBJULI|5.0|Well, I saw the new versions of the 5 Factory reissues of New Order's catalogue on London/Warner/Rhino at Boston's Newbury Comics...you can tell the new versions, as they don't have the clear slipcases, just shrinkwrapped with the stickers on front and back, and they include a second booklet with the contents of all 5 reissues...so to try it out, get my feet wet so to speak, I bought \\"Power, Corruption & Lies\\", as it has the 12\\"s of both \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"Thieves Like Us\\", as well as \\"Age Of Consent\\" and \\"Your Silent Face\\".<br /><br />Kept my fingers crossed.<br /><br />The album sounds great.<br /><br />Kept my fingers crossed again.<br /><br />Popped on Disc 2, Track 1, \\"Blue Monday\\"...the verdict???  It sounds fantastic, the remastering, and most important???  NO ERRORS!!!!!!!!!!!!  This should have happened back in November, 2008, but I guess better late than never, right???  The booklet's packaging is great, down to the fine details, the liner notes are great and a fun read, and the info booklet is great because you know what's in the other 4 reissues, what Factory releases they came from initially, and you can compare them with the boxset \\"Retro\\" and other titles you may have.<br /><br />So I then just bought \\"Low Life\\"...same thing, all great, even though the discs are reversed, like the label on Disc 1 should have gone on Disc 2 and vice versa...anybody else have this problem???  No biggie.<br /><br />Will be buying the other 3 in time, and the 3 Joy Division deluxes...but any word on when/if deluxes of New Order's other 3 albums will happen: that of 1993's \\"Republic\\" with \\"Regret\\", 2001's \\"Get Ready\\" and 2005's \\"Waiting For The Siren's Call\\"???  If not, I'll buy the regulars, but I need to know, thanks.<br /><br />In time...it's a green light on this corrected \\"PC&L\\"...and \\"Low Life\\"...buy it!!
B000001DWG|5.0|I first got this cd in early 90's, then loaned it out to a freind, never got it back.  I ordered it from Amazon, shipping, as always, fast, and the quality is perfect.<br />I'm at a lose for words when describing this cd, the band and what could have been.  If you love R&R, buy it, listen to samples and I assure you the samples are nowhere as good as the entire song.<br />If you like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, etc, thsi is a must have.  After listening to this 'Temple of the Dog' makes so much sense.<br /><br />RIP Andy
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown has once again graced our presence with Robert Langdon, symbologist extraordinaire. Having read The DaVinci Code 5 times, I am familiar with the writings of Brown, and my perceived personality of Langdon.     First off, as always Brown's research is compelling, and will open the door to many who do not know of certain books, sciences, and locales. In this regard, I love Brown's ability to pull all of this together. Though I would prefer it in non-fiction form.     The plot was so-so, I found the descriptions of the characters other than Langdon, weak at best. The history behind the characters is almost non-existent. In parts the plot was cheesy, and the story wrapped around the history and the non-fiction is not all that great.     All in all, a decent read, but I find the Sigma Force Novels by James Rollins, better written, the characters more interesting, with just as much science and history.
0385504225|4.0|The first Dan Brown book that I read was The DaVinci Code. I enjoyed it a lot, enough to read Angels and Demons, which I liked even more.     I went into this book expecting something similar, and wasn't disappointed in that respect. The plot was familiar enough, the pacing was faster, and the chapter cliffhangers were...well, omnipresent. I felt that the plot was weak. The other Robert Langdon books felt as if there was a specific goal in mind, and we knew the stakes from the middle, at least. In The Lost Symbol, we really only know the stakes in the last 50 or so pages. We're more emotionally involved in the characters than the plot, and when we do learn about the MacGuffin (aka plot device), it seems sort of shallow. We care, but only to the extent to which we care about a fraternity with which most people are unfamiliar.     The science behind this novel is...interesting. I'm unfamiliar with Noetic science, but I'm going to research it out of curiosity. If it has seen the results that Dan Brown talks about, I would be very surprised. I also don't know about the Smithsonian complex that Brown mentioned, but if it exists, I'd like to know more.     I have saved the content of the mysteries until the end, because frankly, that's the major appeal of these books to me.     In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I am a Freemason. My words and opinions are my own, and I do not speak for any other member, or for the fraternity as a whole, nor could anyone claim to.     Coming into this book, I was worried that Masonry would be treated the way the Illuminati were in Angels and Demons. As it turns out, I had nothing to worry about. Dan Brown was very respectful of the Masonic institution. We were never denigrated, or viewed with a negative or suspicious light. Even though the portrayals of our rituals (while incomplete, of course) were graphic, Langdon explained the symbolism and allegory very well. If anything, after reading this book, a person who had questions about Freemasonry would probably finish better educated.     That being said, this was a source of fiction. If Dan Brown is excellent at any one thing, it is making you wonder where facts and fiction separate. I had never heard of many of the \\"legends\\" mentioned. A conspiracy theorist would probably say that I'm just not in the right \\"circles within circles\\".     As many other reviews have said, this is a novel, not literature. It is absolutely an entertaining read, and the continual cliffhangers made it difficult to find an excuse to stop reading. Let go of your disbelief and enjoy the novel, because it is a fun way to spend your time.
B00192IV0O|5.0|Since I do not have any of their other CD's, I loved this. This is club hip hop music. I dont have to skip a track. From reading the other reviews, I am assuming they changed their music style some from their core fans. But, I love it. Jam it in the car!
B002FOQY04|2.0|This is one of the best produced albums I've heard in a long time.  The beats are sick.  I just can't get into this guy, he makes Kanye sound like Rakim.

When I listened to clips of each track I thought they were just playing the choruses, but thats actually his style.  Its more like a \\"spoken-word\\" album than anything else.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|PLEASE USE YOUR HEADS WHEN REMOVING THE CDs! I don't want anyone else to damage their CDs. Gently squeeze the top and the bottom of the packaging and the cardboard releases it's grip on the CD at which point it is easily removable. I've used this method on all of the newly released Beatles remastered albums without any issues. Great great new mix BTW! Brighter brights and punchier lower ends. Very clear. I Love it! Don't let the stories of people damaging their CDs keep you from buying this gem.

B002GZQYMA|4.0|Many mixed reviews in UK on \\"The Resistance\\", I received the album in vinyl box set form and have given it a few spins and very impressed overall, the band are trying to break new ground here but may puzzle some fans.    \\"Uprising , Resistance , Undisclosed Desires\\" are very catchy Muse songs in style, though during \\"United States of Eurasia/Collateral Damage\\" and \\"Guiding Light\\" I really thought I was listening to Queen, should that be a compliment ? \\"Unnatural Selection\\" is classic Muse, a standout track.    As something of a latecomer to the world of Muse I may be a bit more open minded and receptive to new ideas the band are trying, this album is not \\"Absolution\\" as they seem to have strayed into some traditional classical territory on \\"Exogenesis: Symphony \\"...    I really enjoy this section of the album, though I think it could alienate many fans. As something of a fan of classical piano music I noticed influences from Chopin (Nocturne No.9 Op.2), Saint- Saens and Rachmaninov came to mind within this piece, very few manage to meld Classical and Rock music successfully though they have managed it seamlessly in \\"Symphony\\", especially the opening movement - fabulous!    Overall the album package is very well presented (2Gb memory stick worth a fiver on Ebay), good quality vinyl but I wish they'd included the 5.1 surround DVD-A, then I would have felt I'd got my fifty quid's worth...
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This album is showing some new direction For Porcupine Tree and a wonderful sort of maturity. There is a wonderful sort of dynamics from screeming lead guitar to subtle Pink Floyd like haunting lyrics. As far as I am concerned this may be their greatest album. The songs are interwoven in a thematic presentation which pushes and pulls at you as you glide through the incredible swings in mood. The beginning notes of OCCAM'S RAZER followed by some acoustic guitar notes and then what seems like night animal sounds lets you know you're in for something alittle feaky and different. Running the tracks into each other produces an feeling of traansition of plot. The album reaches a fabulous pinnacle in the TIME FLIES segment  after which  they return briefly to the original theme before heading out again into mellow in OCTANE TWISTED. CIRCLE OF MANIAS returns with a heavy driving beat that won't let you rest. How any PT fan could NOT love this album is unfathomable.

B0026OE2O8|5.0|First, make no mistake, this is a must-buy for anyone with a large-screen HDTV and Blu-ray player; it contains the most stunning cinematography and sharpest HD available for home use. Secondly, it carries a message that should make it required viewing in any format, on any screen.<br /><br />That this is a film with a point of view is an understatement. The unrelenting gloom of the narrative during the first 90 minutes or so, playing behind some of the most stunningly beautiful views of earth ever committed to film, has led some to label it a propaganda film for environmentalists; and the film unfortunately encourages that charge by an unnecessarily preachy tone. The use of the second person, \\"You are changing the planet\\" versus \\"We are changing the planet\\" makes one wonder if the producers and narrator consider themselves not to be a part of the same human race whom they are addressing. Furthermore, although I am moderately environmentalist, I take issue with the assumption that nature is beneficent and that humans are the only thing standing in the way of nature. There are two things wrong with this view: (1) nature is often cruel and destructive, whether one looks at the evil inflicted by microscopic viruses or monstrous storms--man may in some cases make these phenomena worse, but man did not create them; and (2) humans are a major part of nature itself, not just some alien attacker.<br /><br />The producers of the film do attempt to strike a balance during the last 20 minutes of the film by pointing out what some countries are doing to slow, halt, or reverse the damage to our planet; but for both sides of the environmental debate, these 20 minutes come as too little, too late. The narrator states that it is \\"too late for pessimism\\" after a film that predominantly leaves the impression that it is too late for optimism, that it is too late for hope of reversing the overwhelming momentum built up by overpopulation in developing countries and overconsumption in the richest countries. One can only hope that the movie overstates the catastrophe that is already well under way on our planet; but even if the film's emphasis is skewed (I don't think it is), even if statistics are used selectively to drive its point home (probably true to some extent), and even if it got a few facts wrong, if even half of what it shows is correct, this is one of the scariest films one could possibly see.<br /><br />A review of this disc in terms of whether or not one should buy it, or at least rent it, could pretty much end here--just get it! If you simply can't abide its message, either for political reasons, or just because you don't want to ruin your day, then watch it with the sound turned off, at least for the first time through. But we ignore its message at our peril. (OK, now I sound preachy; but watch the film; too much of it is simply irrefutable.)<br /><br />To put on a critical hat, however, there are several things wrong with this film and its packaging. First I have to point out an irony: the Blu-ray version of this film adds its own little bit of environmental damage, and I don't refer to the natural resources required to produce and view it; these are more than justified by the positive impact it could have. Rather, I refer to the completely unnecessary and annoying use of Java to author this disk. This system prevents many or all Blu-ray players from being able to resume a video where the viewer left off; so if you want to watch half the film one day and the other half the next, you have to leave the player on, drawing a small amount of electricity, for as many hours or days over which you wish to spread your viewing. If you so much as press the stop button, you will not only have to wait through all the start-up loading (in several stages) and logos and piracy warnings, but also have to search for your place in the movie because not even a bookmarking function is provided. Many Blu-ray productions use Java to enable all sorts of bells and whistles, including interactivity over the Internet (\\"BD-Live\\"); but this disc has no special features; and I could see no benefit at all to the use of this obnoxious technology. To the producers: Use Java (make it do something worthwhile) or lose it!<br /><br />This leads me to another curious thing about this production: lavish as the photography is, the product is otherwise skimpy, with no program booklet and no special features on the disc. This would not be so bad were it not for the fact that many of the interesting places filmed are not identified in the narrative or by titles, at least not until the very end, where it is done in retrospect. Much of this information is available on the Internet, at [...], an English-language version of the French site; but the \\"Home\\" Book itself is only in French. It's impressive that the foundation made this very attractive and informative book available on-line with all its photography and charts intact, and you can begin to get a feel for the magnificence of the pictures right there. In addition, if you want to subject the film's allegations to a fact-check, this book lays out its statistics. Even if you are like me, and know only a little bit of tourist French, I think you can decipher most of the book, which is also available for sale in hardcopy.<br /><br />To be picky, there are lapses in the editing of the English narrative (faults that may not exist in the original French), with Close stating that there were no towns on Earth until 600 years ago. Huh? And she mispronounces several words, including \\"indefatigable,\\" \\"superfluous,\\" and \\"Qatar,\\" which leads me to hope that the fact checking was more thorough than the final edit of the English soundtrack. But I'm glad they saved money in these aspects rather than in the filming itself, which, I cannot repeat often enough, is spectacular; and even if a few factual errors may have slipped in, the bulk of the information is fascinating, shocking, and vital.ractivity over the Internet (\\"BD-Live\\"); but this disc has no special features; and I could see no benefit at all to the use of this obnoxious technology.

B00011V8CW|3.0|Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full?<br /><br />BLACK TIE WHITE NOISE understandably evokes mixed reviews.  I'm a little mixed up about how I view this album as well.  BTWN is more in the 3 to 3.5 range for me.  But frankly, Bowie hasn't had a uniform approach or reaction from his fans since his 70s heyday.<br /><br />BTWN wasn't really a comeback or return to form.  It was Bowie trying to give up pleasing the public and doing what he wanted.  Mostly.<br /><br />Nonetheless, within his musical palette, Bowie seems to try to do everything sometimes, and listening to this reminds me of Lodger which was experimental but slightly off-kilter.  It wasn't an album you could love or pin down.  BTWN is certainly more smooth as a listening experience, and reminds me of TONIGHT.<br /><br />What's good about BTWN:  Bowie trying to be fresh, and mixing it up, with jazz, funk, rock.<br />What's bad about BTWN:  Too much mixology...Bowie's warbling lower vocal range.<br /><br />I judge Bowie very much by how he uses his voice and how natural he sounds in each song.  Does the song's arrangement overshadow his voice or distract?<br /><br />The tracks that work for me:<br />- JUMP THEY SAY is one of Bowie's best tracks.  Smouldering underlying passionate pop coated with a deceptively distant veneer.<br />- NIGHT FLIGHT: Bowie sings in the right range for this one<br />- THE WEDDING: A sound and vision type instrumental<br />- MIRACLE GOODNIGHT<br /><br />The tracks that were a little too cute, a little overwrought for me, and which lapse a bit too much into Bowie's sentimental side.<br />- BLACK TIE WHITE NOISE<br />- DON'T LET ME DOWN<br />- I KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOMEDAY<br /><br />The rest are listenable...which leaves us (if you have the BONUS DISC & DVD) with the remixes of JUMP THEY SAY, which is actually better in so many ways and deserves 4 stars ****.  MIRACLE GOODNIGHT is much more transcendental here.  Think Bowie could do with more producers working with him.<br /><br />All in all, Bowie didn't do too badly, but whether this ranks as a glass half empty or half full is up to the listener.<br /><br />(BTW IMHO, Bowie's best album of the 90s would be EARTHLING)full is up to the listener.      (BTW IMHO, Bowie's best album of the 90s would be EARTHLING)

0679735909|5.0|I love this book. Though it's highly unlikely, it's almost as if A.S. Byatt telepathically peered into my mind, made a checklist of all the things I enjoy in a novel, and then wrote \\"Possession\\" accordingly. An historical mystery, a bittersweet love story, an exploration of myths and fairytales, a tribute to the power of books, and a beautiful, delicate style of prose all makes for an intriguing, rewarding, immensely enjoyable read.<br /><br />Roland Michell is a research assistant for Professor Blackadder, the self-proclaimed expert on all matters concerning the Victorian poet: Randolph Henry Ash. Whilst thumbing through one of Ash's old books, Roland uncovers rough drafts of letters, which seem to hint at a secret friendship with an unidentified woman. Since Ash was considered to be a devoted husband who led an exemplary life, this discovery could change everything that's ever been written about the poet and his work.<br /><br />His investigation leads him to suspect that Christabel LaMotte (known as \\"the fairy poet\\") is the mystery woman, which in turn guides him to a contemporary expert on the subject: Maud Bailey, the woman's great, great, great grand-niece. Together they take it upon themselves to secretly look into the matter further, both instinctively feeling that they're on the verge of an extraordinary discovery... In such a way, the lovers of the past are given another chance in the two people who uncover their story.<br /><br />To give away more would be to ruin the treasure hunt that follows; safe to say that it involves diary entries, love letters, old mansions, secret exertions to mystery locations, grave digging, a variety of secondary characters that provide help or hindrance, and finally a race to the finish line as competing scholars get wind of what the two are up to. Obviously, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this unraveling of the past's passionate love story has quite an effect on the scholars, who gradually loose their inhibitions and begin to open up to one another as the story unfolds. Through Randolph and Christabel's example, the ordinary Maud and Roland are allowed to do something extraordinary and seize their chance at life.<br /><br />Any scholar or theorist knows the excitement that comes with the thought of a new discovery, point of view, or even idea on how to view their chosen field of study. In many ways Byatt relies on this to convey a somewhat satirical view on scholarship and how one can get so wrapped up in analysis that they loose the focus of why they're devoting hours of their life to another person's work, and how literature is often dissected and deconstructed to the point where it looses all meaning, or is simply whittled down to banalities such as gender wars or sexual frustration. As Maud says: \\"Do you never have the sense that our metaphors eat up our world? I mean of course that everything connects and connects...and it's all reduced like boiling jam to human sexuality.\\" Likewise, Roland and Maud are so constrained by the ideologies of Freud that they're just as suppressed as anyone in the Victoria era, the two of them longing for \\"clean, white beds,\\" free of any meaning or relationships.<br /><br />And yet it would be quite misleading to say that the story revolves around Roland and Maud, for \\"Possession\\" is all about Randolph and Christabel. In her preface, as a way of explaining why the title is subtitled \\"A Romance,\\" Byatt quotes a definition from Nathaniel Byatt: \\"The point of view in which this tale comes under the Romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us.\\" That sentiment is this book in a nutshell, for the lovers of the past are far more vivid and real than the contemporary investigators, who cannot help but seem bland in comparison (which is probably intentional, considering that Roland and Maud themselves comment on this). They are the tools and mediators through which the Victorian love affair is conveyed.<br /><br />It is in the portrayal of Randolph and Christabel that Byatt truly excels, mainly because she's written an entire secondary body of text for them: diary entries, letters, essays, poems, fairytales and other bits and pieces (even a suicide note!) penned not just by the two poets, but their contemporaries as well. The love letters themselves are beautiful: stiff and formal at first, but gradually unfolding to reveal the personalities of those that have written them: Christabel's secretive and humourous prose, Ash's sensitive but unmistakably masculine thoughts. It needs to be noted here that a large portion of \\"Possession\\" is made up of these mementoes from the Victorian era, something that may test the casual reader's patience, but which are so poignantly and accurately written in regards to capturing the time and place from whence they come, that the line between fact and fiction is blurred considerably. I hate to admit it, but Randolph Ash in particular is inserted so seamlessly into the time period that I originally thought he was a real historical personage.<br /><br />The love story is heartbreaking and bittersweet, and even though it involves adultery (one of my pet peeves is glorified cheating on one's spouse) the significant others of both Randolph and Christabel are treated respectfully and not without mitigating factors of their own. Although there are three important segments of text which take us directly into the life and times of the Victorian characters, most of their story, in all its piecemeal chronology, is conveyed through the evidence that Roland and Maud uncover. There are some breathtaking conceits at work here, mainly concerning the fact that the poems of each lover take on a whole different meaning when one considers the romance between them; for example, when Maud and Roland discover that the exact same line exists in two of their poems as a hidden testament to their love, gone unnoticed by legions of scholars, hidden in plain sight for all to see - I have to say, my eyes pricked.<br /><br />Though I've always loved Byatt's delicate, beautiful prose, her complex syntax and heavily contextual style certainly won't be to everyone's taste. Though I've read \\"Possession\\" three times in my life, I know I've only brushed the surface of meaning at work here, for this is a difficult, cerebral, challenging book and relies on a lot of patience (consider for example the fact that one chapter is made up entirely of Randolph's poetry). And don't even get me started on the themes that the surround the titular \\"possession\\" - this review is long enough as it is!<br /><br />Although I concede that not everyone will enjoy this book, sometimes you just have to throw away objectivity and gush about the things you love. For me, \\"Possession\\" is one of these things. What stayed with me the longest was Byatt's comparison of the bliss and simplicity that comes with seclusion, and the equal bliss but far more complex emotions that come with the passionate madness of love, which in an odd way reflects my own reading experience of this book. In the sheer pleasure of reading, I found that, as a character puts it: \\"the author writes alone, and the reader reads alone, and they are alone together.\\"in the portrayal of Randolph and Christabel that Byatt truly excels, mainly because she's written an entire secondary body of text for them: diary entries, letters, essays, poems, fairytales and other bits and pieces (even a suicide note!) penned not just by the two poets, but their contemporaries as well.

0385504225|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews at all.  Yes, it is similar to the DaVinci Code.  Langdon figures out a lot of puzzles while in extreme danger racing around a world capitol.  But this book does it just as well, if not better, than the DaVinci code.  The Masons are more interesting than Opus Dei.  I am more familiar with Washington, DC so I felt more involved in the chase.  I feel more connected to the message of this book (the reach and the power of the human mind) than I did to possibility that Jesus had a child.  If you liked the DaVinci code, then I'm sure you'll like this.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I had been writing a pretty lengthy review here but for whatever reason my computer shut down boo hoo, anyway I'm pretty tired cause its like 3:00 in the morning so I thought I would just make this one short and sweet. Has anyone noticed that the beatles cd's play at a slightly faster speed which would raise the tempo a half step higher \\"half key higher\\" I bought four of the beatles remasters \\"rubber soul\\" \\"revolver\\" \\"sgt pepper\\" and the white album. I consider myself to have a relatively good ear in general and Im not a big radio listener but when Ive heard the beatles being played on the radio the songs get played a half key lower, to me they sound the way they should sound, unlike the way the cd's sound, another comparison is that I have a first generation lp record of the white album in stereo and there it plays a half key lower, again to me it sounds the way it should sound, then there's the beatles love album that I got awhile back that was mixed and remastered by I forget who and there too all the tracks were a half key lower so to me they also sound the way they should, that said if anyone has noticed this or if the mono version might be any different this way your comments would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe it's just me :)    I use to drive long distance alone very frequently and the various audio books of Jane Austin were something I would look forward to while driving.
0385504225|1.0|I pre-ordered this book, and expected to get it (as advertised) on the release date.  Imagine my surprise to find that I have a ship date of September 21.  I've spoken to Amazon customer service, which was no help, and the customer service representative said I should have ordered priority shipping.  I have pre-ordered on Amazon before with great results, even for Harry Potter and Twilight books.  It's too late to cancel the order and just pick it up at my local bookstore.  I didn't really want to wait until October to get this book, and am very disappointed in Amazon, especially the very rude service representative.
0486211045|4.0|Although a little too complicated for the  real beginner artist, this book has a wealth of information for the intermediate to advanced artist. At times the text seems a little  old fashioned and obscure  and is difficult to understand what he is getting at but most of the drawings are self explanatory and excellent teaching illustrations. Recommended.
B002CLBJUU|1.0|I went into a local store to check out the packaging for this 2-disc re-release, hoping that Disney would finally release a DVD of Grosse Pointe Blank with a new 16x9 anamorphic transfer.  This new disc appears to be the same disc that was released in 1998, and NOT a new anamorphic widescreen transfer.  On the back of the package, it still lists \\"Dolby Digital Surround Sound\\" and \\"1.85:1 Widescreen,\\" the same as it did on the original DVD (and the combo GBP/High Fidelity disc that came out later).  The new 2-disc release for \\"High Fidelity\\" lists the same bonus features as its original release, and showed as \\"Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions.\\"<br /><br />It appears the only difference between this release and the original 1998 issue is a second disc with a digital copy for portable video players and updated packaging.  I didn't end up buying it based on the packaging and won't until they release a proper version for 16x9 televisions (hopefully a Blu-ray).<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed that Disney would even bother to re-release such an antiquated, low-quality DVD with only the most minor of improvements (packaging, digital copy).  Even if they had not added any bonus features (the original release had none to speak of), an updated anamorphic transfer wouldn't be too much to ask.  Will absolutely not buy a copy of Grosse Pointe Blank until a good-quality DVD or Blu-ray is made available.
B000002IWH|4.0|Very often, music is placed in a movie at whim. It doesn't really tell the story, and listening to the soundtrack apart from the movie, one wouldn't even know that it is a motion picture soundtrack except for the title. This is not the case with The Crow soundtrack. The songs were placed in the movie to enhance the story at a level the is, in my oppinion, unsurpassed. Images of the movie will flash before your mind's eye as you listen to this soundtrack. My favorite track would have to be the first one, Burn by The Cure. It's the song that was playing when Brandon Lee was painting his face and really became The Crow. As passionate as the first track is, it is bookended by the melancholy It Won't Rain All The Time as the last track, which really serves to display the duel passions portrayed in the movie of both righteous revenge and hope for better things to come. In between, one hears a range of music from slower, alternative rock to fast hard metal. One that I particullarly like is Dark Souls by Nine Inch Nails. All that being said, I don't enjoy all tracks on this album equally, but overall, a wonderful buy. I would recommend this product to anyone who is a fan of The Crow, or a fan of alternative rock.
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|I thought the movie wasn't going to be as good as when I saw it at the theater, but it was awesome! The effects are still fantastic. And even on a classic i-pod, it's fantastic! The digital copy comes free with your dvd so how can you beat it! See this movie if you haven't yet. Definitely the best of all the X-Men movies so far!!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|It's a really good score, only wish it had more of Hedwig's Theme. I think this score is much better than The Half Blood Prince score. Personaly I wish John Williams would have composed the entire Harry Potter series.[[ASIN:B000OLGCHA Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]

0385504225|4.0|I received my copy of Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol from Amazon yesterday, 9/15 in the afternoon.  By 4:30 a.m. the following morning I had to stop at chapter 117 before my sleepless body forced my head to fall right into The Lost Symbol's pages.    The Lost Symbol is just as captivating as all of Brown's books:  DaVinci, Angels, Deception and Digital...  Most of the book is fast-paced and is comprised of short chapters that go back and forth between characters and events in a very thoughtful and interesting way.  Again, no different from Mr. Brown's other novels.  There were a few points where I started to get a little bored with the text, but just as the very hint of boredom approached, it was quickly replaced with page turning anxiousness to skip ahead and find out the results of something provocative that had just happened.  I really enjoyed the book, and I hope that Mr. Brown is quickly putting together his next work.    There were two things about the book that were a little disappointing.  DOING MY BEST NOT TO INCLUDE BLATANT SPOILERS HERE.  One was the threat revealed that could compromise National Security.  Although the characters from this aspect of the story were strong, I thought the actual threat itself was a bit weak. Secondly, there was a moment in the book where I thought Dan Brown made a bold move that set the tone for his future books - steering off the path his last three have taken.  Instead, I was fooled.  It's too bad - I would have liked to see Brown return to novels that are more independent of his latest series - like, say, Deception Point or Digital Fortress.  Maybe he still will, although this series is incredibly popular and I'm sure the Lost Symbol will go the way of the movie world as well.  So the theme and series is a cash cow for sure.    All in all a great novel by Dan Brown.  As great as his others - nooooooot quiiiiite, but very close for me.
0756405890|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than I've enjoyed a book in quite a while. The characters really came to life w/ all the detail the author was able to get across, especially in the dialogue. I can't remember the last time a read a book and had so many of my questions answered as I was reading it. In this book the author ensures you understand the motives behind actions. You often read a book and think the character's actions aren't realistic, but it isn't like that w/ this book.      I will read this book again, and I can't wait for the next one. Sure, there are few items that could be picked over if you really want to, but not really worth mentioning. This is a really good book for an adult who enjoys the genre. There is plenty of action, but it's a book w/ a good plot that unravels over time. I like the build up.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I generally do not review movies, but looking at some of these reviews, I am thinking to myself, did these folks see the same movie I did.  So first, my credentials-  I am a huge comic fanatic and own thousands of x-men and wolverine comics that I have been collecting for well over 20 years.  I also enjoyed the original x-men movie, liked number 2 better, and thought the last stand was very good on its own, but it messed around with the comic storyline too much for my tastes.  I really believe \\"the last stand\\", on its own would be considered great otherwise.     Now,  Wolverine.  I saw it in the movies, and got it on Blu Ray.  First, it is exciting as heck. It moves at breakneck speed and the battles are terrific.  Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan.  The story is pretty impressive.  I thought the script was intelligent, and the acting outstanding.  And it kept fairly close to the story line of the comic, probably as much as it could given that it is a movie. I have no idea what people are looking for.  They talk about it just being loud dumb and forgettable, and it is anything but.    Wolvering is the best action picture of 2009, better than 2008's Iron Man (I don't care what anyone says- Explain to me Why Wolverine is not great but Iron Man is, which was lots of action, and what else really, except some anti-war soul searching which is standard fare and treated with more complexity in a coloring book for 5 year olds).  Wolverine is maybe not as deep as the Dark Knight because it did not deal with themes as complex as those in the Dark Knight, but it certainly deals with heartbreaking loss, heartbreak and vengenace in a compelling and intelligent (not to mentoin exciting fashoion) designed to cover as much of the origin story as is reasonably possible for a movie.      Hugh Jackman was terrific as Logan, and LIev Schreiber was terrific as Victor Creed.  Lengendary villain if I ever saw one.  Yet I hear nothing about his acting chops.  Some of the characters like Gambit, who is an outstanding character in his own right, are given a more perfunctory treatment, probably because at some point you can't have a movie that's 17 hours long.      I truly believe that if you are sitting on the fence trying to figure out whether to get it or not based on the reviews, GET IT!.  Sit back and enjoy it.  It is an outstanding action film that hews fairly (although not completely) close to the comic. I tis an essential part of any action/comic fan's collection.     Wolverine is highly recommended.  Very highly recommended.
0375413405|5.0|Everything went great.  The book was exactly as stated.  It arrived promptly.  There were no problems.  Great seller.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first season, which I completely missed on TV here in Australia but became hooked on the second season so that's why I bought the first season. It was great to see how all the different characters met and to see how well they get along. I wouldn't of thought a bunch of geeks together could be so funny but was gladly proven wrong.     It's great that when you watch each episode you feel that you can relate to each of the characters at different times as you feel your inner geek come out, even if you don't admit to anyone.     I think the actors hired to play the different characters were perfectly chosen and it is clear that they have a great time together. I look forward to getting the second season, bring on the laughs I say.

Sound qualify is fantastic!!!

0375413405|5.0|The book is a classic, and even though the receipes are long, I love the fact that Childs explained everything so well. ANYONE could cook using this book. I also like the fact that Childs explained basics of techniques and recipes -- for example, that the base for a mornay white sauce is the base for many other sauces as well. There are recipes substitutions and chapters on cookware and equipment, which explains the pros and cons of copper clad, etc. Even if you never cook anything fro this book, you'll enjoy reading it and having it in your collection.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie is great for both kids and adults. Classic Disney at its best. I don't know why this movie is so difficult to find new however.
B002K8BLSA|2.0|It's almost a sin to say that I'm a bit disappointed with this release. The production on these tracks is lacking. It sounds very 'home studio' to me. The lyrics and the song writing are, of course, still strong. There's too much religious phrasing for my taste. It's bordering on a 'Christian music' album.    Paddy's vocals sound good, and there are moments where I think to myself 'yes! that's the Prefab Sprout I know and love'. I miss the sound of Wendy Smith. The bass guitar and the drums are missing here. It's all either samples or synths.    I listened to the album all the way through, but found myself skipping tracks after 20 or 30 seconds. The religious lyrics got to be a little much. Musically and melodically, it's brilliant. I'm going to give it another listen today. It's hard to top gems like 'Steve McQueen/Two Wheels Good', 'From Langley Park to Memphis' and 'Jordan: The Comeback'.    The new album lacks an earthiness that was usually present in Prefab songs despite the 'glitzy' production and breathy harmonies.    This album just doesn't seem to deliver the bliss and the angst and pure joy of well written pop music.    I'm disappointed. I've looked forward to this for so long. Maybe my expectations were too high.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|I liked this. Unsure because reviewers in the papers like it so much and they are usually so tragically wrong. It may slide downhill, but I like the cast - especially \\"Jeff\\". Thank you, Amazon, for the introduction.
067144901X|5.0|My wife and I have been reading aloud to our daughter almost since we brought her home from the hospital, and we credit Moo, Baa, La La La! for helping her say some of her first words.

Sandra Boynton's board books are one of the reasons our daughter loves books, and there is no greater praise we could give an author than that.

A good place to keep your thoughts on gratitude, I think.<br /><br />Any \\"blank book\\" would work here, but this is something a little nicer, in my opinion.  If you're going for abundance, go all out with nice things to keep your thoughts in! :)  This small step will help you to create abundance in your life.<br /><br />How I Use It - I am a big fan of the \\"Artist's Way\\" book and one of the things suggested in that book is to write every morning.  I have found doing that with this book is an excellent way to start my day.  It really gets me off on the right foot.  It's also a great morning routine, which gives me a little \\"space\\" in the morning, so I am not feeling so rushed.<br /><br />If you make it a daily habit, you will find the process effortless.  Well worth the time investment.<br /><br />I really love this book.
B0006GAO5Y|2.0|You have to give Sylvester Stallone credit for writing himself a starring vehicle, and then getting it made. He also more or less created the \\"Sports Underdog Triumphs  In The End\\" genre. That said, that fact that this embarrassingly over-acted film beat out ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, BOUND FOR GLORY, NETWORK and TAXI DRIVER for the  Best Film of 1976 is absolutely mind-boggling, and becomes more so with each passing  year. Strictly for Sly fans, and anyone who wonders what was in The Academy's drinking water that year ...

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I can sympathize with those who are upset with the remastering of the Beatles albums.  The original recordings are so iconic that changing them in any way would seem akin to retouching the Mona Lisa or rescoring Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  But that said, this is absolutely the best that the Beatles have ever sounded to me.  Individual songs come alive in ways that I've never heard before.  And this is as true of very late albums as early ones.  Listening to a song like \\"I'm a Loser\\" or \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" from BEATLES FOR SALE seem fresher and more detailed than on my older CDs.  And even later albums like ABBEY ROAD (which I must have listened to three hundred times when I was 16) seem incredibly new.  There are definitely a number of changes in the arrangement, in particular in decreasing the degree of separation between the channels.  So it has been changed, but being as honest with myself as possible, I have to acknowledge that in nearly every instance I like the changes.  Using headphones I found many of the original versions to be somewhat irritating, with the instruments segregated radically to one or another track.  They are still separated, but this has been decreased to a degree.<br /><br />But mainly I'm just blown away by the clarity of the recordings.  There is just so much more detail in all of these cuts now.  When I was a teen, I went through a Beatles phase that was only matched later by a Dylan phase that I went through in college.  Songs that I listened to hundreds and hundreds of times reveal nuance and detail that I never experienced before.<br /><br />Each individual lover of the Beatles is going to respond differently to these remasterings.  Theoretically, I'm bothered by the notion of remastering to this degree.  Pragmatically, I loved what they've done.  Unless you are violently opposed to the idea of rearranging songs by the Beatles, I strongly recommend this box set to lovers of the Beatles.  If you are violently opposed, I still recommend trying to stay open minded to these discs.  Either buy a single disc and give it a try or borrow one from a friend.  Give them an honest chance.  You may find that, like me, you are theoretically bothered by what they've done, but, also like me, that in practice you find you like what they've done a very great deal.  This is definitely my choice for best album of the year.ay open minded to these discs.  Either buy a single disc and give it a try or borrow one from a friend.  Give them an honest chance.

0385504225|2.0|I have liked all the Dan Brown books I've read, but this one was HUGE disappointment. I'm interested in history, art and architecture, and that is why I liked the Davinci Code and Angels and Demons so much. This book however has very little interesting history and an enourmous \\"so what\\" factor. The story builds and builds and then fizzles into a boring anthropology/philosophy lecture. I'm so mad I spent money on this book. Don't waste your time with this one.
0547258305|5.0|I ran across this book browsing the racks at Target, and was so struck by the inside cover discription of Po's eyes that months later, when I actually had time to read, it was the first book I thought of.    I liked Katsa for her intensions and mercies even before I was drawn past the dour facade to see the inner woman, something I feel Cashore did intensionally. It made it very easy to see how this young woman, has protected her heart while being forced by her uncle to use her Grace to the harm and violence she abhors, and to feel her struggle to see herself as more than \\"Randa's thug\\", \\"a monster\\" or something \\"un-natural\\". Cashore hints at all that lies within Katsa, and then uses her relationships with other characters, particularly Raffin, Po and Bitterblue to show her journey away from all she fears herself to be toward being what she wants to be.    Po is a man I could picture easily in my mind's eye, yet still he held surprises. I liked his strength and skill, but what was most wonderful about this character to me is his ability to allow Katsa to be strong without it diminishing him. I think that too few books for young adults allow strong-willed, capable young women to believe that their strength does not have to be a liability when it comes to the opposite sex - that they do not have to make themselves less or even pretend to do so in order to be found attractive. I liked that Po let Katsa excel without feeling humiliated, and was strong for her when she needed him to be without feeling or acting superior.    My one caviot, is that Katsa is very anti-marriage. I don't feel that is really a problem, though, for two reasons. First, in the world of this book women - daughters and wives alike - belong to men. A man grants his wife and his daughters protection and freedoms as he choses, either a lot or a little as seems good to him, irregardless of their feelings, needs or desires. Since this book is set in a pre-industrial time, that is not unusual and indeedwas the norm well into the 20th century. Second, as Katsa lost her parents as a toddler and was raised as the captive and servant of a tyranical king, the idea of giving up her freedom to another man, even one she loves with every fiber of her being, is naturally abhorant. Any person recently freed from such a position would find it unthinkable to go back into a situation that bore any resemblance to it, and so it is with Katsa. I find myself wondering if at some point in the future, having given every other part of herself to Po, she might lose the fear and desire marriage, or if they would simply build a life with ties visible only to themselves that would last throughout their lives.      I read it, then read it again, and then a third time in the course of a week, each time finding a new laugh, a deeper understanding of the characters. I'll likely read it again at various times through out my life, as I have always done with the books I truly love and I'd happily recommend this book to anyone, but especially to smart, capable women.
B0000025OP|4.0|Planet Waves falls under the category of good, not great. Lyrically it's a step down from other Dylan albums, but the vocal melodies are a significant improvement over Self Portrait so the album lies somewhere in the middle for me.<br /><br />\\"On a Night Like This\\" is an upbeat rocker with hoedown qualities. You can picture someone dancing in a barn thanks to the violin arrangements. \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" has a really emotional verse melody that's almost devastating to hear the way Dylan sings it. The slow nature of the rhythm is right on the money. I wouldn't want it any faster. That would ruin the magical flow. \\"Tough Mama\\" is a WONDERFUL rocker where Dylan even escalates his vocal range. The imaginative lyrics are most welcoming too. A good portion of this album lacks quality lyrics but not so here. It's a classic. Oh, and am I imagining things or is Dylan saying \\"Hotter than a crotch?\\" near the end?<br /><br />\\"Hazel\\" is a standard ballad. Around the 1 minute and 20 second mark, Dylan extends his range to a soaring degree and it sounds WAY off. Not natural at all for his style. \\"Something There Is About You\\" has a pace that moves slowly and beautifully. It's a ballad with colorful and meaningful lyrics about Dylan finding love. \\"Forever Young\\" is a cover of Rod Stewart's version. NOT! Two completely different tunes. The aspiring lyrics about young people seeking a positive and courageous lifestyle and growing up the right way are fantastic. I like the way the verse melody is really soft and innocent and then BAM, a loud chorus. Now the next song, \\"Forver Young (Continued)\\", is NOT so good. This is the theme song to Parenthood, that drama show that comes on Tuesday nights after the Biggest Loser. I actually thought that version was a more updated version that Dylan recorded for the show, but apparently it's THIS version serving as the theme since they sound identical. Anyway this is a more upbeat version of the previous \\"Forever Young\\" and it's worse. MUCH worse.I simply don't like the way Dylan sings the verse melody. Maybe he's trying to turn it into an upbeat country song, I dunno.<br /><br />\\"Dirge\\" is the second best song on the album. Haunting lyrics and piano work, Dylan seems especially angry and emotional on this track. The Spanish-sounding guitar work is appropriate and awesome. \\"You Angel You\\" is an uplifting country song with a steady, rocking beat. Terrific. \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" contains an unusually pretty vocal melody by Dylan's standards with a hint of blues and country thrown in the mix to make it more distinct from, not just the rest of the Planet Waves album, but the rest of everything Dylan has ever done. It's a bit of a strange song but hey, I welcome strangeness with open arms. \\"The Wedding Song\\" has more of those upfront and haunting vocals similar to \\"Dirge\\" and dare I say, even includes shades of Blood On the Tracks due to the thick and serious atmosphere. I like the lyrics too. \\"It's never been my duty to remake the world at large, nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge, 'cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend, and if there is eternity I'd love you there again\\". Beautiful!<br /><br />Overall, it's not a classic in the same league as previous Dylan albums from the mid to late 60's, and you'll have to accept less than spectacular lyrics on everything except \\"Dirge\\", \\"Tough Mama\\" and \\"The Wedding Song\\" but it's still a pretty decent album in its own right.
B002NHIK1E|4.0|Just finished watching the pilot and overall, I liked it. I think it's a show I can really get into. The look of the show is great. It's what you would expect from a vampire show with the deep colors, especially red and people wearing a lot of black.<br />  It's hard to comment on the story yet. But it seems like it could get very deep. Each character seems to have a lot of issues to deal with on top of the every day high school stuff, and there is already plenty of conflict between a lot of the characters. Conflict between Good Brother and Evil Brother, one girl gets jealous of another and has to deal with it, and brother and sister have to cope with the loss of their parents, relationship issues...it's all here, but now with dak vampire storylines mixed in.<br />  I'd say this show would very highly appeal to teenagers but can be enjoyed by anyone.<br />  I also love the classic CW formula of playing great music in the show to deepen the emotional experience and to add to the insight of the characters.<br />  I'm looking forward to seeing how the story will play out. I don't have any overall expectations or comparisons to make because I have not ever seen any of the Twilight movies or read the books and the same goes for the True Blood series as well. So, I have nothing to compare this too.<br />  I'll update my review when I get through a few more episodes.

0385504225|1.0|I wasn't expecting that much going in, maybe a few laughs. But I certainly wasn't expecting The Lost Symbol to be so incredibly and consistently bad. It's a flat-out snooze fest - except for the final 50 pages, which are like being harangued by a drunken madman on a crypto-evangelical soapbox. And excuse me, \\"bringing sexy back\\"? What was Janet Maslin smoking? The main characters seem as neutered as the bad guy. Intended as a paean to Western occultism - which could have been an interesting subject in more capable hands - the book devolves into an extended advertisement for \\"Noetic Science,\\" a.k.a. science-lite superstition for gullible submorons. If you need further proof of what Brown got sucked into, trip over to [...] - this is \\"What the Bleep?!\\" and \\"The Secret\\" territory, folks. On the other hand, if you enjoy that sort of mysterious handwaving and magical thinking, The Lost Symbol is your motherlode.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|This movie was simply suberb as an adaptation AND as a movie.  I have enjoyed them all as movies, but Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire can sometimes make us Potter fans cringe.  David Yates has got it right and I am very pleased with his work on Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince.  I trust Deathly Hallows will be just as good :-)    AAAnyway, I really wanted to post this review to let everyone know that the movie is expected to make a December 8th DVD release-- a great way to celebrate whatever it is you celebrate in December :-D
0385504225|1.0|I find it astonishing that Dan Brown could get away with a re-play of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by merely changing the location of the story from Rome to Washington,  where we already have too many Freemasons - like David Axelrod. This Godless, corrupt society is already broadcast over the main-stream news. I don't need to read about it in a poorly written book.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I remember when this movie was first released, it came on the heels of the original \\"Spagetti Westerns\\" staring Clint Eastwood. The director Sergio Leone, became very well known in America for his success with those movies but for whatever reason this one did not do as well in intial release. As time as gone on it has become appreciated as one of the great mythic Western movies.     How much this movie has to do with the true history of the West? Some reviewers have said not much, but in fact the expansion of the railroads was a huge driving force the the second half of the 19th century, not only in the West but in the entire United States. Cities like Chicago and Kansas City owe much of their success on being rail hubs to the West and Southwest. I have no doubt scenarios like the story line in this film actually took place, because rights of way and access to water were key and invaluable in building the railroads. No doubt blood was spilt more than once to win the right to lay track and get water.     As far as the casting, it is wonderful. Henry Fonda playing against type as a really dispicable bad guy is great. Of course the settings, vastness of the landscape, the music, cinematography, directing...well if you like Leone is is awesome. Claudia Cardinale was a stunning beauty who did a great job in this film. Give it a try you'll enjoy this film.
6305609705|3.0|Apocalypse Now is a powerful film, but not as great as the sales promotion would have it. The director's over-reliance on lavish set craft visually detracts from the psychological and moral tension the screenplay presents. Cinema can deepen discernment of the dilemmas posed by war, but it can also be a gratuitous expression of the film-makers' vanity. This film strays back and forth over the line, and where it strays forth it looks like another Indiana Jones thrill/horror ride.    The crux of the screenplay is this: confronted with horrors (savagery  beyond all previously experienced), what does a person do with the powerful feelings resulting? For some the pain of warring overcomes moral learning, with one possible consequence being the determination to \\"out-savage\\" the savage. Once over this line many an individual, including the previously virtuous, fall into the habit of violence. We see this in direct (hostile) and indirect (suicidal) reactions expressed by soldiers suffering PTSD in the wake of horrors of war.    In Apocalypse Now the \\"protagonists\\" are psychologically damaged men, one ruined by PTSD and malaria, while the other on his way as a consequence of an illegal (military assassination) assignment. We never see the \\"antagonists\\" (Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops); we only hear them on the periphery, mainly in the form of exploding ordinance. We see plenty of civilians falling before the atrocity of napalm bombing and arrogant strafing from helicopter-born cavalry. Call it hell-bent-for-leather staging, which is renowned for its appeal to the subliminally morbid tendencies of war hobbyists in the U.S., and beyond. The only value in the film's infamous surfing scene is to help set viewers up for the appalling \\"normalcy\\" of subsequent atrocities.    Despite the film's melodramatic staging, the protagonists grapple with their deathist ideologies. The maddened American colonel chooses (assisted) suicide, while the assassin feels (at some well-constructed depth) pain in serving the equally mad command to kill the colonel, on the grounds that the colonel's methods are \\"unsound\\". If you're capable of critical thought you see the elephantine irony right there: assassination deployed to create a \\"sound\\" military situation. In this light this film actually succeeds in asking the important question.    In the wake of Bush/Cheney Administration's determination to waterboard (and otherwise torture) antagonists into submission, (post 9/11/01 crimes of atrocity) we can see that the American body politic hasn't learned much from Apocalypse Now, or the wars on Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan and Iraq. The beatings and butcherings go on, unexamined, in hearts guided by darkness.
0307266303|5.0|Easily one of the best books I've ever read. It's packed with information on improving your health and running. Well researched, well thought out and a very compelling page-turning story. You don't have to be an avid runner to enjoy this book, it's a great story, it reads almost like a fiction. The book makes you want to go out and run 20K.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|When you pick up a Dan Brown book, you realize it will be far from great literature.  At best you hope for some good action scenes and a mystery that is fairly interesting to learn about.  Lets face it, Dan Brown is Umberto Eco dumbed down to the common denominator.  But who really cares, it is entertaining.<br /><br />Sadly the Lost Symbol drags with a certain amount of sameness as his other Langdon stories.  Here is poor hapless Robert Langdon, running from the cops, with the help of a brilliant female lead, directed by an older brilliant man, being chased by overdone psychopath.  And sadly, the quality of the writing is about as high as my previous sentence.<br /><br />Angels and Demons began the formula, Da Vinci Code rose above it with very interesting subject matter, Lost Symbol just wallows in sameness.  It is not without its pleasures, one particular action scene taking place in a pitch black chamber stands out as one of the best, but you have pretty much already read this book.<br /><br />I'm not going to stop anyone from reading this, nor would I particularly want to.  But six years worth of hype leaves this book feeling extremely flat.  Its probably time to retire Langdon while he is ahead.
B00003CXCT|5.0|had ordered it as international shipping....arrived before time and in perfect condition. love these movies. they had the new additions made with hayden christensen inserted in the return of the jedi as the ghost at the end.
6305327041|1.0|I am a great big fan of Quentin Tarentino, however this flick was a super disappointment for me. It was not funny and seemed to have very little direction.
0525951113|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and found the first couple of pages slightly heavy going. There on after, it was a book that could not be put down!    This is the best book I have read in years: a thriller with twists and turns and something that is completely original, in my book reading experience. Suarez pulls off a modern day thriller with a supernatural twist that nobody can compare with. It is so different, it is almost visionary. Who would have thought that citrix could spawn such a fictional monster?    If there was ever a sequel, could it live up to this legend?
B00005JLRT|3.0|This movie seems to catch a lot of flack from Star Trek fans.  To hear them tell it, this movie single handedly destroyed the entire Trek franchise.  As someone who has seen every Star Trek episode ever produced, and all 11 films, I can tell you that Star Trek has had its ups and downs all the way through it.  Every series has more than a handful of mediocre to terrible episodes, and it seems like every other movie is bad.  Having said that, I love Trek anyway.  This movie is certainly not the best of the lot, but it's much better than Insurrection (the previous film), and I think it's better than Generations too.  It's certainly much better as a Star Trek film than the new JJ Abrams film.  My only complaint is that it favors action more than story, and the writers didn't give Worf and Geordi much of anything to do.  But, the action is well done and exciting, and there aren't any weird moments of characters acting out of style.      I would have liked to have seen a better send off for the Next Generation crew, but this is not the abortion that a lot of fans will have you believe.  I think the problem is that a lot of people were simply burned out on Trek by the time this movie was released, as it had been coming out non-stop for 15 years by the time this was released.  If you enjoy watching Star Trek, and especially if you like the Next Generation cast, you will almost certainly enjoy this movie.  I would say that, as far as Trek goes, this movie is close to par, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely thrilling.      I give Nemesis 3 1/2 stars.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|This was the 3rd Stephen King book I've read, and the first that's non-fiction.  I found it to be remarkably well-written, and enjoyable.  He has down-to-earth, common-sense advice that come from experience, and doesn't pull any punches.  As a relatively new published author, I found the advice and anecdotes very useful.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|I do not read the comics as most people who watch comic movies. This movie very little back story and even a hour into the movie I could not figure out what the purpose of the movie was. Super heros who rape and murder? Are they even super or just people in a mask? On top of all that the violence was more for shock value then adding in to the movie. I bought this used for $[...] and still feel I over paid. I vote this a skip.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Very good graphics.  Got this in record time and loved it. Totally would recommend this to any FF fan out there.
B00005JPNY|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE AND EXCELLENT EDITION! IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE HARRY POTTER MOVIES, RETURN TO OZ, THE DARK CRYSTAL OR THE LAST UNICORN , THIS IS A MOVIE TO ENJOY. THIS IS A BIT OF THE ALLEGORY AND HIDDEN MEANING ALONG WITH FANTASY IN THE STYLE OF CS LEWIS MEETS DAN BROWN. PARENTS AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES CAN ENJOY AND EXCAPE TO A STORY THAT MAKES YOU THINK, IMAGINE AND LIVE IN A GREAT EXPERIENCE!
B000002IV8|4.0|If you've ever taken a \\"RISK\\" through purchasing a \\"LOAD\\" of albums, which don't quite exhibit the \\"X-FAcTOR\\", then you could continue this \\"FORCE OF HABIT\\", or start a new \\"RITUAL\\" by getting Overkill's I Hear Black. Overkill's tempo  here is often slower than their prior releases. However, the album is still saturated in good old fashioned heavy metal. great guitar sounds and Bobby's vocals are just right for the job at hand. Just the ideal disc to spin, when you are looking to take a breather from headbanging to all those other Overkill discs you own!
B000KKUN0M|5.0|This is so overlooked and its a shame that they do not sell this in the United States. It is a Region 2 dvd, but if you get the code taken off your dvd player, than the dvd plays. I watched this movie/long music video years ago on cable and i loved it. Now that Michael Jackson is no longer with us, it is a great treasure to add to your collection.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|This is my first experience with the remastered CD's.  I'm a little disappointed.  Listening to it in the car, I found that I had to turn the volume way up compared to other CD's.  The sound is a little weak and tinny.  Great Beatles classics, though I'm not enamored with Blue Jay Way.  I can see why it wasn't a huge hit.  Compared to today's CD's this one is awfully short, which I guess is typical of music of the era.
0446560065|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book.  Simon Tofield has a considerable understanding of cats and their behavior and Cat is charming and clever and funny.  An example:  in a two page spread Simon has carefully constructed an elaborate kitty tree/condo which he presents to Cat.  On the second page Cat has dived into a nearby box of packing peanuts instead and is happily playing in them rather than on the kitty tree.  Gnome makes an appearance as well as a hapless Dog that I think belongs to Simon's Sister.  Don't forget to check out the Simon's Cat website:  [...] where you can see the newest video and enter the photo competition.
0812979656|2.0|I did not enjoy this book. I judge a book, partially, by the distractions of the author's writing style and errors. This book is one distraction after another. I had great difficulty keeping track of the story line. The characters were not admirable or intriguing.
B001F290E4|5.0|This is my first CD by Seal - it is fantastic -  The songs are very familiar from the past but he does an especially nice job with his arrangements.  Surprise for me, I did not have anything by him.  Been sharing it with my friends, plan to load it in my car.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Growing up reading the original DC Superman comics, I did wonder how Superman came to be. Well, now I know. I find (Tom) absolute delight watching him grow, evolve and one day becoming the Super Hero we all know and love.  Mind you, all caracters are fascinating to watch. Lois is spot on, Lana is fabulous and Chloe? Well, she is something else again.  The all cast and crew, wrighters and everybody else involved with the production, well done!!!  Thank you.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|I gave this cd to a friend of mine for a gift & had an opportunity to listen to it.  Elvis always sounds great but on these gospel songs he is magnificent!
B001SAO38Q|5.0|I was a little put off by the price for this Blu-ray disc, however, if you like extras, this disc has them...in HD. The film is pristine and the sound at times is great in Dolby TrueHD. If you own a MINI like I do, you &#34;need&#34; to own this movie!<br /><br />Buy it, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Update: I played this from my Oppo DVD player to my new 65&#34; Samsung SUHD TV. The movie looks like it was made yesterday. Awesome!!!
B002O4JAV0|5.0|I love this album. Words cannot explain how different, how well-made, and how thought-provoking Kid Cudi's album is.  Even if you are not a fan of hip-hop, you will like this album. Seriously, there are only 2 songs that are strictly rapping, the rest are way different from any hip-hop/rap song you have ever heard.   Go get this album. Now.    On a side note, I bought this album from iTunes (because I had a gift card) and I wanted to point out that the price of the version with the bonus tracks was $11.99. Granted, it included 5 interesting videos, but Amazon's price is jaw-dropping.  $5.99 for the whole album! Some serious money-saving right there. Way to go Amazon, you have officially become my favorite online music store.
159448385X|5.0|I started reading this book and it did not grip me.  The chapters were short and self contained.  A few chapters on, I was hooked.  I finished it almost on the same day, from 11AM to 12PM and maybe 1 hour the next morning.  It seemed important to find out what happens.    There are two main female protagonists Mariam and Laila, their lives are brought together by marriage to the same husband.  Also featured are Nana, Mariam's mother, a key player who sets the tone for the whole story.  Everything she says turns out to be true and we sense it, even though Mariam finds it so disagreeable, that Mariam is actually a bastard child and has no place in that society's system of ethics and hierarchy.    Mariam is married off to Rasheed to get rid of her, by her stepmothers and stepfather.  Classic fairy tale material.  She will never find a prince though.    Tariq is Laila's boyfriend, he's a sort of prince though is more a background character.  And there are so many educated folk and sensitive people brought to the fore, against the backdrop of a worsening political situation in the country that is narrated fairly faithfully, true to history.  We get a commentary from the pre Soviet invasion all the way to 9/11 and beyond.    There is a spotlight of the oppression of women under Islam's strict Sharia laws as imposed by the Taliban and lesser fanatics, though a kinder face of that same culture is also brought forth, in the pre Soviet era in particular.    My special highlight was a tour of the Bamiyan Buddha's when Laila is a young child.    We get an insiders look at life in Kabul and what it may be like to wear a burka.  The grim treatment of women and their predicament under sharia is highlighted as they are so powerless against the male dominated justice system.  Sadly, the situation under the Taliban is now been replicated in Pakistan, Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Indonesia - the epidemic of Sharia is spreading.    Mercifully here, there is room for hope at the end, butafter a lot of suffering and unresolved politics.  Hosseini is a brilliant story teller and a credit to his people.  I just hope that women like Mariam get the justice and recompense they deserve.
0451169514|5.0|IT is a  book that I keep coming back to. It has all the elements of a classic good vs evil story and while this kind of thing has been done to death, Stephen King does it in an interesting way. The characters are great and the ending is very satisfying (even though it is in the classic Stephen King style). I truly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a really good story.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off the Wall is the first solo album of adult Michael. I like the rhythm of ROCK WITH YOU, and OFF THE WALL...Awesome.
B00005QGAX|5.0|This album including many songs I like: LIBERIAN GIRL,I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU, SMOOTH CRIMINAL, and have the Spanish version of I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU. Awesome, I'm happy to hear Michael sings in Spanish. R.I.P. Michael, miss you.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|The 4CD+1DVD box set is just beautiful, the booklet is awesome!This is a must have item for a fan. I like the unrelease demo and the concert DVD. Miss you, Michael, I'm waiting for the THIS IS IT movie...
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is the last book of the Twilight Saga by Stephenie Meyer and it is the academy of all the books in this series. Stephenie writes with so much realism until it's down right scary.  All of her books are addictive!  Spell bounding - I read the books Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse in one day.  Once you start reading, you can't stop.  I would wake up in the mornings to a cup of coffee and the next Twilight Saga. Breaking Dawn took me a day and a half to finish.  I did not put this book down.  I took it to the bathtub, forget about eating, I drank lots of coffee and sodas - didn't have time to cook.  I didn't answer the telephone or the door.  I was totally spellbound.  My family should have had me committed to a mentally insane facility.  There was so much action in Breaking Dawn, I became and ally for the Cullen's.  These characters became my family.  Can you believe that, a bunch of vampires - family! Ha...  Edward Cullen and Bella have so much love for each other, it make you wish you had that kind of love.  I was so much into this book; I could see and feel the characters.   I was obsessed with these vampires and werewolves.  This book is Magnificent!
0385504225|3.0|I purchased this book believing it would be as good as Angels & Demons or The DA Vinci Code. I was wrong. For a Harvard Professor with a specialty in Sympolism Robert Langdon is becoming more & more ignorant. He knows symbols yes, but in the book...he comes up with SO many \\"DUHH\\" moments that I was really thrown off. Especially since this book is set in our country's national capitol of Washington, D. C.<br />The characterizations are good, a family's turmoil & the security of our National Heritage are good themes, but there is no real cohesion, many of the chapters are short paragraphs, it reads as if it wasn't edited, there is so much going on that the book runs back & forth between at LEAST 3 different parts of the story, and more at times. There IS tension between the extremely smart adversary & the characters involved, we don't know if the CIA is with us or against us until near the last 1/4 of the book. Forget the D.C. police here, they're not in the same league as the adversary.<br />The end before the very end is a shocker & that saved the read for me. Two endings. Smart.<br />If you like Conspiracy theories, Masonic rituals, symbolism, founding fathers philosophy, knowledge of the ancients..then maybe you'll enjoy this book. I just couldn't wrap my head around how bizarre the whole thing was and I'd really like a picture of how the adversary looked. The description was thorough, but he kept saying he is a work of art, an almost perfect symbol. Maybe the movie will show it....
B00005B364|5.0|Great CD from a great group. I highly recommend it if only to hear \\"Hocus Pocus.\\"
B000002UAX|5.0|Got exactly what I ordered, not only promptly, but faster than it was supposed to be delivered, couldent have asked for more
0312330537|5.0|Reading this book was one of the most incredible literary adventures I've been on. G.D.R. has a remarkable way of telling a story, and I am thankful to the friend who pushed me to read this book. I agree with the other reviewers who said this is the type of book that you wait for, for years. Please read this book. You will be not be disappointed. I have since bought copies for many who are dear to me, who I wanted to share this experience with.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|First, I'm not a BIG fan of terminator, but I have a decent collection of Blu-rays and I can safely say that this one looks way better that the average blu-ray.    There's almost no \\"noise\\" in the video.    The only low point of this movie is that the movie takes forever to start, thanks to he skynet feature and all the menus in between.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|This movie is cute and fun, and I enjoy the new music.  However, if you are a big fan of the TV show, you should just know that the movie lacks some of the clever verbal humor of the show.  The biggest disappointment was how small Jackson's part in the movie is.  But overall, I really liked it.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|another page turner.  but mr brown must have failed his world religions class and appears to have neglected reading the bible in its original languages.  there are many exegetical mistakes in his biblical quotes.  this one should upset those of many faiths... but that is what sells thse things isn't it.
0743497465|1.0|Someone lent me this book, and if not for that reason, I would have closed it after reading the first few pages.  Apart from the ridiculous story line, this book is so poorly written that it ought to be an embarrassment to both its author and publisher, except that it make a few bucks from the author's celebrity.  There are tidbits of new technology sprinkled in it, but to call this \\"thrilling\\" literature is just very wrong. It was boring, boring, boring...and predictable.  And to think I had lent the other person Simon Winchester's \\"The Professor and the Madman\\" and Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\"
B001FB4W0W|5.0|So... I've been reading all the True Blood series for some time now and am anxiously awaiting the newest book. All my friends were talking about how good the HBO series is. I saw it being advertised and thought- oh cool! but since my cable budget doesn't include splurging on HBO, i found a great deal on Amazon and ordered the first season just as season 2 was wrapping up on cable. Problem is, i'm hooked! i missed out on season two so, i've already reserved my copy of the second season on my amazon! before season three, i'll have to find a way to get HBO on my television!   The cable version differs quite a bit from the novels, not nessasarily in a bad way though. For those of you who like Sookie as a sweet modest southern girl, you will be a little surprised by her on-screen personality. And the vampires, Bill Compton and Eric look alot better in my imagination! Not to be mistaken, i can't wait to see what happens next!  If you can find a good deal, and you think you'll watch the DVD's more than once, then it's worth the few bucks to get yourself caught up with the series! hope you enjoy it!
0143038419|5.0|i adore ths book. it has truly changed my perspective and my life as a whole. thank you
B000005RFI|4.0|Paranoid...is one of the first and one of the best Black Sabbath albums created.  It was an original sound then, and still is to this day.  Hard Rock doesn't come like this today.  I enjoyed this cd just as well as the LP when it originally came out...A great piece of music....
B0014I4KH6|5.0|I bought this CD after Kanye West grabbed her mic from her during her VMA acceptance because I wanted to show support for her after he was such a jerk.  I didn't expect that I'd be much into it because country isn't my primary forte (I'm more into Christian rock stuff), I'm old enough to be her dad, and I figured my kids would probably enjoy it.  First of all she has an absolutely great voice.  She is exceptionally gifted, whoever that other reviewer is that said she needs singing lessons knows not of what he speaks.  The lyrics are very much in the vein of teen romance, but there is nothing wrong with that.  To be honest it brought back memories of my high school days.  It's much deeper than I expected coming from someone her age.  Not because it's uncommon to experience hurt, and rejection at that age, but because it's hard to articulate it while keeping your perspective.  Sure there's a few moments where her lyrics seem trite and self serving, but it's far better than most of what I've heard coming from that generation.  All things considered I'd highly recommend this CD.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Mark knopfler's latest, Get Lucky, is fantastic in the spirit of his solo works. Starts off with an Irish riff, then transitions into his unique rock/folk/blues style. His guitar is classic MK: complex, tuneful, and distinctive.   I Got Lucky with Get Lucky! If you love MK you will love this effort!
B001UW58WW|5.0|The man is awesome.  I absolutely love this cd.  I knew nothing about him but after I saw a promo of him on T.V. and having been trained as a classical violinist since grade school and through college, I knew I had to have it and the best way to purchase books and music is on Amazon.  It was delivered when they said it would and it came in mint condition.  Thank you.
B000002MU3|5.0|Monster is considered one of the worst R.E.M. albums. I do not agree with critics. In my opinion, this is one of their best, just after their master \\"Automatic...\\" and \\"Murmur\\"...The sound is apparently \\"grungy\\" but it hides the best inspired pop mood of this fantastic band. Just one song is not good: \\"YOU\\", but the rest should be reminded in all rock anthologies!
B00006B1HH|2.0|I love this movie in general, but it had a scratch in one spot which caused it to skip in one spot. I was very disappointed.
1440469563|4.0|Sense and Sensibility is about a family of women: Mrs. Dashwood, the mother, and Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, the three daughters, who are made to relocate as a result of their father's death. Their home is given to their gullible half-brother who means well and their manipulative sister-in-law who does not mean well at all. Settling in a cottage given to them by a generous distant relative in Devonshire, the girls experience romance and heartbreak.<br />  I've heard of Jane Austen's work before, and I read this as a prelude before I read Pride and Prejudice. I have to say, even though it was engaging towards the end, in the beginning I had trouble plowing through the introduction. There was nothing there to grasp my interest, only long, insipid descriptions of the surrounding countryside, and a long build-up to the main plot. About halfway through, when Marianne begins her romance with Willoughby, I actually found myself wanting to read the book and thinking with excitement and a feeling of suspense about what would happen next.<br />  The characters weren't perfect, with both flaws and redeeming qualities, such as Elinor, who is very intellectual and polite, but may be missing out on life because she's very reserved, and Marianne, who likes to live life to the fullest emotionally, but is completely devastated when bad things happen to her.<br />  I liked that it gave me a feel of what life was like for people in the moderate and upper end class in the early 1800's, as I'm used to stories such as Oliver Twist, where the main subject is life in the low slums, so it was nice to see the other end for a change. In regard to the storyline, it was very interesting in the latter part of the book, when its it is full of romantic betrayal and unseen engagements, and people turning up unexpectedly.<br /> This was a good introduction to Jane Austen's books, but based upon to the admiration she has received, I don't believe this is her best, and I'm ready to see what she can do in Pride and Prejudice.

0385504225|2.0|I've read most of Dan Brown's novels but I don't consider myself a big fan.  He is a pretty good story-teller though his novels are a bit contrived.  This was his worst effort by far in my opinion.    I figured out the secret location everyone was frantically searching for pretty much at the beginning of the book, the first time the phrase \\"a staircase under a rock\\" was mentioned.  Then I had to read hundreds more pages before I could say, \\"See, I told you so\\".  The great secret that could rock the order of the world, and the masons vehemently protected, willing even to die or sacrifice their brothers was more than a let down:  it was a rip-off.  Dan Brown insults every reader's intelligence by not delivering after such a huge buildup.    Ernest Hemingway once used bullfighting as a metaphor for writing.  He noted that some matadors dramatically roll their capes, accentuating their movements, though never getting close to the bull.  The good matadors don't need to exaggerate their movements.  In this novel, Dan Brown is waving his cape all over the place though no bull is ever dangerously close to him (unless we count B.S.).  The characters in this book constantly have their jaws drop open in utter amazement over the most banal revelations. There are \\"unbelievable secrets\\" that hardly raise the reader's eyebrow, and historical and religious references that just prove annoying after a little while.  To worsen matters, the writing becomes tiresome at times.  I don't know how many times Brown uses the adjective, \\"expansive\\".  There are expansive lawns, expansive roofs, expansive parking lots.....PICK ANOTHER DAMN ADJECTIVE ALREADY!    The worst part is the incredible enthusiasm with which Brown embraces all kinds of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, from astral projection to remote viewing; from near-death experiences to weighing a person's soul at the moment of death.  It's as if he read the book, \\"The Secret\\" and actually believes that crap.  Which makes me wonder, is Dan Brown related to Sylvia Brown?
B002C6K7N0|4.0|If anyone could do it, I had a feeling Andy Sneap could. With his molten metal roots and incredible production we get a COMPLETE return to form. Finally! Though the last couple discs showed signs, they never quite did it. This one goes over the top.<br /><br />Crisp sounding and well executed, Megadeth have found the sound that got them there. Well at least Mustaine did, as there were so many incarnations of Megadeth its hard to keep track. The only thing missing on this release and Megadeths revival is Dave Ellefson. I bet he is really kicking himself after this one.<br /><br />Just think 'Killing is my Business' guitar riffs like on '1320', solo's completely reminiscent of 'Rust in Peace' throughout, along with Political Lyrics like the latest albums and some catchy riffs that are reminiscent of 'Peace Sells' as the base of most songs.. I mean you get it ALL here. Its like a 'best of' collection, yet 100% new. Metallica's 'Death Magnetic' is nothing like this. Mustaine actually found God and the music got heavier! Unheard of..<br /><br />Most of all, this disc is a guitar shredders orgasm. Just solo after solo of intense shredding. And to think Mustaine was injured and going to throw in the towel a bunch of years back. Unbelievable playing and interaction between Mustaine and Broderick on this CD. If you liked the solo's on 'Hanger 18' than strap yourself in and enjoy. Its relentless!<br /><br />There are a couple tracks that are slightly above average, thats why it gets a 4. 'The Hardest Part...'is a bit bland and is the 'ballad' of the disc.'Bodies' is standard, but not BAD, just average. The other 10 tracks, well, just kill. Especially '1320' which sound like it could have been on 'Killing is my Business' with its 'Rattlehead' style guitar riffing. There is no score between 4 and 5, but it is a high 4!<br /><br />I will say it again, Andy Sneap brought Mustaine back full circle. This is without a doubt, one of the highlights of 2009. And the disc Mustaine has been needing to put out for some time. This is for real. This has legs!<br /><br />I see by all the reviews, I am not the only one to see the magic in this. You will too if you just get it!his is for real. This has legs!    I see by all the reviews, I am not the only one to see the magic in this. You will too if you just get it!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was not sure what to think of this collection at first, about the idea of taking existing music that is very good on its own merits and creating new sounds with it.  At first listen, I was somewhat impressed with what Sir George and Giles Martin did with the sounds, but I wasn't sold on the concept, and least not yet.  What did strike me immediately was the clarity and fullness of the music; it sounded as if the songs and other sounds were recorded several years ago vs. several decades ago.  And with each listen, what also became very apparent was the time and care taken in creating a decent finished product.    One of the most interesting concepts of this project is that the Martin's, father and son, have been able to recreate what some of the Beatles music may have been able to sound like if the technology of today existed back then.  Because most of the tracks had to be mixed down in order to accommodate a four or eight track machine, they were able to remix in a way that gives a more natural stereo picture.  This makes the sounds fuller rather than hearing vocals and an instrument on one channel, other instruments on the other channel.  It also gives the opportunity to recreate each part of the mix from the original source before any mixing down has occurred to a second and third generation master, which reduces the musical integrity.      What's exciting is that we get to hear the potential of having all of their music catalog eventually approached this way so we can hear and enjoy the music in its fullest clarity.  Purists will not like this idea, but being the current stereo mixes are limited in their sound picture scope, a modern-day stereo mix would only improve the finished product significantly.  Besides, the purists already have both the original stereo and mono mixes available from the newly released 2009 remastered series anyway.    This disk is experimental in nature but offers something new and exciting that really hasn't been done before, at leastnot with any previous Beatles works.  What makes this effort even more special is that Sir George himself had the executive hand over creation of this project and no better person could have done this, being he was the producer for all of these tracks in their original form.  Both Giles and George give a new approach to already familiar music and treat it with the absolute best sonic quality it could be given.  They truly created a very solid finished product with this, rather than just release alternative or obscure songs from the group's catalog, heard especially on the Anthology series CDs.    Some of the song highlights I found to be interesting are as follows:  - a reverse `fade-in' of the piano from `A Day in the Life' after `Because', launching into the `Get Back / The End' sequence  - `Paul's \\"Ah, (look at all the lonely people)\\" chorus of `Eleanor Rigby' weaving in and out of the background between tracks, in a very distant echo  - the different stages of `Strawberry Fields Forever' blended seamlessly together (a nice tribute to John), and tacking on various other song clips at the end including `Penny Lane', `Piggies, and `Hello Goodbye'  - an awesome intro of `Tomorrow Never Knows' becoming the backdrop of `Within You Without You'  - `Good Night' being slowed down to the key of E and becoming the backdrop for the beginning of `Octopus's Garden' (a really nice tribute to Ringo)  - `Why Don't We Do It In the Road' becoming the backdrop for `Lady Madonna'  - `Within You Without You' becoming the backdrop of `Here Comes the Sun' in the beginning, and ending with `The Inner Light' (a really nice tribute to George)  - the acoustic, quieter version of `While My Guitar Gently Weeps', with a brand new score from Sir George beautifully augmenting the background (another really nice tribute to George)  - the `Hey Jude' chorus portion bringing the bass guitar riff at the tail end of the popular version to the foreground, fading into `Sgt. Pepper's (reprise)' (a nicetribute to Paul)  - and lastly, `All You Need is Love' fading into `Good Night' with some charming spoken passages from each of the Beatles (probably from a Christmas message they made to their fans)      If you keep an open mind and treat this not as a `greatest hits', but as a completely new and fresh approach to the legend of the Beatles, you will be greatly satisfied because, with extremely little exception, it is so well done and should please many generations of fans, old and new.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|This is the first album I've heard from the band Muse and I have to say I am quite impressed with it. I'm an old timer and I have heard other hard rock bands in the past making a foray into the classical music realm by incorporating an orchestra into their songs. An example of this are the bands Deep Purple, Queen, and The Rolling Stones.<br />What I like about this album, The Resistance, is the seamless mixing between the hard rock parts and the orchestral parts. The vocals are a perfect accompaniment to the music.<br />I will definitely look for the other albums from this band.
0385504225|5.0|Fantastic read !!!  Compelling, suspensful and mind opening....Dan Brown has really done a great job with pulling the reader in and making them beg for more.  When i finished this book i took a moment to ponder the ideas he wrote about.  Although a fictional book, the new ways of looking at the world, education, religion and ones self truly captivated me.
B0021L8US0|5.0|I finally seen this a week ago. I am glad I caught it before it left the theater. I cannot believe it cost only 30 Million to create. It sucks you in from start to finish. It seemed like it was over before it started. I can only hope for a sequel in 3 years. Why in 3 years? Watch it and find out why!<br />The aliens speak their own language, not English. This is a major plus! It seems fake that an alien race would speak English, but how many times has it happened in movie land? Also, the alien effects are the best I have EVER seen. They look amazingly real and move with a unique body language.<br />The alien weapons are bad, bad, bad ass!<br />The main character is played by a virtual unknown, at least here in the USA. No one could have done a better job with the role. He carries most of the film on his back and he delivers!<br />Some reviews complain that there are scenes of graphic violence and language, but there is nothing worse here than anything you have seen before. The action/fighting scenes are \\"graphic\\", but real-life war is bloody. That's what happens when weapons are involved in fighting. It is R rated also.<br />Peter Jackson endorsed something that blows away all 3 of his LOTR movies! If you have not seen this, and are a fan of Sci-Fi/Alien movies, this is a must see. The best film I've seen this year, bar none!
1853260320|4.0|Mansfield Park has been called Jane Austen's most controversial novel. Modern readers may wonder what in the world could possibly be controversial about what some people call Austen's most boring novel. The Bertram's family slavery based fortune caused a bit of a sensation when the novel was first published. Other than the reference to slavery, Mansfield Park is most Austen readers least favorite novel due to the timid disposition of the book's main protagonist, Fanny Price.<br /><br />When Fanny was only ten years old, her aunt, Lady Bertram, decided to help her destitute sister who had the misfortune to fall in love with a lowly sailor with no fortune, by taking in one of her many children. The idea of removing Fanny from Portsmouth to Mansfield came not from Lady Bertram, but from her meddlesome sister, Mrs Norris, who is probably the most annoying character in this book. Fanny is brought to Mansfield under the suggestion of Mrs Norris, who believed removing the child from the oppressive conditions of her family, would bring her advantages her family could never possibly provide. Mrs Norris, however, takes every opportunity to humiliate Fanny. Her presence becomes a constant reminder to Fanny that she is not an equal to her spoiled cousins, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />The only person Fanny develops a deep bond with at Mansfield is with her cousin Edmund. As a child, he consoles her when she is removed from the only home she has ever known, but as they grow into adults, Fanny falls in love with him.<br /><br />Fanny's love for Edmund is dashed with the entrance of Miss Mary Crawford and Mr Henry Crawford. Mary and Henry are the half brother and sister of Mrs Grant, the wife of Mansfield's parson. Maria and Julia are in awe of Mr Crawford good looks and manners. Edmund, however, begins to fall in love with Mary.<br /><br />I did not find this novel as boring as some people, but it did seem that Fanny was hardly noticed by any characters until the middle of the novel. She is just lurking in the background watching her cousins making questionable decisions. Out of all the Mansfield household, Fanny is the only one not completely enraptured by the Crawfords. She realizes Henry's intentions with her cousins are not good, and she knows that Mary is not the person Edmund believes she is.<br /><br />Besides, Mrs Norris, who I found absolutely annoying, Edmund was also not my favorite character. He knows Mary's values are entirely different than his own, yet he persists in hoping Mary will someday accept him. Mary ridicules Edmund's decision to become a clergyman, yet he still hopes they will someday have a future together. Why? I enjoyed the novel, but I did not enjoy the romance between Fanny and Edmund. The ending made it seem like Edmund picked Fanny because he couldn't have who he really wanted the entire novel. Fanny's dream only came true when Mary made it impossible and I do mean impossible for Edmund to make excuses for her.  Only in the end did Edmund Bertram realize that the woman he has been seeking all his life has been right under his nose.

B002AOWXO0|4.0|Okay, so I too was a tad nervous when I first downloaded the single `Relator'.  I mean, I'll say this, just listening to Scarlett talk you know that she can sing.  She has the most seductive jazz singer smoky tone to her voice, a tone that is both soothing and sharp at the same time.  I remember hearing her rendition of `Summertime' and just being speechless at the richness and depth in her soulful voice.<br /><br />Then she covered Tom Waits.<br /><br />Now, she had her moments, but to say that her album `Anywhere I Lay My Head' was mediocre is kind of putting it nicely.  It's a commendable thing to put yourself out there for something you truly love and admire, but some things should never be attempted.  On `Break Up' she joins forces with Pete Yorn to create a completely different album, something much better suited for her voice and her talent.<br /><br />Thankfully she showcases the potential I knew she had.<br /><br />Sadly she doesn't get to showcase it enough.<br /><br />That is my one complaint with `Break Up'.  Now, I have never listened to Pete Yorn's music before this album, which is rather shocking since I am a huge fan of the genre and the artists who he reminds me of.  He has a great sound and an interesting voice (I'm a huge fan of the blemishes or weakness within a singers vocals because they expose a raw emotional connection, but Yorn's vocals at times have too many faults) but the real star of this album is Scarlett, and he just doesn't give her enough room to really shine.  She is only really featured prominently on a handful of songs, delegated to back up vocals on the majority, which is sad because the songs for which she is key are the songs that really stand out on this album.<br /><br />`Relator', the album's first single is simply flawless.  It may very well be my favorite song so far this year.  It has the right bounce, the right amount of spunk and catchy deliciousness.  I can't help but snap my fingers and bop my head and totally get into this song.  I think it's time for a new ringtone!  A completely different sound comes from `Clean', but Scarlett sounds impeccable here as well, her soft vocals meshing perfectly with Yorn's delicate delivery.  I just wish that Yorn would have realized the brilliance of their duets, for the compliment one another flawlessly.  `I Am The Cosmos' is an intriguing track, a cover of the song by Chris Bell, and it works quite well in all its oddness.  The track also focuses on Scarlett, which is a plus.<br /><br />`I Don't Know What To Do' is charming, sweet, delightful goodness that just soars and makes me feel all warm inside.  I just wanted to say that.<br /><br />I really liked `Shampoo'.  Scarlett only has backup vocals here, but she harmonizes beautifully with Yorn (less a harmony and more a vocal compliment).  The song has a really nice flow to it, an effortless stride from start to finish.<br /><br />I also liked `Someday' a lot, very raw and intense, but this is also a track that exposes Yorn's weaknesses as a vocalist.  He has almost a Johnny Cash feel to his singing here, and that lump in his throat is overdone a tad over time (it's also the longest track on the album).  Like I mentioned; I am all for the vocal blemishes.  Damien Rice is my favorite musicial/singer out there and he has far from a perfect voice, but his blemishes are not as prominent as Yorn's so they actually compliment, not hinder, his music.  Yorn is not a bad singer, but he needs someone like Scarlett to even him out, which is why he really should have shared the spotlight equally with her, for she helps mask some of his more noticeable imperfections.<br /><br />`Blackie's Dead' makes up for the odd \\"Blackie's dead\\" with a funky beat and fun playful vocals.  I just don't like the way they say that, \\"Blackie's dead\\", but whatever, it's a very small part of the song so I'm over it.  `Wear and Tear' is a good track, even if Yorn sounds kind of strange in parts.  If Scarlett had been given something to sing outside of barely audible background vocals and a thankless bridge it could have been much better.<br /><br />`Search Your Heart' saddens me.  I just hate that `high school prom band' way in which they say \\"let me search your heart\\".  It ruins the WHOLE song for me.  The rest of the song is actually pretty good, and I love some of the guitar work here.  I just cannot stand that \\"let me search your heart\\" part; it tarnishes the whole song, which could have been one of the top 3 tracks on the album.  Instead it rests closer to 6.<br /><br />So, in the end, I recommend the album.  I'd probably rank the album like this:<br /><br />1) Relator<br />2) Clean<br />3) I Don't Know What To Do<br />4) Blackie's Dead<br />5) Shampoo<br />6) Search Your Heart<br />7) Someday<br />8) I Am The Cosmos<br />9) Wear and Tear<br /><br />If you are a fan of indie rock then you really need to check this out.  I'm going to look into Yorn's music a little deeper now, since I am none to familiar with him at this point.  I can see great things in the future for this couple if they continue their working relationship.  If not, I certainly hope that Scarlett uses this as a stepping stone to further her singing career in the right direction.  She has the goods to really make an impact in the music world.  I, for one, am rooting for her.ss bridge it could have been much better.      `Search Your Heart' saddens me.

0143038583|4.0|Easily more detailed and descriptive, this book covers much of what \\"In Defense of Food\\" covered and more.  This book feels less like a crusade against the food industry and more like a discovery into how food gets to our table.  He includes some fun stories about how he goes and actually gets involved with the farming, butchering, and hunting of food.  It is truly eye-opening to get a little glimpse into what happens before the shrink wrapping.  Hopefully I can pass to my children what food really is.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is the single most impressive remastered collection EVER. From sound quality to presentation to arguably the greatest body of music produced by a single band in popular history, I can't imagine anything surpassing this any time soon.    The packaging is gorgeous. The piano-black magnetic flip-top box opens to reveal the lovingly detailed albums. Yes, these are the first CDs to give you that feeling of having an \\"album.\\" The gatefold holds the CD on the right, and has a pocket for the liner notes on the left. The individual liner notes include the original notes (the guy who wrote that kids in \\"AD 2000\\" will still love The Beatles nailed it on the head, no?), new historical notes placing the music in context to their history, and then recording notes which detail intricacies and interesting factoids about the actual recording of the album itself. I loved just holding these records...small yes, but as close to a mini-LP as I've experienced in a while.    The remastering is astonishing. Nothing short of miraculous. When was the last time listening to music gave you goosebumps? It will happen here, and often. I am as familiar with these 525 minutes of music as I am with my own heartbeat, and yet I was continually amazed at the sonics, the details. Instruments I've never noticed. Imperfections that make the performances absolutely \\"real.\\" I did not think I could appreciate Beatle music any more than I already do, yet I feel like I'm starting over.    I fell in love with this music all over again.    Each album delivers its' treasures in their own way. The early ones...say, the first four...for the most part have that early stereo effect. Instruments on the left, vocals on the right (the recordings were done on two-track machines). As I understand it, no individual vocal or instrument has been enhanced in a remix. The tracks have been cleaned up, but the balance has been preserved. You won't get blasting drum beats or startlingly loud vocals. One more thing: you probably already know these are the original \\"British\\" releases...if you're looking for \\"The Early Beatles\\" or \\"Meet The Beatles\\" or \\"Something New\\"...well, you need to brush up on your Beatle history.    Their first LP, \\"Please Please Me\\", was famously recorded in one day. The opening, \\"One, two, three, FOH!\\" launching into \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" has a crispness that immediately lets you know you are entering uncharted waters. This song has never sounded this good. The album breezes by...you'll marvel at the purity and clarity of these young voices...the gorgeous harmonies...each instrument clearly in its' place. We all know how Lennon was shredding his vocal cords by the time they got to \\"Twist and Shout\\", and you'll swear you can hear them fray right here.    \\"With The Beatles\\" open with a thrilling \\"It Won't Be Long\\", a song I could not have cared less about before. I felt that way about a lot of songs going through these records. \\"The Night Before\\", \\"You Won't See Me\\"...previously \\"neglected\\" songs regained a new life for me. On THIS album though, you get rockers, Broadway (Til There Was You), Motown covers...and again, it all sounds totally new. The guitars in particular...I think I can hear each individual string strummed.    \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" opens with that chord...MAN did they know how to get your attention when people used to put needles into grooves! When Lennon's voice breaks in \\"If I Fell\\", it somehow brought him vividly back to life. The feeling was powerful, and a little weird, I admit. My eyes kinda welled up with tears, and that was only the first time. Again, these astonishing multi-part harmonies just soar...and freakin' Ringo Starr rocks like all get out. If anybody's \\"status\\" rises because of this set, it'll be him.    \\"For Sale\\" is, for me, an odd mish-mash. There are songs from their pre-Beatles live marathons (like Kansas City), country-ish sojourns (Honey Don't), a Buddy Holly cover (Words of Love), blistering rockers (Rock and Roll Music), sweet ballads (I'll Follow The Sun...oh my God what vocals...)...but in the context of the first three records, here you see the guys going for something \\"more\\". This is the album that transitions into the creative leap that was to follow with the next three records. Here you'll also start to notice the creativity in McCartney's bass playing. He's just not keeping the beat.    \\"Help!\\" again opens with a heart-stopping chorus. A playlist of only first songs on Beatle records would be quite impressive, and not for those with medical problems. This album shows a consistency that is leaps and bounds above the last one. The Dylan influence (You've Got To Hide Your Love Away) isn't as \\"in your face\\" as some people have suggested. It just seems that these guys can do no wrong. Each song is filled with special moments...a little something you'll return to later. A harmony here, a drum lick there, a delicate Harrison guitar flourish...and then there's \\"Yesterday.\\" Paul is right there in your car/headphones/living room, and when the strings come in, you'll wish they didn't.    \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" make the greatest double-LP that was never a double LP. These are two parts of a whole, I think, and there are things in these songs that will keep you interested forever. The bouncing piano of \\"You Won't See Me\\" with those classic pop back-up vocals. The dreamy guitars of \\"Norwegian Wood.\\" The elegant simplicity of \\"For No One\\" and \\"In My Life\\" with that classical harpsichord bridge. The sweetness in \\"Michelle\\", \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" and \\"Girl.\\" The Beatle-bob, head-shaking guitar power chords in \\"I'm Looking Through You.\\" The startled opening of \\"Taxman.\\" The what-the-hell \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" stuff. The drama of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Nowhere Man.\\" These are routinely considered amongst the best albums ever made. It's impossible to argue.    Now we come to \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\". Quite possibly the most fun \\"best album of all time\\" to listen to. While there are loads of arguments as to which album is the best rock album ever (I'm kinda partial to \\"Born To Run\\"), are there any that changed what we consider pop music in one fell swoop? Yes, its' luster has been lost over time, but this sonic upgrade guarantees its' place in history. C'mon, \\"Sgt Pepper's\\" into \\"With A Little Help...\\" into \\"Lucy In the Sky...\\" is never forgotten once heard. The first time anyone heard that, they knew it was something special. Something amazing. That just doesn't happen that often. For those technologically oriented, the fact that this was recorded on a four-track recorder is impossible. Consider \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\" alone. One thing that stuck out: check out the horns on \\"Good Morning, Good Morning.\\" They come driving out of your speakers like an out-of-control semi.    The Beatles start to get loopy with \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" For the first time, there are things that seem like a waste of time. But the number of stone-cold classics makes you ignore stuff like \\"Flying.\\" Again with the brisk intro of the title track...the guys let you know immediately you're in for a trip, and they remind you that they can rock with the best of 'em. These new remasters reveal details in \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Field Forever\\" heretofore unheard. You can hear the sun shining in \\"Penny Lane.\\" How is that possible? And it's \\"cranberry sauce.\\"    I'm not as impressed with \\"The White Album\\" as I think most people are. Yes, it's still one of the great ones, but for the first time, I became impatient with the Beatles. That's a quibble, as the thrills of \\"Back In The USSR, the early metal of \\"Helter Skelter\\", the delicacies of \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Julia\\" and \\"Martha Dear\\", the singalong \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", the epics \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\"...FAR outweigh the tedium of \\"Wild  Honey Pie\\" and \\"Revolution #9\\", the boring \\"Long Long Long\\", the novelty-ish \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\" The improvement in the sonics exaggerates these differences. Still, a most impressive collection...just not up to the last few.    \\"Yellow Submarine\\"? All together now. It's an aberration.    \\"Let It Be\\" again mixes a rare mis-step with some legendary tunes. This gives you a chance to re-evaluate Phil Spector's take on the Fab Four. You'll be thinking \\"If only...\\" a few times. Like if only he didn't syrup over \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" but I guess for that, you have \\"Let It Be...Naked.\\" The poignancy of \\"The Two Of Us\\" will touch you. And yes, they passed their audition.    I have always considered \\"Abbey Road\\" to be their real last album. If you don't know, it was recorded after \\"Let It Be\\", but released first. This is another record on the short list of \\"best ever by anyone\\" and similarly, it's hard to argue. Harrison's contribution rival (surpass?) Lennon/McCartney's, and the side-long suite condenses the random joys of  a 'Sgt. Pepper's'-like variety into half the time. Seriously, the last song is titled \\"The End\\"...isn't that how it should be? I say yes.    \\"Past Masters\\" blows my mind. This collection that organizes the Beatles non-LP singles contains some of the single greatest singles ever. Ever. EVER. \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", \\"I Feel Fine\\" (Niiiiiiice feedback!), \\"Day Tripper\\" (whip-cracking drums), \\"We Can Work It Out\\", \\"Lady Madonna\\"...  I want to \\"single\\" out two performances. First, \\"Paperback Writer\\". I previously enjoyed this tune, but now it vaults into one of my favorite Beatle songs. I had never appreciated the intertwined harmonies as much, nor the muscular rhythm section and snarling guitars. Of all the songs in the box, this is one that feels the most \\"different.\\" Maybe it's just me.  And then there's \\"Hey Jude.\\" I doesn't get any better than this. Paul and a piano, the rest of the lads folding in, and then the soaring ending. If you liked the song before, you'll love it now. if you loved it before, you'll weep.    A DVD collects the \\"mini-documentaries\\". These tasty little treats (each one available individually on its' respective album) are 3-4 minute long visual liner notes, if you will. They are tantalizingly brief, with some terrific photos/videos, \\"backstage\\" chatter, and salient comments from all involved. There's some stuff that you'll recall from the \\"Anthology\\" films, but there's also a whole lot of new stuff, and that stuff is pretty sweet. I thought it was pretty cool that if you watch them in order...\\"play all\\"...they placed Abbey Road last. Nice touch for diehards.    There. I'm done. There is no possible way that if you've read this far, you could in any way be disappointed with this box. The Beatles will change your musical life. Again.

0385504225|1.0|I finished The Lost Symbol last night, and it exceeded my expectations for mediocrity. It's pretty hard to discuss a book that depends entirely on tricks to keep you reading and not end up with spoilers, but here goes. First, to borrow a silly comparison from one of the book's characters, what if the big secret the whole book is about were the recipe for Coca Cola? Before you buy, think about it.<br /><br />Imagine that the most powerful Mason in the world, a man of unimaginable wealth, intelligence, and goodness, offers his irresponsible druggie son, as an 18th birthday present, a choice between his own unimaginable wealth and the most precious secret item in the entire legendary Masonic utility shed. Yeah, that is the inconceivable event that sets things in motion. Now imagine that the son, having chosen unimaginable wealth instead (what a surprise!), ends up in a Turkish prison for drug offenses, and DOES NOT think of using some of his unimaginable wealth (rather than Dad's) to bribe his way out. Still with me?<br /><br />Now imagine that the nastiest steroid-mangled psycho on the planet manages to scam his way through all 33 initiation rituals of Masonry (that's a few years of close scrutiny by some pretty picky folks) without ANYONE noticing that there's something, well, a little \\"off\\" about him (such as, a wig, full body makeup to cover tattoos worthy of Queequeg, a nasty --self-inflicted-- scar below his Richard, and a tendency to get all wookie-eyed and babble about ascending to the plenastral neovoid). No problemo? Ok, imagine that in spite of living through a bout with the Illuminati and a firsthand encounter with the Priory of Sion, symbol specialist Robert Langdon is \\"sceptical\\" about secret societies. I mean, I'm sceptical, but I haven't played footsie with the Sang Real or been hunted by Illuminati assassins....<br /><br />If you are still saying, \\"Let me at it!\\" I'll just offer one last bit of advice: The end of this book is the most appalling letdown, not just in terms of the suspense, but in terms of the integrity of the world of the novel, that I truly cannot imagine worse. The recipe for Coca Cola would have been an improvement. Instead we get a shovelful of BS that is, among other things, endlessly uplifting.<br /><br />The da Vinci Code was fun, like a bag of flavored potato chips or your own pint of cheap chocolate ice cream. The Lost Symbol is not fun. The characters are not just cardboard, they are outside the realm of possibility. The puzzles require reams of exposition, which means people run from SWAT teams while panting to each other, \\"Did you notice that there are 217 steps on this staircase?\\" To which their companion replies, \\"Yes, but you missed the REALLY important thing about the steps! Look!!!\\" [End of chapter; switch venues for a chapter]<br /><br />Contrary to the exasperated claims of some who didn't finish it but thought they knew where it was going, the book is absolutely not anti-Mason; nor is it anti-Christian. In fact, it's not really anti- much of anything. CIA? O-o-o-o-ok! Psychotic tattooed killer? Hey, once you get to know him.... One mildly amusing thing: The Mormons -- who do not take kindly to this sort of stuff -- do not figure at all in the book. They are only mentioned once, in a list. Pretty amusing, when you consider that one of the key sentences in the book was the enigmatic last words of one Jos. Smith.<br /><br />Trust us: This book reads like a really bad parody of a Dan Brown novel.

B00006ZXSK|4.0|Cinderella stands squarely among the most re-told stories. Dozens of variations exist, but nearly all stay close to the basics: poor but hardworking girl, cruel step-family, and a magical boost into the prince's affections. This time, however, we skip the magic and see a lot of hard work on Cinderella's part, plus a little righteous collusion by the housekeepers still loyal to her and her late father. I like that - instead of magic, we see intelligence and determination; instead of a magical fairy godmother, we're treated to larcenous devotion by the staff that she has treated honorably. The conclusion means that much more when it comes from personal strength (and a strong throwing arm) rather than an effortless wave of a wand.<br /><br />Huston does her usual spectacular job as wicked stepmother, and Megan Dodds does beautifully as the stepsister you love to hate. Barrymore really makes this movie, though, with just the right [[ASIN:B000056PMV Charlie's Angel]] edge to the dutiful daughter. Not every movie can be one for the ages, though. Still, this one pulls well away from the pack through careful choice of which conventions need to be followed, and which need thorough flouting.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0385493622|5.0|The book is about the history of one of the most outstanding problems in the history of mathematics namely; Fermat's last theorem. Fermat's famous theorem can be understood by middle school pupils but it's proof has persistently eluded history's most powerful minds for over 350 years. Singh's master piece follows Fermat's theorem from its very roots some 2000 years before the birth of Fermat to its final proof by Andrew Wills in 1993. Singh literally transport's the reader from ancient Greece, to third century Alexandria, to seventeenth century France, to second world war Europe, to the boots of Andrew Wills in pursuit of this unique theorem. Three centuries of rich history are beautifully woven into a thrilling tale. The book covers a wide assortment of very interesting topics including; Pythagoras and his secret society, Euclid and his elements, Fermat and his legacy, Euler and his attempts, women in mathematics, Hilbert and his problems, Turing and his machines, Wills and his determined struggle and much more all in clear and vivid narration readily accessible to the general reader. The book establishes a tender balance between daunting detail and frustrating superficialism; an impressive task considering the highly complicated mathematics included. The author gives readers a new perspective to the world of mathematics. All said, this is one of the best popular science books I ever read. It gripped my attention from the moment I flipped its front cover to the moment I put it down a couple of days later. Simply magnificent!

Both the movie and book are very good.<br /><br />I am the father of 4 teenager-young adults; there is something about Christopher McCandless story that reaches to them.<br /><br />He surely was an intelligent and charismatic young adult, who touched several people he met on his way to Alaska.<br />On his pursue to find the meaning of life, dropping out of society, seeking an utopic idealism, he found death. With his experience, he helps teen agers and young adults to understand even though our society and life is not perfect, you have to be very careful trying to find an answer, to the meaning of life, by renouncing what is and has been established as our way of life by our society.<br /><br />He renounced to all, probably to a possibility of a great life, he pretended to find happiness alone,  when he realized the mistakes he committed and wanted to come back, it was to late for him. Good lesson to all teenagers who might feel the same way he did.

B00005NTJM|3.0|My musical home base was 1982 so it took me awhile as I was exploring the pop and rock of my time to trace back through recent musical history and find the first efforts of those bands that I have come to appreciate.  Here is my take on Jethro Tull's first album \\"This Was\\":<br /><br />My Sunday Feeling - Upbeat, aggressive blues song, typical of album openner's in general.  I enjoy the complex drums and the flute on this song about waking after a night of drinking/partying although that is not my personal thing.<br /><br />Some Day The Sun Won't Shine For You - Laid back, humorous blues song.  I'm not a big fan of blues per se so Jethro Tull is bringing me out beyond my usual musical territory here.  The subjects (or should I say suspects?) of blues songs seem to be in trouble with someone or other most of the time.<br /><br />Beggar's Farm - Slightly sinister guitar highlights this songs tale of criticism and libidinous fetters.  There is a great jam at the end with Ian Anderson's aggressive flute playing wrapping up this more interesting song.<br /><br />Move On Alone - Sad song with horns that, for me, add a bit of \\"oh woe is me\\" sarcasm to the mood of this blues song.<br /><br />Serenade To A Cuckoo - Instrumental with jazzy flute lead.  Ian Anderson moans and blows on his flute; very hip, very cool man, dig it! or whatever it is that jazz fans say when they like their jazz.  Personally I'm not so much into the jazz sound.<br /><br />Dharma For One - Another instrumental this time with a more aggressive flute melody that switches tone for contrast.  This song is more of a rock jam as opposed to the jazzy \\"Serenade to a Cuckoo\\".  While the musicianship is great throughout the album I especially appreciate the drumming on this song; the solo gives one the impression that Clive Barker, the drummer, is working some great mechanical monster.  Great stuff!<br /><br />It's Breaking Me Up - This song has that classic blues sound with its loping gate and sassy harmonica.  The lyrics disturb me a bit because the refrain turns the metaphor around in a way that makes me wonder whether the singer isn't having violent thoughts in response to how the \\"woman\\" has treated him.<br /><br />Cat's Squirrel - Rock jam instrumental.<br /><br />A Song For Jeffrey - Song starts off with the flute and a sense of anticipation that is nicely answered with a kick butt harmonica and guitar line.  Moving through its variations this song reflects what I find I like most in forthcoming work by Jethro Tull. Not sure what the singer is saying or what the lyrics are about but I like it!  Probably an essential song for Tull fans.<br /><br />Round - Another instrumental bringing in a quiet close to the album proper.<br /><br />One for John Gee - Is this some form of swing?  This instrumental has an interesting bass and drum solo.<br /><br />Love Story - This song has interesting melodic shifts that keeps the forward leaning rhythm moving, leaning back, then moving forward again.  The lyrics reflect a more hopeful, less blues oriented outlook; more like rock and roll with the folksy drum (not sure what its called) for a lighter whimsical contrast.  A sign of the wonderful instrumentation in Tull songs to come.<br /><br />Christmas Song - Warning, do not play at Christmas until you have listend to this first! Scathing critique of the average Xmas reveller.  Here are some of the lyrics:<br /><br />So how can you laugh when your own mothers hungry,<br />And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?<br />And if I just messed up your thoughtless pleasures,<br />Remember, if you wish, this is just a christmas song.<br /><br />That should go well with egg nog!  Nice building guitar/banjo with strings coming in gives the music a sense of Christmas cheer, nonetheless.<br /><br />(3 stars)  Given that I am not a big fan of the blues or jazz, this album may hold less interest for me than for others.  Still I think this album has a bit more merit to it thancompletion of a Tull fan's collection.  For progressive rock fans I recommend \\"Beggar's Farm\\", \\"Dharma for One\\", \\"Song for Jeffrey\\", \\"Love Story\\" and \\"Christmas Song\\".  These songs most anticipate the later Jethro Tull sound and avoid the more bluesy and jazzy songs.  Add \\"My Sunday Feeling\\" as a good rock song.  If your tastes are more open than mine then I think you will enjoy this album as a whole.frey\\", \\"Love Story\\" and \\"Christmas Song\\".

B001UREJWM|5.0|This is an excellent recording that is true to everything Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio have represented musically since their origins. These guys are masters of their craft, at the top of their game, and seem to be growing stronger with time.  I hope this is only the first of a whole slew of Heaven & Hell albums!       The Devil You Know is a work of extraordinary sonic texture and complexity and coherent themes that showcase the band's graceful exercise of talent, technique, powerful musicianship and compelling songwriting.  It takes several listens all the way through to really appreciate how good it is.  The songs are not cluttered though.  In fact, the riffs and melody lines are straightforward and catchy.  You will want to hear them over and over again.      The sheer power of this album is twofold, as becomes apparent the more you listen to it and really get to know the songs.  Musically, I'm convinced it's the heaviest, darkest, most foreboding in the Sabbath-Dio catalog.  Not in the way of contemporary thrash or doom metal, but in a measured, controlled way that supports each song.  These guys have no need to show off - there are plenty of virtuoso riffs and drum fills in their respective back catalogs on which some \\"showing off\\" can be heard.  On this album, it's no-nonsense like a well-executed military mission.  The production is very good, though in my opinion not as balanced as Martin Birch's (the early 80's Dio-era Sabbath).  A high degree of mutual respect and maturity is evident in the complementary playing that does not overstep one another or compete for attention.  The guitar and bass combine to deliver a relentless, rock solid, impenetrable wall of sound that I think has the best yet guitar tone and bass sound of any Sabbath work.  For those who value the \\"feel\\" of heavy music, this is perhaps the finest work of its kind.    Ronnie James Dio delivers his vocals with the guts and golden pipes that distinguish him from all other rock vocalists.  As on past Sabbath albumns, his gift for melodic songwriting and powerful lyrics seamlessly melds with the sonic architecture of Iommi and Butler.  But what struck me about this album is that the melody is more pronounced, more compelling, more from the soul than any past efforts.  Dio's lyrics are more direct and biting, with a riveting intensity and urgency that pulls you into the songs in a way that his fans would recall from his first Dio album \\"Holy Diver\\", although they are less personal.  Each song is unique and stand-alone, but there is a consistent theme of good vs. evil and supernatural metaphor, some of which seems to tie in with themes from even his Rainbow-era songwriting.  Combined, the sonic and lyrical landscape painted by these guys is devastatingly intense and alive.    My only negative comment is that the drums should have been brought up louder in the mix.  Vinny Appice is among the best, playing not only with heart and feel but great technique and finesse.  His signature grace notes and detailed snare work were lost in the mix.    Buy this CD...and play it LOUD!  Unlike almost any album I've owned, it hits you like a fully loaded freight train and draws you in with a peculiar energy to it.  It has an addictive quality that makes you play it over and over!
B000EJ9MTW|1.0|Major disappointment given the comparisons I had heard to the mighty Zep and Black Sabbath. These guys aren't even worthy of carrying those bands' equipment or even wiping their asses for that matter. Not impressed.    Bad songwriting, bad lyrics, boring, unimaginative musical ideas and riffs, and awful overall production of sound. I could make drums sound better in my basement using a four-track recorder. Musicianship? Put in simple terms these guys are hacks!! Honestly, this is a band not ready for the big time. There should have been more time spent honing their craft before anyone heard this outside of Melbourne or where ever they're from (somewhere in Australia). But timing is everything so w/ the whole old school rock nostalgia/revitalization thing going on they got lucky.    There are only two songs on this whole record that MIGHT be worth a listen. One being \\"Woman\\" but even that gets ruined w/ a horrible bridge section that sounds like a train wreck. The other is Apple Tree w/ it's very honest, straight forward \\"punk\\" sounding approach. But that too gets ruined this time by piontless, stupid lyrics.    This is a perfect example of how if you're jonesing for that classic 70's hard rock sound just go back to the sources themselves: Zeppelin, Sabbath, Uriah Heap, Deep Purple, Montrose, etc. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
045122499X|2.0|My impression is that Mr Follet ran out of characters to use. It is very easy to identify characters from Pillars of the Earth. Furthermore, the characters in this book seem to lack strong motivation, driving them throughout the book. Instead, action just seems to flow, without a strong force behind it. Even building the bridge is a pale shadow of the cathedral in the original book.
0385504225|1.0|First off, I'm a big fan of Dan Brown and I loved the first two Robert Langdon books, I mean I loved them! I was really looking forward for The Lost Symbol to come out, I rushed out to get it, and now I'm sorry that I did.<br /><br />The plot is really deep, Robert Langdon has to solve clues inorder to save his friend. It has the usual things Langdon is used to, solving clues, outrunning bad guys and saving the day. The many things that The Lost Symbol was missing was heart and charm that was in the first two books.  As I was reading this, I honestly felt like I was walking through mud.  This was about 100 pages to long.<br /><br />As readers, we don't need to know every single movment, every single thought and and every single action of every single character we meet. That's what Dan Brown does, and it really, really, slows the book down. There are pretty much three things that are going on at once, and when I was taken fron Robert Landon, and forced to read about the other characters, that had nothing to do with the main plot, I was very bored.  I just didnt' care about the other characters.<br /><br />Brown also spends to much time in the past of the secondary characters. We know about all of their pasts, and the thing is that it doesn't move the story forward, but drags it down. We read about two characters who are friends and one is wokring for antoher, and then we learn of their first meeting, and there was no reason. This happens more than a few times and just took away from the action.<br /><br />It's obvious that Dan Brown is a smart man, but the problem, he tells us so much that he knows, again, it brings the story down. I know how to drive a car, but I don't need to know how an engine works.  That's that Dan Brown does in this book, shows us how the engine of a car work, and we don't need to know everything he tells us.<br /><br />I really hate saying all of this because I'm such a hige fan of the first two Robert Langdon adventures. If you want to read this, wait till it comes in paperback, or get it from the library or get it from a friend.  Its' really to bad at I feel this way about the book. I so wanted to like it.get it from the library or get it from a friend.  Its' really to bad at I feel this way about the book. I so wanted to like it.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|You just can't please some \\"fans\\". Whenever a band tries doing something a little bit different, there are those \\"I use to love this band, but what the heck is this?\\" sort of comments.   To me MUSE was never original, but then few bands really are. So if the music is well done, is a lack of originality such a bad thing?   Sure, when I listen to this I hear Radiohead, Queen, Porcupine Tree or some combination there of, but I still can recognize it as MUSE. This release, like the prior ones, is quite well done, a bit more variety here to keep things interesting, so I deem it rather enjoyable.

I would watch another episode, although my college days are long over and normally do not reminisce about the times.  I was an older studious student type with an agenda and did minimal socializing.  I found the sororities too demanding for the amount of support and friendship they offer.  This is the other side of college life where the students learn more about themselves and life from each other than the courses offered at the institution can teach them.  The writers clearly have a sense of humor and that's something everyone needs to get through life easily.

0385504225|2.0|I waited over five years for this book, and could hardly wait to tear the Amazon package open and start reading.    I'm sorry, Dan Brown, but you disappointed me.  It was repetitive, boring, and I have the feeling this may have been Brown's 2nd or 3rd rewrite of the book, and that's why I had to wait all these years.  Not only did National Treasure beat him to the punch, they KO'd him.    What I would really like to see from Brown is an Art History book. I found the Albrecht Durer engraving the most interesting part of the book.
0307155102|5.0|This is one of Richard Scarry's most memorable books.  I loved this book as a child, and my son loves it now.  He consistently grabs this book off his shelf--he loves for us to read together as much as he likes to look at it alone.  There are so many words and pages, that it holds his attention for awhile.<br />This isn't a board book, so the paper pages can easily be torn.  But it is a good way to teach your child how to care for books, and this is one he will likely treasure forever.
1602834865|5.0|For some reason the reviews for the audiobook and the novel have been mixed. So, be aware that my review is for the audiobook as read by Jeremy Irons.<br /><br />I listened to this audiobook before I had even seen Jeremy Irons' wonderful performance in the miniseries, so it can't be said that I was influenced by that. I have never been a fan of his. He made his bones in the types of movies I'd never had a desire to see, and I was never too impressed with his performances when he deigned to appear in movies I would watch. I always found him to be a irritating, one-note actor, doing a bad impression of a stereotypically stiff British aristocrat. However, I could listen to his reading of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" over and over and over again.<br /><br />He has set the benchmark here. His skill in differentiating characters ranks with the best, his vocal delivery approaches musical mellifluence, and his dramatic interpretation is perfection itself. Part of it may have to do with the fact that the source material is as near perfect a book as has ever been written; part may have to do with his having gained an understanding of the novel when he played in the miniseries. But Jeremy Irons has a talent of his own that makes this audiobook a thing of beauty and brings the novel to life. If you loved Brideshead Revisited, I believe you'll cherish this audiobook as much as I do.

B001PR0YFS|3.0|Films like The Informant! have been done before, but Soderbergh's clever direction and several brilliant performances from a strong cast keep this upbeat tale of a downward spiral entertaining throughout, even when the pacing starts to slow. Approached almost like a spy spoof, this quirky true life story of a man deluded by spy grandeur and the denial of the severity of his crimes plays out a little like Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, though the lies and deceit go further against our beguiled protagonist living in a Grisham novel. The Informant! does reinforce the theory that truth is stranger than fiction, provided you can find the truth buried beneath all the layers of fraud, duplicity, and misguided intentions.<br /><br />The industrious Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) has worked for lysine developing company ADM for many years and has even found his way into upper management. But nothing has prepared him for the job he is about to undertake - being a spy for the FBI. Unwillingly pressured into working as an informant against the illegal price-fixing activities of his company, Whitacre gradually adopts the idea that he's a true secret agent. As his incessant lies keep piling up, his world begins crashing down around him.<br /><br />One of the most inventive aspects of The Informant! is the ceaseless, witty, rambling narration by Whitacre, who draws us into his compulsive mind by veering off in unrelated directions. To Mark, multi-tasking is the key to success, and just as he accomplishes many average chores simultaneously during the day, his narration multi-tasks as well, entertaining the audience with random musings while we're chuckling at his more meaningful actions. Even though his condition is mentioned as bipolarity, the film leans toward a case of an overactive imagination, giving his mentality a livelier, upbeat eccentricity. And it's a favorable outcome, as Damon provides an incredibly interesting character.<br /><br />The Informant! takes deception to a whole new level, demonstrating an extremely elusive truth, questionable facts, and flat-out lies. Whitacre sees it as \\"men in white\\" versus \\"men in black\\"; good versus evil. The FBI is once again shown as generally inept, but the lines of decency, honesty and heroism couldn't be more blurred. With a comical covert operation approach, much like James Bond or a character from a Crichton novel turned into a children's cartoon, the film reconstructs a serious situation into a joke-filled, energetic, enjoyable fling.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsating an extremely elusive truth, questionable facts, and flat-out lies.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|When I first listened to the album online, I was a bit unsure. The band did take a HUGE step in another direction, but after a few listens I started to love it. Muse has incorporated so many different elements in this album, that it's MIND BLOWING. Some people might not like it because it doesn't have the basic \\"band\\" sound (like just mainly guitar, bass, and drums) but that what makes them amazing.     Plus, you really get to see Matt's piano skills and orchestrative skills put to use in the album. In Absolution, you got a small taste of it, but now you get the whole meal, like with the Exogenesis Symphony. Brilliant! This is one of the things that sets Muse apart from all other bands.     Uprising-really good rally song. Makes you wanna get up and punch your fist in the air and shout OI! along with the band.  Resistance- I love the opening part of the song, gives me chills.  Undisclosed Desires- I like how the band uses a bit of R&B in their songs. Like with Supermassive Black Hole, I think this one will make it big.  United States of Eurasia- Love the Queen influence. Plus, what other band uses Chopin in their songs? Answer: no, but Muse, and they put it in brilliantly.  Guiding Light- this one was...OK. Kinda sounds like it belongs in the '80s.  Unnatural Selection- this definetly sounds like their earlier selves and it goes perfectly with the theme of the album.  MK Ultra- great sound, and again, perfectly fits in the album theme  I Belong to You- something new from them, and I love it. The reference from Samson and Delilah fits it perfectly, now if I could only understand it (its in French)    I gave the Album five stars becaues I believes it deserves it. Amazing album, and Muse are basically musical geniuses.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I discovered Porcupine Tree about two years ago and they have become my favorite band.  I have always enjoyed progressive music with a synthesizer based sound.  My all time favorite is \\"Supper's Ready\\" by Genesis, but now I find myself listening to Porcupine Tree almost all of the time.  I think my favorite album is \\"Stupid Dream\\" and my favorite song is \\"Shesmovedon;\\" what a great guitar solo.  But now there's \\"The Incident,\\" and it just gets better and better every time I listen to it.  Porcupine Tree just grows on you.  It was the same with FOABP; I listened to it, liked a few songs and after listening to it more... all the songs became better and better.  I have purchased almost all of Porcupine Tree's albums and \\"The Incident\\" is in the top three, and it may move up to number two or even their best as time passes.  What I like about this album is that it's a mix of all of their styles: their early psychedelic era, the more folk rock (Lightbulb Sun) to their more heavy sound since \\"In Absenta.\\"  This is what I like about Porcupine Tree... they are a vast mix of many styles and sounds blended into something that can't be labeled.  The 55 minute song is a fantastic concept and I think they were very successful in achieving it.  Now as I sit and listen to it, I have to wonder... what is next from Steve, Richard, Colin and Gavin, what ever it is... I know it will be fantastic.
0596009208|4.0|I found this book very useful during a Java class I took, but ONLY in conjunction with our textbook, which was much more technical.  This book is excellent in the way it breaks down the difficult concepts involved in Java programming, and makes abstract ideas easier to understand.  The sense of humor is nice too.  Just make sure you have a more nuts-and-bolts book nearby.    The only major gripe I have about \\"Head First Java\\" is that the index is the worst I've ever seen.  Looking up \\"loops\\", for instance, brings up a mere 4 pages, even though there are huge sections of the book that deal with looping methods.  Whoever assembled the index for this book is a disgrace to their profession.  Hopefully, when the 3rd edition comes out, the indexing will be done by someone who knows what they're doing.
B001641ZFS|3.0|While I enjoyed the performances (on period instruments)of the Mozart Violin Concerti and Symphonia Concertante, I did not find them particularly inspiring or arresting. Giuliano Carmignola, a name previously unfamiliar to me, plays the music in a lively and efficient enough fashion. However his tone and interpretive style has not left any lasting positive impression.<br /><br />The orchestral playing under the direction of Claudio Abbado is alert and vital. The recorded sound, while generally satisfying, tends to harshness on occasions and is lacking in a clear bass response. For a complete set I still remain loyal to the vintage Grumiaux /Davis set on Phillips.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I started listening to Muse because of \\"Map Of The Problematique\\".  That song was a must-listen for me EVERYDAY.  Then I got the album and found that the whole thing was awesome.    Amazingly, \\"The Resistance\\" as a whole is an even BETTER album!  It's a lot more artistic and classical - quite different from their previous work in my opinion.      And my favourite song on this album happens to be the song that most people dislike - \\"Undisclosed Desire\\".  That is my everyday song now!  Love the beat.      By the way, the CD+DVD version was SOLD OUT when I visited BestBuy yesterday!  and there were only a few copies of the CD-only version left.
B000NW8Q7Y|5.0|This book was in much better condition than I thought it would be and the price was very fair. It arrived in just a day or two after I placed my order, and I definitely would buy from this seller again.
0385342020|4.0|This book had a slower start than other Kinsella books - the premise of ghost from the 1920's helping the main character, Lara, sort out her own life whilst solving the ghosts own mystery - was not the sort of story I would normally read.  If it had not been by Sophie Kinsella, I would not have even picked up this book.    The story had a average/\\"I might not get past chapter 2 at this rate\\" beginning, and I wasn't enjoying it as much as I had hoped, and then about half way through the book, the characters became truly interesting (and you became involved with them as you do in all of this author's books), the storyline became more enjoyable and your disbelief at the thought of a ghost helping Lara, that disbelief was suspended.      And then I became an avid reader of the story - wanting Lara to succeed, Sadie to continue to entertain and bewitch others, and for some other characters to get what they deserve!   It was a story that crept up on me and despite earlier misgivings, it was a good read.    Sophie Kinsella fans will probably enjoy the great characters that are once again are portrayed on paper though you will find it is a bit of a departure from her other books.  For some readers that may be disappointing and I can understand some of the negative reviews - but I still don't regret the time I spent with this book.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|poorly constructed tale of pseudo science meets phoney religion all wrapped in a thick layer of assumptive reasoning.  badly written and waste of time and money.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Serial killing at its finest and most deserved!  Excellent character development continues in Season 3 of Dexter.  It'll be interesting to see how he trys to live a \\"normal\\" life with Rita & the kids next season.  Intelligent writing and stellar performances by Michael Hall and his series sister, and real life wife, \\"Debra\\" as well as the rest of the cast. Each character is played to the hilt. Can't wait until Season 4.  Trust me, you must see 1, 2 and 3 !!!!
0385504225|5.0|I loved The Lost Symbol.  As I read the novel, I kept thinking of the grief that Dan Brown will receive for what I see as a bold move. The DaVinci Code made Dan Brown a well known author.  Rather than writing a book that relied on his fame, Brown uses mass media and fiction to motivate people to think.  The Lost Symbol, challenges the reader to - look at things differently, read with an open mind, consider the potential of the ideas covered.  I hope that in addition to enjoying the fast pace, absorbing plot, interesting characters and fascinating facts, readers look at the underlying messages.
0385504225|4.0|One of the craziest ideas in this book that proves this is a work of fiction: the Washington Redskins are in the playoffs.    Decent book. Always a mix of facts and crazy conjectures with Dan Brown.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Having grown up in the Star Trek Voyager era, it was always a struggle for me to actually sit down and enjoy TOS. Sure I've seen them, and appreciated what they did for the franchise and the genre. But appreciation and enjoyment are two separate things. That being said, this set on Blu-Ray makes TOS films pure enjoyment. The menu's are impressive, much cooler than the DVD menus in my opinion. The Blu-Ray quality is good, so much better than SD. It isn't consistent however, ST:II looks so impressive, others not so much. But, they all look better than SD. I can't speak for the audio, I don't have surround sound hooked up yet. I haven't gotten through all the extra's, but I feel confident in saying they won't be a disappointment. Take a tip: get it on Amazon for under 70 bucks (not the outrageous 125 many stores are selling it for) and watch it for yourself. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase...oh, the \\"Includes 6 films featuring Kirk and Spock\\" promo comes off nicely, so that extremely ridiculous piece of info won't be a bother.
0385504225|3.0|Don't get me wrong.. This book is a sure page turner.. But if you have read The Da Vinci Code, this one is just the same. Only set in D.C. More code breaking and running.. Dan Brown intersperses hot paced action with some lectures on symbols.Sometimes you just want to turn the page and go the action sequence!... The puzzles are not as engrossing as Da Vinci code.. But the authour's tour of D.C. is impressive...    I also wondered how a man whose hand was severed could go on helping crack symbols as if nothing had happened! masonry perhaps! :)    The book looks to be written just for a movie. You can almost visualise Tom Hanks in the movie.. Beware tom TLV is going to be difficlt :)
B000002VCQ|3.0|Whitney Houston's debut album was great because of Whitney's killer chops but the songs on here are pretty average. Clive Davis thinks he is the best thing that ever existed but he likes to control his artists every move, from picking the songs and what their image should be. Whitney should've been given better material than these run-of-the-mill pop tunes. How Will I Know is still my favorite Whitney song but overall, Whitney was told what to do and that's never a good thing.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy has an awesome voice. Every one of the songs on this CD was GREAT, NOT 1 BAD SONG!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|loved it.  yes it is similar to browns other books but its his style.  you either love or you dont.  i will read it again. as oes member i thought handled the whole explanation very well.  will recommend to everyone.  enjoyed the fact that i recognized/visited many of the sites in the book.  willmake me look twice when travel again.  felt the same with all of his other books.  will read whateverhe comes up with next
0312360266|3.0|The real story started towards 3/4 f the book, unnecessary scenes, excessive pop culture citation, and under develop characters. The story does have a very interesting plot so I am hoping that this will get better. Reading the book was fun but the element of the usual fantasy-paranormal tenor was low for a second I thought I was reading Gossip Girls.       There are reminders that they are vampire fledgling, no one will miss it. \\"Zoey and her Crescent Moon Mark\\" and that Zoey is special because the goddess vampire Nyx has chosen her. But other than that, it consist of complaints about raccoon eyes, hags from hell, drinking, smoking, sex, hypocrisy, etc..I get it that this book is more for the teenagers but it all sounds pretentious and Zoey is very Mary Sue that it contradicts with the bloodlust part and her raging hormones when she is near Erik. I wonder if the Mother-Daughter tandem in writing has anything to do with it.      Let's talk about the Daughters of the Night. It was more of like a social circle for the rich, beautiful and snotty than an actual organization that insinuates importance. So stripping Aprodithe of her power to lead that group was a nice touch, so I am giving this series another try, in the hopes that Zoey's character exceeds expectations that would really make a difference in her vampire world.
B00029D0H4|5.0|This is the third car carrier our son has had and the only one we'd recommend.  He got a hotwheels one which broke quickly and was hard to use (hard to change the ramps and things to load cars on and off).  He got a $30 one that had a nice metal cab but a plastic back and the plastic back broke quickly.  The company sent a replacement which also broke quickly.  Then we found this one.  Siku (by Ravensburger) has since become our favorite line of vehicles for our son (who is now 6 but has been enjoying them since the age of 3-4).  They are pricey but also are extremely realistic and incredibly well made.  This one is sized to fit standard matchbox and hotwheels vehicles and has held up to several years of use.  Highly recommended!
0385504225|4.0|*Spoilers Alert*    After months and months of surmise on what will our Robert Langdon will decode this time, we are finally here. So for the people who weigh that it will be about the Temple, Atlantis, Bermuda Triangle or something about a religious sect, -wrong. This time Brown decided - Freemasons. I've watched too many Discovery and History channel for this one yet reading about them and the \\"supposedly\\" initiation and practices did not surprise me but reading it on Dan brown's novel is diverse.         The usual tenor are still there. Langdon gets summoned to go somewhere that, well hello - he has to solve a mystery and since he is professor or symbology and all that he got into the middle of it. The profligate is someone who have grotesque looks. This time his name is Mal'akh, dude was covered in tattoos from acientt symbols/signs, pillars to a double headed phoenix on his chest, etc. he is probably the most bizarre and insane villain out of all Langdon books. And let's not forget soemthing gruesome to start off. This time its a hand. Severed hand skewered on a wood to be exact with tattoos of the Ancient Mysteries with the index finger pointing upward. (I hope you are not eating while reading this) Lastly,  historical facts and fictions were amalgamated, and of course something that people can look up at the world wide web. I for one is a victim of this, took me awhile to finish the book because I have to find out what and where is 1733 16th St. NW and 4210 Silver Hill Rd. Grinning like an idiot,. I found out that the 1st one is The Scottish Masons - Supreme Council 33 degree and the 2nd one is the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural history. I also admit to calling the phone number 202-329-5746 out of curiosity. Brown must have put that there for some reason right? and I interpret it as \\"you must find out what this is\\". You may also find yourself researching about Noetic Science, OS, the Invisible College, SMSC and more.      I admit, I got lost on some parts, so I have to pause and digest what I just read. The theme / plot ruminate around this Ancient Mysteries and Katherine's research and goal in life - the use of advance science to rediscover what the lost knowledge the ancient world had unveiled about our universe. I wouldn't even bash about the flaws, I'd let the professional book critic do that. As a fan of Brown's - I'd say this book is brilliant, suspenseful, informative, highly intriguing, it kind of gave me a new perspective on the eventful prediction that is supposed to happen on 2012 and it made me want to go back to D.C and examine the capitol a little to closely. In short it an enjoyable diversion from the real world. Highly recommended.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|It's getting a bit old heaping superlatives on Mark Knopfler but with his newest release, Get Lucky, I find myself wondering - is the man capable of putting out a bad record? On the heels of 2007's remarkable, Kill To Get Crimson, Knopfler continues walking in the Celtic tradition - spinning wonderfully passionate tales of everyday longing and mortality into tightly choreographed slice-of-life vignettes that could only be told by a man who now has more life in the rear view mirror than beyond the hood.     Celtic inspired music may be scary to some - but this is clearly not your father's Jethro Tull - who towards the end slouched towards parody - mistakenly thinking Celtic meant leprechauns and fairies jamming in an Irish Spring commercial.     In Knopfler's hands, the entire project becomes the haunting and reflective work of an adult male summoning all of his considerable gifts of storytelling and musicianship. As with most of MK's solo ventures, the isolation of individual songs really takes away from the cumulative power of the entire release - Knopfler is an increasingly rare breed who is unafraid to go wherever the music takes him. Get Lucky and Get Lucky!
B001ECQ6PG|1.0|This is my second posting of this review.  I believe Amazon deleted my first review for reasons beyond me.  However, I bought the PT-01 usb to archive my vast vinyl collection.  It worked great at first, but then the pitch began to fluctuate, which is very noticeable when sustained chords are played in a song.  This is also disastrous for any djs archiving their vinyl, because the bpm's must stay constant for mixing.  I took my unit in for repair and they replaced the belt drive.  It worked great after that....for about two months and then the same thing happened.  It appears that the belts being supplied for these turntables are of inferior quality and wear with age.  Unacceptable.  The other features on this unit are useless.  I don't really see a need for a built-in speaker, nor battery-powered capabilities.  I don't imagine anyone will be taking these to the beach.  That said, save your money until a better usb turntable comes out on the market.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|Eminem is one of the best rappers of all time like one of his songs says he will be one tough act to fellow. The Re-up has a lot of great songs as well as some the best rappers on this CD. I like Jimmy crack corn,shady narcotics, and many others. I hope he continues to perform and continue to put great CDs. I like many rappers but Eminem is by far my favorite. All the critics that want hassle him just makes him more popular they should shut up and let his true fans enjoy his performance and his CDs.

B001PPLKI0|5.0|Four CD's loaded with the great gospel songs, some that I'd never heard Elvis sing. \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is beautiful!  A truly inspirational collection.
B001IZID3W|5.0|When i first heard \\"Nine in the afternoon\\" i loved it. Then a fan of both panic and the beatles recomened i buy the album. i was hesitant at first but after listening to the album i became an instant fan. The songs are genious, catchy and very easy to sing along with. I love this band with such a great name. Sonically the album is nearly perfect. As both a fan of Panic at the disco and the beatles i highly recommend you give the album a good listening to before bashing the band about ripping off Stg peppers. The band members clearly state that the beatles are a major influence and it shows but they did NOT rip off sgt peppers. Great 5 star album!
0385504225|1.0|Starting with the first few chapters I sensed that we were subjected to a formulated Dan Brown book. With all my goodwill I thought it was OK. It is kind of normal and expected from a novel to be formed using a best selling technique, which in fact in this case is the \\"comic-book structure\\" with the intellectual main character, a well-educated, wealthy and powerful Mason, his scientist sister and of course the mysterious villain chasing them in a historical city. The book proved to be a painfully boring read but I forced myself to go on until chapter 51. Dan Brown had copy-pasted his previous novels up to that point but using the Turkish prison as a setting with the \\"obese, alcoholic, spineless, sadistic prison administrator\\" cliché??? This character was exploited, actually sucked up to its bones over 30 years ago by a movie already!.So, I believe Dan Brown has googled \\"best-sold clichés ever\\" and has come up with this caricatured warden. As a proud Turkish woman I'm so bored of the mentioned movie and the prejudice that it caused, I didn't let this book which is full of circling repeats, tire my eyes anymore...
B002BSHWUU|3.0|There is an unfortunate tendency for dozens of folks to just put five stars on anything with the Beatles name on it.  I am that much of a Beatle fan, but to be realistic I think it would be more helpful for potential buyers if the review compared the various incarnations of Beatle material out there so that buyers can make an informed decision about what is right for them.  There really is not a definitive package of Beatle recordings.  Each has it's own magic and benefits and you just need to figure out what you are after.<br /><br />As for me, so you know, my background is a musician and recording studio owner with 32 years of experience.  As for my perspective in comparing Beatle recordings, I've owned the entire Beatles catalog, both American and British versions, in multiple and various pressings on vinyl LP, as well as many unique foreign pressings, cassette and some 8-tracks.  I currently have the 1980's box, the Capitol box sets, the Apple remastered stereo box and the Apple remastered mono box and I've been listening to them all side-by-side for this review.<br /><br />I think buyers of these discs may fall into a few key categories:<br />1. Long-time Beatle fans who had the original LPs<br />2. Audiophiles who are looking for the most pristine audible version<br />3. Young/new fans who just want a nice copy of everything<br /><br />In short, I'd recommend the following for the respective categories:<br />1. Apple remastered mono box or Capitol box set, rounded out with individual missing discs<br />2. Apple remastered stereo box<br />3. The previously-available 1980's box set<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />For category 1, the remastered mono box set (or the Capitol box sets, which are stereo and mono) may be the way to go, then just round it out with the individual copies of the missing discs.  The mono box has much better sound reminiscent of the original LPs and far superior packaging.  The mono remasters mimick the original LP packaging even down tospine text and the paper inner sleeves!  Each disc in the mono set has a resealable outer plastic sleeve (Japanese style) and a plastic inner sleeve to protect the actual disc.  The box itself affords direct access to any CD without disturbing the others and the overall box is the size of CDs, so it fits nicely on your CD shelf.<br /><br />The remastered stereo box is a terrible package.  It's 12\\" high and vertical, doesn't fit on the shelf with other CDs.  You can't access any CD individually.  Instead you have to lift this cloth strap to pull an entire stack of CDs out to get to the one you want, frequently spilling the others everywhere like a deck of cards.  You are forced to grab the disc surface to get it out of the cardboard sleeve it's in.  Only the front cover reproduces the original artwork.  Everything else, back, inside and booklet, while it's nice that there are new, never-before seen photos, makes it hard to reminisce if you remember the original LPs.  But for audiophiles and new fans, this packaging might be fine, or even preferred.<br /><br />The benefit of the remastered stereo CD packaging is that the original liner notes are printed in a booklet for each disc, so they are easy to read.  The remastered mono CDs only have the original liner notes on the back cover, as they were on the LPs, but this is difficult if not impossible to read.  The mono set also lacks the album recording notes that the stereo box has.  Only notes for the past masters discs seems to be included in the mono set.<br /><br />The stereo CDs themselves have significantly different sound from the original LPs.  Whether you consider it better is subjective depending on your listening goals.  For example, Please Please Me (and all other discs that Paul Hicks remastered) seem to be bass-heavy compared to the original LPs and CD sets.  While it's quite an improvement that you can now hear the bass lines clearly and the balance seems more up to date with modern recordings, it just won't be as familiar to those who owned all the original albums.  Additionally, the beautiful reverb tails that were on the original Please Please Me album seem to decay quicker on the remaster. (Possibly due to various limiting/compression/eq artifacts?)<br /><br />The real benefit of the remastered stereo box sound is that you can now clearly hear many of the little things that were previously buried in the mix.  For example, all details of the moog parts on Something and Maxwell's Silver Hammer are completely and clearly audible.  It's beautiful and incredible sounding.  Layers of overdubbed parts across the box set are clearly audible, which is a treat to hear clearly for the first time.<br /><br />There are a very few cases, however, where this isn't true.  One very small example is on Don't Bother Me.  Early in the song George can be heard saying \\"Fast\\" on the backing track, but only on the Capitol box set is this completely and clearly audible with the level of detail other tracks in the Apple stereo box have.  This gets back to my point that there really isn't one definitive set.  Details come out differently in different versions.  There are also some strange artifacts of this latest stereo remaster.  For example, on Maxwell's Silver Hammer, the lead vocal occasionally seems to shift between being perfectly centered to splitting into a duophonic kind of sound from both the left and right.  None of my other copies exhibit this characteristic.  I believe this may be caused by phase artifacts introduced in the remastering from the heavy processing required to being out all the details.  I also noticed that on some songs the lead vocals actually were quieter than on other available CD editions, possibly caused by the same.<br /><br />The short movies included on the CDs and the DVD are sometimes interesting, but not great.  There are a few comments buried in there that I had never heard before, but there are also strange inaccuracies; like seeing stills from Paperback Writer/Rain promo films during the Rubber Soul segment.  In general, the movies are only a bonus for Beatle completists, due to a couple details that are revealed.  They aren't terribly enlightening otherwise.<br /><br />While the mono set lacks the videos, the bonus of the mono set is the complete original cover art (front, back and inside, where applicable) as well as all the original inserts, e.g. the 4 individual photos from the white album and the original green cut-out card in Sgt. Pepper, not to mention the groovy rose-to-pink paper inner sleeve, etc.<br /><br />These sets are a bit overpriced.  If the stereo set had the mono packaging, then it would be worth the price.  The mono box really should be reduced to the price of the stereo set or less, particularly since it's no longer a limited edition (or at least the edition has been expanded such that it's not as much of a rarity now) and it doesn't have all the music or extras (no booklet for each album, no movies).<br /><br />The terrible packaging, the overpriced price tag and significant deviation from the original sound (in general) knocks the remastered stereo box down to 3 stars for me.  (Yes hearing all the little details is great for me as a fan, but the tonal balance was compromised notably to get that, and that is not how these albums were originally mastered nor intended to sound by George Martin and the band themselves.  I think these details could have been brought out reasonably without changing the sound as much as they have.)  Because of the cost and significant differences from the original cover art and sound, I can't consider the stereo remaster a 'definitive' set, but rather a supplement to the others sets that are available.<br /><br />The mono remaster box however, I give 5 stars for having pristine sound without sacrificing the original tonality of these legendary recordings, having the original LP packaging and inserts, much better protection of the discs and sleeves, as well assized to fit on a CD/DVD shelf.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />If you are a long-time fan who wants to reminisce and re-experience the original LPs, I would suggest either the new Apple remastered mono box set or Capitol box sets, then round it out with any individual discs missing.<br /><br />For the new fan who wants a copy of everything but isn't nit picking over whether they can hear John say, \\"Cranberry Sauce\\" on Strawberry Fields or whether everything is in mono or stereo, the previous 1980's box set would be just fine.  You might even find it used/cheap on an auction site, now that these remastered boxes are available.  For what it's worth, the previous 1980's box set actually does sound like the original LPs.  It's just that people are listening to them on modern equipment.  Those mixes were originally created for equipment with tube amplifiers and real wood speaker cabinets, which impart a great deal of bass and warmth to the sound.  Putting the same mix through printed circuit board stereos with modern plastic little speakers doesn't quite work with the music to produce the intended result.<br /><br />For the audiophile who must hear the creaking chair on the final chord of Sgt. Pepper in stereo, the newly-remastered stereo box would be the way to go.  The remastered stereo set is also good for anyone who wants to read the original liner notes from the albums and learn more about how the albums were originally recorded.<br /><br />For the Beatle-completist who must have a every version of a Beatle recording, I'm assuming you already own the 1980's box, the Capitol boxes, the Apple-remastered stereo and the mono box sets prior to reading this review, and there is no review that would help you, since a Beatle purchase is compulsory.

B000AXWV40|5.0|This is one of those albums that you look back on years later & realize that a major shift in music history was underway. The \\"Funkadelic\\" side of George Clinton's mighty army was on the rise along side it's \\"Parliament\\" alter ego and what they produced with this album is simply amazing!  The album show cases, in my opinion, the Greatest Guitarist Ever to pick up the instrument, Edward Earl Hazel.<br /><br />He has always in some ways lived under the shadow of Jimi Hendrix due to being a black guitarist playing with a \\"rock-n-roll\\" feel to his music. Most people consider these 2 to be somewhat different & unique cause rock is mostly associated with \\"white\\" acts. It must be remembered that rock is a child born of it's mother and father, jazz & blues.  Eddie like Jimi was a master of both & the feeling he brought forth when he played was other worldly.<br /><br />The title cut is a symphony of pure and passionate brillance. His guitar tells a story of sadness, pain, renewal & ultimate joy.  Prior to recording, George asked him to imagine that he found out his mother had died & then later realize that instead she was in fact still alive!<br /><br />The ride he takes you on is simply amazing! Other notable tracks are \\"Hit it & Quit It\\" & \\"Super Stupid\\" where Hazel rips into a flurry of guitar glory complete with wah wah peddle & special effects!  The additional tracks in this release are a nice addition to the original album.  I highly recommend this album especially to anyone whose just getting into the wonder that is The Parliaments & The Funkadelics!
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Jean Reno is Leon, a genuine Italian hitman with a sleazy wardrobe, a gun case, and a cheap apartment, who does \\"cleaning\\" tasks for the boss. He lives down the hall from teen Mathilda (Natalie Portman) whose family is brutally murdered in their apartment by a corrupt police squad led by psycho chief detective Stansfield (Gary Oldman) after her father fails to return stolen drugs. Leon, having witnessed the crime through a keyhole, then comforts Natalie and allows her to stay with him and the two develop a relationship that becomes an unlikely partnership of vengence.     Reno and Portman deliver excellent performances, but it is Oldman who provides the needed offbeat sadism in his character that adds to the film's intensity and makes the story work. Before a raid, the stressed Stansfield pops a few amphetamines and appears to go into a trance while imagining a triumphant symphony as the battle ensues. The Professional is a unique and enjoyably satisfying violent movie.
B0007RO57U|5.0|This double cd is part of an integral recording of Handel's keyboard suites on piano by the legendary Sviatoslav Richter and renowned Andrei Gavrilov.  Andrei Gavrilov was still a littleknown and young pianist, when these life performances were recorded. Since then, he slowly built up an impressive set of recordings of which his Bach and Prokoffief are perhaps most notable. Sadly he seems to have ceased recording. As is obvious from these performances, the young Gavrilov does not pale in comparison with the epic presence of the great Sviatoslav Richter. The legend even noted, that most people could not tell the difference between the two pianists playing the Handel piano Canon integrally: taking turns every two suites.  As for the music: one of the mysteries of baroque music is surely the sparse recordings of this marvelous music. Keyboard music from the baroque era  is automatically compared to that of Bach, as his prodigious and without exception iconic output has eclipsed anything else from that period. Handel though, is a master in his own right. While Bach has influenced the music on the continent, Handel is even greater on the British Isles. Mainly because of his Oratoria and Operas, which in a way are reflected into keyboard suites who share the same intense lyrical quality.  This music is more relaxed, intimate and sunny compared to Bach's suites. Handel's language is characterized by a poetic, yet expansive quality, sometimes reminiscent of Beethoven's late piano sonates = which were heavily influenced by Handel. When listening to these recordings, it's obvious that the music is rendered with understanding and love...The soul of these pieces is purveyed with a delicacy and urgency that shines in comparison with the many baroque piano recordings that have followed since then. The recording has a very spontaneous and almost improvisational feel to it, that's very appealing. Like Bach, this music clears my mind and lifts me up, yet seems more personal and playful...  Richter and Gavrilov have succeeded in bringing the warmth and joy of Handel's to the surface, combined with his virtuosity and unique style that seems to capture many unknown pearls of wisdom... I cannot but highly recommend this music and this version to anyone who loves piano and baroque music.

B000002KIE|5.0|This is the best album ever.  Perfect in every way.  He who does not like it, in fact does not like rock.  If you are more into samba, rumba or cha-cha-cha, than you will probably HATE this Never Mind.    The Sex Pistols did not need to record another album.  This is their ultimate one.  Whatever other album would be necessarily worse than this one Bollocks...
0688172377|5.0|This autobiography tells the extraordinary itinerary of Waris Dirie from a run away nomad child at the age of twelve in Somalia to a fashion super model working all over the world.    As a nomad child living in the desert, Waris Dirie was part of pure nature, pure life, where the simplest things (rain, a sack of rice) were appreciated as a gift from heaven. Every drop of water was respected as a precious commodity. She lived without a calendar along the lines traced by the sun.  Once in the West, she was astonished that so many people were preoccupied with NOT eating and were bankrupt of time.    However, this `paradisiacal' life was extremely painfully and severely impaired by two major events.  She was circumcised at the age of five (clitoris, labia minora and most of the labia majora were cut off). The wound was stitched leaving only a minuscule hole (the diameter of a matchstick) for peeing and periods. The `operation' was made with a broken razor blade containing dried blood on the jagged edge of the blade. The `doctor' spat on it and wiped it against her dress. Many children die as a result of this mutilation as they bleed to death, are infected by bacteria (tetanus) or don't survive the psychological shock.  This expensive intervention was considered a good investment, as virgins are a hot commodity on the African marriage market (the real unspoken reason for circumcision). In fact, children are treated as cattle and can be exchanged for other cattle (camels).    The second event was her arranged marriage at the age of twelve with a man of sixty for five camels. She ran away from home all alone. A most remarkable life story began.    Notwithstanding her horrible ordeal (`I will never know the pleasures of sex. I feel a cripple'), Waris Dirie continues to love her family.  The real culprits are men. `The tribal wars in Somalia, like the practice of circumcision are brought about by the aggression and selfishness of men. Both acts stem from their obsession withtheir territory and their possessions including women. Perhaps if we cut their balls off, Somalia would become a paradise without that constant surge of testosterone, there'd be no war, no killing, no thieving, no rape.'  For her, like for everybody, peace is one of the greatest benefits of all.    This autobiography is a must read for all those who want to know from where we all come from (nomads).
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Exactly what you would expect from Brown: lots of interesting etymology, double-entrendres and word substitution grids in the plot, along with some wonderful kernels of interesting history, and cool little objects that are key to the story. The evil guy is truly twisted, and you get learn a lot more about historical tidbits of Washington DC.  But unfortunately, the plot twists were also downright Brownesque.  I caught every one of them about five pages before they were revealed. I'm not sure that's all bad, but the only thing I did not guess was the ending.  I guess there was one, sort of.    My wife happened to come home from a trip just as I was finishing the book, on my Kindle (which is difficult to guage exactly where you are in a book).  I told her that I had to just finish the last page,and I would be with her, little knowing that there were another FORTY pages or so, which really is just padding.    After reading that the lost \\"symbol\\" in question was \\"real\\" in about 85 different statements in the book, imagine my surprise when it was really metaphorical after all, at least in my judgment. Same ending as \\"The Celestine Prophecy.\\"(Movie version) Disappointing, but I enjoyed the book's history and detail. There were two annoying things about the book. 1) repeated identical phrases/terms which could have easily been re-worded and caught by word check, and 2) Langdon clings sooooo annoyingly to his lack of faith.  \\"I can't believe, I can't believe,\\" over and over and over until I just wanted to slap him.  He is surrounded by people who do believe and he is threated by a maniac who DOES believe.  Anybody as smart as Professor Langdon would stop crying like a baby about it and get on point: catching the villain.      The best part of the book was including the Noetics angle, which I enjoyed because I am a great fan of McTaggart's work, if not her ego. She'll sell another million reprints, no doubt.  It's fascinating stuff, and Brown does us a favor by bringing it to our collective attention.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|If you're looking for great literature, read the classics!  If you want a page turner and would like to reconnect with Harvard symbologist,  Robert Langdon, you should enjoy The Lost Symbol. The story also gives an interesting look at the history and art of Washington, D.C.  At 509  pages it is still a quick read!  A movie version will probably be around in a couple of years.  I thought it was fun to get the Kindle version and read it on the day of release.  Also Amazon kept the price reasonable at $9.99!

B002GZQYMK|5.0|These past couple of releases from the biggest British rock bands, mainly Coldplay and Keane, have seen an attempt by these artists to reinvent their sound in an effort to avoid becoming stale.  And although I have grown to love and accept their latest releases, I do feel that the essence from these bands was obscured somewhat.  In other words, I didn't feel like I was listening to Coldplay anymore.  Thankfully, this is not the case with The Resistance.  Muse has managed to produce an album that is different, yet preserves the band you know and love. The Muse that combines an eclectic and inspired combination of funky, electronica, rock, and classical sounds.  And believe me this album is very inspired.  While listening to the album, I felt like I was experiencing audible art.  It really hit me how incredibly creative this trio is.  Every track here is a hit, from the danceable, \\"Undisclosed Desire,\\" to the experience that is \\"Exogenesis:  Symphony,\\" (and yes, this is a symphony in the true sense of the word).  I'm not going to run down each song here like some reviewers, but if you've listened to their first single, \\"Uprising,\\" things only get better from there.  5 stars!
0439023491|5.0|Once you come up for air you might find that even though this, the next book in the Hunger Games Series, is still probably on your list for one of the best books you have ever read, it is not as good as the first. So much happens in the book and the author chooses to scrunch a large amount of time into a few sentences, or one chapter. The detail that I loved in the first book is sacrificed for moving the story on quicker. However, when the narration slows down to the familiar pace, the detail described does not fail to impress. This book did not have me on the edge of my seat like the Hungers Games but I expect that the next book will do just that.

B001PPLKI0|5.0|It's wonderful to hear Elvis's most stunningly gorgeous music {whatever your belief system} in the best possible sound quality. The only kick about it is that a few important songs are missing, and one is a song that Elvis REALLY didn't like. \\"Life\\" is that song: Elvis seemed certain, according to those who've heard his taped comments, that it was the same melody as \\"My Little Friend\\" - a nice \\"little\\" song, stretched out and overblown with blustery lyrics. Instead, without a doubt, \\"Miracle of the Rosary\\" should have been substituted: I hope it is not because it is considered a \\"Catholic\\" song, because Elvis clearly wanted to do it, and did it very well indeed: he did not, and the producers must know this, have any such prejudices. In fact, \\"Let Us Pray\\" is a \\"religious social consciousness song\\" {a mouthful, I know} sung in a CATHOLIC FOLK MASS in the film \\"Change of Habit.\\" Elvis revised his vocal twice that year because he cared so much about the song. It is clear, thus, that \\"Miracle of the Rosary\\" should have been included. Perhaps it was a tape problem: an audio glitch or something which is perhaps why they couldn't use it. One does not know.<br />One more thing: his 1970 version of \\"Farther Along\\" should definitely have been included, regargless of \\"sound quality\\" diffiuculties. It is a radical re-imagining of the song: it sounds almost like a \\"field holler\\" and may stem from early childhood memories from those unpleasant visits to the Mississippi Delta. In other words, Elvis may have heard ACTUAL field hollers from Delta farm workers back when he was a tot in 1938. Elvis usually got his most socially significant musical innovations from live music throughout his very early youth, so this is a possibility. In any case, I recommend listeners get the \\"That's The Way It Is\\" box to hear this one and a blistering version of \\"Oh, Happy Day.\\" On \\"Farther Along\\" you can hear the Sweet Inspirations almost thrown off for a few bars 'till they caught the strange rhythm. His original was once described as having a \\"dirgelike\\" tempo, but this goes way, way beyond that. It is probably not the \\"Farther Along\\" that many people remember from their youth, and that is an even MORE important reason to include it and make an attempt to improve the sound quality as much as humanly possible.<br />\\"Hide Thou Me\\" is beyond extraordinary.<br />No other complaints that stand out at this time. Fantastic work, guys, and this has been a difficult year in many ways: Elvis always brought people inner peace and outward togetherness through his best music. So, thanks.<br />Perhaps future versions could add a few \\"bonus songs.\\" And if you must include \\"Life,\\" well, okay.<br />Oh, by the way, I am compiling a personal-use-only CD of all of Elvis's \\"social consiousness\\" songs, and some of these will certainly qualify. I promise not to make copies for friends. They will have to buy the songs themselves, and make their own list for either IPod or CD recordable. I reall DO want the record biz to survive and I mean that!!<br />(Though I will include it in my little collection, I disagree with Elvis's conclusion on \\"Bosom of Abraham\\" that because \\"the rich man lives; he lives so well, {with his glory and honor},\\" that \\"I've a home in hell.\\" Elvis did so much good for so many and taught people, including his own child, love and compassion, that he is definitely in heaven somewhere! He would be about a decade younger than my very energetic and happily working dad today {and B.B. King, etc.}, but he's been gone so long that you realize that he really had his life ahead of him: it's very tragic and still quite sad, yet he left us with such beautiful gifts. Let's appreciate them, even when we quibble.)<br />All the best,<br />rm
B0000VCZKW|4.0|I like to get my daughter to read books, before she sees the film - where possible. Matilda is a book that had us both engrossed for a couple of days. We read (I read mostly) whilst she ate, swam in the pool and almost slept for as long as it took. It is a wonderful story for 7 year olds and grown ups alike.  We both agreed that the book was better, more detail, more suspense and more laughs, but the film was great icing on the cake. Enough to scare the living daylights out of us all (Trunchbull) and make us all relish the power of the individual. Now a slightly dated film, but the power of Roald Dahl is timeless. We are a couple of real fans!
B000SINT52|4.0|Obviously slanted to fit Moore's far left ideas, but the information presented is quite interesting. It doesn't necessarily blame Bush for 9/11, but it shows his past connections and actions after 9/11. You have to take certain things with a grain of salt, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|One of the coolest new features on this box set is called Mobile-Blu.  This application allows you to use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a remote control for the movie. Another cool feature of Mobile-Blu is the tab called Content To Go. This allows you to transfer the special features video and exclusive interview video directly to your iPhone or iPod Touch.  The special features video is then stored on your phone for you to watch whenever you want without needing the Blu-ray discs.  I didn't have time to watch all of the special features over the weekend, so I transferred them to my iPhone to watch on the way to work.    So, on top of the quality of this box set I feel that Mobile-Blu really adds a few very cool new features never seen before in Blu-ray.  I can't wait to see where they take this Mobile-Blu thing to next.

0061766089|5.0|Several books and many articles have been written about the business practices and design accomplishments of the iconic Industrial Design firm IDEO.  But, this most recent text instructs and invites the reader to participate in Design Thinking and Problem Solving.  Beginning with a mind map to supplement the table of contents Tim Brown escorts the reader in a multi-threaded adventure in the sometimes systematic, sometimes serendipitous world of design based problem solving; including methods for brainstorming, visualization and prototyping in a variety of environments. He demonstrates and invites the reader to share the methods of thinking and acting which have resulted in true innovation not only in product form and function, but in new experiences in hospitals, amusement parks and in life-saving design and engineering efforts for the Third World. Other books illustrate the design process and share the beautiful results achieved by Product Design and Development professionals, but aside from this book and Henry Dreyfuss' \\"Designing for People\\" which is so influential it was reprinted after half a century no other text shows the reader how to think and act as designer; a skill so necessary in solving the complex problems of modern life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this short text, not only to the artist, or engineer but to all concerned citizens who hope to make a contribution in solving the problems of their own life and those of a global society.<br /><br />--Ira Laefsky<br />Information Technology and HCI Consultant

B0025KVLUQ|3.0|I'm a fan of the Beatles and of this album in particular, so I decided this would be the first newly remastered CD I would purchase. Having listened to the 1987 CD many times, I was all set to hear differences between the old CD and the remastered version.<br /><br />Sorry, there is no difference!  Or if there is, it's so slight as to be insignificant.  Now, this could be a case where the original album was recorded on good enough equipment that remastering wasn't necessary. But I listened to songs side by side, and both CDs seemed to have about the same amount of hiss (very little), and in each case the fidelity of each instrument and the vocals were crystal clear. I've read other reviews citing discoveries made not present in the 1987 version, but trust me, those sounds are just as clear on the older CD.<br /><br />My advice: If you own the 1987 version, keep it. The new CD comes with a booklet of photos, which is nice, but the trade-off for that feature is that the case itself is the cheap cardboard type.
B002CNV52A|2.0|Wow, this album is the worst for them this far I think.  Musically it's all there, they are still by far some of the greatest musicians on the planet...  but....*sigh*  I have heard these same lyrics from them for 5 albums now.  And what's worse..they are using some of the same guitar riffs, and bass lines we have heard before..(\\"right of passage\\" I'm looking at you)  I get the feeling they are running out of ideas.    Maybe they need to take a few years off..go do some mushrooms for a while...read a few good books...  This album bores me to tears..and I really tried to like it.  But it's just more of the same old crap, only worse.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|After a fairly lackluster fourth season, the producers of Desperate Housewives knew they needed to do something fairly dramatic to reinvigorate the series. What they did - jumping ahead five years in the ladies' lives - certainly wasn't untried, but it was a big gamble given fans' strong attachment to these characters. In true soap fashion, the twists and turns were dramatic, surprising, and in some cases a bit crazy.<br /><br />Assuming you're a fan and have kept up on goings-on to this point, a brief summary looks like this:<br /><br />Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season finds Lynette (Felicity Huffman) in more banal suburban drama, with a teenage son chasing cougars and a husband who continues to live largely in his own head, ignoring everything around him. Bree (Marcia Cross) has become a minor superstar with her Martha Stewart-esque line of products and recipes, which doesn't go over well with her ex-con husband (Kyle MacLachlan), who takes it as an attack on his machismo. How does he vent those frustrations? He turns to kleptomania, of course.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mike (James Denton) and Susan (Teri Hatcher) are suffering a failing marriage as a result of a car crash; an unfortunately all-too-easy and overused dramatic device borrowed from daytime dramas. The only good thing about the split are the objects of their affections: Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delaney) and Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold); unfortunately, respectively.<br /><br />The clear winner of the \\"Oh my God, no they didn't!\\" award for appalling changes clearly goes to Gabby (Eva Longoria-Parker), who's not only gained \\"a few pounds,\\" but now runs around in sweats with her fat daughters and struggles to take care of her poor blind husband (Ricardo Chavira).  Her biggest problems however, involve the struggle of knowing her daughter will never be a beauty queen... and keeping her away from ice cream, cake and French fries.<br /><br />The storyline that ties the ladies together revolves around Edie's (Nicolette Sheridan) husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough). Although he's got most of the neighborhood fooled, Karen (Kathryn Joosten) and her sister (Lily Tomlin) know something's going on. (They may not know of his affliction for murder, but the fact that he talks to himself prompts them to begin snooping.) But what's his secret? Sadly - at least for many gay viewers - this season finds less witty social criticism and charm, and more simple melodrama.<br /><br />Whether or not the \\"surprise flash-forward\\" injected new life into the series is up to you; reviews have been mixed. Having the complete series on DVD however - and being able to watch the entire season in fewer sittings - does make it easier to swallow such a dramatic leap.<br /><br />&lt;slug>Special Features&lt;/slug><br /><br />The \\"extras\\" for Desperate Housewives: Season 5 are fairly standard, but also pretty juicy. The first and 13th episodes of the season feature Commentary Tracks, largely focused on the decision and rationale behind the flash forward plot device. The track on the 100th episode - featuring creator Marc Cherry and actress Brenda Strong - also provides a hint of clarity behind a couple of the more obtuse storylines, tying in real life events (namely Mr. Cherry's loss of a \\"close friend\\") to plot points in the series.<br /><br />Perhaps the most prominent extra is a featurette on the 100th episode - Desperate Housewives: Evolution of a modern classic - which features interviews with the actors, producers, and others involved in the series. This behind-the-scenes look at the production gives a bit of a glimpse into what goes into making a series, the relationships forged, and some of the on-set craziness. It also shows an early table read, which is fun, and something fans will definitely enjoy.<br /><br />Cherry Picked is a brief commentary from the series creator, in which he talks about the moments of the show that mean the most to him. Additional features - which shouldn't be missed - include the standard Bloopers and Deleted Scenes.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've read reviews where some claim the only difference between these new remasters vs. the 1987 collection is volume. Not sure what kind equipment they're using to listen to these with, maybe a cassette player or a crummy Emerson CD player that's at least 15 years old? I'm sure I have some hearing loss from attending multiple loud concerts like ACDC, Van Halen, Ozzy etc. But even I can hear the astonishing difference between these recordings and the ones from 1987. Everything is far more pronounced - vocals are crisper, highs are higher and lows are lower. I hear things in these recordings I hadn't heard before and I've been a fan for more than 30 years. The muffled sounds are gone as is the dull hissing. Some are saying the Beatles never intended the music to be released in this manner...i.e. stereo. Then why would they have released this box? Hello. Technology has advanced light years in the last 40+ years, so this only makes sense. If you're a seasoned Beatles fan, these remasters are a must have. They're worth every penny. Maybe the best $200 I've spent on music in years. And you have to admire Paul's business accumen - economy is in the toilet, so what does he do - releases the entire catalougue remastered and puts the Beatles brand on a video game, which by the way, is a great game. He's always found ways to keep minting cash and continues to introduce the greatest music ever recorded to new generations of fans. Cheers.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I've been a big PT fan since IN ABSENTIA. The novelty of a 55-minute long concept album is enough to earn my applause and endearment. The Incident is not as inspiring as FEAR OF A BLANK PLANET, which is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion. THE INCIDENT is more of a return to the sound and lyrical composition of STUPID DREAM, albeit with crunchier guitar riffs and more aggressive pacing. If you're a fan of PT, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />With the exception of the first two tracks on \\"side B,\\" there's not a dull moment on the entire album. \\"The Blind House\\" and \\"Octane Twisted\\" are the heaviest tracks on the album. But \\"Drawing the Line\\" is the highlight, mostly because the lyrics are sung with such sincerity and it's pretty catchy. \\"The Yellow Windows of the Evening Train\\" is interesting--it made me think of watching old home movies. I found the much heralded \\"Time Flies\\" a weak version of \\"Anesthetize,\\" but still a good song. \\"I Drive the Hearse\\" is a strong, emotional closer.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I looked at similar stroller organizers/cup holders for three times the price and I'm glad I went with this one.  It definitely gets the job done and you can't beat the price.  I was concerned that it wouldn't be strong enough to hold everything, but it is quite sturdy.  Also, there is a small zippered pocked in the main open console area, so you can put money or keys there if you are worried about them being out in the open.  It fits great on our baby jogger city mini - I highly recommend this product.

B00003CXSP|5.0|The long-anticipated sequel to the Academy Award winning suspense thriller \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" is here...and it's a well-crafted story. I have not read the novels, so I can't compare them. The reviews I read (mostly from newspapers and Christian websites) said that this was a really gory movie, so I was expecting that. I was a trifle disappointed that there really wasn't very much blood (and that a pivotal flashback sequence was barely visible, though the audience gets the idea from the blurred images in the scene). That's my only complaint. Oh, yes...why were there scenes in the trailer that were deleted from the film? Really stupid practice, that is. Excellent movie.

1416550542|5.0|I enjoyed The House at Riverton and couldn't wait to read The Forgotten Garden. Both novels were difficult to put down. I couldn't wait to \\"escape\\" back into the world of Nell and her grandaughter to discover the answers to the questions she searched to find. A fun read for pleasure, akin to a grownup fairytale.  Thank you Kate Morton!
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book Infidel includes a wonderful story of a woman that comes from the most meager and tortured circumstances, yet has become one of the most influential outspoken voices against injustice due to barbaric religion.<br /><br />This book is a thoroughly enjoyable book that tells her story from the beginning, the best she can remember, and takes the reader all the way to recent events. Her story of persecution and the murder of Theo Van Gogh are important events that should be studied by modern readers, and discussed by those interested in Islamic reform.<br /><br />It is important to realize that if not for the Enlightenment and the fathers of it, such as Spinoza and Voltaire, Christianity in the West would be just as barbaric as Islam, and indeed it was before that time -- in fact, it still is in many third-world countries, where people are still tried as witches and executed. Secular criticism of violence and injustice in religion is more necessary than many will admit.<br /><br />Let this book be a lesson not just to Muslims, but to Christians with historical perspective, as well.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I don't have a lot to add to the incredible reviews of this album. I just saw them live and was really impressed by the musicianship, performance and songwriting. This is the best prog rock band not only now but in the top 5 of all time. They are that good. The Incident could be their best album. \\"Time Flies\\" is possibly their best song (very Pink Floyd esque from the Animals era). I love \\"I Drive the Hearse\\" too. Steven Wilson is not only a genius in my mind but in Robert Fripp's too. He is having him reengineer the Crimson albums in Dolby 5.1 and is a fan. Blackfield, his collaboration with Aviv Geffen is noteworthy too.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Some people complained about how the joints on it are too tight, but that's silly because the joints' tightness is adjustable. It takes using a tool (that is provided with the mount) to tighten or loosen whatever joints are necessary.     I use an AOC 2230 something or other monitor (22 inches, 11 lbs i think). It works perfectly. The color doesn't perfectly match my black monitor, but....I don't care.    There was no assembly required. It came completely assembled. Admittedly, I did have to take the edge-mount off because I'm using the grommet, but that wasn't very hard.    There are rubber/foamish pads at the bottom of either mount where the stand touches the desk. These provide a great buffer between the mount and desk so that wood won't scratch, the mount will stay put, etc.    I've never used any other mount of comparable complexity, but this is exactly what I wanted.    bravo!
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Whitney Houston's voice mesmerized me when I was much younger back in the mid-eighties; and she continues to blow me away with her talent for singing far, far better than the run-of-the-mill songbird. Sure, her vocal range has changed over the years but the energy in her voice has never faded; it remains as sparkling today as it ever did and every tune on this album proves it! The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent; and I love that artwork, too.<br /><br />The track set starts with a fantastic ballad from \\"The Bodyguard\\" written by Dolly Parton, \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" Whitney aces this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing; but of course we know it really wasn't all that simple--Whitney's talent carries her through. I love it! \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" was the very first Whitney Houston tune I ever heard; Whitney sounds terrific and the music that plays fits in perfectly with Whitney's vocals. In addition, a particular favorite of mine, one that always touches me deeply, is \\"The Greatest Love of All.\\" \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" charms me now as it did then with its natural beauty; and Whitney does this better than just about any other singer ever could.<br /><br />\\"One Moment in Time\\" is very well done indeed; and there's yet another gem in \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me).\\" \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\" has enough energy to light up an entire city and Whitney belts this out like the pro she is! \\"How Will I Know\\" uses great percussion as Whitney sings this to perfection; and \\"So Emotional\\" works as well today as it did when it Whitney first released it. Awesome!<br /><br />\\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" has a very spirited arrangement; and \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\" features Whitney's full vocal range. She never skips a beat, either! \\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\\" is another fine tune that leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good. \\"If I Told You That\\" has some mighty fine key and tempo changes that Whitney handles faultlessly; and \\"I Have Nothing\\" is yet another powerful ballad in Whitney's capable hands. \\"I'm Every Woman\\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined and the CD ends well with Whitney Houston performing \\"My Love Is Your Love.\\"<br /><br />Whitney Houston has brought happiness to millions of people worldwide with her exceptional talent for singing and more; this is a must-have for her fans. It also makes a fine starter CD for people just getting into Whitney Houston. Sure, it may leave out a song or two that you may have wanted; but, then again, since when is any one Whitney Houston CD enough to be a full sized compilation of everything she's done so well?<br /><br />Thank you, Whitney!ave Nothing\\" is yet another powerful ballad in Whitney's capable hands. \\"I'm Every Woman\\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined and the CD ends well with Whitney Houston performing \\"My Love Is Your Love.\\"    Whitney Houston has brought happiness to millions of people worldwide with her exceptional talent for singing and more; this is a must-have for her fans.

0385504225|1.0|Th whole plot of this book sounds like it was lifted right from the movie National Treasure, which itself was a silly b movie!!!  I don't get what all the fuss is about over Dan Brown, his writing is far from great and his plots are very silly and his villians turn into paper tigers everytime. Why the hype??
0439023483|5.0|I read this book after my teenage daughter raved about it. I was a bit skeptical, but by the end of the first page was completely hooked. This book is by no means simply for the \\"young adult\\" market, and those readers who have steered clear of the book for that reason are making a huge mistake. This is an exceptional book that tells a great and harrowing tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the very last sentence.
B0000026WD|5.0|Shipping was fast, and the cd was amazing. It is still remastered and not the original. Just an fyi
0385504225|2.0|I was anticipating the release of the book having read his others.  It follows a similar theme with symbolism, the Masons, etc.  There was enough action to keep it interesting, but after a while, I found myself just wanting it to be over sooner.  Overall disappointed, hoping for something a little fresher.
0679882820|5.0|My 1 year old son likes this book as he already knows the sounds that various animals make.  Everytime, we read this book, I ask him what the specific animal says and he makes the sound. It is a short, easy and interactive book.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic!  Maybe the ones giving it 1 star should go back to watching Goonies!
0757302661|3.0|There are some concepts in this book I wholeheartedly agree with, and others I that I think are misguided. I haven't yet given birth myself (still two months away) but I have read at least 10 books on birthing by now and, based on that knowledge, can see that some of the information in this book can be helpful, and some misleading.    I DEFINITELY agree with the author's discussion of the mind-body connection; a positive attitude can definitely affect birth performance, and expectant mothers should imagine themselves having a successful birth experience, and surround themselves with people who will help them visualize that positive outsome. I also think that her reforming of birth language is an idea that may help women to visualize a more positive birth experience (such as using \\"baby\\" instead of \\"fetus,\\" and \\"surge\\" instead of \\"contraction\\").     I also agree that staying as calm and relaxed as possible is the key to having a less painful birth. Tense muscles, stress, and fear can work against the body's natural processes; we must strive to trust our body and the birth process, and learn to let our body \\"do its thing\\" while in labor. Some techniques in this book, such as soft music, massage, yogic breathing, and warm baths have been mentioned in several books I've read and I believe that they can be effective if reducing tension in many women (and therefore creating an easier birth). Some of the visualization techniques suggested seem kind of hokie to me (like imagining yourself floating on a \\"strawberry cloud,\\" or that your uterine muscles are flowing \\"blue satin ribbons\\"), but I'm sure that kind of visualizations work for some people.     Howver, while I agree with the above aspects of the Mongan Method, I think it is detrimental for her to suggest that EVERYONE can achieve a completely pain-free birth by using her methods. The fact that no other book I have read supports such an outlandish claim makes me skeptical of the idea. I do think that pain can be greatly reduced by using some of Mongan's methods, but whether or not they will completely eliminate pain depends on the woman and her body.    I definitely do NOT agree with the \\"Breathing the Baby Down\\" method of birthing the baby. She claims in her book that the \\"urge to push\\" is a completely conditioned response and does not actually exist. That seems like complete crap to me since the urge to push during the pushing stage is discussed at length in every other book I've read without doubt or discredit (save a mention that some women feel more of an urge than others).The rest of Mongan's book encourages you to listen to your body's signals telling you what to do; why should your urge to push be any different? If you feel like pushing, then for goodness sakes push! I don't think that \\"forced pushing\\" (the nurse/doctor telling you to push when you don't feel the urge) is a good idea, but pushing when you feel the irresistible urge to push is a good and natural responce, I believe.     So, while I'm definitely glad I read this book, I would be concerned for those who do not read any other books, since in my mind they are getting a skewed and somewhat incorrect version of the birthing process. Some other books I would recommend are \\"Ina May's Guide to Childbirth\\" and \\"The Birth Book\\" by Dr. Sears.
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|I am a huge Beatles fan but this release is nothing special, I did an A-B test with the 1987 release and the only difference I can tell is they boosted the bass. The video accessed on any computer is located in the Data folder and is in MOV format so you need Quicktime to view it, I was disappointed that the video wasn't longer and more in depth. I also prefer jewel cases to digipak, jewel cases work better in my CD rack and if it breaks I can buy a new one.  To sum up: if you have the 1987 release then don't bother with the remaster.
1416562605|5.0|Read the book and it was entertaining as well as an eye opener. This is not fiction but Facts. This is how the ordinary man in India lives and not necessarily die like Balram but like his brother Kishan.  India is full of corruption and there is no Law & order. In my state, Kerala, the thugs are ruling the state and gangs/mafia is controlling the human lives. For some reason, the people are in the rooster coop and won't react at all !!
B002C6A6F4|4.0|This movie was really cute- and a very family friendly one to boot! I watched it with my 3 year old daughter and 6 year old son- all 3 of us truly enjoyed it and were humming tunes for a while afterwards.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for all families with daughters between ages 3-13...
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|a candid evoking look at the pain of loss and how evn though we dont want  it to, damn it, time does heal all wounds. despite our efforts to make that pain our home, to live where we cant be demanded to LIVE.  Of how the snowball keeps rolling, catching us up in the layers in its inevitable course. Not usually ending up where we ever thought it would. kudos, mr. tropper
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Well, I won't go into a lengthy review since others have done a nice job already, but I'll say that Jimmy Smits is a pleasure to watch, and the season is wonderful!    My favorite scenes are, while trying to avoid spoilers:    1. Dexter watching Miguel  2. Dexter talking w/ Ramon in jail  3. Dexter arriving at the bachelor party  4. Dexter talking w/ the skinner    Awesome writing, excellent acting, damn I wish I could cyro-freeze myself so I could watch the next season on DVD tomorrow
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love this movie. It came reasonably quick and in perfect condition. This movie is highly recommended!!

B0021L8UQ2|5.0|It is very difficult to form any objective impression of this film's quality by reading reviews because opinion is so divided. Some reviewers call it a highly skilled work while others deride it. In particular, it is the stunning plot twist with about 15 minutes left that split opinion.    Before I watched it, the divisiveness and controversy intrigued me, together with the whole premise of inviting an evil female child into your home.    My review seeks to bring some \\"objectivity\\" into the discussion.    Nine-year old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is adopted by Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), a couple who are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their third child, who was stillborn. Their first two children are still very young, and they look to adopt another child in search of healing, not only for the loss of their child, but for a rift in their marriage.    Esther charms them at the orphanage, and they fall in love with her. After they take her home, there are increasing signs that \\"there's something wrong with Esther\\". She moves about strangely at night and displays a shocking vindictiveness towards other children. Layer after layer of her mysterious past is expertly unravelled by the film's makers as violent act by violent act plays itself out, culminating in the most stunning revelation near the end.     In order to enjoy this film, you must be open-minded and imaginative. You must be willing to suspend your disbelief more than usual in a work of fiction. Some things in this film will stretch your belief to the limit, but if you're open-minded and remind yourself that this world can be bizarre and confounding, you will better enjoy the intense, wicked ride this movie takes you on.    What did I love about the film? Firstly, the character of Esther is distinctly different from the evil figure in other horror films; she is a more human character than, say, the Antichrist in 'Omen'. This film is a psychological, not supernatural, horror and Esther actually draws some sympathy for being victimised at school for being \\"different\\". Many of us are familiar with this feeling. The film portrays Esther as a deeply disturbed, yet gifted, person wrestling fiercely with her demons, and makes it deeply challenging for the viewer to judge her as merely \\"evil\\". Many in the audience even relate to her, which makes 'Orphan' that much more intriguing and a moral challenge.     The film is more likely to interest you if you have an interest in psychology, including mental illness and marital relationship issues.     Secondly, it is visually stunning, incredibly artistic and compelling - a true work of art. Many of the most disturbing images are also the most creative and evocative, often even beautiful in a twisted kind of way. The director is brilliant with camera angles and movements to create a persistent, clinging sense of unease in the story.     That leads me to my third praise: it builds tension right from the start, and absolutely refuses to let up. Through camera movements that constantly create a sinister feeling, through music that ever so subtly creeps under your skin, through a succession of troubling omens leading up to Esther's adoption, the film's creators keep you on the edge from start to finish, which is what a horror film should do but very few actually manage to.    Isabelle Fuhrman puts in a riveting performance as Esther. Farmiga and Sarsgaard are also very impressive, and the issues in their marriage add to the rich psychological depth of this film. Innocent little Maxine, played by the adorable Aryana Engineer, is a brilliant foil to the malevolent Esther.
1600241344|5.0|This is my favorite David Baldacci title and Scott Brick's reading is superb. It is a must-hear, even after reading Split Second. The book is a page-turner and fantastic, but Brick's reading takes it beyond all expectations.  I may be a bit over-enthusiastic, but I think it deserves it. After listening to it from my local library, I borrowed the book and read it. I then purchased the book on CD so I could listen to it over again. It is one of those stories that can be revisited every year, at least it is my opinion.   And while the story is wonderful, it would not bear listening to again, had Scott Brick not been the best reader for the job. He creates voices that are distinctive and unusual for the various characters. Listen and enjoy.  Janet Morgan

B0021L8UXU|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge zombie fan. Whether they're Romero's slow-moving shamblers or the fast-moving runners from Return of the Living Dead / [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]], I will give any zombie movie a try. Enter Zombieland, which when I heard about it, I instantly thought of that direct-to-DVD drivel you see on the rental store shelf that can barely pass as a B-movie. After watching the trailer however, I was genuinely intrigued. Luckily, my friend managed to get her hands on a few preview passes and what I saw was one of the most fun and enjoyable movies I've seen in years.    I'll say it now: This movie is NOT scary. If you go in expecting scares and frights, you're in the wrong place. While there's the occasional \\"boo\\" scare, Zombieland is a horror-comedy in the vein of [[ASIN:6305841861 Evil Dead II]], [[ASIN:B000RPCK2Y The Return of the Living Dead]], [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]], etc. As a matter of fact, the director was inspired by Shaun of the Dead to make Zombieland. The horror-comedy mixture is is a very hard thing to pull off, but this movie does it pretty well, leaning more towards the comedy.    The cast is great, with Woody Harrelson being the stand out. He is such a great tough guy and delivers some truly great one-liners that it brings back memories of his [[ASIN:B002AF4Y9G Natural Born Killers]] days. Jesse Eisenberg is the \\"goofy dorky guy\\" that keeps popping up in movies these days. He does a good job, but is nearly indistinguishable from someone like Michael Cera, who plays the exact same role every time. I liked this guy better because frankly I'm sick of seeing Michael Cera these days. Emma Stone (aka Jules from Superbad) plays a good tough girl and looks exactly like she did in Superbad, which isn't a bad thing. Abigail Breslin is fine, but she felt slightly out of place. There's also a bigger-than-a-cameo role by one of the funniest actors of all-time, but I don't want to spoil it here. Trust me, it's hysterical.    That's about it for the cast, except for the zombies themselves, which are very well done. They're gross, gooey, and vicious and the make-up and special effects look fantastic, especially now in the age of CGI crap. The movie does not skimp on the gore, so be prepared for a healthy serving of blood, guts, and zombie bites. The post-apocalyptic scenery looks amazing and really pulls you into the film. Zombie fans, you will not be disappointed.    The comedy is executed quite well. While whether something is funny depends purely on personal taste (pun intended), I think this movie balances gross-out humor, sight gags, witty banter, black comedy and plain-old \\"Number 2\\" jokes perfectly. One of the funniest bits is when Woody Harrelson's character rides a roller coaster while simultaneously wielding a shotgun and shoots zombies that follow him around the track. It was clever and a blast to watch. Think of your favorite comedy; Zombieland is probably not as funny as that, but it will definitely make you laugh. It's not the funniest movie ever, but it does an admirable job.    Other than that, I can't think of anything else to say. I have minor nitpicks, but most of them are standard horror clichés that didn't really take away from my enjoyment of the film itself. Do yourself a favor and check this one out, it's a great horror-comedy.
B002BIULQ2|2.0|I had to return this copy because in the description it says it came with the Hoe Down Throw Down walk thru.  Much to my surpurse after ordering (while waiitng for it to arrive) I see a commercial that says only on Blue Ray.  So I go online and try and figure things out, which I found I had to mail this back and order the blue ray version.  I compared the two descriptions on Amaazon and they were IDENTICAL, so I fell it was a little false advertising.  I had to pay to ship it back and get a new copy.....first time I was disappointed with Amazon.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|This is an absolutely fabulous DVD.  But..............there are a few videos missing that we ALL love and really were hoping to see.  Especially these 2:  You Must Love Me  American Life (original version)    If these videos were included, I'd give 5 stars.
B001GCUO16|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I was pleased with the action and the special effects. I've always been a fan of explosions and Wolverine kicking some tail. Hugh Jackman does a great job as Wolverine, and the rest of cast was well chosen by the producers and director, I even learned that Will.I.Am is a fairly decent actor, besides a famous hip-hop star from the Black Eyed Peas. Theres just a few things I had a problem with in this movie. For starters, as with most prequels/sequels, the 'cheesy factor' was fairly high in this feature. I don't understand why it nearly always has to be that way in the acting and script. I've seen a lot of really great prequels/sequels and a lot of terrible ones, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. Also, I didn't care for the plot twist at the end, when Ryan Reynolds' character, Deadpool became some freak of a mutant. I like the idea of the scientists making him into a weapon, but the special effects and make-up they used in those scenes received another high mark on my 'cheesy factor' scale. They should have spent a little more time making him look tougher and deadlier. He just didn't do it for me on the intimidation factor. As much money as it costs these days to make a movie, one would think they would spend a little more money and time on the make-up and finer details of things like this. But, I do have to give this movie a little bit of credit, they did tell a pretty good back story of Wolverine's past and where he came from and how he came to be amongst the X-Men. But my only problem I don't think I'll buy this movie any time soon, its still too much to spend on a sub-par movie that is missing a few key elements to make it a real summer blockbuster.
0061730327|5.0|This book is being billed as an upbeat story about a 14 year old boy building a windmill to bring electricity to his village.<br />That is only part of the truth.  This book is also a detailed story about growing up in a culture very different from our own<br />and a hard, unflinching look at the devastating effects of famine and parasitic government on that culture.  Mr. Kamkwamba<br />gives us a portrait of time, place, people that is reminiscent of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", quietly stunning in its beauty, chilling<br />in its depiction of the worst in human nature and breathtakingly uplifting in its depiction of the mind and spirit triumphing<br />over adversity.<br />Its also an interesting and compelling cautionary tale, a book to be reckoned with!<br />Highly recommended!
055358894X|5.0|Truly a great book. This book really just didn't let up for the most part. I liked the first 3/4 of it the most but it was enjoyable throughout. I didn't even really like the main character as a person, he's a thief, but the book just throws so many cool ideas at you and it's so quirky and fun that it didn't really matter to me. The writing is fun and there were a few laugh out loud moments for me. Most books that you read you're lucky to remember the title the month after you finish it but this book had some lines in it that I just don't see myself forgetting any time soon they were so amusing. \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is not an in depth case study of the human condition or any of that crap that some people like to read about, but if you can tolerate some bad language, and a at times less than heroic main character than this book really should be a fun time for most readers.
0385504225|1.0|Boring...    It's the less I can say about this book. I purchased the book on Tuesday. I gave up on Thursday. I couldn't finish it. I'll donate it to my local library. I'm not interested in what the secret is or what the symbol represents.     One doesn't expect a literally masterpiece by Dan Brown. He declared that he gave up trying to write serious literature long time ago. But, come on, with all the money he has, he could have paid somebody to polish his style. Most chapters have a flashback; the book is full of \\"Oh, my God\\" in italics; all the characters think in italics; and all \\"important\\" information is in italics, each in a new line. I understand Mr. Brown doesn't want to bother his readers with such stuff as stream of consciousness, but the result was that each time I read something in italics I wanted to throw the book. He treats his readers as mental handicap persons.     As for the plot, I don't expect a novel, something that for definition is fiction, to be accurate in all details. But, again, the absurdity of the story is just too much.  Even Kafka would have found this book totally nonsense. The most exciting scenes are people staring at computer screens or at cell phones looking for information on the internet. I read somewhere that google is making people more stupid. I'll add: especially some novelists. Of course, there are the required explosion, the murder, the murdered, the chasing, etc, all the stuff found in the average thriller, but this obsession to fix actual \\"facts\\" in a story, just make it unbelievable. All the characters are cartoon-like, stereotypes. The villain, for example, is a eunuch! Mr. Brown seems to have a fascination with physical malformation and thinks that evil is attached with it. I wonder why novelists don't make their villains \\"normal\\" clean-cut, Wall Street executives, who leave countries bankrupt.      Of course, the \\"science\\" is all mumbo-jombo. The so called \\"quantum effect\\" in our brains has been refuted by all respected scientists until exhaustion. Read, for example, \\"Quantum Gods\\". Only, Oprah's fans, the ones that find \\"The Secret\\" inspiring will find that something important is said here.     Please, don't waste your money and your time reading this. Maybe, the obligatory upcoming movie will make some sense of this spaghetti thriller.  At least, Tom Hanks is a likable character.
0307341550|5.0|Wow what an amazing book. It was full of twists and turns and what struck me as interesting is the main character is as messed up as the bad guy is. The story deals with cutting, Munchausen's, alcohol abuse, jealousies, family dysfunctions, among other afflictions through out. But in the mist of all of the crud going on there is a great mystery to solve and Gillian told the story wonderfully.<br /><br />The book pulled me in quickly and didn't let me off until the last page. All in all I would have to give this two thumbs up and I look forward to reading her newest novel soon.
B00006F7S4|4.0|One of the best beginning-to-end albums I own.  It is an amazingly cohesive effort.  Beck went through some heavy stuff at this time in his life and he deals with it all here.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|It has it's moments. The songs are a little more pop than what we would ever expect from Muse and a few of the lyrics are uncomfortably sappy. \\"Love is our resistance\\"???? (cringe) But this is album is definitely worth owning if only for Exogenesis. It really is something special. Gorgeous.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|I first saw this film at the Theatre about 14 years ago. It has lost none of its \\"appeal\\" over time. Kyle Maclaghlin gives a particularly \\"wooden\\" performance, following his success in \\"Twin Peaks\\"!! ... and before \\"Desperate Housewives\\"??!!
1416511946|5.0|A great read, very well paced, very interesting. Not just what's going on in the real world, that almost takes a back seat to the ride going on in Nikki's own brain.    What an interesting tale, I've never been a Motley fan but this makes me want to be one. You really start to get the feeling like you know Nikki Sixx from reading this. Where he's coming from, what he's going through and like you kicked back and hung out at a few crazy parties with him.    Aside from that, I know it's been mentioned, but the format of the book itself is very entertaining. The colors splice back and forth between whites, blacks and reds. Intermixed with pictures of both real people and crazed drawings.    A lot of people would enjoy this book but it's an especially good read for a Motley fan, metal fan or drug fan.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Here we go again, but with fewer adjectives. The Da Vinci Code seemed to substitute adjectives for description, a weakness which seems to be more restrained this time.  This reminded me of junk food. Much more quantity than quality, hard to stop gorging on it, but ultimately not satisfying.  It is likely that this will be more of a hit inside America than in the rest of the world. This contains great dollops of the civic religion which the rest of the world looks at wryly. America the hope of the world, America the great exception.   Washington is an imperial city, modelled on Rome and sometimes as brutal in its imperialism. If you live outside the boundaries of the inner empire, somewhere outside the United States, the shining symbols seem rather more tarnished.
B00004R9A4|5.0|DVD is GREAT, love the movie, transfer is very good, plus it's Anamorphic WS (1.66). Color is good just the way I remember it at the theater.    The one thing I did notice is right after the credits Sam Jaffe says a little bit then further production credits roll. Right at the begining it states Bedknobs and Broomsticks - 25th Anniversary Edition and NOT 30th.    Very happy with the DVD, highly recommend it any family !!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is, without doubt, a must own set for anyone who appreciates our Mother Earth.  Simply takes your breath away over and over.

B002K0WBXW|2.0|This is the quintessential chick flick.  The primary roles are female.  No big deal.  The same was mostly true of \\"A League of Their Own.\\"  But, what's missing here is anything resembling a male with much testosterone.  In addition, the character development and especially the shift in feelings between Bullock and Reynolds is lacking.  For women looking for something to watch on a Saturday night \\"The Proposal\\" might fit the bill.  On the other hand, this movie brings to bare the lyrics to the ballad \\"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone.\\"  As a guy, my only excuse for watching this movie is that my girlfriend really wanted to see it so I went along with her.  That takes care of the chick flicks for a while.
0316168815|1.0|I have heard this is an excellant book... I wouldn't know due to the seller taking my money and not sending me my book. NOR have they bothered to contact me to return my money or let me know where the book I purchased is. I will no longer use the used book sellers.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I got around to watching Slumdog Millionaire rather late, having first thought that the Academy was just being kind to Bollywood in a slow year. I was wrong. Slumdog Millionaire is a very well done movie and deserved the Oscar for best picture and cinematography. Throughout the movie you are never really sure whether he is going to get the girl or the money. Both are certainly worth having.<br /><br />Be aware that this movie is rated R for a reason. The main character is tortured by the police, his mother is killed during a violent rampage against Muslims, his brother becomes an assassin at an early age, and a ruthless organized crime gang intentionally blinds a young boy.<br /><br />Slumdog is much more edgy than old school Bollywood films like Asoka or Lagaan. It also has better editing. It is not a romantic comedy like Bachna Ae Haseeno. There are no interspersed song and dance numbers throughout the movie. Slumdog has more action and graphic violence than Monsoon Wedding. But it's not quite as deep as Water. The original language is mostly English (not dubbed), so there is no need to read subtitles.
0385340990|3.0|I don't know if I have much to offer after over 800 reviews.  However, I believe the 4.5-star average rating is too high, so I'm offering my two cents.  This is a sweet, simple story with sweet, simple characters -- a feel-good novel that is great for a rainy day (and will probably become a nice chick flick someday).  If you're looking for something to really sink your teeth into, then skip the potato peel pie.<br /><br />What I liked about the book:  witty writing; epistolary format (I didn't have any problem \\"following\\" the book); the main character, Juliet; learning about the Channel Islands, in general, and the German occupation of them, in particular; the first half of the story.<br /><br />What I disliked:  many of the characters lacked depth (particularly Dawsey -- I really would have liked to get to know him better -- was he supposed to be enigmatic and proud like Austen's Darcy?); the story fizzled and lost credibility in the second half; the voices of characters were nearly indistinguishable (all were similarly eloquent and witty writers); the predictable and abrupt ending; how incredulously quickly the letters traveled (a minor distraction at first -- after awhile I just stopped looking at dates!).
0316044695|2.0|I'm a former Army officer.  Marcus Luttrell and the men of his seal team are genuine American heroes.  Nevertheless, this book leaves a lot to be desired.  The co-author blatantly uses hyperbole to describe seal training, elements of the battle, descriptors of the individuals involved in the mission, etc.  Frankly, the book has too many words when a matter-of-fact approach would allow the courage and bravery of the seals to come through more genuinely.  Seal training is hard, harder than standard military training.  Drugstore soldiers/sailors will get a kick out of the details of this training.  Men who've been there and done that will find it at best excessive and at worst demeaned by the he's-one-tough-sob clichés.    Finally, there is the sad fact of the mission itself.  Hindsight is 20/20.  Still, one can reasonably question both the strategy and the tactics employed yet such questions are not raised.  Instead we get a lot of these-guys-would-do-anything-for-their-brothers sort of stuff.  Communication was a mess -- and costly.  Contingency planning appears to have been nil. Reinforcements were not prepared or properly staged.  The list goes on.  Simply put, the heroism of the individuals involved is only part of the story.  Whoever put this mission together should have been run out of the service.  For better or worse, these issues are not discussed.    A friend of mine, a former Naval officer and USNA grad told me he thought the hyperbole and lack of military discussion of the engagement was likely due to the fact that Navy brass gave Luttrell a lot of assistance in writing his story but the quid pro quo was a lack of criticism of the use of seals in this mission.  Maybe that's so, but serious military students would do well to compare this book with \\"We Were Soldiers Once -- And Young\\".  The latter captures the heroism far better and in a lot of ways does justice to the participants by being understated and to the point.  Again, this is not to take away fromwhat these individuals did, but the book needs work.
B001T9O6X8|5.0|===Complements current moment awareness books perfectly, not just Tolle's.<br />Jill Bolte Taylor was a driven Harvard neuroanatomist when she suffered a stroke. She describes the stroke in amazing detail, indicating which parts of her brain were impacted and how that manifested itself in her behavior (or inability to act/react). She goes on to describe her rehabilitation process, which took eight years to complete, and how she changed from a driven left-brained scientist to a peaceful whole-brained (allowing much more input from the right than previous) person. If you have suffered a stroke, know someone who has, or even if you just wonder about the differences between the left and right parts of the brain, this book is for you. I would also recommend it for anyone who has read and enjoyed books from the \\"focus on the now\\" philosophy espoused by many Buddhist teachers and Eckhart Tolle, among others, as it adds a layer of scientific information to the spiritual dimension of current moment awareness.
0385340575|3.0|Starts well and is better than previous book but not one of the better Reachers
1416955070|3.0|I read it and the cliffhanger made me get the other two books. The other two books were so much better. I recommend this book only as a pathway to the other great books in the series. City of Bones didn't fully enthrall me into its world. I think there was too much going on--too much background information. This book sets up the story and I think the next two books actually tells the story. I'm very glad I stuck with this series after I found the first one sort of boring. If you start reading it, just remember: it gets better!
B001H9MWW2|5.0|This CD is awsome!!! Love Prospekt's March it was a wonderful surprise. I thought from the other reviews that it was just a tweaked duplicate of Viva la Vida, but it is has its own sound in so many ways. I love them both and have listened to them everyday since I got them.

0345455681|5.0|Edward Rutherfurd writes history the way today's reader can understand and love. His books like London and Sarum are stories of \\"real\\" people living in an actual time line. He also breaks up each long chapter into little segments that can be read over a quick cup of coffee, while waiting for the doctor, or even just before bed when you want to read for about five minutes.
0439023491|2.0|The wait made my anticipation great and maybe my expectations too great. I had hoped for something...I don't know different. There was so many things that disappointed me. For starters, the book often summarized events instead of actually showing them. I also didn't like how the book went back to the same plot of the first book with Katniss in the hunger games again. When I first read Hunger Games, the games were new and exciting to read but in this one, I already knew what to expect in terms of the games so I was more bored than enthralled. It also took over 200 pages for the hunger games to come back and cause havoc for Katniss. I think I was hoping for a different plot--something more original and imaginative than just a repeat of the first. I hope the third books is much better.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|When I heard that Whitney had a new album coming out, I was very happy and almost bought it without hearing it first.  But just before I hit that \\"Place Order\\" button, I had second thoughts.  So I came here to read the reviews and was so glad I hadn't purchased it.  So many one star reviews, and people saying that Whitney's voice was gone, she was washed up, etc.  I was never a die-hard Whitney fan, but I have loved some of her songs and have always thought she had the best voice I'd ever heard.  So after reading the reviews I changed my mind and went on about my business.  But her story is so touching and her comeback so inspirational that I decided to listen to her cd on the internet.  And after doing so, I have to say, I don't understand the one-star and two-star reviews.  This is, at worst, a good comeback album.  But more than that, I thought it sounded like the old Whitney, but one that has matured and grown and come through a lot to tell her story.  There aren't a lot of ballads, which Whitney is known for, but this is where Whitney is in her life and this is her story.  I respect that and I really like the album.  It's the old Whitney, but seasoned and updated.  And her voice sounds just fine--a little worn for the wear, but fine.  She still has one of the best voices out there.  I'm happy for her and about to place my order.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|That's right, I don't understand why Metallica are considered God's and Megadeth are considered good. I mean, you tell me, which band has continually put out quality material over the years, especially the past 20? It's not the God's, I can tell you that. Megadeth or shall I say Dave, has always stayed true to his roots and has been able to hit more than miss during the last 20 years. Infact, I'd say 95% of the time he has indeed given us a quality product just like a Callahan oil filter (Tommy Boy refrence for those who have no ideas what the hell I'm talking about). This latest release is once again, light years ahead of anything Metallica has put out (althought Death Magnetic was a step in the right direction) over the last two decades.<br /><br />This release harkens back to the early days of the band. It melodic and thrashy as hell, yet groovy and soulful. The darn thing flat out rocks from start to finish. They say it's hard to go back and I can relate to that, however Megadeth have done just that. It's old school speed metal and it kicks serious butt all the way through. If you love Megadeth like I do?, you'll love this cd. Dave proves once again, that he was Metallica!<br /><br />Buy it!!!

B002BSHXJA|1.0|Of course we want to hear the mono versions. They orignally were only going to make 10,000 copies. It sold out, so they ordered up another 20,000 made. What is this? The Thatcher/Reagan/Bush approach to music? They know we want them, so they hold them back and gouge us. And when they want to make more $ they print up another 20,000. Hey, why not just sell them individually and make enough to go around. Sorry guys, I won't be buying this. Can't afford it. I won't buy the stereo ones either because of this. I will continue to get my Beatles out of the public library and dub them on cassette. Cripes. These are people with all the money in world trying to take advantage of the people who pay them all that money.  - (2/5/11) well, thanks to either the downloaders or all the complaining, this set is now easliy available and at an affordable price. It is a really great set. I will leave up my original review to just let everyone know there is no reason to issue just a few at a high price. I would like to see them issued as single disks available all the time....nice job!! Oh by the, sad there seems to be counterfit copies about, but what do you expect if you keep the stuff from people?

B0015ABRE2|5.0|As expected, the 3rd season of Dexter is fantastic. The characters are really developing and coming to life. Dexter is a likable character and despite the fact that he's a serial killer, you can't help but feel he is doing society justice. Even more on the edge of your seat plots in season 3. Definately worth the purchase!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|You had to have this third novel to complete the trilogy for Hollywood to produce. It was an okay read, but I spotted the plot twist the minute it was introduced (when the background of the antagonist is introduced). I felt it borrowed from another famous novel by an author with the initials A.D., but twists that plot in the only other way you really can. Dan Brown has developed a captivating style which I think has now been fully explored and won't work again. I would even have to agree with most that it barely worked this time. If this novel had come out before The DaVinci Code, it would have been better as this novel will NOT generate the same level of controversy. I would agree it's better than Angels & Demons, but below DaVinci Code. I'll also agree I'm glad I only bought the Kindle version (Thanks for letting me borrow yours, Dwayne!). Guess it'll be in theaters at the end of 2010. In the end the movie trilogy will be just like The Matrix, starts off with the best idea and just goes downhill from there.
B002K8BLSA|5.0|This is a work of genius by the greatest songwriter of his generation, Paddy McAloon. These songs are beautifully melodic, with intelligent, penetrating lyrics sung by a man whose phrasing rivals that of Sinatra. \\"Here comes the last of the great romantics/Not tortured/Not racked/Illusions intact... undiscouraged by the facts...\\" This is music as it should be  - inspirational, instructive, full of humor and wit. This is music that is life affirming. Buy this CD, let it enrich your life, and share it with your friends.
B001992NUQ|5.0|A lot of people didn't \\"get\\" Fight Club when they first saw it.  I suggested they watch it again.  Most of the people \\"got it\\" the second time, and they realized why they didn't \\"get it\\" the first time:  they were trying too hard.    There are a lot of layers to this movie, to be sure, and if you watch it several times, you'll probably still find new things to appreciate about it the next time.  If you just didn't like it, well...  I don't know what to tell you.    I'm not gonna give too much away here.  If you've seen it, you know this is a movie ripe with spoiler possibilities.  If you haven't, suffice it to say it's one man's take on society, personal identity, individuality, the catharsis of self-destruction...  and for those of you who didn't quite \\"get it\\":  this is not an action movie...  or a drama...  or a psychological puzzle.  This movie is a comedy.  A thick, sludgy, DAAAARRRRRK comedy... but if you're into that sorta thing, it's absolutely hilarious and brilliant.  Ed Norton plays the films single, 30-year-old career man, who's dull, structured lifestyle has bored him into a severe case of insomnia.  He finds relief in the emotional outbursts that he participates in by attending group therapy for illnesses and afflictions he doesn't actually have.  When another \\"faker\\", a quirkily depressing Helena Bonham Carter, throws him off his groove, his insomnia returns, but now he is strangely obsessed with her.  Enter Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, a cynical, anti-conformist soap-salesman with a penchant for anarchic practical jokes at his many part-time jobs.  Norton and Pitt become roommates, and soon start Fight Club, a new support group where men meet, beat the crap out of each other, and find that hitting rock bottom gives you a whole new perspective on life.  Where it all goes from there is a mind-bending and hilariously twisted journey.    As for the Blu-Ray edition I can only say \\"GET IT\\".  It's cheap, it looks and sounds amazing compared to DVD editions.Not a whole lot of \\"new\\" extras, but it's worth it for the tech-upgrade (and the amusing new menus).

B000002LEU|5.0|'Substance' was my introduction to Joy Division, and unlike some reviewers below, I think it's actually the best place to start for new fans. The studio albums capture the band at particular points in time, but this collection is more complete because it covers the band's entire career.     It's important to note that this is not a \\"Greatest Hits\\" type release or a replacement for the studio albums. Only 'She's Lost Control' appears from the albums, and even then in a different mix. 'Substance' is instead a collection of Joy Division's non-album tracks, including the entire 'Ideal for Living' EP and all of the band's singles. All of the well-known Joy Division songs are here, including 'Transmission', 'She's Lost Control', 'Dead Souls', 'Atmosphere' and of course 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', but there are also rare singles such as 'Digital' and 'Autosuggestion'. The latter in particular is a lost classic, building up slowly over five minutes before exploding with energy at the very end. Several B-sides are included as well, and again there are some real hidden gems here; the almost funky 'Glass', the restrained 'From Safety to Where', the tribal 'Komakino' and the near pop of 'These Days'.    Joy Division progressed rapidly through their short career, and 'Substance' allows us to follow their transition from the raw punk of their first songs through to their classic post-punk sound, with their final singles giving a hint of the dance/New Wave direction New Order would take. It's fascinating to note that even on early songs like 'Leaders Of Men' and 'No Love Lost', there are already signs of the dark, arty introspection that characterised their later work.     Essential for all Joy Division fans, and in its own way even more important than the two studio albums.

B00002DE4E|4.0|Much like Nirvana's 'In Utero', this album is probably doomed to be viewed forever as a \\"suicide note\\", with people scrutinising Ian Curtis' every lyric for \\"evidence\\" that he intended to take his own life. Please try to leave all that aside when listening to this album. Ian Curtis was a genius, but Joy Divison had three other members, and while the lyrics are often despairing, the most noticeable thing about 'Closer' is the increasing ambition and diversity of the music. I've always felt the instrumentalists are a bit undersold when discussing Joy Division; it's one thing to write poetic lyrics, but if every song had been a tuneless dirge, Joy Division would have worn out their welcome very quickly. The aggressive expansion of the band's sound makes 'Closer' even more interesting than 'Unknown Pleasures', although maybe slightly less consistent.      The range of influences and ideas here is extraordinary, as nearly every song branches out in a different direction. 'Atrocity Exhibition' has a tribal, Krautrock feel; 'Isolation' and 'Decades' border on synth-pop; 'Colony' is a forceful rocker, 'Heart And Soul' has an otherwordly, futuristic feel, and 'Twenty Four Hours' seems to look ten years ahead to grunge and alt-rock with its stop/start/soft/loud dynamic. Despite the dark lyrics, the music is invigorating and often danceable, with only the two closing tracks being more reflective and somber.    As good as this album is, I have two (fairly minor) criticisms of it:    Firstly, the sheer diversity of the music means the album does not fit together quite as well as 'Unknown Pleasures'. 'Closer' has some better individual songs, but 'Unknown Pleasures' is a more coherent, focussed album.    Secondly, producer Martin Hannett is not as consistent as before. He tries as many different things as the band, but they don't always come off, and at times it seems he's doing it simply because he can (a problem that would plague New Order's debut album 'Movement'). Sometimes he nails it; the nervous feel of 'Isolation', the very sparse, echoed 'Heart And Soul', the keyboard lines of 'Decades'. At other times, such as the chainsaw-guitar of 'Atrocity Exhibition' or the random hissing on 'The Eternal', he seems to detract from the songs instead of add to them. The production also robs tracks like 'A Means To An End' of some of their their power.    These minor flaws aside, Joy Division were in great form as individuals and as a band. It's a pity that the fate of Curtis too often overshadows the rapid musical development on display here.
B002AOWXO0|4.0|I've been a PY fan since his debut.  For me, he's established himself as an artist whose quality work is so consistent that I'll buy anything he releases, even unheard.  He's had a few missteps along the way, but he still manages to record songs that have me playing them over and over and over again.  When I heard about this project, I was a little skeptical about the collaboration with Johansson. I wondered if this was just some vanity indulgence for a friend of his and was doubtful it was going to be any good.  Well, what a surprise...this album (at only 29 minutes) is great! While this is Pete's album, Scarlett's presence feels just right - her singing is only featured prominently on a few tracks and is used supportingly on the rest. It's a good mix.  I have to say, judging from this album I wouldn't mind hearing more of them together. Good work, Pete!!

B002ISID10|5.0|Sorry for the caps, it's just that this CD is filled with awesomeness. I recently purchased the new Used CD, Saosin CD, and Muse CD. Since I enjoyed all of their previous albums, I have been disappointed by each one, especially the new Used CD - Artwork, since they are my favorite band.    Anyways, I thought I would try something new. After reviewing this month's AP magazine featuring Paramore, I stumbled upon this new CD Asking Alexandria, I heard a few samples on Amazon, then I decided to pick up the CD at Hot Topic.    Man...I haven't been happy with a CD purchase in months! This whole album is amazing, it's so unique, I haven't heard anyone like them.    What makes them unique is their vocals, and they add a lot of different sounds to their tracks, it's not some repetitive sound like many emo/screamo/metal bands.    For instance, their songs may have the deep demonic sounding gurgling vocals, then will jump to the scream at the top of your lungs vocals, then the song will jump into the harmonious emo soft vocals, then jump back into the screams.     They even have tracks that include a lot of techno/electronica! Techno mixed with screamo, that is an amazing combo, I love it! I wish more bands did this...on second thought...no I don't, because then other bands would just be copying Asking Alexandria, that is why they are unique.    Track 1 has an example of the techno/guitar riffs. Then track 6 is a electronic type of song; tracks 11, 12 and 13 also includes some electronica. There are probably more, I am still listening to the CD as I am typing this review!    Tracks 6,7,8,9 and 11 are my favorites. The bass hits are incredible on my 2 10\\" subs. Buy this CD now!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Out of all of the remasters, this is the one I decided to chime in about.<br />I hate to use the same old cliche' but it really is like listening to it for the first time. I'm just going to point out a few things I noticed. The Drum intro to \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" is so clear and deep that I almost looked behind me. The bass on \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For me and My Monkey and \\"Helter Skelter\\" can actually be felt in your chest. I'm giddy over these releases. As one reviewer here said that he'd like to play Frisbee with the old 80's CD's, I'd like to use them as coasters. Enjoy!
0385504225|2.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's novels, and I have to say, I'm disappointed in The Lost Symbol. It's as though he's been drinking too much of his own Kool-Aid. There are way too many references to his other books, and it seems as though Brown just didn't try too hard with this book. It reads more like a movie script, and not a very good one at that. Did he run out of ideas and then go see \\"National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets\\" to get more? And is it just me, or does anyone else see the Bellamy character being written to lure Morgan Freeman into the film version? The characters are flimsy, and why oh why does he keep saying \\"Robert Langdon\\" (using his full name) just about every time he refers to that character? And we haven't even gotten to the formulaic issue - do all of his Langdon books HAVE to have a lone, weird guy as the antagonist?    I found myself slogging through this book instead of flying through it, what with the repeated explanations of the same things (as if he's writing a high school essay and has to pad it to make it long enough) and the sometimes awkward attempts at romance between Langdon and Katherine. Overall, this is one of those books that makes you wish you could get your money back. Sad.

This is part of the author's three book indictment of Swedish society as violent and deeply ambivalent about women and their roles in society.<br /><br />The writing is brilliant, the stories compelling.. but the books contain strongly rude and hard to read scenes that are shocking and crass.  This is necessary for the depth of the depravity that is being written about, but not easy to take for the casual reader.<br /><br />All in all, a brilliant series.<br /><br />One thing to note:  In this book, and the first book, there is revenge taken by a lead character for the abuse she has suffered.  This author is brilliant; he captures both the human impulse to cheer this revenge, and the corrosive effect revenge has on the person taking the revenge... the way getting even can turn into becoming vengeful.  This is masterful writing, of depth, and yet it is not easy to accept -- perhaps why this is good writing?

0385504225|2.0|Good first half thriller,(like it was written for a movie). The end is a rambling mess. Almost like two different books.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Very interesting story for all ages. Even though it is a little scary, out very young grandchildren love it and ask to watch it over and over. It is great that it comes in all 3 current formats, so we can let them watch it in the car, or on the computer, or on any of the TV's in the house. Adults will love it too. Very Tim Burtonesque.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Typically, I dislike \\"chick flicks\\" ... some are ok, but most are mediocre at best. I was expecting another \\"27 Dresses\\" or \\"Maid of Honor\\" but \\"The Proposal\\" shocked me - it is a nice combination of \\"Dan in Real Life\\" and \\"Miss Congeniality\\". The story is well-written and usually pretty-darn funny.<br /><br /> The plot is relatively straight-forward a high-strung editor realizes that she is about to be deported to Canada. She forces her assistant to lie to immigration and state that they are soon to married. Immigration is more than a little suspicious of the arrangement, so to help convince everyone Ryan Reynolds and Bullock take a trip to Alaska to meet Reynolds family. At this point the movie actually becomes funny (If not perfectly believable). In Alaska we are introduced to a very frank grandmother, the doting ex-girlfriend, and the local stripper/clerk/waiter (played by \\"Oscar\\" of \\"The Office\\" fame).<br /><br />  I guess what I liked about \\"The Proposal\\" is that Ryan Reynolds plays a very likable character and despite the outlandish plot you get a sense of reality of family interactions.<br /><br />Things that I liked<br />  - Great setting - the location may be the star of the movie<br />  - Funnier than I would have expected<br />  - Sappy - but not TOO sappy.<br /><br />  Final Verdict, a rare \\"Chick-Flick\\" that guys won't mind seeing twice.<br /><br />5 Stars
B001FB55H6|3.0|Great special effects, Story line a little lame, though the concept was very cool. However the ending got very weird. It's a good movie to watch when the kids are not around.
0316017922|5.0|After reading Mr. Gladwell's other two books, this audio version was a perfect way for my husband and I to 'read' his third. The subject is fascinating and Gladwell's serene-voiced reading of his own material is edifying and well-done.
0739383728|4.0|Only half-way through the audiobook, but so far an interesting story. Some odd characters, but relatable. It reminds me of my freshman year of cross country where I ran the entire season barefoot. Of course, I suspect it will take more than getting rid of my expensive ASICS in order to get me feeling that youthful feeling on the road now.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Muse have done a rare thing in creating an album that combines pop listenability with true artistic risk taking that turns out to be a brilliant listening experience. This album is bold and intense with an eclectic mix of musical styles and sounds. Muse have thrown everything into this album including the best production techniques of their impressive career. This is definitely an apex in Muse's musical evolution and makes you wonder where their genius might take them in the future. There are many highlights including the infectious opening track \\"Uprising\\", the Queen-infused \\"United States of Eurasia\\" and the epic three part suite \\"Exogenesis\\". Highly recommended to discerning music listeners who want the best pop-rock has to offer.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The workout is tough but gets you \\"shredded\\".  Jillian is much more bearable than what I've seen of her on Biggest Loser.  She does flirt with her two girls in the background constantly, which is pretty annoying.    I am on day 20 and definitely noticing a difference, though without an accompanying diet there is only so much this workout will do for you.   I was 6 weeks postpartum when I started and I also have bad knees, so I definitely made use of her adjustments for those with bad joints or who are really out of shape.    This jump started me, but being postpartum I haven't put in all I could - I think I will wait another 6 weeks and do it again.  I recommend this for someone who has little time and is willing to work as hard as they can since it's only 20 minutes.

0385504225|4.0|Yes, let the battles begin between the literary snobs and the low brows who just want to be entertained. In the comments to the current first listed review, someone points out that there is a huge difference between a great writer and a great story teller. Brown is a great example of that difference. Is he the best writer in the world? No. Is anyone ever going to claim he's the next Shakespeare? Hardly.    But those literary snobs seem to forget the purpose of most fiction stories of today isn't brilliant prose. It's entertainment.  I know that what counts as entertainment is different to everyone. Dan Brown's equation for entertainment is great: emotional investment in characters, plus action that plays on that investment, plus a lot of fascinating research thrown in. I will definitely admit that there were things I didn't like. No book is perfect. The question is, do the things that annoy you detract from your entertainment enough to not read it? That answer is going to be different for everybody. For the literary snobs who can't get past that he used the phrase \\"the skull cradled in his palms\\" three times in the prologue, yeah, you're going to have a hard time. (And even some of those people enjoyed it anyway.) For those of us who don't analyze that critically when wanting to read something fun, entertaining, and somewhat informative, it will be very enjoyable.     What I liked most? It was a quick, entertaining read that also made me think. I really appreciated Dan Brown's view of the world.  His take on religion, science and history is very open-minded and different than the average person. He's a smart man. I can't give examples, I don't want to spoil anything.    Dan Brown had a tough time writing this book, you can tell. It is unbelievably hard to get all the interesting research he found in to one book without it becoming bogged down. I think he might have erred a little on the bogged down side. I felt like a little too much was thrown at me, but I also felt like it didn't have enough substance. I wanted more details of certain things, maybe less of others.     One warning for Brown fans: the beginning is a little slower than you expect from him. For pitty's sake, no one DIES in the first chapter!    Recommended? Yes. I don't think the writing is \\"bad\\" (not the best is not the same as bad) and the majority of people will enjoy it. Everyone except the literary snobs or purist hardcore academics. It just seems like those are the only people who take time to review...
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader is an impressive film. The acting was superb, the filming exquisite, and the subject matter treated in a profoundly thoughtful and honest fashion. The main fault of the film lay in its editing, which regrettably left out some of the most important explanatory scenes. (Be sure to watch the deleted scenes if you found the film choppy.) Equally as regrettable was the insertion of a secondary (and completely irrelevant) plot line revolving around Michael Berg's daughter, which only served to add confusion to a movie that was already somewhat at odds with itself. (In contrast to the book, which was crystal clear.)<br /><br />The plot is fairly straightforward. A young man, Michael, falls ill in an alley. An older woman, Hanna, encounters him, and after cleaning him up and giving him a mysteriously compassionate hug, she accompanies him to his home. After Michael recovers from his illness, he returns to thank Hanna. A rather lopsided love affair ensues--Michael enthusiastically in love, and Hanna somewhat erratic in her behavior. One day, Hanna disappears, breaking Michael's heart. Years later, when Michael is a law student, he once again encounters Hanna, now as the defendant in a war crimes trial. As Michael listens in horror to the testimony concerning Hanna's participation in the Holocaust, it dawns on him that he alone has a piece of information that may reduce her sentence. Michael's agonized pangs of conscience over whether to come forward and help Hanna, or allow her to pay for the sins of the many form the crux of this tale. This is the post-war German dilemma in a nutshell. Do they all share the blame?<br /><br />What was striking about this film was the thorough depiction of the effects that guilt has had on post-war German society--all kinds of guilt. There is the guilt of the parents who \\"all knew\\", the guilt of the survivors, the guilt of the perpetrators, the guilt of children who cannot love their parents for what they did or did not do. This is the profoundest guilt of all--the one that has torn the post-war generation of Germans from their wartime parents. As one angry law student put it, \\"They should have put a gun to their heads!\\" Indeed if they had, if most Germans had refused to participate in wholesale atrocities, whether actively or passively, then the retroactive guilt of the next generation would certainly have been lessened. But wartime Germans cooperated with the Nazis. Why? Because they were told to do their jobs.<br /><br />If anyone reading this review thinks that \\"I was just doing my job\\" is a trite excuse, I would ask you to go to Wikipedia and look up the \\"Milgram experiment.\\" Shortly after the Eichmann trials, a Yale social psychology professor by the name of Milgram conducted a series of experiments in which ordinary people were asked by an authority figure (someone in a lab coat) to administer a series of electrical shocks to a \\"student.\\" When the shocks were administered, the \\"student\\" (an actor) screamed horribly and begged them to stop. The authority figure calmly told the subjects to continue administering electric shocks. The majority of participants, ordinary Americans, continued administering shocks until the \\"student\\" was \\"dead\\" (three lethal doses).<br /><br />Originally, Milgram designed this experiment to try to uncover the basis for the Germans' cooperation with something they knew to be morally wrong. The answer to his question was that ordinary people everywhere (the experiment has been conducted in many locations over a span of 40 years) will obey authority even in the most morally questionable circumstances. Most important of all, their obedience is enhanced by the presence of other people who are following suit. In short, when an entire nation obeys, it becomes nearly impossible for people--of any nationality or social station--to resist authority. The end result is that they will almost certainly do things that shame and repulse them, and which go against their deepest moral beliefs. American or German, British or French--they do what is wrong. And they pay the price.<br /><br />What we can and should learn from this film is that we are all potential Hannas. And, should America ever be judged for wholesale crimes committed against Iraqis (Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo), or Native Americans, or the Japanese, or African Americans (Tuskeegee), I am absolutely sure we would respond in precisely the same way the Germans did--with denial, with excuses, and with the time-worn phrase, \\"I was just doing my job.\\"German, British or French--they do what is wrong. And they pay the price.     What we can and should learn from this film is that we are all potential Hannas. And, should America ever be judged for wholesale crimes committed against Iraqis (Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo), or Native Americans, or the Japanese, or African Americans (Tuskeegee), I am absolutely sure we would respond in precisely the same way the Germans did--with denial, with excuses, and with the time-worn phrase, \\"I was just doing my job.\\"
B002BIULQC|5.0|I am not a fan of Hannah Montanam but the kids loved it and have watched it at least 6 times since it came out.  I also have to admit that I really liked it also, the moral part of the story was something all kids should see.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|Dave and company have truly come back.  I have almost every album the band has put out.  When THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED came out, at the time, I thought that that was their best album since PEACE SELLS...BUT WHO'S BUYING?.  I was mistaken!  ENDGAME is their fastest, thrashiest, and most brilliant album since PEACE SELLS.  There is not a single filler track on this album.  In fact, the album is to be best enjoyed by listening from start to finish.  A true return to form.  Still can't get enough of the guitar solos and Dave's growling vocals.  A must have!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I found the book tedious. The writing is pedestrian, and has no elegance or interest, so I endured it just to discover the plot. There is exactly one well-turned phrase in the book.    But the plot was tedious, too, because I knew two things would happen: first, the protagonists would escape every situation, no matter how dire; and two, the things we learned initially would change by the end. With those two factors, I had no reason to invest in the story, and found I was skipping the sections where Langdon got in trouble--there was just no reason to bother reading it.    The descriptions of places in Washington, D.C., might be interesting if I lived there and knew of them. But to describe a place as typical, then later describe it as astounding, gets a bit old and makes me distrust the author. More skipped pages.    I bought the Kindle edition because of the hype. And that's all I got.
B002C6A6F4|5.0|I ordered this movie movie, and it was as great as it said it was, had two day shipping and got it faster. Came on time, and was in plastic. and great shape. loved it, and not to mention it's cheaper than on the market:=) cheaper is always better:)

A realization of what our parents and grandparents went thru before imigrating to a place that held hope and promise for the future.  A good read of critical times hard to deal with, of strengths and weaknesses of character within the suffering family of an alcoholic.  It will be donated to my favorite library in Mexico.
0823015033|5.0|Highly recommended for people looking to get into figure work. I picked it up mostly to supplement my special effects studies to understand sculpting the body and was blown away.     The proportioning system is straight foreward and laid out in intricate detail. Even better, she shows you all the different genders and ethnicities all in the same section as options. Still better are her how-to's on handmade tools I've spend bundles buying on my own at hobby stores.      Better still how to scale you projects, something that even my high-end sculpting books would barely touch with a ten foot pole, she tackles full on and unabashed. Not only will you make to scale figures, but you can also check out how to make them into miniatures as well! Which is tough as most books reserve scaling for foundry work.     She doesn't leave much to the imagination, nor spares any rock unturned to show you how to use it and encourages you to expand on that knowledge! Wow, where can I find a teacher like that?     All in all, this is a must have for the doll hobbyist or even just the morbidly curious. A big plus is that all the materials, including the clay, are readily available in stores or online. A very fun and informative book, enjoy!
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Clive Davis should be sued for promoting and producing this album as Whitney Houston's comeback, and for encouraging her to make an embarrassment of herself. This is not a Whitney Houston album. I am not even talking about the lack of range and power that was her hallmark-- it doesn't even SOUND like her. Even her speaking voice has changed in a weird way. In the Oprah interview, she sounded as if she had new dentures-- there was some weirdness going on with her speech, some slur or lisp or click, and you can hear it on the album.     Whitney-- I was rooting for you. But you should have never put your name on this.    OH well, at least I can go back to my Bodyguard CD, and listen to \\"I will always love you\\" ---sad, sad, sad, that THAT voice is gone--- every song on this CD is a pale shadow of Whitney's previous greatness.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Last year in July I lost my mother and I went online and saw that a track from Whitney Houston had leaked onto the internet and the excitement began. Like I Never Left spoke volumes to my grief as I thought about my mother. People started talking about the return of the VOICE and being a huge Whitney Houston fan I started campaigning for Whitney with my family, friends, co-workers even church members. I knew Whitney would come back because God had given her a gift that NO man could take. When I finally got the CD and listened to it from beginning to end, I couldn't stop playing it. I never thought about her singing the way she sang 25 years ago when I heard her sing with Teddy Pendergrass. It didn't matter to me. All that mattered is that she was once again using the gift that God had given her to interpet the songs that she had chosen to sing. Absolutely blew me away. This is the only CD i play in my car to and from work, during work, at home...I bought 4 copies, 2 for myself and 2 for family and a friend. The songs spoke to me I Didn't Know My Own Strength, I Look To You, Salute, Million Dollar Bill, Nothin But Love, all of the tracks! I am so happy she is back getting stronger, reconnecting to God, reaffirming her faith, doing what she was born to do! Welcome back Whitney and I pray your continued success! God bless you for blessing us with the gift of song!
0061537969|5.0|... so I could read it as my \\"lunch book\\" when I finished Balducci's \\"Divine Justice\\". Should have read it first! Growing up, two of my favorite things were \\"fur persons\\" and racing sports cars. So you can imagine my feeling that this book just zeroed in on my heart. Depressing and tragic in places, uplifting, enobling and enlightening in others but definitely worth reading. The book brought back great memories of the dogs in my life and rapid trips over the winding roads in the the West Virginia mountains in my Triumph. It had to displace a lot of books to hit my top 5 list but it definitely did so.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|Director Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant) teams up w/ Johnny Depp (A Nightmare On Elm Street, Sleepy Hollow, Secret Window, From Hell) for this entertaining slice of devilish hokum. Depp plays rare-book dealer / con-man, Dean Corso, who is sent on a mission to locate, authenticate, and nab two copies of a legendary tome. Unfortunately, these editions are far from ordinary, dragging Corso ever deeper into a supernatural conspiracy of satanic eeevil. Heavy w/ forboding atmosphere and full of odd characters, THE NINTH GATE is the best occult-mystery I've seen since CLOSE YOUR EYES. Depp is (as usual) excellent, as are Frank Langella and Lena Olen. Emmanuelle Seigner is unforgettable in her role as the green-eyed girl. Highly recommended...
0385504225|2.0|Well, here we are, six years since Robert Langdon finally supplanted Harry Potter as America's favorite fantasy hero. And now, after the \\"National Treasure\\" series aped the symbol-lore-thriller gimmick Dan Brown introduced to a generation of gullible readers, Brown returns the favor with \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"    It's hard to begin to say how truly derivative this latest Brown potboiler-with-pretension really is. Let's start by recapping the Dan Brown formula, which permeates all his books:    1. A seemingly naive protagonist who is the best at what he/she does but finds himself/herself thrown into events beyond his/her control.  2. A paternalistic figure--sometimes, literally, a father, but often an older mentor of some kind--who becomes the central go-to helper for the protagonist but often turns out to be a villain  3. In the case of the Langon books, a troubled female character with a genius intellect and major real or surrogate father issues  4. Powerful authority figures who try to thwart the protagonists' objectives, but, in spite of having the entire resources of a city/country at their fingertips, always seem to be fooled by the protanogists' simple deceptions  5. Peripheral characters, most often unattractive technology geeks, that provide technical support and little else to advance the narrative    To the basic formula, add the special cliches of the Langdon novels:    1. A mysterious call from a Langdon associate/admirer that drags him into a murder scene  2. A set of symbols that begins an long and drawn out chase of other symbols  3. Long-winded exposition of religious/metaphorical/new age themes  4. Assistance from powerful mentors who guard the so-called \\"secrets\\" that the chain of events threaten to reveal  5. A psychotic young male character with superhuman strength and pretensions, usually motivated by religious fervor  6. Pursuit by inept authority figures who have a personal connection to the central theme  7. The pairing of Langdon with the father-figure-seeking, female lead with genius intellect and a history of family dysfunctionality  8. Some kind of central device in which are encoded The Answers  9. Life threatening situations with deus ex machina interventions    Now, there's nothing necessarily wrong with repetitive potboilers that recycle the same plot elements. Janet Evanovich has played her same bag of tricks over and over and gets away with it because she understands that the Stephanie Plum novels are little more than comic books with words instead of pictures. Brown, on the other hand, seems to believe that throwing in page after page of ancient history and lore, religious philosophy and ritualistic arcana somehow elevates his trash to something resembling literature. Certainly his publishers buy into this with their \\"illustrated\\" versions of his novels.    One could forgive Brown's pretensions if \\"The Lost Symbol\\" wasn't so darned boring. The central theme--the mysteries of the Freemasons--isn't compelling, unless you find the history of secret society rituals among the rich and powerful interesting. The central \\"crazy killer\\" is little more than Hannibel Lecter with delusions of godhood. The seemingly villainous authority figures are so inept that one wonders why America has any national security at all. Tne endless travel book-level expositional passages that introduce the narrative set pieces seem more designed for Expedia that for a narrative.     Worst of all, Brown's ideas are bankrupt. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was compelling because it combined a balance of potboiler conventions with an interesting alternative history of Christianity that was believable on the surface until Brown's 'factual evidence' was proven to be based on fraudulent sources. In that book, the relevation of the alternative history could have changed Christianity forever.     In \\"The Lost Symbol\\" the stakes of revelation are self-serving, rather than earth-shattering. And his clumsy attempts to legitimize the new-age snake oil sophistry of noetic \\"science\\" by equating it with the Freemason practices and philosophy are laughable and embarrassing--particularly when he devotes the last 20 pages of the book to a glorified undergraduate term paper on the subject.     What's too bad is not that Brown will make additional millions from this trash--hey, he's got to feed his family, too--but that \\"The Lost Symbol\\" will ultimately greater publicity for and interest in noetics rather than Freemasonry. After all, progressing in the latter requires a commitment to self-improvement through education and community service. The former is based on the same gullibility that drives belief in spoon-bending and ESP. In a nation where more people believe in UFOs than evolution, the writing on the wall needs no Langdon for interpretation.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I received this CD from, of all places, Buenos Aires. And it came in perfect condition. This is still selling in stores for upward of $25. I know the music well since I have the cassette and am now replacing all of those with CDs.

B000A6EXNO|5.0|This is a great item for Nikon camara's with the ROUND eye piece i.e. D700, D3, D3X & so on.  The DK 19 eye cup allows you to not have your face smashed up against the rear of the camara.  Honestly I do not know why Canon & Nikon do not make these stanard for their camara's (expecially the high end one's).  Putting it together is easy just follow the supplied instructions.  It help's alot when you wear glasses which I do.  Get one they are cheap & do a better job than the OEM!
0061766089|5.0|I was lucky enough to get a pre-release copy of this book...and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Don't be taken in by some of the other reviews.  There are others that are bashing the book because it doesn't tell the reader much 'how to implement' Design Thinking and spends much of its time promoting IDEO.<br /><br />I disagree wholeheartedly with those comments. While this book does promote IDEO's rich history and successes, the book does a great deal to introduce the concept of Design Thinking to the reader. If you're a long-time practitioner of design thinking, this book may not be for you...if you aren't, this book is perfect.<br /><br />According to this book, Design Thinking is the interplay of people and product/process.  When you use a design thinking approach you take the entire environment into consideration when designing a process or product.  Rather than take a look at a few possibilities for a design of a bike (in the case of the Shimano bike story in the book) and build a bike, the design thinker looks at the broader picture and environment to few new choices and possibilities.<br /><br />If you have an interest in Design Thinking or just want to know more about the topic, get this book now.  If you're an academic who wants to see case studies of design thinking in action that show success and failure, perhaps this isn't the book for you.
B000PBLFFS|5.0|Charlie Gordon is not very bright, but has a life that works for him.  He does not understand the cruelty of his coworkers, so is able to see them as his friends.  Because Charlie does not understand the limits of his mental handicap, he pursues adult education classes with hope of making himself smarter.  His life seems sad to the reader, but Charlie is mercifully insulated from awareness of the world beyond his reach.<br /><br />His life changes when Charlie participates in a surgical experiment designed to improve intelligence.  The experiment succeeds, and Charlie quickly develops first ordinary, and then extraordinary intelligence.  Readers see the results in Charlie's life and in his understanding of those around him.  Some of these realizations are painful, for both Charlie and the reader.  Charlie's life changes direction again when it becomes clear that his increased intelligence is temporary.  Algernon, a lab rat that also benefitted from the experimental surgery, begins losing his abilities and soon dies.  Charlie declines as well, descending back into the familiar mental fog of his former life.  But now he carries the emotional burdens of self-awareness and memory of a more complex world.<br /><br />This is classic science fiction and one of the most moving stories about mental handicaps ever written.  Although it was originally banned from public school curricula, it is now widely recognized as a valuable part of children's emotional education.  The book's painful emotions produce a worthwhile educational experience.  I highly recommend Daniel Keyes' book to anyone who teaches and loves children, especially those with special needs.<br /><br />Forgive a personal note:  I gave a copy of this book to my wife, Lynnette, while we were dating in college.  It was a rewarding bridge between her mature interests in special education and my lighthearted fondness for science fiction.  Like Charlie Gordon, we build the bridges to others that we can.  And remember them.
0385504225|5.0|What an amazing accomplishment!  I'll now need a Dan Brown \\"guide\\" to revisit D.C. This Robert Langford adventure is even better than the Da Vinci Code, and the author's delving into the scientific and metaphysical aspects of knowledge that suggest what our nation's founding fathers were really trying to create in this country are the most inspiring ideas I've come across in a long time.<br /><br />The action is fast-paced, and I was trying to finish the book at one reading, but my tired old eyes finally rebelled.  I think this one is probably the best novel I've read this year.  I got my copy from the library, but I plan to buy a copy to keep and read again.<br /><br />Thank you, Dan Brown, for a wonderful, wonderful reading experience!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is a review about the type of package you get with the Bluray. First to those who are complaining about the price... if you think that this pack is really going to sell for more than $30 on release day, you are a poor shopper. Target, Walmart and others will have a special first week discount just like they did with the Bolt Bluray/Dvd combo pack and Amazon will most likely discount it to be competitive as well. Second I think the appearance of Blurays bundled with Dvds is the best thing ever! Here is why: I am a childless adult and I love animated movies like Wall-e, Bolt, Ice Age but let's face it--they are KIDS MOVIES. MOST KIDS DO NOT HAVE A BLURAY PLAYER IN THEIR ROOM. As such, the largest audience for these movies is not going to find much use in a Bluray unless the whole family watches it in their home's entertainment center. Most parents will not buy a Bluray and instead buy a Dvd due to price and its usability as I just described. Junior is not going to drag the Bluray into his room only to find out it does not play on his Dvd player and then leave the disc it on the floor among his toys like all the other  Dvds he has collected; at least that's what parents don't want so they don't buy the Bluray. So this package is ingenious because it solves this problem and you get every possible format. I bet many would not have otherwise bought the Bluray if it did not have this Dvd addition. I wish all Blurays were packaged like this because I am always willing to pay $5-10 more than that special multi-disc Dvd edition to get this! Are you film companies listening?
B00006ADFL|5.0|This is Peter Jackson's first wholly serious movie, after his early spatter comedies, and is also Kate Winslet's first film. It is based on a true story, and the diary entries read aloud in the film are actually from the diary of Pauline Parker, played here wonderfully by Melanie Lynskey, before she fell to such crap fare as Coyote Ugly and Sweet Home Alabama. By the way, the real Juliet Hulme went on to become popular and prolific mystery writer Anne Perry! She apparently refuses to talk about the incident in the film and has never confirmed what actually happened.    The film opens with a 1950s documentary about Christchurch, New Zealand, which are all over-vivid colors and over-chipper happiness and contentment. This smash-cuts into footage of the girls running and screaming, blood spattered all over their faces. We flash back to 1953, in which Juliet is introduced as the new girl at school. She is quite superior and precocious, proclaiming her love of art and Mario Lanza. She and Pauline begin to bond because they are both excused from gym class because of health maladies and vast amounts of childhood time spent in hospitals. Juliet still has tuberculosis, although it is then not bothering her.    They start to spend vast amounts of time together, usually at the house of Juliet's parents, who are wealthy. They invent an entire medieval-themed world of a royal family and their court, acting out scenes they've invented, and creating clay figures of its prominent characters. The film often segues into fantasy sequences in which the background changes around the girls or they interact with a world of walking clay figures. They are often running around in breathless excitement, seemingly excitement for the sheer enjoyment of excitement, and shunning anyone outside of their union. \\"We decided how sad it is for other people, who do not understand our genius,\\" Pauline writes. In their relationship, it seems that Juliet is content to be brilliant, and Pauline is delighted to worship her.    There is a tinge that flirts with lesbianism in their relationship, although more in a devotional than sexual way. But it comes out in the intensity of their love, absolute devotion to each other, and scenes in which they play at being the married king and queen, at one point enacting Juliet giving birth to Pauline's baby [as the king and queen]. Both adult women later said that there was nothing lesbian in their relationship, although that question often simply means \\"did they have sex?\\" and excludes the deeper love and devotion that could also indicate a lesbian relationship.    Soon Juliet's tuberculosis flares up, and her parents place her in a distant hospital while they leave the country for a few months. Juliet and Pauline exchange letters every day, written as the king and queen, in which they express their undying devotion. This separation came at a welcome time for both sets of parents, who had begun to become worried about the intensity of the friendship. Juliet's upper class parents worry that the working-class Pauline is corrupting their daughter, and Pauline's own parents seem to consider her the main source of the problem as well. They take her to a psychologist who outright says she is passing through a phase of lesbianism, which he classifies as a \\"mental disorder.\\" Around this time Pauline has started to focus on her mother as the source of her problems, and think what a wonderful day it would be if her mother were murdered.    SPOILERS > > >  There is upset at Juliet's home, as her mother takes in a needy patient [she's a psychologist], and is soon revealed to be having an affair with him, right in her own home. Juliet's father loses his university job at this point, and it is decided that the parents will split, and Juliet will move to South Africa. Both girls then decide to go ahead and murder Pauline's mother so that they can later run away together. They plan to bludgeon her with brick wrapped in a stocking. Their mental states at this time are characterized with numerous flights into the fantasy world of the clay royal family. Finally the \\"blessed day\\" arrives. They go on a picnic to a remote area with Pauline's mother, distract her, and as she turns away, bash her with the brick. They have to hit her repeatedly, becoming covered with blood, and we connect this with them running, bloody, after the murder, as we saw in the film's opening moments.    Soon after this the film ends, and we have some titles telling us that their plot was soon unraveled, and they were both sent to prisons, their sentence including the clause that they could never see each other again. The film portrays this with a fantasy sequence in which Juliet is on a cruise ship, slowly sailing away and leaving Pauline forlorn on the dock.  < < < SPOILERS END    It's quite good, very rich, and leaves you with a lot to think about. Not so much the story, which pretty much starts at point A, gets to point B and then stops, but the characterization, the way the story is told, and the texture of the relationship. I have a very learned Freudian psychologist friend who I often consult, and he had a little story I thought of while watching this film. He was in therapy with HIS analyst, and my friend said he didn't understand the kind of hysteria young women can get into, for example the famous footage of girls swooning over the Beatles. His psychologist thought that for young girls, the excitement IS the excitement, and the very screaming and jumping and swooning is IN ITSELF the fun. This was on my mind while watching this film, as it really plays on that, as the two girls ramp up their fun by constantly running and screaming over made-up crises or triumphs.    What is interesting about the film is the way it shows the way the girls serve as an echo chamber for each other, amplifying their frenzy until it takes a murderous turn. It also does a good job of dramatizing the facts and creatively portraying their fantasy world,but without ever providing an easy answer or pat explanation as to why their friendship veered into murder in this case. Everyone's performance is good, but the two leads are really wonderful and deliver committed performances that seem mature beyond their years. If you're in the mood for an interesting psychological portrait with a major in female psychology and a minor in lesbian overtones and a murder thrown in for good measure, this one's for you.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones tuck away in a pocket, I can whip them out and get them on faster than any other kind.<br /><br />They are comfortable and low-profile.<br /><br />I like this version without the volume control as the cord seems to last longer and when I want less sound I just pull them away from my ears a little and they still stay on well.<br /><br />These headphones have really good cords compared to others I've had.  By the time there is a short, they have given me  easily enough use to justify the price (which I consider very reasonable).<br /><br />I like how I can hang them around my neck and don't have ear pads to be concerned about losing or roughing up.<br /><br />I love these so much, but don't see many people wearing them.  So I always keep a stash of new ones to replace any that develop cord problems.  I've never had headphones that didn't develop cord problems.  These easily last twice as long as others.  I hope they stay in production forever, but in case they don't, I have several new unused pair ready to keep me going for years to come.
0385504225|3.0|I want to be fair to Dan Brown.    Elitist literary critics say that Brown is not a good writer, and that his stories are bland. I personally think that if you manage to genuinely entertain and awe your audiences, then you have accomplished something worthy of reading. I also think that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was nearly an impossible act to follow. People will have all sorts of crazy expectations for your next book that you won't be able to fulfill. As such, I write this review as fair as I can, trying to assess it on its own merits, but comparisons are inevitable.    The Lost Symbol isn't a bad book, but it is a letdown. I didn't like this one for the same reason I didn't like Angels and Demons as much. Also, Brown doesn't advance the story at a good pace. A good two-thirds of the book (I'm not exaggerating, I counted the pages) was filled with variations on such a scene:    Character A: Have you heard of X?  Character B (usually Langdon): Yes, but I thought that was just a myth.  Character A shows or tells B something.  Character B reacts with shock.  Then, insert scenes of people walking from one place to another, being chased.   Then, insert the sentence \\"Suddenly everything made sense.\\" At least for the next ten pages.  Repeat.    After reading this, I had to wonder whether Brown is a writer on Lost, where people can't seem to give straight answers, and where scenes never resolve any questions.    Here's my advice to Dan Brown:    1. Fire your editor. There were some whole passages, even chapters, that served no purpose other than to inflate your book to an unnecessary size. I don't mind reading big books, but I do mind reading through unnecessary words. Ch. 69, for example, is unnecessary. If your editor didn't ask you to take it out, then he should be fired. Sorry.    2. We don't need to know exactly how every character moves from one location to the next, which turn they took, what street they walked across. If it serves the plot, if the geography is important(as it was in Angels and Demons), then fine. Geography was crucial at certain moments in this book, but many times, the passages when you describe how someone moves from one part of a house to another part, what door they opened and closed, all that is boring and tedious.    3. Don't write your novel like a screenplay. Whether you've done it consciously or not, your short chapters read as if you had in mind exactly what camera shots you expect out of an inevitable movie adaptation. Leave that to the screenwriter. If they can adapt a book like \\"Naked Lunch,\\" they can surely adapt your book as well. Write your novel as a novel.    4. Be careful of hubris. You're in a unique and rare position that, I'm sure, many authors dream of: your books will sell millions by default and you will get a multi-million dollar movie deal without question. Good for you! Some authors handle that well (e.g. J.K. Rowling), some don't (e.g. Stephen King, Michael Crichton). It's not that the latter are bad writers, but that they are capable of writing some really bad stuff. Having said that, I'm not saying that The Lost Symbol is bad, just that it needs to lose about 100-pages of unnecessary, repetitive scenes. Speaking of Crichton, the reason I stopped reading him is that he became too formulaic. All his books are about a bunch of mismatched experts going to some remote location and something goes wrong. Formula isn't bad per se. Rowling is formulaic too. Most of her books revolve around the Hogwarts school year, but she puts enough story in there to make it work. You should do more of that.    5. Know what you're good at. You know your technology, which makes your book authentic. You also know that your readers are likely to go Google a painting or artist you mentioned and be awed by what you described. That's great! I bet that also saves you the pain of having to request reprint permissions of artwork and such. Also, since most people don't know their history, let alone the etymology of words they use everyday, you have literally an endless supply of stories. That's what you're good at. I'd say, forget the science stuff. It's interesting, but, as with Angels and Demons, it's an awkward fit. I don't recall there being any modern science in The Da Vinci Code and I was fine with that.     6. Try a recurring character. Langdon is fine, but consider having a character or two that returns in subsequent books. Make them interesting, of course, and don't make them a love interest.     So, here's the good news. Dan Brown hasn't nuked the fridge, at least not for me. Also, now that this book is out in the open, readers are likely to give his next book a much fairer assessment. So, I look forward to reading that, but, I probably won't be buying it on the first day it's out.
0896898288|3.0|Laurie's new book is delightful to look at and, the finished quilt is beautifl even though the fabrics do not reflect the era.    The biggest problem with the book no where does it state the actual size of the template pieces.  All 106 templates are one to a page and therefore, you need to waste paper and ink to print these out.  Laurie and the publisher should get on board with today's quilter.  With effort and patience you could locate these public domain blocks in BlockBase and print from there.      I would hesitate to purchase another one of Lauie's book without seeing it in person.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Can you imagine having your emotions banned from society? Well, if you can't, then you'll have to watch Equilibrium to see for yourself. Here, we see a Fascist regime that has banned all forms of human emotions. Christian Bale is John Preston, a man of the highest rank for this notorious empire. At first, he sees human emotions as a plague upon humanity, but after he doesn't take his medicine due to an accident, he beings to experience emotions. Here, we get to see the good things in life, like music and color. But that's not the only thing that makes this film so recognizable.  We also have some tense action sequences. They may not be very realistic, but they're still so spectacular to look at. The cast is a great ensemble, though I did find Emily Watson to be a bit wooden at times (for a person who actually HAS emotion in this movie). Overall, I tried hard to love this movie, but I ended but only liking it. It is a very good film, but it's not one of my favorites (mostly due to the slow pace in the middle of the film, and some unnecessary choral music).
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Any negative review for this album seems to begin with, I'm a longtime PT fan, however...  This review is really no different.    Granted, it may take time to absorb the full album, but The Incident sounds more like a mix of pop music with already existing themes lifted from the Insurgents, Nil Recurring discs (even a partial riff from Knight Rider on the second disc!).      Some of the music sounds pretty good, but other music sounds (other than Barberi's sound effects and scapes) like pop music.  Gavin Harrison sounds more like an untested session drummer, not the explosive and one of the world's most talented drummers, on a bunch of songs.      Porcupine Tree suffers from being a band that always redefines themselves from album to album, so it takes time to reacclamate to their new music.  When I first began listening to the album, it seemed apparent that the first disc would be like Signify, where the whole amounted to a larger sum than the parts, at least in my opinion.  I find the whole experience of Signify to be magnified as a whole than many  of the individual tracks.  I haven't quite gotten to this point with The Incident.     As music as a whole, even the worst PT music excels most contemporary music, hence 4 stars, but as a PT album, I'm not being left with the same sort of experience that any of their previous albums gave.  As of now, this isn't Fear of a Blank Planet good.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|This is not the Whitney Houston most of the world had come to adore in the 1980s and pre-Bobby Brown, let's be honest about that. However, this is a new voice of a woman who has gone through hell and back. She has endured and has entered a new phase of her life and career...and she does well enough with I LOOK TO YOU. No, she doesn't sound the same as she did on \\"The Bodyguard\\" or \\"Waiting To Exhale\\" soundtracks, but you definitely know it is Whitney and she sounds comfortable in her new register. To those out there saying that she sounds awful and can't sing anymore - you ought to be ashamed of yourselves because you know it just isn't true. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH HER VOICE!! You're making it seem as if she sounds like Macy Gray. Just stop it. We've seen this sort of thing before. Remember Natalie Cole's fall from grace? When people were saying her career was over, she came back strong and shut her naysayers up for good.<br /><br />Whitney's back on the right track, so PLEASE stop with your tired old hateful comments and show some respect. There are people out there that are quick to forgive a talentless Britney Spears for her drug use or give a pass to Madonna for, amongst the many things that she has done to offend people, publishing a tacky book with nude photos of herself to get the world to pay attention to her. Yet these same folks want to hold on to whatever ill feelings they have for Whitney for her lapse in judgment. What's the REAL deal with that, I wonder.<br /><br />With that being said, I'll be the first to admit that some of the song selections aren't exactly what I expected. There are some good tunes on I LOOK TO YOU, but my main issue with some of the others is that the songwriting is below par. I don't blame Whitney for this; to me, her voice is still a fine instrument. It's just that some of this material is weak and really not worthy of Whitney's time. For instance, R. Kelly wrote the title cut, \\"I Look To You\\" and it's been said that he wrote it years ago especially for Whitney. Supposedly other artists were dying to record it, but Kelly claimed he only wanted Whitney to sing it. Well, you can believe that if you want to. IMO, maybe Kelly SHOULD have let someone else record it instead. It's a slow, lumbering ballad and not even Whitney in her prime could make it sound interesting.<br /><br />Best cuts are:<br />\\"Million Dollar Bill\\"<br />\\"Nothin' But Love\\"<br />\\"Like I Never Left\\" (Duet with Akon. Heard this song last year when it was leaked over the internet, loved it but I would have preferred for Akon to stay in the background and let Whitney do this alone.)<br />\\"A Song For You\\" (It's the classic song amped up as a club jam - catchy but as a club banger, it lacks the tenderness and the romance of the versions that the Carpenters, Donny Hathaway and the Temptations had.)<br />\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\"<br />\\"Worth It\\" (This reminds of me of Mariah Carey's \\"We Belong Together\\".)<br />\\"Salute\\" (Perhaps a goodbye to Bobby? Maybe. But it's quickly becoming my favorite song on this CD)<br /><br />In short, it's respectable and worth owning. Is it perfect? No. But contrary to what some of these reviews are saying, it's a very decent offering from this legend, this icon who has risen above all the drama in her life to give something back to those who love her. How many of us could do the same if we were in her shoes? Don't call it a comeback, as she says in \\"Salute\\", because she never really went anywhere - she's always been here. And I sincerely hope that she stays. Nippy, ignore the haters - we still love you like you never left.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 starsespecially for Whitney.

B000UOGHKS|5.0|i don't care if critics consider this a flop or how controversial it was, this is MOST artistic album that Madonna has ever done. She uses spoken poetry in her songs and uses house/jazz to set the mood. I honestly think that Erotica album has a great theme. It's very sensual, moody, dark, and intimate. It really feels like i'm in some cafe. Not only do I find this album very artistic, but also very underrated. It's definitely one of my top five favorite Madonna albums. if you listen to this album, you will find that not all of the songs are bout sex. don't let the album title fool you.<br /><br />1.Erotica-the beats are cool. \\"give it up do as i say..give it up and let me have my way. i'll teach you how to....\\" I love her Dita Parlo look in the video. Her nails and thin-pencil eyebrows. I love it. It's one of my favs. 5/5<br /><br />2.Fever-Madonna spices up in her version. I love the video where she has different looks. 5/5<br /><br />3.Bye Bye Baby-bye bye bye baby bye bye...it's your turn to cry, that's why we have to say good bye..so say goodbye\\". yup, i can relate to this song. this song goes out for all women who don't take any mess from guys. you tell them, madonna!!! 5/5<br /><br />4. Deeper and Deeper-a great party song. one of my favorites. it's a great song to dance to when you're in the club with friends. 5/5<br /><br />5.Where Life Begins-i love her use of metaphors in this song. \\"it's finger-lickin good\\"!!! 5/5<br /><br />6. Bad Girl-my most favorite off this album. i play this song all the time. she looked gorgeous in the video. 5/5<br /><br />7. Waiting-i love the spoken poetry in this song. 5/5<br /><br />8. Thief of Hearts-fun, hilarious song! it's one of those catgirl fights. it's really feisty. 5/5<br /><br />9. Words-i can relate to each word...lyric by lyric...i know when a man tries to sweet talk you and make everything seem so perfect and surreal. yup, i've been there and done that. i played this song alot when i was going through a very painful heartbreak. 5/5<br /><br />10. Rain-i adore this song!!!! it's so uplifting and inspiring. everytime i take a shower, i think about this song. it's beautiful. 5/5<br /><br />11.

Did You Do It?-this song is actually from the \\"Waiting\\" song. they just included some rappers to this talking some crap.it's completely useless. she should have included the erotica remix instead. I wouldn't bother with the explicit version for this reason. 1/5<br /><br />14.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|This third season of Dexter is fantastic!  The character is evolving beautifully and the supporting characters are exceptional.  By the third season of any series it's not unusual to see a distinct decline and a bit of 'seen it before' but not with Dexter!  I really hope the powers that be don't feel they have to go in another direction with future seasons - this would spell disaster, in my opinion.  Excellent stuff!
0547258305|4.0|There was a lot that I liked about this novel: a strong, female protagonist; an interesting romance with a twist not often found in teen literature; betrayal and murder; mentions of controversial issues (birth control, child abuse, extreme sadism). However, this was Cashore's first novel, and I think it really shows.     Graceling is a novel about a girl named Katsa who is born in a fantasy world with a \\"Grace\\", an extreme skill. The few who are born with these Graces have a physical characteristic (their eyes are each a different color) that sets them apart from their friends and family, and are often feared and exploited for their skills, which include anything from being Graced at fighting to being Graced at holding one's breath for impossibly long periods of time. Katsa (Kat) is Graced with killing, a Grace even she detests.    I enjoyed this part of the plot, the idea that some people are born different, and Kat was an interesting character, a woman who has learned to channel her Grace into something she can almost (but not completely) control. Then she meets Po, a Graced Prince from a distant island who is searching for his kidnapped grandfather, and suddenly everything changes.    I love Kat and the relationships she forms with characters throughout the book. She's not a flat, stereotypical woman who wants love and marriage and kids; in fact, she's the opposite, secretly taking herbs to prevent her from ever having children and adamantly refusing to marry, even when she does (against her will) fall in love.    But like I said, this is Cashore's first novel, and it does show. Cashore has a lot of talent, and her writing is superb, but she really needs to tighten the plot in some areas, and elaborate on others. The ending especially was incredibly rushed; the antagonist is defeated and all is well again and la-di-da in the last fifty pages, and rather anti-climatic-ly at that. The Princess Bitterblue is a rather 2-D character, unrealistic for a young girl.But I think that, like with any author who keeps writing, Cashore's skill will improve over time, and I do look forward to anything she may write in the future!
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Thankfully this includes more performances than the first cut.  Many are still missing, so this isn't the ultimate final cut.  Still, for years I thought Janis was left out because she was too messed up to perform, but now we see her in all her glory!  Music rights issues...they ruin so much!  Still, there is a reason for them so I'll not complain..too much.  Like being there and not having to get wet, dirty or stoned!
B0006L0LOS|4.0|I can recall seeing this when I was at the Drive-in a few years ago, and I was surprised that it was panned as much as it was.  I actually liked it.  I recall people saying that this Catwoman made no sense because of the origin presented.  Personally, I think the origin story here made more sense than Batman Returns did.    Think about it.  Selina Kyle in Returns and the Phillips character in this film were both found by cats after being thrown off of high distances and survive an attempt to murder them.  Returns showed Kyle going completely ballistic afterwards and taking on the characteristics of a cat because of her abuse from her employer and her downtrodden life.  This abuse and unhappy life was another thing that they had in common with each other.  But how does Kyle acquire her agility and athletic prowess?  At least this version of Catwoman gave a reason for it.       Well, if you like it, watch and enjoy it.  If you do not, don't.  I think I have said enough.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I liked the first two Langdon books.  But, this is a painful read.  It is as if Dan Brown tried his hardest to make this book the most complex one to date.  But, because of his mediocre writing ability, it turned into a great big mess.  The plot is so convoluted that by the time the full plot is revealed, you simply don't care anymore.  Unfortunately, when I buy a book, I have to finish it no matter how painful.  And this was a VERY painful read.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I think that this album is one of the best rock albums in a long while has everything from hard rock to song that make you feel good.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Despite a few bad lines, this movie is a decent sci-fi film. It has blood, gore, well-done fight scenes, a monster, sword fights, and Ron Perlman(Although he is not a big part in the film). Although the movie had limited engagements in small theaters, I believe that it would have made some good money in the big theaters. This is a good type of movie to watch on a friday night, when there is nothing great on tv. So grab some popcorn and enjoy this friday night flick.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Was I expecting more? yes, ... reason? since 2007-08, all<br />I heard was how great this was going to sound. One problem,<br />I never heard this from Apple Corps. In fact, Apple barely<br />(If at all) said anything. That I know of. Except, Itunes might have rights to the Beatles songs. That was in 2007? I think.<br /><br />So why the BIG expectations? I think one reason, Apple didn't say very much, ...at least I didn't hear or read anything, other than, their songs were being remastered. So I think fans drew their own conclusions. I know I did.<br /><br />I listened to about 5 CDs, I skipped a couple, but, from CDs dating from 1963-68, I listened very carefully, and I can hear a difference. But, if you're expecting these re-masters to knock your socks off, it's probably not going to happen, ...does it sound better? yes. Could it have been better? yes.<br /><br />It's a bit crisper, cleaner, and LOUDER.

B000002UAI|5.0|Short review, but different than the others.  I can recall as a ten year old waiting for this album to come out.  My two older siblings waited by the store window, and when it got back to our house, we listened to every lyric, every musical note over and over and over.  I can remember the excitment like it was yesterday, though well over 40 years ago.  The reviews and critics will many times compare style and impact of yesterdays artists to todays musicians and forget the impact of the trail blazer's.   But there will never again be another group of trail blazer's in Rock and Roll like the Beatles.  Every album was a breakthrough.  Each succeeding album broke new barriers.  No one since has drawn the immediate interest of generation after generation of people, nor been copied and sung by others.   But this one, this album... as I sat on the floor hunkering down around the LP record player with my brother and sister... listening to their stylistic composition of  Berry's \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" or Paul's meloncholy \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\", there was nothing like it.  I now know that the real problem with excellence is when each succeeding album followed, we listened less to the last and looked more and more to the next.  There was a insatiable hunger for their always maturing style of music that crushed us all when it was said that \\"Let It Be\\" would be their last album.  But for a ten year old... this was where it started:  Beatles for sale.  Oh baby!  I was SOLD.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I waited a long time for this book's release, and I was not disappointed. While I enjoyed DaVinci and A&D more, I thought this was a very good novel. Normally, I don't read fiction, but I am into symbology. Therefore, I do read Dan Brown novels. I particularly liked the \\"lecture parts\\" that everyone is more disappointed with. The action portions were less enjoyable for me.    I don't understand the less-than-stellar reviews for this book because it is just as good as any great thriller out there, i.e. Grisham, Cornwell, or Clancey. What more can one want from a novel: you learn something, and you are thoroughly entertained. This book delivers on all counts.    Dan Brown also changed up his basic boiler plate. The bad guy was known from the beginning. This alone added tension because you were waiting for other developments that weren't really there. The book kept the tension and surprises coming, I thought.    Dan Brown is my favorite author and just may remain so. Can't wait until his next book.
B000001EHS|4.0|I have seen the new Def Leppard live with Vivian Campbell in concert each of the last two Augusts in 2008 and 2009 in a big outdoor arena type show with 25,000 fans, and they have NOT disappointed. Wonderful job by the entire band, everybody is a super musician by this point, and Campbell has been in there now since I think 1996 or so. This CD covers a time period of some of the very best DefLeppard classic or pop Brit heavy metal hits and is well worth the money. Buy it.....these are the same recordings remastered that you have heard on the radio for over 20 or so yrs and you WILL love it.
0385504225|3.0|After reading five books by Dan Brown, I think I finally have him figured out.  Sure, I might be slower on the uptake than others, but bear with me.  The things he does best is weave, and I use that term lightly, popular culture, high technology, pseudo-science, and mystical esoterica into what one can best describe as a \\"fictional narrative\\" but what is, in fact, lecture notes disguised as literature.    The best part of any Dan Brown novel is the interest I, personally, get in hunting down his source work and researching more of the topics and technologies that he puts forth.  My inner-nerd OCD runs overtime the days after finishing one of his books.  So I got that going for me, which is nice.  In his newest work, The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown focuses on the Masonic Order (the Freemasons) rather than the Knights Templar, the Catholic Church, NASA, rouge AI, or sharks with laser beams on their heads (that was in Deception Point, right?); and places the action in the mystically aligned Washington DC.  Seems that hero Robert Langdon was summoned to DC under mysterious pretenses, and so begins the historical trek through the city once known as Rome to its builders.    The Lost Symbol is filled with little known facts, legendary artifacts, lots of running, a thrill or two, and intellectual jargoning.  If you are into that sort of thing, please, by all means, read this book, and enjoy (despite what you will read, I did enjoy the book on that level).  If you are particularly focused, you could burn through the book in a good six or seven hours.      Thanks to The Lost Symbol, I really want to visit Washington DC again, this time with a better trained eye, and hit up the Smithsonian.  I also have taken a deeper look into Noetic Sciences and ordered a few books.    Now the problem arises though, as I mentioned before, after getting acquainted with the author's writing style and his use of \\"cheats\\".  Dan Brown's \\"narrative\\" is cognitively disjointed and removed from how peopleactually are.  The \\"cheat\\" here is in the heavy use of intense flashback to fill in the plot.  That is a cheat, only because people in the situations he puts his characters in his book would never be able to, in real life, have intense, detailed flashbacks, in the time frame given.  It just does not happen.  While it serves to fill the reader in on plot details, it \\"pauses\\" the action for the reader too unnaturally long.    In The Lost Symbol, an iPhone is mentioned, by name, often enough where the reader begins to think \\"how much did Apple pay him for this?\\"    The second cheat Dan Brown uses is his exposition.  The conversation between Langdon and Teabing in Teabing's chateau in the superior Da Vinci Code was chill inducing; not because of the information being presented, but because of the way it was being presented.  Intellectuals might very well argue this way in an environment more conducive to, well, arguing, but if you are 1) on the run from cops and 2) on the run from an albino assassin, one does not stop to explain the entire occult history of the Catholic Church.  But I digress.  Half the conversations in The Lost Symbol would never happen in real life.  Almost all of his \\"smart\\" characters are people you never want to invite to parties...sure, they might be good for a different opinion or four, but you would be finishing up a six pack and bowl of pretzels before they took a breath.  A basic conversation would go like this: \\"So, Robert, what do you think of national health care?\\" \\"As we all know, health care originated in Coptic Ethiopia when, considering the root etymological form of \\"healthcare\\" is heal which in Greek....blah blah blah\\". What is truly appalling is that these \\"conversations\\" are merely literary sheaths for Dan Brown's library notes.    Finally, Robert Langdon. Many, many authors are guilty of the \\"Robert Langdon\\", basing their titular characters on themselves.  I got into Robert Langdon in Angels & Demons (better book than Da Vinci Codeor The Lost Symbol).  He kind of lost me though, half way through Da Vinci Code, and in the Lost Symbol, I was done.  Dan Brown is basing this character on himself, supposedly.  Mid 40s, ruggedly good looks, tweed jacket, insufferable genius, in great shape for his age, Harvard professor, played water polo in college.  Yes, that's right, water polo.  I have nothing against water polo, but if you are just going to completely fantasize yourself as an intellectual Indiana Jones why not give yourself ESP and retractable adamantium claws while you are at it.  These know everything and do everything author homunculi are getting long in the tooth. I would not be surprised that in Dan Brown's fourth book in the series, The Bimini Road, Robert Langdon discovers Atlantis due to his sudden ability to breathe underwater and converse in ancient Druidic with a long lost tribe of sea apes.    I just made that last sentence up.
B000006TRV|4.0|Tho I am not the biggest possible PF fan, this is a terrific album, now remastered and a great CD. Many of the hits listed here have become HUGE FM radio staples.......and thus this CD is essential to any collection. I was not disappointed; it almost sounds like a greatest hits collection, but that is just not possible with PF with only one CD; you have Dark Side of the Moon, etc.
B00288KNLS|4.0|I'm usually disappointed in movies made from books that I have read, but not this time.  There are some changes in the movie from the book, but it was very good.  My granddaughters loved the 3-D version and their 3-D glasses.
0307269981|4.0|For about the first 550 pages I thought this book was fantastic and even better than The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, which I loved. The plot is intricate, with lots of excitement, well developed characters, and threads that go off in different directions and keep you wondering how they all tie together. Salander remains a compelling character. There are repeated allusions throughout the book to events in her childhood that make her the inscrutably interesting, skilled, and quirky person she has become, and this happens often enough that the reader is left with an expectation that all will be revealed in the end. In a way it is, but in my opinion, not as skillfully as the remainder of the storyline. THE most influential person in Salander's life does not show up until the very end of the story and then I found his presence kind of murky. There is no physical description in a book of deftly drawn characters, very little dialog that might reveal more about who he is or why he is like he is, and Salander's way of dealing with him in the end was a bit anti-climactic for me. There are a couple of character threads that I thought just petered out (Berger, Faste and Hedstrom)  Lastly, I found Salander's last escape to require a bit more suspension of disbelief than I am capable of. Overall, I was left with the impression that the author had just about crafted a masterpiece, but had to rush at the end to meet a deadline (or something).<br /><br />Still highly recommended--4.75 stars. Larsson was so talented, though, I hoped for more at the conclusion.
B001SMC91M|5.0|I heard this band on internet radio and bought the CD.  The whole album is great, kind of James Brown-ish with a rocking beat.  I will definately buy more as they are released and I'm hoping they tour the North East.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I was a huge fan of the Da Vinci Code and had a big expectation of this book and got it immediately when it came out.  It was boring, perhaps the storyline is so similar to his other books starring Robert Langdon.  While reading the book, I felt like I was back in school.  I felt like I was being lectured to often times - A History of Masons - if you will.  I dozed off at one point. The characters were very likable but the antagonist's background was predictable for me. Needless to say, the book did not live up to my expectation.  Thank goodness, I bought the kindle version (9.99) and not the actual book.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|It is  great buy  for collectors of Star Wars, although I wish I had bought the Full Screen version.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|This is definetly the rap album of the year. The bar was set high for this album, especially after the release of the huge hit single \\"Day N Nite\\". But the album was pushed back on numerous occasions and Cudi started to fade into the darkness after \\"Day N Nite\\" started to fizzle on the radio. But it wasnt accidental, as Cudi claimed he wanted to maintain a low profile until his debut album dropped. He avoided any unneeded hype and publicity by laying low and not releasing much material until his album dropped. Cudi is obviously talented, that was obvious after a couple of listens to some of his mixtapes. And what separated him from the rest of the crowd of young and talented rappers (Drake for example), is the fact that Cudi isnt trying to impress anyone. He is just flat out making music and sticking to his guns and doing what he knows how to do best, and that is make interesting hip hop music. His style is one of kind, making it very hard to determine exactly what genre he would be qualified as. Some people call him a Rap artist, some say hes pop. I personally, dont know what i would classify him as because some of the album sounds like rap and some of it sounds like light rock or even pop. Take for example, \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life\\", which is a phenominal showcase of Cudi's rapping skills as he glides smoothly over this very contemporary rap beat. Cudi spits venom over producer Emile's banging beat, making the track an instant classic and probably the best track on the album. \\"Solo Dolo\\" and \\"Cudi Zone\\" are both very typical/standard rap tracks with their roaring synth a bass, both of which are also standouts on the album as Cudi shows why Kanye signed him in the first place, his rapping flow itself isnt the best ive ever heard, but its his out of this world lyrics that make him such an interest artist. But where Kid Cudi excells most is in his diversity. While the tracks i mentioned earlier are perfect examples why people say Cudi is one of the sickest new rappers/flowers out right now, tracks like the underground mellow rock track \\"Simple As\\" and the bright-happy go lucky \\"Up Up and Away\\" show how truly diverse he is. No other rapper could pull off an album like this. It is completely different than anything i have ever heard from a rap artist before. Like i said, its hard to even call this a hip hop album because alot of the album is techno/light rock music. Like the Kanye produced banger \\"Sky Might Fall\\" with its vibrating synths and Cudi's light  vocals it could almost be considered a techno song if it weren't for his killer rap verses. And while this album isnt flawless, as it has several songs that dont exactly click with me, its so unique and different from anything i  that it would be a shame to rate it anything lower than a five star rating. Thats how truly unique and diverse Kid Cudi and this album are. Like even on the bad songs (Such as the lame attempt at a R&B song in \\"Enter Galactic\\" which is truly an embarrassing song to listen ), Cudi still captures you with his out of this world style. And like many other reviewers have commented, this album is also enhanced and sounds even more futuristic when you are under the influence of certain drug that has a side effect of the munchies lol. But that was Kid Cudi's goal with this album. He wanted to make a drug influenced trip-hop album with a purpose besides money and hos. And he was successful, and after this album, Kid Cudi is cemented as one of the most unique and diverse rappers out right now. And like i said the album's music quality isnt perfect or flawless, but because of how extremely different this album is than any other rap album out right now, i have to give it a five star rating. As long as you listen to this album with an open mind (And if you are under the influence lol), im sure you will be just as confused and pleased as i was after the first couple of listens! Good job Cudi on making a completely different rap album than anyone else could or would dare to in this age in rap!            Grade:  A-
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I bought both Mono and Stereo sets. I was pleased to see the Mono CDs are all made in Japan and come in a Mini LP format, along with a small replica of the record sleeve and inner sleeve. At $[...] this is a BARGAIN! Recently [...] opened a Japan store. The prices for both sets are around $[...] each!!
0375413405|5.0|I have watched some of Julia's shows when she was on PBS, and they were interesting. I was rather young then and did not pay attention like I would now, but I remember them being special. I had purchased the book she collaborated on with Jacque Pepin a while back, and it is a beautiful book. I saw the Julia movie recently and I just had to order this one. I am almost finished looking through it. Most of it sounds amazing - especially the various sauces, the lessons on eggs, and the meat dishes and how to prepare the various vegetables. In both of her books that I own, she also gives recommendations on what wines to use in dishes and she is wonderful in describing what to do to prepare a meal. Amazing!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Perfect condition and excellent price. I will continue to buy all my DVD's from Amazon.com.
0307450570|2.0|Not a highly interesting book for anyone who has experience with craft techniques; but would do for someone with little experience.  I passed it on, the day it arrived,to someone who will enjoy it for awhile.  Additionally, many of the projects are repeats from MS Living.
0385504225|1.0|All I can say is if you have read one Dan Brown you have read them all. This isn't even worth the paper it is printed on. He has a formula and just cranks out new books. Also I doubt if a Harvard Professor would be so athletic.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|The album is a masterpiece. I could give a more general review talking about the album in totality, but I will attempt a song by song review for potential buyers as not too many reviewers (understandably) have done that.     The album comes in two discs.   Disc 1 includes a 55 minute experience that goes through its share of twists and turns while managing to remain coherent. Within the very first minute (Occam's razor) you know you're in for something very special. The song starts off with an explosion and builds up the tension thats released with the beginning of The Blind House, a brilliant song, the main highlight of which is an opeth like guitar riff.   Great expectations follows. The song never really settles down mainly attributed to the off meter Guitar riff (which sounds a bit like Red by King Crimson). The song beautifuly flows into the contrasting, Kneel and disconnect - which is very reminiscent of blackfield. The seemingly off key piano outro is one of the high points of the album. This coupled with the ambient voilin creates a surreal psychedelic experience.   Drawing The Line has Wilson singing with a different vocal style. One thats a tad more strained at points.     The Incident follows. The song has a haunting guitar riff that surfaces itself over a fairly detatched sonic landscape - all until the point where you can here a muffled mono voice saying \\" I just want to be loved..\\" which then breaks into the chorus with the same line repeating. Your Unpleasant Family and The Yellow Windows of the Evening Train are slightly less intense breathers before \\"Time Flies\\".  When I heard this song by itself without any context, I thought it was ok, but when I heard it over and over again with the rest of the album I discovered its true beauty. Eveything about it, its lyrics, its structrue, its instrumental part, its drumming give you a feeling of naustalgia and reminescence.     Degree Zero of Liberty takes you back to where the album started. Explosions within a calm sphere. This leads into Octane Twisted which has some of the best instrumental work on the album. This song also reflects on something porcupine tree are doing new on this album - changing scale within subsections to a major scale to further emphasize the \\"sadness\\" of the minor parts. The Seance carries on in this same vain with vocals. The circle of Manias follows. Nice guitar riff and grove, and if you listen carefully you can hear the guitar riff being played in the \\"background\\" with a slight delay.       On a slight diversion theres something I would like to say about what Wilson does. There are times when there is SO much happening. You could break down the tracks to the individual tracks and there would be 30 of them! Even if its just a purcussion instrument or creepy wind like effect. Wilson takes the time and pain to hand craft all these effects to ultimately create a rich soundscape. Its not an easy task mixing so many tracks. I spend months just eq'ing and compressing drums with 3 guitars and vocals and still manage to get it wrong! Its his attention to all these details that places him miles ahead of most musicians today. His ability to envision this kind of stuff and execute it!    The next song is I drive the Hearse. A truly beautiful ballad - a song that could break you down - to end the Song cycle.     Disc 2 contains 4 brilliant songs. Flicker has a nice loop that gives the song its ambient feel. Bonnie the cat- a fun song to jam to for the drummer and bassie I'd imagine! Black Dalliah, typical brilliant porcupine tree! Remember me lover - very different vocal and lyrical style. Theres an innate angst in the song. I like it!    So to conclude, a 75 min album with not ONE bad song. ( Listen to Dream Theater's (One of the better prog bands today) later 75 min releases. 45 of those are worth tossing away!). If this doesn't form the paradigm of a 5 star album , then I wonder what does. Its no less of an epic than Dark Side of the Moon in my opinion. Buy it today!
B0009MAO46|3.0|I recieved the movie in a timely manner and it was, as advertised, new and still in it's shrink wrap. I would suggest better packaging for delivery, as the case was slightly damaged. The movie itslef was in excellent condition and I would purchase form this source again.
B002DMJLTE|4.0|David Chute, that guy at the top who really put this film down, as an editor, needs to really reassess his role as a critic. I can see he probably thought Armageddon was a piece of art? Well, Armageddon is one of the worst I have ever seen. I even left the theater...<br />But Deep Impact, whew! Now that was an emotional ride. Granted, the thing between the kids didn't do much for me, but the overall situation where the impending doom forced the government to choose 1 million people and no one over 50 would be included... That in itself was a lot. The desperation of surviving an event that could very well happen for real knowing there is nothing we can actually do; not even having a ship as portrayed in the movie, is really alarming.<br />The film was well made. Yes, Hollywood was all over it, but it was a disaster movie unlike any I have seen. And I have seen many. Oh, and a Black president! who knew? This trend was then followed by the series 24, and then by our real lives. But enough of that.<br />Deep Impact was a pleasant surprise that summer, one that surpassed even this year's summer movies (with the exception of Star Trek).<br />See it. You won't be disappointed.
1857885082|5.0|I have British friends and it is really true in many respects.  This is a very Entertaining book would recomend it.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|PT/SW have done it again. This double CD is fantastic! Progressing on from Blank Planet/Nil recurring, the boys have taken a leap into the 55min. song territory. What a great trip it is! Musically expanding and contracting, this album has me hooked from the open quiet-then-loud intro of Occam's Razor to the melodic exit of I Drive the Hearse. Moving forward, this propels the listener on a journey, much like channel surfing thru news channels, pausing to look at the strange bits and wonder what it is all about. The second disc is a chance to experiment, much like on Nil. A welcome treat, especially since it does not cost extra!

B0025KVLT2|5.0|I just happend to walk into Starbuck's this a.m. and the \\"Help!\\" album was playing over their intercom/speaker system. Looked down and there it was - Rubber Soul - REMASTERED IN STEREO!! I've already ordered the box set but it's been backordered until mid-October (via Amazon).<br /><br />This is my all-time favorite Beatles album. It was waaaaay before the remaster was even in the works. I have two copies of this album on actual vinyl as well. So of course, I ended buying the album in the remastered version this morning. I was dying to hear the Beatles coming through all of my speakers in stereo surround! Got to my car, barely containing my excitement and I was not disappointed when \\"Drive My Car\\" began playing. I'm suprised I even got to work without wrecking my car because I was so excited and happy.<br /><br />If you're a Beatles fan who hasn't heard the new remasters, hold your breath and take a deep one because once you hear it, there's no going back. This is the sound quality the Beatles have been deserving of for years.<br /><br />I'd buy this album a thousand times over if it meant getting the awesome quality that's as clear as crystal. The bass lines in the songs pound in your speakers and it's just fantastic.<br /><br />This is how the Beatles were meant to be enjoyed. :) :) :) :) :) This has been a long time coming!

B000LX0X76|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this album has some memorable tracks like Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun and See-Saw, but it just seems to me that at this point in time Pink Floyd sounded a little bit too much like The Beatles.  I think anyone who is new to Pink Floyd(don't know who?) should start with their next album, Dark Side Of The Moon and go from there.  As I said in the title, I'm sure this album was a landmark in 1967, but compared to their later works, it's really just not memorable.
B001KEGRC0|4.0|as Imax lover this is a good movie but was found to have a mark on the face of it over the lines, and have to be returned  I will no doubt look again and maybe go for Blu ray in this type . Imax are very good but bit costly at times , If you want a good Grand Canyon  movie  then go for the Hidden Secrets that is a very good one of the canyon with nice music score   I find Imax very good  regards the ordinery dvd with this type of movie short but well worth having. would be nice to get a Imax dvd of New York City from high up with air views from the plane and fit a nice music score in it  that goes with the city Like the naked city. I hope one day it will  be done
B00008BLB8|5.0|CAUGHT IN THE ACT, Grand Funk Railroad's final album for Capitol, is a great live album showing a great rock & roll band going down fighting (they would break up the following year). The only flaw is that it lacks the opening song from shows performed on the 1975 tour, \\"Are You Ready?\\", in order to keep it to a single CD. Nevertheless, you shouldn't pass this one up.

B00004Z4WR|4.0|Gone in 60 Seconds 2000. A car thief, Kip,in a sophisticated organized crime group makes a mistake while boosting [stealing] a car. The boss of the outfit is a ruthless murderer shipping highly expensive, rare cars overseas and wants to use the bungler Kip as an example and to bribe Memphis, Kip's brother and ex-thief with a reputation as the best to steal 50 rare and expensive cars by Friday morning at 8 AM. Memphis resists and then gives in to snatch his brother from being crushed at the salvage lot. He quickly organizes some of the old gang and some new people with unique skills plus his old girlfriend, Sway,he left when he reformed. The movie depicts the psychology of car thieves and car theft, as well as the unique psychology of the different types of experts in car stealing. It shows the loyalty to family and within a ring of thieves to each other over the law. This is contrasted with the ruthless use of money and power and threat of death by the boss to bully and bribe Memphis and the gang to carry out his high-risk scheme. The risk is heightened because the police who had tried to catch him before he reformed finds out that he is back and is once again involved in car theft. The ruthless boss lays down his terms as allowing Skip to live plus $200,000 with the stipulation that they meet the deadline exactly because that is the time the boat shipping the cars is to leave. The ring plays out the nearly impossible feat under the time pressure and while playing cat and mouse under the eye of the police. During the execution of the last heist, Memphis and his old girlfriend repair their lost love and reunite. After a harrowing last chase where Memphis shows his extraordinary skill and his determination to save his brother, he, nevertheless, winds up with the boss ordering Kip to be murdered anyway because Memphis was 12 minutes late. During a deadly tussle with the boss and his henchmen, the police suddenly enter the scene and the fracas ends with both Memphis andthe police pitted against the boss. Memphis saves the policeman's life as he kills the boss. In return, the policeman, seeing Memphis has really reformed and was only back into car stealing to save his brother, decides not to arrest him. As he walks away, Memphis tells the policeman where to find the cars. The gang, having gotten together just to save Kip and for the thrill and comradery of the old car stealing days, has a parting party to celebrate the ordeal and their success, totally unconcerned with not getting the money, illustrating that this crime's appeal is its thrill which is greater even than sex.
0385504225|1.0|Have to agree with many of the posters here. Too many cliched characters: the diminutive Japanese CIA lady straight out of \\"The Incredibles\\"; the tatooed protagonist just the albino from DVC in reverse; the evil Turkish prison guard from \\"Midnight Express,\\" the wise religious man who sees with his hands...I could go on and on. Forget the so-called science. You can see the plot twists coming a mile away. Is there ANYONE who didn't know the true identity of the villain immediately? Or the location where it would all end? Or what was inside the box Langdon was given? But I think when it got to the \\"drowning\\" scene, I lost it completely. I simply could not believe he would re-create a scene from a 20-year-old movie.    What hasn't been mentioned here is the absolute idiocy of the characters' behavior. A brilliant scientist lets a stranger into her secret lab because she receives a TEXT message? Who wouldn't question that? By her own admission, her brother didn't even know how to text! The use of phone messages throughout is maddening. A major CIA director hears someone saying, \\"I'll be there in 20 minutes\\" and never questions that he might be lying? Langdon flies off at a moment's notice without any confirmation that the person he's speaking to represents the person he says he does? And SURE, I'll bring along this sacred thing that I've been told to keep hidden for years just because you say so! DB keeps using this same device over and over and it simply defies all sense. \\"Oh, well, this person says he's my brother's doctor--my brother who's been MISSING--so, sure, I'll just run right over there and have a chat with him.\\" In a private home that looks nothing like a doctor's office. \\"Sure, I'll have some tea!\\" And why on EARTH would a wealthy and powerful man like Peter Solomon not have some kind of security around to begin with? Would the guard at his building really let a limousine pass through without seeing who was in the back seat? No video cameras anywhere to capture him carrying out an unconscious man? Too much...just, too much.     Plus the repetition. I wish someone would count the number of times Langdon says something like, \\"But the blah-blah is just blah-blah,\\" only to be shown a few pages later that--OMG, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY! After the fiftieth time it happens, wouldn't Langdon maybe keep his mouth shut or learn that things \\"aren't always what they seem\\"? And the ending. Without giving anything away, what exactly is the point of the pyramid and the secret codes and symbols if the answer is already known? Doesn't that make the entire plot pointless to begin with? It's not really such a big secret after all, is it? Why wouldn't everyone be screaming it from the rooftops instead of shrouding it in secrecy? I literally could go on and on. You could teach a course in senseless plot points based on this book.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|It is hard to choose which season of Dexter is the best. They are all so varied and full of twists and turns as is Season 3. There are great performances by Michael C. Hall and Jimmy Smits who is totaly out of character as a bad guy. Great season and looking forward to new season.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I'm not going to review the songs---the point of this particular incarnation of the White Album is the sound quality of the remastering, and here it's just great. The previous mass-distributioned CD of this album has a very muddy mix to it that sounds like everything has a blanket covering the speakers. On this version, it's a revelation---the audio is so distinct and so nicely remixed that you almost do feel like you're in the same room with the Fab Four as they play this for you. I also did the \\"boom-box test,\\" and on my ancient,less-than-ideal 1993-era boom-box, the album still has a great deal of sonic resonance. The folks doing this re-mixing took the time and care to do it right, and it pays off. This is the best version of this album on CD to date.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I enjoy this CD from beginning to end. I purchased it a few years ago and it is still relevant in my collection. An all around good pick if you enjoy similarly styled artists. Enjoy.
B002LCCNW8|1.0|We didn't deserve this.  After waiting with so much anticipation, it is hard to imagine how much the Arctic Monkeys would bore me with this CD.  I don't mind experimentation, but the whole album being this boring??  C'mon!  Their Producer had WAY too much influence on this band and they made a serious mistake.  Believe me, I totally get wanting to listen to it a few times to get to like the \\"new direction\\" but this just isn't worth it.  I LOVE these guys, but this CD is to be skipped over.  Remember why we loved you, guys.  Wake me up when the new one comes out.  I am eager to get my hands on it...
B001TOD9VI|5.0|If you're on the fence about getting this Blu-Ray (or DVD), hopefully this short recommendation will help you.  It's a must own disc.  The Blu-Ray transfer is spot on, with just the right amount of grain, and the soundtrack and score will give your 5.1, or in my particular case, 5.2 system, a workout.  Highly recommended, whether you are a wrestling fan or not, the moral of the story will not go unnoticed.  Mickey Rourke makes you wonder where he's been all these years...leave it to a brilliant Director like Arnofsky to uncover an actor's talent.  Bravo.
0307588335|5.0|As a business journalist, I have tried to read as many 'meltdown' books as possible. The books that have a human focus always read better for me than the strict dollars and no-sense ones. \\"In Fed We Trust\\" is one example; and \\"A Colossal Failure\\" is another.     McDonald is a character; from his days selling pork chops to having his 'chops' busted on Wall Street. One can't really laugh at a firm going in the tank but McDonald can see the humor- dark as it is. And he spares nothing in ripping CEO Richard Fuld and his merry men.     He is the type of guy you'd like to have a beer with and play a round of golf or go to the racetrack with. Much of the terms in the book would be foreign to many readers. McDonald sees that and makes an attempt to explain the meltdwn in plain English. And, to a large degree, he succeeds.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|when i was about 12, I only owned a few cds, but this was one that i had to obtain. my first Beatles album was srgt pepper's, and that was my favorite for years, but this one grew on me as i aged, and now a young adult, is one of my favorite albums. i bought it for \\"got to get you into my life,\\" and \\"goodday sunshine\\", but now i adore every last song from doctor robert, down to here there and everywhere, which to me is positively a spiritual experience.
0307408833|5.0|I bought the Babycakes Cookbook from Amazon a few months ago and made the chocolate frosting.  It was awesome!   Very creamy and delicious!  I love the pictures in the cookbook and all the wonderful healthy recipes.  I only use agave to sweeten when I bake.  I have had the pleasure of visiting Babycakes in NYC two times now and it was so fabulous!  I am like a kid in a candy store!!  I do not consume white refined sugar at all so its a total pleasure to consume healthy beautifully decorated treats!  To Erin and all the staff at Babycakes, Keep up the good work!!
B000002LEU|4.0|This is a great record. Joy Division is the one of the best bands ever, period.  This is an excellent starter to get into Joy Division.  It's a great record also.  I only gave it 4 stars because I'm not a big fan of compilations.  The disc is packed with great songs taken from all points in Joy Division's short career.  The problem is the band advances it's sound so rapidly from it's first songs to there last. It comes off sounding a little choppy to me.  If you really want to experience Joy Division at their most powerful listen to \\"Unknown Pleasures\\" (The 2nd best record of all time)and \\"Closer\\" (The best record of all time).  This is not to say that Joy Division don't have good individual songs (They do and in spades!!). Joy Division are best when listened to in a full album.
B000008KK7|5.0|Following up the superb, \\"Arise\\" from 1991, Sepultura further progress there sound with this album, \\"Chaos A.D.\\" which may be the best political recording in Metal history.<br />Furthering the band's focus on the harsh treatment that the band's country Brazil had faced in that time and extending it towards the problems and grievences of ALL who live under tyranny and opression, this album reigns as a powerful classic.<br /><br />The sound is the perfect fusion of Traditional/Mainstream Thrash with the sounds of the Underground with an emphasis on groove and drum sounds that create a sort-of tribal quality. Compared with the con-current sound of Pantera, this band had created a much more refined and intelligent form than many other pretenders of the time.(Not to knock Pantera but this was a far more intellectual release than \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" could have ever been).<br /><br />Each song is a classic for the band led by opening track, \\"Refuse-Resist\\" which next to \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\" from the previous album is the band's most beloved song. \\"Territory\\" follows suit in a similiar brutal fashion and likewise tracks like \\"Amen\\" and \\"Slave New World\\". \\"The Hunt\\" has a level of accessibility about it that reminds me of more anthemic Thrash, though the subject matter is something else. \\"Manifest\\" is one disturbing track detailing in a semi-news tone the atroctites commited at a Prison riot in Brazil in 1989.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the band following this release will all but abandon this sound and much of there Thrash roots for good. This CD is a unique one. At once both brutal and yet meaningful and even, inspiring. It could very well be the best of the band's career and certainly one of the top Metal releases of the 1990s.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I wrote a rave review for the first season because of how incredible and sublimely perfect it was. I also pondered whether or not that kind of magic can be duplicated, and feared season 2 would have to be a letdown after a blockbuster first season.    I was so wrong. Season 2 blew season 1 out of the water. It was better in so many ways. Aaron Paul deserved the Emmy nomination because he was fantastic, Cranston once again was light years better than any performance you will see on tv. The editing, cinematography, music cues, scene location, and direction were just so perfectly blended. Everything about season 2 was great.     But it starts with the story, of course. And naturally youre left, after season 1's finale, wondering what direction the show is going to careen off into and carry a mesmerized audience. The conclusion of season 1 left us with a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, and then season 2 went break-neck speed further past that and well beyond. I was stunned at how beautiful and tragic some of the character developments evolved, such as the scene where Jesse's girlfriend dies, the scene just prior to where Walt is at the bar with (unknowingly) the girls father, and then the action Walt takes to save Jesse from his despair. Its madness and yet its so touching. Definitely one of my favorite sequences.    Or the scene where Tuco has Jesse at gunpoint and Jesse mans up and truly breaks bad by actually overpowering the lunatic Tuco. Real solid character development that had me howling for Jesse's triumph.     You can have your reality tv, your lame game shows, your crime dramas  your adult swim whatever. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to this masterpiece. There has never been a show so engaging, thrilling and groundbreaking as this show, and you will never see a show like this as long as you live. Everything pales in comparison, so enjoy this ride while it lasts, because it seems to me Season 3 may just be the end.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|As has already been said, this is a disappointing rewrite of the Da Vinci Code meets National Treasure.
0061537969|5.0|This was an incredible joy to read.  I read the whole thing on a 4 hr. flight.  I cried, I laughed, I could not put it down.  Reading a book from a dog's point of view was such a unique way to write a book.  I loved all the characters and the storyline was fantastic.
0439882826|5.0|This is a very well done book. We purchased it as a gift and I think the recipient will really enjoy it. He is part of the first Star Wars generation. The pop-ups are amazing!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Been a big fan of Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion's particular brand of slightly off-kilter bravado since Firefly. Dr. Horrible satisfies those needs and who knew Nathan could also sing. Neil Patrick Harris is just as over-the-top as Fillion, to my delight. Bought a copy for a gift and one for myself. We've both been happy to add Dr. Horrible to our DVD library.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I love this true story about saving people's lives right under the Nazi's noses.  Gregory Peck is a believable hero and we can see inside the Vatican during WWII, always a plus.  Compare the scenes from Angels and Demons to see the improvements of time in the storage of the treasures beneath the Vatican. Very satisfying story of redemption.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|Crystal clear and sharp across the board, this Blu-ray transfer is top-notch. Picture quality is just astounding. Beautiful movie to render in such a gloriously high resolution. I have watched it all the way through one time -- plan to watch it a million more.    I can't get into the whole \\"reviewing of the movie thing\\". Sorry to say, but this is just a technical review. It's a great movie with great characters and story. It spawned a hundred episodes in a series because it was SO GOOD. I have owned it in VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray and it was well worth every penny to get the latest version. It looks stellar.    All scenes...still, panning, action, panoramic looked flawless and played without a hitch on my Samsung BD-P1600. I was floored by the visual quality, seeing as how it's about a 15 year old movie. Paired with my Samsung LCD TV, I don't see many of the newest movies looking any better than this one. The sound was truly impressive even on a low end surround sound system.     Well worth the price, I have to say. One of the transfers so far that has far exceeded my expectations.
0385504225|4.0|OK...........Not the same depth as Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons but far superior than Digital Fortress and Deception Point. This easy read left me much more interested in our own Capital and with many points to ponder for some time. Inspires further research. (Wikipedia here I come) I am a huge fan of Dan Brown's writing style and welcome all his books. I read this tome way too fast.    As a senior citizen, I like Brown, Ludlum, Smith, Sheldon, Rowling, Grisham, Baldacci, etc - not necessarily in that order. I read to be entertained & moved and Dan Brown never disappoints.
B000UR9QGW|5.0|It is unreal. Saw this movie at the local Wal-Mart and grabbed it. Had it on DVD already, but thought it would be so much better on Blu-ray. Had no idea that there are some transfers to Blu-ray that fare better than others...    This is one of the best, as far as I can tell. The picture quality is crystal clear - and that's saying a lot for a movie of this age (22 years??!!). And it doesn't look a day over 7. Ok, so it's not as razor sharp as the newest ones, but the fact that this one looks so good is a feat unto itself. Bravo, guys, for making this Blu-ray purchase well worth it. And the sound is simply brilliant on a surround sound system. Everything was crystal clear.     Just a completely awesome old-school horror movie (ie. it's got some thought put into it) and a goodly dose of that Sam Raimi biting humor ... ok, it's corny. But it's very funny. Not quite as funny as number 3 (Army of Darkness) but it's got a good half-and-half mix of comedy/horror that is fun to watch from beginning to end. Loved the Ash character (Bruce Campbell was and still is an underrated actor) and loved to quote the lines from the movie.    Can't wait to get Army of Darkness on Blu-ray. Now all we need is number one to complete the set. Probably won't be nearly as good a transfer -- but I'd buy it. Thanks, guys!!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|This is one of the most celebrated Disney's masterpieces. One who collects Disney classics should have this movie.
0486424510|5.0|I was introduced to this book by watching a PBS program with my younger brother. Since then, I've loved it. Wilkie Collins' ability to craft a detailed plot, eccentric and believable characters, a unique storytelling style...all of that comes together to create one of my favorite books. Relating the events surrounding the theft of the Moonstone via a series of narratives, Wilkie Collins changes voice dramatically from Betteridge, the Robinson Carusoe loving servant, to Miss Clack, a poor and fanatical cousin, to Franklin Blake, the lovelorn hero. Better than his Woman in White, I think this is the best of Wilkie Collins' works and well worth reading...more than once.
0385504225|2.0|I was highly anticipating this book, but alas, it was a tedious and unimaginative read.  It reminded me of sitting through a bad lecture or reading an instruction manual.  Sorry I purchased it.
