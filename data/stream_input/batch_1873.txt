0800141849|5.0|I fell in love with The Mirror Has Two Faces movie when I saw it for the first time. I waited a long time to purchase the movie until the local library and rental movie places no longer keep copy of it, and Amazon is just a great place to buy one. I love Barbra Streisand and Jeff Bridges is just so handsome. They are perfect in this movie for their roles, not to mention that The Mirror Has Two Faces has perfect cast - Lauren Bacall, Pierce Brosnan, Mimi Rogers, George Segal, Elle McPherson and Brenda Vacarro. I love Barbra Streisand for making this movie, producing it, starring it, composing the music/songs in it, and naturally, singing songs for this movie. I love it!

B00A83075M|2.0|EDIT: Rewrite to emphasize this is my opinion and take on this animate film. Not some empirical fact.<br /><br />I had high expectations about this film. It was well received by critics and all the hoopla in the media. However, I left the theater rather disappointed.<br /><br />I said it before and will say again: in a figurative sense, there's nothing original or innovative about this film. Yes, in a literal sense it's a new setting, theme and characters, but in the truer sense it's just nothing there that jumps as something fresh. Same old anthropomorphism, same old predictable plot and narrative.<br /><br />As for the characters, I will quote myself, if I may, from the comments below:<br />\\"Woody and the cast of Toy Story are not only the pioneers but they are the industry standard. They are amazingly easy to empathize with, and there's also a human aspect to the movie in the form of a growing Andy. In Toy Story 3, this [dynamic] reached a climax that had me (a guy in his 30s) openly and abundantly crying in the theater. Lightning McQueen & Co. are also very relatable and there's something to be said about the beautiful imagery and fantastic voice acting of Luke Wilson. However, Cars 2 fell off a cliff. The plot was all over the place, the characters became detached and artificial and plastered with a tried-and-true happy ending. Wreck-It Ralph simply did not speak to me. I didn't find the characters particularly relatable, humor was [completely] absent and I just did not find any particular hook to any of the characters.\\"<br /><br />Also, I'd like to emphasize that this film is not unwatchable and if you have kids who are into video games I'm sure they'll get a kick out of it, but as an adult with hefty expectations, this film simply didn't deliver.
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes has always been a family favorite, I ruined most of my Dad's soft cover Calvin and Hobbes books, so for Christmas I got him this special collectors edition hard cover set and he looked like a little kid when he saw it. He had the biggest grin on his face. I was very pleased. These comics are amazing. I love everything about them and I always get a good laugh when reading them.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I did the online rental--the quality was very good and the film played with no problems.  I loved the film itself--watched it twice during the 2 day rental period... an excellent end to the trilogy.  There were only a few issues I had with the story-line, but they were minor.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have completed the PC version years ago and just started playing the Kindle version. It seems to have been ported as faithfully as possible, considering the inevitable short comings of a touch interface. For example: Your fingers covering the screen when dragging a goo ball. Other than that, the performance seems great and the graphical fidelity is intact.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game, the atmosphere, the gameplay, and the story/themes are pitch perfect.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Awesome movie, hilarious actors, and wonderful music. One of my all fine favorite Dan Aykroyd movies of all time. Watch this!
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Never been in combat, but the movie shows how you have to cope with the military.<br />  Spent a year on the Korean DMZ from 1957-59.<br />  Jarhead shows truthly how a group of young men, thrown together in stress, handle their stint in service to their country.<br />  When you get put on the line you wonder how you would respond to combat and if the yellow streak would come out. We were drunk most every night of my tour of duty. I had to pull guard duty the night i left the my company as we were so short of personel. An alert went off and i ended up walking off my post because i had cleared company and had to swipe a guy's .45 to walk my last post. After fourteen months i was going back to the land of the big PX. The big boat was waiting.<br />  This movie is spot on from my experiences in Korea. This is a how it was for us, and needed told by one who actually lived through it, as we did back when.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|our toddler loves this movie.  He played it 4 times in a row during our recent road trip on my wife's kindle fire.  It made for a very peaceful trip.
B0052U59F4|3.0|Had a good story line but was just a little too unrealistic for me. Maybe it's about what you have going on at home. I couldn't even get jealous.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I'm a big fan of the original movie franchise, Alien through aliens 3.  I think this film is incredible, the special effects with the alien feel even though the original movies were filmed decades ago.  Also you get the extra footage and three copies of the movie.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I liked all the men in black. 3 was informative. Had to go back and watch the others again. Would recommend!

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I love family guy and thought i would enjoy this type of humor, but I quit watching after the first half hour. The movie just seemed to drag and never really got started for me.
B005URRCNQ|4.0|LOVE this record, but it came scratched.  Which stinks because I pretty much love every song on this record.  At least it came also with the CD
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|But it seemed like this story has been stretched far enough. I feel like I have seen this plot many times in earlier movies. It was just ok for me.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I just don't understand how this book can get ANY positive reviews.  The author makes all sorts of false assumptions and ridiculous statements.  I mean really... \\"The guard gives me a nod which says that if this turns out to be a mistake he was just doing his job.  I give him a nod which says he's wasting his time.\\"  WTF do these nods look like?<br /><br />If this book ever saw a real editor I'll eat my shorts.  The characters are not believable.  The grammar is terrible.  The story is weak. The plot devices are many and seem to crop up out of nowhere.<br /><br />Imagine me shaking me head.  Its a shake that says this book is absolutely terrible and urges people not to waste their money on it.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A great novel. Like a modern day Indiana Jones set to the backdrop of Washington D.C. The first 90% had me riveted, I couldn't put it down. The last 10% was kind of slow, almost dragging, after reading the climax. Highly recommended. A MUST READ!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas. I was very happy to see that this cd was unedited and still included the bonus tracks! This was exactly what I was hoping for, and arrived right on time!

B0053TMP24|5.0|I personally think that this book shines for many different reasons. One is the mythology hidden in the plot, characters, and storyline it traps people with a like for myths in the book but also a story that holds on to you.  This book has so many secrets hidden behind each setting, plot, and character.  This book really brings you into each character too and their specific motives for their actions.  Each chapter is narrated by a different character.  Another aspect to this book that will hold readers is the overall main picture that these three books put out there.  You really get a sense of how Geae an evil goddess.that controls the earth, so evil she sent her own son to kill her husband for power and creates monsters to each generation of reining God's, demigods, or titans, has an falsifiable craving for power.  This book will intrest anyone who has a love for myths or even a tiny like of adventure and sacrifice, you won't be sorry about reading this book.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Wilhelmina Pursling has a deep dark secret, and a scandal in her past. Her real name is Minerva Lane, and the reason she's assumed a new name, and tries to stay as quiet, unassuming and unnoticed as possible, is because it would be disastrous if the truth came out.<br /><br />Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clairmont, not only notices Minnie, he's fascinated by her. The son of the rather dastardly Duke in <i>The Governess Affair</i>, Robert hates being compared to his father in any way (not easy when the resemblance is very strong) and has devoted his life to righting the wrongs of the former Duke. He hates his elevated position of privilege, and would like nothing more than to abolish the peerage entirely.<br /><br />When Minnie is accused of writing handbills that incite workers towards riots and strikes, she realizes that her carefully constructed existence is being threatened. She needs to prove that Robert is the true author, while he's determined to charm her into silence, and possibly a dalliance while he's in town. The more time he spends in her company, however, the more smitten he is with her.<br /><br />Milan's heroes are always Protectors. Strong and powerful men who are determined to take care of and protect those around them, but Milan's heroes always have wretched pasts as well. Robert is no exception. He's rich, handsome and powerful and spent a dreadful childhood feeling rejected by both his parents. His father was a tyrant, who exploited people for monetary gain or his own pleasure. Robert is determined to be his exact opposite, if he can. He's sensitive, clever and deeply lonely, and the scene where he tells Minnie about a &#34;funny childhood memory&#34; is absolutely heartbreaking.<br /><br />Milan's heroines tend to be strong, independent and very smart. Minnie  is probably the cleverest one yet. She's fully aware that most people will underestimate her, and uses it to her advantage. One of the few niggles I have about the story is the fact thatin the beginning of the novel, Robert is so impressed and aware of Minnie's brains, but when it comes to sorting things out towards the end of the book, he seems to completely forget that she's clearly more brilliant than him and goes behind her back instead of of including her in the planning.<br /><br />However, even with this minor annoyance, I would still rate this as one of Milan's best books, and I think I can safely say she's my favourite romance author writing today.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read the whole series and this is one of the best but make sure to read the others or u won't get the story

B005DESVPO|5.0|This EP has a great range of styles, starting with the cover of an old blues classic Bright Lights but with Mr. Clark's own lyrics added for additional flair. I am impressed by this first effort and encourages me in my own musical pursuits.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a pure work of art. The perfect amount of action and romance. You won't want to put the book down!
B0076L0S76|4.0|A lot of people who evidently take this film at face value are giving it bad ratings, but they don't get the point here. This is a character study. We are not necessarily here to be made to feel good or to like the characters. We are here to judge whether or not they strike any chord of reality. And they certainly do. Charlize Theron is one of today's better actors and she scores a home run here as a post-college loser who tries to go back home to her small town and steal her old boyfriend away from his happy life and wife and baby. Along the way, she teams with a crippled high school guy who she never even looked at in high school. But today they are young adults, and their lives have taken somewhat dark turns. There's a lot of humor here, but the dull among us won't get it. The title refers to the type of fiction book the main character supposedly writes, though her last book was several years ago and it no longer sells. There's a sad scene in a bookstore that is actually pretty fun. Have you ever heard the term 'dark comedy' people?
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I recently downloaded this app for my kindle fire 2. it's an amazing application that can give your tablet remote access to any pc that has the coupling application downloaded. I have so many plans for my kindle in the future. thanks Amazon!<br /><br />cperk
B00650SSDU|3.0|Neither Justin Timberlake nor his cute co-star show any chemistry here, so it's hard to see why they would become friends with benefits. And I'm pretty sure I won't be spoiling the plot if I give away the fact that, of course, they soon become more than friends, and that's where the complications begin. Typical Hollywood hack work. Timberlake is a gifted comic actor, and I did appreciate his work here. He has good timing, and his body is certainly a thing to behold. You won't laugh, but you'll be mildly entertained.

B009FREK3W|5.0|Jeff Lynne & ELO have been favorites of mine since childhood. Lynne re-recorded each track, but (most of the time) stayed true to the original songs. The result is a better clarity which takes advantage of today's technology. When you come across a difference, it is subtle. I already had each of these songs in the original state, but found these new versions very appealing. Also amazing is how Lynne's voice is as strong as ever. The new track, Point Of No Return is comfort food for any ELO fan; new but familiar. Jeff Lynne may be the most under-appreciated (outside the industry) artist/producer in music.
0345803485|3.0|I bought this to see what all the hubbub was about in the media. It's an okay story with porn thrown in. The best part of this book is the emails between the main characters
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Splashtop Remote showed up this morning as a free app available for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\". I tried it and it did connect to my desktop PC over my WiFi network after I installed the Splashtop server on the PC. Unfortunately, this version does not handle high definition displays. It changed the resolution on my desktop PC causing rearrangement of my desktop icons. I will give the app credit for streaming to my KFHD8.9 a wide-screen, hi-def MP4 file playing in Windows Media Player on my PC. This enabled me to verify that it is the KFHD8.9 internal video player that has problems smoothly displaying mp4 files, not the KFHD8.9 hardware. I shall be more careful in the future when Amazon offers up apps to my KFHD8.9. I thought they actually tested this stuff. Obviously I was mistaken.

B0086449YA|5.0|This double album of new material from the &#34;Sultan of Swing&#34; is just superlative.  A wide range of music here, from pure folk (&#34;Red Bud Tree&#34;) to Celtic seafaring tales (Dream of the Drowned Submariner) to down and dirty blues (&#34;Hot or What&#34;).  Knopfler's music runs the range of emotions and is one of my favorite albums of the new year.

B006ISJQ26|1.0|It seems to me they left out the plot to this movie. Most of the characters are cardboard, things happen that are meant to \\"ironic\\" but which really were just the directory/writer trying to write themselves out of corner. The ending was very unsatisfying, and came on like they had forgotten about it and then realized they were almost out of film. You'd think that with the people involved it could have been interesting.
B009E3EY38|3.0|SYNOPSIS: *P*O*W*E*R*F*U*L* LOWEST-BASS SIGNALS (NORMALLY DIRECTED TO SUB CHANNEL) KEPT IN FRONT CHANNELS<br /><br />If you're not a techno/geek, you may not wish to invest reading any further.  For the techo/geeks or the curious, a nerdy comment on this Blu Ray's 5.1 audio track follows.<br /><br />Quick background: The sales staff at my local Guitar Center (where I'm a very good customer) call me \\"that Insane Home Theater guy\\".  The audio portion of my current home theater setup utilizes, among its two full racks of equipment, a stack of 5 Crown XTi power amps; total power (conservatively) is approximately 3700 watts RMS, all channels driven 20Hz-20kHz.  Why this is pertinent will, I hope, be clear shortly.<br /><br />I own (and watch multiple times) approximately 50, mostly rock, Blu Ray concert videos.  Without exception, they have 5.1 DTS Master Audio tracks -- which I typically select when listening.<br /><br />The Celebration Blu Ray has something unique in my experience about its DTS MA mix.  For whatever reason, the person who engineered the mix elected to direct an extraordinary amount of low bass energy to the front left and front right channels.  (i.e., engineer elected not, as is typical, to re-direct the lowest couple of octaves to the subwoofer channel)  Depending on your home theater's hardware/setup, the consequences of this fact can range from unexpected distortion to amplifier and/or speaker damage.<br /><br />NOTE: This is NOT a judgement of the mix engineer's decision, just a fact-sharing exercise.<br /><br />Being aware of the \\"heavy bass in the front channels\\", and adjusting system settings (typically via your home theater receiver) accordingly can reduce or eliminate any distortion and/or risk of damage.<br /><br />In my specific case, one of the Crown amps pumps 275 watts RMS per channel in stereo into a pair of Polk Audio Monitor70 Series II speakers.  The power match is within the speakers' capability, albeit at the high end of the range.(I've had this particular setup for my front channels for about a year now.)  Yes, I crank it up, but on the rare occassion that I clip the Crown amps, I make appropriate adjustments immediately.<br /><br />About 2/3's of the way thru a non-stop viewing/listening of the Blu Ray, a never-smelled-before odor presented itself.  A cursory check revealed the smell was emanating from from the Polks.  Further investigation revealed no permanent damage to the speakers, and a reduction (and eventual elimination) of the odor after a cool-down period.  (Good news!)  At this point I'm presuming the smell was the components in the speakers' crossover circuits \\"cooking\\".<br /><br />Investing more time (and paying more attention) is how I determined that there was an extraordinary amount of low bass energy in the mix to the front channels.  This is, as of now, unique in my DTS MA experience.  (Again, no judgement.)<br /><br />I simply inserted a 24db/octave high pass filter at 70 Hz to the front channels and no more problem.  Yes, I could have reduced risk of equipment damage by having such a crossover inserted by default, but have found through experience that doing so had negative sonic results (yes, subjective and MY opinion) by reducing what little bass energy remained in the front channels  -- on every other DTA MA mix.  Thus by default, I leave the filter off.<br /><br />Perhaps I dodged an equipment-damage bullet this time.  Here's hoping a fellow audiophiles avoid possible misfortune by being made aware of the uniqueness of this Blu Ray's mix.<br /><br />Other than that?  ENJOY!!!
0895292211|5.0|I bought this book based on other reviews and I do not regret! So much important information!<br />And it all makes sense!<br />I don't care if it was written 40 years ago, this is still very actual and valuable info, if you want to be healthy.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I purchased just one episode to see how it would work on my Kindle Fire.  I LOVE it.  I'll order more.  :)
B009JBZH54|5.0|Feels just like the Batman costume does, right? You draw your fingertips over the cover, it tugs a little, like rubber, but it's velvety smooth. Pull out those disks. The inner case tugs a bit on the outer case, doesn't it? That's some nice friction. Now smell it. Stick your nose right in there. God, it smells just like the inside of Batman's costume. Just close your eyes and smell. Now feel it again. You're there. You're right in Batman's costume. Your dream has come true.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Seriously, deeply racist. I can't hate on it too much, because it was very much a product of its time, but STILL it made my friends and I squirm to watch it.<br /><br />And the worst part it, if you know your musical theatre/film history, you will know that parts of this movie went on to become White Christmas. But by that point, even Hollywood knew blackface was racist, so they gave Irving Berlin and the studio a slap on the wrist for Holiday Inn by censoring the film and refused to let anything similar happen in White Christmas. The resulting backlash from that little tiff was the song &#34;I'd rather see a Minstrel Show...&#34; which is advocating for the days when blackface was acceptable performance material. Then, as a special &#34;screw you&#34; to the censors, the ACTUAL MUSIC from the blackface number in Holiday Inn is played as dance music for Vera and her dark-haired partner in a tap dance number.<br /><br />Basically, not only does this movie add that special, unique hint of racism to your holidays, but it taints other holiday films as well.
159562015X|5.0|I purchased several for our staff and plan to use the results as a training for our staff retreat. I think it will be a great way to assess our strengths and how we might work together more successfully.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Yes. Yes please. In fact, that's really all I want for Christmas. This man is an acting genius, and the fact that I *just now* learned about his role in this film is nothing short of embarrassing. The rest of the story is meh, take it or leave it. But give me my Alan Rickman, please.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a fun Christmas movie and we rented it for only $1.99 on Amazon! It worked great and we had 48 hours to view the movie. What a great bargain.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|got the new kindle fire hd so we loaded this app up on my kindle fire hd the for the free upload
B009ANP48G|5.0|Nice movie, I do recommend for those of you who like music and dance videos. Specially if you live in Miami :-)
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game is soooo much fun.  I love the tournament play for me and then the kids can do a quick-play game without losing my progress.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I have read the other Crossfire Novel and this one naturally followed on.  It was an engrossing book to read.
0930289234|5.0|This is supremely messed up, but it's a must-read. Moore's writing is as twisted as his characters, but it's brilliant and imaginative.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I read all three books in record time and they introduced me to a genre I never knew I enjoyed!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Nope, not a teenager so the love portion of the movie zoomed past but I loved the music!  I just loved it!
B006NXI58M|5.0|You have to read all three books.  They are very easy to read, engrossing and hard to put down.  I loved them all.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wonderful book if this is what you're into!! I enjoyed it a lot and its a great price for the kindle
B005EGXTEE|5.0|You have to read all three books.  They are very easy to read, engrossing and hard to put down.  I loved them all.
B005LAII80|2.0|I'm a very big fan of Judge Dredd and have a shelf groaning with Dredd comics.<br /><br />So I was excited to go see this second attempt at bringing him to the big screen and was highly disappointed.  Dredd for me has always worked because he parodies action heroes even while being one.  He's the sort of 'hero' who'll save a mugging victim, brutally beat (or kill) the perpetrators, then haul in the terrified victim for incitement (you should have known better than to wear jeweled kneepads in this neighborhood).  He's the ultimate fascist hero and in the right hands he makes us cheer for him, and then makes us uncomfortable for doing it.<br /><br />This movie missed that point.<br /><br />You can see them missing the point right there on the cover.  In the comics Dredd's uniform is outrageously over the top with a massive eagle shoulder pad and a badge the size of a dinner plate.  The attempt to make it look more realistic shows the film makers wanted a generic action hero, not a clever parody.<br /><br />So we got a film about a supercop shooting his way through an apartment building and beating the bad guy all in glorious 3D.  There was no sense of self-awareness or satire or even humor in the film.  Everything is just ugly and dirty and unpleasant.  I neither laughed nor cheered.<br /><br />I know I'll be in the minority here but just as the Stallone version went too far into parody this one went too far into the grim.  Maybe in 15 years or so we'll get a movie that strikes the right balance.
B00866H7SS|4.0|This series was recommended after having completed the 50 shades trilogy.  This first book was enough to make me read the second!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|wonderful read at Christmas time, would read every year, next time with the family over a couple of nights. highly recommended
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I have read all three of these books and they are all great and engrossing reads.  I would highly recommend all of these books.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This has been my favorite Christmas movie for some time now.  It is funny and heart-warming at the same time.  Love Will Ferrell!

B00170DEM8|5.0|The music is wonderful and it's a good old-fashioned feel good movie. It's not Christmas without seeing the movie, Holiday Inn!
B003BVFZ4G|4.0|I read this book as it was recommended to me by a friend as it was similar to The Hunger Games.  Great read.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Easy, but challenging enough to be enjoyable for continuous play. No issues with this game on Pandigital Supernova tablet. I will consider other games from Nevosoft!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|You have to read all three books.  They are very easy to read, engrossing and hard to put down.  I loved them all.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|7 year old daughter loves this game and can spend hours playing. Lots of quests and levels to keep it interesting.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I chose to read this book after having read the first one.  This one was no less exciting or engrossing!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this book based on all the great revews it had. After reading it, I know why it had such great reviews.<br />It is a young adult novel, which doesn't normally appeal to me. I would rather read about people closer to my age (mid thirties).<br />It's just one of those books that once you start reading it, you can not put it down. I do not like to give away spoilers, so I will not go into any details. It's a romance but not in a traditional sense. The usual boy meets girl, then falls in love, is so basic compared to this novel. The main characters fall in love but the heart of what makes this book amazing is the past they unknowingly have together.<br />The writing style and editing were well done. Part of the storyline is a difficult subject to write about, but it was delicately handled by the author.<br />Give this one a try!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I have the complete set now 1-4 and just waiting for season 5 to come out and then waiting for the new season 6 to start
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think everyone has played this by now.  Ad supported version, a little annoying but not a serious enough game to get in the way.
B008R14YBK|5.0|My daugher wanted this CD for Christmas. Arrived in time for Christmas. Arrived in great condition.  My daughter and her sisters like the music and have listened to it everyday.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great able to connect with friends and family that i dont see or speak to on a day to day bases.... I have FB on my galaxy II phone an the FB on it stucks...
B00961ZGQC|5.0|My daughter likes this song. Downloaded it so she could put it on her MP3 player.  No problems getting it loaded on.
0307895475|5.0|This guide is amazing! It covers a lot of information and have many illustrations. Beyond this, is very well organized to provide readers an easy way to find the right information.<br /><br />Really worth the money spent!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best I ever read. Sit on the edge of the cliff, good. It is really a must read. .
B006LSZECO|4.0|I almost gave this five stars. I could not put this book down. It was intense. It had so many twists and turns. Amy is amazing. I don't know if that's good or bad. I feel for Nick. I want closure for Nick.  I cannot accept the ending. Sure, I could accept that sometimes life isn't fair or black and white and accept how it ended sort of like Nick did... but I am left unsatisfied. Maybe there is or will be a follow up. That would be worth the read! Ultimately, I loved the book. I would have given it five stars if I still wasn't sitting here hitting my head against the wall wondering how it could of would end if we kept going.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have one and love it.  Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She was thrilled as she loves mine.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is one of my all time favorite shows!  It's fantastic and only keeps getting better!  It's very suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a must on the list of films to watch during the holiday season. It's fun, touching and by Favreau.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I thought this book was pretty boring.  I usually enjoy Tina Fey, but this totally lost my interest. If I watched 30 Rock more often maybe I would've liked it better
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.  I think it is a lot of fun and all the different prizes and levels make it interesting.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I thought this book was good.  Pretty suspenseful and I never figured out the ending, which is awesome because I usually do.  It was a little slow at times but all in all a good, quick read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best ever. Would highly recommend this book. Ready for the next one. Love this book. Great
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen!  This is the first book of her that I read and I fully intend to read the others.  There were parts in this book that actually made me chuckle out loud.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I went to go see this at the theater the day it came out. I was waiting for this movie to come out. I saw it and when it ended I said O MY GOD this was amazing. I thought about it all day and couldn't stop thinking when this comes out on blu ray. It's definetly a buy
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This series came so highly recommended to me that I knew I had to read it.  I liked the first book for what it was, smut.  I don't like how the author writes though, a lot of repetitive phrases.  If you're up for a good sex book though, this was pretty graphic at times...in a good way!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14  it is to bad for kids but great for adults
B005FFW46S|5.0|I've read SNUFF twice now--Terry Pratchett's latest Discworld novel.  Since it features the inimitable Sam Vimes, it's one of his best.  Terry Pratchett uses fables to illustrate social and political problems--and some practical solutions.  The Vimes tales are the best of this kind since, perhaps from GUARDS! GUARDS! in which we first meet Sam lying drunk in a rainswept gutter, definitely from his second appearance in MEN AT ARMS, the Vimes novels focus on social, political and human character change, seen through the eyes of opinionated, angry, frustrated, but persistent Sam Vimes, always looking for the moral solution and finding it more often than most people do.  So SNUFF isn't just about Sam's vacation with Sybil and Little Sam any more than his other excursions out of Ankh-Morpork (e.g., THE FIFTH ELEPHANT and THUD!) were only for diplomacy.  Remember UNSEEN ACADEMICALS?  How Pratchett makes us see through the mind of an Orc (not Ariosto's & Spenser's sea monster--but the land-monsters invented by Tolkien as perfect soldiers: conscienceless, obedient, immensely strong and violent). Unfortunately for us humanists who admire Tolkien's stories, he never explained why the Orcs deserved to be wiped out if they were created by human sorcery to have those qualities. Pratchett tackles Orc rehabilitation in UNSEEN ACADEMICALS, where Sam is a minor figure but is on hand as an amazing, brilliant, philosophical Orc humanizes himself. He, and we, come away with an entirely new view of Orcs, and hopefully are less tempted to judge others who have been mythologized as \\"hopelessly evil\\".<br /><br />SNUFF seems to be a follow-up novel, probably inspired by thinking, \\"What other creatures did Tolkien demonize? Why?  And was it a fair judgment?\\"  In SNUFF Pratchett brings Sam Vimes to a place where humans and Goblins are in conflict, Goblins coldly murdered, stolen as slaves and nearly extinct, their old culture almost lost because of persecution, living in filth, stealing to survive. Their habits are exaggerations of those attributed by our own \\"respectable\\" society to Native Americans, African Americans, Gypsies and immigrants (especially from Mexico), and, of course, Hitler's caricature of Jews.  Like Orcs, Goblins are assumed to be predestined as non-human and evil, and are hounded by all except a discerning few.  With the help of one of those who know the Goblins as people, Vimes begins to understand their plight--and that their treatment shows humans to be the real barbarians.  That's already quite a story, but you're only half-way through!  Pratchett skillfully goes on to take Sam Vimes through adventures and perils of all kinds that will keep you reading under the covers till dawn, until Sam is able to bring their situation to Discworld's attention in a moving climax. (You'll get a nice side trip to Quirm in this book, too, although after reading it you may wish to avoid paddle-boat travel for a while.)  SNUFF IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I rarely review apps, but this one is good. They nailed the retro arcade race game perfectly. Actually the graphics are a better than the original outrun, would actually like to see everything more pixelated. But very fun.<br /><br />For those complaining about the graphics not being good enough, that is the point, its supposed to be a retro game.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|wow. this is an amazing game. everybody should get it! I think it may be BETTER than cut the rope. I couldn't believe its free! Wow! Its so fun. so, stop reading his review &amp; get it already!!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It was very entertaining and I really enjoyed it.  Some parts of the movie were a little provocative and I don't know if I would have gone to a movie to see it.  But I did enjoy watching it on my new Kindle Fire.

B008XG1X18|5.0|...The best thing ever...get so many good things from it..shopping..recipes..decorating....crafts...just an awesome way to connect with everything...simple to use...thanks for sharing
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I love this album, so I love owning a real copy. Great deal. Something I will hang on to forever.
B00782O7IY|4.0|Introduction:<br />Few films can cause you to hesitate about buying a ticket.  The Artist is one of those movies.  The type of movie is enough to stop you.  A silent movie in the 21st century?  Not really something you think about seeing.  However, this is a movie definitely worth a trip to Redbox, Netflix or Amazon.<br /><br />Why did you choose this rating?<br />This version comes with UltraViolet, which is something I'm slowly moving towards.  As more people store their movies online, this is helpful because it allows you to essentially buy two copies at once.  The movie is well packaged and comes with a few, but not many, extras for viewers if that is something they are interested in.  The quality of the movie is also very good.  I would like to point out that it is meant to be shot in that frame size.  Several have commented on that and because the movie is a throwback to classic movies, it is supposed to look like that.<br /><br />What did you like or dislike?<br />I enjoyed the score.  I am a big fan of film scores and have an extensive collection of soundtracks from many powerful films.  This one is no exception.  Yes, it LEGALLY borrows themes from other movies, but it is still strong and can easily stand on its own.  The acting in the movie is also very good.  Many actors in the movie are American actors we've seen in &#34;talkies&#34; before, but seeing them act silently with music is impressive.<br /><br />The story is not an original one.  As my title suggests, it is a silent movie version of Singin' in the Rain.  It's a movie about the transition from silent movies to talkies and how pride and egos can get in the way of a person's career and happiness.  They are lots of movies about this so don't expect anything original about that.  How they approach the story is what should impress you.<br /><br />Who would you recommend this product to?<br />I would recommend everyone see it at least once.  For those of you who love tributes to classical movies thatwe have grown to admire and respect, you should definitely buy it.  The movie has many moments that will inspire you and will bring a smile to your face or a tear to your eye.  And with the UltraViolet copy, this should definitely receive some consideration.<br /><br />Summary:<br />A well-crafted movie for a good price.  A film that pushed boundaries and was rewarded for its efforts.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This is a good app it works. But sometimes the app time outs and sends you back to home menu or it has an error and doesn't load the page.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The movie had some funny parts and was entertaining but I thought it would be better based ont the previews I saw.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I was angry at the price for Rarity. after that I quit the game. The price go up to 99.99? This is a little kids game with high prices. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!  It was fun until then
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Good game overall, but had some issues with the controls and being able to build certain structures.  Specifically boxes with crosses inside them seemed to have a one or two pixel window where it would work
B0074EIQQU|4.0|I absolutely love Mars Volta I've been a fan since 2002. Lots of experimentation in this CD. Cool CD but not their best.

1423140605|5.0|First thing my son did christmas morning after opening gifts was go to his room and rip through about 80 pages of this book before breakfast...think he likes it!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Fun, silly, not much to it but simple enough for everyone to play including my 5 year old and my technically challenged parents. Somewhat therapeutic!:-)
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Yet another great heroine. I admire Sanderson's ability to write a believable female protagonist. I'm not here to discuss the story details as others have done this already. This just to say it is a fast moving easy read with an interesting premise. The central question of what makes an individual a human being and what constitutes a soul matches the secondary question of whether there is a difference in looking at an original or a perfect forgery.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love all the songs on this cd. They are all beautifully written and I can listen to it over and over without getting tired of it. Especially Perri's song. It always moves me to tears and makes me remember how I felt the day I met my husband. It is special when you find a song that can bring up a great memory from your past.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you or your little one likes Angry Birds, they will love this new one.  My 5yo son love both Angry Birds and Star Wars so this is a huge hit.  He's gets excited when new characters are introduced.
0142501123|4.0|Cute story for preschoolers. The book material felt a bit cheap to me. Wouldn't buy it for a gift. Cute story though.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I loathe the ads between games. I'm going to delete it. It's annoying and sometimes I can't stop the ad! I'll finde one that lets me play without the annoying interruption.
0756666937|5.0|I bought this for my six year old son... both my husband and son are enjoying this book!  Excellent quality! Beautiful pictures and amazing fun facts about Lego. Would make a great gift for anyone who loves Legos!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I never had this game before I purchased my Kindle Fire. Now I can waste as much time as I like taking revenge on green piggies!
0312430000|4.0|Dr. Gawande does a great job putting into plain English the amazing benefits that checklists have produced in the complex world of surgery.  He gives many exmples of how use of checklists can benefit numerous other industries and professions as well.  This is an easy read and well worth it.
B004YXE438|5.0|The puzzles are colorful and the subjects are fun.  Since downloading a few days ago, I have already done many puzzles.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I keep buying people gifts they end up not using--love this movie and it seemed perfect fot the recipient--oh well.  The vendor did their part--good copy delivered promptly!  I recommend them.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is scary and is similar to the eight pages I recommend this to anyone who wants a good slender for the kindle
B00936A0RU|4.0|Lawless is by far still a great action flick based on a true story.  Most of the actors do a great job with the characters they are acting as, I agree totally that Gary Oldman didn't get much screen time but still worth the screen time and memorable.  I personally enjoy these style of movies and when I heard that it was going to be out in time for Christmas I put it on my Christmas list.  It still has good fight scenes, some very nice gun shoot out scenes and the brother's standing up to the law and what they believe in the principle of the matter never lay down for anyone, stand your ground.  Some people say no subtitles when watching the movie as a fair warning of people buying this DVD, but if you still enjoy your action movies, good fight scenes, and shoots out, plus it being based on a true story then pick this movie up and enjoy an evening with the movie something to drink and maybe some popcorn.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The only movie in the series really worth watching, if you like this and you should I'd look for the Crow tv series also very good and right on par with the J. O'Bar comic series
B0073LWEXK|2.0|couldn't solve it,  I tried several times and had to give up.  The clues didn't help.me at all<br />It lost me
B005LAJ17M|5.0|heard so much about it bought this on sale for $24.99 which is a great price for a season on Blu was great now can't wait for season 2 on Blu
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Wow, what a fast paced, thrilling movie.  I love it from start to finish.  Jeremy Renner was terrific and the story line was creative and kept me involved.  The action was WILD and crazy and I loved the entire movie.  It is quite the ride from start to finish.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|this was great for the 1st appearance of Captain America his origin story was handled so well have watched it over 20 times!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A bit slow to start but fascinating information about zoology interwoven with religion. Life and God are truly remarkable. Courage, hope, friendship, fear, despair, suffering, and love.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|wasn't quite as good as the 1st one but still very good and entertaining was a bonus on ultraviolet too
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This novel is great story about the diversity in high schools. It speaks of almost every situation imaginable and is shown through the perspective of a 16 year old freshman, Charlie. I would recommend this book to young adults due to language and sexual content. Definitely a five star book though
B00129H7VS|5.0|If you love war pictures..you will love Band od Brothers ..Blu-ray or Dvd..its really good and realistic..the making of this cant get any better..
B00000FC5H|4.0|I am very pleased with this CD.  I never like every song on a disc, but I am pleased with this purchase, because It contains all the songs that I like by EW&F, and I feel it was worth the money.
B000L53D4O|5.0|I have this in my daycare and I can't keep the 5 year olds away from it! They use it to chase each other ! Good lord! But the babies that this was intended for love it just as much. It's stable enough for the babies to pull themselves up and it rolls very easily! Definitely recommend this item.
B000W178XO|5.0|What isn't to love about Johnny Cash.  The last song is the best version of this song and so unexpected.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is hard to put it down- I need to limit myself!  I previously had the game on my phone, but it is much easier to play on the Kindle.
B001QD4KH4|5.0|My wife owns this book and it does not leave our coffee table.  We have purchased copies for multiple friends and family members.  Please know this book is for everyone who has eyes!<br /><br />We have had even the least emotional people grow goosebumps as they looked through the book.  I think this is some of the best &#34;gateway art.&#34;  What I mean by that is, this could potentially get people who are not inclined to enjoy art...to ENJOY IT!<br /><br />The hardest part about this country is not being able to see how truly beautiful it is.  I toured throughout the USA and my appreciation for this nation went through the roof.  The landscapes and the people in different regions is shocking and breathtaking.  If you don't have the wonderful chance to do what I did, please purchase this book!
B0050R0XPA|5.0|My kid is verry verry happy whit that lego....i send a Mail to tell this is. For santa gira and is recibe faster ty
B004LROUNG|4.0|It's amazing how 3 people who didn't have a clue can come out on top in the end.  I enjoyed it & could hardly wait to see the outcome.  Especially liked David & his honesty & commitment to his partners even though they had very little credibility.  Would be nice to have more people like him in this crazy world.
B0007TKNII|5.0|It is more than I expected I enjoying very much, the quality is excellent and the sound too.  Have seen three times already/
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I love this app. I use it when I need to wind down from a long day and need to relax or just take a quick 2 minute break to breathe and get my emotions and stress under control at work. I use the longer meditation at night to help me get to sleep and it works like a charm.<br />Easy to use and the voice is very soothing.<br />I would reccomend it to anyone who just wants to relax and unwind in any situation.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle and it only let me see the first 5 stories on my news feed and that was it, no matter how many times I updated it or exited out and went back it was still the same thing. I ended up having to download friend caster which is not the same thing but at least I can see peoples posts they put on Facebook.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down, read it in 2 days! Only complaint is that it ended to soon. I can't wait to read more
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love this CD...he is an amazing musician, not to mention a great kid.  BUY IT!!!!!!  It's worth getting the bonus tracks, too.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter enjoys watching Tinkerbell and has the other 3 movies.  She wanted this one to go with the others.  She loved it and watched it already.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I love the fact that I can watch the original in black and white and my children (who don't like black and white movies) can watch the color version.  The best for all of us...Such a classic!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So much fun especially if you have time to kill.  Was in a doctor's waiting room yesterday and the time flew by.
0761171703|4.0|Thumbs up for anyone interested in dancing, cool pix of people in odd positions, or what the human body can do.
B00338QENI|3.0|I know a whole lot of people love this book and Oprah wants to make a movie out of it and such, but frankly, it was just okay.<br /><br />I want to like it more. The work and dedication that went into this book is impressive, and the writing is good. Skloot is clearly a compassionate person who worked hard to see all sides. And I feel for the Lacks family, God bless them.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just dense or hard to please, I don't know. I feel like I missed something. By the end of the book I basically scratched my head and thought, well, it was okay. No feeling of righteous ire. No sense of anything more than maybe some non-specific cosmic injustice. No feeling like I really learned something life-changing today. Nobody I could point to and say I totally understand where you're coming from, other than maybe the doc who originally figured out how to keep the cells alive, but that's the wrong team, isn't it? No beautiful prose. No grand story. Just, okay.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|This movie was just ok. I did not care for it and my grandson lost interest fast. He is 5 years old.
B0099HUB8Q|4.0|There is a kindness about his writing which is a welcome holiday from everyday life. His respect for others and self-depreciating humour is just a delight.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|I did not care for this movie. I know that it was a spoof but it was stupid. I would not recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|As far as I can see there is no problem. I just plugged it in and let it do it's thing.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|This movie was just ok. I would not watch it again. It was lacking in many ways. Just did not hold my attention.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is ok. It helps pass the time, and you can choose the auto-ending or not, which is nice.  Several variations, too.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Good lyrics, beautiful melodies, strong vocal, inspired stories told through music. Perfect! The four boys from Florida nailed! I strongly recommend it!
B009NW9QE2|5.0|A sweet romantic comedy that lends hope to all the broken hearts out there that find themselves alone for the holidays.
098555780X|5.0|This book is great, from the pictures to the projects. they are all very well laid out. Stormdrane, one of the authors, has a great blog for more ideas and information, even though, they don't seem to mention it in the book.<br /><br />The only thing that could make this better would be to have a selection of colored cords sold with it so you can get started right away, because several of the designs are for two colors.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Quirky and wonderful!  Great cast, wonderful characters, beautiful cinematography!  Highly recommend it! Well worth renting or owning.  I would watch it again!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Other than not receiving a power cable, which was probably noted in the description the controller is great! Textured for better grip!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My 6-yr-old daughter loves getting new pets, feeding them, etc.  So far, everything seems to work well, and there has been no frustration.  We've only had it for 2 days, of course, but she has played it a lot!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless an emotional read that was raw and real.<br /><br />Hopeless was nothing I was expecting. Any time I start a<br />book by this author I go in thinking I know where it's going to go, but end up being wrong, which is a huge plus for me! It doesn't matter what Colleen Hoover writes, if she came out with a fantasy or another contemporary I will not hesitate to read it! Colleen Hoover has a way of writing characters so realistic and so relatable, stories so heartbreaking, yet still moments to make you smile.<br /><br />When Sky meets Holden, everything in her life changes. Secrets she didn't know about herself come out. All she knows about her past is what her adopted mother told her, that she adopted her when she was seven. She doesn't have many memories from before then.<br /><br />There were so many twist and turns in Hopeless. I didn't seen any of them coming. With Holden, I could feel he keeping something from Sky. And for a few chapters I was thinking \\"Is he her long lost brother of something?\\" lol. I just didn't know what he was keeping from Sky. But when the truth really comes out, it leaves me speechless. I had to reread that part because it was so shocking. Colleen Hoover does an amazing job bringing so many emotions into the writing, that it will leave you breathless when you learn the truth. Also I loved when we find out the meaning behind the title, Hopeless. It's not because any of the characters are hopeless or anything along those lines. It was really cute. So don't let the title fool you, none of the characters were hopeless. Sky was so strong through out the whole book.<br /><br />I loved Sky and Holden together. They had great chemistry from the moment they meet, like they've know each other a long time. Holden is there for Sky through everything. Even though they were really amazing together, the thing I didn't like was that they always seem to fix things by having sex. Something would happen and so they decided to have sex and all I can think about is how in the hell can they be in the mood right now! And towards the ending the writing started getting really preachy, where when the book was over, I was glad. I loved more than 70% of Hopeless. And if the writing was consistent and continued they way it was in the beginning this book would have easily gotten five stars.<br /><br />Overall, Hopeless was intense, raw, and beautiful! I dare you not to at least shed one tear during Hopeless. But, Even though this book was really emotional, there were still cute and fun moments. Moments to make you smile. I highly recommend you read this book!k about is how in the hell can they be in the mood right now!

B008FWHGYS|5.0|This is a movie I would watch again and again....it was interesting to the very end...and the photography excellent.<br />Enjoyable.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is fun and I have played this game for years!  It keeps me going!  I got it in a flash!!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Little difficult to manuever between pages but has gotten much better than it was before. SHould have an all check slot to delete instead of having to delete each separately
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Great story, acting, and direction!  If you're a history buff like me, you are draw to the true story of the King Edward's abdication of the throne, and King George's challenge of becoming a public speaker, while overcoming is stammering handicap.  Colin Firth is just amazing in his performance of King George.
B008S80OU2|4.0|BOC still delivers after all these years.  Great guitar riffs are fantastic and I would like to see them in concert doing what they do best, rock.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very fun app to play. Love the game options of classic unlimited or game. No problems I give it a 5 star.<br /><br />,
B004ZNACA6|5.0|I chose this rating because it's the only box set I would want with me if deserted on an island.  Pink Floyd has no peers.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Loved everything about it!! I have watched it several times!  The story was great, the music was great!! Made me laugh too!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|It's a good new tv series. Hopefully it will picked up for another season. The quality of the video is great. I wish it was a little cheaper to buy the entire season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simply amazing. From 4pm to 2:30am I did not put my Kindle down!! I've already downloaded the second book. Amazing.
1556438850|5.0|Do you want to learn how to teach others yoga?  Then this is the book for you.  If you want a book about gardening, then you should look elsewhere.
B000P0J09W|5.0|A childhood favorite of my family. Love this movie. Arrived on time and securely packed. A great family movie. Fun!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is so much easier on the eyes for us blind old people!  in a pinch, I'll still use my iphone, but when home on the couch, this is the new way to do Facebook.
B007AMMZA4|4.0|I had no doubt that another film from Pedro Almodovar would be good. And this film didn't disappoint. It's very eery and it's a film that stays with you long after you watch it. There are parts that are a bit strange and for lack of a better description -- somewhat disturbing. But, all of the scenes and storytelling relates to the subject matter. It's a film about revenge, desperation, dependence and ultimately survival. It's not one you want to miss.<br /><br />A side note: It would have been nice to have been able to rent this film rather than buying it outright. $15 bucks is a bit steep for a one-time view.
B003HE2B9E|5.0|saw the micheal jackson this is it thought she was great. then saw her like several times with alice cooper, she was awesome. the cd is pretty good but she is better live
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This movie isn't only timely, but one that everyone needs to see. It's amazing how many problems go ignored until it is too late.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|As always amazon is awesome! Free 5G which gets you about 250 songs to upload to the cloud. For just $25 a year you get 250,000 songs to upload to the cloud which let's you steam to your computer or tablet.
B002TUETW4|5.0|I was shocked Mr. Jackson was so sharp in this dvd makes the whole thing so sad, such a waste of a life by a dr who never should have had the power over any human
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Worth a dollar rental, but no more than that. Batman seems like a chump in this one who gets his arse kicked every time you turn around. Most of the movie he seems depressed and un-sure of himself and most are glad he is gone.Bane is a joke.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There were so many ups and downs with this book but they were for the most part unexpcted.  I was constatnly trying to figure out what was going on but couldnt quite put my finger on it until it was reveiled.  I hate books that you can write out yourself what is going to happen and 9 times out of 10 you are right but this book was not like this.<br /><br />Holder was such a gentle soul but knew when to have his moments and show a side that he only let Sky into see.<br /><br />Read for yourself because i know most people will love this book!!!<br /><br />GREAT JOB on this one Colleen!!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Thought it was just as funny as the others. Will Smith once again is super funny! Nice how this movie ties the others together.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Hey, it's the Weather Channel.  The app provides good, well-laid-out graphics with all the info you could want.  I have it on all my mobile devices.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This movie might not be for everyone, but if you like history you will love this movie. Gives you a great idea of how things were back during the 20's and 30's.
1884883303|5.0|My dad always likes to price the numerous guitars he has collected over the years, and this is the easiest Christmas present. It is very easy to read and since he is familiar with the layout, he can find his prices right away.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put the books down. Love Anastasia and Christain! Can't wait for these books to hit the big screen as movies!
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Pool Break Pro is an excellent choice if you are looking for a good Pool game to past the time away.  The 3-D graphics are sharp the the controls are easy to learn. there are different choices for other pool games if that is what you prefer, such as: snooker, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, etc.  It even lets you choose the size of the table. Well worth the price paid for this app! Other pool games need not apply.....
0515142247|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it. He is a Jack Reacher fan and was so excited to get to read this.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|My sister loved it! Arrived on time for christmas, All perfect... She was happy. I will look for more dvds for her! &lt;3<br />Thank You Amazon
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mesmerizing story line that gripped this reader from start to finish. Terrific character development.  Word pictures that immersed my mind into the silo and exterior spaces.  Stumbled upon this downloaded classic that deserves a place among the great Sci-fi authors whose printed pages grace the shelves of the bound-works universe.  Thank you Hugh Howey for crafting your gift for the readers of this genre and beyond.  I am now committed to explore more dimensions of your creative efforts.  Bravo!  Standing ovation!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|No nonsense justice! Jack Reacher is about justice any way he can get it done. A exciting story that ends well.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|got it for my daughter but I play it more than her I think! have this game on three devices
B0079XNWQA|1.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Jason Mraz's music. However... I am super annoyed that in order to listen to the cd I have to submit my personal information online. I shouldn't have to hand out my information in order to listen to a cd. This is crap. I haven't even heard the cd because I can't get past the stupid email info that it wants and rejects. Boo.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I would have given this a 5 except I find some of the detailed back round of the &#34;Rival's&#34; families too much.  This is a remarkably researched and well written piece for anyone who is interested in what makes us who we are today as Americans and full of insight into our modern political environment.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I had no to low expectations for this film and so was delighted to find that I had a great time watching it.  The acting was overall quite good but was certainly outdone by the outstanding environments and believable special effects that I've come to expect from Ridley Scott.  The pacing and excitement were wonderful and there are scenes I'll be talking about for days.  The only drawback is it's complete inability to explain itself.  It is quite complex and leaves you feeling like maybe you missed some key bit of information.  It's almost as if Ridley Scott had this great big elaborate world inside his head and just failed to convey it thoroughly.<br /><br />Overall an exciting movie that I would watch again while accepting that I just don't get it.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I am not really used to listening to Bob Marley but when I saw this whole album on sale on Amazon for $1 I grabbed it instantly. I cannot say everyone will like it but being very new to his songs I am really enjoying listening to it. So grab it before it is gone !
1475143389|5.0|What I like most about the book is that everything he wrote about, he listed what college did a study about it to back it up. He puts everything simply, taking you back to basics for lifting/eating correctly depending on what your goals are. In my opinion the book is well written and I get the impression that he genuinely wants everyone to achieve and surpass their fitness goals. Thanks for the information.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is ok. My kids like it, but could have more features offered. Since they are learning, it keeps them busy.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is a must read its filled with a futuristic society, deadly adventure, and an unexpected romance. Once you pick up this book you won't want to ever put it down.
0345505387|2.0|I thought I was buying a novel ...not a comic book. It's been too many years since I've read one. When it said illustrated I didn't realize it would be in comic book format. Too bad..I was really looking forward to more insight on Jamie..Still looking for a sequal to the last Diana Gabaldon Outlander series.
B009EEQO08|5.0|Hands down, my favorite Christmas movie.  You can call it hackneyed, you could say all the pieces fall ever-so-conveniently in place, but isn't that what holiday movies are all about?  It's about heart, about reunions and good friends.  It's just that Die Hard also has explosions and Alan Rickman in one of his best performances.
0316227706|4.0|As a lover of dogs, this is one of the books you cannot simply pass on. Who would have ever thought dogs looked as cute as they do in this book? I certainly did not but it is evident Seth Casteel clearly did. The book takes a greater look into the nature of dogs while they are under the water. One of the most amazing things in the book is the simplicity of the dogs and the profound messages sent through the eyes of these dogs.<br /><br />I had never thought dogs could look this wonderful in the water. one of the things we do as dog lovers is ensure they have a good shower but I doubt any of us ever took the time to take the photographs of these creatures as we make them swim. Seth has done the amazing work for us and I feel this is the best and most informative book I have ever had about dogs.<br /><br />The photos in the book are a classic. Many of us have a problem with taking photos because of the technicalities involved here. However, the professional work in this book will leave the eyes wishing for more. It is until I got to read the book that I found a Christmas present for my friends and family this December. I am confident they are going to enjoy it as much as I did since they are also dog lovers. The photos in the book are not only clear but they are also eye-catching. They are surely going to get any dog lover out there excited.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is silly and sweet and yes, juvenile at times. These are perfect roles for Will Ferrell and Bob Newhart! Zooey Deschanel is charming with an amazing singing voice. There are also a number of entertaining references to classic holiday films. For me, it has an 80's storyline feel, but it works for this family, holiday movie. It's become a must-see for us during the holidays.
B0083Z614S|3.0|I liked the book but I have read better  books. I would like to know why the author wrote this book? I think that the book was OK
B0010T0OCY|5.0|This is a must see if you are a sci-fi fan! Just take note that 1998 doesn't seem so long ago, but the CGI definitely wasn't as sophisticated as it is today. What did I love about this? It's a great story - dark and intricate. The characters are unique and interesting (Sutherland's character has some very strange behaviors). It has a mix of alien intrigue, mind-control (matrix-esque and telekinesis) and good-old good versus evil. Some heavy-hitting actors making some early-in-their-career appearances. It's a fun and interesting watch. If you like it once, watch it again. You'll discover new nuances that make the movie even more special.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so funny! My favorite part of the book is when Greg had to baby sit. I think this book is good for all of my friends! I think this book is really good.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've read all three books in the series, and this movie makes me look forward to the next one. The movie clarifies a part of the first book my son and daughter and I found confusing. Of course, no adaptation of even a relatively simple novel can contain all the elements or sub-plots of the book. But this movie prevents you from asking &#34;Why did they leave out...?&#34;
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It wasn't as bad as people said it was! But I think Ana should get with Taylor he's nice and I think he's capable of love.
B004X4QW42|5.0|A continuation of the life of Ip Man, an incredible martial artist.  The fight scene between donnie yen and sammo hung are epic
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put the kindle down!!! Read It  in like a week !!!=) on to the next book today it was great!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Fantastical! 2D Boy comes through in spades on this gloriously hilarious and adorable physics-based puzzler -- and the soundtrack is amazing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't found a good book in about three months and this has got me going! I was sucked into this book from the second chapter. It intertwines all of my favorite things to read. I would recommend this to everyone. Too bad everyone I know has already read it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny........ enjoyable book.  A turn for Greg that may have been expected but may not have.  Once more Jeff Kinney does a great job keeping kids wanting more. I'm excited for number 8.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So like, I've read this book several times....Never gets old. I absolutely love this book... stunning in many different ways.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is basically a step up from mc 3 you are able to play as Edward page which I think is cool. 1 gun is actually going by its real name (the scar l)  and multiplayer is amazing
B00992CF6W|5.0|If your a fan of the original then you'll love this one. I own the Pc, Xbox, and pocket editions, and I find this version as addicting as the others. Its fun, it's mobile, and it's multiplayer. Fight to survive or get creative. Build underground tunnels, a warm cottage, or whole cities. Have fun in your own way. Needs more updates, but that doesn't keep it from being addicting.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a great surprise.  The first third was very slow and at times I thought I would abandon.....but then the excitement began.  Great story, although, at the end, it dragged on a bit.  I would recommend this book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a great book!!!Can't wait till the next book:)I wonder what Abigail and Rowley will do next....I hope the next book will come out soon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book it was even better than the first one which is hard to believe, because I loved the first one too!!!!!!!!!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Not only does the game totally ROCK, but now, it's portable! My experience with the series is rising greatly now not only because this game is addicting, but it is fun as well! Ninja Kiwi Had made my day!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Sums up all of the original Firefly story line, greatly enjoyed this movie, would highly recomend it to any one that enjoys firefly.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked the book its just that the end just leaves you hanging but overall it's a good book .
B008VBYN80|4.0|Just got started and its a fun free game so far. The constant share my accomplishments is annoying though. Overall one of the more fun games I have played
B0079R8IYW|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure this cover would last. It has a soft comfortable feel to it, but I felt that would compromise it's durability. However, daily use from my 7 year old, has shown me it's very durable. Not a loose stitch.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Soft, comfortable feel to it, yet very durable<br />Cover folds to prop it up, making it a nice stand<br />Pockets on the side, perfect for... well, we don't use them, but they could be handy for those that need them<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Just one. The cover could use a magnetic seal<br /><br />Yes, I would highly recommend this cover. We have a couple other covers, but this is the one that stays on our kindle.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|Christmas present for granddaughter.  She loved it.  Order arrived on time.  ordered rest of step up series.  All were liked
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I will say that it probably needs to be viewed with the subtitles or watched more than once to absorb all the dialogue.  I read the book the next day and that helped.  So I will watch it again once the DVD is released.  With the proper focus, it becomes an almost dreamlike experience.  And if you don't believe  my title, just look at a list of American films released in 2012 and tell me which one even comes close to being this challenging to the viewer (that's what I mean by intelligent).
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Hmmm!  And I thought we were a mismatch. But after reading this book, it's not about being mismatched, it's about understanding the individualized person and what makes them tick. I'm going to encourage my husband to read this book. Total eye opener for me. Now I see what his love language is and can now begin using the suggestions Gary Chapman makes to encourage my husband and to hopefully get the relationship between the two of us moving forward in a positive manner.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am going through Colleen Hoover withdrawl.  I finished Hopeless in an afternoon!  I won't give anything away, but you must read this, Slammed, AND Point of Retreat.  Now.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's even better playing Angry Birds Star Wars on my Kindle Fire because of the bigger screen!!! Now I can see the exploding bad pigs close up!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is very easy to use. I would recommend this app. Perfect app to have on a Kindle. Love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was amazing. That's all I can say. I would recommend this book to any and everyone. Also love Nicholas Sparks. Favorite author.
B00A12VW86|5.0|Well of course I bought these discs out of order.<br />Out of the three, I bought this one first and just loved it!<br /><br />The songwriting is superb, and the musicianship is solid and consistent.<br />I can not believe after all these years that Billie Joe and company continue to write relevant songs with delicious hooks!<br />Tre Cool is drumming like a man possessed. The production is like you are hearing every song first take, and brimming with energy.<br /><br />I had a young guy in my car telling me how Green Day had sold out and no longer had what it takes.<br />After 15 minutes of DOS he was begging for a copy. Don't ever count these guys out.<br />70 million records sold and still counting can't be a mistake.<br /><br />Buy this disc and take a fun drive.<br />You will love the tunes and look forward to the next one out!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was entertaining and imaginative.I could really relate to this series and this book is something to add to self-to-text connection. Overall is was a well put together piece of literature.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the type of game I can enjoy everytime I play.It challenges my mind. I cant play the fast paced due to vision loss.It takes time for me to focus. Thank you...This game is a pleasure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a real tear jerker, especially when Rue died. I barely could keep myself from bawling like a baby. I love the Peetah Katniss combination. They are adorable together. I think ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE should read this book. I couldn't put it down. I've had a great time reading this book, and I hope you will too
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought this mostly because it was only 3.99. I can't believe how good it is for the money. I got turned onto The Lumineers a few months ago. The whole album is really good with a lot of raw guitar and great lyrics.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was incredibly amazing. This coming of age story was a constant pageturner. Full of emotion, life, and vibrancy. A good read, that's for sure
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I tried the Candy Swipe Free first, and, when the time ran out for it, I bought the app.  Candy Swipe is fun, quickly done (since it is timed), and pretty much mindless entertainment.  One can play it when one has just a little time to kill (like standing in line somewhere).  It isn't mentally challenging; it's just addictive and entertaining.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Everything about the Marware case for the Kindle 8.9\\" lives up to my expectations. Having bought one for my original 1st generation Kindle Fire, I knew the Marware quality and  features. Installation (following the instructions) was a snap and the revolving stand is such a bonus with this larger 8.9\\" display (is not something I have in the original Fire cover). I would have liked different color choices, but the purple is slightly muted, not too bright, and I am pleased with it.<br /><br />One thing I noticed immediately, and I'll include as a caution for others, is that the added 12 ounce weight of the cover is very noticeable; with this cover, the nice slim & light (20 ounces) Kindle Fire 8.9\\"  now has combined weight of 2 pounds: heavier and  more bulky. This is NO way reduces my satisfaction; a high quality cover is a must for me. But in case weight is a major concern for others, thought I'd make the comment so no one is disappointed
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excellent deal, for the 4 discs, the movie is awsome for the super hero lovers, special effects and graphics are gorgeous on BluRay
B003J27WFW|5.0|Such a great movie..I've seen it at least five ties and looking forward to watching it again!  A must see for anyone interested in rush at all.
B005P4P966|5.0|For years my friends told me about this show. I put it off because I thought it was just a stupid show the made fun a nerds. But as the same time I was looking for a smart show about nerds. Well, when you have nothing to do you and have money you buy the show. I went out on a lim and got season 1-3 and well to say the least I loved the show. This show is the show I have been looking for. To say the least I love the show. It is funny smart and nerdy.
0316069434|1.0|I look forward to every new Connelly book...especially those featuring Harry Bosch...but this one is simply dreadful.  I have to wonder if he even wrote it. I hope he didn't and that there'll be another one of his jewels coming down the pike.  The dialogue in The Black Box is simplistic and even juvenile.  I kept plugging along thinking maybe it would improve but it never did.  I'm so disappointed and sorry.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Best sleep I have had in a long time. There might be a few tiny bad things about this app such as battery consumption and it's not for everyone but those put aside a useful app is what you got here.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Things keep changing with strange personalities inter-relating in strange ways.  The movie does not stand on its own very well.  It relies greatly on earlier parts of the story.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Alfie Boe has the most amazing voice! I am in love with it! When the whole cast came on stage to sing \\"one day more\\" I almost cried, the music is so beautiful and the singers are so talented. I was surprised how good Nick Jonas was but I thought he was great at Marias. But Alfie Boe made the whole show for me.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I never read the books, so I was not knowing what to expect.  It was very entertaining.  The set up for the next one was a little heavy-handed, but I can't say that I'm surprised.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|With offering of season1 , season2 and the complete final season , we made the mistake of thinking this was a third season and a finale to season 1 - NOT! In fact we see no differnce in season2 and the final season and wonder why its been offered as a seperate product.
B009MO5960|4.0|More action, more visual effects and it's humanity's last stand in the fifth \\"Resident Evil\\" film, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\".<br /><br />Directed and written by Paul W.S. Anderson (\\"Mortal Kombat\\", \\"Death Race\\", \\"The Three Musketeers\\", \\"Resident Evil\\"), the fifth film would take a different approach from previous films by tying loose ends with past characters but also focusing on creating a film primarily for 3D.  And like the previous \\"Resident Evil\\" films, the \\"Retribution\\" would go on to make over $221 million in the box office.<br /><br />Not surprising since the \\"Biohazard\\"/\\"Resident Evil\\" video games have been quite popular since 1996 and there seems to be no stopping this juggernaut franchise to end anytime soon.  That goes the same with its live action film series which is loosely-based on the video games.<br /><br />And no matter how film critics respond, the audience still turn out for the films and with \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" which was shown in theaters in 3D, once again the film continues to show that fans and audiences still love the action-driven series.  And to make sure there is a connection between the films, producer/writer Paul W.S. Anderson (\\"Death Race\\" films, AVP: Alien vs. Predator\\") returns as director.  Glen MacPherson (\\"Rambo\\", The Final Destination\\", \\"Romeo Must Die\\") is director of photography and music is by tomandandy (\\"Natural Born Killers\\", \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\", \\"The Rules of Attraction\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film features awesome contrast, amazing detail with natural skin tones, black levels are nice and deep.  The film is vibrant and looks very impressive on Blu-ray.  From Milla Jovovich's blue eyes to the detail of the zombies and monsters is fantastic!<br /><br />By watching this fourth film, it appears that Paul W.S. Anderson may have wanted to include a lot of the video game elements, especially the horrific characters to this film.  In fact, the Umbrella Japanese soldiers looked as if they were inspired by the anime series \\"Jin-Roh\\".  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the overall look of the film especially how they improved the look of the horrific characters and the detail they put into those characters.  From the things coming out of the zombie's mouth or the various zombie monsters that are featured throughout the film, everything looked great for this film, the visual effects were amazing and looked great on Blu-ray!<br /><br />It's important to note that there is a Blu-ray 3D version of \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" available.  If you have a 3D-enabled Blu-ray player and TV, you may want to check out the 3D Blu-ray release of \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\".<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />When it comes to the \\"Resident Evil\\" film series, I felt that \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is the film that sounds the best and has a lossless soundtrack that is immersive. Presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital  and comes with an English - Audio Description Track, the lossless soundtrack for \\"Retribution\\" is fantastic!<br /><br />LFE is used for explosions, surround channels are well utilized for the many action scenes in the film but how it uses ambiance and also directional sounds on the surround channels.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you enjoyed the action-paced style of \\"\\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" and \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\", you're going to enjoy \\"Retribution\\" as this film is full of action-sequences that just keeps going and going and literally, this is a lossless soundtrack that really does take advantage of all channels in your home theater.  I was impressed!<br /><br />You can expect bullets whizzing, hitting and flying everywhere through your surround channels, explosions and booms, sword cutting and a nice touch of LFE and it's continuous.  There is so much action in this film that it's literally designed for the audiophile in mind.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" comes with the following special feature:<br /><br />  Project Alice - This feature allows you to know more about the various characters featured in \\"Retribution\\" as well as the monsters and more!<br />  Audio Commentary 1 - Featuring audio commentary with writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson, Milla Jovovich and Boris Kodjoe.<br />  Audio Commentary 2 - Featuring audio commentary with writer/director Paul W. S.

Anderson and producers discuss the making of the fifth film.<br />  Evolving Alice - (6:50) Milla Jovovich and crew talking about how Alice has evolved in the last decade.<br />  Resident Evil: Reunion - (9:42) A featurette about the return of past characters from previous \\"Resident Evil\\" films.<br />  \\"Design & Build - The World of Resident Evil: Retribution - (9:11)  A featurette on the visual effects and production design of the film.<br />  Drop (Un) Dead: The Creatures of Retribution - (6:58) A feauturette on the visual effects and make-up effects for the film.<br />  Resident Stuntment - (6:17) Nick Powell, stunt coordinator discusses how this film features different stunts because it was filmed in 3D and because its in 3D, the real actors had to do their fight scenes.<br />  Code: Mika - (5:34) Japanese pop star Mika Nakashima talks about working with Milla Jovovich and filming her scene.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tables or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to \\"Resident Evil\\", I'm a hardcore fan of the video game series.  Owning nearly ever game that has been released since 1996 but when it came to the first film, I admit that at first, I wasn't digging it at all. I disliked how much of a departure the film was to the video games.  Granted, things always have to change between video game and movie adaptations but the problem was its screenplay. It was too different from what I was accustomed to.<br /><br />But then came \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" and I really enjoyed the film and how it had elements of \\"Resident Evil 2″ (video game) incorporated to the film.  But for some reason, \\"Resident Evil: Extinction\\" felt like it was a step back.  And with the fourth film,  \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" was a mixed bag.<br /><br />My main criticism was that although the visual effects were great, the action was focused on too much that the film really didn't have much of a storyline.<br /><br />Here we are now with the fifth film \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" and I figured that for filmmaker Paul W.S. Anderson, if the films were popcorn action films, people keep coming back.  Why deviate from that?<br /><br />And sure enough, this fifth film was all visual effects, showcasing fight choreography that looked amazing and action that was non-stop.  Sure, there were breaks to fit in a storyline but as the film was kicking off, for the first 20 or so minutes, I was wondering if there was going to be much dialogue.<br /><br />But for what it's worth, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" delivers in surprises and twists.  Not only do the past cast members from a films return but also the introduction of \\"Resident Evil\\" favorites, Leon S. Kennedy (which Johann Urb fit the look of Leon quite well) and Chinese actress Li Bingbing as the sexy Ada Wong.<br /><br />But while we saw the return of Jill Valentine (which fans have been waiting for) and even the return of Rain, Luther and Albert Wesker, the film forgot about Clair Redfield (portrayed by Ali Larter), K-Mart (portrayed by Spencer Locke) and Chris Redfield (portrayed by Wentworth Miller).  It felt weird because all four were seen on the same freighter at the end of \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" and while a clip from the last film was shown, no sign of any of them in this film. So, maybe they will show up in the next \\"Resident Evil\\" film.<br /><br />And while I'm not a big fan of popcorn action films that focus on too much action and not enough story, I did enjoy \\"Resident Evil: Retribution because of the inclusion of the new characters.  Although, I'm not sure about how I feel of this clone storyline (since it was never part of the original video games), Paul W.S. Anderson leaves viewers with an intriguing teaser at the end of the film that makes me look forward to sixth films.  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure if there is any finale to \\"Resident Evil\\",  like its video game counterpart, as long as the series continues to make money, you can expect more RE films in the near future.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" looks fantastic in HD!  The detail is amazing but there are a lot of use of green screen and visual effects in order to make this film more exciting in 3D.  The lossless audio for this film is also immersive and sounds fantastic in HD and there are plenty of special features included on the Blu-ray release as well.  I was surprised to learn how things have changed when it comes to stuntwork when it comes to filming in 3D.  Because in order to make things look realistic, actors will need to actually hit and not miss during their fighting scenes.<br /><br />Actress Milla Jovovich explained how much training she had for many action films that she had starred in and how she was trained to miss during a fight scene, but this is the first time where she had to hit the people she was fighting because it had to look good in 3D and it was difficult for her.  Also, there is a scene with a car running through a truck and catching on fire.  I thought that would be done by CG but Anderson wanted to shoot an actual vehicle catching on fire during an actual jump through a truckbed.<br /><br />So, director Paul W.S. Anderson and the producers really went all out in making this fifth film and its action scenes bigger and better and while the film looks a bit to CG for me, since a lot of it does take place inside an Umbrella base, there was part of me that was still longing for the good balance of storyline and action as seen in the second and third films.  But once again, as long as people are still coming out for this film, even if it's now more for its popcorn action and 3D effects, I guess for what its all worth, if that was the goal, they succeeded.<br /><br />Again, just a reminder that this film is also being released on Blu-ray 3D, so if you have the hardware to showcase 3D, definitely go for it!  Otherwise, this Blu-ray release is solid and fans of the film series who love action, zombies, monsters and the action scenes that \\"Resident Evil\\" films are known for will enjoy this film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" is an exciting popcorn action film that delivers in special effects and continuous action.  The film may not be known for a deep or involving plot and its similarities to the video games are non-existent aside from character names or titles, but this fifth film was quite fun because of its wild action and the return of many past characters from the \\"Resident Evil\\" films.  And as for the Blu-ray release, awesome picture quality, fantastic lossless audio and many special features makes this film worth owning in HD if you are fan of the film series!scene.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tables or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to \\"Resident Evil\\", I'm a hardcore fan of the video game series.

1416550550|5.0|A well written novel with lots of twists and turns.  Thoroughly enjoyed reading it and good for book clubs. Recommend.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I find it hard to rate this because I bought it for a teenager thinking he would enjoy classic heavy metal but when he opened it Christmas day he didn't want it and gave it back to me still sealed. The rating I give the seller is 110%, got the item shipped to me right away and it was as described.
1926778103|4.0|I'd like to start by saying that the art for this game is fantastic. I love Joe Madureira's intricate and dynamic art style. This book is surprisingly thick and chock full of really cool drawings, including angels and demons, weapons and environments, cover illustrations and even logo designs.<br /><br />Now, I've read previous reviews about the binding. I'm pretty careful with handling my books, and keeping them in a relatively new condition as I usually receive them. Once I got the Art of Darksiders, I took extra precautions not to rough it up from the start. Still, the glue came away in one day and the pages are barely kept together.<br /><br />That aside, this is a great addition to my art book collection. I eagerly await the Art of Darksiders 2.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|light and laughable read for the first 3/4s of the book. it does start to drag a bit toward the end, but the author pulls it together and wraps it up without too much fuss. not great, but pretty damn good.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|the game overall was fun but the premise is wierd.  there was no way to skip the puzzles so if you didn't solve it you had to do the whole level again.  Also I expected xmas music.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Not what my wife expected when she ordered it. She thought it was going to be a love story but turned out to be falling out of love and a lack of comunication. Tommy Lee Jones is much better in action type movies.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|So fun and educational.  I always wanted to play the piano and can amuse myself for hours with this game.  Kids love it also.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Keanu does great because he's Keanu playing a surfer dude--not hard for him to act natural at all! Swayze steals Keanu's thunder in this one though for sure.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I choose this rating because the music is great, its different and better than that miley cryus and justin beiber music. The Black keys is always a good artist to choose when in doubt, I have never been unsatisfied =)
B0009A40ES|4.0|Even by today's standards this film seems like it pushed so many boundaries on so many levels. Bale gives one of his best performances ever.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Very tight arrangements and clever lyrics: all of the remarkable qualities of a Donald Fagen effort. Certainly worth a listen.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Thumbnail<br />Vbhnbjjhcjjb<br />Advantage<br />Vandenberg<br />Srgbbsrvbbzdgnsdvn<br /><br />Advantage<br />Nbgbg<br /><br />G<br />BBC<br />Beach<br />Dot net income for the time that you have any questions about the same time as the same
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|What else would you expect from Seth MacFarlane. Great cast with an unbelievably realistic live teddy bear. The scene with the hookers on the couch with Ted had me laughing so hard my face hurt. What can I say, I love potty humor.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Got this movie for my daughter, who loves Howl's Moving Castle and similar types of movies.  It's a good one!
B005LAIHCW|3.0|I'm in a kind of no mans land with this one. On one hand, it's a little plain. On the other, that may be a nice reprieve from the over the top gore, torture and hyper sexual romps that pass as horror or suspense. The story is good, albeit not perfect. Its a little predictable but its easy to watch. Its not a bad movie. Its not a great movie. Its just kinda there. Enjoy it, just go with it and don't expect too much and you'll be fine.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Not sure why this series had to ever end. It was the best tv series and series finale I've ever seen.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has never felt infinite.<br /><br />Everyone should feel this way.<br /><br />Even if you don't believe in infinity.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a great show if you want a little of everything... Love, friendship and lots of laughs! Some of it was corny but in a way that made it even more funny. Worth watching!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good read. Enjoyed this book very much. Will be reading the others too.<br />Ham and cheese makes a good sandwich.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Graphic is good and story line is good. Not just another bejewel game. The game is similar to jewel game
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am already 4 books past this one...and can't remember the story line...but know it was another great Connelley book!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the best alarm app I have found.  easy to use and works consistently.  I highly recommend it to e ergone.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|got this as the free app of the day. love it. tons of fun and runs great on my kindle fire. looks really nice too. I would say this game is definately worth the 4.99. it is obivous the developers put a lot of work into it. :)
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|this movie is perfect guy humor, so funny and its great to finally have a guy comedy that's hilarious and so relate-able. its great!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Una pel&iacute;cula que todo amante de las pel&iacute;culas rom&aacute;nticas debe tener en su colecci&oacute;n, los actores son excelentes y la historia es maravillosa.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|This app lives up to it's name, it's as close to perfect as you can get.  I used this to import 4 gigs of .cbr comic files into the Kindle Fire.  Works awesome in landscape mode, and the screen is big enough to to use in normal frame mode.  fast and simple, perfect.
B0086700CM|1.0|no matter how you swipe to initiate a jump, he does not respond correctly.it's free so try it...why not, but for me this game is useless.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much fun. i check in a few times a day. The challenges keep coming. cant hurt to download and try it!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|At first you think it's a typical Vegas nightmare weekend....  However, love and persistence wins all. Decent story line, with some twists that set you on fire
B0001I562I|3.0|we all love fantasy. Could stimulate future scientist/engineers. Plays on Einstein's special theory of reletivity and it's effects on time when near light speed is used.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the show and i can watch it over and over again, while i wait for the new season.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|Teen action adventure with character building concepts, especially in goal setting, hard work and achievment. We all like heros, even from space.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is perhaps one of the most intriguing books I have ever read!!!! Simply because Charlie looks at life from an innocent outside view. He is a character that is both incredibly fragile and yet infinitely strong. Charlie's letters are ones that will have you on his side from beginning to end. A must read.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|The first move of the  trilogy follows the original novel very well. I read the book in two days,(very unusual for me), this movie did not dissapoint me. The other two movies in the group also do the trick of making you look behind you everywhere you go for days after viewing.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am a sucker for a happy ending, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  But the rest of the book/story is great and kept me on the edge of my seat for 2 days of great reading!  Thank you Stephen.
B004FEJ3VY|1.0|I bought this for my 6 yr old son for Xmas. When he opened it and wanted to Transform it to the Optimus Prime truck, it was a nightmare after christmas!  I am an engineer and it was even frustrating for me to convert it back.  The directions are designed for visual only and no written instructions.  If it didn't cost me more than I paid for it to return to Amazon I would!!  Save your money!!! So Not Worth it!!
B00004CWTY|5.0|This is an especially good item to have in any Michael Jackson collector's items! I was lucky to find it new, sealed, and at an affordable price! Amazon has deals like that! The graphics are clear and the sound is good. Need I say more?
B009CPJHY4|4.0|An entertaining look at aging.  Some romance, some health issues, and some strife all linked together with a feel good ending.  The actors are all on top of their game.
B004498KPU|5.0|This item is AWESOME! It has about 42 videos on it and all are skillfully digitally-mastered and clear! My family was singing and dancing along with Michael and great family time and memories were enjoyed! Michael Jackson has that magical quality that brings people together like that. Imagine being glued to your seat for that long and not being uncomfortable or tired! This was such a great buy that I got another for my personal library! OMG! A great price could be found with a litle searching too! Sometimes various sellers offer different prices so hunt around on the pictures displayed on the bottom of the Amazon web page or search it in the engine and compare various dealers' prices for a better deal! Have fun!!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|If you are looking for high quality headphones to use at home, these are awesome and extremely comfortable  I haven't found headphones with a better sound than these. I extremely recommend them!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Works great.  I like the controls and appearance.  I like it better than windows media player.  You have done a good job on this one.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I chose this rating because my daughter-in-law is a musician, sings in several choirs, some with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and dearly loved the movie West Side Story.  She really wanted this 50th Anniversary Edition for a keepsake.  It pleased her to receive it, so that made us happy too.  I recommend it to anyone who loved this movie, or anyone who never did get to see it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works great on my tablet  .  Helped tremendously in relocating my modem for best overall wifi reception.  No problems at all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I honestly couldn't put it down, this book had lots of unexpected surprises and twists. I can't wait to read Flynn's other books now!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is simply the best Christmas movie ever, Its so funny from beginning to end ! I love the Griswold's
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I've been a huge Muse fan for years now, and own just about every album with the exception a of a few B-sides. The 2nd Law rips open as opposed to what I felt was a much more pop-centric, Resistance album. Though a bit fragmented, the first five tracks set up a nice groove and really bring back Muse's true rock style. The second half of the album becomes much more diverse and much quieter. I wasn't a big fan of most of these latter tracks when I first listened to the album, but some of them have grown on me. Chris Wolstenholm (their bassist) adds some new depth by taking over the lead vocals in the last two non-symphonic tracks. He has a good voice, though it sort of loses the true Muse &#34;vibe&#34;.<br />Overall a fun album worth listening to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest!  So many ideals and so much variety.  I have tried several recipes and shared some of the cleaning tips found on this site.
B00ABA1OP4|1.0|I can watch the EU version, the video quality is very bad, worst blu-ray I ever seen.<br />DVD's upscaled looks better.<br />Only last 3 videos have decent quality \\"Main Land\\" and both verions of \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\"<br />\\"Pussy\\" is the censored version<br />Some people receive their pack with two equal disk insted Disc 1 and Disc 2.<br /><br />Please read the revies at http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B00ABA1OP4/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1 before order it.<br /><br />Dont waste your money!
1592332803|5.0|Like her Vegetarian Food For Thought podcasts, Colleen's cookbooks are informative and fascinating.  Joy of Vegan Baking is full of good recipes and great information -- everything from advice on how to get a loaf of bread to turn out right to a \\"Defending Desserts\\"  which examines the etymology of the word \\"dessert\\".  This is why we love Colleen.  She is a vast treasure house of knowledge who only gets better as she ages.  She's like Martha Stewart, if only Martha had a genius level IQ and the compassion of the Buddha.  Vegan Baking was my introduction to Colleen's fabulous cookbooks, which include Color Me Vegan and The Vegan Table. [[ASIN:1592333745 The Vegan Table: 200 Unforgettable Recipes for Entertaining Every Guest at Every Occasion]]<br /><br />Colleen never fails to provide good recipes.  I have made the chocolate chip cookies from Joy of Vegan Baking many times, as well as oatmeal cookies, lemon bars, cornbread, and soft pretzels, among others.  Yes, her recipes often call for Earth Balance, Ener-G egg replacer, and refined sugar, but she also includes entire pages and detailed spreads on how to substitute for eggs and sweeteners.  Colleen assumes her readers have a level of intelligence, adaptability, and creativity that negative reviewers may be frankly lacking.  The point of Colleen's Joy of Vegan Baking (I think) is to show that old favorites that once contained dairy and eggs do not need to.  Take rugelach, an Eastern European delicacy that I remember at every gathering from growing up in the Midwest.  Rugelach are little crescent rolls stuffed with cinnamon and walnuts.  They are represented in Joy of Vegan Baking without the usual capitulation to animal secretion products.  The same goes for baklava, hot chocolate, apple and cherry pies, cinnamon coffee cake, pumpkin cheesecake, well, you get the point.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with Joy of Vegan Baking is my desire to constantly make and eat decadent vegan desserts contained within the book.  Colleen's cookbooks are fantastic, I often feel like making her recipes are like having a trusted friend in the room while I bake, even thought I don't know her personally.  I have been vegan almost three years and Colleen, whether in the form of books or her podcasts, has supported me every step of the way as I have made a moral and conscious choice not to eat animals or their secretions.  Joy of Vegan Baking is a stepping stone, just as veggie meats like the ones made by Gardein are stepping stones upon the vegan path.  As a former white bread meat eating Midwesterner, I appreciate Joy of Vegan Baking for its transitional recipes that help sell the vegan choice to otherwise stubborn meat eaters among my friends and family who don't want to give up chocolate chip cookies and cream cheese blintzes.  My preferences slowly changed from needing to eat an ice cream sandwich once a day when I ate meat to my current cravings for unsweetened grapefruit.  My meat-eating relatives and friends are squarely in the ice cream sandwich phase.  This is why Joy of Vegan Baking remains valuable to me even as my diet becomes focused on whole, raw vegetables and fruits.  I now use its recipes as outreach to others when at first, I mainly stuffed Colleen's cookies and cakes down my own face.book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you get passed the sex scenes .. this book is beautiful and relatable to any who have experienced heart break
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I was disappointed in the whole story line and somewhat absurd plot. I thought at times I was reading a Vincel Flynn novel. I expected more about our favorite FBI agent using his incredible skills and not becoming a super hero. I also wanted our favorite NYPD lt. to be more involved. I will still read the next one.Thanks<br />Dan C.
1419705849|5.0|My son loved this book he is 10 years old read the whole thing before setting it down now I need to find another book for him
B0018PH3L0|5.0|A classic western.  Great scenery and all the actors were great.  A must have for any collector of classic westerns
0064430170|5.0|Read this book to my baby who is still in utero. I love the simple story and hope she will too!
B008N1V11U|1.0|This game really doesn't work on Kindle Fire. It simply crashes after a few seconds of gameplay. This game was an impulse buy and boy do I feel burned. I will NEVER again buy kindle apps unless I see them working elsewhere first. I know it was just a few dollars, but as there is no way to refund it or redress my disappointment I don't see another way to keep developers from making programs that simply do not work properly on the platform on which they can be purchased. :( Bummer, Batman licensing people, bummer.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The update that occured today, went a long way to fixing a lot of the issues this app had. Bigger messages screen, full home feed, pictures load faster, no more tiny links or comments to misclick.<br />Havent tried everything yet but so far a vast improvement.
B003L77GG0|3.0|The 10th and last season of Smallville was nowhere near the level of the 9th one and that was too bad. Still, it was very enjoyable, with some great classics like  &#34; Homecoming &#34;,  &#34; Lazarus &#34;, &#34; Abandoned &#34; and the best of the lot  &#34; Booster &#34;. Those episodes were among the best of the series. But there were some awful ones too. &#34; Isis &#34;, &#34; Harvest &#34;  and the lame  &#34; Fotune &#34; comes to mind. The finale was okay. I was deceived that the Darkseid plot line was kind of put on the back burner for the coming of age of Clark and the series's finale. There was so much to be done here! After all, the greatest vilain of all-time of the DC universe was on board! I guess it was just not meant to be! Maybe if they had not wasted 5-6 years of the show on Lana Lang...<br /><br />Ah well, that's life, I guess! Still, all in all, very enjoyable. Just not as good as the 9th season. Enjoyed!<br /><br />Concerning the S & H, thanks for everything! The delivery was in time and in perfect order. Really appreciated the professionalism and the diligence of your company. Impeccable! Thanks again!
B00004YA66|4.0|This movie has great suspense a few shockers but very good.  I had my husband watch and he thought he wouldn't like it but he enjoyed it.
B005R32L66|2.0|Would not send video from my nexus7 , only audio from tablet. Was able to see video and hear audio from other party.
0765350386|1.0|I couldn't get through the first chapter. A BIG disappointment!!!! The story was trite and the magic was forced and gimmicky!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed it! Read the whole thing in a couple sittings. Easy, fun read. Would recommend to a friend.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love this case for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;! Keeps it safe and makes it easier to hold when using.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book it was a great addition to the diary of a wimpy kid series this will definitely be a huge seller
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! Easy to play, really occupies your time. Definitely recommend this game. Really fun.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have the premium membership. This makes it so easy to have complicated passwords saved across multiple devices. I try to make the passwords as long as possible. They come out with new features often.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I LOVe IT! The graphics on this game is amazing.  I got it the day of Christmas when it was free, I'm so glad I saw it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|if you are a tom clancy fan you will love this outing.  all the folks you have grown to love come back again in a  lightning fast page turning thriller  that dosent disappoint.  be prepared for  a wild ride
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I purchased this off of other reviews. And I wasn't disappointed. Pure and simple its entertainment! Anybody who reads anything else<br />into it doesn't get it. A little twist of the vampire theme with a bad ass ax. I enjoyed it. If you're looking for an escape from reality for<br />105 minutes and you have some vampire hungry kids, go for it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|wow  vince flynn  gives us another action packed  thrill ride that is hard to put down.  enjoyed  the action and plot  not a dul minute.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|so many songs for so little money. Love how it spans the range of the stones carreer. cant wait to see them again
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Best ever. Love the music. Everyone sounds awesome. I can listen to this and have tears in my eyes in seconds. Songs filled with raw emotion and lyrics that send chills to your bones.  Thanks for the great mp3 price!!@
B0041OT9W6|5.0|A wonderful expression of an emerging teenager finding her voice. I laughed and I cried, re living my own turmoils when I was no longer a child, but not yet grown up. Anne, and the world she knew, belong to the ages; but her heart and feelings belong to us all. She accomplished her desire of being a writer, and to be sure,  she does live on after her death. I recommend this to everyone that has a heart and an inner voice.<br />@
B009KS4XRO|5.0|fun and entertaining<br />something the whole family can play<br /> you can sign in under your Facebook name or just as a guest
B009LRE040|4.0|I liked Nolan's interpretation of Batman since 'Begins'.  I really liked the fact that he kept the character and movies grounded in reality. Everything is completely plausible and possible and believable.  This is one of the more solid trilogies that I have witnessed.
B000654YS8|5.0|This is truly great guitar playing----all I can do is shake my head and smile.....  :-)  How does anyone acquire such skill?
B007R3AZNK|4.0|The more I listen to this the more I like it. Joe shows more versatility with each new album. Lonely Town Lonely Street is my favorite track.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This app is very much like playing the actual game. Its fun and engaging. My kids absolutely love to play it !!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|great book that keeps you reading  & turning pages. recommend to all who like reading Clancy. Looking forward to more books that encompass the Ryans!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great item just as described, fast shipping! Super funny movie! I gave this as a stocking stuffer and my fiance laughed non stop through the entire movie.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is the best documentary I've ever seen; such an eye opener! I recommend everyone watching this video. More people need to become aware about these things.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|i can't find a way to take a picture other than of myself. apparantly that's all it's meant to do. i wanted to use it as a camera...
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Ich mag die funktionen von battery hd pro . Ganz besonders gut gef&auml;llt mir die m&ouml;glichkeit sich den akku zustand w&auml;hrend des ladens oder auch entladens verbal ansagen zu lassen . Das kann ich dann sehr sch&ouml;n einrichten und ich werde erinnert dass mein smartphone voll geladen ist . Sehr sch&ouml;n und die punkte wann er mir das mitteilt kann ich ganz frei w&auml;hlen in 5 prozent schritten , toll !
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Have been looking for this video since I saw the movie.  Something to keep for prosperity and Afican American history.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I rank this movie with Notebook and P.S. I love you. It's a story that just about any girl wants to have happen (not the forgetting your husband part) - a man fighting with every ounce for you to remember him! If you haven't seen it, don't think twice. It's worth every penny to see.
6305128952|5.0|I of course had seen this in theaters when it first came out.  But after watching the BUCK documentary I had to watch it again!  Plus I like anything Robert Redford!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Cute movie - had me cracking up throughout the whole thing! Justin Timberlake does a good job despite his boy band past... The story is typical, but the humor is what won me over.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This is a great game that is similar to cat and mouse puzzle games from a while back. This seems to be a nice port of this game, and I find it to be very entertaining. The goal is to solve the puzzle without getting eaten, which requires helping the mouse get to the rocket to escape, avoiding various obstacles along the way. Very good and entertaining, just as I expect from Sega.
0345479092|5.0|This book is amazing!  Aside from reading books and filtering through advice from friends and family I had no experience with babies until I had my first child three months ago.  Someone at work strongly recommended this book and, for me, it has been a life saver.  I went from rocking, walking, singing and humming my newborn to sleep to teaching him how to fall asleep by himself in one day.  What a life changer!  This book taught me to act now the way I want to be acting months or years from now.  Teaching independence, as the book suggests, led to a happier baby and much more relaxed parents.  Now I snuggle and rock him just because (and when) I want to not because he won't sleep unless I do :-)  Following the \\"EASY\\" schedule really helps determine why he is crying.  The descriptions of different cries and body language helped as well.  Once I was able to determine why he was crying the pacifier became a non-issue.  My baby had some weight gain issues when I tried following the breast feeding recommendations, but every baby and mother is different.  Overall, I found this book to be an invaluable resource!
034580404X|5.0|I only read 1/2 of the first book, I am too old for this kind of stuff.............gave it to a neice who is enjoying it just fine
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|True love really does conquer all! Hopefully a guy like Holder exists somewhere out there. So much passion and truth. I loved this book and want EVERYONE to read it!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Great songs. Great voice. I really liked it. Good job Taylor Swift. I recommend the CD very much. :) :)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Can't view but a few news feeds.  Very poor response from all the requests to get this repaired.  This is affecting the quality of your kindle fire hd product.  very disappointed in my kindle purchase.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|This album is my oasis. Can let it play through countlessly without noticing that's replayed. Perfect for road trips/long commutes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible! I love everything about it! It is definitely one of my favorites! Suzanne Collins is a literary genius!
0143039881|5.0|My professor had our class read Eichmann in Jerusalem after reading Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism, which was beneficial in understanding Arendt's logic in Eichmann. It also allowed us to reap the benefits of understanding totalitarianism on both an individual level, and on a massive scale.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi<br />I can see why they made a movie from this book. You have to read it to see what this tiger is about, but there is more to the story than that.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This has become my main source for seeing what the weather will be.  Great app to have and easy to use.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I've been wanting this for quite some time now, due to the advertised benifits of being able to play in a smaller space. Well, I got this for Christmas and I was so excited to put it to use, so I did. Well at first the set up instructions were just mainly pictures with no real eplination and it seemed very buggy at first. They give you this plastic sheilding to put between the Kinect and the Zoom and for some reason all it did was cause the device to read me and sence my motions very glitchy like. It doesn't even stick that well either, I had my sensor all clean and ready to go, but it barely stayed on. After some frustration, I removed the plastic insert and the sensor read my moves WAY better, but the playing space did not change. I still had to stand just as far back as before and it did not help with my playing space. So, not so happy about the product.
B005XLN97M|5.0|mad a great Christmas present for my niece she loved it and liked to choke me with hugs and kisses so well worth the money
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Me Befor You by Jojo Moyes is a very good read i recommend it. It has you asking your self what would you do.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a great book for the bech or light read to enjoy. I love to read books for fun not to be bogged down. So this fit right in that catagory.
030758836X|4.0|One of the quickest reads of all time. Full of twists and turns, and even more twists, Gillian Flynn has crafted a crew of clever, motivated and maddeningly love-to-hate characters. I literally could not put this book down. It unfolds brilliantly, and will keep you guessing until the last page.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great album from start to finish! Distinctive, catchy sound. Looking forward to their future work and to seeing them perform live.
0307463745|5.0|A great book that I really enjoyed reading.  It was very similar to their first book, which was a bit disappointing.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|This app is not much different in quality than the office viewer which comes with the Android Os. You can do more than view, but my experience, it still cannot<br /> preserve the original documents made in the Microsoft programs.  In fact graphics in PowerPoint dissappear on this moble app.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I didn't realize how different this would be from the movie. There were only about 6 aspects that were even the same. It was a very interesting read and I really enjoyed it. Highly recommended to those who have seen the movie. (And to those who haven't)
B00006EXCC|5.0|I think Aftermath was one of the under-rated Stones albums in the 60's.<br />The UK version is clean, clear, and a bit more bluesy than the US release.<br />Highly recommend it.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|this is the one cd i wanted to get this year and i got it.  i was glad to see i could download it from amazon for a lot less than i would have had to spend in the store.  that allowed me to purchase other cd downloads as well.!
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Story could be better. With such cute character and her three little brothers, I thought the story line could have been better. I mean what kid doesn't wish they could cast a spell on their parents to make them see it through their (the kids) eyes, right!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I purchased this as a Lightning Deal and was very happy with the price.  It's the Alien movies on Blu-Ray - that makes it pretty awesome!!  Anyone buying this is either a fan or is buying it for a fan so I don't think any &#34;review&#34;  or synopsis of the movie is necessary but suffice it to say if you're in one of those two categories you (or the person you're buying it for) will be very happy!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Love this movie. If you love Avengers and haven't seen this it is well worth the watch. One of my favorite superhero movies, all time!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Play was fine, but I had a game that I could not win, and wanted to end.  There didn't seem to be a one click way to do that.  Otherwise, game played fine, nice options, simple solitaire.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|A really cool and fun book I found not put it down<br />I have read it at least 5 times
B00914JWSW|2.0|I didn't really care for the choice of songs. I like the musical arrangements, and her voice is still amazing.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|HOOKS UP TO PC AND DOWNLOADS INFO FAST. GREAT PRODUCT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.<br />THANK SO MUCH AMAZON.COM FOR THIS ATTACHMENT!
B005LAII62|5.0|A grand addition to my Grand Children's collection of DVD's.Fun for all of us to find new things we missed the first time.
B009DH2PP4|4.0|This book is a good introduction to home brewing and I look forward to try some of the beer recipes in it.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|One of the best driving games. And it is a good game because of the creative Shenzhen vs I've did hank Janis
1400049628|4.0|Loved it. Still a lot of the information is common sense. Still a very good read. There is info that everyone should know.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I got this game for the Chrismas Free app of the Day, but I already owned it for PC from Steam. It is a fun building game that makes you think, and then try to go back to optimize.
0060531053|3.0|Although it is fascinating to find out about the history of brewing, I had thought that this book would be more about estimating and making new batches andrecipes.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|It was really strange, but fun.  It was sort of surreal, similar to a Tarantino movie.<br />We were surprised to see Matthew M. in such a role.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|My 10 year old granddaughter is totally enamored with this DVD. She has watched it twice in one day. She is as happy with it as she is with some of her toys.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|in that everytime you &quot;die&quot; you have to completely restart the level. And why do you have to go to Facebook to find hints??  Seriously, that is so annoying. I give you stars for what is a brilliant and artistically innovative game, but can't give five because of these really, really annoying aspects!
B002ZG9774|5.0|MY granddaughter loves this DVD and had watched it many times. She just cannot get enough of it. I know she will enjoy it for a long time to come.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|If you give this book more than one star than maybe you don't know how to read.<br /><br />But then you have to well read to understand any of it because Mr. Chbosky refers to a million other books (The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, etc) to explain his points for him.<br /><br />Lazy writing.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It was pretty funny but ended up actually being somewhat sad. I was expecting the usual Seth McFarland film/show just humor nothing else. It was a good movie just not what I was expecting.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Did not hold the same story line as book one.  Several scenes that did not add to the story...and then no conclusion to the story line.
B009738XXM|5.0|I bought this CD because my daughter loves the song call me maybe.  She love singing along and has now discovered that there are a lot of songs on it she like.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Enjoyable quick read. Entertaining as you drift back to the days of  sailing the world looking for adventure. Great in-flight book
B000SEI230|4.0|Made you smile and cry at the same time. Shows you the true meaning of love, forgiveness, kindness and miracles
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Ok it is a eng I a cat in the hat to be or Mott two be I am done
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was amazing. I'm not a reader, and it took me only a couple hours to finish. I love the fact that it's not a typical story. There are multiple twists. Thank you for this read. I loved the smiles, laughs, and tears I got. Highly recommended!!!
B009CPES4I|2.0|We almost enjoyed the move.  However, the Amazon/TIVO delivery did not provide closed captioning.<br />After so many years of improvements in HD movie delivery, you would think Amazon could provide closed captioning for people who need that feature to really enjoy their movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son FIRST downloaded this game to my phone where I fell in love with it and now that I have my kindle fire I think it's even better. I can't wait to finish all the levels and then go onto flow bridges.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|i love this movie.  action from beginning to end. just as good as all the other movies in the series
B001AFF25W|5.0|I bought the kindle version and read through the whole thing in 3 hours with bookmarks to go back to tomorrow to make an action plan. Although it is not rocket science, there was a lot of wisdom and some really good perspective on things that I hadn't considered before, or knew deep down but had never heard in such a crystallized way. A good and easy read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great story, wonderful special effects, magnificent acting, great scenery . unbelievable twists and turns. I can't get enough always waiting for the next episode.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is so much fun to play with!! I like how I have so many optoins and that this is one of them!!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|May be a bit intense for young kids because of violence, but overall a good action/suspense story.  Wish I had read the book as well.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Good graphic novel adaptation lacking the frank miller narrative, but still a well done animated film. Can't wait for the next one.
B004FEJ3VY|5.0|My Son absolutely LOVED this new toy of his. It's a little bigger than we thought it would be, so it came out to be a great deal!
0439023491|3.0|I found out my granddaughter wanted this book and her teacher said it was a good book for young adults.  She was pleased with the gift.
0316069434|3.0|It was not as good as previous books. I will continue to purchase his work. Everyone has off days. I've read all  of Connelly's work so the bar is  set high for each new book.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|After seeing that people have been reporting problems with the Facebook app only showing the first 10 posts for a couple of months now, it is obvious that Amazon doesn't care about anything but sales. The Kindle Fire HD that I got for my wife for Christmas will be returned shortly since that was to be one of the primary uses for her.<br /><br />I'm not certain when or how the problem was fixed, but she said it is working perfectly now. All post are showing and everything is as it should be. Changed to 5 stars.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|So well written with engaging characters that  I did not have to consciously suspend belief. Once you get started you are not going to want to put this one down.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|All the usual provocative intrigue of good scifi and set in Bangkok too.  This is a futuristic version of the John Burdett detective novel atmosphere.  I want more like this.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Haven't had time to really know how to play yet.  Will be trying it more later when I have more time and no company.
B0018RC7QE|1.0|With DeNiro and Streep, I expected a much better movie. Very predictable plot. Difficult to feel empathy for the main characters
B005DOKL3E|5.0|It will come in handy when I have the opportunity to take the Kindle with me.  Still early yet and I'm still learning.

B009DJB9HC|5.0|I am leaving my original review below, but I wanted to revise my comments as I have been listening to this more and I like it more each time I listen to it. Sure, Joe Bonamassa doesn't sing much on this one. That is because Glenn Hughes wrote all of the songs this time and he writes for his own voice. I actually like the sound of his voice more now that I have listened to it a few more times as well. He writes to his own vocal strengths and sings in his range. 30+ years of profesional singing would make you sound a little rough too. All of the instruments are first rate and there is actually a lot more guitar work than is seems at first. I think the keyboards still got short changed again, but I guess that is their dynamic.<br /><br />It is really too bad they will not tour behind this CD, Joe Bonamassa seems to have other things he wants to do now.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I agree with a lot of the other reviewers that this effort is not as strong as the first two BCC CDs. The songs aren't as strong and the playing and production are not as tight and focused. It really does seem like a Glenn Hughes solo record. I think this is becuase he pretty much wrote all of the songs and the other three just came in a laid down their tracks. I don't hear Joe Bonamassa singing lead on a single track. Maybe he is doing like Pete Townshend started to do in the later years of the Who and keeping his best writing for his own projects. It is a shame because if Joe ever wanted to have a \\"hit\\" song on the radio or Billboard his best chance is probably with this band. Not that his own stuff isn't brilliant, just the nature of the business and the name recognition that a \\"Supergroup\\" can bring.<br /><br />The keys should have a more frontal role also. It doesn't always have to be a guitar solo. Bonham is perfect as always, but I also agree with some of the other reviewers about the \\"nails-on-chalkboard\\" vocals in some places. I think this is partly because of the mix. They wereprobably refined and toned down in the mix-down on the other records. All-in-all something of a disappointment considering the very high bar that was set on the first two albums.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book is well written and easy to read, and also fun. I'm always looking for books to get me out of my \\"shyness\\" and this did the trick to start a great conversation with anybody. Great book Peter W. Murphy! And I'll continue to read this book again and again from every last detail to become better and better speaker.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I chose this rating because is the one it deserves. I always loved Pac-Man. I used to play it with my brothers on our old computer all the time and it was just awesome, funny and this app for the kindle it looks almost the same as that one we have on the computer. It was a long time since I played it for the last time so once I found it on my kindle and played it, it was like go back in time and feel like a child again and enjoy it. Great application, it looks awesome and easy to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am getting minecraft on pc so I wanted to see what it was like so I got the game and I loved it there are updates coming like 0.6.0 there might be adding armor and cake and more updates I strongly recommend that you buy this game and on pc I guarantee you Will love it I did  bye bonus seed 0.5.0 mine were you spawn and you will find diamonds and gold subscribe to Toby games and Stan Lee world of heros tobuscas bye
B00633W614|5.0|I really really enjoy The Sins of the Father, can't wait for the next book to come out next may.
0316228532|2.0|I was so excited to read Rowling's newest book. What a huge disappointment! Pagford is a town I would never want to visit and there is not one character there I would want to get to know better. Such a shame! What the heck happened to one of my favorite writers?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had heard some negative reviews on this final book regarding the ending.  I honestly don't see what everyone was so upset about.  It is not your typical &#34;and they all live happily ever after&#34;  ending, but honestly, I prefer the more &#34;real life&#34; version of things anyway.  Great series, read all three in just a few days time.
1400067820|3.0|This is a bit of a difficult read. On the one hand, the concept is rather simple. There are those things that are fragile. Instability and disorder and randomness are bad for them. There are those things that are stable and resistant. Then there are those things that the author calls \\"antifragile\\" -- things that actually benefit from stress and disorder. Much of the world is fragile. Stable is better, but antifragile is best.<br /><br />Of course, there's more to it than that, and Taleb devotes his wide-ranging book to explaining the concept in various concepts, often tied into his own life.<br /><br />It was thought-provoking while I was reading it, and I do give Taleb credit for writing just what he wants to. He does appear to have a bit of a bias against editors, though, and I wonder if it's because he's been told that his writing could benefit from one. One generally writes for an audience, after all, and a GOOD editor will help the author toward that goal. Perhaps it's bad editors whom Taleb dislikes, and he's just never met a good one?<br /><br />The concept, though simple, might be difficult to grasp without a fair amount of explanation. But only certain people are willing to follow the author down the path he's laid. I really do think that a good edit could have made a much more readable, shorter book that might have reached more people. But then again, perhaps that was not Taleb's goal. Perhaps he just wanted his philosophy of life down on paper.<br /><br />Anyway, it's hard to review this book. I think it's worth reading if you come across it. I'm not sure I can give it an affirmative recommendation, but there are very few books I think of as a waste of time, and this is certainly not one of them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, loved the series...definately worth reading!  I think this was the best book in the series as far as character development and action!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I consider myself &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; aficionado having viewed probably ever motion picture version from the original black and white to this one.  This is hands down my absolute favorite but then again, look at the source.  Disney knows a thing or two about Christmas.  I really like the human animation style of this movie.  Jim Carey nails Scrooge and the three spirits.  It is visually spectacular and colorful.  This version captures the essence of Dickens' celebrated novella and can be watched time and time again with renewed freshness and classic scenes.  A must have if you're a fan of this timeless classic.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|The movie is great but the inside of the case that holds the DVD was broken. It may be a packing problem.
030788743X|5.0|This book was a great adventure, completely fun and a very fast read.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what I was expecting with the 80's aspect of the book, but it wasn't this.  It didn't resonate with me as much as I thought it would (even though I was a late-teen in the 80s).  That didn't impact my enjoyment of the book, I'm just mentioning it as much as been made of it.  I really don't think you needed to have watched the movies or heard the music to enjoy the book.  Though it would be fun to watch it all afterwards or even while reading the book, especially if you are reading on a tablet.<br /><br />More than anything it was about video games.  Some I knew, and some I didn't.  But I had my share of staying up all nice putting all my hard earned tips into a Pac Mac machine, or sitting in a room all day trying to get Luke to the princess, so I could definitely relate.<br /><br />This is a book to be read for the pure fun of it.  If you are hoping for something deep and meaningful, it's probably not here.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I have to say, I was starting to get bored with Angry Birds, but this one got me hooked again. new \\"physics\\" help make this game fun again!
B0081BU42O|3.0|I love Banks's sci-fi, and I really enjoyed the chance to revisit the Culture again in a fun story. I just felt that by the end, there were a bunch of big, loose ends flopping around that he never got around to tying up. It's that whole \\"Chekhov's gun\\" thing -- Banks trots out several big plot threads over the course of the novel, but most of them don't really come to fruition by the time everything's over.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT -----------------------------------------<br /><br />The biggest challenge, for me, was the Banstegeyn / Chekwri plotline. We spend a good deal of time with them, and they certainly play a role in the plot along the way, but B's underlying motives for assassinating the President, betraying the Ronte, etc. were never really clear (to me, at least). The most likely -- but still unconfirmed -- explanation was that he had spent so much of his life obsessed with seizing power that he couldn't bear to have everyone Sublime first, and so he put a grand plan into motion to stop the whole process, and give himself the chance at power he craved.<br /><br />I was willing to hold off on clearly understanding what made him tick, because I assumed that it would all be revealed by the end in some kind of storyline that brought him and Chekwri into more direct conflict with Vyr, etc. Instead, after his proxy Agansu (predictably) fails, Banstegeyn basically just shrugs and says \\"Meh...I guess I'll just Sublime.\\" That was one of the rare moments in a Banks book where I really just kind of lost my suspension of disbelief, and felt \\"That makes no sense for him to do at all.\\"<br /><br />Not to nitpick, but as long as I'm trying to substantiate my point, here are some of the other plot points that just seemed to hang out there for me:<br />- The android, and especially the whole thing about believing that he was still in a simulation. Aside from some random comments, his delusional state never really mattered in the plot. Even as a character, he just kind of follows Vyr and Berdle, and then ends up at the bottom of an elevator shaft, never to appear (or matter) again.<br />- The Caconym / Zoologist plotline. There's this whole set-up with the interior world created, and the Zoologist's potential connection to the Sublime, etc...and then at the end, the Caconym goes to look for the Z, the Z's gone, and the C just goes \\"Meh...oh, well.\\" and shuts it down.<br />- The whole plot line around Vyr's extra arms, and playing the Sonata, etc. It's a perfectly nice character detail, but the fact that she has the extra limbs, and finally plays the Sonata don't really matter in the plot.<br />- The Ronte-Liseiden conflict provides a couple of extra battle scenes, but again...they're all sidelined by the end of the book, with no real roles in the outcome.<br />- Finally, for a book that's got a bunch of Culture Minds front-and-center, there's very little of the detailed battle scenarios that you see in the other books, where the ships' intricate targeting systems, ability to slip into different timescales, etc. all play a big, gripping part in the excitement of space battles. Here, the one battle you totally want to see takes place off-stage -- the Mistake Not... basically says something along the lines of \\"Now you're gonna get it\\", and then the chapter ends.<br /><br />So, again, I totally enjoyed it, but it didn't really come together for me like some of Banks' better books do.ollows Vyr and Berdle, and then ends up at the bottom of an elevator shaft, never to appear (or matter) again.<br />- The Caconym / Zoologist plotline.

B000FC1192|3.0|I bought this book because the movie was so fun in a grim sort of way.the book is the same.it's a short read from a cchild's perspective.a good easy story to read for yourself or to your kids.
B0099TJ4YQ|3.0|I am a James Taylor fan from way back, but I have to admit that this album did not wow me.  I guess I am burned out by the standards of the season; most arrangements are not particularly original.  (Check out the Josh Groban/Brian McKnight version of &#34;Angels We Have Heard On High&#34;.  Just glorious!)  I was looking forward to &#34;In the Bleak Midwinter&#34;, probably my all time favorite non-standard Christmas song.  It was unremarkable; I prefer the Julie Andrews version.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I first found this book at a library and when I moved I was unable to find it again. My husband bought me a kindle and I decided to search for the title and was very excited when I found it on Amazon. I love this book and enjoy reading it over and over. I find Nikki Six to be very inspiring with all that he went through and to still come out on top. In two words: beautiful story.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|i just received the kindle fire 8.9 HD as a gift. i downloaded the FB app. the news feed does not load past the first few. after about 10 to 12 posts it will no longer load feed. i removed the app since it appears to be an ongoing problem that willnot be addressed as indicated by the numerous complaints.  if i coukd rate it zero stars i would.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This definitely built on the Matt Damon character, and presented a likeable character in the latest adventure.  Car chase and he got the girl, what else could you want?
0316066524|5.0|It's a long book, but it's worth the read.  This is a book I will remember forever, that made me wish I had never read it so I could pick it up fresh.  HAL INCANDENZA HAS LEFT A GIANT HOLE IN MY HEART.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has left me speechless, it has touched me in a way that I can't describe. I felt every emotion in this book. I cried, I laughed, I really did not want this book to end. I have been thinking of Sky and Holder since I started reading this book and I am sure I will continue thinking about them now that I finished. I will never forget this book, it was truly amazing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|easy to use and very addicting. just started playing and can't stop, easy to see and understand. nay replace my solitary game.
B000MGATTE|5.0|The first time I read it, I just gobbled it up, then went back and read it slowly to get more of the \\"little details.\\" And I have now read it a few more times. And every time, I really think I enjoy it more. This book has become a bad habit, I think. It's within shouting distance of my all-time favorite King book, Duma Key.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I get that it's a free game but having an ad pop-up literally after each game is quite ridiculous. It's way too frequent to make this app truly enjoyable. :-(
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I watch this movie with my kid and we loved it!!!<br />From beginning to end very entertaining and perfect for kids!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is easy enough for my physically handicapped daughter to use it.  She just loved it.  Her 4 year old nephew taught her how to play it.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I chose this rating not because of the movie (which I thought it was a 5 star) but because we might have had a better viewing experience if it were not due to playback issues (stuttering, buffering). I don't know if these issues come from the Internet connection and bandwidth, or an overloaded server on the vendor's end of the stream. Nevertheless, I will continue to download other movies since this was only the second time we used this service.
B0091LS07E|2.0|I was excited to buy this cd after hearing the song \\"Girl on Fire\\". However the original song is not even on this cd.  You will be surprised that the cd has the inferno version of \\"girl on fire\\" which is a remix with Nicki Minaj. I should have just bought the original song off of iTunes
B0084I9QIW|4.0|My husband hated the fact that Micheal kept<br />grabbing his crotch during the performance and<br />with that complaint being repeated through out the video<br />it's something I'll have to watch on my own.

B002ZG99CM|4.0|Ok, I'm going to have to admit it, I loved this movie.  I approached this with no small degree of trepidation, since the original had a special place in my memory from my younger days, and I had the horrible feeling that a remake would just be more of the same but without Pat Morita and with a predictable dose of sweetener in it.  But I was wrong - the story has been sufficiently given a new dimension by setting it in China, meaning the theme of the outsider being shunned is all the more relevant.  Also Kung Fu is somehow a more appropriate martial art than Karate.  The biggest and best surprise is in the casting - Jaden Smith is more than ever a mini-Will Smith with all the charisma that implies, but it is Jackie Chan that is quite a revelation, genuinely acting and emoting in a believable way, without his usual tongue in cheek approach.  The end result is a genuine and quite affecting story with believable characters, which nods to the original in a satisfying way, without ever treading the same ground too obviously - no `wax on, wax off' here, but a novel alternative instead.  It's a little grittier than the original, in a way that helps sell the danger in a more believable way, but leavens it with just enough heart to keep it in PG realm.<br />Yes it is not going to hold any big surprises for you, but if you're half human you're going to find it at least a little heart warming, and if it suffers a little from being somewhat of a Tourism Board approved advert for China at times, well it's beautiful enough scenery to forgive.  It's arguably better than the original in many ways, better written, better fight choreography and some better ideas - but I wonder if even with all that going for it, it struggles to match the teacher - pupil chemistry of the original .  Having said that, this is a real treat, far exceeded my expectations - recommended.
B003OWVHVC|3.0|There are really only 2 good songs on this CD.  The rest of the songs are great if you are trying to go to sleep.  Do not drive any distance with this CD.  You will fall asleep behind the wheel.

1401224792|2.0|I have to say at the start that I am a huge FABLES fan, from the first days of the series. The concept hasn't tired for me at all, and I think overall Willingham finds ways to keep the characters and stories fresh -- not an easy thing to do with a monthly on-going series in a field that hates endings and permanent character changes.  All of that being said, I felt like this was one of the weaker entries into the series.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the basic concept: Bigby Wolf finding out that there are indeed werewolves in the \\"mundy\\" world. There's nothing wrong with the basic problem: as a self-contained and fairly in-bred society with its roots in Nazi Germany, the werewolves are not exactly well-adjusted. And it's not that the story isn't self-contained: the call-backs to previous Fables storylines (including Bigby's World War II service and the early machinations and death of Bluebeard) tell new readers what they need to know without veering off into detailed flashbacks or \\"you really should read volume xxx\\" footnotes.  Despite all of this, for me the story came off feeling at once too big and too empty. Aside from the always-strong characterization of Bigby (who, let's face it, has been the heart of the Fables story since the beginning, even as Snow White is the soul), the rest of the main characters feel largely interchangeable and stereotypical: the old friend with a secret, the young girl with premonitions, the angry cop, the femme fatale, etc.  I found myself not really caring what happened to anyone except Bigby, and I'm pretty sure that wasn't Willingham's intent (considering the strong effort he's always made in Fables to make even tertiary characters stand as individuals).<br /><br />The cover art is gorgeous. The interior page art is easy to follow, reasonably realistic and but not all that detailed. The story gets the job done and of course leaves room for further complications to arise. I wish I'd enjoyed the book more than I did.<br /><br />Also: kudos to Willingham for sliding a sly reference to \\"Once Upon A Time\\" into the narrative.r />Also: kudos to Willingham for sliding a sly reference to \\"Once Upon A Time\\" into the narrative.

If you are looking for a book that will at times leave you breathless I highly recommend this book.  I connected so much with the characters, I couldn't put it down until I learned how it would all end. Fantastic book!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Just like everyone else is saying, the app only shows the last 10 updates or so.... not very helpful at all.  Also, it doesn't show the entire update of the posts it does show.  For instance, it'll say 'So and So' posted a new picture and won't show the picture unless it's the top few posts.  I might as well go on the web and look at Facebook that way.

Best songs are: Caffeine, Midlife Crisis, Small Victory, Kindergarten, Crack Hitler, Be Aggresive, and Land Of Sunshine. Much 'heavier' record than its predescessor, 1989's The Real Thing.

6304711905|5.0|I bought both &#34;Tombstone&#34; and &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34;, they both have something to add to to this epic story base on real people and historic events of American history in the time of the old west. This kind of movie gives me insight and great respect for those who were brave enough to face the adversities and misfortune of an untamed frontier riddled with lawlessness. Through all that life could deal out Wyatt Earp managed to find himself with respect and honor and being truly blessed in the end, wins the hearts of many. I highly respect and would have been honored to know the man.  This story was long over due to be made with modern film techniques that really bring the story to life while still making one wonder.... What Really Happened?

B004YM6JK0|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows on television.  Period.  Writing, acting, editing.  All top cabin.  Special effects are also very good.  The local's used in the show are perfect.  Season seven is again excellent.  I remember the first season , watching occasionally while my wife watched this show.  I remember telling her that it was a typical CW pretty boy show.  But it started to draw me in.  And I am very glad it did.  Seven seasons later I'm a invested fan of the show.  Try out watching it..you will not be disappointed!

1615470158|5.0|I have been following Rob's blog for some time now and was always impressed by how well he can explain complex ideas. One thing that I always struggled with was developing a step-by-step understanding on PowerPivot, rather than learning bits and pieces through other books and blogs, and then trying to integrate the concepts. This books solved that problem for me.<br /><br />I have read some of the other books on PowerPivot sold on Amazon, and this is THE book if you are just getting started, or want to make sure you understand the \\"why's\\" behind how stuff works. It is very well-written and up to the point.<br /><br />I will be ordering more copies and recommending it to others in my Fortune 500 CPG company as we continue making a transition from Reporting to true BI.

B0092QITO2|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that I have never seen the original and I am not a fan of sci fi/futuristic movies, but after seeing the trailer for this I just had to see it, and I am so glad I did. This movie is packed to the brim with action and wonderful CGI. I was completely blown away and mesmerized by this movie and to be truthful I really don't understand ask the bad reviews. Maybe a majority of the negative reviews are from fanboys of the original and have the mentality of how dare you remake this movie, and them are the type of people who are going to hate this movie no matter what, which is really sad. So if you are a fanboy of the original and you have the mindset that this movie sucks right from the get go, without even giving it a chance then do yourself a favor and don't watch it, but if you are someone that love tons of action, a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you thinking, then this is the perfect movie for you. If you give this movie a fair shot I promise you will have a blast and be blown away, I certainly was!

B009IEXKXI|3.0|Note:  This review includes some spoilers.<br /><br />An astronaut stranded on Mars.  Will soon die on this inhospitable planet.  Unless his innate ingenuity expands to superhuman levels. This is an interesting premise.  The writing was quite good.  But....after the protagonist, an engineer / botanist, had fixed the umpteenth thousandth item, with each and every repair described in excruciating detail, my attention began to wander.  A lot.  And what began as a possibility, that an intelligent individual, with some appropriate equipment and great training might survive for a while in an absolutely inhospitable place, went beyond that realm of believability way before he began --- ANNND completed --- something like a 2,000 mile trip in some sort of Mars Rover.  Through a GIANT continent-wide sandstorm!!<br /><br />I plowed my way through the end of this book anyways.  I think I wish I had not.
B008NW67IQ|4.0|I really like these guys.  They have a rock and roll sound with a keltic edge to it.  Great album.
B009X01C64|5.0|Love this - natural leather, solid construction, multiple standing angles, swivel mode that supports charging while viewing.  Although it adds a little weight, it makes for a very attractive and functional case.  The only things missing are a 'keyboard' angled fold (it stands up for viewing, but not for typing), and a clasp to keep the interior leaf from falling open when the case is picked up by one end.  Don't let those stop you though - I just prop the case up on anything handy for a keyboard mode.  I would definitely purchase this again.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|If you like scary Movies as I do you MAY like this Movie. It was recommended by a friend...however this is a very violent disturbing Movie. Also hard to understand the plot so had to watch it a couple of times to understand the entire story...without a &#34;Spoiler Alert&#34; and giving away too much I will say once you watch this it sticks with you from the brutality towards young women. It is not an American Movie but is dubbed so well you can't really tell. It has been compared along the line of &#34;Hostel&#34; BUT even tho it is very brutal there IS a plot and message Hostel didn't have. Not scary but VERY freaky, so you have been warned it IS brutal.
B002VWNID6|4.0|good condition and cost

1469273772|4.0|Was a great read, good storyline, well planned plot and climax, however the end made me berlieve this just may be the last we see of Jack Ryan's America.  I may have a faulty memory, but I just don't remember any of the previous novels tying up all the loose ends.  Nothing is left hanging.  Fade to balck in the The president's study as they discuss weighty issues like women and politics.  Not sure but that feels like the end.

0316228532|5.0|When I heard that J.K. Rowling's first adult book would be the story of an election in a small town, I was, like many readers, puzzled. As someone who read each of the Harry Potter books with great expectations, I suppose I always expected her first book away from the wizarding world to at least be similar. I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is (as you could gather from reading the dust jacket) the story of a small town attempting to fill the shoes of a local politician who has died, leaving a \\"casual vacancy\\" on the town council. However, while this basic plot line is carried through every page of the book, the novel becomes so much more than that. We are given our view of the small town of Pagford through the eyes and ears of at least 25 different characters, all of whom play an integral part in the events of the story. Children and parents, wives and husbands, boyfriends and girlfriends, grandfathers and grandmothers... the town of Pagford is developed in our mind through nearly every viewpoint. And while we are given very view physical details concerning the town's layout or appearance, beyond a few settings that return many times throughout the story, those details are not missed, because the beauty and life of Pagford is in its residents, and their interactions with one another. J.K. Rowling has developed each of these characters, until each of them is unique, memorable, and relatable. You will cheer for the small triumphs of your favorite characters and quake with anger over the actions of others. Even with so many characters, there was never a moment where I felt as though I did not know who someone was, because each character was so unique.<br /><br />That being said, this novel is by no means for everyone. On the surface it deals with over 30 characters, all of whom are interacting with each other throughout the story and who are related to each other, either through familial ties or others, in at least one way (usually more).While I personally had no trouble keeping track of the intricate web of Pagford's social life, I could see almost anyone else having difficulty keeping track of characters. Beyond the mere scope of the novel, it also deals with many difficult, painful, adult topics, including drug addiction, sex, domestic violence, incest, adultery, politics, racism, sexism, religion, and many others. If you are someone who has difficulty reading about these topics, especially when they are spoken about as openly as Rowling does here, this book may not be for you. If you are someone younger than 18, this book may not be for you. If you prefer stories that leave you glowing inside, this book may not be for you.<br /><br />This novel will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you laugh. You will cheer for small victories, and curse under your breathe at defeats. You will be shocked. You will experience deep, emotional pain. You will feel every emotion of these characters, and experience their struggles along with them. You will find yourself tied to this small town, thinking about it at work or in your car or while waiting to go to sleep. And when the story is over, and the last page is turned, you will want to open the front cover and walk down the streets of Pagford all over again. That is the test of a true literary experience. That is why I gave this novel five stars. And that is why, in the long term, I believe this novel will and rightfully should have a bigger impact on literature than Harry Potter.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a really good book and I like the story and it has interesting plot the one thing is its kind of weirdly written like sometimes when listing things she doesn't have an \\"and\\" or it seems like she's trying to do some good writing but it ends up confusing or not in proper grammar. Overall it's a very very good book!<br /><br />I recommend this book to people who like action, suspense,touching moments. ( See isn't that annoying? ) This book has gotten a bad rep as gory and scary bit really would be fine for 9+.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Great Movie - very good and funny as well.  Would Recommend to anybody.  The best MI yet.  Cant wait for the next one.

B0011UBDTK|5.0|Always good for me to watch something from start to finish. So since I could not catch it on TV often, I bought the series. Its about 4 girls trying to find love in the big apple and the horrible dates it took them to get to find price charming.
0061689246|5.0|Reading this novel a second time after more than 15 years does make for an enriching experience. I am made even more aware of Gaiman’s mastery of Nordic mythology and marvel at the way he has melded both the stories of folkloric gods and the lost luster of contemporary America. Bearing in mind the spate of superhero movies that sees these Nordic gods battling it out and wreaking havoc in America mostly came after Gaiman’s book reminds the reader how much of a forerunner the author is.<br /><br />Almost every character in this expansive work has a backstory and surprising connection to a mythical god and they form part of this alternative universe that main protagonist Shadow lands himself in after being let out of prison just a few days ahead of finishing his sentence for a grisly reason. He lands a job as a grifter and master conman Wednesday, who leads him on a psychedelic cross country quest that is as wild as Dorothy’s journey to the Emerald City laced with acid.<br /><br />The consequences of lost faith on the fortunes of gods who lose their significance are darkly humorous and allegorical in a way that only Gaiman knows how. Shadow finds out the true god identity of a former cell mate who explains his fallen mortal state: “You got to understand the god thing. It's not magic. Not exactly…. You take all the belief, all the prayers and they become a kind of certainty, something that lets you become bigger, cooler, more than human…. And then one day they forget about you, and they don't sacrifice, and they don't care, and the next thing you know you're running a three card monte game on the corner of Broadway and 43rd”.<br /><br />Richly entertaining and mystical - definitely worth the revisit.
0545123275|4.0|I bought this book basically because everyone is raving about Maggie Stiefvater and her writing style and because I felt left out. Also, this was some kind of a challenge. I hate werewolves and I was interested if Stiefvater could actually make me love them. She couldn't.<br /><br />The best thing about Shiver was the writing style. Oh man, it was amazing. So lyrical, so fluent so fairy-tale-ish. Somehow soft and sweet and wonderful! I don't know how Stiefvater does it but she makes the story of a normal girl preparing breakfast in a kitchen sound like a centuries-old myth.<br /><br />The writing is the base for everything else I loved about Shiver. The characters were described in just enough detail, just enough emotion to identify with them and to understand how they feel. The proof for that is that I actually understood how Grace felt. The thing is that I don't like any kind of animal very much. I mean, I treat them well and stuff. I am a vegetarian, by the way, as I think that every being on this planet has the right to live, but I don't like touching them, I don't find them cute and stuff (maybe a really cute puppy would make an exception...), so I don't understand how one could fall in love with a wolf. Even if he's part human. I still don't. But Stiefvater made me understand Grace - and like her, too. She was such a nice girl , dealing with some issues but throughout the whole story she's never whiny. She also goes through some typical teenager problems that I could relate to very well. The other characters were very well developed, as well. Alex was amazing, a great love interest but also a good friend. The story turned even better in my opinion when Isabel started to play a bigger role in it. She was the funny part somehow, although we do get to see some more serious sides of her, too. All the characters impressed with their depth and variety, no stereotyping at all!<br /><br />The plot itself as I said was rather slow, but enjoyable. Grace and Sam's relationship developed slowly and in a very sweet way. Credit to the realistic way everything fell into place - never forced, never cheesy.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how much I loved this book, but I'm just going to stop now by telling you to read this book, but read it slowly, carefully. Read it like you eat your favorite dessert!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I enjoyed every song on this album and was singing along ! This is one of my favorite Christmas albums of all time.
0316228532|4.0|I thought I'd make a big spectacle over the new Rowling book. I mean, I started reading it the day it came, even thought of pulling an all - nighter to make it more special or at least post this review with a bunch of special features. The reason I decided to treat this book like any other book was because it felt like any other book to me as I read it. A good novel for adults, I'm glad I read it and here's why:<br /><br />Rowling's writing style was, is and will always be fantastic. I just like discovering the hidden humor behind the words and between the lines. I like that she makes me laugh out loud or grin sullenly. The Casual Vacancy is a chunk of a book, but I never felt like taking a break or reading something different. I was never fed up with the story because Rowling lulled me into that world so fast - and then I started confusing it with my own. It all just felt so real and alive and I seemed to know the characters like I know my oldest friends. Sound familiar? Hehe...<br /><br />The actual plot and idea of the book surprised me but I think they were very well done, too. Rowling told like....ten (or probably more) different stories that all intertwined in a way and she still found the right words for every one of them. The issues in TCV were quite heavy...and the ending was quite disturbing, but then again it's pretty close to the real world (I would say).<br /><br />The only factor that makes me give this book two and not three Smarties is that after all there are books I enjoyed more. There's a reason I don't read adult books unless I'm forced to and there's also a reason for people calling The Casual Vacancy an adult book. Let's just say although the author did everything right it was just not my cup of tea.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Finally Stephen King goes back to what he is good at...making you believe the unbelievable in an ordinary way. The book is about wishing to change the past and its unexpected consequences.
B00886XQO0|4.0|Need to give more information on how to hook it up not all systems are the same. Some of the Xbox 360 are older. Do not hook up the same.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|With the Kindle version on my iPad Mini, reading this book is an interactive experience. With the embedded videos and links, the concepts literally jump off the page. I've often debated whether I wanted to learn how to cook because I didn't know where to start. With the 4-Hour Chef, I feel like I'm embarking on an adventure instead.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Perfect game to entertain my daughter when I am busy or driving in the car. Just wish it read out loud to her
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game recommend this game for everyone. Not violent just all fun. If you love building and adding things to the game this game is for you
0061928356|5.0|This story of an adopted daughter shows what the birth mother's life was like and why she made the decisions that she made.  This is an accurate description of what life would be like for a family coming from a village to a big city.  I cried and hurt for all those involved.  I bought this book for my own children to keep and to share with their children in the years to come.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|A long-time fan of Ken Follett, I didn't care for this book at all.  So politicized--conservatives and Catholics were always ignorant or evil, while social democrats were always wise and likable.  Too crass--so many first kisses were accompanied by unwanted descriptions of nether regions.  And very, very tiresome--pedantic descriptions of the events and various factions wore on and on.  Skip this one and hope for better in the sequel.  It's too late for me: I'm through with this series, and probably with this author.
B00A757EFW|3.0|When looking for games that were more of my speed this popped up. I have not spend alot of time with it but so far it okay.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The author seemed to tell his story straightforward and matter of fact.  I wanted to know WHAT happened during that raid to capture Osama Bin Ladin who has caused hell on Earth for Americans.  I do not feel the book was biased at all. This is a good book to read if your interested in the truth about some of our bravest men in the world who keep our country safe from terrorists.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This DVD arrived really promptly, and I was able  to add it to the other Brave items requested by my grand daughter. Of course, I watched it also as I ordered two copies and thought it was very entertaining.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Entertaining and moves fairly quickly. Have not gotten past the free part yet, but so far, enjoyable. Like the history and mythology tie-in.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was powerful. loved every last page of it! Made my lazy day perfect. Thank you. Must find more just like it..
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Fairly predictable but funny.  Not appropriate for kids. The family of adult children watched this together and all enjoyed it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love this game and enjoy playing it.  It's very addicting and mindless.  I play this game all of the time.
0316019984|5.0|This is better than I expected.  My 3 1/2 year old nephew LOVES it, it's his first 'big boy' comic book.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is pretty cool.  It's a mindless, fun game to play to relax.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I received this CD for Christmas because I love Bruno Mars and I love the CD. I like the different styles of the songs on the CD.<br /><br />The downfalls:<br />My 12 year old LOVES Bruno Mars but due to the sexual content of some of the songs, I can't let her put it on her I-Pod<br />Personal Preference - Wish I had the deluxe edition so there would be more than 10 songs
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love, love, love this game.  There's not much more I can say other than than I play this game all of the time.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I have to write a review so he you go this isn't that bad it is a good 7th book
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love cabin Fever love it. I was just hooked to from beginning to end I love it. LOL HAHA
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Being a huge \\"Family Guy\\" fan I really had high hopes for this movie, unfortunately it wasn't that great. The plot was lame and totally predictable, and the funny parts were few and very far between making the movie seem longer than it is, I.e. hurry-up-and-end so I can get on with my life sort of feeling.  Not a total waste, but I wouldn't buy it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I rated this book a 5, because its a page turner, and it makes you want to read more and more. And its a romantic book
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|I like this album it has all the feel of bay area thrash and metal sound of the early 90’s with an evolved feel. I do miss chuck Billy’s use of range, but the sound is very reminiscent of the testament I grew up with in the 90’s, with a relevant modern twist. This is where metal would have gone if grunge never destroyed it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is a great graphic novel for a young reader. It may have a couple misspelled words buts it is a child's book
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My four year old grandson taught me to play Angry Birds.  We both enjoy the game.  Although, I think he is better than me at playing the game.
B008476HBM|5.0|The book speaks for itself. One of the greatest works ever created. It is no wonder that Jane Austen and her novels are still revered today.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Downloaded just fine but froze up my Kindle on the third time I tried to play it. There was no option, as far as I could see, to resume play after a game. If there are instructions,  I failed to see them.<br />The gameplay was okay but then at my age,  I was not impressed. My 14 year old,  however,  loved it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was funny, and Jeff Kinney has made another great sequel in this series. Greg doesn't fail to entertain the reader once again and I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't finished the series so far.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|This dvd is freezing up at the end of the movie. Every time I watch it, the movie stops at the same spot or it freezes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Quick read, highly entertaining. Leaves many questions and leads right into a sequel. Will definitely continue the series. Well written.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just a good, easy &quot;time waster/relaxation&quot; game.  Easy to play.  Easy to enjoy.  Self explanatory.  Don't even NEED to read the instructions.
B00000F14B|5.0|I loved it. I remember watching it years ago on TV. This was my first time seeing it in color. All of the actors were good, even the supporting roles. I especially liked Shirley Jones in the scenes where she sings. Robert Preston does a good job of making you believe that he's the consummate con man, right up until he, \\"Got my foot caught in the door.\\" as he says. Just plain good family entertainment, You'll laugh and want to sing along.[[ASIN:B00000F14B The Music Man (Special Edition)]]
1449320104|5.0|This book is amazing! It's simplicity is breath-taking, because in simple way it shows you theory and samples of basic and also advanced things in C#.<br />My top recommendation for novice and expert programmers!
B000W93CHC|4.0|Not as good as the first but still entertaining.  Good historical details and an engaging story line. I little hokey at the end.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great story and great animation. This is a feel good movie that anyone can enjoy. A great moral story for all.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is our favorite Christmas movie. I'm so glad that they offer a blu-ray version with both the B&W as well as the colorized one. The extra featurette is also a lot of fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, never have been, bit I can read this book and the entire series multiple times. It's exciting, romantic, heartbreaking, and down right genius!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Can I rate this zero stars? The fact that you have to pay to unlock the hidden camera is ridiculous especially since its implied that the new Kindle  HD comes with a camera.  The pictures are extremely poor quality and you can only take pictures of yourself. Don't waste your money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've read over the last year. I was drawn in with all the humour and captivated with all the sadness. When a book can make laugh out loud and then make me feel sad, angry, hopeful, and relief it is a book to cherish.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more of Colleen's books. I can only hope her other books bring out the emotions that \\"Hopeless\\" has so that I can get swept away again.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I don't understand why anyone thinks this movie is worth 5 stars, when it isn't even worth 2.<br /><br />The movie is about 95% jerky camera pans on faux-desperate faces, caked with makeup.  Completely typical of contemporary American trash movies.  There is no great moral story to be found here.  Oh wait, a story of hope?  That's not worth the excruciating take after take of \\"Lost\\" style footage.
0345525558|5.0|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" by Vanessa Diffenbaugh<br />I loved this book from the beginning and didn't want it to end. I have always had a fascination with knowing the names history of flowers and plants and love finding them in natural surroundings. This book, The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh, (whose name is similar to the dieffenbachia plant) had such a moving story line in telling the story of Victoria, from her abandonment at birth, through childhood abuse, to her orphanage experiences and her difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. Victoria's life is portrayed with a depth of a feeling that pulls the reader into caring about this strange and sometimes difficult young woman. The story moves back and forth in time and place within the span of her life which brings greater meaning to why she behaves the way she does with people she meets.<br /><br />Victoria reminds me of several young people I have met and worked with over the years. They may be prickly but also may produce the most beautiful lives, just as some thorny plants produce soft and beautiful flowers. It is a story that can lift you up with expectation and hope, and than then bring you down and make you sad. It is a roller coaster ride of resiliency and success combined with sadness and disappointment.<br /><br />The idea of pouring over dusty and seldom read book after book in the personal pursuit of creating your own book of flowers and their meanings struck a cord with me. What a quiet and resolved drive and passion Victoria kept mentally reconnecting to her childhood to find understanding and meaning in her own life. There was a personal relationship with the flowers Victoria worked with and it was evident with all those who became involved in her world.<br />\\"The flower you're looking for is clearly the common thistle, which symbolizes misanthropy. Misanthropy means hatred or mistrust of humankind.\\"<br />\\"Does humankind mean everybody?\\"<br />\\"Yes,\\"<br />\\"I thought about this. Misanthropy. No one had ever described my feelings in single word.\\"<br /><br />I received this as an early reviewer copy and appreciate the opportunity to have read this book. It is hard to believe that this was a debut novel and Vanessa's own experiences as a foster mother and teacher shine through in this novel. For me this was an outstanding selection and I will be recommending this book as a book club read. I rate it as a full 5 star book.this. Misanthropy.

B007DIQC90|5.0|I bought this album largely \\"song unheard\\", based on, I think, a recommendation from a purchase of Mumford and Sons Sigh No More by the Amazon system. I played the snippets of the album and then decided to purchase it and also the Lumineers album. I am absolutely delighted with both albums. This is the kind of music I hear and then go check for what other albums I can buy by the same artist -- sadly, this is their debut, but I look forward to the future.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The story brought home to me the image of how horrible this war was and how so often people don't help when they should but stand by out of fear or some misguided judgement.  I'm sure there are many true stories that could be added to this one if we only knew the full extent of the horror of extermination of a people because of race or religion.  It is also heartwarming to know that many people will step forward and help their fellow-man when the opportunity arises.  I would read another book written by the above author.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I didn't see this at the theatre, but I heard some good reviews so I purchased it at a good sale price.  The story is interesting but the real reason to watch this movie is to see these guys have fun and show off their assets. Take it for what it is, and get it for a great price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game for kids. I would recommend for any body looking at games. My child loved it and i would recommend
B00APUYWYA|4.0|good movie.  We like the music, the cast were good also.  A family type of movie, entertaining for every one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great pics and easy to use<br />I like that I can change size of puzzles and add more scenes.<br />very pretty photos. it is a fast bit of fun and helps make a waiting too on tolerable.<br />I have just learned to use the kindle touch screens and this was a good game to learn with.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|This is a coming of age kind of movie.  It's not what I expected, but it was entertaining enough to watch all the way through.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My girls all love this movie. It is a cute idea and shows how Santa continues through generations. They like the idea of Santa being able to use computer and a spaceship. Very cute movie.
B0055SWM08|4.0|dont love the review reminders, but the game itself is highly enjoyable, and i like the peaceful spa music. interested to do more levels
B008469DGY|3.0|This would be nice if it were expanded to a full golf  hole and included putting.  There is really not much to it.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|As an engineer and reader of publications like \\"Scientific American\\" for decades, I was already roughly familiar with the subject matter.  But this book really pulled it all together for me.<br /><br />Even you are a non-scientist, you will find this book ineresting and very understandable.  You will come away with a broad understanding of the history of particle physics and a comprehensive view of the the Standard Model.  As an engineer, I also found the technology of the equipment fasciniating too.<br /><br />Through the careful use of non-technical language the author does not bog the layman down with complex mathematics and theory. However, he pays just enough attention to the details to convey a very comprehensive account of what is very complex science, weaves a very interesting story.<br /><br />One thing I would recommend to any reader who is not familiar with the concepts: Do NOT to wait until the end to read the appendices on \\"Spin\\" and the \\"Standard Model.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book to anybody who is curious about the tiny universe hidden just beneath the surface of everything around us.  It is weirder and more facinating that one might suspect!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I believe that Downton Abbey is the best movie ever made.  I have watch 1 & 2 about 6 times now.  I have purchased the Version 3 and waiting for the delivery January 29, 2013.  If it is as good as 1 & 2 it will be a winner.
B009MO5G90|5.0|This is a great movie!  When Walmart had it on display they did not have it in 3D and told me that it did not come in 3D.  I went home and went online with Amazon and of course Amazon had it.  Shipping was very quick and came packaged well.  I later went back to Walmart a few days later and low and behold they had the 3D version on display.  I would not only recommend this movie, but also recommend shopping with Amazon for all your shopping needs.  I do!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|wow, this was a great book, i'm not one for spoilers or long reviews, so i'll make this fast.  This book is a mixture of two of my favorite book genres, fantasy and romance.  Also, it's reasonably appropriate, at least it's not as bad as \\"Twilight\\"  Great series, plus, after you read at least the first two books, look at the lyrics for the song, \\"Some Nights\\" by FUN, see a connection, anyone?
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My Kindle Fire only shows 10 or so posts on the news feed them turn to blue not showing anymore. Needs updated badly!
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is the sweetest story and movie.  Wonderful for any age.  I bought 3 to share with others - from 2 yrs to 60 yrs. old.  Intend to order more!
B008S4FZHI|3.0|I was very disappointed with this book. I felt that the author had run out of ideas and had to rehash a lot of material from previous books to bulk out this one. I also felt that the plot really did not go anywhere and ceased abruptly. Very disappointing.
B001706I5I|5.0|We wanted to watch this on Christmas and were able to rent it from Amazon easily and with DVD quality.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So much fun! Don't want to put it down. Graphics are great!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend to family and friend.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult hits it out of the park again. I love all her books but sometimes I'm dissatisfied with the ending but this one ended okay.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A total twister! A must read. If you are considering to read this as a man it might just be the scariest thing ever!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World of do is a fun game. You should buy it if you like to do logic puzzles. Also available as a we download.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Not at all what I expected! In fact much more. Great Read! Includes Withes, Vampires and many other creatures. Can't wait to finish them all!
B009SIE6AA|5.0|This is a really lovely collection of classics and original pieces.  JT's voice is smooth and salty in just the right proportions.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Good movie. Well done. Liked it. Why can't I just give it 5 stars without having to comment like this?
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Our four year old granddaughter has claimed it as her very own! Let's see... I believe she has watched this particular movie over and over and over again at least 20 times since we purchased it! Grampa and Gramma have truly enjoyed it, as well. It definitely leaves you rolling on the floor with laughter!
0316227706|5.0|I received this as a gift. I love animals and photography, and this book is so fun. You can look at it a hundred times and pick up on something different in the dogs or excellence in the photography every time. Love it!!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|We watch this film over and over!  Antonio Banderas does such a super job of portraying this sly cat! Thoroughly enjoyable!
0316010669|5.0|This book arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised.  Doing business here was very easy and I experienced no problems.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is GREAT in any movie he's in!  really enjoyed him in this one, too!  The story was very good and, of course the acting was spot on! Another super Mark Wahlberg action-packed flick!
0399157565|5.0|I have written this review a couple times and am not sure why it won't take. I am pleased with this purchase for the price, speed of delivery and condition.  The experience that I had with this seller was very good. I purchased 4 Patricia Cornwell books at the same time due to the price. I am very pleased with the condition; timeliness of shipment and cost of hard cover books from this seller!
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading the book and seeing the movie at the theater, we had to own our own copy to watch whenever we wanted!!  So, we watched it again as soon as the DVD arrived at our home from Amazon!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|OMG!  I can't tear myself away from playing this game. Try as I might, I have a hard time helping those little birds take out the pigs! I can't seem to play just one game. If i don't score and score big, I redo the game over and over till I do. Then i keep going to the next level and so on till my eyes are red and weary. It's soooo addictive!
078689136X|4.0|I bought this book for my husband who loves the Castle series.  I was told that this is a good book.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|My husband and I are big fans of all of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian Chronicles books. So when &#34;John Carter&#34; came out in Movie form, we couldn't wait to go to the theater to see it. It was made so convincing well, we decided to purchased a copy so we could watch it anytime.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|This was my least favorite of the trilogy and I won't go in depth as to why (there are many similar reviews); in a nutshell I thought it was too long, somewhat muddled with no clear plot progression or climaxes, and required a strong ability to suspend disbelief to make it even remotely enjoyable. \\"Boring\\" would not be too harsh a word in my opinion.<br /><br />But the REAL travesty is the incredibly poor job of mixing the sound, in my case DTS-HD 5.1 found on the blu ray.  As a self-proclaimed home theater junky I expected a crisp, immersive surround sound experience from such a major title (even though it was disappointingly in 5.1 and not 7.1) and instead I found a surround mix devoid of any life or character... for most of the movie I could have just had my front stereo speakers on and not noticed much of a difference!  Center channel signals were weak and haphazardly edited, rear surround signals unbalanced, seeming non-existent for much of the movie and then suddenly punctuated with a gunshot or two that actually sounded good... for a second.<br /><br />And the LFE (Low Frequency Effects)?  I must actually issue a WARNING!!!  These are not only terrible but may also damage your home theater equipment!  Did they let a drunken intern decide the LFE mixing?!?!  I think these were ripped straight from the cinematic release and unless your \\"home theater\\" resides in a 5,000 sq.ft room with over $50,000 worth of commercial grade sound reproduction equipment you are unlikely to find this overemphasized bass very usable or enjoyable.  Those watching on a TV alone will never notice it, but if your home theater speaker system is too large to fit in the trunk of your car (Home Theater in a Box) I HIGHLY recommend that you keep the volume levels down, especially on a powered subwoofer, until you discover for yourself how it will react to this sound track!  I personally found nearly a +8 decibel bass boost to my *front speakers*, sound that should be going to the subwoofer(which was also over boosted), and I found it at even some of the strangest times like when a car is driving down the street...  What?!?!  At \\"theater reference\\"  SPL, you can (and might!) damage your speakers at high volume levels, particularly the subwoofer.  NO, this is not \\"awesome!\\"  This is shoddy work.  Listen to the LFE found in the beach scene in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", the pod racer scene from Star Wars Episode 1 \\"The Phantom Menace\\", or ANY of the depth charge scenes from the home theater reference movie \\"U-571\\"...  THAT is what surround sound should sound like.
1419705849|5.0|He loved, loved ,loved it! Has the whole series and as a new middle schooler, he can relate! He was clued to the book most of Christmas Day!
B001B7CNY2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies for several reasons and I've been procrastinating writing a review long enough!  This is a great war movie and war is hell.  This movie doesn't let you forget it for a second.  Set in WWII and loosely based on some actual events this movie documents the top secret mission given to a Navy submarine captain to capture the infamous \\"Enigma device\\", a technologically advanced (for the time) encryption device used by the Germans to help them achieve naval superiority during that phase of the war... this is historically accurate too, by the way.  The movie rarely has a quiet moment, where it just glides along the plot line.  Rather it's pretty much edge-of-your seat from one scene to the next, as of course the mission doesn't go nearly as smoothly as planned.<br /><br />Excellent acting by all parties involved with a few big names there too including  Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel.  Even the German sailors, the \\"bad guys\\", are characters that develop enough depth that the viewer can sympathize with them right from the start.  Cinematography and special effects are also top notch, even for a movie that first hit theaters in 2000.  Some of the underwater scenes especially bring the tension and physics of underwater warfare to the viewer in a convincing way that very few other war movies ever have.<br /><br />And as a special treat the surround sound encoding in this movie is AAA+, 10 out of 10 score, and one of a small handful of movies I grab from my collection when I am testing or dialing in a new surround system or just to show a home theater initiate exactly what a good movie should sound like.  The \\"depth charged\\" scenes in particular, at theater like volume levels, will put you right inside that WWII era submarine and have you looking around the living room for water leaks and broken bolts!  Be advised, it takes a pretty good home theater system, particularly at least one larger powered subwoofer, to make the mostout of these surround effects, but on the right system it's easy to see (or rather hear) why this movie was nominated for two awards at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.  It WON Best Sound Editing and should have won Best Sound Mixing too, in my opinion!<br /><br />So, whether you are a fan of war movies or simply need another good reference movie to show off your home theater system (or take it with you to the stores shopping for one and have some real fun!) this movie is a MUST HAVE.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We enjoyed it at the theater so much so that we decided to purchase it so we could watch it again as a family anytime at home! the movie has a wonderful message for kids and adults to take care of our planet! We enjoyed the characters in the movie and the actors that portrayed them.
0399157565|5.0|This is the latest Moreno and Scarpetta adventure. It's better than the next to latest book in my opinion, but there were a few sections that seemed forced. What i mean is, that there was a lack of flow, kind of unbelieveable, sort of like too much smoke and mirrors. Good ending though.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie for the tween and above. There are a lot of connotations, but they are done so well that you might not pick up on them the first, second or even third time of watching a scene.<br /><br />This is a popcorn must movie. And don't be texting or on your iPad while watching, you need all of your attention ere - lots of visual humor as well as auditory.
0316069434|5.0|For those of us who follow Harry Bosch we sit around waiting for these new installments of Boschs' adventures. This one does not disappoint, an unusual story with a good but perhaps predictable ending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was suspenseful, thrilling, and romantic with an ending that will give you chills. Loved it! It's a quick read.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|This is an awesome album. I have always loved Rod Stewart, but his newer mellow sound, less raspy, and these old timer songs are just great. Good for background music at home or work! Lovely.
B001RNO7B2|4.0|Great shoes!! Comfortable true fit. A nice design. Worth the money!  Adjust to your feet well and will get you through a rain storm dry (waterproof).  Well satisfied with its endurance!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Even though we've all heard these xmas songs hundreds of renditions and ways, i still really liked this album and plan to give a copy to my sister. Rod Stewart's voice is smooth and clear. The last song Auld Lang Syne is really awesome!
B0009PTXTK|5.0|Schleich horses are very well made and made for playing with.  My 4 year old grandson is a real &#34;horse nut&#34; and he loved this guy.  I've bought him Schleich horses for his birthday and he plays with them daily, including taking them in the bathtub at night and galloping across walls, window seats and tables and they hold up well.  Made for play, for sure!!!!

B009HEJXFS|4.0|I really enjoyed the move I would watch it again and recommend it to my friends and family Thank You
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I loved this movie i thought it was great i loved the palce and faries they  where so colorful and the story was really good
B006Z00R1Q|2.0|This movie was way overrated I really liked 1 and 2 but 3 was not that intense did not have the fear factor of the first 2.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Blu-rays came in a very stylish book-like container. I had no idea it would be so impressive. I gave it as a gift and I will admit I wanted one for myself after seeing how nice it is.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|For the price paid it is a great game. It has a few hiccups, my Android tablet would freeze up during the game, but all I had to do was restart and it was fine. There are multiple levels, brain teaser games, and a decent storyline. I do like Big Fish Games. This one, if you are looking to kill an entire afternoon, (like I did today) this game is worth it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My girls and I love this game it's a great little girl game very easy my girls rage in age 3yrs to7yrs. All can and do play on a daily bases.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it!!! A truely romantic story. Can't wait to read more from Mira Lyn Kelley. It is a well written book.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|HEEE-larious!! Best one-liners ever ... love me some silly slapstick and Randy Quaid is nasty/awesome! Chevy Chase at his finest.
0061906220|5.0|To fully enjoy this book, you need to download the music or check it out on U Tube.  That really brought the story alive for us!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|SAW MOVIE IN THE THEATER WHEN IT CAME OUT IN JUNE 2012.  PURCHASED FOR THE FAMILY FOR CHRISTMAS.  WATCHED THE MOVIE TONIGHT AS A FMILY.  MY HUSBAND REALLY ENJOYED AS IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME SEEING. ESPECIALLY LIKE THE BONUS FEATURE OF &#34;LA LUNA&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely love the premise of this as story. I liked the different twists and turns because the reader is kept guessing. Howey`s characters are well done and develop their depth as the story goes on. THIS STORY NEVER GOES WHERE YOU ASSUME IT'S GOING! It's worth the money and one of the best values I've ever gotten from Amazon.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|It took me a little time to figure out the time out line, but it's a good as every one of its predecessors.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|Anything BEP does is great the whole album makes you want to get up and dance, lyrics are easy to sing to, It os all about the energy of music!!!!!!!
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|a good movie but moves a little slow. Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and was good in this movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am staying up too late every night reading. Great mix of history and engaging characters.  Fast paced writing and the breadth of the story is quite ambitious.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Have read many other Ken Follet novels and this one is just as good as all the rest.  I highly recommend it.
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|I purchased this DVD back in February as a gift for my mother.  It wasnt until December that she decided to open it and watch it.  When she put it in the DVD player, it would not load and the DVD player said &#34;BAD DISC&#34;.  Other DVDs work fine - it is just this disc that will not load/play.  This was a waste of money since I can no longer return or exchange it.  I recommend trying out DVDs as soon as you get them in case you experience the same issue. (On another note: I saw the movie in the theater, and loved it!)
B0053TMP24|5.0|His story lines flow easily from one chapter to the next and the reader stays enthralled.  I highly recommend it.
1451695195|4.0|He makes several points I've never heard about NDEs. Somehow comforting knowing there's something before and after all this. Definitely worth the read, esp. for those coping with loss.

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Worst...movie...ever. This movie makes the best case yet for the need to rate something '0' stars. I would have been far more entertained if my wife just put a sock puppet on her hand and yelled obscenities for half an hour.

B00622B3MY|3.0|Animation is great, the characters are good, the story...not so much.  This sequel just feels contrived in a way that the studio just had to keep the franchise going and came up with a lame big oil story line.  But the kid sure likes seeing Mater.
0307279189|4.0|First and foremost, Born to Run is a great motivational book.  It was recommended to me by a relative which recently went through a very rough bought with cancer and it provides a good amount of motivation on both mental and physical levels.<br /><br />Born to Run is also an enjoyable read.  In addition to the interesting subject matter, locations, and characters it provides many facts and theories on the history and philosophy of running.<br /><br />As a runner I would recommend this book to runners and non-runners alike.
140053271X|2.0|Call me stupid but being that my computer, cheap cell phone and every other media type electronic I have lights up in the dark, I just assumed this did too. It doesn't. I am so sad about this order because I save up for a long time to buy this for my fiance' and now he is stuck with it because they will not let me return it. Very sad.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I like this dictionary because its very helpful when i am in school  It is very helpful to my other siblings they use it all the time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i just love it like it its a must have ... easy to download and easy to use. wish it would come with android phones
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book literally had me in tears! I could not put it down. The connection between them was great. I would definitely recommend it to others.
B005ZUR724|4.0|I had the same issue as many (all?) Android users...the game needed an update in order for me to actually play it, alas Gameloft had no update! (It seems they have no customer support team either) Having paid for the game here, I decided to look for the update elsewhere...(google &quot;Order and Chaos android apk download&quot;)<br /><br />Now that I can play the game on my Kindle Fire Hd...I am happy!  Being a veteran of the MMORPG genre...(mostly CoH , but have looked into WoW, ToR, EQ...most of the populars) this game plays remarkably similar to those games (WoW for certain)...on a portable!<br /><br />Once the controlls are mastered, (not me, not yet) I see no reason this game can't become my fulltime &quot;time drain.&quot;
B0063IH60K|5.0|It' s really good if you like solitaire.  I like the options it offers and the automatic finishing.  I recommend this game.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|the music is good but only 6 little short songs so about 15 minutes of music.  so many great Christmas songs out there and this needs a few more! maybe next year.
0062124293|4.0|I didn't know who Caitlin (pronounced Catlin) Moran was when I started reading this book, but she is a UK music journalist and occasional TV presenter and this is her life story from the perspective of how she evolved from a dorky 13 year old who wanted to be a princess to a genuine, fearlessly feminist woman.  It's frequently amusing and often thought provoking.  I doubt anyone will read this and agree with everything that she thinks, but that's perfectly fine - though I must say, I agreed with most of it.  She's frank, crude, very open about drinking too much and taking drugs at inappropriate times and wildly funny.  I wish she was my friend.<br /><br />In Caitlin Moran's world, men are not the enemy but are simply monopolising the opportunities in society - and women are often as much to blame for this situation as men.  We are the ones who are getting sucked into thinking that botox or brazilians or expensive handbags will somehow make our lives better.  We buy magazines telling us that Jennifer Aniston needs children to complete her or that Kim Kardashian is a feminist role models.<br /><br />Some parts of the book were more interesting for me than others.  I particularly liked the later chapters when she talks about having her children and having an abortion.  They felt more personal, less \\"how can I shock you\\" than some of the earlier segments.<br /><br />This is never going to be a classic in feminist writing, but it's a very entertaining read that makes you think a bit.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded the first of these books for free when I first got my kindle, and I loved it, so my sister got me the omnibus for Christmas. It is a wonderfully written story that keeps you enthralled from beginning to end.
B00APUQYJQ|5.0|I had read Cosmopolis and was excited to hear that Cronenberg was going to take it on.  I love when he chooses something that would seem unfilmable.  His most brilliant stroke was keeping almost all of DeLillo's dialogue from the book intact.  I have to admit that casting Pattinson in the lead role was also a surprisingly good move as Pattinson turns in a performance that's both strong and nuanced. In fairness, though, I thought all of the casting was wonderful with Binoche and Giamatti being the stand-outs for me.  (That last climactic scene between Pattinson and Giamatti is worth the price of the movie right there.)  Cronenberg is not for everyone, nor is DeLillo, but if you like movies that make you think and take you on a bit of a ride (pun intended), this is for you.  This was also the first HD movie I've downloaded (to my new Kindle HD 8.9&#34;) and it looks just fantastic on the screen!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I loved Frankl's perspective on our time here as being a choice of attitude. His account of concentration camp life was heart-stopping and his ability to see light in such a dark time, his ability to pull himself out of such a desperate and sick situation lends hope that I can do the same in my times which can, in no way, compare to his. This book inspired me and shed light on what I might call depression. GREAT read!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Having just had a few sessions, I enjoyed the play and artisstic touches.  I wish there were more explanation on the nonstandard versions that were available, but I haven't tried yet.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Watched it all, but was not that crazy about it, and I usually like movies of this type, but maybe it just wasn't my night for the movies.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I prefer Matt Damon and more action to the Bourne movies.  While it was interesting, it seemed to move too slowly.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|The movie was disappointing, sadly.  Didn't really answer my questions, or my friends who watched it with me, about the origins of The Aliens. It kind of does but there were so many loopholes that we were both disappointed.
B007V65R54|4.0|I am not overly technical but I like to understand the science behind things.  Why they work and don't work.  This book does a good job of being just technical enough to describe the science but not lose the reader to the jargon .<br />I learned something, which for me is the goal.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is just a wonderful movie no matter how you cut it.  The actors they gathered for this movie can't be beat and that shows up big time.  Still love the saying the young son who owns the hotel stated near the beginning:  &#34;In India we have a saying, Everything will be alright in the end and if it is not, then it isn't the end.&#34; ...or words to that effect if I don't have them verbatim.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved the movie Howl's Moving Castle, so was very excited to find out that it was based on a book! The book and move start out similarly, but as is often the case, the book is so much better than the movie. The book explores so many great themes that I can discuss with my kids: duty vs. personal fulfillment, youth and beauty vs. age, perception vs. reality, gender roles and their reversals. I have re-read and re-heard this story many times, and each time I notice some new detail that makes the story's complex plot hold together even more tightly. Diana Wynne Jones' writing is wonderful, imaginative, and economical--and Howl's Moving Castle is one of her best works.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I love MIB and MIB 2 so ordered this. Problem is I've yet had a chance to watch it with the holidays and all that goes with it. However, I know I'm going to love it when I do finally get a chance to watch it.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|We have enjoyed adding this movie to our collection.  The variety of birds represented is wonderful -- the music, singing and the art is a feast for the eyes.
0792846338|5.0|Kathy Bates plays a good part as a crazy fan.  It keeps you on the edge wondering what she is going to do next.  I would not recommend for younger children.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie has had a great impact on us -- the true story of a girl who suffered a great tragedy, but only allowed it to make her stronger in her faith and her compassion for others.  We appreciated that the girl this movie is based on, was an integral part of the filming process, so she was able to make sure the truth of her story was really communicated.  Great movie to have in our collection.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|An excellent addition to Lana Del Rey's already great repertoire! I've been listening to this almost every day since it has come out!
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|After studying Robin Hood in school, we were looking for a dramatization that was not too intense or violent for 5 and 7 year olds.  This Errol Flynn version is light hearted and funny, communicating the fun elements of the legend.  Love the optimism of movies from this period, even if they are &#34;unrealistic&#34; to some degree.
B001TOD9VI|4.0|Entertaining movie, love Marissa's scene ! Mmmhhmmm Besides her great scenes its still pretty good check it out. Im not a huge fake wrestling fan but it shows what its like for these crazy guys when they arent big and famous anymore
B001HN6922|5.0|We are fans of the Cars story lines, and characters.  So we were excited to get this copy added to our collection.  It has probably been watched, now over 30 times.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I had a slow start - You think that with solitare, would be very simple.  I didn't see any directions for the very beginner of online games.  It took a few plays to get to get the hang of it - Then it was OK
B009YU62H2|5.0|Chris Cornell shouts he's \\"Been Away Too Long\\" on the opening track of this amazing reunion album and I couldn't agree more. Hearing Soundgarden was back together sounded like a dream come true - fortunately the album does too. I've seen people say everything from \\"awesome\\" to \\"sounds like 'Down on the Upside.'\\" The indictment that Soundgarden sounds like they are picking up where they left off is not a criticism at all. For me, it's the greatest compliment possible that after over a decade of being apart, they have come back together as the solid rock machine they were through the 90s. They are titans in the same league as rock legends Led Zeppelin in my book, and they continue to hold that spot now. Cornell's voice is still outstanding. Thayil is still a guitar wizard. Matt Cameron still knows how to bring it on drums. Ben Shepherd is...wow...this guy just is an integral part of the sound, and he has not lost his touch either. Standout tracks...well, first let me say there is not a single throw away track on this masterpiece. Favs are \\"Non-State Actor\\", \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\", \\"Bones of Birds\\" and \\"Taree.\\" However, I could list every track. They are all 4s and 5s. Right now at this moment, the album is only $3.99 for download - how can you pass it up? Best money I've spent all year for what could be THE rock album of 2012.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I love &#34;Castle&#34; on TV.  But if there really were a Richard Castle, he would have to write better stories than this to keep in print.  It is fun to see the interplay between Nikki Heat and her associate.  But to one who reads a lot of mystery novels, this one is rather shallow.  If your exposure to whodunnits is primarily from TV, this series might make a good introduction to mystery literature.  But from this starting point, move on to Ed McBain, Sara Paretsky, or Rex Stout.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|JOURNEY<br /><br />Journey's gotten rave reviews, and for once they're well deserved. The game is the antithesis of games like Call of Duty. The game has a unique mixture of stunning graphics, emotive soundtrack, and wordless storytelling. The entire goal of the game is to reach a mountain peak. However, everything from the graphics, music, and stage are timed perfectly to evoke a wide range of emotions, from fear to exhaustion to relief. It an incredible experience. Even though it's a short game, it's a journey worth taking.<br /><br />FLOWER<br /><br />Surprisingly fun. All you do is fly around as a flower petal collecting other flowers. However, the graphics and colors are stunningly rich. The red, yellow, and blue petals flying over green grass are a joy to watch.<br /><br />FLOW<br /><br />In this game, you're a protist in water eating other protists. It's a cute game, but the swimming controls aren't intuitive. It really takes some getting used to. Also, while well designed, it's not as visually stimulating as the other games.<br /><br />COLLECTOR'S EDITION<br /><br />Journey is a short game, but the company that made it really put a lot of love into this collector's edition set. This pack comes with all three games, as well as developer commentaries, soundtracks, artwork, and much more. It frankly puts Nintendo's anniversary editions of games such as Mario and Zelda to shame.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|Very good app definatly deserves 5 stars an awesome game just like Mario 4 works great on a kindle fire
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.<br /><br />Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.<br /><br />Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.<br /><br />As much as I like individual episodes, the meta-plot as a whole is somewhat ridiculous. My eyes glazed over whenever the show ventured into pseudo-religious nonsense. I have nothing against religion, but the use of religious metaphors in BSG was always a bit too on the nose. Oddly, the show doesn't use religion to talk about morality, in the way that Star Trek was often a series of morality plays, but rather as plot devices. By Season 2, the president is running around looking for Earth based on religious prophecies. Meanwhile, everybody proclaims that the baby of a human and Cylon is the \\"sign of things to come\\" without ever explaining the baby's significance to the audience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. To put it bluntly,they're boring and not particularly threatening after the first few episodes. The idea of biological machines is never really explained satisfactorily - the Cylons appear to be exact copies of humans, even feeling human emotions, and act nothing like machines. Yet, they're supposed to be machines bent on conquering humans? The male Cylons are portrayed as boring and dull while the female Cylons are either slutty or overly emotional. As the series goes on, the Cylons are shown to be a bunch of goofy religious fanatics and the threat factor is almost completely eliminated.<br /><br />Cyborgs or machines impersonating humans can work to great effect when they are used as a plot device to talk about the human condition, as in Blade Runner or with Data in Star Trek, or about the dangers of technology. However, BSG doesn't take either approach - its Cylons are just a bunch of emo thugs oddly obsessed with religious prophecies.<br /><br />Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like the larger story or the Cylons. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|This ep is really good. The artist did a good job with the four songs that are on this EP. I think she is going to be an amazing rap artist. We need more female rap artist like this. She is not a commercial artist or radio artist but her songs could be used on commercials and radios. I think if she keep making the upbeat rap/r&b songs like she did on this album she should be fine.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|As good or better than when we saw it at the movie theater. It was a long coming but definitely worth the wait.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|So happy to have purchased this book on Kindle. I'm enjoying every minute of it. Great writing form, it is so easy to relate! Thanks for writing such an enjoyable book.

1608871517|5.0|If you are a fan, you will *love* this book. If you are not a fan, you will *love* this book.<br />It's not just about MJ, it's about a commitment to quality and a job exceptionally well done.<br />People who will love this book include: MJ fans (of course), fashion designers (or hopefuls), textiles students, history buffs, culture erudites, trivia fans, fans of over all quality and book collectors.<br /><br />The book itself is of the highest quality, something nearly lost in this age of e-formatted data. The colors are so vibrant. The photography is GREAT! The picture quality is awe-inspiring. The paper quality is superb. MJ would have been very proud of this piece. Mr. Bush says in the book, that MJ always meant to produce such a book and I hope he is being truthful because it tells all his wardrobe secrets. One of the best things about this production is that it covers 25 years with Michael. From the \\"Bad\\" years, all the way up to and after his death. Most books written by people who claim to be friends of MJ were clearly estranged from him for at least the last decade of his life. Not so here.<br /><br />For me, the most valuable part of the book was at the very end where they shared the suit MJ was laid to rest in. I never thought I'd ever get to see it. It's so beautiful and absolutely fit for a king.<br /><br />The chapter of unfinished works are heartbreaking and of course, his account of how and when he got the news that MJ was gone was heart wrenching and then the call he got from LaToya asking that he decide what Michael was to be laid to rest in. Then being told by the mortician that the family requested that he dress Michael. I can only imagine what was going through his mind. To be trusted to handle this last task for this extremely private man. Wow!<br /><br />Clearly, Michael was obsessed with British royalty, military leadership and aristocratic passtimes and it showed in his wardrobe. It absolutely could be argued that he was quite full of himself, but one cannot deny his effect on the fashion world and his personal committment to quality and perfectionism. He expected, and many times got, perfection from his wardrobe design staff.<br /><br />Based on what I've read about MJ's finances later in life, I really do hope that Messrs Bush & Tompkins got paid well for their last task for The King of Pop. I love MJ with all my heart but I have to confess that he must have been a pain to work for at times. His perfectionism showed in his wardrobe and Micheal and Dennis were up to the charge every time.<br /><br />Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that Bush & Tompkins auctioned these pieces off to the public but I can't fault them for that. Michael always told them to get credit for their art. How ever they chose to do that is up to them.<br /><br />Rest well, MJ and Dennis and thank you, Mr. Bush for sharing this with the world., but one cannot deny his effect on the fashion world and his personal committment to quality and perfectionism.

B009LXEBD4|4.0|I like the Kelly Clarkson Greatest Hits-Chaper One because it contained all the songs I enjoy and was a good price.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I Love it.  The pictures are very clear.  Just have to get used to taking them  without looking through a view finder.
B004YM6JI2|3.0|Better than previous couple of season of the series, if you are a collector it's worth buying, extras are good.
B004QSQML8|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD/ blue ray. I can't wait to watch it again with my kids. Even family has already asked to barrow it.
B001FB4W0C|4.0|first half of this series is amazing, second part not so much but if you like Supernatural this iss worth buying. It's for collector.
0345803485|1.0|I recently picked up this book at the airport, I thought I'd give it a chance considering the hype. Well, this just goes to show that most people don't know a damn thing! Why this type of literature is praised and so many other brilliant and worthy works go unnoticed I'll never understand.<br /><br />First off, the author seems to have limited sexual experience herself. If you're going to write erotica, please know what you're talking about. The writing was definitely in the style of Twilight. I did not know this book was Twilight fan fiction, knowing that fact beforehand would have kept me from reading this garbage.<br /><br />I honestly think the reason this book is popular is because of its decent cover art, and I did appreciate the musical references. But in a nutshell buy this trilogy if your a lonely housewife, even then I'd recommend just staring at the pool boy with a cocktail than reading this poo...this 50 Shades of Poo!
B002JVWRAO|3.0|this is not the best season of the series but it's worth buying nonetheless if you like Supernatural. It's for collector.
0743233832|3.0|The book its self is great. This translation is lacking in many ways. I purchased this volume, put it down and ordered Maxiwell Staniforths translation and got a FAR better volume in translation as well as in quality of printing.
B003L77GGK|3.0|this is not the best season of the series but it's worth buying nonetheless if you like Supernatural. It's for collector.
B000XYEJ0U|5.0|This is a fantastic book and a valued addition to my personal library! The seller described it in FAR less detail than they should have. The book is absolutely PERFECT! Great speed in shipping and a more than reasonable price as well. I was very excited to recieve the volume today and have already gone through most of it! I actually broke the spine for the first time by its look! I WILL BUY from this seller again in coming days. THANK YOU!!
B004QX07G4|1.0|sucks a lot  sucks a bunch  sucks a=s sucks more sucks big time  sucks more than you sucks major sucks total sh=t  sucks bad sucks looser sucks lol sucks yo mama  sucks #1 sucks the worst  sucks crap  sucks badddd  sucks laugh  sucks royal sucks grande sucks!!!
B005JABSB6|3.0|These glasses are a bit front heavy and feel a bit awkward on your face, however they do work really well when watching a 3D BlueRay movie.  They are also supposed to have the ability to downgrade a 3D movie to 2D for people whom don't like 3D viewing, however I haven't tested that feature yet.  The charging time is about an hour for them and will last at least 30 days without use, and go through at least 2 full length movies at a time.  They charge via micro USB, and this don't use batteries.  My only real compliant is the the nose bridge piece feel very strange on my face when I wear them and makes me feel kind of disorientated.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It definitely keeps you glued to the book.  Has a good plot to it.  For those who like to read, go for it.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Physics games have been around for a while, and this one uses the same concepts you may already know.There was no tutorial mode to get you going. Once I figured out how to drag and build, it became much easier. Read the signs! cute but not as informative as could be...and sometimes misleading. Was better on the tablet than on the phone. Several challenging levels so far! Different colored goo do different things. I got it as the free app of the day, and while I have some paid apps, $5 for a game is a little higher than I would have been willing to go otherwise. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could give halves.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It  a great and easy game.  I have even won.  It was free toooo.  You should get it and soon.
0399247459|5.0|I wanted to make sure to get a large enough copy so I made sure to check the measurements - this one was great! I love the finished product. Haven't used the cd and not sure if I will, but it might be nice to have.
B00536OCYG|5.0|Christmas present for my 19 year old granddaughter and she was thrilled.  She is at Sullivan Culinary and really into vinyl.  The posters were an added bonus.
031250926X|5.0|This is a large board book with the sliding piece. It is a great classic story and I love the way this is formatted.
B0027MJU00|5.0|She always knows how to keep me glued to my book. Finished it in a day of reading on the plane. Well done.
B0049OSQ18|4.0|One of the best bands going, but not one of their top few albums. Kinda short, too. Still, love them!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Graphic are smooth and clean. My son &amp; myself are totally addicted to this game. Nice one Glu. Just wish gold coins were easier to obtain, I like the sales the game has every now and then to upgrade items for cheap.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|I loved her music since I saw her perform one of the songs on this album on a music channel.  It takes me to a nice relaxed state of being.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This installment of angry birds is as much fun to play as the others. I actually enjoyed it more because of the ability to bend lines with the gravity. Really fun game and series.
B00886XQO0|3.0|If I had it to do over again, I'd just buy the $200 set. These sound great but they are not easily programmed and they love to cut themselves off after a brief period of inactivity. The bluetooth works good but don't bother trying to pair to your phone while trying to do gameplay. They don't mesh very well. It's annoying more than useful. Battery life is decent. Satisfied with performance but not worth the price.
0446580848|5.0|I really enjoy the author's insight and research performed to support the story.<br />If you haven't read a Nelson Demille story...give it a try....
140053271X|5.0|I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!  It arrived very quickly and in great shape.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Kids loved it. I didn't care for it with all the zombies and body parts falling off.I wouldn't let them watch it again.
159240488X|5.0|I ordered this book as a prerequisite for a Composition that I was attending in college.<br /><br />It arrived early and in excellent condition.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Have not seen as many ads as this game puts out yes I know it's free but the amount of ads may get it deleted
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best science fiction I read in a long time. A very enjoyable read with great characters, good story and well written. It's a shame books like these are hard to find.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|** spoiler alert ** I finished reading Wool early this morning with mixed feelings.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a very good story. When I started reading it, I couldn't put the book down: I had to read more about the residents of Silo 18, their way of life, and I wanted to know what happened to the world. As the story continued though through the books, information about what really happened became more and more scarce and I felt Howey left details out, letting my imagination do the rest.<br /><br />This might not be too bad if you read Wool as a suspense story and want to know about the characters; but if you're after answers, and you want to know what really happened, you will be disappointed. Howey never delivers.<br /><br />A few of the most burning questions in the series are what is the benefit of cleaning (technically speaking),Why wool,where does IT gets its power from, and how come there are computers fully running in the silos where the rest of the habitats working medieval jobs such as farming, taking care of huge machines and transporting information (porting) by foot. There's a big gap between the different people of the silo in terms of culture and knowledge, which makes the story overall unrealistic.<br /><br />The story also suffers from a slight identity crisis. You think you're reading a future post-apocalyptic tale, but in fact, there's very little going on there. There's suspense, but at the same time, you can guess what happened or bw disappointed with \\"duh\\" solution Howey invents out of thin air (suddenly there are huge machines used for digging; there are radios they could use; there's a hidden floor hiding volumes of history). There's romance, but the characters you read about in the first story are mere shadows in the later books (you are left asking yourself why you even bothered with the first 2 books, they could be skipped entirely)<br /><br />However, perhaps this is also because I am struggling to write myself and I know what ittakes, I appreciate what the author tried to do and the world he built. It is interesting, has a lot of potential, and it is the first tale in months that captured my mind in a way that forced me to give up sleep and read any chance I got. Perhaps a bit disappointed, but satisfied, I would still recommend this book.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Best tower defense yet. I absolutely love the multiple upgrade paths. Definitely worth the money! Go and buy it right now you'll be glad you did.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|The Bourne story line is fascinating to me.  I liked how they integrated this story into the existing Bourne universe.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner did a awesome job and the supporting cast was interesting to watch as well.  Edward Norton bugs me for some reason, but his role was executed well.<br /><br />Great movie for spy thriller buffs.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Grandson thought this was just too cool....he and his brother both wanted it, but they found a way to negotiate a trade.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It took me a while to get interested in the story,about a third of the way in. But after getting used go the style of writing its hard to put down.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|this is a great fun game that keeps your interest for a long time.  Fun for all ages.  Highly reccomended
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After seeing the movie, I had  to read the book.  The book  provides  more insight into  the history behind the Hunger Games.  Well written and hard to put down.
B000641D2Y|5.0|There aren't many sequels that are as good as the original (Home Alone 3, 4, 5, and beyond? Those are some prime examples of sequels that don't need to exist). Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is equally as good as the first. The goons are hilarious and stupid but not annoying. You really want them around as they are critical for this movie to be good. The little hero is so smart and clever. Always one step ahead of the moron criminals! The crooks get beaten (quite literally to a thousand violent deaths, if this were real life). Hilarious, quotable, and watchable for any day of the year. How about every day of the year? I've seen it literally hundreds of times and I will watch it hundreds more.<br />100/100
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read this book twice.  Anna and Christian captured my heart in this book!  I love how she stands up to him and how much he tries.  James' has a way of bringing the characters to life!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|What treat to see this superbly cast, photograhed, and directed movie.  Each character was presented in depth with backgrounds and emotions and then tied with others in a well put together storyline.  The mainly elderly cast was physically shown as they were with wrinlkles and flaws.  Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton were outstanding.  The Indian scenery was so artfully done that you felt as if you were actually there with the jostling crowds, sounds, smells and color.<br />TAKE TIME TO PUT THIS AT THE TOP OF YOUR BUCKET LIST!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I started this book as a sample and fell in love!  The twists and turns in this book kept me turning the pages!
B000Q67876|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, found this deal on Amazon and decided to jump on it.<br /><br />The package was well put together and had a few extras I wasn't expecting.Great HD quality too which is a huge benefit to revisiting an older movie.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Long holiday travels require a good book. This wasn't it. The storyline was a bit entertaining once you got passed the cheapness of the writing. Unfortunately it has the worst ending. The author couldn't figure out how to tie the winding story together she created and just gave up.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Awesome screen. If you realize it portable and not to replace your home tv you will love it. Easy hook up right out of the box.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A fast and very delightful read. We really have no true concept of time or life's purpose.  Thankfully Mitch Albom can eloquently show us what life is really like, without watching it slip through our hand as sand in our own hour glass
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Because it made me laugh and I liked how he did the who likes who thing it was cute! I recommend this to middle school kids and elementary kids too!
B001O03NCW|5.0|I really enjoy this album. It's got good vocals and unique songs. A great soundtrack to add to your music collection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|In the English dictionary or any dictionary for that matter there absolutely no word to describe how this book made me feel and although anyone reading this review who hasn't read the book it must sound like I'm going over board here which admittedly I might, but it just that good . Any they only way you describe the book with catching every last thought feelings and new perspective is simplest put in the the once thought to be over used with no real meaning and defining aspect.  NO WORDS cause maybe the best WORDS to describe something is none at all.  Just the simple silence of the unspoken word of us all can truly describe this book.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Demigod one of the most artfully brutal albums in existence, captures the imagination in terms of ferocity. Their is a distinct cultural sound that is unique to each song ranging from roman trumpets to Arabic styled guitar play and Egyptian influence as well.<br /><br />The group represents with great intensity the beliefs of Thelema (the group that is most related to Aleister Crowley). With this in mind, you will learn immensely in regards to the religion which makes this album an educational experience as well.<br /><br />Now back to the nit and gritty. Slaves shall serve one of my favorite songs ever is transition phenomenally in this album as the prior song's ending fits into this song's intro. This is not only done in Slaves Shall Serve, but with every song of the album. This does not mean the songs are the same in the least. That's the problem with Evangelion but not demigod. Each song is as unique as is a county, that is because each has various cultural melodies that defines the backbone of each song.<br /><br />At the end of the day, few albums in my mind can boast the transitional excellence of this album while having each individual song unique and powerful. Each song on its own is a treat as it is formed fully with a distinct intro, climax and interlude. However, if you listen to this album without stopping. Well hell itself will orgasm in joy as like I said each song transitions as if they were destined to follow one another.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I think that it is a great book. You just have to pay attention to all the little details. But in all it was a really great book. I highly recommend this book.
B000ID37T0|5.0|A great movie; amazing performance from Al Pacino. The storyline was compelling, the characters rang true, and the plot was extremely interesting and nuanced.
B005HSL626|5.0|Yes! This game is so fun to play when you are bored. Me and my friends play this game all the time.
0545425115|5.0|The only thing better about the movie than the book in Jennifer Lawrence, I watched the movie and loved it, then I read this book and loved the story even more
159102594X|5.0|Interesting characters, suspense, twists, great villains and heroes, but is anyone a real hero in this series? Or a real villain (well, OK, there are a few). I highly recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy and wants something with a twist.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This was a great film for the whole family.  It had tons of laughs and kept us entertained throughout.  Would recommend for kids of all ages and grownups too!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|This is a stand alone novel about some characters we have seen before in Abercrombe novels. I won't spoil it, but it is a great sequel to the earlier novels and series. The combination of steampunk (sort of) medieval and other eras, like the wild west, etc. makes for an entertaining mash-up of genres. I would not give it a five, as it is just not that good but it is a worthy read.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Me and my  husband love this series and for the price it was a great buy to add to our collection.
1455527475|4.0|Very good writing, good overview, entertaining and dramatic story.  Ok, so Wall Street isn't ethical.  But please, don't leave us hanging, which is why I rated the book 4 stars instead of 5.  What does this savvy financial expert recommend for people who pull out of the stock/bond/fund markets, and want to invest their money elsewhere?  What should that \\"elsewhere\\" be for the average Joe out there?
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Of all the Will Ferrell movies this is by far my favorite, it incorporates comedy into the mundane life of a tax man, who finds himself the lead in someone else’s fictional story.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|This book is typical Baldacci writing.  Keeps you interested in the next mini-mystery, of which there are many.  Over all the story is highly unbeleivable, but still entertaining.  There are so many twists and turns you never get bored.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|This movie was purchased for my son for Christmas but after putting it into the DVD player it was not long before the whole family was sitting down watching it together.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|As a first time tablet user, it was difficult to figure out whether my kindle fire hd was using the battery charge faster than usual and i sent my first one back for a replacement. Someone recommended this app and it's great. Tells you the amount of time left for each activity like music, reading, movies. Diagnoses battery health. Gives you how long a full charge will take. I liked the free version and bought the pro version. Both are excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first book that I have ever read that I could not put down.  I literally read it in one day!!! Can't wait to read the next two!
B002M7A79S|5.0|Firefly was a great show (hate it was cancelled) and this is a great movie!  Jose Whedon is a master story teller.
0920668372|5.0|For years, I bought this book for all my nieces, nephews and family friends. The older I get, the more precious the story is.<br /><br />Shared this last book with a friend, mailed directly to her from seller and EVERYTHING went well.<br /><br />THANK YOU!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using Evernote since version 1 was in Beta and never looked back. I have changed computers and devices several times and, everytime that happens, this is the first app I install.  Just can't live without it, so much so,  I paid for  a Premium account.<br /><br /> Evernote is my go to app for journaling, writing, saving articles I want to read later, organizing my tasks -GTD style, planning, blogging, sketching ideas, storing important information, you name it, I do it with Evernote, which have help me to be totally paperless.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a good build your city  kind of game. It is easily understandable and has an enjoyable battle simulation.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and very addicting. it's really exciting to play. however there does seem to be a bit a plateau to the gameplay. I've gotten to about 2,200m, but I just can't seem to run any farther! ...maybe it's just me. overall a great game and would definitely recommend.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I missed this in the theater, streamed when got the chance and enjoyed it much more than anticipated. To me, this is more of a cultural studies documentary. It shows the life that has been and still is of a man's hard driven philosophy of work. To him, work is not simply a job.. It is a way of life, an acceptance of being. His unconventional philosophies and strict mindset have earned him accolades in his field of craft, which begs the question, is he the best due to his master skills or simply because he has earned the right after 75 years of blood, sweat and tears? Perhaps all of the above. A fascinating look at one man's idea of 'life's work'. I would feel honored to experience Jiro's sushi.
B004NFB4EO|5.0|What else can i say about the Lady Gaga. She is amazing! Excellent single and great lyrics. fast and expedient.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game a lot. Like super Mario but cuter with better graphics. Plus its free which is rad.
0300169787|5.0|Saw the exhibition in NY and was completely blown away... so worth the 3 hour waiting line (which was pretty moderate from what I gather). This book will be a constant reminder and testimony of my favorite exhibition by far.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app got me running everywhere, in line at the store, in the parking lot, during commercials, at the beach, on the road when I stop on my Harley, in restaurants. This is CRAZY! but lovin it. Went nuts when I hit 3 million :-D ha-ha
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great film!  Especially, omage to robin in the end.  Cat women was great and Bain character was good as well
B004UID2LC|5.0|So many topics to choose from for whatever mood you're in, Love the DIYF on there, music lessons and everything else you can think of. Keep it safe, thanks
B004JMY312|4.0|Cute, family-friendly movie with McGee from NCIS  :)  I was curious to see what he was like as a younger actor!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great app, good for the mind, great pass time. Only wish I'd win more against the computer, ha ha :-D
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Excellent show with great acting, costume, and set design.  I wish it was longer, but I loved the way they ended it!
B002G1ZHNQ|5.0|I've been playing guitar for a long time, but still never fully understood the instrument as far as scales, modes and patterns. With Guitar Fretboard there's some light at the end of the tunnel. Now I'm using what I already know and applying it to some of the exercises in the book. Keep on Praising His Name!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I couldn't put it down!  I enjoyed it so much that I sent it to my niece for her birthday.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series. Its just great. If you like mythology, adventure, and a little romance, read this book!<br />It's a great read!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|worked good first time and very easy to install.will be a very popular app when i'm traveling around on my
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book relates to the thoughts some teenagers go through. Its a wonderful book and movie, I do recommend readers discretion, since the book does have drugs and alcohol activities. Overall I loved this book.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|The Play First Dash series are the most fun & addicting games. Honestly, it's a great way to take your mind off of the worries of the world. That is, of course, if you have the time to spare. Enjoy...they're all fun!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|We were pleasantly delighted how good a third movie of MEN IN BLACK was.  Funny, touching and a real delight.  I am buying this one!!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I waited for &#34;Dark Knight&#34; to arrive on PPV purposely, because being a fan of most of the Batman flicks and experiencing loud, unruly behavior in theaters by kids and adults who act like kids - such as texting, talking, passing gas, laughing and just annoying behavior overall, I waited anxiously for Dark Knight's arrival to Amazon, so that I could enjoy it in the privacy and peacefulness of my own home.<br /><br />Clearly this flick was made to be seen on the big screen because the sound throughout the entire movie was 'off', muffled voices, music loud in some scenes and barely heard in others.<br /><br />The acting (acting?) was well, less than professional and the plot was painfully predictable. The worse character was Bain, after about 15 minutes into the movie I was hoping desperately that he would remove that stupid, childish NOT-frightening  mask, so he (Bain) *may* have been a bit less boring. In my opinion, Dark Knight is a Batman &#34;wanabe&#34; and in the most desperate way and I found myself wishing that I had in fact seen this movie in a noisy theater, at least the typical unchecked rudeness of others would have probably provided much more 'entertainment' than the Dark Knight. Oh, did I mention I'm also NOT a fan of Christian Bale?
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything I need at my fingertips with this app on my Uniden 7&#34; tablet. When I turn it on, the weather is already displayed, and when I want more info I can open the app and view forecasts for anywhere, as well as satellite.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|For those who see all tose Batman movies before, this trilogy is the best!! Every movie have the best sound and efffects to integrate yourself to the pictures and is a non stop action always.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|My husband is big on romantic comedy but he laughed just as much as I did. Most Ladies and Gentlemen should enjoy this one.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|What I didn't like was having to wait until the price came down to rent it. It was going for $15 (I guess to buy it) when I only wanted to watch it. I didn't like feeling made to buy it.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Husband isn't usually much for sci fi type flicks but he really seemed to enjoy this one. I'm surprised it didn't do a little better at the box office than it did.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|I really didn't like it, thought it was juvenile and tasteless. A little too heavy on the inuendoes and forced jokes.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Some people liked. Some people didn't. Over all both hubby and I enjoyed. I would have preferred some other type of ending to the movie.
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|Bought this movie without having seen it beforehand, and is certainly not as good as reviewed. Pretty lame when one of your ongoing themes is about puke, really, not funny, gross. Rebel Wilson is awesome, she's funny. But the others, tried their best. There was no romantic chemistry with Anna Kendrick's character, and I just didn't feel it. Missed the mark
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Perfect interpretation of a teenage dance experience.jeff Kinney is pure genius. Great as always, can't wait for the next one!!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Number 1 on the list of favorites, 4-1/2 stars, \\"hilariously funny\\",and fairly interesting trailer.  Being a grandmother, I intuitively felt that this movie was not for me, but everything that I saw regarding it, placed it in a positive entertainment context.  There was talent involved, but this was not a very good movie.  It was just good, but barely.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very well written, very detailed, without becoming cumbersome. This is a book everybody can read, it's catalogued as \\"science fiction\\" but I think there is nothing that stands in the way for it to be a book for the general public. And I think it's time that some translation in other languages are made.
B00000HXFL|5.0|Baby Breeze, to me, is one of Chet's greatest recordings. The bonus tracks are very revealing, for example, how 'I wish You Love' evolved into the chosen take on the original release.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|very addicting game was not sure about it at first . but love it and my son also loves it as well
B0058VW36U|5.0|This little fellow can be complicated creature will not be happy if you don't give him his candy! So give him his candy.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|Joni is a gifted artist, both visually and musically.  Her songwriting is epic and broad and diverse.  Her visual art pieces are fine compliments to her canon of poetry and music.  I feel blessed to have heard her.
B009INAKM8|1.0|I know their last record failed missearbly but there is no excuse for this blatent money grab. This recording has not changed in the least. I would keep your money and get some other tunes. Placebo's initial re-mastered albumn is a fantastic choice. The song lengths are even the same. Very odd, and frustrated. This is the only review I have written after a decade of purchases.
B0086449YA|5.0|A remarkable story teller and song smith, an outstanding guitarist who works with excellent band mates and creates a double album rich with ear magnetizing sounds, words, melodies, accompaniments, and orchestrations.  Thanks, MK for adding to the beauty of existence.  Shame on Warner for not bending over backwards to get this 2 CD album released in the US.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app just works for me. I use it all the time. Get it - you won't be sorry you did.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Brad Pitt and Jonas Hill make a great duo!  Brad, typical Sagittarius that he is, shows us how to live outside the box and deliver unorthodox solutions.  I said from the very first time I saw Brad in A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT that, &#34;that boy is going to be a monster star.&#34;<br /><br />Daughter of a producer looked at me skeptically and said, &#34;you think?&#34;<br /><br />Now we don't think, we know.<br /><br />His Moon in Capricorn is brilliantly shown when he says, &#34;when you get the answer you want, hang up!&#34;  Soooo Cap!<br /><br />Jonas plays the brilliant side kick who shows a disarmingly charming ability to be vulnerable and authentic while still being sharp and insightful.  That's quite a character to integrate and he does it so effortlessly that his true talent shines!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Got this game for free with daily free app and it is awesome since I would have never spent mode than 99 cents on a phone game and it is $5. Love this game...it's fun.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|pretty cool game, wish there was more of a story line though :/ I wish that and that only, please make more games!!!
B007TML4EI|5.0|I very much enjoyed this game and hope another is made soon - it follows the same guidelines as simple physics, but is a much better game.
B008XG1X18|3.0|A little hard fo me  to navigate, but I am a newcomer and 85 years old, so it takes time for me to learn new procedures.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I loved this game on Wii, but the developers only ported the game to android, they left out any kind of UI optimization. Some menus are small and hard to see and touch. Besides that the game runs quite smoothly. Fix the  UI and I would rate 5 stars.
B00004R99M|5.0|it is an excellent movie, very enjoyable. i love the music and the acting. julie andrews is an excellent actress
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put it down....it was great....such a fun suspenseful ride.  Wish there were more to read just like it.
034580404X|5.0|i have several friends who just rave about how good this book is. one said she would only tell me it has a&#34; red room&#34;.  so i had to purchase the set to find out for myself.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle just gets better all the time. The stories are always fun to watch whether the episode is more playful or more serious. Nathan Fillion (Firefly and Serenity) and Stana Katic (Quantum of Solace, For Lovers Only) are marvelous as the series leads, but the show has a phenomenal supporting cast as well.<br /><br />Even if you haven't seen or don't own the earlier seasons, this is still an excellent investment. The episodes are strong but filled with humor. Castle brings his humorous twists to the crimes, yet often through his writer's eye he can see past &#34;just the facts&#34; to reach other not-so-obvious conclusions -- conclusion that often lead to catching the bad guy or girl.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes crime dramas, mysteries, sexual tension between characters, unusual bad guys, and an odd couple solving crime together. Oh yeah, and anyone who has a funny bone! This is humor and drama mixed at its best!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This had lots of under statements and so little meaning  about the word which i look in this dictionary to understand words in my books so now i have to download a more understanding dictionary  :(
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is the movie created after Firefly the series was cancelled; however, the show has a strong enough cult following to demand the movie be made to bring needed answers to the mysteries of the series.<br /><br />Serenity is a marvelous piece of writing, and the cast is fantastic. It wraps up the gaps left open and gives closure.<br /><br />This is a great fit for someone who likes westerns as this has a cowboy feel to it. It's also a great fit to the true science fiction lovers. There are moments reminiscent of Han Solo hollering for Chewbacca to bring him tools while he's trying desperately trying to fix the Millennium Falcon. The scenery has a hint of Dune due to the desert setting only. There is a moment near the end with a surprise as big as Darth Vader's, &#34;Luke...I am your father.&#34;<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little different and a lot of fun, this is your collection to buy.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  It was fast paced and kept me looking forward to what was going to happen next.
B0053O89IS|5.0|In many series, when the two lead characters finally give into a romance, it spells the end of the show (remember Moonlight, and Remington Steel?). This is NOT the case with Booth and Bones. Somehow their relationship adds to the series.<br /><br />Perhaps this is because their relationship hasn't changed. They're still Bones and Booth. They haven't changed, and the writers don't play up the mushy stuff. The show is still about the crime solving; the relationship just makes it better. It's been fun to watch the emotional changes in Bones. It's good to see her laugh.<br /><br />This series, and this season are excellent!
B009738XXM|4.0|I'm not an expert on music, but I really like Jepsen's music and the consistent sound of her music. She included some other famous musicians like Justin Bieber and Adam Young (Owl City) and regardless of what you think of them as people, they added a nice touch to her music.
B003L77G8I|5.0|This series continues to get better all the time as the characters come together and form an intensely loyal and devoted crew of &#34;squints&#34; (all the scientists of the Jeffersonian) and FBI agents (primarily our honor-filled and trustworthy Booth). The writer's continue to create their signature &#34;messy messes with mangled body parts&#34; that still brings a cringe to your expression on occasion.<br /><br />In this season, Bones and the Jeffersonian suffer a horrible, heart wrenching loss which sends the profoundly lost and confused Bones to Booth's apartment late the night of the loss. Her trip forever changes the relationship she shares with Booth. Changes that can't help but spill into season 7.<br /><br />I would recommend this show to those who like crime drama spiced with humor; also to those who like science. There's a lot of science explained on the show -- I have been able to answer 3 tough Jeopardy questions just because I watch Bones! :-) :-)<br />I would recommend this show to people who like a good ensemble cast and multiple sub-stories going on. The supporting cast is tremendous. The show has a huge talent pool within it's wall.s<br /><br />Give this show a try!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is not a review on the movies, but on the product.<br /><br />The case has a very nice, almost &#34;peach-fuzzy&#34; feel to it, and the cover art is very nice, despite people bashing it. This product comes with 5 Blu-ray discs, of which 3 are the movies and the other 2 are bonus. The booklet of photos is a nice addition to this product, although I did not find myself greatly attracted to actually looking through it. Overall a great product that provides the buyer fantastic visual, audio, and spiritual enlightenment and pleasure.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a marvelous series that caught the hearts of many. It's lead character Mal, a man with a sad an tragic past, leads a small ragtag crew of faithfuls to stay alive in the new era lead by the (evil) Alliance. They take any job that comes their way (legal or not) and run into trouble at every turn.<br /><br />I like the description &#34;Space Cowboys&#34; to describe the show. There is a western feel to it combine with technology 500 years in the future.<br /><br />If you have any qualms about buying, get rid of them. This series is excellent and can be good family fun. Buy it and enjoy!
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Very intense and entertaining movie.  Although they are fighting against Alina's the dynamics of the military are spot on, and uniforms are correct for a change.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|The same way John Hughes' movies are classics, this will eventually become one. It had drama, romance, and comedy... Classic.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|It makes it play with your own mind i mean what is your say on WICKED its weird how Dashner does it i think it makes you really think and have your own say in it
B004O0TKWG|5.0|I chose this rating because the vendor shipped it safely and it arrived to my father a few days in advance, as a Christmas gift. He was craving a good Gerry Rafferty CD and I thought this may fit. He was quite pleased with the selection of songs from both albums and he said the sound quality is great through his JBL tower speakers.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|If you like hidden object games, this is for you!  It's great on the Kindle Fire.  I am enjoying it a lot.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Father time has not diminished Clint Eastwood's ability to put forth another truly memorable performance. Mr. Eastwood's portrayal of a major league baseball scout hounded by upstart executives and a troubled relationship with a family member, while having his judgement questioned because of his age, was masterful.  If you're a true Clint Eastwood fan, spanning the years from Rowdie Hayes in Rawhide, to Dirty Harry movies you are sure to love his latest acting masterpiece.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|It wasn't as good as I expected. I have other CD's from her that the music quality is so much better!
B002413TY2|5.0|The third movie is a charm.  In this movie fans of Jason Statham, and action movies in general, get it all.  Lot's of action, a believable story-line, and a look at the softer, gentler side of the normally private, distant and unemotional Jason Statham character.  Usually, Hollywood manages to make a real mess of a first good movie by trying to recapture it in additional sequels; not this time!  This movie is just as good, and better in some ways than the original in the series...you won't be disappointed.
030758836X|2.0|Too much terrible swearing and not enough plot- more like a &#34;soap opera&#34;. I didn't enjoy neither the wife's or husbands views because they both were too selfish and demanding ( plus extensive swearing ).
0307474259|5.0|This is the first book I read that made sense when it comes to what we should all be eating to easily drop weight and feel better, along with science to back it up and disprove myths about weight loss.  And I easily lost 30lbs with only following the guidelines in the book over a 3 month period.  Also, from reading Mark Sisson's &#34;Primal Blueprint&#34;, another excellent read.  I tried juicing after seeing Fat sick and nearly dead and only lost a few pounds (probably due to adding too much fruit to help the taste buds, every drop of sugar counts!).  It would have taken less time if I didn't have my carb binging moments as well.  Cutting your dependence on carbs and becoming a fat burner instead of a carb burner is not easy because carbs and sugar are addicting.  But once you do, in my experience after a couple of weeks of very low carb (under 30/day) I didn't have the carb/sugar cravings anymore.  It took me more that one try to get to hit that 2 week mark (for me anyway, everyone is different), because carbs are very addictive.  If they weren't it would be easy for all of us to quit.  I followed that book up with &#34;Good Calories, Bad Calories&#34; by Gary Taubes (Why we get fat...is a much easier read by the way, Good Cal Bad Cal goes very in depth with the science if you are into that.),  then &#34;Primal Body, Primal Mind&#34; by Nora Gedgaudas, and am currently reading &#34;The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance&#34;.  These books have changed my life for the better! I am almost 40 and wish I knew this info earlier in life.  I haven't felt this good in almost 20 years!
B0015AARJI|5.0|the fact that this is the original controller and it is cheaper than the same original one at the store is why i bought it from you. i would buy another one as long as it is the same original one for sony playstation just like this one. it also works perfectly like it should. would not hesitate to purchase another if i need a new one. thanks
B009329Y30|4.0|Zach Efron is great. The story line is just okay to me. It wasn't terrible though. I loved Zach Efron in it, he's the reason to watch it!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Enjoyed the action. It followed the series and add a new element. Can't wait for the next one. Worth it.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|I have wanted to see this from the moment I saw the first preview. It was as amazing as I expected. The story will touch your heart and you will see so many similarities between the behavior of the chimps and our own human behavior. Great to watch with kids as the violence of their lives is censored for the most part.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazingly easy to read and very relatable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a well written story and characters who anyone can relate to.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I should have believed the reviews.  App did not want to load.  Then I can not load any city other than LA.  Not even worth, free.
B00009R86L|5.0|My wife has been complaining about her purses digging into her shoulders.  I showed her two different pads on Amazon and we decided to order this one and the Timbuk2 griptex messenger bag strap.  The Domke pad has the most padding and fit just fine on one of her purses.  She likes it a lot.  The Timbuk 2 fit on a different bag so we kept that one also.  The padding itself is an offwhite color but she doesnt mind that since her shoulder is not in pain.  It would have looked a little nicer if the padding were black.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|61 Hours was the first book I read in this series.  I needed something to read on my<br />meal break and this was the only one of the series available at the time.  It got me<br />hooked, so here I am starting from the beginning, and still have a hard time putting<br />it down.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This is one of my favorite crime shows out there.  I am addicted.  We are waiting for the next season to come out and we will undoubtedly spend a couple of nights and watch them all.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Great product v e r y h a p p y w I t h s e l l e r.
B000QE1U9K|4.0|While this is not my favorite of the Alien movies, it is not bad.  Good action, good monster.  Will always be one of my favorite series.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I absolutely loooooove this book and movie. So much fun, love, and a great plot. The relationship between the women is incredible and so heartwarming. Must read and must watch.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|this is the best weather app out there it tells you everything and it has beautiful backgrounds very well worth the money
B009WO7NQO|5.0|While the screens are not all that difficult, this version does provide a lot of entertainment.  I would recommend its purchase.
0446554995|4.0|If you have enjoyed reading the previous novels in the Pendergast series, then you will like this one. Two Graves is the third in the Helen sub-series, and you should have already read the first two, Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance, before reading this. There are enough plot twists, sub-plots, and inter-twined characters to keep a Pendergast fan entertained or maybe confused at times. It may just be me, but I had a hard time keeping everything straight. I figured it all out in the end, but sometimes these Pendergast novels nearly make my brain ache.<br />I give this book 3 1/2 stars out of 5. The story was good, but I may just be a little over Pendergast.<br />I received this e-book for free from NetGalley.
B00447G29S|3.0|Its about what I thought it would be.  I like the movie but the 3D is not the best.  It was worth the price though it was the cheepest 3d I have found.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Gran Torino was a great movie!  It is deep and you see more everytime you watch it.  The instat video is so easy to use.  It beats video stores or red box.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I could not put this down for a couple of hours. Had to force myself even then. Graphics are great and the theme is really creepy.
0316227706|5.0|Bought this for my 7 year old, as she loves dogs more than anything. She was so excited when she opened it and often calls on us to share her favorites. When my 22 year-old nephew picked it up, he thought it was awesome. He couldn't put it down. This is truly a book for everyone.
B008Y73940|5.0|Matthew and a great story - does not disappoint!  Definitely worth watching.  Appropriate for younger teens who can handle a little language and a suggestive sexual scene.
B0009W5JS2|5.0|This DVD was very good.  The product came quickly for Christmas.  I would buy another product from this business.  I recommend this product to others.
0756686970|5.0|This turned out to be something my child had wanted very much, and it more than fulfilled his desires. He was especially thrilled with the Han Solo minifig that comes with the book. Highly recommended for the Lego Star Wars addicts.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  It is more for girls than boys.  I recommend this movie for others to have.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This item is not the quality you want.  States that it will stand but is not strong enough.  Would not recommend
0689815816|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It has rhyming in it.  It also repeats alot so that the children can say the words with you.  This is a good book to have as a teacher.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I find this book hard to put down. It is a really good love story. I can't wait to finish book three
B00003CXZ1|5.0|It was an excellent movie.  I would recommend it to others.  There was alot of action in it.  I like action movies.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is a thoroughly absorbing read. I simply couldn't put it down.<br />It reminded me a lot of some good old Heinlein Especially \\"A hole in the sky\\" and \\"Farmer in the sky\\". But up to date and without the \\"Boys own adventure\\" feel.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|This is a great movie.  We love the actors in the movie.  We have all 5 movies.  I would recommend this to others.
0761119752|5.0|This author is great.  her books are feel good stories that my youngest 2 to oldest 7 love.  THis book was fun to compare all the different jammies!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|It was an excellent movie.  We have all of them.  I would recommend this movie to others.  It is an amazing movie.
034580404X|3.0|The writer is a hack.  Her main thrust is &#34;Ohhhh Christian, My poor, misunderstood man-child sadist lover&#34;!  Although it was on the best seller list for ages, I wouldn't recommend it altho I will be happy to lend the Trilogy to anyone who wants to read it!
B004EPZ00C|5.0|It was an excellent movie.  I really rejoy the guy who plays Johnny English.  I would recommend it to others.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Saw the movie in the theater.  Want to see it again and don't want to pay for popcorn!  Waiting to receive the DVD.  It was exciting, amusing, scarey, factual (?), enjoyable.
0670451495|5.0|This is a good book to have as a teacher.  It can help with math for children.  It is an old book but very cute.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I like the gaame but when you think you re getting a free game and only can play 2 levels i think its misleading.....so I love the game but not the so called &#34;FREE&#34; part
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love supernatural plots and while I've never been a fan of zombies, this show is so much more than that. trust, friendship,courage, hope, love, survival etc. really make this show hard to resist!
B00519YRH2|3.0|This is an 80's classic and I still like it.  However, we were looking for something other than an animated movie to watch with our 7 and 9-year olds.  I remembered this and thought it would be great.  However, I'd forgotten some of the language (including the F-word) and a scene where the leading lady takes off her shirt (bra on) in front of Tom Hanks.  In addition, my kids didn't &#34;get&#34; the funny parts because they're too young to realize what he's doing is inappropriate (such as the funny scenes when he goes to the black-tie company party).  Maybe it'd be more appropriate for teens, but I regret watching it with my kids.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A Christmas Carol is a wonderful story that should be read by every family every Christmas! I really enjoyed reading it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Good game for the money. I really enjoyed it. The puzzles are great on the kindle. Lots of fun. Would recommend this game for all hidden object enthusiast.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|It won't go on my list of &#34;All time classics&#34;, but we really enjoyed it.  It was well worth watching.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|My husband and I love this movie.  God bless all those that serve in the military for protecting and defending the freedoms we all enjoy in this country.  God bless their families for the sacrifices they make while their loved ones are away from home.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|TuneIn Radio Pro is amazing! It has songs that I can get at my fingertips. I can even save and record for later. I am so pleased with TuneIn Radio Pro ... if you like anything from Ambient to Trance, from Dance to Oldies, from Children's - Christmas music this is the music app for you. It has tons of different sounds, and has a large radio selection from around the world. If you like to just take it down a notch to relax, it even has a sleep setting. You can record your favorites!! You can pause and play. I love it!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Scaled very well.  Started a video on my PC and watched it at work with sound and issues. Nice bonus was it automatically cut the audio at home.
0061733199|5.0|Always a handy book to have. if you go out into the wild may I recommand taking this with you.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love the timed game! Makes for fun competitions :)<br />I also like that the tiles are easier to see. Other mahjong have several similar tiles or with little differences so it gets too confusing! Love this game!
B000JMLFLW|4.0|One of those old classic. One must simply have on ones book case and have read it at least once in there life.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I got this game for my 4 yr old.  I was afraid that it would be a bit difficult but the pictures are very clear and easy to follow.  The directions are well laid out and easy to follow.  The catapult actually works very well.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this game.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Come and take a read from where it all started. It will get you to keep turing the page everytime
1401230423|5.0|I absolutely love the Sandman.  I recently started reading it again and saw that I was missing this volume so purchased it again.  It is a comic for intellectuals.  The content discussed, the historical and mythical references are intertwined so well into Gaiman's storytelling.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Sandman to anyone and everyone.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love this movie. This is a must have for any marvel fan, and I can not wait to see what they do with the second one.
