B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love love love this game!  So addictive to play!  A swing and a hit in my book!  The graphics are great and really give you an excellent feeling of motion when playing that really draws you into the game.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The minute the 3D disks arrived on March 19, 2013 they went into my Playstation 3 and I watched \\"The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey\\" in 3D.  I was not disappointed.  The movie is excellent and the 3D added to the enjoyment.  I had seen the Hobbit in the theater so there was no real surprise with the movie.  The real pleasant surprise was the video blogs that came with the film. Thank you Peter Jackson for taking the time to do the video blogs.  I stayed up way late watching all of them.  The video blogs alone make this package worth twice the price.  In the video blogs Peter Jackson (and several of the people who worked on this film) tell about making the movie.  The video blogs also show many of the sets and locations used in making the film and much much more.  If you like that kind of thing you are in for a real treat.  I am going to close this review and watch all the video blogs again.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Peter Jackson for a wonderful entertainment package.
B004132HZS|5.0|Much edgier than the new &#34;Elementary&#34; TV series (which I like) this modern update of Sherlock Holmes adventures it very satisfying as both story and intellectual exploration of an extraordinary mind.  We need more of these!
B004LROMWU|4.0|great cast, strong character driven story. This was a show I hesitated to pick up on dvd because of the alien premise, etc. The sci fi angle is interesting but the main point of humanity rising up to survive and build a new life is the driving force behind this series.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the ills of our current food industry and how we Americans are being sold unhealthy eating.  I have made a number of changes in my eating habits and my buying after reading this comprehensive work.  I strongly recommend it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|What a fast read, I couldn't put it down.  It ended to soon.  Stephen King brings the players to life.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I hope they keep making great music! I am so happy I purchased this. I have loved every song on this album!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show is well written, great special effects, and suspenseful.  Once I start watching I have a hard time stopping.  Look forward to future episodes.
B0011TMOIK|5.0|Jk Rowling has earned all of her stripes, badges, stickers etc. with this series. I honestly think she is one of the best writers and it is well told on the screen.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|A dark movie, to be expected, and a little too long.  But, still very good.  If you missed it in the theater see it now.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I became a Rush fan in 1971. As a drummer myself I can never get enouigh of Neil . Through the years I have watched Rock and Roll go the way of the dinosaurs, leaving only a few real talents. Eventually I became a Rush FREAK. Of the 500 or so songs on my Walkman over 50 are Rush.<br /><br /> This newest album was not as good, in my opinion, as  earlier ones. I have never really been carried away with the whole concept album concept (pun intended) and this album is no exception. Sometimes the songs have a strained quality to them as if they are struggling to write a song which fits the concept rather than just letting the Rock flow.<br /><br /> Rush still demonstrates tremendous virtuosity and song writing ability, but they are slowing down and becoming more technical, electronic, ...and mellow(?). I miss the force of their earlier songs, the hard-driving full-speed-ahead Rush (pun intended) of music which grabs you and takes you with it.<br /><br />This is a really good album but I guess we're all getting old, huh boys.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have now had an opportunity to listen to this album several times, and I gotta say, it really grows on you. Despite attempts to stick with the concept of the album, the songs all stand on their own merit and are unmistakably Rush. They continue to amaze as both musicians and writers. Neil is a great lyrics writer, if he does sometimes wax deep and philosophical. The arrangements are spot on. I'm not crazy about the orchestral arrangements, I don't think Rush needs them. One of the amazing things about them has always been how much music could be generated by only three men.<br /><br />That said, I will never fail to buy every new album they produce. And I will never cease to love and respect both the band and the music.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|And I’ve watched it twice one of the best movies I’ve seen in a long time. The combat tactics were on point. And the list of actors wow!!! What a true time line of events leading up to may 5th 2011 geronamo down History has a Movie and its called  ZERO DARK THIRTY

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love this game. I was hesitant  based on the number of reviews that had installation problems, but decided to get it anyhow. I am glad I did. I am enjoying the game.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|It is interesting to see the world events occurring, and the difference with which the classes view themselves, but I am getting a little tired of O'Brien and Thomas always plotting behind everyone's back and Mr. Bates' woeful tale!
B000HKYBXA|5.0|This was the best Hamlet I have ever seen. Have read the play several times but loved this adaptation the best.
B002APU580|5.0|This is my favorite adaptation of Pride and Pejudice. These actors work well with the director and create magic. Five stars!
1451695195|5.0|It's well written and most intriguing.  The author takes you on a journey with all kinds of twists and turns.  I found it to be most interesting and can highly recommend it!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|OK I am a Rankin junkie. This may not be his best book but it is still head and shoulders above the rest. Best character development in the game.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Macklemore says f*** you to the system, he does it his way. That's all that matters. If you don't like it, who cares. Someone else will
B008N1V11U|1.0|I got the batman app and I was excited to play it but. it told me that you need to delete a lot of stuff. I got very mad.because I deleted mostly everything I had but then it still told me to delete stuff.so I deleted the app. can you guys fix that.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This usually isn't my type of game, but the graphics and story are entertaining.  The tutorial really is really helpful.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|the angry birds toons are funny and all but I can't not beileve its only 2minutes long I thought that it was going to be 22minutes long.like an regular wp. can you make the next wp longer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The concept of the game is pretty simple.  The beauty is that you don't get the frustration of wasting coins at your local arcade.  I enjoyed this way more that I thought I would.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It is a matching game but it changes all the time.very interesting and challenging.I enjoy it a lot  can't imagine what else to say
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's been weeks for me to play this game on 2 tablets. It kills a lot of free time for me. I am still playing everyday up to level 19 so far.  I believe there will be more surprise for me.  I love this game. Nice graphic.  It does require a lot of graphic card memory to display well.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|my wife and I really enjoyed this movie.Ben Affleck should have received a oscar for best director!<br />Amust watch movie!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccuWeather is wonderful because you can access all of the cities your family and friends live in.<br />Also, you get up to date instant weather reports.  AccuWeather notifies you of bad weather ahead.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun little game we all enjoy!! The kids love helping take care of the horses. Great way to kill some time.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I rented this movie with low expectations to watch it on a Sunday morning while having breakfast. I though I was going to watch half of it. Well, breakfast lasted as long as the movie. Catfish is proof you don't need a Hollywood budget to make a great movie.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Good fun game for children.  They learn coordination and response time.<br />Good game to keep them busy. The children and adults like that.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|really loved the story and the visuals were enthralling. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action mixed with heart
0375836675|3.0|I bought I Am The Messenger after having read The Book Thief, also by Markus Zusak.  I enjoyed the latter enormously.  It was a poignant and strongly thematic work.  Upon finishing it, I figured I might check out what else Zusak had written, and so I logged onto Amazon, ordered this book, received it in the mail, and proceeded with what turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.  That's not to say that this is a bad book.  But it's the sort of thing that I would only really recommend for a young teenager or a preteen, whereas I have recommended The Book Thief to people of all ages.<br />In terms of story, it's not bad.  It's about a young man who is compelled to help others, often in non-obvious ways, or ways that put him in serious danger, by a mysterious unseen messenger.  But in terms of food for thought and emotional impact it doesn't quite satisfy like The Book Thief.  Having said that, I am completely aware that I am comparing it far too much to Zusak's other work.  However, I feel that many others who have read The Book Thief may be interested in reading I Am The Messenger, and all I want to do is to warn them that the two books are nothing alike in terms of both content and quality.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I downloaded this for my wife and she can't stop playing it. She had the original angry birds and completed it, this one is a little more challenging and she loves it.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|I like all Nelson DeMille's books, so when a new one is released I read it. I liked this book because is relevant, thrilling, so it is a fast read. I got a little tired of John Corey's mostly witty but some inane witticisms but one can't help but like him for being the loyal American he is.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|It was one of my first downloads...I didn't realize it was a shallow romance novel. If I knew anyone who liked romance novels I'd probably recommend it.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|The book was well written. In writing from the dog's perspective, we get a sense of who we are and why we are here.
0345525558|3.0|This is a very interesting idea for a story, but the plot grows old fast.  Particularly enjoyed learning the meanings and descriptions of plants and flowers. Just needed more action to move the story along.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I just bought it few days ago. It arrived earlier than expected, and one other thing is that i am buying from Philippines. Could you imagine how cool is that? I don't really know what to say. :) This interface is one of the good quality interface in its level. I love Amazon, Focusrite, and DHL. :)
030758836X|2.0|I read somewhere that the book \\"punches you in the gut\\" at the end......how? I thought the ending was terrible. The book never really ended. It builds you up to think she will die - maybe not the way you think, but some how. But then it ends with questions still lingering and you wondering how their life will remain from that point on.  I HATED the way it was written. The author gives soo many random details. Or random thoughts from a character about an event that happened a long time - it will have nothing to do with the story and make you feel like you just wasted your time reading 2 pages about it. I did enjoy how it switch between his view and her view, however I wish the booked started with hers, and then went to his. I kept fogetting what the last thing he said was by the time I finished a chapter about her diary. The foul language was a bit much too. I'm no prude, but it didn't help the book any by making dirty comments from time to time. An author should be able to get their point across by using other words.<br /><br />Overall I thought the book was ok. If you get to read it for free, then do it. But I would never buy the book because I have no interest in reading it again.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|Frank Baum's Oz series has always been fertile ground for toys, comics, and books seeking to put their own spin on the public domain property.  But ever since \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" the movie industry just hasn't managed to replicate the iconic film's success, and with good reason: \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" now defines the books, even if it wasn't a faithful adaptation.  The yellow brick road is littered with failures: \\"Return to Oz,\\" \\"The Wiz,\\" and \\"Tin Man.\\" It took a powerhouse like Disney to finally break the curse.<br /><br />The first big challenge to the film's success is James Franco as Oscar Diggs (AKA the magician known as Great Oz). Franco has something of an intellectual distance to him tinged with arrogance that makes him vaguely irritating - but it works here, because that's exactly how Oz is supposed to be.  He's a lady's man who preys on willfully ignorant women, luring them into his wiles with manufactured tales of woe that lands him in hot water, a tornado, and ultimately Oz.<br /><br />In no time Oz encounters the wide-eyed Theodora (Mila Kunis) who plays the witch as a kind of mentally-addled dreamer wistfully projecting her hopes and dreams on the handsome stranger. He's prophesized to be the savior of Oz, a powerful wizard who will reclaim the Emerald City.  It's not that easy of course; it seems the steward of Emerald City is Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and she's rightly skeptical of this new wizard who can't cast a single spell.  With the Emerald City's riches egging him on, Oz is put on a quest to steal the wicked witch's wand.  It's basically the plot of \\"Army of Darkness,\\" with less skeletons and more monkeys.<br /><br />Along the way, Oz will assemble his own motley crew of allies: flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff) and China Girl (Joey King), a living china doll.  The special effects excel in bringing these two characters to life, such that it's difficult not to stare at China Girl - a living doll that is expertly brought to life but fails to convincingly interact with any of the living characters.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the plot centers on Oz being such an unlikeable cad that he turns women into witches, there's lots of things \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" gets right. For one, the script is tight - the lost art of foreshadowing is in full force here, and the movie neatly ties back to events that happen early in the film.  For another, it expertly weaves in callouts to \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" There's nothing more or less to \\"Oz\\" than what's in the later film, but it still manages to seem fresh. From the framing, to the color transitions, to the soaring score by Danny Elfman, \\"Oz\\" never forgets its roots.  It's a big movie with a capital \\"B.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oz\\" is far from perfect.  It's a little off, a little too grand, a little too smarmy at times.  But that's a description that could easily be applied to the Land of Oz.  And in that regard Sam Raimi has pulled off something great and powerful.ails to convincingly interact with any of the living characters.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the plot centers on Oz being such an unlikeable cad that he turns women into witches, there's lots of things \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" gets right.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|I was sad as it ended and thought it was a better second than many other authors could write. they did a very good job on the book.
B005USZML4|4.0|This is a &#34;youth book&#34; but I am such a John Grisham fan that I read and enjoyed it anyway.  I really like Mr. Grisham's writing style.
B002NZK5RI|5.0|Super fast shipping - no issues with product at all.  I tend to be nervous about ordering movies for fear that there will be something wrong with the item.
1451695195|1.0|I read this book because it was my book club's monthly selection.  I am not predisposed to reading about Near Death Experiences.  I do believe that God exists and that the Bible is His word to us, and I believe that all we need to know about Heaven, this side of it, is written there.<br /><br />This author's view of heaven is that of a New Age persuasion, not a biblical one.  I read it on my Kindle and was able to do a search of how many times he uses each of the following words:<br />Jesus = 3<br />Christ = 0<br />Bible = 0<br /><br />He does, however, insist on calling God \\"Om\\" because that is the sound he heard during his NDE.  I'm not discounting that he might have actually experienced something spiritual while in his coma, but I do not believe that what he experienced was from or about God.  I believe he was deceived by whatever entity might have been influencing his mind and spirit during that coma.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a Christian, as you will most likely be sorely disappointed by it.  A much better book, done by thoroughly searching the Scriptures, is Randy Alcorn's Heaven.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|One of the best films I've seen in recent memory. A memorable, compelling story with richly developed characters. One of those films that's difficult to condense into a soundbite but is truly outstanding. If only all movies were this good. Enjoy!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and enough functions to let me do day to day stuff and help my godson with his homework...and big enough to see with or without my glasses.

B0083Z614S|5.0|Enjoyable light and amusing but not overly sappy.  Wide range of personalities.  Most important, a happy ending.  Makes you want to build your own secret garden.
6305313687|5.0|This is a very real story.  It makes you think hard about things.  It's got great acting by some great actors.  I think everyone should see this movie.  It brings a very real story together about stuff still going on today.

B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old loves this movie! It keeps her entertained and now she wants to be Dracula for Halloween!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Well written and well acted show.  Some character development over the seasons, particularly for the main character, Alicia, and her family.  Fast moving plots.<br /><br />However, it sometimes leaves a bad taste in my mouth as the show often demonstrates how -- if you have enough money to spend on lawyers and their investigators -- you can generally sway a decision in your direction, often by tripping up the prosecution on some minor procedural point.<br /><br />The fact that the law firm represents a known drug dealer ('but only in his legitimate businesses&#34;) doesn't say much about the ethics of the law partners.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you laugh and cry at the same time.  Beautiful visuals of nature that will awe you.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Funny movie, but more importantly, my 4 and 2 year old kids enjoyed immensely. Kept them interested the whole movie. Several showings,too
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV shows. Although it's a murder mystery, it's also about relationships between family and friends.  Great chemistry amoung the main characters.  I was glad to find it available on Amazon.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Best new take on Sherlock Holmes I have seen to date. Sharp, witty and a bit hard edged. I've read (and mostly re-read) all the Holmes stories and seen all of (and own most of) the television series with Jeremy Brett as Sherlock and this is the best television series on a &#34;modern&#34; Sherlock Holmes so far. Not to say some of the others weren't good, just not as good as I've found this one to be. That it now takes place in New York didn't effect it as I had feared it would and I'm enjoying the British/American, Male/Female interaction introduced. I hope it gets sufficient ratings to hang around for a few years and that the writers are able to continue with the really interesting stories.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|The ending was a total surprise it made me go hummm!  I loved it, A really good read.....and a mystery..
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I had a lot of fun with this in the beginning. You start off with enough cash to go nuts and get your park jumping. However, an hour or two in, you get &#34;dollar bill&#34; hungry. You can earn these over time, or you can buy them for real money. Without them, the pace of the game grinds to a halt and becomes a waiting game.<br /><br />So while you CAN play without spending money, it gets boring pretty quickly.

B00A8KJK7G|3.0|Frankenweenie is a good movie yet it pales in comparison to ParaNorman. The reason I bring this film up for contrast is because both have similar styles, produced in the same manner (stop motion photography) and even share spooky sensibilities. However, whereas ParaNorman takes chances, Frankenweenie plays it safe and stops cold in time to give everyone a flattering happy ending.<br /><br />Instead of learning one of the hardest lessons in life (conquering one's pain by letting go) vicariously through the eyes of Victor, the audience is lobotomized into a flattering happy ending where the main character (Victor) fails to have learned anything through the mayhem caused through bringing his beloved pet back to life. It's a missed opportunity but perhaps one the filmmakers did not care for examining.<br /><br />Of course, I'm coming at this from the point of view from an adult man finding it disheartening the filmmakers borrowed the theme of the Frankenstein account (a story that examines whether the soul of a man is only skin deep & whether a man, through disadvantage of the parts he is made of, is inherently evil or has the capacity for goodness) and ignored the big payoff at the end. I'm not saying \\"Hey boys, get yer shotguns and go all Ole Yeller on that Frankenweenie!\\" but I do happen to think kids are tougher and can handle something without dumbing it down.<br /><br />The animation, sets, character design were all beautiful and in keeping with Tim Burton's style. Music by Danny Elfman, Burton's long time contributor, appropriately sets the mood and does not delineate. I think the fact Elfman & Burton have been working so long together has only made them stronger yet Elfman is capable of standing alone, robust enough to score films of different genres.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you have kids like I do, Frankenweenie will delight and amuse, and quite frankly it's a much better option to the senseless shooting of something like Transformers or some random cartoonshow. I wouldn't turn your evening into an entire after school special about life & death after watching the movie, but it could be a good opportunity to discuss these themes nonchalantly. No, this movie won't prepare your kid for Rover/Fluffy's untimely death, but we can't hold Hollywood entirely responsible for doing so. Having said that, to the filmmakers/studios, I know you're running a business but let's make our kids lions, not sheep. I'm bringing Bambi back. :-P

B00BETX5PS|4.0|In general it was good Bond.  The ending was off the chart unreal.  Too many dead bodies lying around.  The villain kills anything that moves but lets the old man live.  After Bond does everything short of walking on water, he still fails in protecting &#34;M&#34;.  Moneypenny was a pleasant surprise. It was refreshing to see Bond as a human being, not just a cartoon character.<br /><br />It was nice to see Bond with a minimal of gadgets, however, the special effects people were too over the top.  The pyrotechnics were overdone and the ease with which the bad guys simply walk up and gun down security at Parliament, walk into a hearing and blow away the good guys was too much!  I know this is Bond, but I lost track of the body count.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate &#34;Skyfall&#34; in the top 5 Bonds but not the best.
030758836X|2.0|I'm not one to write reviews, but on this book, I had to. I'm amazed at how much positive press it has received, I found it twisted, far-fetched and disturbing. The characters are unlikable and self-centered. I kept reading because everyone says it gets to the point where you can't put it down, which is somewhat true. It gets so twisted that you can't help but wonder how the author is going to wrap it all up and tie all the loose ends together, which she does poorly. It is NOT a great story, nor is it well-written. The book ends and you're left with a bad taste in your mouth. I wish I never read it!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Good action flick.  I lived through this event time frame and remember well the goofy inaction of our President Carter.  This event should NEVER have happen, but it did and this was good old &#34;gutsy&#34; spook work.  Carter said we didn't need Human Intelligence.  DUH!  Attention to detail, ie. the kids piecing together the shredded documents, was right on. Who cares that they embellished parts of the story to make a better movie.<br /><br />Great job Ben!

B00B671W6W|3.0|Not bad, but it just doesn't sound like Anthrax.  Now, I grew up with Anthrax, NOT these particular bands that they're covering.  With that in mind, I guess I just want more ORIGINAL Anthrax material.  My biggest complaint, though, is it's just like 6 covers.  I don't understand why it couldn't have been longer.  Also, the reason I like Anthrax is because it's NOT classic rock.  So, yeah, this E.P. is kind of pointless to me.  HOWEVER, it DOES sound good, and Joey's the vocalist.  So that's a plus.<br /><br />This isn't bad, don't get me wrong.  But I'd rather have a new ALBUM...not an E.P. of classic rock tunes.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I really don't know why so many people said it was the best picture ever.  really?  I think Ang Lee is an awesome film maker.  I even think that he made an awsome film here too.  Production wise, and even telling a story.  I really don't get the profound impact it was supposed to have on me and how it was gonna show me about God.  That's why I gave it a &#34;just ok&#34;.

1451683405|2.0|Same old, same old ...  This writer clearly doesn't understand the philosophical issue, and he simply repeats his previous arguments. His factual case rests on Libet's experiments which have been shown to miss the mark. There is much in the current neuroscience literature that demonstrates free will but Harris doesn't seem to know the literature in his own field.
0765325950|4.0|I have enjoyed this series since the beginning. Yes I know the middle books dragged, but the end was fixed by Mr. Sanderson and the books finished at their potential. The only problem I saw was that end book had too much of a war story to get through. I read it, I liked it, but the more I was away from the book the more I saw problems and the more I disliked how the end of the war was handled. I truly wished for more of an ending than I got, but I did like how some characters ended their patterns. I felt like this book was like white chocolate, good at first then later when the aftertaste hits you it overwhelms you making you dislike it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It took me awhile to get into this book because most of the main characters are introduced pretty much one right after the other in the first pages.  So it took me a bit of time to figure out who was who.  Once I got into it, however, I began comparing it to the classic, &#34;Our Town,&#34;  which I'm sure most of us baby boomers were required to read somewhere along our educational way.  And, I must say, I enjoyed this one much more than I ever liked &#34;Our Town.&#34;  It's actually a dark story, about all the nasty little undercurrents of life that no one outside the family home knows about.  People on the outside think the family is perfect, but just wait....  I also thought the second major theme of the book, who's going to throw a hat into the political ring for a vacated city council seat, is probably so close to the truth of how that really happens than most of us would like to admit.  There were times through the book that I thought, is there no one in this town even remotely happy?  But then I realized this is how life really is, the ugly and the less ugly.  The third theme of 'us vs. them, the haves vs. the have nots, probably plays out in real life very much like it does in the novel.  When I got to the end, I was at first disappointed, but the longer I thought about it, the more I realized the book ended the only way it could have.  Life goes on....
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Video and audio quality is outstanding. Like other reviewers it was interesting to see Joe Walsh sitting serenely on a stool playing and singing.  The Eagles are the best of the modern era, what I call anything past the 70's.  Highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great music played and sung by great musicians.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The plot is totally believable. Excellent screen play and well acted. Excellent job by Denzel Washington. Exciting from start to finish.
B005IS56CG|4.0|I ordered this and just love the extra bonus disc that came with it!  For the price I paid it was well worth it!

1451695195|1.0|I didn't get far into this book.  I've read enough 'credible' accounts to recognize a fraud when I see one.  This account does not line up with scripture in any way whatsoever, which to me says that Satan is once again doing his best to imitate God...and not doing it well.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have had one since they first came out years ago. This picks up hair, dirt, and debris very well from smooth floors. This is not a vacuum and not really made for carpets. I do use it on the carpet in my kitchen that has very low knap and it works great.<br /><br />I was disappointed that this didn't have the one touch empty tray. In order to empty you have to push the tabs on top to get the tray to release and then empty it yourself. This little inconvenience is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />Also, in order to extend battery life, when not using the sweeper take the battery out or it will drain it very quickly.<br />Mostly I am very pleased, it's nicer to pull this out of the closet than lug out the big vacuum.

B00APUYN0I|4.0|this is one of those movies you won't see unless someone recommends it that you trust.  If you like acappella (or just singing in general) you'll love the movie.  Forget about the plot, the singing is great and is really the star of the movie.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the books, and like all great stories, the book is best. But for someone who doesn't want or doesn't have time to read the book, the movie is an excellent substitute.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed the first season very much and since have started the second season.  When you find a jewel like this from the past it gives you the opportunity to enjoy all of the hard work put into the development of a show of this type.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The visual landscaping is breathtaking and so is the plot. I have stopped watching the standard cable channels because I am so sick of reality shows and how we have elevated mediocrity people to celebrities. The story line is brutally honest with respect to crimes against women, children and even scared people of God. But it is a true glimpse of portion of a cultural heritage. I for one will not miss an episode.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I haven't read the other reviews, but based on word of mouth, I can't possibly have anything more to say.  Like everyone else I laughed so hard I cried, peed a little, embarrassed myself in public waiting rooms and despite all that I probably didn't do this book justice. I should probably read it again and try to laugh harder without hurting myself.  Well done Tina Fey!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Loved all the intelligence gathering leading up to the trike.  Great actors and action scenes.  Could have been a little shorter.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|I was enthralled from the very first frame! The actors performances were amazing and the writing was brilliant. This movie was on my mind for several days after and I've been recommending it to all my friends.

It's a unique twist on a love story, where things don't always end the way you imagined or had hoped.  It has an awesome soundtrack too  :)  Just love Zooey D and Joseph Gordon-Levitt!

1939416019|2.0|The writing is very simplistic. If you are looking for a something with any depth this is not for you. The plot is very basic and cliche. This does not mean the plot is bad. Rather, because similar plots have been done before and this version is simplistic, a higher level of writing is expected, but not delivered. The main character suddenly attains powers right in the nick of time but then losses them mysteriously and no longer has them. The imagery used is kind of repetitious. The romance is a middle school perception of what love and romance entails. There are some inconsistencies in many of the actions scenes. What annoys me most though is the lack of effort required on the part of characters to attain skill/power or achieve a goal. No detail of grueling work and effort in order to become a warrior or wizard/sorcerer. In a single lesson the hero can progress leaps and bounds beyond everyone else. Yes we want the hero to be best but a better/accurate portrayal of the acquisition of mastery in an art, whether it is magic or fighting, is part of the journey. Overall the plot has some potential with some rewriting and editing. If the author would take the time to go through the process of rewriting and editing this plot could be better portrayed.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I recently got married, and well, I missed having Disney movies in my house!<br />I picked this one up at the store.  I love having the bonus features!!!

I love Disney songs, I love Disney movies, I love Disney!<br />This is definitely a classic, that goes without saying.  And it's great to watch with my hubby, or our nieces/nephew.  I can't wait until we have our own children and I can share this childhood favorite with them!

B00AYPXG5W|3.0|A classic alien abduction tale based on a true story.  I could watch this fascinating movie over and over again.  Certainly leaves you thinking.
B005IQZB14|4.0|As you can tell, I wasn't entirely smitten with this book.  In fact, I was really irritated and put it down for awhile.  The first hundred pages read like a tawdry soap opera with the main character indulging herself in overblown emotional outpourings that are painful to read.  And they're endless.  She continues to whine and moan about her pitiful life until you just can't take it.  At the point, I put the book down.<br /><br />However, when I picked it up again, she finished, for a moment or two, her self-indulgent, obsessive self-flaggelation and tried to focus on the challenge of the Pacific Crest Trail.  But she was horribly unaware of the grim reality of backpacking long distances with no preparation.  And that's when it got interesting.<br /><br />She was brutally honest about how ill-prepared she was.  As a result, her book reads as a cautionary tale...what not to do when you're backpacking great distances!  And I came to admire the fact that she persevered, despite wearing too-small boots that wrecked her feet and kept her in an endless state of agony.  That might have been the key to her evolution as a real human being:  she had real pain to think of instead of obsessively analyzing, reviewing, and reliving the past.

B002DOSBMK|5.0|E-books have made available a plethora of poorly written or edited books so I approached this one hesitantly given the author's prodigious output of series and books.  After reading this first book I ordered all the remaining books in the series.  Almost through with the third one and the writing and storytelling remains excellent.  My favorite author has always been Jack Vance for his incredible ability to create amazingly detailed cultures and societies.  Salvatore follows in the footsteps of Vance with the telling of the Drizzt saga.  I am very much looking forward to completing the series.

Now that I am at my own home I use my own alarm clock but I would recommend this product for anytime an alarm clock is needed and it gives you the weather too.

1451627297|5.0|11/22/63, written by Stephen King, is a look back to what might have happened if John F. Kennedy had not been assassinated. This thick tome was written from the viewpoint of Jake Epping, a 40-something man from 2011, who gets a chance to visit the past and change history. Epping finds a \\"rabbit hole\\" that takes him to the day of September 9, 1958, in Lisbon Falls, Maine. Epping goes on this quest a few times, first exploring and then actively changing events, trying to help certain people he has encountered on his trips to the past. Each time he goes back, he starts from the same day again, and if he wants to accomplish the same things as previously, he has to repeat them. Only he usually tries to improve what he has done before.<br /><br />I have not read a King novel in a long time and wanted to find out if I still enjoyed his writing. Less a fan of horror, I thought this story was just right in mixing the unbelievable with history. Characters such as Lee Oswald and his wife, Marina, came to to life on the page. Some other historical figures that I have forgotten about or really never have been familiar with are present. Don't worry, Oswald is the bizarre character he has always been. Since there is a 5-year time period before the event, I enjoyed the glimpse back at the world of the late 50s/early 60s, when life was simpler without the constant barrage of electronics of all sorts. However, I would not want to go back myself to those times of racism, sexism, and geographical isolation for most.<br /><br />King obviously did huge amounts of research to get the story and characters just right and needs to be commended. Epping, a high school teacher in 2011, finds a job in a small town south of Dallas/Ft. Worth, while visiting the two cities numerous times to put his plan in motion. He also falls in love. The small town dynamics are so fun to read about, especially if you have experienced them for yourself. Of course, I enjoyed his travels on some of my most well-known Dallas stomping grounds. Greenville Avenue, for example, is certainly a very different place today, and is still constantly changing.<br /><br />The greater part of the first section of the book was spent resolving a couple of murders  that Epping became emotionally caught up in while he is still in the northeast. King's setting of Derry, Maine, very familiar to most followers of his fiction, plays a big role in this book.<br /><br />I can only highly recommend 11/22/63. Every few years, I like to visit The Sixth Floor Museum and I never fail to appreciate the hard work of the curators and the relics and displays they choose to present. I avoided going to this museum for a very long time until I was forced to take some clients there years ago. (Going to The Sixth Floor is so much better than having to cart people to Southfork Ranch.)<br /><br />There are only two events that usually give me the shivers if I start reading about them: the Manson murders and the JFK assassination. And who to address the latter better than Stephen King?wn Dallas stomping grounds.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My son read all the books and kept trying to get me to read them. After watching the movie, (and him saying &#34;the book is 10x's better) I decided to give it a try.  Although the ending was not the greatest without the &#34;happily ever after&#34; it was a more of a reality, good things happen , but so do the bad.<br /> I think I put off reading it as it was labeled &#34;young adult&#34;. I am sad that was the reason, and hope this doesn't hinder anyone else. After all, we are young at heart!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|So I sat down to watch this with my kids and I think I had more fun with it then they did! Being a kid from the eighties I couldn't help but gush over all the old arcade game references. Now for my kids who didn't know what the heck dad was going on about the great animation and wonderful story were enough to keep them glued to the set as well.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The director is brilliant!<br />My girlfriend and myself watch it on her kindle and we watch a tleast 3 episodes a week

B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I tried it out online but when I downloaded it to my Kindle it was not the same.  &#34;Help&#34; was no help.  No real discription of what it can do.  Sorry I can't return it.  I'll certainly think more than twice about downloading vague apps next time.

B008H08XW2|5.0|I am not usually one to love every song on a CD, actually I rarely do.  I put this one in my cars CD player on my way to work and I was rocking out.  I totally love it.  I even waited in the parking lot for a few songs to finish before going in to work.  I have already listened to it about 10 times and I still really love it.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Before I watched it, I thought ZERO DARK THIRTY would basically be a spiritual sequel to Bigelow's prior film, THE HURT LOCKER.  While LOCKER is a great film in many ways, it remains rather tedious and full of itself.  ZERO doesn't quite escape these shackles--it is an \\"important movie,\\" after all--but it definitely ratchets up the suspense.  That's not to say it's a thriller; it's a procedural, rooted firmly in dirty politics and questionable morality.  The film basically follows one character's decade-long hunt for Bin Laden...scratch that: it follows her decade-long hunt for Bin Laden's courier.  So, you know, this isn't a Stallone film.<br /><br />But the movie manages to maintain a healthy pace.  This is thanks in large part to Jessica Chastain's performance; at times restrained, other moments over-the-top, she is the center of the film here, as the supporting cast (featuring great turns from Mark Strong, Joel Edgerton,  Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, James Gandolfini, and others) rotates in and out.  Mark Boal's script doesn't judge, condone, or condemn; many have viewed this movie as \\"pro-torture,\\" but really, the film just puts it blatantly there: torture was used.  If the script has any major faults, it's that it's more focused on the procedural aspect; at times, we get a sense of how this obsession is affecting Chastain's character...but then we get right back to the case at hand.<br /><br />Bigelow's directing is solid and nuanced; I thought THE HURT LOCKER lacked any real personal touch from her, but we definitely feel it here, going from the intense opening torture sequences, through the bump and grind of office work, to the edge-of-your-seat raid at the finale (conducted in almost pitch darkness).  The film is ultimately a bit of a showoff, but it's hard to hold that against it.  Perhaps ZERO DARK THIRTY isn't the end-all be-all film that many critics hailed it as (Bigelow is one of those directors who seems to evoke the highest--and lowest--praise, with any middle ground usually passed over), but it's certainly a fine film, well-constructed and entertaining despite its at-times mundane subject matter.t--praise, with any middle ground usually passed over), but it's certainly a fine film, well-constructed and entertaining despite its at-times mundane subject matter.

They always showed up people could go through horrible things and still come out on the other side.<br /><br />If you have read and liked Wintergirls, Speak or Cut then you will like this book. If you need a good cry, this is a fast read that is definitely going to make you cry.<br /><br />I could read this over and over again, Loved it!

B0017O1MIM|5.0|This product is one of the best Movies out there, along with the Ten Commandments 6-Disc Combo set, and Bond 50 (22 Disc set).  I normally don't do reviews but all I can say is that this movie in Blu-ray is amazing, awesome and excellent.  Picture and Sound quality is exceptional. Every collector should have this set in their collection.  The Book is great and to have a copy of the film is also a plus.  I am well satisfied with this set.  I not only received it before time from seller, but package was wrapped good and received without damage.  Would buy from this seller again.  Get this set and enjoy it.

B00BCZU8WM|4.0|After a lengthy seven year hiatus, Justin Timberlake finally returns to the music scene with 2013's highly anticipated [[ASIN:B00BCZU8WM The 20/20 Experience]].  Timberlake continues his collaboration with goto producer Timbaland as well as working with Jerome \\"J-Roc\\" Harmon. The effort can be described as scattered, given the fact that Timberlake restlessly shifts between different styles (pop, soul, contemporary R&B, dance, etc).  While there is less cohesion aside for the thematic focus of love, it is quite an alluring set. Vocally, Timberlake always sounds impressive, handling vocal arrangements and vocal production himself.<br /><br />\\"Pusher Lover Girl\\" opens The 20/20 Experience is a pop-soul vein.  Timberlake likens his lady to a pusher man asking her on the chorus \\"...So go on and be my dealer baby...cause all I want is you baby...\\" Delivering a commanding falsetto, Timberlake sounds magnificent as to be expected.  Unlike previous openers (\\"Se&ntilde;orita\\" or \\"Futuresex/LoveSound\\"),  it is a bit surprising Timberlake didn't opt for a peppier opener. The familiar promo single \\"Suit & Tie\\" gives The 20/20 Experience begins in chopped-n-screwed fashion, with Timberlake singing \\"I be on my suit and tie... let me show you a few things.\\" The sound is sunny with Timberlake playing up his signature schmaltz with a swagger. Jay-Z guests, but ultimate seems unnecessary, even months since the single dropped.<br /><br />\\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" is anchored by percussive, tribal-sounding beat and a repetitive Timbaland hook (\\"Dance, don't hold the wall...\\"). During the obligatory breakdown section (a trend from 2006's [[ASIN:B000H305U0 FutureSex / LoveSounds]]), the cut transforms and the beat trends more dance-pop/urban. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\", a better cut than \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\", clocks in at eight minutes.  The sound is describable as synthesized (electronic) and sort of low-key.  Timberlake continues to shout out to love/attraction: \\"...Hey hey hey, smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum / you really got me good when you said / hey hey hey, popping that Strawberry bubblegum / this goes out to you, this goes out to you...\\" By the latter portion of the cut, the style is locked into 80s R&B/pop.<br /><br />\\"Tunnel Vision\\" goes hard - percussively speaking.  Though the beat is edgy,  Timberlake softens when it comes to the message: \\"I got that tunnel vision for you...I only see you...\\" Timberlake delivers a solid vocal performance as well as one of effort's best cuts.  He goes for the slow jam on \\"Spaceship Coupe\\", the epitomization of contemporary R&B buttressed by devastating drums only Timbaland could do.  Justin and the Tennessee Kids take the reins on \\"That Girl\\", a cut that switches gears to neo-soul.  Here, Timberlake confirms his love, despite the judgements from others: \\"Cause I'm in love with that girl / so don't be mad at me...so what if you're from the other side of the tracks, so what if the world don't think we match...I'm in love with that girl / and she told me, she's in love with me...\\"<br /><br />Timberlake electrifies on  \\"Let The Groove Get In\\", a mix of Latin, pop, and dance.  \\"Let The Groove Get In\\" would seem the perfect opener as opposed to \\"Pusher Lover Girl\\".  The hook is catchy (\\"Are you comfortable right there, right there? Let the groove get in there, right there\\") and the groove equally addictive. \\"Mirrors\\", the second single successfully straddles the line between pop and urban music.  Timberlake's superb lead vocals are supported by slick production, lovely harmonized background vocals, and strings courtesy of The Benjamin Wright Orchestra.  Pure love continues to drive Timberlake: \\"Cause I don't wanna lose you now / I'm looking right at the other half of me / the vacancy that sat in my heart / is a space that now you hold... it's like you're my mirror / my mirror staring back at me...\\" Closer \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" is mysterious and experimental. While it is interesting and creative, it drags on a few minutes too long.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BCZU8WM The 20/20 Experience]] is an enjoyable effort overall, but also flawed.  Stylistically, Timberlake's restlessness never seems unified as an entire album; cohesively, this effort is `all over the place.' Additionally, 70 minutes for 10 tracks seems a bit exhaustive, with one two many breakdowns tacked on at the end; it was less predictable on FutureSex/LoveSound. That said, there are enough solid moments to draw one back to the effort without feeling guilty.  3 ½ Stars.too long.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BCZU8WM The 20/20 Experience]] is an enjoyable effort overall, but also flawed.

B003XZ0WPM|4.0|Not sure how faithful was this adaptation from the books, but the movie stands pretty well by itself. Fun and interesting concept. A downside is that they left it open for future movies, which I heard is not happening anymore. Will have to read the books.<br /><br />In my opinion, it also had a &#34;steampunk&#34;-ish feel to it. Anyone who loves this, or alternate universes premises, shape shifting (animals), etc, will most likely enjoy this film.

1476734941|4.0|The book is great, clear and easy to read and follow.  However, I'm still not totally sold on all of the \\"science\\" behind it.<br /><br />The reason I tried it our was to lose 4-6 \\"vacation pounds\\" before a race.  The good news is I lost 4 sometimes 5 pounds and have kept it off for about 3 months.<br /><br />Now for the other news:<br /><br />- Unlike other reviewers ... I still hate the \\"fast days\\".  I do mine on Tuesday and Thursday ... these are my longest work days and where I have the least chance to cheat. But I have always cheated!  Although, as a women I'm only suppose to have 500 calories a day, I have always kept it 600-650.... and still lost and have kept off the weight. I really dislike the counting aspect and have stuck to a consistent menu on these days... it can be done and I do it, but as a grazer..... I'm always looking to keep my hands busy on these days.<br /><br />- I'm a runner and I've found I CAN NOT run the same distance on the day after my \\"fast\\" without an additional brief rest.... sometimes two. I just don't have enough fuel in my tank!<br /><br />- I didn't have a large amount of weight to lose... and I'm really doubtful that it would be possible to achieve a large amount weight lose following this.  I do however see it works for small amounts ... I'll likely keep this plan up just to maintain and maybe go to a 3 day a week \\"fast\\" plan when my next \\"vacation pounds\\" sneak up !

I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis because enough of the other reviews do so, but I highly recommend this book, and anything else by Brandon Sanderson.  I already have the hardcopy but I wanted the ebook version for when I'm on the go and don't have the space for a book.

B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game has some good points to it (graphics and game concept) but it's become frustrating beyond endurance.  With each time the game is opened, it connects to the internet and downloads anywhere from 100 to 175MB and takes its sweet time doing it.  Since the last update, it has added to this \\"anticipatory\\" joy by immediately crashing the app.  Couple that with having to buy content in-game, and I'm ready to uninstall it and move on to greener pastures.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I for one am not a huge musical fan, but this movie is so great and wonderful you forget it's a musical. This movie definitively kicked started my appreciation for the musicals. Great ride and great addition to the collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|i have watched this program thru  two seasons on PBS . I love the story line and all the chacters. Cann't wait until the third season starts.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I choose to watch this movie despite the poor reviews and am glad that I did. Charlize Theron's performance as Ravenna entranced me and completely stole the movie away from Kristen Stewart's Snow White. In fact, I kept wishing that the movie had focused more on Ravenna, and her brother Finn, since they are the most interesting characters in the movie. The movie hinted at the back story of them but I felt that it could have been elaborated much more. On that note, I would actually be closer to giving the film a 3.5 since by the end I was sort of hoping that Ravenna would finish off Snow White. Stewart's performance was just dull, with her face not really showing any feeling, and this is coming from someone who has a hard time reading peoples' feelings.<br /><br />So, the negatives of the film were, for me, the fact that the story focused on Snow White (who was not a compelling protagonist), didn't introduce the dwarfs until quite far in, and went with the whole \\"chosen one\\" explanation for why anyone should follow Snow White (just way too over used in films, as I believe another viewer mentioned). What I really liked was any scene with Ravenna in, the way the mirror was portrayed and was only seen by Ravenna, and the whole complex relationship between Ravenna and Finn. Overall I liked this movie enough to buy it, mainly because of Charlize Theron's performance, but I think that this movie is for those prepared for more action than acting...
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I had to watch it twice and got more out of the 2nd time.  So good, I ordered a copy for my daughter that is experiencing some of lifes challenges and thought this would help get her some prospective on what could be and to be thankful!<br /><br />I am going to order myself a copy for myself.  I rarely order movies, but this is definitely one that I will and want to share!<br /><br />It is a must have for your library and your life!<br /><br />Thank you for the message!

What does it mean? Did Amy snap and kill Nick? Didn't quite grasp what the last page meant. But overall great story.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Very well written, this is the kind of book that grabs you from the beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br />It also gave me a very good insight about our forefathers and the creation of this nation.

B007U8UBGI|4.0|Just what you would expect from Jack White, nothing more, nothing less. Some interesting styles used but nothing too out of the ordinary for him. If you want something different from the White Stripes, this isn't really it. But if you like the White Stripes and/or Jack White, this is a good consistent offering.
B000O76T8Q|1.0|Same like the others...where is the lenticular cover... i can't sell this item like this, sorry but i just want my money back...

B001NFU5WE|2.0|Below average, not in a good shape, but i can accepted it...just be careful with handling, you always packed it in a rush.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazingly described and it leaves me breathless. The thing I don't like about this book is that a the end Suzanne Collins didn't talk about what happened to Katniss and Peeta, I Mean they did but it's almost like she rushed it. Over all this book was breath taking and amazing!! Ps. Team Peeta and Katniss
B000ICLRIE|5.0|One of the best item i had...simply minimalist Like New item with good handling and it comes perfectly, thanks a lot
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I never saw the movie, a friend said it was depressing.  Loved the book.  I've been out of high school for over twenty years but Chbosky took my right back.  Enjoyed every minute.
B000HF7PEC|3.0|Yeah, what did i say about this thing...below average, such a poor handling, some defective wraps...but i hope more discount for such condition..
B004T2QZL8|2.0|It FC's after 20-30 seconds after opening the app, only after notifying me that &quot;You do not own the app&quot;.<br /><br />This sucks because I've been wanting to play this game for the longest time, only to find out that it craps out
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I enjoy the show.  Sometimes, it is too predictable and drawn out. However, the general setting and the production are very well done.  It is a great &#34;escape&#34; from the everyday demands of life and I thoroughly enjoy sceince fiction.
1554072840|5.0|I received this book for my daughter when she turned 2, she is now 6.  I just ordered the boy version for my 2 yr old nephew.  We still have ours, and we still read it and laugh together. It's so cute.  I scanned over a few reviews while I was ordering this book today and I felt the need to write my own.  Yes, the terminology may be a little different than the way we speak today, and yes, the \\"potty\\" looks like a flower pot.  But who cares, it's just a silly book that talks about going potty in a toilet, not the floor or your pants!  It's that simple.  It's the IDEA that we are selling to the kids.  This book is not intended to teach them what a toilet looks like (they already know) or teach them how we should be talking (they know from hearing us talk) so what's the big deal here?  The book is great, and I recommend it to anyone with a child who is potty training.  My daughter loved the way this book was written, it sparked imagination and some laughs.  Even at 2 yrs old, she knew that \\"wee wee\\" and \\"poo poo\\" were not the same words we use at home, but it worked for the story.  This was one of those books that my daughter wanted to read over and over, even long after she was totally potty trained.  It's a darling book, that is definitely different than the rest.  If parents don't like this book because it's not \\"accurate\\" then do they also not allow their children to read books like Dr. Suess?  Some children books are silly and use silly words, and kids LOVE THEM. This is a great book!  It makes a great 2nd birthday gift for any child!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Solid game play, fun unlockables and achievements. The best thing about the game is the excellent PACE out unlocks and new gear. I never felt like I had to buy the in-game currency to move forward.

B00170MYIS|5.0|My camera batteries reached their re-charging limits, so I replaced them with this new battery.  Being new, It holds a longer charge, as it should.  It's just as expected.  This was shipped very quickly.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I love this movie, my children and I watch it often.  My previous movie was to scratched to I bought another one.  It is worth it :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Funny and sad.  If anyone in your family is an Eagles fan - big plus.  Quick read, kept moving, good characters.  I'll have to see the movie one of these days...

I have followed this plan and am almost done with the 30 days but will continue as this will be a lifestyle change for the better.  This book teaches you how to eat &#34;clean&#34; and not put toxins in your body.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Daaayum! Spaceship coupe sold it for me. I like the fact that the songs are more than 7 minutes long and they have funky breakdowns. Congrats on a job well done and welcome back.
B000VI12ZS|1.0|My husband enjoyed this movie a great deal - I did not.  The underlying story of the &#34;windtalkers&#34; and their Navajo heritage was told, but it definitely could have been expanded upon.  It was mostly done with comments of the soldiers involved in the war, allowig for somewhat of a change in their fellow soldiers.  There were a one or two &#34;flashbacks&#34; and one &#34;flashforward&#34; that portrayed the &#34;windtalkers&#34; earlier life. The movie was exceeding violent and graphic in terms of war related issues.  It could have been done with a lot less blood and gore.  It was interesting to learn that the code was never broken and that it significantly helped in the winning of the war.
1416955070|5.0|This book is fantastic. Between Clare's sharp wit and her addicting character and plot construction I couldn't put this novel down. A must read for any fan of YA literature.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book.  The ending was just enough suspenseful and with just enough reality to make you realize the reality of the world we live in.
B005U9REU0|5.0|I love this movie!<br /><br />While admittedly this film doesn't have the greatest script or actors it is fun to watch and is friendly for all ages. It's certainly one of my favorite films.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|My kids watch a lot of cartoon garbage. This is a cool movie to watch with them. Its got a little sci-fi in it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The video was excellent.  The downloading of the episodes at times were a problem.  The load was slow and sometime had to be started over.  I am not sure what is causing this problem, but it does not happen with other services I use to watch videos.
B001OKJU4M|5.0|If I could choose a movie to remake and star in, it would be this movie. I think a lot of men having a bad day would love to do the things Michael Douglas does in this movie. However, most people don't want to go to prison so....

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I am an admitted Bujold Addict.  I think I finally have read all of the Vorkosigan stories and novels, and this one didn't let me down.  It was great to finally see Ivan in the driver's seat.  I always new he had it in him. . .
1402530870|4.0|I've been meaning to read the Grapes of Wrath for many years.  I've never been a particular fan of John Steinbeck, but this particular book has interested me because of the connection to my own family; my mother and her parents and siblings were among the thousands of \\"Okies\\" who immigrated to California during the Depression.<br /><br />Although my mother's family was, like all the others, very poor and worked hard just to eke out a living, thankfully they never had it quite as bad as Steinbeck's Joad family.  The Grapes of Wrath is not a happy story; that is easily foreseen from the get-go, when the Joads and others making the trek out west dream endlessly of a California that they imagine almost on a par with paradise.  A place that, of course, never existed.<br /><br />This is a story of struggle and sadness and unrelenting misery.  There are no bright spots, no happiness to give a little relief to all the hardship.  The Joad family suffers sickness and death and the slow and gradual breakup of their family.  They struggle endlessly to find enough work to feed themselves and they struggle against the injustices of the way of life they are trapped in.  The story ends inconclusively, with the reader left not knowing what will happen to them and especially what will happen to Tom Joad, the main character.  The only really conclusive point that Steinbeck seems to make in the final scene is that the Joad family will somehow survive and live on; the final scene seems meant to convey that, no matter how dire the circumstances, they always find a way to sustain themselves and keep living.<br /><br />Steinbeck's use of language is rough throughout this book, and there are many crude passages and scenes, especially in the beginning of the book.  However, there are many passages where his writing sings almost like poetry and it was this that kept me listening.  This is a poignant and powerful look at a bygone era, the Depression in general and the plight of the Okies coming to California in particular.  The fact that I live in Central California, near many of the towns mentioned in the story, brought it even that much closer to  home for me.<br /><br />It is easy to see how this book had such a powerful impact, especially since it was written during the Depression, while events such as those depicted in the story were actually taking place.  For me, the main take-away here is admiration of those who survived the trek to California and who managed to forge an existence in their new \\"promised land.\\"  I am also very thankful and appreciative for how easy my life has been by comparison.<br /><br />This is an excellent audio version; the narrator does an outstanding job and adds much to the characters and their story.g to California in particular.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|This was a great escape from our busy world to a simpler time and place.  Well-developed characters and plot.  Very enjoyable!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|First foreign film that I have ever watched to start from finish...and the BEST movie I have seen in a very long time!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story line is intriguing, and the production is eye candy between the countryside, costumes, and architecture and furnishings. Really brings you close to a very transitional era.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|i heard them on snl, and fell in love with this bans right away, they sound great, i am glad i bought this album.
B00B1ME11U|5.0|Some good 'ole rock n' roll. Support a great band a cough up the money. It's worth it. My Rocket 88 is the fastest in the land.
0988178532|5.0|As a commuter on public transportation, I read in 20 minute bites, making getting absorbed in a book a challenge. Legg successfully developed characters and a storyline in the early chapters. Quickly I was absorbed in the plot, missing my subway stop more than once! Nate is an unassuming hero, and takes the reader on a thrilling, new age journey. I recommend this book as well as look forward to Legg's sophomore novel.  Following a budding novelist is as exciting as befriending his characters.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|So I'm a fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Love Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. Thought this was going to be similar, but didn't realize that Seth Rogen was the voice for Paul. It definitely turned out to be more of a Seth Rogen movie than anything, and those I have found to be hit or miss.<br /><br />People who like Seth Rogen, this is probably a good one for you. People looking for something more like Hot Fuzz should just watch Hot Fuzz over again
0141345659|5.0|I bought this book for my teenage daughter and she loved it. She read other books by this same author and this book was good as well!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I'm glad I didn't pay for this game because it won't even install onto my device. I have a kindle fire. I don't know what's wrong but I'm sure the game is fun enough if you can get it to work.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I loved the book, it was funny and oddly enough quite historically accurate (apart from the obvious vampire hunting bits!).  The movie has lost all of that.  It has managed to just seem dull, none of the characters are interesting and for some reason they have changed large parts of the story (Henry was a great character in the book, he is completely changed in the book).
B00632HWOG|5.0|Downloaded on my HTC sensation. I love being able to access my entire mail account, but the notifications are driving me nuts, draining my battery and interrupting my music player! Settings options are minimal and have no way to change notifications.<br /><br />Update: I didn't look close enough the first time and upon searching all my options under settings, I was able to turn off all notifications!!! Loving this app!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy having a place to put all my ideas for my next abode. It is like a giant file cabinet that won't give me papercuts!
1433502410|5.0|Great cross referencing; wonderful drawing and maps. My book cover was damaged in shipping (it was sent in a padded envelope) so the cover bows out. That is the only issue I have w. it.
B0094K1PW4|1.0|Streaming from amazon is not the best. Movies are always dark and a bit blurry. You really need to team up with apple to stream movies. I'd rather give my money to Amazon than Netflix!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really a great game that takes a surprising amount of skill.  Keeps it exciting and fun while you learn the ropes.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|Streaming from Amazon is not the best. Movies are always dark and too much buffering. You really need to team up with apple to stream movies. I'd rather give my money to Amazon than Netflix!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Like Bejeweled but with a mission. Got up to level (day) 30 and kind of got bored of it. Not sure what happens when you make it to day 80.
B002Z0TPFE|5.0|This movie had lots of action and funny scenes. Can't wait for the next movie to come out, next week.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I despise  clowns with a passion and yet I had to keep playing. Great game I look forward to more!!!!
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Brings back good memories and lets me see the episodes i missed when it was on TV originally and my brother and I watched them together.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very well made movie which tells an amazing story from American History we have never heard before. Archive footage was a nice touch.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but it would be better if you could Change the skin. I am REALLY obsessed with the game
B008KPDYQY|3.0|My Fiancee and I watched this one night, but were a tad disapointed, while it was a well made movie, it wasnt the jovial comedy we were expecting, rather more of a dark romantic comedy. Still well made, just not what preveiws led us to expect.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is an amazing game! The thing I think most improved is the scenery. You are basically placed in a fortress in the clouds. It was very detailed, with bridges, ziplines, forest, and even traveling through a gem mine in a cart. The worst thing about the game is the powerups. The store was soooo confusing, and the shield let you run through one obstacle. And you can't save the shield til you make a mistake, because you have a time limit. Otherwise it's a GREAT game.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A great film.  Very well done the story is well put together.  It is something that young or old no matter your age you can enjoy.  A great film to watch as a family.  It has suspense and a good story line.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride is a really addictive game......at first. When I first got it, I couldn't put  it down for about a month. Then it was just the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over. I mean sure, they have  missions, and achievements and everything, but even they started to repeat. I would definitely buy it again, but not for any higher price.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like to play it. I had no idea what angry birds was till my grand-children told me and showed me how to play.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|After waiting over 17 years!  since his wonderful &#34;View from the Hill&#34; album, this was a disappointment in many ways.  There are only about three wonderful songs, but much of it feels uninspired and rote. Missing are the profound, heartfelt lyrics from earlier works by Mr. Hyward, and some of the melodies sound as if they were recycled from very old Moodie projects. The final two songs are both remakes of the huge hit &#34;I know you're out there&#34; and they really are bad.  Both are repetitive-especially the second one which drags on for nearly 8 minutes just repeating a portion of the main melody over and over. He took a classic and, apparently, thought he could modernize it, but he just trivialized it into a pop-inspired mess.  I liked the few blue grass inspired songs--they were fun and it was nice to show that Mr. Hayward's talent can work in that genre. Justin Hayward is truly a musical genius and a poet.  His concern for mankind and peace is evident in much of his work and it has uplifted many souls to see light, love and good through the medium of soul-filled music. I thought and hoped, as I'm sure many thousands did, that after 17 years of growth, Justin Hayward wold have reached new heights, not slipped backwards into what appears to be mainly a commercial venture (the musical equivalent of the upcoming sea cruise) with this uninspired album. Justin, what happened to your heart and spirit?  Turn back to the light.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I have always liked to play Pac-Man, even as a kid. Now I can play it as an adult so that makes it fun
B00846REIS|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Similar to 50 shades in eroticism.  Enjoyed the story itself immensely and could not wait to start the next book, Reflected in You.  Much passion was put into the story itself.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The Blu-Ray is a lot better quality with HD and deleted scenes, altogether it is a really nice package for the money.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was again an enjoyable book that I had trouble putting down.  One can find themselves lost in the moment with the characters.  Highly recommend this book if you enjoyed 50 shades.  I cannot wait until the June release of the next novel.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|Can't believe I waited so long to see this gem! Many laugh out loud moments. Want to watch it again!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I was really into the first season and liked the cool twists of our favorite fairy tales.  However, they were on the verge of losing me this second season until recently. They are trying to switch it up a bit so I will stick it out for now.
0307730697|5.0|This is a wonderful book and amazing young warrior.  It was easy to read a chapter or many then put the book down and pick up again after errands, etc....but I would have loved to have sat down & read the entire book all at once. Very inspiring - highly recommended to motivate any trouble youth/young adult--they'll see how they can survive personal issues and excel from the story of a troubled young man, Adam Brown-a true hero!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Interesting concept and presentation. Good story line, easy to follow plot, at the end of the day an enjoyable movie.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Usually by the third movie - it's predictable. And so was this one. Though still interesting enough to watch and enjoy.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Action light episodes and even a large lack of zombies in most episodes make for a lackluster season. It seems to crawl along at a frustrating pace
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was surprisingly good - considering Carter handled the entire thing poorly. This story focused on 6 of the American embassy staff that &#34;got out&#34; of the embassy before the rest were taken hostage - and how they ultimately got out of Iran with the help of the CIA conjuring up a crazy plan to make the 6 look and act like they were members of a Canadian film crew.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|As usual,  Bocelli's new CD is wonderful, great songs!  Love it<br /><br />I recommend it highly to anyone who loves Bocelli
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I think the movie tries to make you have sympathy for the drug-abusing alcoholic pilot, who flew stoned but somehow saved most of the passengers during a malfunction (fault of the airline/manufacturer), by flipping the plane and flying upside down to keep it from diving. Then right-siding it again. Yeah, right. If you have drug abusers or alcoholics in your family, you will not enjoy this.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|What can I say, I love a good twist and turn to a storyline. And I love the calmness in which the actors perform their characters in the story.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was stupid. And somewhat boring and predictable. Hard to believe Marky Mark would even bother with such a movie.
1606995359|5.0|I was reading Uncle Scroge since I was able to read, and got a lot of enjoyment out of this.  I wil buy the whole series
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my kids love these kind of puzzles. it keeps them quiet and entertained while we're on the go and I love how it is ready enough for a 3 year old to do but still good enough for a 5 year old too.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this when it came out in hardback and loved the story...of course, you have to remember that it is a fictional story. I downloaded it for my kindle since it was free and I plan to read it again.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book was much better than I ever expected.  I loved watching Darcy evolve from the self-centered, shallow, Something Borrowed Darcy, to a sweet, caring, motherly Darcy!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was very surprised and spellbound by this.  Watched 2 seasons in 2 days.<br />Can't wait till season 3 is available and season 4 starts again. Actors are great<br />and story very good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very interesting period show. Enough drama to keep the attention, enough love to keep the feelings moving. I look forward to seeing season 4.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Got this app out of boredom and I am loving it! It is turning out to be more fun than I could have imagined! I took up the \\"Free gem\\" offer and never received the gems. I emailed several times and have gotten no help. It has been over a month now with no fix.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very interesting period show. Enough drama to keep the attention, enough love to keep the feelings moving. I look forward to seeing season 4.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a an awesome bag pack. I use it for all my camera gear. It fit easily two camera bodies and at least 4 more lenses. Highly recommend it.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I play the music from the Harry Potter movies all the time and don't get tired of them.  Even the later CD's when things get more 'dark', the music is done so well. If you like Harry Potter movies, you will not be disappointed in the soundtracks.
B00AYCOUOG|4.0|first off, let's just all pretend that \\"head music\\" and \\"a new morning\\" never happened. right? right. they were tired, forced and uninspired albums with only a moment or two of genuine suede-esque moments.  it seemed suede would be heaped on the britpop dustpile, forgotten by a new generation (pardon the pun) of audiophiles. yet, here they are eleven years later, rejuvenated and revitalized and surprisingly spry for a band entering it's third decade.<br /><br />'bloodsports,' if not quite a return to form, is certainly a step in the right direction.  this is the album that should have followed 'coming up.' it's got the same sort of fizzy-transistor-radio-glam rock sound that made 'coming up' such a great album.  the songs on 'bloodsports' are uniformly tight and expertly played.  richard oakes may never be able to escape the spectre of bernard butler, but he's proven to be an thoroughly expert axeman and songsmith. the rhythm section of simon gilbert, mat osman and neil codling is great too.  yeah, brett's voice is shot, but there's a certainly rapsy sexiness to it.<br /><br />the album opener, 'barriers,' is classic suede and a great opening track with it's rolling drum line and catchy chorus.  \\"it starts and end with you\\" is probably the album's high point - it's all high energy, crunchy guitars, and soaring vocals. the double chorus is a nice touch, too. you'll be hard-pressed not to sing along.  it's a great throwback to britpop's heyday. 'hit me,' 'snowblind' and 'sometimes i think i'll float away' are all top tracks and potential singles, especially 'hit me.' it's got the same propulsive energy as 'new generation' or 'animal nitrate.'<br /><br />one other reviewer commented on brett anderson's lyrics - while maybe a tad overstated, he's right.  some of brett's lyrical choices are downright goofy. how does a man who penned \\"she-thug stuttered through a stereo dream, a fifty-knuckle shuffle heavy metal machine' write something as banal and pedestrian as \\"all the colors of the rainbow don't compare with one look in your impossible eyes?\\"  it's a head-scratcher i'm still struggling to figure out.<br /><br />that said, 'bloodsports' is a respectable and confident album that shows suede has plenty left in a tank that was thought to have run dry.  hopefully it's a springboard to bigger and better things.colors of the rainbow don't compare with one look in your impossible eyes?\\"  it's a head-scratcher i'm still struggling to figure out.<br /><br />that said, 'bloodsports' is a respectable and confident album that shows suede has plenty left in a tank that was thought to have run dry.  hopefully it's a springboard to bigger and better things.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|My expectations may have colored my rating somewhat. Having seen and/or read LOTS of zombie books and movies, I was expecting something closer to Walking Dead. This is a VERY different approach to apocalyptic literature. This is exactly what it says -- An Oral History of what happened. That means that at times it reads a little more like a textbook than a novel. There were parts of the book that were a little slow, and far more detailed than I cared about. (Long descriptions of weapons, military tactics, etc.)<br /><br />On the other hand, I liked having stories about lots of different experiences instead of just focusing on one group. It was interesting seeing different approaches by both individuals and countries. I also liked a sweeping overview of the whole experience, as opposed to how most movies or novels start in the middle of the action -- after the plague has started and ending once our hero(es) are mostly safe.<br /><br />I know they are making a movie, and I will probably go see it, but I can't help thinking that it might make an interesting serialized version (like a TV show).  Walking Dead may be as much zombie action as we can stand right now, but with the right writers and approach, this could be really good. I would focus on one country/area/storyline per season, and then start the next one somewhere else. Characters could show up in other storylines, or -- as done so cleverly in American Horror Story -- actors could play a completely different character the next season. Just an idea!<br /><br />I did like parts of this book very much, and I liked that the zombie plague wasn't the end of the story. So much apocalyptic literature (both zombie and nuclear) has a tendency to feel rather hopeless, but I think as humans, we are pretty good at adapting and overcoming even overwhelming odds.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is simply amazing!! I like how its so informative and gives me really awesome ideas for all kinds of things! Definitely recommend this site to all my friends!

B007W7P5L8|5.0|I have had Marware Vibe Case Cover for several weeks. It is perfect for what I needed. Use it all the time for hands free reading and protects my Kindle Fire.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent entertainment. Was pleased to see someone write an engaging book with so few characters yet kept me reading. Clever and well thought out.
4770030088|4.0|I bought this book in conjunction with a class I was taking.  I have used it for the last 2 months.  The book was easy to understand and it offered lots of practice opportunities and examples of &#34;real life&#34; conversations.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play on my kindle fire. Its like sim city and zoo tycoon but with dinosaurs. Code red mode gives it more of a challenge if it starts to get boring. My kids like it too.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|You will not stop til the end. Can't wait to order part two. But first I will play the more difficult version. Buy this game now!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wonderful book, could not put it down, good story, lots of information about hiking. Just a really good book. I would reccomend it to everyone.
B000003N7K|5.0|I realize that my comment about this being possibly one of the most romantic albums is dripping with personal opinion with a touch of hyperbole. To my ears, though, it is definitely mood-setting.<br /><br />Listen to the sound samples on this page to get a sense of this album. Those will say far more than I ever could. As for the discussions about how far apart Coltrane and Hartman were musically - as a musician I could indulge in that, but I think it's pointless. The music on each track speaks for itself. We all have different tastes, but I will reveal that Billy Strayhorn's 'Lush Life' is my favorite track.<br /><br />Now for a little confession: I only recently discovered this album. A friend and I were discussion perfect music for a romantic evening and I confidently said there was nothing better than a Chet Baker album. She suggested this one instead. With skepticism I checked this one out and immediately agreed with her.<br /><br />Hartman himself said that every track on the album is a first take except 'You Are Too Beautiful', which needed to be redone because Elvin Jones dropped one of his sticks during the first pass. If that's true, then the ensemble must have been in rare form because the final results of that session is pure magic.<br /><br />The session was recorded for the Impulse label at Rudy Van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs studio on March 7, 1963. Hartman was backed by the 1963 edition of Trane's ensemble: with Coltrane on tenor sax, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass and Elvin Jones on drums.<br /><br />One final note: this album is offered with Amazon's new (at the time of this review) AutoRip feature in which after purchasing the physical album you get immediate access to a digital copy to which you can download to your player or play from their cloud. This means that you don't have to wait to hear why I am gushing about this album.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|just got it still working on it.  but I know I will like it.  Its different then what I am use too but I will figure it out, thats part of the fun
B000FC12ZA|3.0|I read Mutant Message upon the enthusiastic recommendation of a friend, so the book resonates with some folks. The ecological message is important, but the book takes a tedious path to deliver it.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|a litrtle bit of everything ,twists and turns ,enjoyable ,would reccond to others ,get your prime on and score with this one
B000001GQC|4.0|There's a lot of really great recorded music on this album with very good dynamic range. The highlight of course, is the suite Prokofiev extracted from the Eisenstein WWII Soviet Propaganda film, \\"Alexander Nevsky\\", complete with a wonderful chorus and dark mezzo adding real drama to this performance led by Maestro Abbado.<br />However, after some critical listening, and a bit of software evaluation with a phase 'scope, I discovered there is a serious technical flaw in the CD transfer of \\"Nevsky\\" that I'm just plain astonished escaped the talented \\"tonmeisters\\" at Deutsche Gramophone!<br />It turns out that my ears were indeed on to something:  there is a very serious sonic problem with this release! Apparently, nobody doing the CD remastering bothered to check their phase 'scopes for the final CD master: One of the audio channels of the \\"Nevsky\\" recording is completely out of phase with the other channel! This anomaly leads to reduced bass, \\"wandering\\" image, and a vague spaciousness that doesn't sound natural. This is especially noticeable during the soloist singing in Track 6, \\"Field of the Dead\\", on this album. The singer's voice, rather than staying stable in the center of the musical stage, suddenly moves dramatically about as if she was walking back and forth across the stage during the performance!<br />This phasing difficulty can be easily rectified by some playback systems, albeit more rudimentary systems require swapping the speaker wires to one channel, if there's no \\"Channel Phase Reversal\\" switch on the playback equipment. The resultant sound, once this out of phase \\"glitch\\" is corrected, becomes much more cohesive, with impactful bass, a far more full orchestral ambience, and stable imaging.<br />The Chicago Symphony recordings do not seem to suffer the same fate!<br />It is regrettable that this CD is indeed flawed by this oversight, which should not have made it to commercial CD release with this problem.
B008M7JODC|5.0|So far we've really enjoyed Fringe.  We like the premise and overall arc of the show so far.  The fact that its all based on fringe science allows the show to do some crazy stuff that can still be considered &#34;believable&#34;.  While some of the episodes can be a little out there, they are still well written and the characters easily make up for a sketchy episode base.  While the &#34;main&#34; character is a standard hard but sexy heroine with obvious problems, she is backed up by a great team.  Walter Bishop (the mad scientist) plays an amazing role.  His character is by far our favorite as he has all the best lines and is crazy in a believable way (much like most of this show).  While many of the episodes are &#34;stand alone&#34; they mostly follow a giant conspiracy arc that is really well done.<br /><br />Overall, if you liked X-Files, this is pretty much it with better acting, better stories, and better production value.  If you didn't like X-files (but didn't absolutely hate it) I'd still give it a few episodes as the character interaction is great and the stories are usually well made.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Dear Hollywood, stop trying to shove your silly Ultraviolet nonsense down my throat.  I have a HUGE collection of DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. But I no longer buy new releases unless they come with an ITunes digital copy.  If you want my money then sell me what I want.
B000IZXR20|2.0|I can't say I watch lot of movies specially horror movies, but this movie does not seem a movie that I want to keep in my movie library. I can say few things that I liked in this movie which is how it got filmed and the makeup specially the jeeper creeper makeup and costumes!..I can put also some credit to the acting as it kept me following the story line even that the plot was the worst I noticed..It wasn't so intersting story line (plot) as I kind of predicted most of what will happen except the ending!<br /><br />It is a movie that I am surely watch once.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Awesome.  The nice thing about the Blu-Ray Revolution is when the classic series' come out.  This along with Star Wars, James Bond, Back to the Future, etc., make spending a little more well worth it.<br /><br />Watch this on a hi-def 55&#34; TV with Surround Sound.  Wow.
1250010403|5.0|This is the second of Clifton Chronicles, read the first one then this.  Waiting for number three to come out.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love this show, and this season was better than the first.  I felt that Dr. Watson's character was less stiff, and easier to watch.  And the plots were a lot of fun.  Good job.
1936608898|5.0|When my daughter first told us about this book and the &#34;Paleo Diet&#34;  I was a skeptic. After doing the &#34;WHOLE30&#34; as suggested in the book with my wife I am not. Both of us DO feel better, both of us have more energy and have lost weight.<br />this book pulled together a lot of the things I already knew about food, where we in the US get our food and the chemistry that goes into the marketing of food to the population. It is a bit scary, when put all together.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who eats food, vegan or not.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I was looking for an alliterative to Iheart radio my Tablet was not installing it correctly, with this app it made the grade quite nicely tons of stations, no breaks and commercial free music , I gave it a 4 star cause it's not Iheart ...very good app all the same.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I went into this with an open mind because friends and family didn't seem to like it.  I loved the change in style.  Might even be better than the last few.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Love the story and the insight into autism- learned a lot and enjoyed every moment. Wish the author wrote more of these!
B008FC4WA4|3.0|I sampled book and liked it. Paid two dollars and story ended five pages later. What a ripoff. Save your money.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game it is so cute!!! Very fun and addictive and Om Nome the little green monster is so cute!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The basic story is intriguing.  Oliver is believed dead but has actually washed ashore on a &#34;deserted&#34; island...that isnt deserted.  He comes back after so many years (but it hasnt yet said HOW he got back) and now he hunts down criminals listed in a mysterious notebook.  Of course the character is great looking, rich, mysterious and yet he has a slight sense of humor and a gentle side. I cant wait for next year.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie was great and not just for my 6 year old, but for adults too.  Great characters and a lot of comedy.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The tiles are all Chinese letters. My 8 year old granddaughter and I, at 80 years, were sitting together and she could do it and win and I couldn't . I was just looking for for the tiles with the birds, flowers, wind and dragons!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best series I have watched in a really long time. The story lines pull you in and you just keep wanting more.  Cannot wait for season 4 to be released.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This season of PLL was incredible. Every episode had twists and turns I never saw coming. I am already counting down the days until the season 4 premiere!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I absolutely love and recommend this series to everyone.  It is so well written and the acting is superb.  Definitely a must have in your DVD collection.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|Alford Hitchcock and his vivid imagination.I love his movies there classics, however that's when horror movies made its mark .I had to watch it to write a paper on it for a class.
0300169787|5.0|Worth the $30. Love it amazing piece of fashion history. Highly recommend this to any one considering buying this beautiful book.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|the movie starts out scary and creepy things started to happen,but then goes down hill at the end.a devilish monster taking the souls of children then having them kill their own family members,well what happen at the end ...what happens to the rest of his family?
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|\\"What about now\\" is a big step up from Bon Jovi's \\"Circle\\" album from a few years back.  I am a Bon Jovi Superfan!  I have all of their albums (and that big old box set!). \\"What about Now\\" when it is first listened too, kinda sounds slow and boring!  There, I said it.  The only song that I liked was \\"Because we can.\\"  However, I gave it a few more spins (remember I'm old, so I still speak vinyl lingo!).  The album hit me like a freight train!  \\"I'm with you\\" bled into \\"what about now\\" to \\"amen\\" and so on.  I love those songs!  That song about the water sounded like a stupid idea, but it's my favorite song on the album.  How does Bon Jovi get away with this???  I am a Mumford & Sons freak, but I can still listen to Bon Jovi?  I am a snob, but Bon Jovi gets me!  I love their passion and song writing skills.  They mean what they sing!!!  Sure, they write in cliche.  So f-ing what!  They know how to sell a song, that has and will always be their strength.  I love them for it.  I can now say, that this album gets an A+.  My original grade would have been a C+.  You have to listen to this album more than once, and not be a snob about it.  I think this is their best since \\"lost highway\\" which was my last Bon Jovi obsession.  By the way, What's left of me is another great song.  Is is done or written in a unique way?  No way, but Bon Jovi sings it like it is.  And I for one, buy it, hook-line-sinker!  A great comparison is Nirvana!  I loved them, but lyrically they were a little short (no springsteen poetics here).  However, Kurt could sell the angst and add meaning to trite lyrics.  He gave them meaning.  It's the same here.  Rock on, Bon Jovi...I'm not worthy.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|This movie should of been better than that.I thought i was in for a horror movie not drama.I didn't care to much for the ending.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I discovered this band by accident just before this cd was out. This band got me interested so I was quite looking forward to this album.<br />Luckly I wasn't disappointed, it was my favorite album last year. The music is really original an beautiful.<br />An easy recommendation!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|They need to change the story line..... if they are going to continue making 007.The action is the same and  James Bond action scenes are the same ...
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This movies has a great story to it, I never read the book but would like to after watching the flim
B000L53D4O|5.0|The kids really like it. I do wish more children's toys were made in America. My little grandson has enjoyed it as he learned to walk.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie it has a great story to it and has great actors. Plus I fly all the time so I was interested.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|My five year old and I sat together and watched the movie from beginning to end with minimal interruptions, which as anyone that has had a five year old can attest, is no small thing. There was enough adult humor hidden in the subtext to keep it entertaining for me, and my five year old loved the spin placed on Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman and the Tooth Fairy. Overall, a great family movie.<br /><br />Word of warning - - be prepared to talk about whether all the characters are real or not, and whether or not YOU believe. I do, so it was no problem for me, but for all you skeptics/haters out there who are just letting your kids believe because that's what you're supposed to do, get your response ready before playing the movie, because the topic will come up.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is not my usual subject to read.. it was reccomended to me by my son in law...I read American Sniper first by Chris Kyle.. took my breath away !!!! Lone Survivor.....was the most AMAZING book I have ever had the pleasure of reading... just goes to show what OUR military goes thru... his account of this personal experience made me wonder... just how determined our men/women are and how ,much they love America... it was an INTENSE read.....I have since bought a few other books on this subject matter..... I don't know of anyone but a SEAL that could endure what Marcus Lutrell did,,, his determination !!!!! Also opened my eyes to all the WRONG information the news media tells us !!!! I highly recomend this book... even if its not a subject your familiar with....it's a very emotional and sometime heartbreaking story...but none the less THE TRUTH !!!!<br /><br />I would like to thank all our  military for protecting our freedoms..................HOOYAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Such a great book!  From beginning to end, I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I cried, I l loved it!!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|The ES file explorer is a good tool for doing all basic and advanced file operations on Android OS. I would definitely recommend it to all.
B007HOOAH6|1.0|This is a huge waste of money! Don't buy this book............ junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I think this book Was very good it had adventure  It was scary and I couldn't stop reading it I hope other people will like it to thanks for reading.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|Great movie a family favorite! Its something the whole house can enjoy plus if you have ever been to monsters Inc and been that guy you feel contacted to it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Second installment. No disappointed here. It was a great read, just as good as the first. Give it a try, it won't disappoint!!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album took a lot of thought and effort. I couldn't ask for a better comeback album from someone who said they may not return to doing music.
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome read better than 50 Shades. Can't wait for June for the next one. A really great read, you gotta try it.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|My husband's friend recommended this show to us, so I got the first season on DVD from Amazon and we watched all of the episodes in a few days! We can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD later this year so we can catch up before season 3 airs.
6305910324|4.0|I was very pleased with the condition of the DVD Searching For Bobby Fischer that I received. The packaging was well done and the story was almost as good as I remembered.  There are other DVD on the market since this one was made and I think any reader that liked this one would enjoy owning Knights of the South Bronx with Ted Danson.<br />Many thanks for helping me with my order for Searching for Bobby Fischer. I will be ordering again soon Amazon is the greatest!  Just wish I could find a way to order books and have them sent to my Kindle and not only to my IPad .<br />Keep up the great work I have believed in the Amazon concept since its birth !
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of my new favorite shows and the quality on Amazon prime is awesome. You will not be disapointed
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It is so good! We love Storybrook. Regina and Mr. Gold, they're weird. Of course wisdom lies in the young.<br />Watch this.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Loved it - action scenes were fantastic and the detail was excellent. Even my 3 year old loved the jets!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A great show with wonderful characters that continue to evolve.  The scripts are clever and sincere, with some of the best quips ever from Maggie Sith.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome it is just epic I can not believe you get your own horse and you get to ride it train it. also you can bring them to competions. you also make their food and clean the pen.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|As a guy, I feel no shame in admitting that this is my favorite romance movie. It is simply a must see.
1884883303|4.0|4 stars because there is always room for improvement, specifically its a little hard to find exactly what you want, some products are either not in there or where just too hard to locate....
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|It seems strange to describe a simple game as thought provoking, but it is. You can play this game for hours.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so fun I'm already on set 25. I just now updated Otto where it is Rome and hoave 29 eggs<br />the only :hint I don't like about it is it makes me force close the game a lot I don't know why
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Love this workout. It's very easy to follow. It doesn't pause in between exercises and IT IS a excellent workout.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|If you love story telling, this is an amazing movie. C.S. Lewis said we love narratives because there is a greater narrative. This movie will leave you thinking deeply about the narrative of life.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall was in no way a disappointment, Daniel Craig is equal part rough and tumble, and part gentleman.  Sam Mendes did an amazing job directing this film through several different locations.  He kept our eyes peeled with the usual car/gun/gadget porn.  The Bond girls were as always stunning.  And it was nice to see the story take a turn back to its roots.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Very interesting approach to magic and power! Had to buy the whole series to satisfy myself. Endearing characters, story imaginative, overall great series!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thank you for having this available so I could catch-up on what I missed!  The characters are so engrossing!  I cannot wait for next season...
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I had the movie on dvd then the blu-ray was on sale for a Joss Whedon sale or something. So Serenity, Firefly series, and Dollhouse were all purchased. A great man, that Joss Whedon.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|An amusing toy at first, then it became an annoying waste of time.  I feel sure that some people will enjoy it, just not me.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love the series and in blu-ray it's just fantastic. Extra features are great to see. I don't recall if they were on the dvd, but there's a gag reel and the audition tapes. Joss Whedon for president!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Honestly there isn't anything comparable on tv. Both the scenery and characters are incredible! But  beware though that one you start, you can't stop!
B000V86OKG|5.0|My mind was completely blown when I watched this season! This is easily one of the best TV shows out there today.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Pink Floyd was just what my husband wanted to get for Valentine's day.  I ordered it a little late...but he was happy anyway.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is one of the best seasons of Dexter! I showed my cousin 3 episodes of this season and he called me a week later saying that he was already on season 6. So...yeah its a great show!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|At first I didn't think I would enjoy this book because of the format, going from present time to the past and back, but once you get reading it grabs you and becomes difficult to put the book down.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|BEST SHOW EVER! the third season was amazing! not quite as amazing as season 1 and 2 but pretty much just as awesome BUY IT!!!! NOW!!!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Watched the second season in 1 day.  Couldn't stop watching, amazing show.  I honestly can't wait for the third season!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommed this book to anyone. You don't want to put it down. I can't wait to read more of her books.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|My friends had told me this show was good, but it well exceeded my expectations.  Watched the first season in a few days.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I called Amazon and this was recommended as a replacement for my First Generatioin Kindle charger.  It does not fit.<br />And they do not sell the chargers anymore. I have to return it.  I am trying another usb cable sold on Amazon by a third party.  If this doesn't work, I guess I can't use my Kindle anymore.  I don't know where to else to find a charger
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think that this says that no matter how you look you can exceed and it made me teary eyed in a few spots in the book
1603429999|5.0|All I can say is that every serious knitter should own this book. I have only had this book for about a month now and I have learned so much from it.  I now can do a closed cast on, do a better join in the round, and the magic loop.  I'd say that this is not bad for the short period I have owned it.  There were so many things that my knitting teacher could not show me, I decided to find a book that could give me the lessons I wanted to learn.  I was impressed with all the posiitive reviews and that was so helpful.  Knitters, be good to yourself and get yourself a copy of this book.  You will not be sorry.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I stumbled across this book and am quite happy I did. Interesting story that I never figured out. I like books that aren't predictable. Great book, no cussing, kept me guessing the entire time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is very different from the movie but just as good. An enjoyable read. I recommend it. Very good.
B0054SMID0|3.0|exciting, unpredictable, and good ending in a very difficult clientele to deal with.  Do not miss it.  It has a surprise ending.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this app for my grandkids, and they played it, Only finding out that the game charges for its extra stuff.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books and loved them. The movie is faithful to the book and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to see if they go one to the other two.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The second best show on TV (Breaking Bad is my favorite).  The acting is really good.  I will certainly get season two on streamimg video from you guys when it comes out!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I've tried many Mahjong games, some of which even kept crashing my phone. This works great, has the added push of being timed, and is challenging enough to be fun, plus the auto shuffle feature is great, why didn't anyone else do this?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really love watching this show its the best tv show i ever seen cant wait for each show to come on
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I bought this app for my daughter who loves to draw, but is not that into computers. She does some amazing work on this little app and now I have to fight her for my kindle fire! The tools are very responsive and have lots of nice features available. Saves me a bundle on paper!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|But the movie is even better than the book, and that's rare<br /><br />Also neither the book nor the movie are suitable for young kids
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I enjoyed the series very much, the 2 main characters were well played and cont to offer mysteries in their own lives.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I got this movie in about a week from ordering and it came in some great packaging and there's really nothing to complain about, its great. The only problem is I can't open it to see if the disc works because this is not for me, this is for a person that means a lot to me and loves this movie.... so hopefully, the disc will work perfectly and for a long time and that she enjoys it very much. Anyways, overall great product.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Probably the least engaging of his books. Many of the characters didn't ring true and the plot felt contrived as though the last was making a desperate attempt to pull all the strings together. I liked that he tried to portray prisoners and a black one at that.
0141345659|4.0|Teens have plenty of problems without medical issues, but this book handles both with insight and sensitivity. I liked it enough to give to my 14 year old granddaughter.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I had honestly been avoiding this movie for a couple weeks because I thought it could be boring. I figured OK, plane crash and then boring. WRONG!!! This was very good and captivating the whole way through. Great look at addiction is an honest and entertaining way. Plus Denzel...'Nuff said.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|Full disclosure: I am a huge fan of Helen Hunt. I adore everything she does, her depth, her authenticity, her intelligence, her range, and her inner beauty. Her outer beauty too... except that she has a rare gift of being able to dispense with vanity: instead of trying to look pretty, she gives from within herself in ways that let us see the hidden scars while sharing her joy with us.<br /><br />That aside, I would still give this movie 5 stars in its own right as a brilliant adaptation of Wilde's play, replacing the buffoonery and silliness of the original with heartfelt drama, characters you get to know well enough to care about, and a well told story that captivates and elevates without artifice. I feel enriched for having seen it.
B005MMYPIE|5.0|Loved it and received it about a month ahead of expected delivery.  I haven listened to it at least 50 times over since and been promoting the band and amazon because of it
B000053VAZ|4.0|This is just a classic, enjoyable movie.  I find it quirky and hilarious.  Johnny Depp does a great job with such a unique character.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I thought this was a great novel. It was better then Gone Girl in my opinion. It kept you guessing throughout the book.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The name itself gives description to the movie.  It's very dark and unusual, but also very good.  Jake G plays his troubled character very well and definitely steals the show.  You definitely have to keep an open mind to be able to enjoy this psychological thriller, but if you can do that, it's totally worth it!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The alarm runs for 10mins or until its turned off. Ive been happy with it. I keep it plugged in at night anyway,so battery power is no problem. I like that I don't have to have the screen on for the alarm to go off.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I have loved this movie from the very first time I ever watched it.  I like the fact that it's something different from the typical animated movies!  The message is very touching and the characters are so lovable.
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva Cassidy continues to stir souls long after her death. What a talent and what a strong woman. I would have like to know her.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Classic movie! My teenagers loved it as much as I did as a kid.  Impeccable quality - streamed far better than netflix does on the same machine.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love that this game is so realistic. It honestly amazes me. It is also very much like Sims City 2000, which I also love.
B000063DFN|5.0|IT IS IRON MAIDEN- WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY!<br /><br />THIS IS AN ALBUM THAT I LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER!
0312600844|3.0|I expected a much more interesting book. It was too drawn out for what it is, and not very relatable, which made it difficult to get into. Still pretty well written and smooth reading. There was no readily apparent human commentary that I noticed beyond the general idea that there are some messed up families and people. That we are confined, and confine ourself while seeking freedom, and in this respect I like the book. But it could been more powerfully said, if only I could like the characters more, but they're such archetypes that it's difficult to.

B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I loved this book, so  I had high expectations for the film, which I found to be uninspiring. I think Lee is a great director, but this fil didn't move me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game,i can play it any where i go, everything its so big,and it makes me relax and forget the day
B009AP2G26|5.0|But the best part is that now I can watch it on Hulu-plus on my TV for $7.99 a month, (as well as millions of other things) rather than pay $1.99 an episode.
B0015DROBO|5.0|this book couldn't put it down, took it very were i when,i was working couldn't  stop thinking what was going to happen on the next chapter
B00BMCAM6M|2.0|Needs an upgrade for KF to include my stations as is now available on android google play and on the web.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fun game. Can eat up a lot of time just swimming around eating everything in sight. Snagging the parasailor is especially satisfying,  but each new shark only lets you eat a few new critters and dive a little deeper,  so it is essentially the same game every time.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|A new Justin Timberlake album is finally upon us.  His last album, 2006's FutureSex/Lovesounds, was a brilliant and expertly-crafted pop extravaganza.  It proved to the world that Timberlake was downright serious about his commitment to music.  So now it's been seven years, and we are blessed with The 20/20 Experience.  True to its name, this album is truly an experience.  The album is meticulously-conceived, and shines a new light on Timberlake as an artist.<br /><br />Just as FutureSex was a stark evolution from his debut album, Justified, The 20/20 Experience shows tremendous growth.  This is a pop album that traverses the abstract.  It's refreshing to hear this, as so few artists have gone here.  First single \\"Suit & Tie\\" provides a good glimpse of the groove that 20/20 showcases throughout its 10-track, 70-minute runtime.  It's also the most commercially palatable song on the album.  All the other tracks clock in at around 7-8 minutes each.  I was wondering why a seven-year hiatus only yielded 10 songs...it's because that's what would fit on the CD!  Essentially, the typical verse-chorus-verse pattern of the average pop song takes up the first half of the track, before a freestyle-type segue takes over for the rest of the time.  This works most of the time, though it can also get a bit taxing on some tracks.  Timbaland's production is in fine form, though some parts sound overly familiar at this point (remember Timbaland was literally EVERYWHERE for a few years).  But Timberlake himself is always on point.  His smooth vocals are spot-on, and he sounds like he's giving 150% to this album.<br /><br />As for the songs themselves, most are surefire winners.  The album has a romantic theme throughout...like Marvin Gaye meets Prince.  There aren't any danceable tracks like \\"Love Stoned\\" or \\"SexyBack\\" here.  However, they all sound fantastic...with the exception of the ridiculous \\"Spaceship Coupe\\", whose lyrics are cheesy to a ludicrous degree.  \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\", \\"Tunnel Vision\\" and \\"Let the Groove Get In\\" are easily the highlights of the album though.  And the opening track \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" perfectly sets the tone of the record.<br /><br />If you like smooth R&B, you should definitely check this album out.  If you're looking for radio-friendly pop, you may be turned off by this record though.  In my opinion, however, this is a welcome return for Timberlake, and it truly suggests that he is a musical force to be reckoned with.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|just a classic movie with the best singing / dance / musical scene at the end! love it!! wish i had a day like this in my childhood.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Kristin Scott-Thomas plays a American journalist married to a French man living in Paris. They are trying to find more space for their crowded family and eventually dedcide to renovate her husband's parent's flat which leads to the discovery of an unpleasant part of her family's life.<br /><br />\\"Sarah's Key\\" tells the story of the French government inprisoning Jewish citizens during World War II in an effort to appeasse the Nazis. It is a part of history that I knew very little about and the film does a great job of depicting the sad chapter. As Julia (Scott-Thomas) digs into her husband's family's history, she uncovers the story of Sarah, a ten-year old who lived in the same apartment with her family, before they were taken to an interment facility by the French government.<br /><br />The story is emotional, believable and heart wrenching. But the studio is trying to market this as a film with a great surprise, a great reveal. It doesn't have that. Pretty early on, you know what this big reveal will be, so it seems anticlimatic and mars the overall experience.<br /><br />Scott-Thomas is great and you can see how the realization of the horror is affecting her.
0425263908|3.0|Fell in love Gideon Cross.  Story has well written, complex characters and great for fans of Fifty Shades of Grey.
0453005071|4.0|Never been a fan of horror novels, but wanted to read Rage, hoping to learn more about the subject.  I recommend his essay, &#34;Guns.&#34;  We should be able to use some of his good ideas, but I fear our gun culture wants it the way it is.<br /><br />And it will stay this way until we have had enough.  Enough of the gun violence, and enough of those who mindlessly proclaim THEIR rights with no regard to their responsibility.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This show made me recommit my love for country music.  The soundtrack is fun, soulful, and the only complaint I have is that it should have been longer
0307383415|5.0|There is wisdom that transcends generations in here! While reading take note that this story was published 13 years before his presidency (for all its political bullets). This book accounts for Barack Obama's journey of self-discovery. His journey parallels to humanity's plight throughout history. For me, the story was less about race and more about internal conflicts family members possess. The internal struggles that all humans face might lead to passions. The story contemplates the cost of what is gained by a new generation. Favorite Quote from a wise old African woman: \\"What I have not seen does not make my heart heavy.\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can't stop playing! Want to get farther &amp; farther! Better graphics &amp; like that you can advance to other characters.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Went through the case interview process myself many years ago so I am past it now. This book would have been a very valuable tool for me at that time however. Great step by step instruction and guidence on how to get through and prepare for the case interview. Recommend it highly.
B00BMVTTJ4|2.0|The directors of \\"The Hobbit\\" seemed to be more concerned with humor and special effects than a story line. Characters were misrepresented and scenes lost there context due to these distractions.<br /><br />I think the dwarfs in this movie were weakly portrayed. Their characteristics where that of a gnome than a dwarf. The dwarf in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is my basis for what I expect a dwarf to act like.<br /><br />Humor and special effects are always great in any movie; however, if it is done improperly (as it was here) it distracts from the story line. A few well timed remarks of irony or a character which showed a sense of humor would have been appropriate. This movies had everyone making remarks throughout them movie. The special effects were good but without well trained actors the directors seemed to relied to heavily on them. This made the fight scenes hard to follow and added time to the movie for filler scenes.
B00454U1NS|3.0|She has a few good songs but stupid lyrics kill her talent. She sounds like a rebellious teenager in some songs and the lyrics in others are silly.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Just like 'Time to Kill' , this delivers. Great storyline with a twist at the end. I was hooked from the beginning.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|A riveting story of being a sniper in Iraq/Afghanistan.  Gives you a feel for the excitement and dangers. A portrait of a daring personality.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I liked the story line. I would have liked the have know a bit more of his past after he was adopted to see how his character developed.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I didn't expect much from this story because I thought the title was a little ~silly~.  However, this turned out to be a very good story!  I loved the characters and their interactions with each other.  Very sweet story!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|While the story is well-written too many loose ends remain. I enjoyed the neurological aspects as well as the parenting studies but finished the book with too many questions left.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is the first book that I read by Jodi Picoult and I am absolutely in love with this author!  I cannot say enough good about this book; the story is so heartfelt and really makes you feel something!  The characters are so well developed; I still think about them, even though I finished the book weeks ago.  I could not put this book down!  Anything else I was doing in my life, had me thinking about this book and these characters and what was going to happen next!<br /><br />This is my favorite book of the year!  I look forward to reading more of Jodi Picoult's books!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is an easy read,  shows how accessible the human spirit really is and will leave your heart smiling. :-)

B00B49L7JY|5.0|This was a great story on how a Detroit singer would become a big star over seas in Africa and how no one ever knew much about Him here in the United States. Amazing person and great songs.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|This is a fantastic season, and I would argue this is better than the first season by far. It has more intrigue, more plot twist and Sherlock Holmes realizing he's not perfect.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I liked the competition between the two towns.  The cast is great and it is a show any age can watch.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great Show! Writers for this show are great and Michael Chiklis plays this part so well you dont want the show to end

B001UTW7QU|2.0|A friend and I have been watching this show together because on it's surface it seemed like something that we would enjoy. Sadly the very fake science and Anna Torv's bad acting have made it difficult to get through season 1. The best part of the show are the funny moments supplied by Joshua Jackson and John Noble.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love, love, love the show!  It is a glimpse into a turning point in England's history.  Very interesting and entertaining!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I think this is high quality television at its best. No graphic violence, blood & guts, disrespectful language, nudity, or other crap. I wish we could have more of this kind of entertainment.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It has its slow moments like any other bond film but overall I think its a very well put together and executed movie. If you never seen it befor and if you are thinking about it I would tell you to just see it. Because 007 movies are like pizza, when its not good , its still not bad. But this film I think it to be one of the good ones.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I liked the series. I suppose it reflects modern practices and reality of Chicago culture. I didn't appreciate the references to &#34;Protestant Terrorism&#34; and &#34;Christian hate groups&#34;. I put this series pretty much into the politically correct of the day category.
B002DMJLTE|4.0|Good drarma, with OK acting, special effects were good. I enjoyed this movie, not only for its action, but also the thrill of escape. Very entertaining.
B004LLDN3A|2.0|It is a children's movie after all. I had forgotten what a dumb story it was. By today's standards too much singing and dancing.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Four of us watched this film. I was surprised that I liked a film about glee clubs, but we all were laughing at the humor and enjoying the musical performances which were extremely well done.<br /><br />The plot was predictable, but that did not keep us from having a great time watching the film.
B00009AOBI|5.0|This was such a good movie. The ending made me cry. I have watched it so many times already. I would recommend it to eveyone.<br /><br />Thank you
B009A9BEHU|3.0|I LOVE Coldplay but this is not a great CD, the live music is okay and the DVD has too many special effects added to the live concert portions to make it enjoyable.

B0049IWQJW|2.0|We just watched this show with my 3 year old and she became bored 10 minutes into the show. I was bored too. The storyline seems too serious for kids and too ordinary for adults. Meh.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We chose a five star rating because it was a movie that was enjoyed by both adults and children and that is always great.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Disappointed in the season finale. Could of ended a different way.  Maybe go off to London or overseas but not so tragic.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I would give this book 4.5 stars. I really liked the complexity of the characters and the plot. I loved the male lead. I am excited to read the story from his point of view when the new book comes out in april.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I went into this wanting to like and understand the characters, but I didn't quite get there. The story definitely has potential, but the third dimension of the characters was not quite reached. First, I did not like the names given to the characters. Travis, Shepley, America called Mare and Abby called Pigeon as a pet name from Travis. The author did not provide enough descriptors to really help you envision how the characters looked. Travis' attraction and then obsession with Abby does not make any sense. The fact that she presents a meager challenge is not drawn out enough. The writing lost me at times as I would go back thinking I missed a segue, but it wasn't there. There are some good moments, but it reached a point where I didn't read anymore because I didn't care what happened. I have not given up on this author, though. I will maybe check out some of her other stuff. This particular book just wasn't drawn well enough for me, even though it had the potential to do some interesting things with two seemingly opposites who are essentially exactly alike.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Not sure what mother would do what this one did... I won't spoil the book but I found it really hard to believe being a mother myself. I generally say never say never... but not sure any mother would go where this one did. The one thing this book did do was re-enforce my decision to always check my children's phone, email, and facebook accounts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I rated this book all 5 stars because it is like a action romance mystery and there's a few twist who is hope read to find out what happens to les who is holder just read to find out<br /><br />.<br />.<br /><br />.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This is a story that was a joy to read.  I shall definitely recommend this story.  We should all have experiences that share love like this.
B002RT5SR2|3.0|Overall a pretty good movie.  A bit too much old Hollywood in the many poses for Patricia Neal.  The story is too predictable. But if you like old Hollywood you'll enjoy this movie.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|I really enjoyed this film with the origingal and new characters. I loved the music, especially &#34;muppet of a man&#34; was done so very well. Fun, fun, fun...
B0096HL33G|2.0|The acting was acceptable, but the whole movie was sad and depressing.  I prefer movies that are a bit more uplifting.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is such a beautiful classic. Audrey Hepburn is fabulous. What more can I say. I had to get it on DVD to replace the VHS that was dying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Life carries enough anxiety. Flow is a wonderful game that challenges the mind without tying the Psyche in knots. One of the few games I would happily pay for.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I'm a big Bond fan and I enjoyed the movie.  Javier Bardem was excellent and the plot wasn't bad either.
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|This was recommended to me and I had no idea what I was getting into. Not quite sure if I liked it enough to get season 2
0307352153|5.0|This is a compelling, outstanding book for anyone that would considers themselves an introvert or has a loved one that is introverted and seeks a better understanding.  Ms. Cain explains at the beginning of the book that most people are extroverts (around 60%-70%).  I found this bit of information fascinating and somewhat disheartening.  I have come to suspect over the years that most people are extroverted, yet seeing this fact confirmed was both enlightening and somehow personally frustrating.  The world really is structured to encourage extroversion and rewards people for taking risks and behaving gregariously.  And this can be frustrating and difficult for those of us that are more circumspect and risk-aversive.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Ms. Cain writes: \\"Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling, extroverts to the external life of people and activities.  Introverts focus on the meaning they make of the events swirling around them. Extroverts plunge into the events themselves. \\"  This brief, yet telling statement succinctly describes the two different worlds of introverts and extroverts.  She goes on to say that introverts listen more than they talk, tend to dislike conflict, and prefer deep conversations to small-talk.  Ms. Cain's way of explanation and writing style draws in the reader and compels us to keep reading further.  Perhaps in lesser hands this material could have come across as less than interesting, but Ms. Cain's terrific insights leave us wanting to know more.<br /><br />This book is very well written and fascinating to read.  The author has done a fantastic job researching the subject and explaining how social norms in one country vary greatly from those in another; i.e.: US compared to China.  Reserved behavior and modesty is greatly valued in the East, but not necessarily in Western culture.  Ms. Cain discusses cultural differences as well as the differences in children, and  indications in children as young as 2 or 3 that can accurately predict if the child will grow up to be an extrovert or an introvert.  In this particular study, the children were followed for a number of years (until the late teenage years) and the initial findings that suggested which baby would grow up to be an introvert or extrovert turned out to be correct!  Ms. Cain writes: \\"Temperament refers to inborn, biologically based behavioral and emotional patterns that are observable in infancy and early childhood; personality is the complex brew that emerges after cultural influence and personal experience are thrown into the mix.  Some say that temperament is the foundation, and personality is the building.\\"<br /><br />I think that finding alone is astonishing, as many people probably assume that introversion is something that's purely \\"nurture\\" and does not have biologic components.  To some degree it is both, and upbringing and early childhood experiences no doubt add to the mix, but Ms. Cain's findings offer some very interesting ideas worth further examination.  There is also the finding that introverts tend to be high-reactive individuals, compared to extroverts who tend to be low-reactive, which is why extroverts tend to be more risk-takers.  Having this knowledge about yourself (or your loved one) can be very important in terms  of what jobs are more suitable to introverts and what sort of environment is ideal where introverts can flourish.  Temperament is no small thing and can make a tremendous difference for a child in their formative years and how they will eventually come to view the world as an adult.<br /><br />The most valuable aspect of this book is gaining the insight that while being an introvert may set you apart from the majority of the population; it's absolutely nothing to feel bad about.  As you may have guessed, the author herself is an introvert and describes her own personal struggles on the road to success and how she has dealt with adversity and the sometimes-intimidating situations.  Ms. Cain shares a part of herself with the reader and allows us to embrace that feeling of being somewhat out of the mainstream by letting us know that the status quo is not necessarily the best place for everyone.  There's quiet beauty in being an introvert, and lack of exuberance should not be mistaken for a lack of passion.  As other reviewers have mentioned, many brilliant minds, inventors, scientists, writers, have all been introverts.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone that is an introvert or has a loved one that is (particularly if your child is an introvert or you're in a relationship with an introvert).  The insights gained while reading this book will help you better understand yourself and others.  Unraveling the complexities of personality is no small task, but Ms. Cain manages to clear up some of these mysteries and makes the journey getting there an enjoyable one.ons.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Similar to \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds,\\" Timbaland produces an album for Justin Timberlake that will be enjoyed for many years to come. While most poptart's albums dissolve a year or so after their respective singles fade, this album is sure to stick around and change the current sound of today's chart toppers. While breaking pop's traditional time limits, formulas, and dance beats- Timberlake creates a genre of his own. A genre that is sure to be remembered. The 20/20 Experience is a cohesive album that flows from start to finish, and the outcome is simply timeless.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|a very intricate winding plot makes this a must read. i had difficulty putting this book down in my eagerness to find what was next
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie was excellent. The quality of the download was terrible. Unable to watch it on our t.v. because of garbled sound. Tried starting and stopping it and finally gave up and viewed on an ipad.  Not a good experience with amazon streaming!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Not his best movie, but was good overall, it was crazy when that one guy got dealt with ahh it was crazy...
B000XCZGV8|5.0|This movie has always intrigued me.  I have never owned the movie.  I've only seen it on T.V.  Owning this anniversary DVD was very insightful because it is the director's cut.  They also interview the actual people who are portrayed in this story - from police officers to surviving victims.  It is a great addition to anyone's DVD library.

B0037RDPEG|5.0|I loved every minute of reading this book and did not want it to finish and found myself able to relate to so much of it.  It stayed in my mind for a very long time after I had finished reading it and know it is a book that I will go back to and read again, again and again.  I have also bought and given it to lots of other family members and friends so that they could share my enjoyment.  All of whom have loved it as much as I have.

B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Just listened to the whole cd twice. I respect Justin for trying something different,but different doesn't always mean good. While employing a whole lot of vocal production tricks,this whole cd boils down to lazy songwriting most of the time. Everytime Justin uses his falsetto,he comes across as a wanna be Robin Thicke (who released an excellent cd last year,although it didn't get the recognition it deserved). I feel the music and arrangements could have had much more punch if Justin used REAL drums o the upbeat tracks. Really disappointed that Timbaland didn't deliver better beats fot Justin to sing over. Only 3 of these tracks impressed me at all. Most of the songs ramble on without much melody,just a bunch of bleeps,bloops,and sound effects. I guess i expected too much from the video game generation...smh. C'mon Justin,you can do better!

B003UBTX6S|3.0|The plot was pretty good and even though it is a young adult book, the writing should be at a  higher level.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This was action packed and not as misogynistic as most Bond films. Maybe because there were more women, not just the one he sleeps with.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I know this book has gotten a lot of hype, but it is well deserved.  Beautifully written and touching.  The characters felt real too me.
B0059XTV4Y|3.0|It was better than I expected.  There are so many versions of this story so it was interested to see this interpretation.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|It was campy and fun and dark and creepy and Johnny Depp was all that too!!!<br />I'm hoping that this one will play on my Blu Ray because 3 did not and I don't want to return this one.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dark comedies.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|First of all, this book is very well written.  I can almost imagine how Ms. Condie wrote it - two separate stories written first person from perspective of the 2 main characters, and yet seamlessly interwoven to create one fluid story.  Honestly though, the angst just went up about 5 notches higher than in Matched (and back then, I was writing if off as character development, not angst).  Several pages are devoted to the characters' thoughts and emotions, and that is what multiplied the length of the story by about 3x.  I can't believe how emotional and uncertain the two teens were depicted, both boy and girl.  But then again, I guess that is what makes them believable.  While not as superfluous as Twilight was, the writing style of the author is similar in vein.<br /><br />Summary:  In Matched, the main character, Cassia, was torn between 'a good friend and appointed match' and 'a rebel that she fell in love with'.  The first book ends with Cassia being undecided but leaning towards the rebel.  In Crossed, along with a few other young rebels, Cassia meets up with the underground movement aimed at restoring democracy to their totalitarian government (or so it seems).  Along the way, her uncertainty about her future match is still evident, but again, she is portrayed here as leaning towards the rebel.<br /><br />Open questions - What is the underground movement's vision for society?  Will Cassia and her friends support this vision?  And finally, who will Cassia end up with in this new society?  We will find out more in the third part, \\"Reached\\".<br /><br />I look forward to finishing the entire trilogy.  However, it is my opinion that the entire series could have easily been written as one novel, and it would have sold equally well.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|I hadn't seen this film since it came out, and had forgotten how utterly brutal it is.<br />Unfortunately there is a lot of truth in it, as well.<br /><br />Edward Norton is genious.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Pleasantly surprised  by this album...it's the  one  that  I play  over  and  over....this  guy is the  real  deal; true  artist and musician. Looking  forward  to the  next album  and  hopefully  a  tour  will be  making  it's way  to the Heartland soon ! AWESOME PHIL-PHIL !
B008N1V11U|2.0|game is very good. i just didnt like it because it requires lots of space.all in all not very good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is amazing.  It's unpredictable and action packed.  It can be emotional at times.  I find myself talking to the television in much the same way my girlfriend talks to the tele during her soap operas.  This show is AWESOME! Gawr!
B007SGM084|5.0|It was nice to read a love story that wasn't all romance. To all you lady's out there go have kinky sex! You don't know what your missing!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The best!! We watch this DVD once a month, and enjoy the excellent way that this was recorded and produced.
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book. So much insight and information. Will change the way you eat and look at food.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I got this for my husband for Valentine's Day and even though the movie was open the disc was scratch free.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A real page turner. It's even better because it's a true story. Really inspiring. This is an incredible woman with an incredible story.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I got this for my husband for Valentine's Day and even though the movie was open the disc was scratch free.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The waiting time seems a tad bit long for my taste but the graphics are good and its really fun otherwise.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I go this for my husband for Valentine's day. even though it was open there was no scratches on the disc.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama. And if you can't wait until the next season, the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to get ahead.<br /><br />Check it out.
B0055PMJMW|1.0|Recaps of books I'd previously read.  Terrible description of content - I would not have bought it had I known.
B001G7SS96|3.0|&#34;I Am Legend&#34; fails to adapt the book of the same name to the big screen, but succeeds in so many other ways. I can't give it a perfect score, but I will give it a very hearty recommendation to fans of Will Smith, zombies, vampires, and Bob Marley. Enjoy.
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|Best new band out right now. If you like rock and roll......this is your band. I have been a fan of Jay Buchanan for about 5 years now......great to hear him in a band setting.....his solo material was life changing for me but Rival Sons is just as good!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a predictably unpredictable story of two teenaged star-cross lovers, who also happen to be cancer patients. What makes the novel so good though, is not the plot, intriguing though it is, but the vivacity of the language, which grabs you and pulls you forward ensuring that if you are able to put the book down, it won't be for very long.<br /><br />Although this has been classified as a &#34;young-adult&#34; novel, I would recommend this heart-wrenching story to all readers, the grizzled and gray haired among you included.
0062127241|5.0|I just finished reading Who I Am. I didn't read any other reviews before getting it. Frankly, I really don't understand the reactions of many of the recent reviewers (I didn't go back very far, but most recently they appear to be mostly negative).<br /><br />I was not a HUGE fan of the Who. I didn't follow them closely. I loved their hits, and that's about it. Overall, a positive appreciator but not a manic fanatic. I was STANDING on my SEAT in the third row with my friends when the Who played Tommy in Cleveland in 1970, and I remember that as an excitingly transcendent experience.<br /><br />This book reads to me like an honest self-appraisal. Honestly, I really don't get all the negative comments about self-absorption and drivel and bad editing..... it seems to me that there are some Who fans who have such high expectations, are so attached to what they think they DESERVE to receive from Mr. Townshend, that they can only spew negativity if they don't get exactly what they think they deserve to get from someone who has SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE creating art for the masses.<br /><br />I believe that these particular reviewers are revealing more about themselves than they are about this book. They have built up their own idealized notions (or maybe even not-so-idealized notions) of who Pete Townshend is. Seems that since what he says about himself doesn't match what they think he should be telling them, well, then, it's garbage! He's either TOO revelatory or not revelatory enough. He can't win, can he, with that kind of unrealistic expectation?<br /><br />Someone even wrote that they don't believe that any non-Who fan would enjoy this book at all. Well, I am *almost* a non-Who fan.... as I said, I really loved their hits and that's IT. And I loved reading this book. It is filled with insight.<br /><br />Anyone who has NOT gone through the experience of feeling vague and unsettling \\"possible memories\\" of childhood abuse cannot possibly appreciate the need to \\"revisit\\" andtalk repeatedly about such trauma... at least until it begins to be healed. They cannot possibly understand how insidious such feelings can be and how important it is to look at these feelings from all possible angles. So criticism of Pete for writing repeatedly about these memories is, in my opinion, very cruel and ignorant.<br /><br />Likewise, criticism of Pete being a \\"namedropper.\\" My god, people.... these people were his FRIENDS, his CIRCLE, his COMMUNITY! Of course he is going to be mentioning them frequently!!<br /><br />Badly edited? Well, I'm an editor, and I don't see that at all.<br /><br />Not enough detail? YOU try writing about your entire life sometime! (Really shaking my head on this one -- just what do some of you WANT from the guy???)<br /><br />My \\"favorite\\" criticism is the one that says Townshend's autobiography reveals him to be \\"self-absorbed.\\" This is another head-shaker. I'd like to know how it is possible to write about one's life and NOT appear to have the Self as the primary focus. Not only does Pete frequently express concern and gratitude for MANY of the people who have moved through his life, but he often tells us what these feelings were at the time, while he was living it, not just in retrospect. This is a man who has interacted with and loved many people. \\"Self-absorbed\\" is a pointless and worthless criticism. Don't pay attention to any reviewer who makes this claim!<br /><br />Someone else commented that it was the same-old same-old..... rock star does too much drugs and sex and finds redemption in the end, so... BORING. Well, has it occurred to you that this happens so frequently precisely because it is an altogether understandable human pattern for so many, many reasons? And that each individual human needs to go through exactly what they go through? And that each individual human is precious and is entitled to experience what they are here to experience.... and then WRITE ABOUT IT if that's part of the experience?? It mattersnot one iota if it's a \\"predictable\\" pattern or not. What matters is how each individual gets through it and overcomes it. THAT'S the story that Pete tells, and I feel he tells it quite compellingly.<br /><br />Quite honestly, I didn't want this book to end. I wanted Pete to keep telling me about his life. While I'm not a person who would have enjoyed being in his life during all those troubled, addicted, adulturous years, I do appreciate an honest telling of a deeply examined life. I do applaud his struggle to what appears to be a \\"happy ending.\\"<br /><br />I do think that he kind of rushes through his later years, spending much more time on the earlier years. If I HAD to come up with a criticism, I would say that I'd perhaps like a little more detail about the last 10 years.<br /><br />But that's it. In my opinion, if you want to read a GREAT autobiography, read Who I Am. It's Pete talking honestly about Pete. Who else can possibly criticize the way in which he has done that??? It's HIS life as HE sees it. I am very grateful that he felt dedicated enough to his own life and his own processes to create a proper rendering of it in book form. And I appreciate his great vulnerability in opening himself up to what I consider to be harsh and pointless criticism. I am quite grateful to have had the opportunity to read Pete's own words about his life.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|I came to this after tearing through the Dresden Files and wanting more. It's well-written, and an interesting world. Hearne has clearly done a lot of research on the various mythologies that form the setting, and I quite enjoyed that part.<br /><br />The one thing I felt it was lacking was character development. I wasn't able to identify with or even particularly get to know any of the characters. Up until the finale, the main character doesn't even come up against anything that particularly challenges him.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great for passing the time and challenging friends for the highest scores.  Graphics are decent and gameplay is easy for anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! The ending was superb & completely unexpected. Although I didn't it to end! Now I've gotta see the movie!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The movie is a great in its own right. Many people complain that it was more kiddish, less epic, and the story wasn't as engaging as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This is true but the Hobbit was a different type of book (geared more towards kids). The Hobbit was an epic story and the visuals and locations with-in the movie are a treasure just to look at. Anyways the movie did a great job of portraying the book and I think all should buy!
0807014273|5.0|This one was a recommendation from my daughtrer. What a book! I would make it required reading in high school. The story of courage and survival and the psychology, sociology of that experience has relevance for all who seek meaning in life.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Two of my favorite stars do a wonderful job in a classic story. I had to own a copy for myself.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|I did not enjoy this book. I didn't like any of the characters nor did I enjoy the story. I don't know... maybe I missed something but the only reason I finished is because it was our book club selection.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Incredible, very down to earth book written by a true American Hero. Easy book to read, and it makes it easier to understand the miltary way of life.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding account of the background and details of first hand account of the day Osama Bin Laden was found and killed.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I liked the movie but i don't think it would have made much sense unless you had read the book.
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|The gameplay is great. It's like a very difficult arcade game. A typical game lasts under 60 seconds (in fact, probably closer to under 10 seconds).<br /><br />My only complaint is the sparse options available to the user. There are no replays, no rewind, no invincibility option, and no mode in which the camera does not rotate.<br /><br />The creator's last game, VVVVVV, was very good in the amount of options it had. You could disable camera effects and enable invincibility in that game. It also had a slowdown option, for less-skilled or physically able players.<br /><br />Still, buy the game. You will feel awesome with every second by which you improve your score. Thrilling techno music accompanies the game, and the dizzying (in a good way!) camera and pulsating hexagons all create a really cool atmosphere. Super Hexagon is hard, but with hard work, you can beat it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and it was one of those books you don't want to end. The story was compelling and the characters were interesting and you could feel the emotions.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Wow..wow...wow...did i say wow?...The Timbaland/Timberlake combo will forever work.....The R&B jams are at there finest....Spaceship Coupe, Strawberry Bubblegum, That Girl....etc...etc....look, i can name atleast 5 hot tracks and 2 alright tracks...its only 10/12!!!!...On heavy rotation in my ride....JTs matured and this \\"ride\\" is fantastic.......Im back....3/22/2012.....Ive discovered the more i listen to this cd., tracks that i didnt care much for originally has grown on me...Mirrors for one(the last 3 minutes or so is just beautiful)...Let the Groove in(takes a turn towards the middle/end..again.,magnificent)....Loved Strawberry Bubblegum right off the back but once again its nice how it switches gears., so many multiple layers to each song(7 minutes are hardly noticeable)...Thats what artistry and good music is all about...A true EARGASM.....You must give this cd continuous \\"playover\\" to really embrace it completely...Its even better than i originally thought...Thanks JT!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book.  It was an easy and enjoyable book different from so many books today that they are so deep one can't get into the book.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. You will not be disappointed if you have a heart. I loaned my first copy to a friend and never got it back. I hope who ever has it is enjoying it.
B005XLN77O|2.0|I was really disappointed when receiving this product. The package had been opened and roughly sealed by some plastic tapes. It's supposed to be a gift for my niece. I was expecting it shiny and adorable but ended up getting this cheap-looking package.
1439156816|5.0|I used this book in my first college writing class. It has been very helpful and I would highly reccommend it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I can see why it is offered as a &#34;quick start&#34; to Kindle's page on self-publishing. The section on preparing the text for submission could have been more detailed, but the book did give reference points on the more complex areas. Again--- a must read for those taking the self-publication route.
0205313426|4.0|I like to keep this next to my desk when I am writing or working on papers. It is very helpful. The teenage grandchildren use it if they are here doing their homework. A must have.
B007N85POS|2.0|Thought that this would be entertaining but I have yet to get it..Maybe I need a lesson!!! Will ask a friend to show me how to play
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app is very addicting!  I easily lose track of time pinning and re-pinning.  The only problem (and for me it's a big one) is that the app force closes constantly.  Very irritating!  If they fix this for the Kindle Fire then this will be 5 star worthy for sure.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have always loved this game. It's a fun and challenging game. It will be around forever. Now I can take it with me.
B009A87X80|5.0|Wonderful, beautiful and so very very sweet... i enjoy her lovely voice. A tremendous loss. One of a kind... she is missed.
0920668372|5.0|My daughter was given a baby shower and everyone had to bring a children's book for the new baby.  Out of 25 guests, 5 people got her this book! Very popular!<br />I am the new Grandma and decided to keep this at my home.  It was a definite favorite of my own kids growing up!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|the only one i enjoyed was the first book. not my style. too much if the same over and over.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|This is a cheesy movie, but great if you don't want to have to be involved in following a plot, etc.  You know the end of the movie as soon as it starts but sometimes that's the kind of movie you want to watch.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|very very repetitious, certain words were used over and over again, like the writer has a limited vocabulary, although she seemed to have a great sexual  fantasy. i enjoyed the first book, two and three, not.  am not crazy to recommend to my friends.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|I really looked forward to seeing this movie. I have been a fan of Lord of the Rings for forty years, however, this movie's sound quality is poor. I tried it with my speakers,which will blow you out of the room on other movies and music, and could still barely hear the lines. I tried headphones and my computer speakers were up at 100%. Since there is no refund on Amazon instant video purchases I can only warn others not to buy this instant video. Buy the DVD, at least you can return that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i liked this one in the beginning, but the next two were boring and too much of the same. i was happy to have finished reading these. i finished because i was curious to see how this insecure girl played out.
B008PZYZH6|5.0|It  was not predictable as most action movies are.  It was interesting and fun movie.  Hope there's more movies like this.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|We did not enjoy this movie at all. We barely made it through to the end. Very boring and just dragged on and on. We usually like Denzel Washington movies, but this one was just not good.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Another great product from the band Bon Jovi. They continue to offer relevant music to their fans, both the old faithful and the newcomers. Everyone will enjoy this rockin' album! In addition, the interactive album cover is absolutely amazing.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I haven't watched it in 3D yet maybe that will make it more enjoyable this is nothing like the Lord of the Rings. The only thing that I can say positive is the sound that comes through my onkyo Tx-nr 818 was amazing.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game.  My kids introduced me to it.  It can be a great way to get rid of your frustrations.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game surprised me. I like that the goal is to get 3 stars each round. This is a fun competition with myself. If you need a few hours to fill, this is the app for you!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I love Pac-Man.  It was one of my favorite childhood games.  I'm not that good at it, but it's fun to play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this App.  It has many great features such as the highlighting feature, notes and reminders.  I love the reading plans you have to choose from.  It helps me stay on track.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I had never played this before, but my youngest son  introduced me to it.  It's a fun game that tests your strategies, and even your memory if you're trying to duplicate your move.  Can even test your knowledge of physics.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love to shop, and I love eBay.  You can find almost anything you are looking for on it.  You just have to be careful not to spend too much time or money on the site.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|The only action was at the end. It was the weakest Bond ever....seemed old and no game with the ladies. Rather boring for the first two hours. Felt like I was watching a cheap knockoff of a Rocky movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook.  I love the fact that you can keep up with your family, friends, co-workers no matter where they live.  I now keep in touch with friends from my childhood in Mass,. family in Georgia, friends iwho are missionaries in Hungary, and many more.  It's just amazing!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I an addicted to this game. There are different ways to play and the colors are amazing. I can't get enough.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This is a neat game, but I guess I was late getting on board.  The people I knew who used to play it don't anymore, and I haven't found anyone else to join me.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|this turned out as well as I expected it to. funny, and had a sort of moral for kids to maybe pick up on. very entertaining.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love to play Mahjong.  I was addicted as soon as I started playing it.  I can easly spend time playing it.  It's fun and a good escape for me.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|A racy entertainer that does not slow down even momentarily.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt proves his versatility in handling varied characters yet again.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love to play Spider solitaire.  It can be challenging at times, but it is fun.  Great to do to pass the time.
B006O6FK2W|4.0|This product feels extremely solid and the gliding Batman eject is awesome :)<br /><br />Ensure that you spring up the lever at the bottom every time you place the action figure in the cockpit area.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|Great wind up to an already wonderful series. I am so glad I bought it on Amazon.  And the quality of the downloaded video was excellent too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice to have accurate local weather conditions and my fingertips without searching.  Well worth the down load.  Thank you Accuweather.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I was raised a Christian and participated heavily in the church.  The older I got and the more I studied, I realized that everything I was taught about a god just didn't make sense.  I finally got a copy of the God Delusion and it solidified my stance that the chance of a god existing is almost nill.  Richard Dawkins is brilliant, concise and thorough in his argument against the existence of god.  I passed this book along to my children who will then pass it along to their children.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's fun and you can do a lot of things. I like being able to breed different dragons. The only thing that is not that good is how you earn the gold bars.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  The graphics are really nice and easy on the eyes.  I would recommend. this game if you are looking for something that will keep your interest and not cost you money to have fun.
B001R1PZ9M|3.0|Fun to watch and full of nostalgia. I remember loving this movie as a child, but being an adult now, I am able  to see its flaws with regards to plot and character development, and it doesn't hold up to the previous two films. But overall, still fun to watch.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Funny, heartwarming, even serious at times.  My kind of movie!  Ford and McAdams play well opposite one another, and seem so genuine.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is TV at its finest!  The characters are magnificently portrayed, and the storyline absolutely grabs your attention immediately.  I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment.  I adore this series!!!
076790592X|5.0|Read this book after reading &#34;Have a Little Faith&#34;.  Albom does a marvelous job conveying the struggles that men, young or old, have with the deep and the simple questions of life.  This book, Tuesdays, is a heartwarming story as well.  Albom has made the transition from sports writer to contemplative writer admirably.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Less ADD than the last one, good script. Action appropriate not over the top. Stunts were good, acting was good.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Picks up right where Magician's Nephew leaves off.  This series is excellent for any particulary inquisitive young person, boy or girl.  It will rank highly among the first gifts I'll give to grandchildren!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a little sad but I'm happy she chose Peeta. It's is my second favorite series I have ever read :)
B006IDG2T6|4.0|Say what &#34;you will&#34; about Harris, but he is an excellent writer.  I don't agree with him on some things, and I do agree with him on others.  His other books, &#34;Landscape&#34; and &#34;Letter&#34; are similar to this one in that he is not at all shy about saying what he believes.  Of course, who &#34;he&#34; is, and exactly what &#34;belief&#34; is, remain a bit of a mystery.
B00BQUUH7E|4.0|This game is very fun! I have a four star rating on this because this game says it has multiplayer but I don't see it anywhere in the game...
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Got this as on the 19th as promised...in perfect condition. I already watched it and it was everything I hoped it would be. Thanks, People. You rock!
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|When I got it it was good but I realised you can't save photos and it only points towards you and in that case it shows EVERYTHING the smallest hair on your shirt not to good of a app.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Pure romance! Wonderful to listen to and even better to dance with the one you love to!! This is one of the CDs we make sure to take along on trips!
B0074VA2T2|5.0|I have 3 boys and they love my kindle fire so I'm always trying to get educational games for them, this was great! But they didn't want to play it after an hour or so (what can you expect their boys?!) LOL but it's a good game overall I read the &quot;Hungry Caterpillar&quot; growing up so when I saw it I was in love! It's a good app for kids!
B003JTHESA|4.0|I miss a little the years of The Number of The Beast or Powerslave but The final Frontier is a good CD anyway.<br />Maiden never let us down!<br />\m/
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this game.  So awesome --  i love that you can use your imagination and build things, and its so fun
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Really enjoyed Nightmare and it has slowly became my favourite Avenged Sev.'s CD and one of the greatest CDs of the millenium!<br />Thanks
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Fantastic character development that weaves a compelling story across the series and engaging new plots each episode.  I am hooked.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|very fun and atmospheric. I find it relaxing and stimulating. the story is engaging and music catchy. game play is mechanically unrelated to the game however you find yourself caught up in the plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great read. Kept me on the edge of what will happen next. Very unique story line that tugged at my heart every minute that I read each page of this amazing book.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game. Keeps me busy when I'm slow its easy to play and not that hard to pop<br />Pick up.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Saw the movie twice and just had to read the book.  Such an amazing imagination and getting it all together in an unforgettable story.
0525953728|4.0|This book by Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer is very well written and manages to keep the reader's attention. At least, they certainly did keep MY attention. Yes, this is an account of the mission that killed Bin Laden. It strikes me as being factual and accurate in that respect, unlike the rubbish that was put out by the government and the mainstream media. The former SEAL who wrote this took a lot of flak from the military establishment as a result, and I am pleased he had the guts to tell the tale.<br /><br />Of interest to me is that he wrote about the training and about other operations he had been involved in. He portrayed the people he worked with, and himself, as being very human and flawed. He owned up to his fears and his mistakes. It is, however, very telling when he speaks of how they now have to operate in Afghanistan with essentially one hand tied behind their back.<br /><br />This book really made me think. I recommend it.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I appreciated that as an Amazon Prime member I could watch this for free. It was a solid movie. Good for a Saturday afternoon maybe. The book was very good and I'm glad I read it first.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I am a homeland junky, I can't phrase it much different than that.  I watched the season on TV and now I would like to own the season and all the future seasons.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Pages are miss-sized so you can only see part of the rightmost column. Iow you cannot read the second temperature digit. Hard to see, confusing with lots of uneeded information and no way to get rid of it. All in all its just too cute. Got to find a different weather app, this one is history!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I has seen Chris on TV when the book 1st came out and I was so impressed with how down to earth he was.  I purchased the book after he was killed while helping others.  I have a new respect  for our troops and how they risk their lives every day to keep us safe.  Everyone man/woman should read this.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Of course this is a go to series when people ask for something to watch. Drama, comedy,action are all here. The world these 9 actors live in is a wonderful if not dark world where life is as simple as just keep flyin and as complected as figuring out what River is talking about. You will like this if you give it a try or unless you run Fox.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game would be fun, if it didn't crash constantly. it's pretty much unplayable in its current state. thanks anyway.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|My granddaughters absolutely love this movie!!! They are 5 & 7!!! Such a cute storyline and item was shipped fast!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As for the season, it was show and not like the other seasons plus they got rid of one of the main peaple being his wife that I hated but I guess if that would happen for real. It would be the same O well
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|Gothic horror at it's best, a must read for any horror fan just to realize the influence this book has had on so many contemporary authors
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Action packed and full of drama, season two was worth the wait. Unlike season one, it steers away from the book a little bit and it leaves out a couple of characters.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'M USING MY DADS ACCOUNT so that's why the name is &quot;justadad&quot; Dragonvale is by far my favorite game on my tablet. I've been playing this app for over a year now :)<br />PROS~&middot; This game isn't too hard to learn how to play<br /> &middot;Dragonvale  has soothing music to listen to<br />&middot; Adorable dragons, my favorite is my platinum Dragon.<br />&middot; No issues,  so far I've personally never had any issues with this app<br />&middot; Fast, Dragonvale is slow at loading when you play for the first time but every time after that it loads really fast<br />CONS~ &middot;Facebook, it is possible to loose your park if your not logged in with Facebook, but I'm not logged and I've never lost my park<br />&middot;Time , almost everything takes at least 2 days to complete and the only way to speed it up is with diamonds<br />&middot; Diamonds, there is a way to win diamonds but you mostly have to buy them<br />CONCLUSION~ all in all I would recommend this app to everyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great story of the seals, it is a book you do not to put down Until you are finished reading it
B002N9MK8G|5.0|Sinatra Live at the Sands is a classic.  Count Basie's band sounds great backing him up and Sinatra had never sounded better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVED the ENDING, I'm so glad that Katniss came to her senses and realized that it was Peera she loved all along.<br />I was very disappointed that Finnik sacrificed himself to the Mutts.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this game nearly everyday. It's strategical, yet not too difficult. It's got great graphics and the entire story is really cool
B001UGB1X8|2.0|It might have been an okay movie but would not play. It stopped about 4 times  and reloaded from the beginning so I had to forward it, after the 4th time enough was enough! Why is it that the movies that you pay for are great, but the freebies don't always work out and often don't play?
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Jodi is one of my favourite authours very easy to read and as always a great story line. Highly recommend it to anyone
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very entertaining and the kids really like that it is a character that they like.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00AM2UXFI|5.0|I have used this invaluable reference since college.  Bridgman breaks down each part of the human anatomy into easily graspable forms and shows their range of motion.  Any book of his on Life Drawing is golden.
0425263908|5.0|A Great Read, similar again to Fifty Shades but has it's own taste!! I ordered the trilogy for this one too and can't wait to get into more of the story!!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Having jumped in during the third season,  getting the first and the second seasons from amazon helped complete the circle
034580404X|5.0|I was very hesitant in buying these books until my daughter bought and read them and let me borrow hers. I just had to own my own set once I read them!!! It is a fascinating love story!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know these books are popular but put off reading them for fear of getting caught up in the hype. I wish it wouldn't have taken do long! It has been a long time since I literally could not put a book down, but this did it for me. I'm eager to start the next one immediately
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game it is simple and engaging. It passes the time. It entertains all ages. Myself and my 7 year old.
0071762345|4.0|Likeable Social Media is a great read for creating an online brand that is very \\"likeable.\\" The author is able to present concise ideas in a way that is easy for readers to read, without wasting time. Through the use of many really life examples as well as thought challenging questions to bring the ideas to real life for your brand. The ideas in this book are not complicated and really boil down to one point, treat others how you want to be treated, and you will be \\"likeable\\" online. The author truly makes it easy for companies to begin or strengthen their online brand to better communicate with current and potential consumers as well as the sometimes forgotten employee. All of these are a key cog to success, and with social media becoming the way of modern marketing, it is imperative that each feels comfortable to approach you through social media and finds you likeable. Likeable Social Media clearly outlines these steps to appease each cog, and truly become a great online brand.<br /><br />This simple read is great for developing a social media presence. The only drawback though, is that this book really focuses on brands that are already developed, and not so much starting out. This book is something that can be kept around for often use as a point of regular reference.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hai I'm Samantha I'm 20 going to be 21 on the 22 or March add me people<br /><br />  Kik: babygirl2351 add me (:
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book I think it is the best so far out of all the Percy Jackson series I rated it a five because it has a little bit of everything humor,action,romance, and will keep you on your toes also if your a fan of old stories about gods and monsters you should read the Percy Jackson series and I know you will love it just like me👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so much fun, I never thought playing a hungry lethal shark could be so much fun!! It's so fun, maybe a little too violent for the little ones. A really fun gane
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a series much like Firefly.  Fictional morality play.  Good story line, characters, writing...and continuity.  Having collection allows cross reference.
B0044IABFS|3.0|Season 1 and 2 were fantastic...Season 4 was worth watching to see some closure, but there is a reason the series ended.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Got here quick. Best price around. Packaging and quality were brand new. My husband and I love watching this show together.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A book about a terrible decrease which almost always ends badly. Yet this book is about teenagers who happen to have cancer, but are regular teenagers. Sad topic, not a sad story. Gives perspective.
B0039NK0LE|3.0|I wanted to watch this movie again the other night with a friend and I was pretty disappointed to have paid money for resolution that looked bad on a small 21' computer monitor<br /><br />Pros:<br />Funny movie<br /><br />Cons:<br />The resolution's comparable to people who record movies in theaters.... in other words, terrible.
B004GYY714|5.0|It can take everywhere and anywhere with excellent menu driven choices.  Very logical and a bargain at even twice the cost of the application.  I have recommended to many relatives and close friends.  Android, Windows or iOS doesn't matter they all work great.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|I loved this TV series back in the 80's/90's.  Glad to watch it again !!!  Season 2 was even better!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Since it was announced that The Hobbit would be made into a trilogy of films, the negative criticisms and excoriation have hardly ceased. I will not address that whole aspect of the chatter about this film because I believe it is both incorrect and inappropriate. Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings sought to take a humongous novel and reduce it to three three-hour films (+/-). To the extent that Jackson's accomplishment, visually, is stunning and an unrivaled technical marvel is, by now, beyond question. However, given that Tolkein's accomplishment is primarily linguistic in nature, Jackson and his writers chose to chop most of that language out of the book, and substitute a grand sequence of visual set pieces. For all my admiration of the visual accomplishment, it has always bothered me significantly that in replacing Tolkein's language with an endless series of dialogue fragments that the whole point of the work was essentially lost - or disfigured beyond recognition. One marvels at the technical accomplishment - but at the same time, becomes weary and shell shocked at the unending, relentless battles, blood-and-guts gore almost exactly as Howard Shore's wall-to-wall score creates unforgivable aural fatigue.<br /><br />I say all this to point now to Jackson's rendition of The Hobbit. Here, Tolkein's exquisite detail has been given the time to be presented much more completely - and when, for example, one comes to the riddle scene, it is very rewarding to see it presented in full sentences, and without simplistic textual redactions. Howard Shore's score is, regrettably, still wall-to-wall - and very annoying at that, and for the same reasons as above.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, as a film, seems to me just about right in all its aspects - especially when compared to the reductio-ad-absurdam of Jackson's LOTR trilogy, even its its \\"extended\\" versions. The argument that the original novel was a slim, short work, and that Jackson's adaptation is far too dark is absurd on its face. There is plenty of humor here - but the truth is that many of the episodes in the book which Tolkein describes only in general terms (and which would be fleshed out later in LOTR) are given the full, forward looking treatment - and deservedly so. By incorporating other, directly relevant materials from the rest of the LOTR cycle, Jackson has taken Tolkein's \\"sketch\\" and fleshed it out. It is altogether a satisfying rendition of the novel - whose 163 minutes fly by rather quickly. I'm eager to see the next installment, and rather expect that it will maintain the same high standard.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|A somewhat lacking follow-up to &#34;Storm of Swords.&#34; In this installment, Martin changes many of his conventions, narrates from the perspective of secondary characters, and fails to connect us readers to the characters in the way he had in the three prior books. If you're anything like me, you will read this book with the understanding that it's a necessary stage-setting novel for the series to (hopefully) go out with a bang in the next 3 (or so) novels.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Is a good book was on list of best sellers. Well written and keeps you interested to the end of the book
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Perhaps my imagination doesn't have the same delivery as Peter Dinkelage, Sean Bean, and Mark Addy, but this is one time when I might be a bigger fan of the television show than of the book. However, that is more of a compliment to the show than a knock on the book. I loved the characters and plot, but Martin's prose is far from the best I've read. His language and dialogue ranges between archaic and modern quite sporadically. You'll be hooked and insist on finishing the entire series once you're done with this book, but Martin could have benefited from a team of HBO writers' collaborating on the novel itself.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Was very confusing in the beginning of the book and took a while to get into it, but once it got going was good
B000FBFN1U|4.0|If I could give half stars, this would be getting a 4.5 rating. Unlike the other books in Martin's series, this is full of pivotal moments. It follows different story arcs with our favorite characters and thrills with 4 or 5 separate climaxes. Characters introduced in previous books are revealed as much greater pieces and become new favorites. Overall, It is the best that I've read so far. (I haven't read all of &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34; and there are still installments to be written.) Martin's language and narration is still less than stellar, but he manages to create such a riveting story this time that I don't mind as much.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show. Video and audio clear on my iPad. Made my prime membership worthwhile. I am ready for the next season.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|All your favorite (living) characters return, and this book holds up as a sequel to &#34;A Game of Thrones.&#34; Martin continues to add depth to the old point-of-view characters, who barely had a chance to show themselves in the first novel. The addition of new narrators adds to the already fascinating story. Aside from this book being 90% climbing action, it is a very enjoyable read.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|On the day I received this item, it worked great.  It was difficult to get into the lighter slot in my car, but once it was in, it worked fine...for one day.  On day two, this item completely died -- and my iphone5 gave me a message that the device was \\"not compatable\\" with iphone 5.  Total disappointment.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|I kept hearing a couple songs on Sirius from this album that I really liked, so I went & bought it. What a GREAT album.. the whole thing! Good 'Ol Rock n Roll!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I don't play games much. But I like the challanges it provides. If I get frustrated I can go from season to season.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|It is a fun movie, great for relaxing on the couch with your family and forgetting the troubles of the grown-up world.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Was an extremely well written book, had a little bit of everything for everyone.  It was one of those books that moves you in many different ways.  Very pleased with purchase
6305754969|5.0|Great! Enjoyed the DVD. Watched it on the flat-screen giving it my full attention then I watched it several times in the background as I am multitasking.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have always enjoyed Spark's stories, but they seem to be pretty predictable.  Safe Haven was no different.  It was an easy<br />read with no real thinking going on as I read.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I had heard good things about this movie and they were right.  This movie had great visuals with the right mix of humor for both kids and adults while still creating touching moments.
B00632HWOG|2.0|This app symbol appears on my cell phone after trying numerous attempts to get my cell phone's email to come up. I haven't been able to receive emails on my cell since Jan. 30th! -Don't know why I can't get in when I can on my laptop and I even checked with cell phone provider. A huge inconvenience!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Pretty fun time killer.  Graphics are pretty cool especially when the shark thrashes around on the beach or when it is eating.  The &#34;air&#34; super slot-mo is awesome.  If you can get enough boost you can leap high enough into the air to catch a para-glider or leap onto an island and thrash around until you fall back int the ocean on the other side.  Check it out!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Love it this game is very simple but also fun.The levels are fun to play over and over never boring.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie does a great job of giving background as to how Western nations actually caused many of the problems in Iran. John Goodman and Alan Larkin are superb in their roles as Hollywood insiders. Ben Affleck's character rings true as the CIA agent committed to his rescue mission.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This movie has such great music! Frank and Ollie did a great job making the songs unforgettable. I love the lullaby song he sings to the children best. Although Toot Sweets gets stuck in your head for years!
B0077PHNWO|5.0|This is a great album!  It's a cross between Siouxie and the Banshees and the Cranberries with the kick of wanting to hear it again and again....Purchase it....you won't be disappointed!!
B0047685I2|4.0|This is one of my favorites but I really wish they could come up with some special features for the blu-ray. Having a boring main menu and being able to watch the original theatrical trailer just does not do it for me.
B004OC07GM|5.0|It is one of the best business book i ve ever read. I really recomend Thia book for everyone who is interesses In innovation and Technology.
B0095P31L6|5.0|My kids love this movie as do I, as a parent.  This is a movie that we have watched over and over again.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I own every one of the soundtracks to the movies. I like this one the best. It has a good mixture of update and ballads, plus it has artists I've actually heard of! Big plus!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome. Way better than temple run, and you can compete against your facebook friends. Best mobile game ever
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This product seems to work pretty well. However I have not had much opportunity at the moment to dive in and discover the nuances of the program to familiarize myself with the program as of yet. Though I'm having some difficulty trying to personalize the file system. Also I have experienced some document transitions when I move an Word Doc from my PC to my Kindle. I have lost some parts of my document that were just missing... and surprisingly they have been in the middle of a document. I'm not sure why this is happening. So... thus far it's just ok.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it could be better but basicly its the coolest game ever!!  I love the graphics. I could play it all night long.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Normally I play puzzle type games. Cosmos is a thinking man's action game. Can not wait to get to the next level.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Graphics are good. I hit a wall early on and unless I log into the game several times an hour, the game play to coins earned ratio is less than good. Still, if you have nothing better to do and love dinosaurs, it's a good game.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The Martian is a very well written and entertaining story. The ONLY complaint I have is that it should have been proof read better or more. There are some grammatical errors and several misspelled words. Other than that, brilliant!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I am not sure how he continues to create scenarios that have so many threads around topics that we do think about.  Clearly, Asian agression is one of those topics, and he was masterful in creating an exciting plot.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I asked my son what he wanted for Christmas. He said, &#34;The Shield.&#34;  Done. We've been fans of this series for years and are very happy to own it.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I enjoy this film with a compassionate and angst ridden male anti-hero who becomes hero. I enjoyed the inside jokes like the or-re-ohs (no spoilers) and my grandson loved pointing out the multiple references to older video games. Both my grandson, and granddaughter loved this film.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|It is by now well-known that Mr. Locke bought a ton of reviews from a company. And he did other things to boost his chances that he left completely out of the book. For example, he wrote books specifically for categories with very few competitors. He also did his homework with very specific keywords and studied the ins and outs of the Amazon environment. NONE of the stuff that he mentions in the book helped to catapult him to the stratosphere. It's what he kept you in the dark about that helped him.
B0079J28NC|5.0|Llistening to this CD lifts your spirits.  I also like the movie, but when I'm busy with other things, the music lightens your mood.  I recommend this highly but expect most people already have it.  We hosted Chinese students who really enjoyed the movie and the music, too.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot. It is fun and all ages will love it! It runs smoothly on a Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD, yet it would be nice to have some bug fixes but other than that it is great! Please update to keep this app in the tops and to enhance my game play.<br />  -Your awesome reviewer Will Mc
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love this game the minute I played it and it is very time consuming and that is what I need for moments alone
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This looked like a great version of snow white however upon seeing it i must admit i was greatly disappointed. If the movies would just take all the efforts from making all the different versions and put it all into one spectacular version that would be great. So of course that will never happen.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it's like the games I played as a teenager.  I had the free version of this & used that for about a year, but the paid version has more games and no ads.  I play on my Kindle Fire. The ads didn't really bother me, but I am enjoying the Brix Arcade game and the Space Frontier that come with the Premium version.  If you like playing actual pinball machines, this is a good alternative.  I use it when I'm waiting for the bus to come or I have to wait for an appointment.  Good to pass the time with.  AND you can pause the game & come back to it when you have the time again.  I love trying to beat my high score.  You should try it.
B005LAII0I|4.0|This is not my favorite version of snow white however it is still entertaining to watch. With all the famed reveiws from it i was hoping for a bit more from this movie.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Defending a King His Life & Legacy is a book which tells the truth about the life of Michael Jackson. It will take you on a emotional roller-coaster ride.

Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy
0792164903|5.0|One of my favorite movies. The costume designer out did themselves in this movie. Wonderful mastery of the story of sleepy hallow.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Took me a little bit to get in the rhythm but once I got it I love it. Every puzzle is a little bit different to keep it interesting but not so hard to make it frustrating. And it's. free!!!!!
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|Can't figure out this game.  Hate when I get these games and no instructions plus I'm not a youngster anymore and need more help playing these games so my grandson can play them.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My wife has the habit of buying inexpensive knives and replacing them with other inexpensive knives.  So we end up with a drawer full of knives that can't cut pancakes never mind a tomato.<br /><br />I saw this little bugger and I couldn't resist.  Now it did not transform the crap-o-matic knives into chef-tastic tools, but it does make them SHARP.  Amazingly so and Amazingly fast.  Three passes through and I am slicing tomato's like... tomato's.  Thin and delicious.  Dicing garlic and onion and carrots like a slap-o-matic and nearly performing unexpected surgery when I forgot how sharp they now were.  Had to get them out of the drawer and into a knife rack to avoid unintentional cuts.<br /><br />For the money this is a no-brainer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game has me hooked. I love playing it. It is very addictive. I am glad I am not at a real machine like this playing,  I would really be broke.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I think you would too. You should read it and then enjoy the excellent movie adaptation.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Awesome Epic Journey into Spirituality and Academy Award Recommended. I was astounded and impressed by Director Ang Lee and his Actor Suraj Sharma and entire Academy Award winning crew on the power of prayer. I was astounded How Epicly Amazing it truly was a heart moving expeirnece and forwardwith the human spirit to survive with spritual reasoning.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is waaay different from what he has put out in the past...I think it is a great CD...I recommend it to everyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really interesting episodes about WWI, great drama, good character development. Looking forward to watching season 3 (again) and season 4!! Love Downton Abbey!!!!
B00BMVTTJ4|3.0|until you reach the end. I don't like movies were they are expecting a sequel and they just leave you hanging.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game just continues to get better and better.The whole family loves it.It is especially enjoyed by my grandchildren.Great A+
B005723JSQ|3.0|Easy read, but pretty predictable. Typical Sophie novel, however not my favorite book of hers and I've pretty much liked everything she has written
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|This was a beautiful display of art -  the costumes, the movement of bodies in form of play and theatre, I loved the passion and each character was pristine. A story that will never fade of pure love and obsession and the consequences of those choices.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|While not as glitzy as some Bond movies, this movie's plot and action make it (in my opinion) the best Bond movie yet.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this read a lot. It was interesting to see how much a person can and will do against all odds to survive a situation that should not have been surviveable.<br />Truly an interesting take on an astronauts training and skill.
B009K2SLYG|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail broke new comedic ground in the 1970's.  IMDB provides plot information and I won't reproduce that here.  This has the entire original Monty Python company (a lot of them are gone).  All are excellent.  The plot is quite funny, and the sight gags are about as good as it gets.<br /><br />An incredible amount of contemporary humor comes from this classic.  A must see.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|Enjoyed the different chapters on creativity, intelligence, education, and so on.<br />I also learned about many important people around the world that have contributed deeply by giving thru their extraordinary work.<br />I highly recommend.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Any fan of Tolkien should love this movie.  It's been so long since I read 'The Hobbit' (1967 when I read it) that I can't attest that this follows the story line closely.  This is obviously part one with part two to follow.  The first 10-15 minutes are a little slow, but even so, enjoyable.  The action scenes are very well done, the characters are engaging and credible, and as before the mix of large characters to small characters is pulled off seamlessly (even better than in the trilogy).<br /><br />As before, the CGI effects are stellar.  The underground realm of the dwarves is awesome.  I don't use that description often.<br /><br />I am glad I bought this movie, as I intend to watch it repeatedly until I can absorb the vast details of every beautiful scene.  I initially watched it in 2D to enjoy the story, then watched in 3D to get the effects.  The 3D was done tastefully, with no obvious 3D 'wow-me' gimmicks.<br /><br />A must see for any Tolkien Middle Earth Fan.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Very reminiscent of X-Files with a different twist.  It has a good cast and is enjoyable to watch.  Recommended for the true Sci-Fi fan.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I enjoyed the original Judge Dredd, but this version is more engaging with a plot that has enough intrigue to provide interest, but not overwhelm the story as in the first 'Dredd'.  IMDB has an excellent plot review.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|This CD is extremely good.  Her voice is just perfect.  Whitney will always be the greatest singer of all time.
B00BHMF578|5.0|A wonderfully crafted and directed movie that uses actual scenes from the real event at the end to illustrate how close to true they made this gem.  The only concession to Hollywood was the suspense built near the end (I won't reveal the plot).<br /><br />This is one of the few movies I've watched where I was apprehensive all the way to the end, even though I knew the historical outcome.  Extremely well done.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story! I loved the love story, but what the Sky goes through to get to her soulmate, rips my heart out. I was not expecting all the twists and turns in this story!! Completely floored when the first chapter shows back up later in the book and you realize why. Definitely recommend this book!! Not for teenagers - contains subject matter that may not be appropriate (ex: rape, strong sexual content, suicide)
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I had to keep reading this final book in the series. Thought provoking and gripping. Read it every spare moment.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is what music has been missing. This CD is simply amazing. Every track listened to in full not a song skipped every single song is just amazing. That's all I have to say.  Purchase this album and support a real artist with real talent !!! :)
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. Loved it. Found I needed to keep reading it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|it crashed after a while and every time i tryed tp open it it would not. it would not open but when it did i loved it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The continuing drama. Had problems putting it down. This is a thought provoking story line which I recomend to all.
630522577X|5.0|It is what it is. I enjoyed it the second time as much as the first. Blah Blah Blah Blah
B005C9YZPA|4.0|When I recieved the product it came as it looked. It was beautiful and all of the DVD's were there and they all played beautifully except for one. It skipped and froze at the part that showed the fungi under the time lapse cameras. Once i fast forwarded past the part where it froze, the rest played fine. I would still recomend it whether you are getting it for yourself or for your kids.
1423136802|5.0|Both my 11 yr old and 8 year old LOVE the Olympians series!  Thanks for providing fun and good quality reading!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing Mystery Manor for quite sometime and just added it to my kindle fire. A great game!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Funny, and mysterious. Leaves you wondering what's going to happen next, and gets better with each episode. You will not regret watching this amazing show.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It was ok, kind of a cute story. Nice effects no great though. Will not be buying the blu ray though.
B009439HP8|5.0|One of my all-time favorite metal albums...  These guys RULE!!!  This pressing comes on orange tie-die vinyl and sounds absolutely amazing- prepare to blow your speakers out- I can't play this thing loud enough!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a very good read.  I was unable to put it down. This was a typical Nicholas Sparks book.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|I have these hooked up to a vinyl analog set-up with a tube pre-amp and a Class-A tube headphone amp.  They're extremely sensitive to the amount of power driving them- don't expect to get great sound from a budget amp on these.  The imaging and detail are fantastic, and the mid-range is really good right out of the box.  The low end takes time to develop- mine have about 50 hrs of music through them, and are still not quite where I want them, but they keep getting better.<br /><br />I can see 5 stars in the near future- they just need more time to settle in...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very good book!<br />Dr. Alexander wrote to his peers so that they might believe.  It is so important for God's word to be spread to non-believers.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Very interesting. A lot of good info about Europe. The story is good. The characters are mostly believable. KEPT MY INTEREST.
B005HIEFC4|4.0|Can't say that it is the best movie, but it was definitely funny and entertaining. The plot was very average.
B008Y73940|5.0|Just watched Lincoln Lawyer on my Kindle Fire! Loved it. I read the book about a year ago and thought it was great!
B004RC8NXI|4.0|Nothing outstanding about this movie, but it was definitely entertaining and funny.  I like both actors, and I think that made the difference.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this Kymera Magic Wand Remote Control as a Christmas gift. My friend absolutely loved it! He had fun using this Magic Wand and all his guests also loved it. Will buy as a gift for my other friends.
0425166805|2.0|This information is great fiction.<br /><br />The book, and the idea are old. Time to move on Von Daniken, along with all of your followers. For ONCE please, if you are going to go on with this idea come up with some new &#34;evidence&#34;. REAL evidence...not theory.
0345803493|5.0|Discovering Love involves a lot of patience, I have learnt a lot from this story, but most important is that our past plays a big role in what we become and how we behave and relate to others. That once we open up about our past, and realize can not deal with it alone but let in your loved ones, the burden becomes easier to carry. I am looking forward to reading book three, after which I would also like to write my story.
B00049QQHI|4.0|This film probably goes overboard in illustrating the negative side of illegal drug use, but I think that was intentional.  Drug use in The Basketball Diaries was never, ever cool.  And Leonardo DiCaprio, younger than you remember from the Titanic, smokes, drools, and curses his way to developing his character, all based on a true story.<br /><br />The acting was intense and raw.  Be prepared for watching lives come apart.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best works to date. Happy I was able to read it.  Can't wait for the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so absolutely FANTASTIC that I am at a loss for words. I'm SO glad it was selected for my bookclub to read! The writing was absolutely beautiful (for lack of a better word), yet the story, dialogue and character development flowed so naturally and totally pulled you into these young people's world. The writing was never pretentious, but it was sometimes humorous (despite involving the subject of cancer and young people!), often thought provoking, and always, ALWAYS captivating. As an older woman who lost her husband to cancer several years ago, I initially thought this book might be too difficult emotionally for me to read. NOT SO!!! I actually found it quite cathartic in a way I can't quite define. This is a book for teenagers and adults alike. Like another reviewer (Alex F, I believe) commented, unless you have a heart of stone, you will LOVE this book. Please do yourself a favor and read it IMMEDIATELY!! Now, I'm going to check out some other books by this author. If they can hold a candle to this one, I'm a fan for life!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Good app for general camera operation. Worth the effort to acquire and learn to use. Not easy to take picture while looking in to camera.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good book, couldn't put it down. Similar to 50 shades but not with toys. Can't wait for the next one in her series!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Muse is the band where the sound's should provide from an orchestra but those guys are only 3... The atmosphere are amazing very good advertising show.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I just finished this book I don't want to pick up another book because I just want to revel in the deliciousness of it all. Another book might make me forget the giddy feeling I got while reading it! At first, I wasn't quite sure about the hype (it was highly recommended by my online book club) but I got sucked in and I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />Young adult? Yes. Cheesy? Yes. Unrealistic? Perhaps. Fun and delicious? Yes!<br /><br />I normally am not a huge fan of YA fiction but this book was great!
B002ODEJYE|4.0|I appreciate the overall PINK performance and the show ambiance, it is a good show. Sometime the show direction move to some surprising way and the entertainment better deliver.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|... and for mom teenage children as well.  Alex and Stephen Kendrick did a great job producing a film that is not only top notch entertainment (funny and great drama/ outstanding acting) but it also has a great message and appeal.  It is a challenge for every father.  Every film Alex makes is better than the previous.  This is number 4, I think.  I am watching \\"Courageous\\" about twice a year since it was released.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love the game it's solo addicting lol can't put it down my children love it as well it's the frost thing my kids go to agree school :)
B008Y78M60|5.0|Awesome movie. I enjoyed this film. If you like historical movies you will like this one. Need to have more movies like this to watch.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I chose because a friend told me it was a good app I think it needs a place for all controls
B005VPRG10|4.0|I've been waiting for an updated version of all the basic Tie fighters, minus the silly Tie Crawler and the droid brain TIE/d, which has rectangular wings. My son and I have every Tie thus produced and I was stoked to see a much sleeker version of the TIE/LN or &#34;standard&#34; Tie come out to replace the older black with blue accent models. I'm hoping they redo the Tie Interceptor. The older sets are worth more to collectors, but since I have no intention of ever selling any of our massive collection, I am happy to see new and better models come out. Anyway, #9492 is a great model and we only like the Defender (#8087) better, out of all our Tie collection. It is also nice that the set comes with four minifigs, three of them fairly uncommon. I feel it was a good value and we bought a wing of three sets. Highly recommended.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I thought this was a great story and very well done.  Great period piece!  This was the second time I have watched the series and I enjoyed as much as the first time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The seasons go on with more and more interesting storylines and a good insight into what that period of time was like to live in.  Very taken with this series - it really is amazing!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating. I have read other books about introversion before, but this one really helped things fall into place for me. Her explanation of highly reactive vs low reactive was a revelation. It was also refreshing to hear an argument for the benefits of solitary work. Not everything is done better as a Team! I shared some of the book with an extrovert co worker. She has an introverted daughter and said it gave her insight to her daughter's approach to the world. I highly recommend this book.
B00633W614|5.0|Read all of Archer's books and enjoy them all.  Recommend them to friends with no reservation. Can't wait for the next installment of Clifton Chronicles.  He always leaves you hanging.
B001OSIV62|4.0|Interesting story of the time before, the moments of and then the fall out after this epic, somewhat forgotten event that changed the lives of all involved.
1579129129|4.0|Beautifully photographed. The only thing to add would be the provenance of the skulls...where in the world did they come from?
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|This is not a review of the movie, but of the combo pack itself (Amazon should really separate these into two categories).<br /><br />BEWARE:  The \\"Digital Copy\\" included with this release requires that you download a third party viewer to actually watch it.  You cannot simply add it to your iTunes or Windows Media Library.  Warner Brothers really needs to get their act together and stop this lunacy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Definitely need to read the series in order to appreciate the interaction of the characters.  5 more words required.  1 more word required.
B0054SMID0|2.0|Predictable, formulaic, cliche.  Disappointed that such a mediocre movie has such a great cast -- Matthew McGonaughey, William H. Macey, Marisa Tomei, Brian Cranston -- could not carry the weak and predictable dialogue.  Characters are shallow and two-dimensional.  Disclaimer: In all fairness, I stopped watching about 30 minutes before the end during the big courtroom scene.  I just wasn't confident that the conclusion of the movie would make up for the disappointing stoyline and dialogue up to that point.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|i follow the series.  i needed to buy it to stream as the episodes came out.  the characters show growth, but the basic premise of the series is the same.  it's the closest thing i watch to a soap opera.  the bikes make it more interesting, i think.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an addictive and wonderfully done program. We watch a couple episodes each evening. Thanks Amazon for carrying it!!
0525953728|4.0|I found this interesting and was glad to read the 'true' story but it was a little technical for me. Would be enjoyed by a man interested in the military.
B000GOY3I0|3.0|It was a good movie, but of coarse some of the things were cheesy. Although, what else should I expect?  Its a story about the richest kid in the world.
0525478817|5.0|I was anticipating a really sad story.  It is sad but it is also uplifting.  Very well written and enjoyable to read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is one that once you start reading it, you cannot put it down. I have not found many books like this one to read.
B00631VJIC|5.0|It make you feel like you are watching the shows again!  Great music for anyone that love music!  Highly recommend!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it, and can't wait for the next book in the series!! :) I will definitely be reading more by this author in the future!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Really loved watching at home on my new TV. Best James Bond movie ever.  Can't wait for the next movie!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Movie was fantastic.  Loaded immediately and with no interruption in streaming.  We don't go out to the video store much anymore.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote is a great product. it syncs between multiple devices and has many features, even the free version.  great for keeping up with multiple projects/ideas.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|Love this movie and the ease of loading.  Daughter waited for this to come out on DVD and loves the fact that she can watch it anywhere on her device.
B00371XIJE|5.0|great movie about a dog and his love for his owner. cried but then very happy because it shows the unconditional love a dog has for it's owner.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Well worth the price to watch great acting and excellent script! This is a keeper to watch over and over. Do not miss out on this great series!
0446580848|1.0|I am a big Nelson DeMille fan, but this book was a dud, in my opinion.  Too much wisecracking and not enough plot.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Easy to install, very sturdy, very stylish. I get lots of great compliments on it. I may buy another one to stack them on top of each other or side by side.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Before I get too critical here, just let me say that yes, I am a fan of Justin Timberlake and am ecstatic that he decided to release an album that flies in the face of pretty much every convention that's big in the music industry right now. This new album is one of those rare records where the artist is obviously very involved and genuinely passionate about what they are doing, which admirably results in a listening experience - and it truly IS an experience, as the title suggests - like nothing else out there in the public eye at the moment. However, there is a point where one perhaps tries TOO hard to set themselves apart from the pack, and I'm afraid The 20/20 Experience has fallen victim to its own good intentions. There are more than enough instances where the production is dragged out to the point where it becomes abstract and aimless, tedious and dull, and to be blunt, just plain uninteresting. By no means is this me saying it's a \\"bad\\" album necessarily, but I also suspect that if it were anyone but Justin Timberlake's name on the cover, it would have quietly slipped under most of our radars completely.<br /><br />Despite the many mixed reviews of the album's first single, Suit and Tie, the fact is it was a wise choice because it is by far the most blatantly commercial track. It's upbeat, instantly recognizable, if not incredibly profound, and includes the obligatory ghetto rap interlude which radio loves so much (though I haven't met anyone else who does). Obviously this goes against what I just said about breaking away from the mainstream, but public interest had to be piqued somehow I suppose, and it worked. Personally I was hoping for at least one really good dance/club track in the vein of Rock Your Body or Lovestoned, but unfortunately there's nothing like that to be found here. The Latin-tinged Let the Groove In comes close, but basically consisting of one sentence looped six-hundred times over, it never really builds up to anything memorable. Don't Hold the Wall held my attention with its underlying tribal beats, and both Mirrors and Blue Ocean Floor have gorgeously lush instrumental compositions, but again, aren't likely songs you'll be caught singing along with. Timberlake, who has always had a knack for channeling his inner Sinatra, falls somewhat flat on meandering, melody-less tracks like Strawberry Bubblegum, That Girl, and Spaceship Coupe, but manages to wake us up again with bonus tracks Dress On and Body Count (available exclusively from the \\"red bullseye\\" retailer, hint hint). One of the few tracks that doesn't feel so sparse is Tunnel Vision, but it's still a jolting aural assault with too many random noises happening all at once to be enjoyable.<br /><br />I know it sounds like I just did a lot of criticizing there, but like I said before I really do want to praise Mr. Timberlake for putting out something unique and experimental. He's obviously a very creative soul. But at the same time there's such a disconnect between the artist and the listener that makes the whole thing very disengaging. It's almost like the record is comprised of one long studio jam session; there's an enormous amount of talent on display here but it's mostly of the \\"making it up as you go along\\" variety and lacks the structure I imagine most commercial audiences would crave. Not that I consider myself a proponent of commercial tastes, mind you - I feel artists like Darren Hayes, Tori Amos, and Prince excel at these kinds of \\"high concept\\" albums -  but that still doesn't change the fact nothing here is catchy. I'm also trying to picture these songs performed live in concert and all I see is people dozing in their seats, lol. Nevertheless I get what he was going for and I can appreciate that, I'm just saying I've seen it done better. Anyway, it's interesting to discuss and theorize about, but it just isn't a CD I'm going to be pulling out very often for entertainment purposes.old the Wall held my attention with its underlying tribal beats, and both Mirrors and Blue Ocean Floor have gorgeously lush instrumental compositions, but again, aren't likely songs you'll be caught singing along with.

B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly is a very good rss reader app.  I'm using it as a replacement for google reader.  This could be a great app with a few more of the desktop chrome features.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really like the way this book was written. All the story's and points of view from around the world. How each culture reacts to the war, and how it progresses through the book. I'm curious, and already disappointed how I believe the movie is being filmed. I only expect one, maybe two points of view from the book. I expect Yonkers and the urn around at hope, but wish they can incorporate some international story's like the aqueducts of London and the \\"the tiger of new deli\\". All in all I'm suggesting this book to everyone I know, before the movie comes out.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Excellent book this story has never gotten old and is fun to read every time I pick it up. Awsome.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Wow -  the lost tapes!  Hendrix was undoubtedly the best rock guitarist ever to grace the stage - I miss him so much -  imagine if he was still alive what he would be doing!  Well, these lost songs are almost like he is still here! Awesome! Thank you to whomever found these songs and let us hear it!  A+++
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Funny, funny movie with lots of great music and dancing.  I watch it over and over !!!  I highly recommend it.
0345803485|2.0|I consider myself to be an avid reader, and i will read pretty much read anything. So when i heard the hype over this series, i was weary. I can understand why someone would like the male character but the female is just ridiculous. If u are interested in the dom/sub genre then i recommend beautys punishment. 50 shades was a soft version of this life style & who wouldnt fall in love with a billionaire. But i spent so much time saying this is so laughable, that i almost tossed it out. But someone dared me to read.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|All the actors are terrific on this show and the story lines are consistently interesting.  It is a high class series.
B006512BFU|4.0|I purchased this movie, now I know what region I reside in, purchased DVD that wont play in my DVD player, it's not their fault it was mine, still searching for this movie in my region. Guest next time I will play closer attention to non-usa format, it has nothing to do with the ratings.  lol
B002VECM6S|5.0|Came just as described and in a speedy matter. I am very please to have done business with you.  Thanks!
B007VUA7VO|2.0|It didn't install and I deleted it. I tried several times to turn it on and never did come up.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have been reading NDE books. This is one of the extremes on a spectrum of totally innocent (Heaven is for Real) to this one in which Alexander goes to great lengths to show that his NDE was not the product of his own brain. Proof of Heaven makes a strong case for the existence of an afterlife.
B00ANVX6DY|1.0|Item was missing the activity kit and tiara as mentioned in the description at the time I purchased. Disappointed because I could have purchased elsewhere that had similar item for about the same price.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|Baby boomers will enjoy this quirky well-written, humorous book. It is the type of novel that leaves you wondering how certain characters are doing today.  Although I found the people interesting, I didn't like any of them.
1451678193|4.0|My quickie review of Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles:<br /><br />The book reads like a group of short stories but all put together makes one big story.<br /><br />Storyline: In the future, people go to Mars to make it a new \\"Earth\\" since they've done a great job destroying Earth.  Martians get sick with human diseases and die.  We ruin Mars just like we ruined Earth.  A war breaks out on Earth. . .<br /><br />I enjoyed this book but it has a lot of warnings for us.<br /><br />Warning 1: Don't destroy our Earth, it's the only one we have.<br />Warning 2: Stop the racism and prejudices.<br />Warning 3: Don't be so afraid of the unknown.<br /><br />Martian Chronicles was a short read that could be seen as depressing sci-fi.  I read it in high school but definitely have a better understanding of the novel now, as an adult.<br /><br />Thanks to Sarah Says Read for reading it with me!  (I know, Sarah, it took me forever to get this post up since we read it a while ago!)<br /><br />Have you read The Martian Chronicles?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B007P6VM04|4.0|I really enjoy the show but I thought this would be better-there were a few songs that had been in the show that were not on the CD.  If you like the music of &#34;bombshell&#34;, buy that CD, not this one.
0316228532|5.0|JK Rowling has again shown that she is one of the greatest authors of all time with her newest work, The Casual Vacancy. She has shown the world that she can write not only magical fantasy books, but beautiful adult fictional novels as well. While it is not the easiest book to read in one sitting, it is still definitely a book to pick up.<br /><br />I don't understand why people rate this book so low. I understand that there are themes in this book that are difficult to read about, but Rowling describes them in a way that makes perfect sense for this novel. Also, look at the success of books like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Fifty Shades of Grey. Both of these novels contain questionable themes, but both novels are also worldwide best sellers. Why should The Casual Vacancy be any different? Just because a wonderful children's book author wrote it doesn't mean it can't still have this content and be successful.<br /><br />This novel has very powerful elements in it, and it is definitely a book for these times. It touches on important issues that children, teenagers, and adults face quite often. The satirical moments in this book make it easy to laugh despite the darker moments that occasional bring tears to the reader.<br /><br />I highly encourage everyone who is ready to take on this heavier read. It will change the way you view the world. This novel about contemporary England can be applied anywhere in the world. It is easy to relate to some of the characters and you can quickly find yourself in their shoes. Don't go into this novel thinking it will be like Harry Potter, or your eyes will be closed to the beauty that is contained in this wonderful novel.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I have loved Kenny Loggins for over 30 years and always go to see him when he's in my area.  Last year, this &#34;group&#34; opened for him.  I was thrilled-they are all skilled musicians and singers.  I looked for the CD to come out and as soon as I saw it, I bought it.  Like I said, if you enjoy Kenny Loggins' music, you will enjoy this CD-the other man and woman are a married couple.  It works!
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Overall, this was a cute movie that provides all the things you'd expect from a Disney film. The animation is astoundingly good, and most of the voice acting was great. I liked how they modified the tale of Rapunzel and made the female character the real hero.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I enjoyed this but there were some songs that were in the show that were not on here-I would have given it 5 stars if they were on here.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game kids love it. It keeps them occupied and they love painting the different themes in the game. Great
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for kids. Like that there are chores in it, just like with real horses. Love the sharp graphics to.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I ONLY GOT THIS FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE THEY LOVE MAKING MUSIC. AS LONG AS THEY ENJOY IT IM HAPPY
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|its okay.  Really all i wanted to do is rate it with stars because i don't have anything of value to say about it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first i just got the game for my kids. Then one day i played and became addicted. Its not only for kids but for grown ups too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say I really enjoy watching the coming and goings of this manor house in early 20th century England.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther is a fitting addition to the John Corey legend.  I would have liked a follow up the fall out from The Lion, but all in all this was a good read.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Best Show EVER!!!! Love Love Love it! I hate it when the season comes to an end and I have to wait for it to start again! Summer is too long of a break!
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Great recording - this is one to keep for years to come.  Julie Andrews and cast make for a classic addition to your library and the sound quality on this one is worth the price.
B0018OIK0E|1.0|I thought this movie was silly and not worth the money. I actually fell asleep. So if your into the silly type of comedy this is definitely for you.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I love it you don't have to find your dictionary you can just find it on your device I just LOVE it
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie was good a little slow to get going but has a very good ending. I would recommend to others to watch.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The tiles are not distinct. The layouts are nice, but visually, the display is boring. So much more could have been done to distinguish the game
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We watched this movie the other day and enjoyed it. Some what set up as a documentary and has some hidden meanings to it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars. I got into Feedly because Google Reader is going to disappear. I'm learning how to use both the desktop version of Feedly and this app on the Kindle Fire HD. It is possible that the one or two issues I currently have with this app will disappear as I learn how to use it, just as the worst of the issues disappeared on the desktop yesterday as I discovered that what I wanted to do was actually easy to do.<br /><br />There is one possible problem with Feedly in all of its variations and that is whether they will get the back end Normandy finished before Google pulls the plug. Right now it is working off Google's back end. I've even logged in using my Google log in and not a separate one. Still right now it works very well, and I'm enjoying both the app and the web based computer version.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I liked this movie even though I am not usually a fan of brutal action movies. The situation with the characters is a little strange but all in all good movie. I would watch it again.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I really like the movie<br />Had not heard about it, but was board and rented on prime. Pleasant surprise and good movie to watch with the hubby too!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|What is not too like about this show!  It has such great acting and interesting - and funny plot lines. I can't wait for Season 5.
B009JZTP4Y|2.0|Did you notice that we spent millions on our model of the starship Enterprise?  No?  How about another 3 minute flyby.  Still didn't catch it?  How about a 4 minute flyby?  Sill no?....<br /><br />For whatever reasons, the director (and/or producers) felt this way about almost every scene - filling minute after minute with 'dead air' as state of the art special effects (circa 1979) fill the screen.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|What is not too like about this show!  It has such great acting and interesting - and funny plot lines. I can't wait for Season 4.
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|This is a very brief (less than a half hour) album of 8 songs that still does a decent job of capturing the mood of the show despite its shortcomings (and yes, it is a bit overpriced for what it is). In fact, I found myself very much enjoying the vast majority of the tracks on this album (the only one I can really live without is the &#34;The Parting Glass&#34; sung by Emily Kinney, who plays Beth on the show, and backed up by Lauren Cohan, aka Maggie. However, that being said, it would have been an appropriate way to end the album as the last track). Speaking of track placement, I would have placed the Title Theme first to start the experience off like you would the show, but that is just me.  However, as I am sure many other reviewers will point out, this album lacks a number of great songs, including all but one of Bear McCreary's compositions (and the one included is a re-mix). This is why, despite the strong collection of songs present, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would have preferred to have given it 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded up. Here is a list I put together of songs that I think would add to your enjoyment of the soundtrack, though please note that this is by no means a fully comprehensive list of what was left off the album, especially considering I am not familiar enough with McCreary's work to speak to that.  -&#34;Space Junk&#34; -Wang Chung. (A surprisingly good song from the 80's band best known for &#34;Dance Hall Days&#34; & &#34;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&#34; [you know you have to sing the rest: &#34;Everybody Wang Chung tonight&#34;]. You can hear this at the end of the first episode and it fits in well)  -&#34;Civilian&#34;-Wye Oak  -&#34;The Regulator&#34;-Clutch  -&#34;Hold On&#34;-Tom Waits  -&#34;Sunshine&#34;- (Instrumental) John Murphy  -&#34;Tomorrow Is A Long Time&#34;-Bob Dylan  -&#34;I'm A Man&#34;-Black Strobe  -&#34;The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore&#34;-The Walker Brothers (how appropriate is the name of this band?)  I am notgoing to attempt to touch on the McCreary tracks that are missing other than to say that it would be great if they would release an actual score for the show in addition to the soundtrack. However, I will go into a few of the songs that were omitted. Three of my favorite songs that you can hear in the series are &#34;Hold On&#34; by Tom Waits, &#34;Civlian&#34; by Wye Oak and &#34;The Regulator&#34; by Clutch. (BTW, if you really want to get pumped up for fighting zombies, &#34;The Regulator&#34; is the perfect song to do it.).  I personally think those 3 songs are must haves, and you can actually get Wye Oak's &#34;Civilian&#34; for free on Amazon via the &#34;Merge Records Sampler 2011.&#34; Download it, you won't be disappointed. (And even if you are, did I mention it's free?)  Maybe AMC will release another volume and/or score that will include some of the missing songs, but I am guessing that licensing issues probably had something to do with at least a few of the omissions, especially with Dylan or Waits type guys. Hopefully this review will help some of you put together a more complete soundtrack to this epic show if you so choose. Enjoy!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|What is not too like about this show!  It has such great acting and interesting - and funny plot lines.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Nothing like the original - this one is funny yet has the requisite Johnny Depp oddness!  A real delight.  Highly recommended!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love my kindle fire hd, facebook and pinterest...love that I have them all together with the apps. However the only problem that I have with the pinterest app is that when I repin and try to share on facebook it will not let me check the box to share on facebook.  I have went to all my settings and check if all settings are right and they are. The only way I can share to facebook is if I share everything I pin...I would love to share only what i want by either checking or unchecking facebook box and I can't....If anyone has any suggestions please let me know....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was about my favorite book on this planet. It amazes me how well this book is organized.  It is my favorite book ever
B005BOHYW2|4.0|The descriptions of life as a foster child in unsatisfactory placement homes and hostels are graphic and thought-provoking.  It was very moving to experience the feelings of a girl deeply affected by life experiences at a young age and how she coped with setting up her own business through what she had learned about flowers and their language in the one home in which she felt secure.  Her journey back to that home, through a life of hardship and misunderstanding is riveting reading.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Funny, sad, romantic, and beautifully done! Amazing job by Helen Hunt and all off the actors in this film. I will watch again!
B00846WWVM|5.0|It's kinda like Swampy but it's a little different because you have to turn off the fires before the houses are burned down

B006LSZECO|4.0|The twists and turns in this book were so unexpected and made for a great read.  The ending was also unexpected, however, very unsatisfying.  I wanted more closure!!
B005F9CP7M|2.0|I gave the CD that was listed a 5 star rating.  The one I received; the tracks were in a different order and one of my favorite song Enemy was not even on it.  Also some of the songs sound different than the original I bought (which I lost unfortunately).  If I received the CD with the tracks listed in the description I would have been perfectly satisfied.  If you are going to sell a different product than listed please let the consumer know.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|I love Dire Straits.  Always have and always will.  Mark Knopfler's composing, guitar playing and singing stand any test of time.

B009UX2YAC|2.0|I think this is a great game but the worst part is that it wont respond to my touch sometimes. But when it does; like when I swipe up it thinks I need to swipe over.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is one of the note apps that's been around for a while and is very popular. As a result, it's been well tested, debugged, and refined over the years and you can expect a smooth, bug-free, and capable app when you buy it. Evernote has exceptional file and information handling capabilities and allows you to capture, store and share not just notes but photos, webpages, freehand drawings and graphics, and pretty much anything you want. The premium edition allows your friends to access and modify your notes and so offers group collaboration capabilities.<br /><br />Another area Evernote excels in is the sheer number and diversity of its companion apps. Just a quick look at what was available at the Apple store revealed no less than 20 and there were more that I didn't bother to scroll through when I stopped. These included:<br /><br />Evercrane--a file and note management app providing quick sorting and moving features<br />Moveover--another file and note management app<br />Clever--a powerful interface and client app with many useful functions (too many to list here)<br />Evernote Food--a recipe program<br />Evernote Hello--a powerful contacts manager<br />vJournal for Evernote--a daily journal program<br />FastEver--quickly add notes, tags, and organize notes into notebooks<br />Everclip--a webpage clipper<br />FastEver Snap--a camera for Evernote<br />EverConvertor--a currency converter for Evernote<br />CheckEver--a way to manage your checklists<br />QEver--add reminders to your notes<br />ENPower--quick access to your Evernote notes, notebooks, and  tags<br />MultiSnap--quickly snap and send photos<br />MoveEver--another powerful sort and organizer app similar to MoveOver and Evercrane<br />Tap2Ever--fast Evernote uploader<br />EverGear--note and photo posting app<br />EverWord--EverNote flashcards app with database-like capabilities<br />EverEPub--make an EPub book from your notes<br />EverLog--a logging and posting app for EverNote<br /><br />That's just some of the companion apps that I saw. There are more and there is often more than one app available in a particular category (note management, daily journal, etc.) so that if you don't like that particular companion app there may be another you will like.<br /><br />In reading the reviews here I note that some people didn't like Evernote wanting access to all of their contacts, which they considered an invasion of privacy. So if this is a probem for you you should consider that before buying the app.<br /><br />Overall Evernote offers a lot of value for the money and has the most add-ons and companion apps of any app in the note category. There is something for just about everyone so if you're looking for a good note and task app Evernote is one of the top offerings that you should consider.some of the companion apps that I saw.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It made me want to vomit. The writer actually has talent, however, James chooses to send his readers into a negative and evil mindset. You may not believe in hell but this book will definitely strip you of whatever moral standards you had in the first place.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, and couldn't download it fast enough when I bought it immediately after finishing Fall of Giants!  Follett is a genius in the way he tied the families of Fall of Giants to their children in this one.  I want to learn more about WWI & II since I finished these two books.  There are a [very] few parts that are emotionally hard to read, as are many stories from the Holocaust, but Follett does it in a respectful and dignified way.  I feel like I've lived through You won't be able to put the book down.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was not written well but what can you expect from a neurosurgeon? It is still incredible and an absolutely amazing true story. A must read.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  EXCELLENT fiction, and I couldn't put it down.  I began to truly hate some of the evil lords and &#34;holy&#34; men from 1300's England. And I fell in love with the characters who are descended from Tom Builder, Jack Jackson (Jack Builder), Lady Aliena.  Follett gives us a vivid image of how the townspeople, monks, and nuns from the past lived their lives for the sole purpose of making the world a better place for future generations.  He also illustrates the struggles they dealt with in such a way that I felt like I lived it myself.
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|I enjoyed all the seasons of lost, I wish it could of kept going. I was shocked by the suprise ending, wish it could of ended differently.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Keeps you interested from the beginning to the end.  I would recommend to anyone.  It follows the movie almost the same.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|So I was introduced to this group on SYTYCD, I heard it used to accompany a dance, that I loved the song stuck with me. I like this style of music, the album is full of great songs, you can't go wrong with this purchase, in my opinion.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's one of the best game I've ever played in my life<br /><br />It's one of the  best games I have ever played.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I am a fan of hers, there are a great songs on the album. The best song to me by far is &#34;Stay&#34;. It feels honest and raw to me.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I think the game is great, it's definitely one of the best shooters on the kindle if it isn't the best (though Dead Space is pretty great). There were some lag issues, but mostly my issues were these:<br />  Voice acting is comical at best. It seems like the hardened war veterans still haven't quite figured out how to swear... But it isn't a big issues, doesn't take from gameplay. Though there is a great deal of F bombs so parents be aware.<br />  Multiplayer is a bit frustrating, it makes no effort to match you with players of your skill and it's often hard to find a match with more than 6 players in it. The worst part is that it doesn't mix teams after a match. If you played with noobs, you're stuck with them.<br />  Gameloft is a great company, don't get me wrong, but they love to add microcharges. Of course they aren't required, but earning gold through multiplayer gameplay is extremely tedious. Frankly for a game you pay $7 for the multiplayer shouldn't be a cash competition.<br />All around the game is good, gameplay is easy and fun, definetely worth the 99&cent; I got it for. However with the multiplayer gold system being so difficult to earn with spending real cash I'd put it's actual value lower than $7. At the same time, it is (somewhat unfortunately) the best multiplayer shooter on the kindle fire. Good luck!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|As the title suggests this album is fun. The songs are great and my daughter and I both really enjoy turning it on and dancing to it.
B004GCK6XY|5.0|British romantic comedy is always entertaining to watch. Conversations like &#34;There's something wrong with this yogurt!&#34; &#34;..that's not yogurt, that's mayonnaise.&#34; &#34;Oh, right then..is good!&#34; are just the tip of the iceberg. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are brilliant, as are their fantastic supporting cast.
B006A819AG|5.0|I don't really know how else to describe this. I love this band, I have seen them in concert a few times and they never disappoint. Neither does this album, I love how they aren't afraid to reach.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I was excited to get the full version on my kindle fire. Looks good But having trouble with it cutting out in the middle of posting or reading. Hope they fine tune it a little more then it will be great.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I received a unit that had different functionality than what was described.  I received a unit without 1/8&#34; output.<br />This made me rethink my application a little bit as I was counting on the 1/8&#34; connection.<br />The conversion of this unit is flawless.  All source material sounds great.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|This is just a really feel good funny movie.  To me it's just a good clean movie that's funny!  I've never grown tired of it.
B0000695JP|1.0|Don't you think if you are shipping a product someplace that it won't work, you may want to warn them.  Yup, we received the DVD but it won't work outside of Europe.  SO I was excited to have it for the kids for movie night and it would not work.  But as my kids would say, 1st world problems.  Oh well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know the last book received a lot of criticism from readers, but I loved it.  It felt like a &#34;real&#34; ending.  I know a book has really gotten to me when I think about it from time to time, randomly, and I do that will this book a lot.  Can't wait for the movies!
B008ODZUN2|3.0|plot line and time line was very choppy.<br />The ending was too abrupt and difficult to fathom how it could have an optimistic twist.
0802473156|5.0|I've never been one for relationship books and have this image in my head of them being perfectly fine reads, just cheesy, non-enlightening and not for me. I'm reminded of the Saturday my husband and I spent at our pre-marriage seminar with uncomfortable exercises, forced conversations and boring lectures. A healthy marriage is about communication, trust and mutual respect. It's about showing appreciation and gratitude, not judging, complaining and criticizing. I get it. However, I had been hearing a lot about Chapman's book and, without a book in my queue, I decided to give it a shot. I'm gad I did because the 5 Love Languages was a real eye opener for me. I devoured it in 2 days.<br /><br />Chapman says that we identify with one or more of 5  'love languages' that represents the way that we show and appreciate love.<br />1. Words of Affirmation<br />2. Quality Time<br />3. Acts of Service<br />4. Gifts<br />5. Physical Touch<br /><br />We love the way we want to be loved. Picking up my husband's dry cleaning (an `act of service') is my way of showing him that I love him. It's my love language. So when he fails to acknowledge my good deed and worse yet, reciprocate with simple chores around the house, I become a resentful nag. My husband, on the other hand, values `quality time'. He'd rather sit and have a glass of wine with me than do the dishes because that's his way of giving love. I realize that i'm the first one to complain about his watching sports or playing golf, when I should instead take an interest in his teams and hobbies. Now I'm not going to hunker down and watch all 166 major league baseball games, but I will root for them. And maybe, just maybe, i'll turn into an honest fan.<br /><br />Yes, much of Chapman's book is common sense, but I appreciate his simple and straightforward style. I don't need all of the science and the research and I'm a sucker for success stories.  Working on your relationship should be a priority for all couples and Chapman gives us simple strategies on how to improve not only our communication, but also how to listen to one another and adapt your own behavior.ves us simple strategies on how to improve not only our communication, but also how to listen to one another and adapt your own behavior.
B0083GCK5G|5.0|THe Beach Boys have endured on the scene for many years. And as you listen to this compilation of songs, you will soon realize that they still have what it takes to sing and play the best sun 'n' surf songs ever!<br />Fine vocals and good vibrations all the way.<br />As a life long fan of their music, this is a great gift from the original surf band. Buy it now!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary is intelligent and edgy without pushing too far. The plotlines are compelling. The dialogue is smooth but smart. Mr. Miller's rapid fire rejoinders and Ms. Liu's thoughtful plot revelations are great. Liu's Dr. Watson is a perfect foil for Miller's Holmes. The acting is superb - kudos to Mr. Miller and Ms. Liu for a great first season. We are looking forward to more.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Of course, we had seen this on the big screen and had to have one all our own.  Just as wonderful on DVD
B009EEFTMC|5.0|We play it on our Kindle Fire and it's great fun. Cool graphics. Fun to spin the cube in order to see the different sides. Except for the annoying sounds (you can turn off the music, but not the gurgling blip it makes when cubes disappear), it's all right. I just turn my volume setting to zero when I'm in public. Good clean fun that encourages better hand-eye coordination and quick response. It's &#34;concentration&#34; in 3D.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on TV--ever.  Since it has plots on the upstairs and downstairs it makes it twice as good.
B002N2LEVM|4.0|From what I've read, much of the reason the second season is so good is because they knew early on that they wouldn't get renewed, so they wrapped up the show quickly.  And that seems to be the case when you watch it, but it makes for a fast paced final few episodes, so it worked out in their favor I think.  If you can get past the first 3 episodes of the first season, the overall show is very worth the ride.  But Season one, episode 3?  UGH!  Awful.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|This movie is GREAT, love the Paranormal flicks and if you get the chance to watch all off them in a row then you will get the just of the series.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Very entertaining.  I am a long-time customer of Big Fish Games and was happy to find one of their Match 3 games available for my Kindle.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and all the returning charators, This new series will be GREAT to follow ,just as was in LOTR was, if not more!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BBW16HW|4.0|I thought it was a good movie. Enjoyed the chemistry between the two men and how they both came around.
B009AMALGM|5.0|This movie is GREAT to me ,,they left the end open for another. Please if you have the chance to watch Paranormal Films in a row ,do so ,you will ENJOY the movies better and get the jest of the PARANORMAL Films!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is a highly entretaining book to read and the characters are so well-rounded by the writer. I lked the fact that it gives you something to think about and invites you to enjoy your life and love fearlessly, so it is more than just light reading.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|This is one of the games i always come back to time after time its graphics and music are out of this world \\"literaly\\" and the mechanics of the game have a good mix of randomness and skill by the choices you choose to make and how many of you items you blow on a single quest.<br />I really enjoy the theme of the game and this a no brainer to buy,i wish there were more of these translated board game type things as id DEFINETLY buy them and the fact its based on h p lovecraft storys just makes it even better.
0307346617|3.0|I thought Max Brook's previous zombie book was entertaining and engaging but I am disappointed in this one. The \\"oral history\\" approach, at best, is fragmented and tedious. At worst, it seems a lazy alternative to actually offering a narrative. About half-way through the book, I found myself reading just because I don't like to abandon a book I've invested some time in. In this case, I might have done better to cut my losses. In his defense, he's clearly thought through a large and complex story about how a zombie apocalypse might actually play out, but I just don't think he presents it well.
B00002DE4H|5.0|I bought this mostly to legally own a copy.  So many songs on here are must-have's, and I'd rather have the album than piecemeal it from singles.  I was going to get one of their best-of sets, but the music snob in me decided to go this route instead.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|beautifully done....all cast;s performances were superb....there should be more movies made like this one with a beautiful message to all....
B002L3ARRU|5.0|The quality wasn't as good as I had hoped, above VHS but slightly below SD DVD.  Still, this is a classing and it was a good choice for late night entertainment.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I am in love with Joe Bonamassa's music! Cannot believe I hadn't heard of him before! Not wasting any time and getting more of his amazing music. Just waiting for him to come to our city to buy tickets for one of his incredible concerts! Extremely happy with this purchase! Love, love, love it!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Compared to the majority of books I read, which are in the top 10 from week-to-week, I hated this book.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|I've liked everything I've read by Gladwell. This was the first I read and kept me coming back for more.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|We enjoyed this presentation because it seemed to reflect the issues faced by urban high school students and the desire of a caring mentor to help them overcome adversity. This a family film that we would highly recommend.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Another great album by Clutch.  It is short, fast and to the point.  Gone Cold is the song that seems out of place.  I like the song but it seems weird to hear it in the middle of the album.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|For me, Dawkins was preaching to the choir (so to speak). Although I was raised Catholic, religion didn't make much sense to me even when I was very young, but I love the lucidity of his arguments and the humor. From now on, I'll wear my badge of atheism proudly.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Probably deserved 5stars, gave it 4 simply because it wasn't quite my personal favorite style of writing. Bought it due to a recommendation from another Brandon Sanderson fan thinking their styles would relate. They did not. Lol. This ended up being more of a &#34;great work&#34; for me rather than a great story. It reminds me of an independent film. You know the story had to be told however by the end you are left wishing, albeit a bit childishly, there'd been more detail to the action(more magic, explosions, etc), more character relate-ability. Good read just wasn't blown away I guess. I'd still recommend it.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Kids loved this movie, specially their favorite personalities like tooth fairy, Santa, Easter bunny and jack frost. It has a nice blend of action, emotion and fun for kids to enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app for all types of calculations. Useful and well designed. It also looks great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Love the narrative style. Great story. The power of being positive to get through tough times.  I saw the movie first and that made reading the book more enjoyable because it gave the characters personality.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|I am sooooo glad I looked this up after hearing a 'off-beat' Valentine Day movie selections.  The other reviews really sold me on this movie and did not disappoint.  Highly recommend this movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Entertaining for young adults and set adults as well.  Was a very quick read that made me want to get my hands on the next book!
B000FA57N0|1.0|This DVD will not play on any player or computer that I or any of my friends have. Rip Off!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows on television right know. I hope there are many more seasons to come. Just awesome!
B00AEVQZWC|5.0|Listen and admire. Here are the seventeen more words required for an album you should probably buy or not buy based on your preferences.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|It was easy for me to jump on this purchase. Prior to this release I have read all the previous Rebus books and as much as I hated to see the character retire, this offering certainly hit the spot once again. The insight, humor and smooth writing continues to make Ian Rankin one of the great &#34;in-depth&#34; character crime novelists!  As a periodic visitor to Scotland, his description of places, specific areas and a feel for the locale make me feel like I'm back there. Bottom line: Great character, great story!  I felt Rebus getting old along with myself, but he still has it!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Keep them coming Lee<br />I look forward to more Child &#34;reacher books&#34;<br />reacher is every mans inner self..<br />Whats next?
B009S33I68|3.0|This book is very fast moving.  It has so many people to follow, it is hard to follow them.  It would have greatly helped to have a LARGE Map of Viet Nam to be able to follow the battles within this book.<br />John K.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved this one...<br />Rapp is badass and VF keep me turning the pages..<br />Look forward to more..<br />movie in the making perhaps?
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Imagine your Commander aborts your mission on Mars (thinking you were dead in space suit during an EVA), takes her crew and  rockets away in the lander, accidentally stranding you.  You need to utilize the remaining equipment available to you to save your life.  You have no way to communicate.  Dan Quayle knows what can save you...
0385536828|5.0|McEwan must have had a lot of fun writing this book about a novelist and would-be British spy of sorts. It really captures the mood of the 1970s, poking fun at the era, at the espionage trade, and at the ego of authors and readers. They say every great novelist has to write one book about writing and this is McEwans. A fun read.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I had put off buying this for many years, but finally took the plunge, and have already enjoyed them a few times.  The price was reasonable, and I received them in a timely manner.  I am happy with the product and the seller.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like that you can earn new places to play and pay bingo  or slots. I was surprised that this game has so much to do. Very fun.
B008ODZUN2|2.0|I have a major crush on Rachel Wieze an she has alot of sex. So the movie actually sucks...very boring other then her delicous teasing..You'd have to just be a fan of Rachel to watch. A lotion an kleenex flick...thnx Rachel!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This was a suggestion from one of my sisters and I didn't want it to end.  For those that want to know what it's about, in a gist it's about an irish girl who's parents died on ship coming to America and a plantation owner brings her home and sticks her in the 'kitchen house' and is treated like a slave-until she grows up.  Very easy read.  I'm really not a big history buff, but after this book it made me want to read a little more in regards to slavery (which I did).  This became an interest because of the difficulties this girl had with being a white girl raised as a slave, and who didn't know the difference. Anyways, very very good read and I highly recommend it!!
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Steven Spielberg  put the best actors together and tells a story of history.  Little-known court case regarding slaves a few years before the Civil War where John Quincy Adams argued before the Supreme Court regarding slaves who committed insurrection against the ship crew.  He was the son of the founding father John Adams.  I want to own this one so progeny can see it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Perfect cover for my kindle. It makes holding the kindle easier and keeps it scratch free while I carry it in my bag.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|With the impending demise of the Google Reader, I cast about for a replacement and was happy to find feedly!  Better than happy, even!
6305428271|5.0|Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore. With idea, realism and something to really relate to.<br />Plus, it's starring Michelle Pfieffer
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Honor Harrington is my all time favorite character. David Weber did not disappoint in this installment at all, as always, I couldn't wait until I read the book, then wanted to reread it again!! So glad that it is available on Kindle now.
030746363X|5.0|I've only been on the slow carb diet for 2.5 weeks and I haven't even finished the book, but at 13 days was down 11.5 lbs (only 7 down after St. Pattys day two days ago - still)!  I am a runner and gain weight in the winter while running less/eating more.  I eventually loose it with training as it gets warmer, but it takes several months of running 30-70 miles a week.  Slow carb is the way to go and all the other information in the book seems pretty legitimate as well, I'll know more in a few weeks and could very well have ripped abs.  God bless this Timothy Ferris gentleman for the work he is doing...
B00846WWVM|5.0|This one seems to be pretty hard.  I'm stuck on the second level but am determined to advance no matter what.
B0026772N8|5.0|All time classic. Requires concentration, but well worth the effort.  Read it years ago, some of the analogies in the book are somewhat abstract.  Ultimately life affirming.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|I like how this game makes you think more and more as each puzzle progresses.  They get harder and harder.
B0026KX5PO|3.0|too slow. All the actors were good in the parts and it was a good plot line it just moved to slow.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am only at level 11 but in funtastic camera I never got my camcoins. Anyway it is completely awesome:). You should get it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Wow, I enjoyed every other Bond film ever made.  I read most of the novels.  This is the worst cinematic expression of these characters.  I was waiting for the scene where Bond and \\"M\\" might watch some Jeopardy together (action sequence).  Was there a point to shooting Bond off the train ?  I think it was to fool the stunt team.  This should be edited down to 15 minutes and then film the rest of the missing story. When I see the dvd price, I'm thinkin, You're gonna have to pay me a bunch more to watch this again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Too much advertising and not always player friendly but what can you expect when it was free but still it helps to pass the time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased WOOL on a whim and loved it.  It does a great job pulling the reader in and keeping them hooked for the whole book.  I immediately bought and read Shift after this to keep the story going.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Really, really good. The ending was perfect too. words words words words words words words words words words words words
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This thing is one of the beefiest knives out there.  If you need to beat the heck out of something this bad boy can take it.  Also it can take different handles.  I would recommend to any outdoorsman.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|After I read about 75% of the book, it began to create some interest.  Slow plot development.  Too descriptive of non-important trivia.  Wouldn't recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie but absolutely thrilled I read the book first as the author did a terrific job with the characters.  This was the type of book I could not put down!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|It will not recognize my password.  Kindle says it's a software problem, so I uninstalled it and retried to install.  No luck.  I gave up.
B00846REIS|4.0|It sort of reminded me of 50 Shades of Grey but not as exciting with the twists of 50 Shades.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As an animal lover I assumed the title was referring to the Dog - read it to find out more.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|It is hard to follow stargate sg1 but they did a good job. Season 2 really got this series going.
B009JZY3B4|5.0|This a great film to watch. I saw it accidently before one of the voyager episodes where they go back to this time. Really cool if you love star trek.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a 5star best selling book! If u haven't read it~ u lose<br />Best book in my life... that's s all I can say.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I like this trek better than the others.  I enjoy the trek stories but I'm not a big treky guy.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|It meats my needs.<br />It fits my requirements.<br />The service was very nice to work with.<br />There is no problem here.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|this game is sorta fun, accept for all the dumb ads =(  I was going to download it again on my other device, but then I found out about all the bad ads.so now I'm not.  sad face (written by my son)
0802473156|5.0|It doesn't matter what situation you're in right now. You could be single, married, in a complicated relationship, or just getting over a break-up and still needing closure, or a parent trying to understand their child. This book will help you to understand yourself and your (insert here) better. It provides you with the tools to love deeper. And you'll start to understand everyone better (friends, co-workers, parents, etc.)! Everyone should read this book. I bought this for myself so I could understand my husband better. He ended up reading it too (and he hates reading books) and recommended it to his friends. I bought a single's version for my friend and recommended it to other friends as well who bought the book. This is a must-have for your library!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It is funny for adults and for kids! My son loved the movie and I love it almost as much as he did.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  This is the best game I have on my Kindle Fire.  It is fun to play, not too hard, not too easy.  You can play as the Samuri in the classic game or as the Zombie in another game!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Season 3 - this show just gets better all the time. Great writers, stories, actors. Keep up the great work!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Many thanks to my teacher for reccomending this book to me, and I loved it. A great read, compleatly worth it.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Season 2 developed the characters and story line. Great writers, stories, actors. Thoroughly enjoy all Castle shows. Watch them over and over again.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love playing this smaller version of the Pac-Man pinball.  It reminds me of the older pinball machines years ago.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Season 4 probably my favorite so far. Ups & downs, drama & trauma, laughter & silliness. Great team of writers, directors, producers, actors. They all do a great job and I will continue to watch & purchase these shows as long as they keep 'em coming.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a good game I bought it and thought it would be so boring but I was wrong it's fun but to many ads.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Before the brilliant 'Black Holes And Revelations' Muse was relatively on the same page with their first 3 records. But starting on Black Holes And Revelations, the band began to really explore and incorporate new elements into their sound. Then The Resistance came along, which to a Muse fan was either a slap in the face or another very pleasing record, for myself, the latter. That record was beautiful in every aspect, impressively bringing even more new elements to the table. But now.....NOW we have The 2nd Law, showing the band expand EVEN FARTHER into new territory. Literally every song on the album is different from the others. Not even the last 2 instrumental tracks are in the same ballpark. More than any of their other albums, The 2nd Law stands out. All of their other records had a certain flow to them. This album has a different vibe. Since every song is different, (again, literally), a lack of a flow in the songs is created. This really isn't a bad thing at all, it's just very different from what we're used to from these guys. Basically what I'm getting to, is every song can effectively stand alone in it's own shoes. Also on this same point, you could mix around the track listing and nothing would really be taken away or affected. If you mixed around the track listing on any of their other albums it would ruin the flow. But this album would still be just as effective if you changed the track listing up.<br />I'm not going to mention highlight tracks, as I would be inclined to say all of them. But my favorite song is without a doubt, Supremacy.<br />The 2nd Law shows Muse entering new territory yet again, and the amount of experimentation here is more than any other of their albums combined.<br />For me this album is up there with Origin Of Symmetry, my favorite album of all time.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Would recommend it to anyone no matter what read this book I couldn't put it down.  It is the best boo  ever.
B00AJMTZ50|5.0|I bought this for the live discs.  I have to somewhat agree with some other reviews that the remaster mix Slowhand is a little strange.  Some of Claptons vocals were brought more forward in the mix and sound rough.  The live recording is great!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was challenging but fun.<br />Graphics are great. Tutorial was really helpful for beginners. Cinematic s were nice. Could not put it down.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have several books saved as pdf's on my original kindle that i am unable to open in this app. Thats a bummer. Otherwise i like the app
B005HSL626|4.0|I love  this app so so so much but then it won't let me open the app. Please fix this very soon.  Overall it is a great game
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great read from from john grisham. if you like crime mysteries then this is a must read. Keeps you guessing til the end
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|Part of the purpose of my kindle is to carry to help me in researching for puzzle books  that I carry with me. Do not know why, but this seemed to download and shows up on my app page. It will not, in fact,  work. Was supposed to be free but I notice that there is a charge for it in the app store.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|My dad was a trucker and when i traveled i used take large truckers atlas because i never fully trusted a gps. Why didnt someone think of this sooner
