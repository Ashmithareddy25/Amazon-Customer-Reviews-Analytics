0062238868|5|Chris Kyle is an American hero.  The Navy SEAL training is amazingly described.  Chris's devotion and commitment to other SEALs  is truly admirable.  I am eternally grateful for Kyle's service, for his love for his family, and deeply saddened by his  most unfortunate death.  My prayers go before his family.

B002ZG980U|5|This was a very cool film with a great cast. Might be hard for some people to follow because the story is complex, but the action will keep you tuned in. One thing I did not understand is how everone had enhanced abilities like fighting and high speed driving. /i think it had something to do with the ability to influence your dream, but I don't remember them ever really talking about this.
B0036O0ELM|5|Despite a few little cuts, this is the only RIGOLETTO: Callas, Gobbi, di Stefano, Serafin! There are nuances here that would even have made Verdi gasp with delight!<br /><br />What's freaky about this particular series of Warner reissues are the covers. Giant corporation Warner bought Cetra and bankrupt EMI so they now have access to *all* the Callas materials (including EMI's absolutely disgusting transfers of live performances, which are better anywhere else--especially Divina Records and even Myto). Anyway, the covers, instead of having reproduction photos from the original LPs, have little diagonal photos as we see here...of the *first* EMI CDs from1986-88! These were superb masterings which, sadly, Warner is not using, but rather, the wiry, sometimes off-pitch, badly edited versions EMI issued from 1997-2005 (this one is especially poor). Yikes. But it's all one can get new these days. The recording shines through, but look for those old 1980s EMI CDs used or better still, the old LPs.<br /><br />UPDATE: Warner's new 'Callas Remastered' CDs (2014) are generally superb!
B00HBQWGXK|2|This was painfully slow and boring to read. In fact I stopped reading it quite often and only went back to it when I was vaguely desperate for a distraction. The character is all used up....we should have been done with Reacher a few novels ago.<br /><br />Don't bother with it.
B0009VSB06|3|This is the first metal detector we've ever had.  There have been many times where we will get a strong signal, dig forever, recheck, and there is no longer anything there.  We are VERY careful when digging, so it's not that we flung the item somewhere by accident.  Also, when showing what you've found on the screen, it constantly flashes between categories.

B00005YJMX|4|Werner Herzog's remake of FW Murnau's &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is a masterpiece in its own right. It's eery, shocking, suspensful, and it contains a truly great performance by Klaus Kinski as the tortured vampire.<BR>This special edition DVD is Anchor Bay's second release of &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (it had an earlier release as a flipper.) This time, it's a two disc set, and it has new menu designs...and that's about it.<BR>The DVD looks good enough, but it looks nearly identical to the first release. The earthy colours look best in daytime. When night comes, there's some heavy grain.<BR>The extras are a marvelous audio commentary by Werner Herzog, a mediocre &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary, some eery trailers, biographies, and a little booklet with some poster art.<BR>The packaging is lovely, though
B000N2HCM4|4|Obama's multicultural background enabled him to see things he otherwise would not have been able to see. As someone with an intercultural background, I resonate with many of the observations and sentiments expressed in the book. Writing with a style of eloquent story-telling, Obama showed himself, as early as his days as a junior senator, to be a promising leader.
1400049628|5|I really enjoyed this book.  It had me in stitches from cover to cover.  Great bathroom book.  I mean that in a good way.  Recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.

B0000W3YIS|5|I was disappointed reading other people's reviews of this album. I was most angered by the disregard of tracks 7, and 8. First off, I think \\"Outrageous\\" is one of Brit's best songs, on the cd, and collected with the other 3 previous disc. Secondly I was most angered by the hate of \\"Touch Of My Hand.\\" Touch Of My Hand has absolutely nothing to do with sex or masturbation! The song is about a girl learning more about herself and having some me time\\" because she doesn't have a boyfriend. I can relate, and every other girl in the world can relate. I also don't like the constant comparison between her and Kylie Minogue. Kylie Minogue, in my opinion, is a talentless one-hit-wonder that received way too much acclaim for that childish \\"C'est La Vie\\" sounding song \\"Can't get you out of my head.\\" This is not britney's best cd as a whole, but holds a lot of her best songs. I also thought \\"The Answer\\" was a very different song, but good nonetheless. Also, \\"The Hook Up\\" was DEFINETLY NOT A FILLER SONG, BUT ONE OF HER BEST OF ALL TIME!!!!<br />Me Against The Music- 4/5<BR>I Got That Boom Boom-5/5<BR>Showdown-5/5<BR>Breathe On Me-3/5<BR>Early Mornin- 1/5<BR>Toxic-5/5<BR>Outrageous-5/5<BR>Touch Of My Hand-5/5<BR>The Hook Up-5/5<BR>Shadow-3/5<BR>Brave New Girl-0/5<BR>Everytime-5/5<BR>Remix-0/5<BR>The Answer-4/5<BR>Don't Hang Up-2/5

B0009P5YXO|4|I picked one of these up for a friend who is a big fan of Doctor Who.  I wanted to leave a review for anyone else considering it.    For starters, its $20.  No big loss of it is junk, but good thing it isn't.  Its 99% plastic with a tiny button, really tiny speaker and some wiring inside, but it does everything the prop on the show does.    In the show it looks as if the blue strip is the slider AND the button.  On this toy, the blue strip is only the button to make it light up, and only functions in the fully extended position, or fully retracted.  The slider that actually extends the light is additional, and has a big square bit that makes it easy to manipulate.    The toy comes with batteries (thank goodness) and a regular pen nib just in case you want to use it as a normal pen.  The other nib is 'invisible ink' that reacts to the near-ultra-violet LED light on the tip of the screwdriver.  Its very good at revealing its own UV ink, but isn't the correct wavelength to pick up watermarks on ID cards and on US dollars.  I was a bit disappointed about that because I thought it would be funny to check IDs with this instead of a proper ID checking light.    One of the other reviewers said the sound wasn't correct.  It may not be dead on because its produced by a very small speaker, but it sounds correct to me, and is loud enough to be heard.  Also, the UV light is quite a bit brighter than I expected, probably due to it being more towards the blue end of the light spectrum.    I would recommend this item as a gift to anyone who is a fan of Doctor Who, and also as a semi-educational toy for kids considering the UV invisible ink trick that should lead to all kinds of questions about how light works.
B009DCOU9S|4|Interesting game with an easy to follow story line...would recommend! There was enough challenges to keep you entertained and the characters were quirky and fun to meet. The graphics were pretty good,and easy . To see.<br />.
0399159347|5|Excellent blending of three women's lives with the feeling that you know each one.  Ending was a surprise and heartwrenching.
B0050DIWFC|4|This is a story well told that reflects every parent's fears and nightmares in a realistic way.  Not extraordinary language, just a well paced story.
B009MEEZXI|5|Great movie, showed it to a class of middle school students and they had many questions about autism afterwards.
B002KSPKRS|3|While the x41 are great for 5.1 Dolby Digital sound offline, it's horrible during online play. People will complain about having a reverb effect and it's completely hard to fix it due to the cheesy production of the talk-back cable. If the talk-back cable was made of higher quality parts then the reverb effect wouldn't be a problem and this product would be near perfect!
B009NX5FZU|4|Great movie
B00AZMFK3K|5|It's an awesome sci-fi movie with a great plot and lots of action :) so far the reboot of this franchise has been great and cannot wait to see if they make another one.
B000YENUI6|4|I liked this very, VERY dark and quite twisted British crime thriller about Russian mafia. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), a British-Russian midwife working at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who died in childbirth. She also finds a card from a restaurant, the Trans-Siberian. Anna sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the orphaned baby girl. The owner of the restaurant, a seemingly friendly, even charming, aged man named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) offers his help and tells his driver, a silent and grim looking man named Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), to &#34;take care&#34; of Anna and her quest... And then the film really begins.<br /><br />This 2007 film was directed by the Great Master of Freaky Twisted Thrillers himself - David Cronenberg. It is also (spiritually rather than narratively) kind of a sequel to his previous collaboration with Viggo Mortenses, the archi-famous &#34;History of Violence&#34;. For all those reasons you can reasonably expect that this film will be very dark, very violent, slightly sick and quite shocking - and those expectations will be FULLY met.<br /><br />This film offers I believe a reasonably faithful insight into the world of Russian mobsters, who mix a great pragmatism about ways they make money with some traditional customs and rituals. Those customs appeared already in the urban underworld in XIX century and were then developped and perfected even more under communism, especially in concentration camps and harshest  prisons.<br /><br />The very peculiar mentality of &#34;vory v zakonye&#34; (mobsters) is very well shown in some of the secret initiation ceremonies, in the importance of various tattoos in establishing the hierarchy amongst criminals, in the necessary respect of some taboos and in some other customs, like the one establishing that one earns more &#34;face&#34; by killing with a knife rather than with a gun (of course, only when such a deed is possible).<br /><br />The general atmosphere of the film is a very excellent thing, as good as in &#34;History of violence&#34;. All actors did very well. This film is really NOT about action scenes, but the very few which are included are great - and absolutely TERRIFYING!<br /><br />The only reason why I give this film four stars instead of five is the very ending, which I believe is a little bit too soft when compared with the rest of the film.<br /><br />That one reservation notwithstanding, this is a good, brutal, original  thriller, with many scenes which impressed and shocked me. Enjoy!4; by killing with a knife rather than with a gun (of course, only when such a deed is possible).<br /><br />The general atmosphere of the film is a very excellent thing, as good as in &#34;History of violence&#34;.

B000050XEI|2|I really liked her first two albums. I also liked her in Clannad. But now her sound is becoming a blur. I guess she has found her audience and hasn't bored them to death yet. Enya seems to still  sell albums.
B00EE3FVSU|5|This was one of the most riveting television dramas I have seen. It told a story in 8 episodes, and told it well.David Tennant and Olivia Coleman gave excellent performances. I highly recommend watching.
B00GH4R95C|4|Cool movie with lots of action.  And Amy looks great as Lois.
0439023483|5|I didn't really have high expectations for The Hunger Games.  The blurb sounded interesting, but you never can tell with young adult fiction, particularly in the science fiction genre.  Trust me:  I've been burned before.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find a compelling story with a strong, realistic protagonist.  I didn't always like Katniss, but I understood what motivated her to take the actions she did.  The story is nothing new -- comparisons to [[ASIN:156931778X Battle Royale]], [[ASIN:0451197968 The Running Man]], and even [[ASIN:0791098265 William Golding's Lord of the Flies (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)]] are all valid, but Collins's story is well-crafted, and it was difficult to put this book down.  When I reached the end, I was both pleased and dismayed to find that this was the first in a series.  Pleased because Katniss's story isn't over; dismayed because I will have to wait for the rest!
B002BJGYU8|5|I love this series, it's different from other shows, the characters set this series apart and the writing is fantastic
B002G1YPH0|5|I've had this bad boy in my i7-860 system for about 6+ weeks now....and so far it's been great.  If you need an stock HSF upgrade and don't want to spend a ton, this is a pretty good choice.<br /><br />Not sure I follow the review about it being hard to install.  Yeah, you may have to push the pins down really hard to get it to latch on properly....but it's not rocket science to figure it out.<br /><br />Right now, just running 1 fan....but thinking of hooking up a second one.  The low-volume of the 120mm fans are really nice.  You'll love it if you are use to the older and smaller fans.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the dimensions may make it difficult (or impossible) to mount on a board that is skinny.  You probably need a case that's at least 180mm wide for it to fit in ok....just an FYI!<br /><br />Yes, there are better HSF upgrades out there, though Amazon doesn't seem to sell many of them!  But you'll have to spend around a minimum of $45 or $50.  And it will only help you out a little.  All and all, 212+ is probably the best bang for the buck HSF you can buy right now.
B005MMY534|5|I loved this series. I have always enjoyed stories and movies based on the King Arthur legends. Camelot Season 1 had wonderful actors. Each episode was exciting and made me wanting to watch the next. I was very sad that there was no Season 2.
B0024F13NC|5|Classic album. Always good to hear their old rock. Definitely one to add to your collection. Worthwhile if you don't already have it.
6305428042|5|What can I say Hocus Pocus  very fun movie. It is one of my favorite Halloween movies. I'm glad you had it on Amizon for sale.
B00L9B7IKE|5|One of the best books I have ever read (said my wife who read it).
B00KY7PEAA|2|I would have preferred a solo play version as Kindle 7 screen too small for interactive chat (which looked a little pointless when I viewed two player's texts) Graphics looked great, that is what drew me in. But not really easy to understand what first screen wanted for setup and lost interest quickly. Game deleted.
B00A0SO4S6|5|I have watched this many times over the years and enjoy it each time.  This is a go-to movie when I want an intriguing, suspenseful film for a lazy afternoon or evening.
B003AQBYUG|5|Excellent buy!  Get the import and save the $$$.  Exception product for the money.  So many extras in the set.  2 discs of behind the scenes footage.  Simply amazing to watch everything about all Alien films.
B00LTI56AQ|3|I have a Generation 2 Kindle, the 2009 model.  When I saw that this cover was for 'Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch', I assumed that it would fit my five year old model.  It does not, it is too small.  I was very disappointed by this - I would like to have a cover for my very satisfactorily functioning device and have only been able to locate a slip case rather than an actual cover for it.  If it had just fit my Kindle this would have been just what I was looking for, sturdy, well made etc.  Too bad that who ever wrote the description for this wasn't more clear about which models this fit.
0441009425|5|This is the kind of hard sci-fi that really speaks to me!<br /><br />In my opinion, Alastair Reynolds is like a cross between Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan, and Neal Stephenson.<br /><br />I just started \\"Redemption Ark\\" and it appears to be more of the same awesomeness!  I can't wait to tear through his entire collection.
B00NWLIW0E|5|This is the best game ever. You unlock new goats you have roof top party's.
B008Y1YK0I|4|Good movie but quite long for my taste.
0312360266|1|I hated this book. Has EVERYTHING in it one would not expect to find in a TEEN novel. Sex, cursing and everything one would need detailed to perform a wiccan ceremony! There is NO WAY if I had a teenage daughter I'd let her read these books.
B00992CF6W|5|this game is awesome it has so much to do. my cousin built a mansion and to get there you have to travel through woods and I have it and play it every day you should see my create world it is full of houses buildings statues and more if you don't like it I think you should
B008XG1X18|5|Love this. I have found so many great things on this app!
B00H4M3GXK|5|Good flick.
B0002BO0AS|5|this has to be my metal-core album of the year, i dont know if anything else thats coming out can beat it...maybe lamb of gods new relase ashes of the wake when it comes out, but wow.....this band and album are amazing.....im glad tehy went more metal with this album, but still kept the breakdowns, they add so much more to the songs. there isnt one \\"bad\\" track on here, but of course, i have my faves.....1, 3,4,5,6,7,8, is usually what i always listen to when i pop this cd in. there others are okay too. if u like hardcore, u are sure to appreciate this, if u like metal, u will apperciate this even more.....best metal-core band there is right here, great live show too
B0054JZC6E|4|There is a game for everyone. The only downside is that you have to play the ones you don't like as well just to get access to other games. All in all I would recommend this app.
B004I744AS|5|Get rid of all your other dictionaries this one is great ,besides being a  dictionary it has some side fun stuff
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Even though I had at least fourteen days to read this novel I found myself unable to put it down. Hopeless is definitely a great book. It does not stick to pure happiness, it also shows pain, hopelessness, and sadness. This book is deep, and displays events that are realistic. Though at some parts I dreaded reading, it just made the experience far greater. Definitely a good read.
B002PZ6XB8|4|Highly recommended view for preparing to visit the Lake District of England! Beautiful film with excellent acting and engaging characters. The depiction of Beatrix Potter's imaginative illustrations is endearing.
B002MQYOFW|5|Warning!! Hard to put this book down after the first few pages. Make sure you start it on a weekend or you might be phoning in 'sick' to work.
B000SO7OL6|5|Great product.
B001AQO3XS|4|I love Highlander.  I watched this movie as a kid, loved the series, and even went to watch the lackluster sequels.  Highlander has a special place in my heart.  That being said, Highlander is very odd to talk about in terms of quality.<br /><br />First off, the story is great.  One of the things I always say about a good sci fi/fantasy tale is that it's wrapped in mythology that the creators only touch on.  That's why Highlander is great.  Sure there are flashbacks.  But one of the things that keep viewers coming back to Highlander was where did these immortals come from?  What about the rest of their stories?  That's really why the first one works and the rest of the movies fail.  It's wrapped in mythology only giving us snippets about the past.<br /><br />So that being said, what about the movie?  Well it has a lot of great elements.  The leads are great in their roles.  I'll never say either Christopher Lambert or Clancy Brown are the best actors ever, but Lambert's nondescript accent works as a man who has lived forever and everywhere.  Clancy Brown is the most awesome villain ever as the Kurigan.  Troubling as it is, the scene in the church where the Kurigan says, &#34;Forgive me father, I am a worm,&#34; encapsulates the pure evil of this character.  And Sean Connery is just great.<br /><br />The story works because it's a classic tale of good and evil.  It's sprinkled with some neat camera work, due in no small part to the fact that Russel Mulchay was a graduate of music video directing.  The segues between the flashbacks and present day are perfect and became a hallmark of all future incarnations of Highlander.  Then there's the music of Queen, cool sword fighting, and great one liners like, &#34;It's a kind of magic,&#34; and, &#34;There can be only one!&#34;<br /><br />So why do I reduce the review by one star.  Well, with all that's great, it's hard to ignore the campiness of the movie and the fact that it has some really bad dialogue and acting in it.Leads aside, the supporting players leave much to be desired.  The whole police was ripped from Police Squad.  There's a helicopter scene where MacLeod and the Kurigan leave from a sword fight and the police in the helicopter just say, &#34;Hey. Come back here.&#34;  It's comical.  The unintentional camp factor is great for a laugh, but does rob from some of the great aspects of the movie.  It's a small enough complaint that it doesn't ruin the replay value.  Though a warning to new viewers: It can seem a little dated at times.<br /><br />Extras on the Blu Ray are hold overs from the DVD.  The HD transfer is great.  My only gripe is there are a set of slideshow extras detailing facts about production.  One of the little snippets contained photos and info about footage that had been destroyed. Why they didn't add this info to the bluray is beyond me.  I guess you can google it.<br /><br />That being said.  Pick this up!  Watch the Highlander series!  Stay away from the movies, especially Highlander 2.  Buy Queen's &#34;A Kind of Magic&#34; album.  All great stuff.  And remember, there can be only one!  Had to say it...
B000005RT8|4|I am a HUGE Macca fan--and I would likely listen to him sing the phone book, yet I somehow never appreciated this album until now. To be fair, I was only 17 when it came out--I pretty much played \\"Coming Up\\" and \\"Waterfalls\\" and that was it. I didn't \\"get\\" the electronic music and wanted him to be rockin' out. With the arrival of the CD, my vinyl copy got put away and I never managed to purchase the CD version. Then last year at Paul's Hollywood Bowl Concert, I realized that the cool music playing before the show was from this album and I was really digging it. So I dusted off that ol' vinyl copy and gave it another spin. I don't know if I have simply matured in my musical tastes or this album was twenty years ahead of its time, but it sounds so fresh. Different than his Fireman efforts, which I also like. \\"Bogey Music\\" is a laff--like something John would have done. \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a cool bass-driven rocker. Also love \\"Check My Machine\\", \\"Front Parlour\\" and \\"Frozen Jap\\". \\"Temporary Secretary\\" seems like something Devo or the B-52s might have done. \\"Blue Sway\\" is beautiful and ethereal. \\"Waterfalls\\" is a classic Macca ballad, as is \\"One of These Days\\". \\"Summer's Day Song\\" is also quite pretty.    The most \\"out there\\" songs, \\"All You Horse Riders\\", \\"You Know I'll Get You Baby\\" and \\"Bogey Wobble:\\" were left off the album, but are pretty cool electronica themselves. You can find them on \\"The Lost McCartney II Album\\".    BTW, none other than John Lennon said he liked this album :)
B00E8KLWB4|4|The game itself if fun. Having to wait extended periods to play sucks.
B00CQHZ2LW|5|My granddaughter loves it and it is one of many &#34;Frozen&#34; toys she now has received for her B-day.
B001UV4XIS|5|I had a great experience.All my expectations were filled.The purchase arrive timely at the agreed time.The product arrived in good condition.<br />Thanks!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved this book. I knew once It said &#34;An Imperial Affliction&#34; ended in the middle of a sentence that this would end Incompletely. I am upset it ended this way, I was not surprised though. I would recommend this book to readers with a understanding of high level words. What happens to Hazel ? Was she too sick to go on ? Is there an afterlife for her and Augustus ? Or is there just a capital S something ? What happens to Hazel's parents if she dies? I won't ever know.
B003F3FJQO|5|The best book ever i will forever be in love with James Dashner's books!!!! <3 Cant wait to read book three :D
B001HN6922|5|I am a mom of a 3 year old and I loved it more then the first.  Which I really liked the first!
0307279189|5|This is the best book about running I've read- it beats Dean, Pam and Running through the wall.  Like Chris McDougall  and most other runners I've been plagued with many injuries and have had my longest layoff in my running career these past 2 years. I also work and sell products within the running industry so the information in this book was especially meaningful and eye opening! Guaranteed to change the way you think and not just about running...     Runners beware- you'll want to ditch those running shoes, sign up for an ultra marathon, buy pinole and geranium extracts on Amazon to create a diet like the Tarahumara. What a great read. I am so happy I finally read this book!
B0071XO8RA|4|premise, setting and plot development original and creative. characters interesting. dialogue redundant sometimes with overuse of Certain words or phrases.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Read the book.. If Stephen King is your read of choice you will not be disappointed. Beginning to end i couldnt put it down
B00HGJ18C2|3|Could do without the ads but otherwise not bad it passes the time especially when your sitting on a plane.....
B006MW3V6U|5|Great  enjoyable.  I loved it. Looking forward to watching the next several seasons.
B000002O03|5|Pronounced is the best American Band released CD in 1973, (Darkside of the Moon by a British Band).  Most people look at Free Bird and just assume it is good, but it is not good, it is great.  &quot;I Ain't the One&quot; is a great rocker, &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; is a great bluesy type tune.  Gimme Three Steps&quot; everyone has heard this one. &quot;Simple Man&quot; is the best song on the album.  &quot;Things Goin' On&quot;  is one of the best singalong songs ever, great lyrics.  &quot;Mississippi Kid&quot; is also great, for God's sake it has a mandolin in it.  &quot;Poison Whiskey&quot;  is the second best track on the whole CD.  &quot;Free Bird&quot; well, it's Free Bird. The most requested song in FM radio history.  Sell your dog to buy this.
0440234743|5|I have read (or listened to) all of Grisham's books. The testament was fantastic. The underlying theme of REDEMPTION is bold and strong.

B003YL4LYI|4|the song of fire and ice begins the resolution of this epic saga. the characters are all well crafted, and the intrigue haunting. the story continues to have surprising twists that leaves the reader on the edge of their seat begging for more.

B00005JLXE|1|This movie  is one of the worst  superhero films ever. Ben Afleck  besides being a mediocre  actor  could  not save this movie. It is a  flick based on  a  fine  story but was turned into  rubish. Sorry to say but   the whole film was so  cheesy I could not wait to the end of  it. BAD acting  mixed with terible  directing.
B00BJS7LHC|5|I really enjoyed this movie!  I thought the actors were great.  Jamie Foxx is a really cool dude.  Christoph Waltz was smart and sympathetic.  Leonardo DiCaprio was pure evil.  And Samuel L Jackson was not far behind Leonardo!  The music fit the different sections of the movie beautifully.  It kept me glued to my seat.  Not one false note!  There is bad language, a little nudity, a LOT of violence, so not appropriate for young children.
B0060LYL30|5|I don't care what people say this movie is a classic! Every part of it, class soundtrack too!
B00DV2D0JC|5|This game is fantastic and super fun.  I can't believe how much fun it is.  I don't want to put it down...  you won't regret getting this gem..<br />I am a grandmother and I love this game...  do yourself a favor and get this game. Now now now lol...
B00N1JQ2UO|2|Has anyone seen the 3D bluray version yet? I tried 3D version last night and it was quiet bad.  This one was quite off with no sense of the 3D presentation. Only the background that was unfocused was in &#34;3D&#34; but truly awful. I tried playing with parallax setting and switching to side to side/ top bottom vs auto. Was giving headache. Had to switch to regular version. All other 3D blu rays work fine. Gravity was exceptional last week.<br /><br />Let me know if others have this issue so I can blame my system.  (Oppo 93/JVC RS 45/ Xpand 3D 104 glasses)<br /><br />Thanks.
B00005LOUP|5|Fun, different and wonderful family movie! We also love the music :-) Great entertainment for the season for all of us!
0887306667|5|This is a great book. Al Ries and Jack Trout have done it again. These are the laws of Marketing - Immutable laws to say the least. I really enjoyed reading this, and highlighting the most important parts that I could use or gain something from. I would like to introduce you to 4 laws that were described, that I found quite interesting.<br />The Law of Mind (Law 3)\\"Thousands of would-be entrepreneurs are tripped up every year by this law. Someone has an idea or concept he or she will revolutionize an industry, as well it may. The problem is getting the idea or concept into a prospects mind.\\".<br />The Law of Perception (Law 4)\\"The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion. Marketing is a Manipulation of these perceptions. Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products.\\"<br />The Law of Perspective (Law 11)\\"Many companies find they need a quartely dose of couponing to keep sales on an even keel. Any sort of couponing, discounts, or sales tends to educate consumers to buy only when they can get a discount.<br />The Law of Acceleration (Law 21)\\"Successful programs are not built on fads, they're built on trends. But the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend. This is a law I will always try to remember.<br />I really enjoyed this Marketing book. Please have a read - it will increase your knowledge of this main area of business in today's global, brand-orientated, complicated market-place.<br />Cheers - Vaughan Allison<br />PS. I'm off to read Marketing WAR-FARE!
B002XMGGJM|5|Great movie
B000FDFVZ6|5|This story was very touching. It goes from extreme tragedy to dealing with everyday life with perfection. Highly recommended
B000002KGT|4|I used to think this was the greatest rock/pop album ever made.  However, as the years go by, and we learn about more musicians and bands out there, what we once considered some of the best music we've ever heard gradually falls by the wayside as our minds begin to realize this isn't the ONLY good pop rock worth listening to.  Rumours is a perfect example.      While not the best Fleetwood Mac album (I prefer the Peter Green period more because of his brilliant guitar playing) nobody can deny the songwriting is quite strong and melodic, and most of the songs will immediately sound familiar to those of you (fortunate) enough to not tune in to the radio every often.  For those of you who DO listen to the radio all the time, you're probably sick of most of these songs, and rightfully so.    So yeah, it's a good enough album filled with plenty of good, recognizable songs.  As for some other (better) pop bands of the 70's, check out bands like 10cc, Big Star, Be Bop Deluxe, Electric Light Orchestra, and Badfinger.  These artists are very talented and it's hard to believe they aren't more well-known among classic rock fans.  You can change that though, by giving them a chance.
B002GOAH1U|4|.....a movie just like this that every time it comes on you always manage to watch at least a part of it.  This is not a great movie, some of the casting is questionable, many of the jokes fall flat, the pratfalls are pitifully contrived but for some reason, it all seems to come together to make this one of those movies like Ghost, Mrs. Doubtfire and Dirty Dancing that doesn't seem to have a saturation point in how many times you can view it.  I think the reason it succeeds is due to the story itself.  Daphne, a teenage girl played by Amanda Bynes runs off to England to meet the father she never knew and who never knew of his daughter's existence. Of course, Daddy isn't some average Joe but a Lord who is moving up in the world of politics.  Also included are an evil fiancee and an equally evil soon to be stepsister.  Of course, there is a charming young man she meets along the way.  My only complaint about this movie is that it takes place only a few years ago and  while it can be said that Americans invented rock and roll (some 50 years ago), the ridiculous notion that only the American Daphne can save an otherwise stuffy party by asking the band to play a James Brown song which rescues the party from an otherwise certain bore fest is quite arrogant.  London has rocked and rolled for a long time.  Yes, I guess I can find all sorts of things wrong, but I know the next time I see it on TV, I'll check in for at least a few minutes.
B00UENHBAU|5|My teens love it :)
B00FPH6AXE|3|It had some suspense in the beginning but the overall movie was about Will and his son and how they connected and survived on a foreign planet.
B007IV1E2W|5|My daughter and I love watching Doctor Who! It just keeps getting better and better! We look forward the episodes!
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book is a real eye opener. It makes you really think about the world and your life. I would recommend this book to all young adult and teen readers. Absolutely amazing.
B00005JKC3|1|But I wouldn't be surprised if it sells enough dvd's to make a profit. A somewhat confused plot, overlong action scenes & outrageous over-acting. Add to that a poor edit job. The fight sequence between the dogs & The Hulk seemed to take forever. The special effects were cheesy. I'm stupid. I sat through the whole thing. Rate this one D for mindless drivel. <br />
0345440927|5|Such a wonderful little &#34;bible&#34;! I gave it to several couples with toddlers who rule their world!  Tracy Hogg explains the guilt parents feel in learning to discipline.  She helps them know that love and respect for your child is paramount.  Each child has a personality NOT the same as their parent.  Tracy offers us all a way to understand , communicate, and guide a younger child!!!
B007J4T2G8|1|Nope!
B00DRPVE3M|2|Shameful how they try to nickel and dime you at every turn to play this game. This is not Candy Crush--meaning I can buy a deck of Uno cards and play all I want. Why on EARTH would I keep pumping money into this app which is a simple card game?? Unbelievable...
B000002C4J|5|Celine Dion has produced fine recordings since her debut in 1990 with &quot;Unison&quot;. Recently, her new albums &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; and &quot;One Heart&quot; haven't matched her previous works, by far. And they don't come anywhere near this album. <br />Released in 1997, this album was a little underestimated until the release of the number one hit &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. <br />After the song became overplayed and overhyped, I bought this album. I found the unreleased singles were much better. By far, the best track is Immortailty. It shows the softer side to Celine, not the Celine that just explodes with high notes. Songs like Why oh Why do travel down the hip hop side. It seems that she has combined many genres, from classical, to hip hop, to pop, to altertative, nothing is out of boundaries for this incredilbe artist, whom I was lucky to see in concert. <br />As far as the strong tracks, there are few weak tracks. Miles to Go Before I Sleep shouldn't have made the cut on this album. Just A Little Bit of Love became quite annoying. <br />Overall, the great tracks make up for this. She takes her inspirations from Barbara Streisand, and great vocals from Carole King and Michael Jackson as well as Mariah Carey. <br />This is the best album she has released!<br />Buy It, you won't regret it. <br />As a matter of fact, I loved it so much, i have two copies, well I lost the first one.
B00CP2Z5TC|5|This album is a slight change of sound for VW with the exception, pretty much, of Step and I think this change is mostly for the good.  If you're looking for the regular VW sound or if you don't like Paul Simon (since it seems like that was where the change came - in other words, they sound a little like Paul Simon), you'll probably be a little disappointed.
B00MBEF1G6|5|bummed that all the Dr Panda games released at mid 2014 (as well as all the new ones in 2015) are not compatible anymore with the orig 2013 KINDLE FIRE?  Shame since my daughter (age 5) has been playing them now for the last 3 years and still loves them (i'm giving the app 5 stars since all the ones she does love are high quality, but i reality I have no idea)
B00164KYV4|1|I am going to do my best to write a proper review for this flick BECAUSE I HATE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. And I want to share that hate with you.    We open with giant bubble of perkiness Gennifer Goodwin as Gigi as a child, with her older self giving a voice-over. She is a young girl on a playground, and a boy comes over to her and shoves her to the ground. She runs crying to her mother, and her mother says the boy did it because he likes her. Gigi then speculates that this is what screws with so many women's heads and messes with them later in life, because they come to associate bad behavior by men with affection. We then join Gigi as an adult at the end of a date with Conor, this totally bland yuppie. He says he'll give her a call and she gets excited when she sees him taking his cell phone out, but he calls Scarlett Johansson as Anna. She tells him she doesn't want to get together just then, and gets ridiculously excited over this cooler she won [it's depressing to see Scarlett Johansson have to act so stupid], and flirts with the guy behind her in line, Ben. He's a music producer and she's an aspiring singer, but he tells her he can't hear from her, because he's married... to Jennifer Connelly as Janine, who works in the same office as Gigi and Jennifer Aniston as Betsy, at some magazine [this is the Cosmopolitan magazine version of life, in which everyone works at a magazine or is a yoga instructor or a music producer]. Betsy has been living with Ben Affleck as Neil for seven years, but he doesn't want to get married because he doesn't believe in marriage. Which, in this movie, is less preferable to being a Satanist, say, or a leper. Oh, and by the way, all of this is supposedly happening in Baltimore. Have you ever BEEN to Baltimore?    So Gigi starts obsessing over Conor calling, although we have no evidence that they had any particular chemistry or connection. She waits for him to call, staring at her phone at work! In the shower! At her yoga class! Janine advises her on when to call and for how long. Soon she's planning on just \\"stopping by\\" a place he said he sometimes frequents in order to engineer a run-in with him. The majority of the first half-hour here is made up of Gigi growing more obsessive about whether Conor, who you will recall she met once, will call, with her entire sense of self-worth apparently hanging in the balance. It gets to the point where she really does seem to be the badly-damaged shell of what once was a human being. She does go to the restaurant he said he frequents, where she ends up meeting his friend, Alex, played by Justin Long, who apparently runs the place. He came out to help at the bar, as they were super busy, but apparently has time to just sit around and talk to Gigi all night. He tells her flat-out that Conor will never call, because--can you guess?--He's Just Not That Into Her. Alex will be the one to deliver the major bullet points of the self-help book this is adapted from for the remainder of the movie. He also tells her that too many women hear what amounts to urban legends about women who didn't give up on a guy, and finally he relented and they got married. He says too many women think that they'll be \\"the exception\\" when in fact they are \\"the rule.\\" Gigi seems over Conor the next day at work--where apparently their jobs consist of sitting around and obsessing over relationships.    SPOILERS > > > Meanwhile, Ben has decided that there's no harm in flirting with Anna, and calls her. This involves him smoking cigarettes on the sly, which he tries, through several scenes and numerous lies, to keep from his wife, Janine. The issue slowly starts to gnaw at her sanity, as she knows something is wrong, but Ben won't admit it. There is a bizarre scene in which she accuses Luis Guzman's contractors of smoking while they work on renovating their house. Once it's revealed that Ben actually is smoking, she says \\"What part of `my father died of lung cancer' is so hard for you to understand?\\" as though her personal trauma gives her license to completely control his life. Eventually he comes clean that he had an affair, expecting her to simply dump him, then surprised that she wants to talk about it and work it out. Janine blames herself. It must be said that this is the only thread of the movie that feel in any way genuine, as Jennifer Connelly is able to bring some real, grounded emotion to it.    Meanwhile Betsy grows more and more upset that Neil won't marry her, despite his repeated assurances that he loves her, and doesn't believe in marriage on ideological grounds. Idi-a-whatdicalogical grounds? Janine says. When Alex gives Gigi the advice that if a guy hasn't married you after two years, he isn't going to marry you, Betsy goes home and tells Neil that \\"she needs him to not be nice to her if he isn't going to marry her.\\" This is the sort of \\"kooky\\" statement that some women apparently think is adorable [this movie made me really glad not to be straight]. Anyway, despite the fact that their relationship is going swimmingly, Betsy \\"Can't do this\\" and breaks up with Neil for not marrying her. In here we briefly see Drew Barrymore in a tiny part that has no relation to anything. Nevertheless, Drew produced the film, so special scorn must be heaped on her.    So some of the corollary advice to \\"if a man hasn't married you... he's not going to marry you\\" that Alex gives Gigi is that \\"If a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you.\\" This casts the whole situation as that all women are desperate for men to call, and are delighted to hear from and date any man, while men are completely in control of the situation, and can choose to call the woman back or not, as they like. If they want to see a woman, the woman WILL see them. I'm sure several men out there would be quite surprised to find out that this is the case. Anyway, Gigi shows that she has actually not grown beyond her desperate yearning for a boyfriend above all else, only altered the context of her delusions, as she starts to believe that Alex is secretly in love with her, and has been telling her this in code all along. She accepts his invitation to a party as the fruition of their secret passion, and finally makes an ill-advised move on him.    He tells her that no, he is actually not secretly in love with her, causing her to deliver a withering character assessment about how he just uses people and never really connects to anyone, concluding \\"You have not won. You're alone, Alex.\\" We'll leave until later discussion of WHAT Gigi could possibly mean by classifying the entire issue into \\"winning\\" and \\"losing,\\" with finding companionship [regardless of with who?] definitively posed as \\"winning.\\"    Okay, time to arbitrarily stop the movie and wrap everything up! Time's up, folks! Betsy and Neil get back together! And guess what? He proposes in a cute, TV-movie way, and they get married! Mary [that's Drew] and Conor get together! Anna has a singing gig [i.e. she hasn't found a relationship, but she's on her way to pursuing her dream]! Janine and Ben, surprise, break up, and she moves out! And Gigi's harsh character assessment was exactly what Alex needed to realize that goll-darn it, she's right! And in fact, she is the very woman he must spend the rest of his life with! They've WON. < < < SPOILERS END    The primary emotion this movie evokes is sadness for people who view relationships this way, and the people who will watch this movie and feel that they must adopt to these standards in order to find a relationship, and hence to \\"win.\\" Gigi is a character clearly in need of several years of reparative therapy for her wildly distorted view of her own value and human relationships, yet the movie tries to coast on a \\"We're all like this, deep inside!\\" vibe. The pathetic obsession she develops over whether Conor will call her is embarrassing and sad, not adorable. Her lack of insight developed through the film--she simply switches fantasy-based obsession with Conor for fantasy-based obsession with Alex--is also disheartening. Yet the film has no criticism of her, it holds her up as a model for the winning strategy of being sincere and open to people, which apparently trumps all other characteristics--like, say, wisdom or intelligence. By the time she indicates that for her, being partnered is \\"winning\\" and being alone \\"losing,\\" one pities her distorted view of relationships, but the point of the view of the movie is that this is pretty much the way things are.    Betsy is blind to the attributes of her relationship, and only the public validation of a wedding can make it real to her. At which point she can begin looking forward to the next milestone, having a baby [as Janine wishes to do], with an option to also achieve wonderful completions of self such as renovating one's fabulous loft! Really, you should receive two free issues of Cosmopolitan with your ticket purchase, which will convert to a full subscription unless you cancel.    The movie really is disconcerting and uncomfortable in the way that it suggests that all women are wholly mentally preoccupied with guys, whether a guy will call, whether they'll have a relationship [they'll WIN!], and then get married, then renovate the loft, then have a baby! After that, I suppose life ends? Or I think perhaps you flip into being the bitter wife whose husband likes younger women but its okay because you have the credit card to acquire shoes and redo the house again? While watching the movie I kept wondering at the mindset--and set-up for disappointment--that people who share this film's worldview must have. I mean, WHAT is going to happen after you've finally scored that relationship? After you've \\"won?\\" And most of all, after one has married, that ultimate milestone and validation of all that is you! Most films end with marriage and don't bother to show what comes after, but this one really egregiously sets that up as the ultimate prize, to the point where one begins to worry about the people that might be taken in by this viewpoint. We all know that one person who just keeps talking about having a relationship, and their new strategy for getting a relationship, and how their main focus is on finding a relationship, and after a while you want to say \\"Um, what do you think is going to HAPPEN when you find this mythical relationship? You're going to be delivered into some blissful state of endless nirvana and never have any other concerns or problems again?\\" Because like those people, this movie just kind of makes you WORRY for those people that have this distorted viewpoint, and wish that somehow they could just undergo a complete, ground-up change of mind.    Let's again underscore this film's view of women as vacuous bundles of emotional need who seem unable or unwilling to process anything that doesn't have to do with DATING! And superficial symbols of personal validation such as someone thinking one is cute or calling one back. The irony is that this is positioning itself so heavily as a \\"chick flick,\\" and to be supportive of women, when in fact it is painting them as neurotic and shallow strivers with significantly warped self-images, lacking any secure sense of self [except that which they think they should SEEM to have in order to be more DATABLE!] and desperate for the validation of any fleeting attention from even the most unsuitable of men. It's just sad, more than anything! Talk about the five-hankie weeper of the year. OH, and by the way, this is apparently supposed to be a \\"comedy.\\"    Really, I don't understand why feminists weren't burning theaters down when this was out.    The ultimate betrayal this movie is guilty of is devoting two hours to trying to strip women of their delusions about romance and get them to accept that the \\"fairy tale\\" ending they yearn for is not a reality--then end is such a way that nearly all the characters achieve that magical, surprise fairy tale ending! And like in the fairy tale, it leaves the women in the audience, the ones in supposedly supports, with the old \\"they lived happily ever after\\" and doesn't bother to include what might happen as these people continue to live their lives. But whatever, they've \\"WON!\\"    This is one of those things where one feels that the director, Ken Kwapis, and the screenwriters, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, really need to be exiled to a desert island, where they can inflict no more damage on society. You will need chemical decontamination after this film and women, please do not let your daughters watch this damaging film.    SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?  There really are no circumstances under which that is advisable--except maybe in a college women's studies class.
B000HC2LIK|4|This is one of those flicks you must watch more than once.  Harrison Ford is good in this.  But the most important thing about this movie isn't the storyline because it doesn't develop THAT well.  But the most important part of this movie is the music and scenery.  The idea is pretty good too.  I can't give it 5 stars because I almost had to force myself to finish.  Almost.  Which was another downer; The Ending.  It just kind of stops outta know where.  It leaves some unanswered questions.  Overall though, it's worth seeing, even buying for the low price it is at now.

B002361MLA|5|I'm understanding a lot of how the mind works, I'm learning to disconnected my emotions from myself. This is a life changing book.
0425170349|4|This selection by Tom Clancy was an excellent read.  Like most of Clancy's books it started off a little slow for me but in the end was a book I would recommend to anyone interested in this type of literature. Even if you have never read anything by Clancy this is one that would be good to start off with, it is full of action and adventure, just be sure you have enough time to sit down and read it within a rather short period of time.  If you read only a chapter or two every two weeks or so like a friend of mine did then you will not get the true effect of the book because you forget so much information and have to go back and re-read the previous chapter just to remember where you were.
B006IYG5HE|4|Well thought out mystery had me guessing most of the way through the book.  Plausible events with enpugh surprises to keep you reading
B00000JGOH|3|This is a pretty funny movie, but I don't understand why it won for best picture.
B000AP04MO|5|Yes, it's an old movie with effects and acting skills that aren't up today's generation of  what's a &#34;good movie.&#34;  I however found it be an adorable film with both lovable and not so lovable characters,(hint- hint the bratty child. lol ) Audrey Hepburn was as beautiful as ever and I couldn't help but think through the entire film, how much a young Albert Finney reminded me of today's Ewan McGregor.  The movie had a good plot and I loved how it flashed back throughout the character' s relationship bringing them up to present. It's definitely a classic and a must for your Hepburn or Finney collection!!
B00BD99JMW|3|First, I want to say that I loved this series as a whole. I loved the premise and the psychological implication of factions and the idea that some are better than other based on genes.<br /><br />To me, this 3rd book was about evolving...personally, societally, and politically. I think the author did a good job with that. The characters were not in the same immature or naive place that they were in their lives in the first two books. That is very apparant as the book goes on and they are forced to see that they no longer live in the world they thought they did.<br /><br />I actually liked the story and liked the conclusion. I thought it all flowed and made sense.<br /><br />The reason for my 3 star review is the writing. As a 46 year old, I really don't expect stellar writing from YA literature, but this just didn't seem to be as well written as the first two.<br /><br />I also could not stand the chapters going back and forth between Tris and Tobius. I can't remember if the first two books were like this, but I don't remember it having bothered me if it was. The storyline went in a way that it could not have just been from Tris' point of view, but I would have rather had it written in the third person.<br /><br />To conclude, I am very surprised at the extreme 1 star reviews.  I think they must have been a visceral reaction from many people at how the story played out.

0783226845|5|Excellent movie!  Not a chick flick - great for both men and women.  Highly recommend this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Although some of the scenes in Season 3's episodes were a little dull, on the whole I continue to be a fan of DA.  Those scenes that were a little dull in the script were offset by the acting, costumes, and scenery, which has always been excellent.  I continue to highly recommend DA and look forward to Season 4.  My only comment to the powers that be, make it possible for the US fans to see the broadcasts sooner than later.

B00BHMETKC|2|This movie fell down completely for me.<br />Arkin and Goodman were just caricatures, though intended to be satirical of Hollywood.<br />As far as \\"taut, suspenseful movie-making\\" goes there are many in this genre that are superior.<br />It never left Hitchcock behind.<br />And the unfortunate tendency of script writers in our era to use so many four letter words is a reflection of their inability to write intelligent dialogue.<br />If everyone tosses out profanity in every situation, men and women alike, from those in the White House to those down on the ground, that is just a way NOT to write a literate, involving script for me.<br />It's formulaic and hardly makes the characters seem grittier or more sympathetic.<br />Do all tough guys swear so much?<br />What if Bourne or Bond tossed off so many lines with the obligatory profanity?<br />At best this is just generic film-making I am afraid, displaying no originality and utilizes the cliches of other recent and popular films to underwhelming effect.

But if you do install it prepare to need to speak to a technician to uninstall it during service hours, it's that integraited.
B007IXWKUK|4|So much fun to read.  Fall in love with the life of Grey.  I could read this over abd over.
B004S5D3B6|5|True story of a determined young fighter challenged by the crazy dynamics of his family, language a little heavy though entertaining tale. The acting was superb particularly Christian Bale, he was fabulous.
B007FTZDN8|5|I can listen all day.  It is like intellectual web surfing.  I love having people who know the subject, present in an understandable way, while not dumbing it down.  What the internet should have more of.
B00BMT9C84|3|rueful laughter, easy to identify with the situations and mother-son dynamics. Maybe it is time for a road trip. Don't forget to pack sandwiches.
B00BESLHEA|1|First let me say I love King Fu movies, from great to cheesy I love them. I also love Quentin Tarantino and have seen several films from his proteges, but this movie was truly awful.<br /><br />I didn't even make it past 1/2 hour, and ended up watch reruns of Californication.<br /><br />If this movie becomes part of the free catalog, then ok I guess you only loose your time - but don't pay to see this crap.
1607882302|3|Tony Hsieh is a very smart and very rich man.  As an occasional customer of Zappos, I decided to read his book.  His focus on quality and building a corporate culture made sense, but in the end I was left with three puzzles:<br /><br />* His writing is extremely opaque.  Any people he mentions are like cardboard figures - father, mother, partner - he never tells anything personal about any person.  Once in the book he mentions \\"my significant other\\" but nothing who that person might be and what they are like.  Seems friendly but tells you nothing<br />* In describing the sale of Zappos to Amazon he says that announcing a 40% bonus to employees let to a mass celebration by people who would now be able to take their kids to Disneyland or afford a medical procedure.  Hello, Mr Benefactor of Humanity and the carrier of happiness - what about health insurance and pay levels?  People who work for you have to wait for a once-in-a-decade bonus to afford medical care?<br />* The bonus chapter in the audiobook contained a long interview.  While advertised as spontaneous, major chunks of it were word-for-word repeats of the book, creating an impression that the author has a script that he keeps repeating as he crafts his public image.<br /><br />Something in that whole story did not fit.  While I do not regret having read this book, I'm left puzzled...
032147404X|3|I have read this book thoroughly and while it does give SOME information, I would have preferred there to be MORE information.  Under the picture on each page there are general suggestions on how to achieve that picture however, I would have definitely preferred information such as; \\"for this picture I used blah blah setting, blah blah exposure etc.,\\" and the pros and cons of not using other settings.  The quote on the front of the book states 'The step-by-step secrets for how to make your photos look like the pros', and I have to say that that ISN'T what the book does.  There is no step-by-step anything, just vague ideas.  I gave this book three stars because of the scant information it gives but as a 'beginner' in Digital Photography with a Nikon D40 this book hasn't helped me at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Been waiting long time for kindle to get this game. It can be so frustrating especially when you can't see the jellies and at times.as it suddenly ends when moves are still available.
B00CSYRHG6|5|Love it and it had everything in it to remind you its an Miyazaki movie.....? Even if it was only from his Son but under the watchfull eye from the Great Hayao Miyazaki.....? His Critic was a bit harsh to his Sons Work ( Special Feature ) but he is the Grandmaster....? Its an simple Story but with soo much Heart and Love to put into it ....? I really like it a lot......? Picture and Sound are just Perfect Storyline just befor the 60s Japan Olympics......? Watch and enjoy it.....?
B000059HAI|5|With a focus on the story instead of people, heros or whatever Perl Harbor the movie tried to do, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a much better source of information about the time before and just after the Japanese Attach on Perl Harbor.<br />The DVD has a nice THX encoding, only with a few hickups. But in all, the digitation of the movie and sound makes the movie look almost new, even though it has 30+ years behind it - this was made when M.A.S.H. the movie was being filed. The 30 minutes documentary is impressive too - allthough not much new stuff is rewielded.<br />If I miss anything it's behind the scenes of the movie - but alas, I don't think movies about making movies were fashionable back then.<br />For Movie and history &quot;buffs&quot; I would definately get this one.
B00BUCXVPI|4|enjoyed it.
B00JH3S0AI|1|I wasted my wonderful time trying to figure out this movie. Its so bad...why...its just lazy...so lazy....silent driving...asking for directions...and trapping people in her weird dream pool thing. Its so horrible. I saw the bad reviews....i saw them.....but i watched anyway.....and now im ruined forever.
B00S58LCB0|5|It was fabulous as always.......a very timeless movie.
B003MXGNX0|5|Always been a fan of XMen! This is an amazing movie! Perfect quality... No lags nor loading. A must watch if your new to the movies
B0016YBFZ8|5|I chose to choose a five star rating because unlike others the Mafia Familia is true to form.  we really have one anothers back, when we're up against the wall so to speak.  I salute all The Mafia Familia Dons!!  May I kiss your hand??We are familia and we show it  This is one of many reasons that I rated five stars....
B00003CXBK|5|Hands down, the best animated film of all time, period. If you require more to purchase this film, I will endulge you. Miyazake, director of flics such as totoro, has branched away from &quot;kiddy-flics&quot;. While nearly all humans above 8 should view this picture, there are moments of gore. However, this is not traditional sex/monster anime, this is an epic anime superior to Star Wars, and of the same genre.<br />All hand animated, simply brilliant story telling, and incredible production value. I have only seen the Japanese version, and do not intend to watch any version with english. I do NOT speak Japanese...BUT the power of this tale requires NO verbal language. I PRAY this DVD has Japanese with english subtitles, as any other version will simply not do.<br />One can not express the power of such masterpieces, they must be viewed. If you enjoyed Star Wars, Akira, or Ghost in the Shell, you are betraying yourself not to buy this film. It certainly will have a cozy seat on my shelf, as it is the ONLY dvd I have purchased!
B001CC7PP8|5|It took me such a long time to write a review for this masterpiece because there's just so much to say about it and a movie this good deserves a good review. This movie is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, along with Rear Window, Vertigo, and all the others. I'd have to say this is my favorite Hitch movie, next to Rear Window.        First, I'll start with the performances, which are beyond Oscar-worthy. Janet Leigh should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress back in 1960, and Anthony Perkins wasn't even nominated for Best Actor, which I think is a huge mistake. I think Norman Bates is one of the best movie villains of all time. And all the other performances (Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam), are amazing, too. The film opens with amazing credits by none other than Saul Bass, into the opening scene, and scene after scene is filled with sharp dialouge, great characters, and a very eerie feeling out of all the dreary black and white, and finally halfway through the film, after the amazing parlor scene, there's the infamous \\"shower scene\\", with the shrieking violins, composed by Bernard Herrman, the camera cuts (77 different camera angles/took a week to film, and the scene is only about a minute!), and the pure terror of the scene. I really envy the people who saw it back in 1960 not knowing what was going to happen.       The film is basically two acts. The first act ends an hour into the movie, after the ten minute clean up scene, with no dialouge, right after the shower scene. The remaining 49 minutes build up more suspense until the crazy ending, which literally sent a chill down my spine. In fact, it's my favorite scene, next to the shower scene, of course. And for anyone who hasn't seen the film, I won't tell you the rest of the ending, but it's just so creepy and disturbing. It holds you right until \\"The End\\"       I haven't really said anything about this film that hasn't been said, but I just need to say this is the best suspensefilm of all time. The music, the acting, the black-and-white, the disturbing story (based on the Robert Bloch book), the infamous Bates Motel, and of course the shower scene. This is one of my favorite films of all time, from the best director of all time.        The Universal Legacy Series edition of this film is absolutely wonderful. It comes in a hard plastic case that snaps open like a book. The Disc 1 comes with the film, and some special features, including a vintage newsreel of the release of Psycho, the shower scene with and without music, lobby cards, production photos and notes, the original 6 1/2 minute trailer, with Alfred Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel, and some re-release trailers. The Disc 2 comes with The Making of Psycho, an amazing 1 1/2 hour documentary that tells all about how Psycho was made, a half-hour documentary about different directors talking about Hitchcock's influence (how it influenced thier own movies, along with showing clips of Hitchcock's own movies, which I really liked). It has different directors talking like William Friedkin, Eli Roth, Martin Scorsece, etc. I love watching that special feature over and over. The third feature is a fifteen minute excerpt of the legendary 12-hour Hitchcock/Truffaut interview. They both talk about Psycho, while it shows clips from the movie. The fourth and final feature is an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled \\"Lamb to the Slaughter\\", which is one of my favorite episodes. I love that show!       Altogether, \\"Psycho\\" is one of the greatest films of all time, and this is the greatest release of this movie (other than Blu-Ray). If you haven't seen or bought this movie, do it NOW!
B000GFLE86|5|Loved her music and love the convenience of shopping on line.  Thanks.
B008Y6WMEY|5|A guy could have a pretty good time in Vegas with all that stuff
B003XURDAY|5|I've been a fan of this show ever since it first came out. Good flick.
B0058UXHHK|5|I had a hard time putting it down. Rose is like no other character. Innocent and trusting. Very refreshing but she grows up quickly. You cheer for her growth into adulthood.
B00I75EROU|5|Don't judge a book by it's cover, right? I know that's the old saying, but when i'm browsing for books, the cover art, the title, the synopsis, and then the reviews all go into my decision of whether to read it or not. King is a guaranteed read for me so this book could have a picture of a duck on the front and i would have still bought it. I'm so glad i did, however, because the story is just fantastic. It's not a book that blows you away with crazy events and jam packed chapters loaded with chaos, but instead it lures you in with great characters who are dealing with very real and very human issues. Is there a killer? yes, but this story is a lot like the Green Mile and Bag of Bones in the way that you feel like your witnessing the beauty of the human experience. It's a great novel and just like the two above mentioned stories, i will return to it's pages and reread it again and again in the years to come.
B003UYUR0G|4|this movie was very good the story behind it was great to see where the prine was from and and to see how the sands of time came into play. I was scared to get this movie at first due to it's a disney movie. I seen it was from the makers of the pirates of the carabian it defenetly belogs in the same catagory the only thing I wonder is how will disney top the movie there should be 2 sequels as it was based on the game althoe there is no sceens of game play in this movie I cant wait to see if disney will make a sequal if folowed by the game it will have to be the half prince, defenetly a must see if you like the pirates of the carabian you'll love this.
B005LAIIRQ|3|This movie was definitely worth the time on the couch. The back and forth from the past to present was a bit annoying at first but made the whole movie pull together in the end. Not what I was expecting which turned out to be a &#34;Good Thing&#34;.
B008JFUR10|4|Well, this was a real surprise for me. From the first preview I had written this off a a waste of time. Yet, it was a Del Toro movie.... Hmmmm..... Then I heard a review on NPR and it was all positive. This got me thinking this may be worth a look.<br /><br />It was definitely worth it! You must, of course, get over the big mechanical thing, and the bizarre monster- yes - you have to call them monsters. If you can, the movie is a lot of fun, and, they even manage to give you a few characters who you can cheer for. It is what a summer movie should be. Lots of action blended with enough character insight to to have you get a little interested in the actual story. There are some great cinematic scenes that I found exceptional, and the thematic music that they put together, also worked very well. I'd actually call this one a keeper!
B002SJIO54|5|If you like sci-fi action with a bit of social commentary thrown in, this is a must see! When a human gets infected with a virus that turns him into an alien, who does he turn to for help? The gripping storyline leads up to one of the most satisfying fight scenes of 2009!
B009LREA1S|2|Sound quality not great with the Amazon fire TV. Could not hear the movie at the highest sound level. It was very faint.
B004EPZ0AM|1|This movie is awful.  Dont buy it, Dont watch it, better stuff on netflix for much cheaper.  I'd rather watch paint dry then see this again.
B007WEQ3K8|5|It's was very interesting and I like the mini games. It doesn't take a lot of time and energy. I use it for my kids and free time.
B00097A5HW|5|This is one of the best Shakira albums ever. This is a voyage to new sounds and styles. I think this record is better than her last in spanish \\"Donde estan los ladrones\\". The collaboration with Cerati makes an impressive distinction on tracks like \\"Un da especial\\" and \\"No\\" where Shakira's voice sounds tremendously fine. This album has also powerful ballads like \\"tus pupilas\\" and all the lyrics are thoughtful. <br />Buy this album, you wont't regret it!
B00KK0PICK|4|Somewhat repetitive, but THIS BOOK WILL HELP you streamline your life and increase your happiness index.  I am going to gift to friends and family members.  I think the current version is most geared towards women (ie. a lot of time spent on clothing),  she would hit a homerun, tailoring a version for 'guys'.  We have our own vices, ie Tools, hardware, paperwork, 'toys'
B00B22ASUM|5|Heartwarming and engaging story, a break from the crime novels I tend to read. I enjoyed reading this book from page one until the end. Still rooting for James and Bob, absolutely intend to get the sequel.
B000FC1MM8|5|Harry investigates the murder of a prostitute who happens to be his mother.  This is a classic cold case file.  A good story told by a superb story teller.
B00006YXEK|5|At the time this review was written, the world has been without George Harrison for about a year. With the loss of John Lennon, the heart of the Beatles was departed. Now it is safe to say that the soul of the Fab Four is nothing more than a memory.<br />Brainwashed features a George Harrison freer and more relaxed since the early Beatle days. Prometheus unbound could not have been more emancipated from the shackles of  pressure and concern as to how an artistic work would be received.  This album just might be George's best work ever, and is definitely a wonderful goodbye to those who loved the man and enjoyed his music. I admit a tear or two passed between the tracks.<br />Both Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison deserve kudos for a job well done in production. What had begun with The Traveling Wilburys and Cloud Nine continues and is more than mere ear candy.<br />Jeff Lynne, who was the driving force behind the original Electric Light Orchestra, can be heavy handed with his direction, but I feel he handled George's songs with care. Listening to Dhani Harrison-and seeing him physically on the enclosed DVD-is haunting. Dhani's resemblance to his father is uncanny...especially when thinking of the George of the early Fab Four days.<br />All the songs are worthy, but two deserve special mention. \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" is a wonderful song that George Harrison did with Jools Holland. Listening to George play a song he thoroughly enjoyed-but did not compose-is a definite treat. Nothing more screams the true George Harrison than does this excellent performance. \\"Run So Far\\" was a song George contributed to Eric Clapton's monster album Journeyman in 1989.<br />Brainwashed does a good job of embodying all that made George Harrison such a delightful, special singer, composer and individual. About the time Jim Croce died, an old clich&eacute; made the rounds-Heaven must have a hell of a band. Now, I truly think it does.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Good game. Pretty challenging at times. But thats what i love about it.
B00CDSVZHY|3|This film has a good storyline but it seems to drag on and fails to get to the point. I liked how there was some comedy  within the movie.
B00DF0ZP8Y|5|Ordered as a Christmas gift for my Great Granddaughters and they loved them!
B0026IUXO2|5|The film may take many historical liberties, but it delivers a solid emotional portrayal of the times. The costumes and actors were magnificent. This movie may just turn me into a medieval film fan! Cate Blanchett gave an incredible performance - it's been many years since I've been so enthralled. This is one of the few films I will likely watch multiple times. I think I fell a wee bit in love with Francis Walsingham, the character played by Geoffrey Rush.
B00J004EP8|5|Aaron Paul has a great performance in this movie. The storyline is good and I like the emotion he displays throughout the movie.
B00NEQRNVG|3|Eva needs to take a chill pill!
B002CLBJPK|5|Love it. Has a few more scenes than the VHS.
B000051VWW|4|I loved this cd.It's really good.It reminds me of some of her other songs on &quot;The Best of Sade&quot;,that I had.&quot;Somebody Already Broke my Heart&quot;,&quot;King of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; is my favorites.Sade has a smooth,soothing,relaxing,somewhat peaceful voice and sound to her.She's very talent.And I like the fact that she keeps herself out of the media.She keeps herself very secluded,which is a good thing.But this album is good,and it shows her maturity too.
B002KQ6BT6|5|Very good book. I enjoyed it immensely. It kept me riveted all of the way through the book. I love the factual information that I learn from his books too. Very interesting! Opens your eyes to new ways of thinking about things, especially the Bible and religion.
B000E8NRR6|3|The jury is still out with this one for me.  The recording sounds like any other Steely Dan/Fagen CD - great.  But I think the songs are a little tooooo long.  Maybe that is where I find the negativity for me.  I put a few songs on my IPOD, but will wait until I add the rest.  Gave it 3 stars because I liked his previous solo work & I have the Steely Dan box set.
B00IINPXLW|3|i liked it but it just wasant as good as cut the rope 1 so i geus what im saying is i really dont like the second one.
B0091REZMW|3|its not a bad game lots of pop ups though. still pretty fun. some of the instructions are not very clear either.
B004V5QWU2|1|Plays air conditioner with any and all tracks. How do I stop it?
B008G59IBI|5|kinda sad that rock is really out of the mainstream but nothing can stop me from listening to this album this album is the best from the three got good melody and good lyrics,,nice job Green Day,
B0041KW076|5|The hi fidelity of his sound, the package, the build quality, are some things that you have to take in account if you like to buy this record. If you are a fan, buy all of them, This record reached 10/10 points.
B00AMBLXP8|5|When this movie came out in theaters I thought &#34;Seriously and adult movie about a teddy bear&#34;? However when it was available to rent people kept saying how funny it was so I rented it. It was hilarious! Much funnier then I ever thought it would be. I recommend if you want a good laugh. The ending was a bit odd, but hey it is a talking teddy bear movie!
B007TKT2SK|5|This app makes calculating fractions quick and easy. It is a great tool to use for helping daughter with homework and for calculating recipes on the fly! thanks developers
B0009S3HI0|5|I've been waiting so long for this release. Finally we have all the videos in a crystal clear format that are official and not downloaded or burned. The videos are nice and have an epic, dark, moody and emotional atmoshere. I do wish that they had more behind the scenes kind of stuff and some live performances, but it's all good. <br /> The cd is great and has some real gems. The only song that kind of gets on my nerves is the Teenager song that has the singer from Idiot Pilot singing with Chino.Don't get me wrong, the guitar is nice and Chino is awesome but that guy from Idiot Pilot totally murders the song. It wouldn't be as bad if he hit the same notes as Chino did in the original version, but instead of singing the original way he sings higher and it just sounds strange. He's not a terrible singer, it's just that the notes are wrong and that's why it makes me cringe to listen to the Idiot Pilot singer on the track. <br /> Don't let that discourage you from purchasing though , because the cd really does contain some awesome songs. My favorites would have to be Simple Man, Change, Be Quite and Drive, If Only Tonight We could Sleep, Savory, and Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want. <br />  The cover of the Cure's \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" is great and better than the original. It is a live version and still sounds great, but I really hope they record it in a studio and release it.I think it's that good of a version to do so.  <br />   I really respect the passion and emotion that is put into the Deftones music. Give this CD/DVD a chance, You will find that you have made the right choice.
B002VECM6S|5|This was one of the best sports movies I have ever seen.....I highly recommend it to all sports enthusiasts and others
B00LSUNGJS|5|omg! This is amazing!! They are right on the mark with V!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Love all season of Downton Abbey.....watch them over and over......Cannot wait until the Season 4 premieres!!!  The costumes are fantastic!!!
B00BUADSMQ|1|Bruce Willis should be ashamed of himself. Very poor story with a predictable ending. It gives a bad name to the franchise.
B004JN1CW4|3|The book was a 3/5 in my standards due to tag story line not being as good as the previous two books. It seemed like the author dragged the story line out more than needed and mostly ruined the book towards the end. It was not a bad buy. All in all I would read this trilogy again.
B00G4NUQYM|4|This is a great way to sharpen your vocabulary intuition!  The game challenges you to re-think your word choices and stretches your brain along the way.  Can be frustrating at first, but becomes easier the more you play!  Try it today!
B0002BO0AS|5|Let me start off by saying that this isn't emo at all.  This is metalcore with a thrashy edge.  And yes, my favorite genres of metal are melodic death and power metal (weird combo) and I listen to pretty much every type of metal such as black, thrash, and progressive but that does not change the fact that metalcore is bad.  This is the new wave of American metal and it is good.  Atreyu is not the new wave, but Unearth is clearly in a good direction. <br /> <br />Now, as with the European band similarities, I do hear many influences in the melodic death genre from the old melodic death masters such as Soilwork, In Flames, Arch Enemy, At the Gates and as well as some newer bands like Within Y and Omnium Gatherum.  However, the album is in no way emotional but merely catchy and will cause you to headbang!   <br /> <br />Let's admit, the new wave of American metal nametag is pretty dumb and is clearly for people who don't listen to European bands but listens to the 80's bands such as Metallica and Slayer (which are in no way bad).  These bands, namely KsE, Shadows Fall, Diecast, God Forbid, All that Remains, Haste the Day, and many more are metalcore but are really good bands.  Still, I think European metal kicks metalcore's ass, but its still pretty great. <br /> <br />BTW: there are some good american bands such as The Red Death, Arsis, and Capharnaum.  If you haven't heard of many of these bands, I suggest you check out metal from Sweden.
B0040I09RM|5|Can't wait to watch season 2
B00C8S9VKM|5|Loved it. Very informative.
B003AO1SVS|5|Wonderful CD.  Brilliant artists.  This recording is great all the way through.  I find it hard to find CDs like that.  I am new to the Black Keys, but I assure you that I will be buying a lot more of their stuff.
B00FAX6XQC|3|The instructions are not very clear.
B002MQYOFW|4|Very surprised! I had heard all the raving reviews about this book, but ever a skeptic, I \\"borrowed\\" this from Amazon prime and I am glad I did! In  the beginning there is some confusion in where and when this takes place that is never really clarified, but soon it does not matter and the author quickly has you wrapped into the characters and story. I read this from cover to cover in less than 24 hours, and I am looking forward to the second book!
B003O86FMW|5|I really enjoyed it, I didn't want to put it down! I'm a little sad I'm almost done reading the books but, now…on to the 3rd book!
B00IRISI42|4|Good story. I enjoy Puller. Similar to Jack reacher. Getting to be same story over again
B0024Y9EYS|5|I liked the story line and characters. I just wish it would have lasted more than 2 seasons. I would have liked to see them fight some T1000's to see how they would have killed them.
1401225756|5|I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman's style of writing and actually got this book after many years of waiting. It is in a comic book format but that doesn't bother me. There are several more in the 'Sandman' series so I'm gonna be busy for a while.
B0043RSK3K|5|me parece muy serio y valiente el trabajo por los autores de esta obra.<br />todo indica que cualquier tipo de poder político o económico, envenena y ciega al ser humano<br />y parece inevitable el enorme daño que provocan las diversas ambiciones que revela esta obra.
B00ACP3OOM|4|This is easy to use, completely waterproof; at least for lap swimming. I tried it on outside the water at the house to adjust everything and when I turned it on I was disappointed by the sound, kind of muffled. So, I went to the pool, WOW! what a difference water makes. The sound it ear-splitting if you're not careful. Completely adequate for lap swimming, relatively comfortable, easy to adjust and load music from the computer. If there is one thing I wish it had a little more of is bass. I really like to hear the harmony on some of the music I listen to and the bass line is my favorite part. Unfortunately it's a little lite. Overall this is way better than no music.
B005SEYOXW|5|Awesome series! Perfect blend of the old west and sci-fi.
B000K1P66W|5|I have been going through some emotional battles that have built up over the years following a divorce and an ongoing custody battle.  I broke down and went and seen a psychologist and she suggested that I read this book.  Now mind you I've tried little things here and there and the anger just kept building up so I figured what they heck, I'll buy it and see what it's all about.    All I can say about this book is wow, simply amazing.  After reading it I've become 'obsessed' about reading more of Don Miguel Ruiz's books!  I've gone on to purchase the Master of Knowledge and the Master of Love.  I want to read the Fifth Agreement but it's only found in hardback at the moment.      This book will move you.  It will make you open up to your thoughts.  Everyone raved about The Secret but really should be raving about this book!!  I am forever changed and have realized that I need to have more self respect and more confidence and once I have those the rest will fall into place.    I suggest anyone going through a trying time to read this book, no matter what the situation it will put things into perspective for you and will give you a brand new joyous outcome on life
B00C1S945G|5|love it!
B000FC130E|4|Mr Gaiman created a world of shabby beauty and grandeur. Playing on our fears of simply not making a bit of difference and falling through the cracks of life the story makes us understand that what truly matters and what we believe matter are vastly different things.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|I thought big little lies was good, this was even better, twists and turns in every chapter!  A must read!
B008JEJN8O|5|I wanted to purchase this pair of shoes for my husband during the Crocs sale but the site went out of stock. I came to Amazon and found out that here is actually cheaper than the Crocs' site! I purchased this pair and they fit perfectly. My husband's feet are wider than normal. He hasn't worn them yet but he loves them being so fit. He had another classic crocs for a couple years but the bottom of the shoes has lost their traction.
B006Q2LTRO|5|I thought I was fairly intelligent, but after reading this book I felt pretty ignorant, especially on the subject of love.  I am still trying to incorporate what I have learned, and plan to read this book over and over.

0316067598|1|The United States is blessed to have sons of republic that value our country as much as Marcus Luttrell does.  The warriors that defend democracy are needed, revered and are true heros.  This book howedver does not honor any of those values and is poorly written.  Mr. Luttrell sprinkles his tough guy image and over the top machismo throughout the book I was wonder just who the hell he was trying to convince how tough he is/was.  Mr. Luttrell isn't too up on the Constitution and just how the government of his country is structured and the references to the liberal media, liberal politicians made me wonder is some fourth level hack from Karl Rove's office wrote the drivel.  The men and women that serve in our Armed Forces are to be celebrated.  They go on looking for WMD's even though there were never any and many of the people of the United States were aware of the lies years ago.  This book is poorly written, heavily slanted and full of uninteresting drivel.  Save you money and go buy Richard Marchinko's books about the SEAL Teams.
B000002UAI|5|Words Of Love, I'll Follow The Sun, and Every Little Thing....  beautiful songs I can listen to over and over and over and do do do.  There are other songs I love on this album too, but I'd have bought it for just the three I mentioned!
B000VYX8PE|5|I enjoyed this book very much. I read them growing up and wanted to read then again. I would recommend them to people.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Enjoy trying to win each level. Sometimes it may take lots of tries but when you finally get it you feel great. It is fun sharing it with friends on Facebook
0307588378|5|I loved this book; couldn't put it down.
B000002VSN|2|I guess I have a minority opinion but I cannot find as much excitement over Whitney's voice at all. OK, it is very strong and clear, it can sing very high and very low. But does that make a good voice, does that make expression? To me, Whitney's voice does not sound sensitive nor does it sound pleasant. To me, it's rather a voice with a huge lack of expressional character. It expresses nothing to me but a woman who wants to break all chords and alter the music business into an olympic competition for breaking chords. Also the Georgia Mass Choir is somewhat disappointing, I've heard some good RnB and Gospel but this album is one scream to me. There is no spiritual softness here rather an unbalanced attempt to pump religion into a commercial record. Religion as an individual process is not promoted in here. Also the non-gospel Whitney songs on this album are kinda weak and sound fairly hypocritical to me. If u want a good gospel album pick Mahalia Jackson.
B0094LYJZI|5|This movie was perfect for those who see themselves as a &#34;trophy&#34;.  When the insides becomes the outside, and the true person is revealed, you may not like it.  This caused the &#34;trophy&#34; to reevaluate their true character. Keep your dates, and never underestimate the power of the &#34;other&#34; person. You may not like what you see in yourself.
B00C7KYXHW|5|Hannibal is riveting. Each episode left me wondering if it was even safe to leave my house. Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal is the perfect combination of charming and frightening with just the right amount of sex appeal. Possibly the most exciting thing about this series, though, is the beautiful execution of each storyline. The crimes are certainly heinous, but I could never find the strength to look away because every detail is just fascinating. It seems that nothing is off-limits and each moment is thrilling.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I recommend this game to any people who have a kindle  fire and can't get flappy Bird. It's fun and addicting also you can challenge your friends on your score. I also recommend this game to people who like flappy Bird and just want a different version or something.
B008602KQI|3|Good story line at the beginning. However, it lacked the action scenes I expected. The sci-fi bees and dogs, not to mention the fireballs, took too much away from the movies gladiator styled theme. The movie was not as exciting as a result.
B003O6R2DK|4|The sound quality is remarkably superb, I'm glad to have found it on amazon best part no shipping cost.  Thank you
B008220BLG|3|First we had the spin-doctors telling us \\"Vampires are nice guys, some of them, and they're sparkly!\\"<br /><br />Now, it's zombie rehab. You know, \\"But Daa-aad, he's a really NICE zombie and I like him! And anyway, he's getting better. And he hardly ever eats brains any more, only on special occasions.\\"<br /><br />And, not only does over-eager teenage hormonalism turn the living dead into not-so-dead, it affects all the bystander zombies, too. I mean, all the ones who don't have a cute non-zombie girlfriend of their own - they get better just watching. (As a wise man once said, 'Voyeurism is participation.' I guess that when the teenage girlfriend is cute enough, that's all it takes.)<br /><br />So, we have the star-crossed teenaged lovers with parents who just don't understand. We have them mysteriously un-crossing their stars through The Power of Love (chaste version). And it just happens that their names are Julia and something that starts with R, but no one can remember what. (Get it? Julia and R? Get it?)<br /><br />Well, it could have been worse. They might not have gotten John Malkovich. But, based on recent trailers in theaters, it looks like it's going to get worse.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B000002KET|3|Let me start by saying that this album's title track (a righteous guitar grind accompanied by a pounding rhythym section and Ozzy's insane wail) ranks among Sabbath's best songs.  Even Tony Iommi has admitted that he belives that tune to be Sabbath's finest.  Although I wouldn't quite go that far, it certainly is good. <BR>The rest of the album, unfortunately, pales in comparison.  Sabbra Cadabra, Killing Yourself To Live, and A National Acrobat are decent, but nothing special.  Fluff seems like a directionless imitation of Vol. 4's Laguna Sunrise, and Spiral Architect is too light and airy to make a lasting impression.<BR>This is not to say that Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a bad album; the band's playing is still tight and Ozzy's vocals remain powerful and inspired.  It's just not up to par with any of Sabbath's previous releases or the following album, Sabotage.
B00J2PRBNS|5|Keeps your interest throughout , good movie, You know how some movies you can figure out what or where its going early on. This movie takes twists and turns that keeps you guessing. Worth seeing, rent it !!
B008Z9YGEE|5|Rented this several times for my grandchildren.
B007THA4FI|4|The story does start off slow and I had the urge to quit reading it; however, owing to my faith in Jo's writing, I decided to continue on. First of all, reviewers who didn't like this story either did not finish it or were just expecting another extraordinary Harry Potter story to come out. On the contrary, The Casual Vacancy is anything but extraordinary --- the novel focuses on one small little town and on the ordinary lives of its residents. I do admit that the premise of the story would have have grip me to read the book if it weren't written by Jo. It is not a gripping story that would keep you awake at night, wanting to know what's next, wanting to read more. I read this book over the course of six months (I usually read and finish books within a day or two) during my downtime at work, wanting to finish it and knowing what eventually happens. When it all ended, I did feel like I would miss reading about the characters because the characters, especially the teenagers of the story, was the most interesting part of the story.
B002RSDW80|4|Wow!  This was a fast shipment and I can't wait to sit down and watch it. Thanks for good service!
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is so cute and funny, it's like subway surfers but more fun. I like the minion alfits. I watched the movies and was excited to find out there was a minion game! It's fun using all the power ups and the minion launcher. And this game is free so go ahead, have fun!
B00VFTD43A|5|Not only does this show the genius of Alan Turing and the injustices of the time, it does so in a way that you can empathize with the characters.<br /><br />Make sure you have time to sit and watch this movie uninterrupted, it deserves it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Fabulous!
030758836X|3|I really wanted to put this book in my best-book-ever category. But it turned out to be as anti-climactic as it was riveting. This a tale of: who-done-it meets what happened meets what's-the-truth? That makes for an addictive read and I was up late at night eager to find out how the story would unfold. The story shifts between Nick's perspective during the investigation of his wife's disappearance and entries from Amy's diaries, which chronicle the couple's first meeting in NYC and the decline of their relationship over the next 5 years. It's their contrasting views of their marriage that raises all kinds of questions, one of which is Nick's involvement in Amy's disappearance.<br /><br />There are no true heroes in this story. Not in the traditional sense. One could argue that the term villain is relative in Gone Girl. This isn't a story about a nice, married couple. Ms Flynn's main characters are so well crafted, dark and complex that I understood how Nick and Amy became the people they are, even if I didn't like the things they did. The unraveling of the marriage felt real because it came in bits and pieces over the years until Nick and Amy finally arrived at a broken relationship.<br /><br />The whole thing fell down for me about 2/3 in. The big twist reminded me of the finale of a best-selling Scott Turow novel. If you've read his books you might know the novel in question and see the similarities. I was still intrigued to find out how Gone Girl would end. But the resolution hinged on a backup plan conveniently working out. Some folks can overlook it, but I can't. The premise of the story was based on a meticulously calculated scheme and to have it fall apart then \\"work\\" based on a convenient timeline flies in the face of the story's groundwork. I just couldn't buy into what the last 100 pages were selling though I wanted to because the initial story approach and the writing was very good. For me, the ending felt anti-climactic. I wasn't looking for a perfect, bow-tie ending but this felt like a hallow victory and it didn't match the story that I started with.<br /><br />That said, Gone Girl is an entertaining read and as long you don't get caught up in hyped-up expectations, then go for it.
B00B2V66VS|5|I love this app! try it your self you will love it! after I'll play more plus it is free,
B0099RFVXQ|5|very good  it keep you in your seat
B003TOPQI0|4|I enjoyed this movie. It was a clever crime/boxing movie. Brad Pitt was hard to understand in some parts of the movie though (although that was part of his character). I really enjoyed it. I have seen it a few times now
B004V9MU86|5|I had pre-conceived ideas what this book would be like but wasn't prepared for the emotional journey that followed.  The story is told in a unique and moving way that holds your interest and takes you back in time to a world reeling with war and injustice.  We see it from a young girl's eyes and watch as the story unfolds.<br />I would recommend this book as an inspiration to everyone and particularly to those that have been fortunate to live a sheltered life.
B003YL4LYI|4|Outstanding, can't wait for the next volume.
B00KW274SM|5|Non-Stop is a good movie.  Very entertaining with twists and turns that keep you guessing from start to finish.  Of course, the critics will pick the film apart with a variety of TSA standard operating procedures being violated - implying a total lack of real security at our airports such as getting a bomb through security.  Remember it's just a movie folks.
B007THA4FI|5|And here we thought we'd never get to this point. The review of The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />I've posted a few things en route on this book, because reading it was like a journey and on a journey, you make pit stops from time to time. Really, all books are a journey, but this one in particular expanded my horizons. Much like that cross-country drive you take to save money by not flying; there's that mid-drive lull when you wonder 'why on earth did we drive?' until that moment of spectacular view and you tell yourself, 'that's why...'<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy has a spectacular view.<br /><br />As most people know, The Casual Vacancy is written by super-selling Harry Potter author, JK Rowling. She's the author with the million-dollar idea of a bespectacled magical boy. Literally, a multi-million dollar idea.<br /><br />With such a platform already built, branching out into a new genre, adult fiction, was a leap someone with her status was able to take without fear of failure. I'd like to believe as an author, she does worry if her work will be accepted or rejected by the masses, but that worry does not include her financial status.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a triumph for Rowling. Keep writing. Please.<br /><br />The Novel:<br />The premise of the novel centers around the death of Barry Fairbrother, who dies unexpectedly in his early forties. Being all of this takes place in the very small town of Pagford, the little idyllic English abode is in shock (apparently, small towns are the same everywhere). Barry was every man's man, and every woman's secret crush. He had a way of ingratiating himself upon people be it with fine talk, a cajoling laugh, or a kindred spirit. He was noted as the living embodiment of a self-made man that harbored no arrogance about it. And his death reveals all the vengeance that has been swept under the rug for years in Pagford because his death leaves an open seat on the council, and political battles reveal the deep demons festering in the hearts of every citizen existing among the cobbled streets and ancient abbey. This empty seat soon becomes the catapult of a full-blown town war. Awaiting with baited breath who will fill this seat takes the reader into the minds of Pagford's citizens from the rich to the poor, the educated and uneducated, and the self-proclaimed high to the very, very low. The book is thought-provoking with regular twists and turns. A solid read.<br /><br />The Review:<br />For me, the book started strong. I felt an immediate connection to the characters and even though Barry Fairbrother's death occurs early in the novel, I felt sadness for his departure. This is a testament to the brilliant writing style of Rowling. Too often, authors kill a character early on without establishing a real connection with the reader, and consequently it leaves the reader feeling like they lost only a stranger. Fairbrother's death establishes a thread that winds throughout the novel.<br /><br />The town of Pagford is well depicted. I can still see it in my mind's eye. It's quaint and charming, but at the same time, cold and gray. Rowling does an excellent job developing the backdrop for the story to include how this backdrop intertwines with the plot.<br /><br />Her characters are so visceral. She explores the lives of not only the adults in the town, but also the teens and the very real affect they take on the lives of their parents, their teachers, the headmaster, and the counselors. She exposes the viscous cycle of the educated and the uneducated, and blows the roof off the hypocritical alliance the rich people of Pagford have for the poor they \\"are trying to help.\\"  Her portrayal of the high school students I found to be expertly written as it captured the way I often view the students I teach everyday; and sadly this was not a good thing. I think, as a teacher, it gave me some comfort to know that across the ocean, teenagers are the same. I was beginning to think we only had true pricks in America.<br /><br />It is certainly true this book is not for children. There is the foulest of language and horrible, depraved depictions of sex. The context of the book really requires you to examine marriage, friendships, and acquaintances in a new way. It causes one to think about trust and how very fragile this is, and it plays to the fantasy life both men and women desire to have amidst the reality they are living in. This book is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a literary read. It is not fast paced nor action packed, but it is deep. I found there was a lull mid-way for me, but as I pressed on I understood the intentionality of this choice by the author. Real life is not always in fast-forward, and this book is a snapshot of real people, of real life.<br /><br />In the end, I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars, a rating I rarely establish upon any book. I know I will continue to think about the lessons and depth of emotion created by Rowling in this novel for years to come. That, my friends, is the mark of a good book.ks in America.<br /><br />It is certainly true this book is not for children. There is the foulest of language and horrible, depraved depictions of sex.

0767830555|5|I'm not really much of a movie &quot;critic&quot;; In fact I dislike most critics as they think everyone else should have the same tastes in movies and plays.  In my personal opinion, Taxi Driver MUST be one of the best, if not the best, movies of all time.  If you are looking for an Action Jackson, kill'em all, special effects, light-speed space travel thriller then... You will be disappointed.  However, if you enjoy thought-provoking stories, solid, convincing acting, and a movie that seriously makes you THINK and entertain you at the same time, Taxi Driver is the spot!  Then again, thats just my personal opinion :)
0307265730|3|I don't want to criticize Jhumpa for always choosing the same milieu and the same class of Ivy League privileged Bengali families in the US. It's all well known and she doesn't try to deny it. But what seems most disappointing about her writing is that we have the impression she is constantly recycling the same characters, who although sometimes flawed, always seem somewhat too well planned out and not real enough.  They want to live beyond the constraints of their cultural up-bringing, but they never really expand their experience beyond occasionally marrying an American. The short story that stood out the most for me was \\"Nobody's business\\" where the author finally strays from the usual plot; that of a mixed marriage, but the plot still seems to dance around marriage and education.<br />Ms Lahiri's writing is mostly quite pleasant, skilled and at times a brilliantly put together prose, yet it lacks luster or humor. The characters, like the story lines are always on the verge of exploding, on the verge of something meaningful happing to them, yet they always stop short and the endings inevitably seem underwhelming.<br />The emotions that she tries so hard to elicit in the reader feel contrived.  Having read numerous comparisons to Alice Munro, I was expecting much more, but if you are looking for an enjoyable read on the plane, I'd whole heartedly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5|great  game. tons of options and or tweeks to make this a fun filled long lasting non boring challenging game.
B000G8NXYG|5|Words fail to praise the action-packed period film that Akira Kurosawa created in 1954 Japan. Two years after the allies released the Japanese from occupation, Kurosawa directed the best film ever, in my opinion, for those that desire evil to be overthrown and justice to prevail. The plight of the peasants is graphically detailed in breath-taking scenes of beauty and poise. Coming to their aid is the most virtuous samurai in film history, ready at a moment to battle the bandits that would rob, rape, and murder the helpless peasantry. The camera angles and positioning are excellent beyond belief, the costumes are real, and the mud is thick for the final battle scene. Any movie fan that doesn't have the recent Criterion Collection Seven Samurai is missing out on a classic. Honor, loyalty, skill, and faith  come alive on the screen in 17th century Japan.

B00T3DNKIE|4|I liked it a  lot and did not think I would after the not so good reviews it was given.  Characters were well developed by the author. The end was surprising but well done.

B00005U11Z|5|This DVD is a great way to introduce someone to Journey, whether the person is a new fan or is trying to make the transition from Steve Perry's departure after Trial By Fire.<br />The DVD was taped for a Direct-TV special and it features the current Journey line-up of lead singer Steve Augeri, guitarist Neal Schon, keyboardist Jonathan Cain, bassist Ross Valory and drummer Deen Castronovo.<br />The DVD is a full concert featuring Journey's greatest hits, including songs such as &quot;Open Arms,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop Believin',&quot; and &quot;Any Way You Want It.&quot; It also includes new songs &quot;Higher Place&quot; and &quot;All the Way.&quot;<br />Seeing Journey live is such a different experience than listening to a CD. I've seen the current lineup four times in concert, and this DVD captures the emotion and raw energy of the concerts! You may just find yourself blasting the music, dancing, and singing along!<br />Steve Perry fans: Some of you may be wary of Steve Augeri, but this DVD shows that he can do justice to Journey's hits while maintaining his own vocal style. Contrary to what some people say, he really isn't a dead ringer for Perry. This may turn you to a new era of Journey!<br />Overall, the sound quality is awesome and the video is great. This is a great substitute if you can't make it to a Journey concert!

0425263908|3|The author borrowed HEAVILY from 50Shades! I was seriously appalled! Some have said the same about 50 Shades and Twilight.  But there is a difference between being inspired by a story line and going in a completely opposite direction with it, and being inspired and write the same EXACT book!  Whoever said these were the authors words, is a lie! How E.L isn't getting a piece of this pie, is beyond me.<br /><br />It's hard for me to judge this story line on it's own merits because it is too similar to 50 Shades.  When I finished reading this book, I reread 50 shades.  I willl say this... Gideon has NOTHING on Christian.  lol.  I can see the story in my mind from 50 Shades.  I can't see this yet with Gideon.  Maybe the second book will help?? I don't know.<br /><br />When I ready 50 Shades of Grey, I immediately downloaded Darker to my Kindle.  I finished reading this book last week and I've been debating on whether buying the 2nd book is worth it.  We shall see!
1400049628|4|Was a good purchase. Book was shipped early. Only thing was that the box looked like it had been scraped or cut by a knife and the cut transferred onto the book. But it was so small, I didn't care.

I have not yet viewed the movie, as I am waiting for my company to arrive the end of this month.I am certain it will be fine. I love this movie.  A group of friends said the new version is terrible, so I am having them in to watch this next month, so they can enjoy this lovely old movie, too.<br />I was named after Norma Shearer, in 1930.<br />Thank you for your usual fine prompt service.<br />Norma Coffin

B009UX2YAC|5|I, personally, enjoyed this game very much. When I had cotton this app, (for free!) I had been sick.  Searching around the wide variety of apps, I came across Subway Suffers as one of the top hits in the store. Remembering that many of my friends had enjoyed this game, I downloaded it. I happily played the game for the days that I was sick. This not only kept me entertained, but as I got better, I played it at a healthy rate, also. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it for everyone at any age!

B007XIO9TU|5|It is great to see a legend still doing his thing. With a talented group of musicians as a backup, Johnny shows why he is still one of the greatest bluesmen of all time!
B001CVCBLM|5|For the uninitiated, Mogwai is one of the most popular (and most talented) \\"post-rock\\" bands in the world. They have been rocking and rolling for almost ten years and their albums stand as monuments to post-rock music. What is post-rock you ask? I don't know exactly...but I know I enjoy most music labeled as \\"post-rock.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Hawk is Howling\\" is another fine addition to the Mogwai catalog. Like every Mogwai release, the music captures many different emotions and sentiments.<br /><br />The track sequencing is superb. (Listen to every track from the beginning to the end.) The album features both soft, meandering guitar pieces and loud, furious guitar pieces. The soft tracks and the loud tracks work together to create a unique experience.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"I'm Jim Morrison, I'm Dead,\\" is gentle and melancholic and then it soars upward in volume and intensity.<br /><br />Track two, \\"Batcat,\\" explodes with layered, heavy guitars.<br /><br />The next track, \\"Danphe and the Brain,\\" is breathtaking (for lack of a better word). (Turn up the volume and soak it up.)<br /><br />The next several tracks, \\"Local Authority,\\" \\"The Sun Smells Too Loud,\\" and \\"King's Meadow\\" are all flawless.<br /><br />Track seven, \\"I Love You, I'm Going to Blow Up Your School,\\" is gloomy and ominous, but perhaps the most thought-provoking track on the album.<br /><br />Tracks eight and nine, \\"Scotland's Shame\\" and \\"Thank You Space Expert,\\" are gentle, but more uplifting and positive.<br /><br />And the final track, track ten, \\"The Precipice,\\" builds to a fantastic and conclusive finish.<br /><br />(Several B-Sides, not included on this version, are circulating throughout the internet; they are awesome too! But DO NOT download this album. Show some respect for the artistry and the artists.)<br /><br />If you love post-rock music or music that never receives radio airtime, consider \\"The Hawk is Howling\\" from Mogwai. It's different; it's fresh.<br /><br />Keep on rockin' and rollin'! Bring Mogwai home; order this album today.
0439023513|5|A great ending to a fascinating story.  Begin with The Hunger Games.  Read it even if you've seen the movie.  As with most books, it's better than the movie.
030758836X|5|A very good read.
0448060191|5|Alcott's novel recounting the lives of the March family is aremarkable book reflective of her own unusual upbringing (the Marchesare all modeled after her real-life family, from her artistic sister May to her scholarly father).  The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.<br />I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston.  What a wonderful way to come back to a book that shaped my life and ideas of independence.
B00MIA0KGY|5|Christmas gift for my wife.  Very affordable and she loved it!
0802798225|5|i am gonna make it short and sweet. This book is amazing! It has the perfect amount of humor and romance, it will make you laugh and cry all in one page. Alex is so sweet behind his bad-boy persona, all he really wants to do is protect the ones he loves. I would probably have hated Brittney if not for her inner vulnerability as well as how kind she is to her sister. The romance was torn between hot/cute, which was perfect. All in all this book is one you will read over and over.
B00004R95G|1|When I put it into the player, it refused to take it and the player kept spitting out the disc which I wasn expecting it to do. I wish I did make this purchase.
1452110581|5|Part of a white elephant gift exchange - book was a hit. People couldn't stop laughing as they read through the poems - great buy!
B0054SMIH6|5|For me, most movies are average or below average. However, this movie held my interest to the end. It was excellent and I highly recommend it.
B005LAIISA|4|Well done and entertaining to me and especially for my kids they love this show it is good clean show.
B00005A0BC|5|Awesome LP
B00CWY76CC|1|I couldn't figure out how this game worked. It just pops up with no directions as to how to play it.
B00EL8I8IS|4|New take on the Zombie craze, not bad but did not read the book either. If you are looking for a good time sit back and enjoy, some scenes are a little too graphic for kids under the age of 10, just my opinion.
B00H71PBQ8|5|An absolutely GREAT show.  We have loved all four seasons.  Can't wait for the next season to start.
0071624058|4|-almost everything you need to know  -fairly advanced, NOT intermediate, level  -wish it had audio CDs in addition to CD-ROM
B001XRLWPQ|5|I was soooo satisfied with this product! It arrived right on time and in wonderful condition! Thanks for such a great product!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|I don't use this as much as I thought I would but it is handy when I need it.
B009TGWYGY|4|I enjoyed the movie but was disappointed the script didn't go with history. The college never debated in the Ivy league. However, it's a good adventure on civil rights.
B00RVC3YKI|1|Boring
B004EBT5CU|5|I can't think of too many second albums this good.  It is a LEAST as good as 19, if not better.  There are some really great songs on here at the beginning and the end of the album, and the stuff in the middle isn't bad either (not a lot of filler or throw away songs here).  \\"Rolling in the deep\\" is probably the best known, but \\"Rumor has it\\" and many others are excellent as well.  Hard to believe this is the voice of a 21 year old.  Highly recommended.
B004VMUS9G|5|THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it works great!!!even. if you fall.asleep with music on it still goes off.I.love the snooze you can personlize it.
B002YCVX5S|5|Great Movie - was a gift
B000FS9FCG|5|Superlatives aside, this movie is a must-see for anyone who values their freedom.  But for those who don't care about being free, they should continue to text their friends and/or play their video games.<br /><br />In every way, this is a stunning production.  Acting, script, plot, cinematography, direction - it all comes together with a film like this.  . . . .  Plus, it (should) make us all think; not just about freedom, but also about the fear we hold inside that keeps us from stepping forward to claim our freedom.<br /><br />A magnificent production, I highly recommend it!
B009LH1Y1W|5|It's quick and so easy to do. It downlods real well and the picture and sound are great.And if used with amazon unbox it's that much better.
B00FJTYDKK|5|Nice i like it sow mush.
1476751447|5|Finally finished. Very interesting didn't realize what Clinton's went through after leaving office. Strong woman who will make an excellent President.
0345528581|2|The author has the view that intensive cardiovascular exercise is basically a waste of time and will not actually result in much weight loss or other benefits.  I don't pretend to be a physician or an expert but from my personal experience I would have to dispute that claim.<br /><br />The best shape I was ever in was when I was running 5 miles every day.  It took about 50-60 minutes and my body fat and overall weight were lower than they had ever been before or since.  My stamina and energy level increased dramatically and I felt great.  After a time I also got the \\"runners high\\" people speak of and I actually ENJOYED DOING IT.  I did a few other things like sit-ups (badly I might add) here and there but by far the focus was on my running.<br /><br />Certainly I could have used some strength training too in retrospect but to claim that aerobic exercise is not beneficial is false in my view.  He disparages it mainly because the actual calories burned are small during the workout itself but I would argue that your metabolic rate increases as well.  Again, I am no expert on the science but I did experience the benefits of cardio training first hand.<br /><br />I stopped doing it after a few years and I re-gained the weight I lost. It is one of my main regrets in life that I allowed that to happen. I also had heart surgery (not due to clogged arteries, a defect undetected I had since birth) and my doctors stressed the importance of doing cardiovascular rehab afterward which would of course involve some sort of aerobic activity.  Are the doctors just full of crap?  I don't believe so. I do believe in the benefits of strength training and muscle is far preferable to fat for many reasons as the author explains.  I just felt the need to speak up on the cardio issue.
B004OZOTSQ|5|By far the easiest way to move files to and from the phone. I had one question, and it was answered within an hour or so. In fact, had I been more diligent in searching for the answer I would have found it without bothering the dev. Still, I got a courteous and concise response, and I am a happy camper.
B0009P5YXO|4|I purchase this item for my Costume as a prop for Comic Con, and I was happy to get as fast as I did before the day I was supposed to get it. Sadly the item I had purchase was not the one on the picture that was shown and that really needs to be fix for future sales. It did not come with the wallet as explained in the Product Features or the Product Details. I am not sure why it would come with the UV pen to write with if they did not sale the wallet to go with it. Otherwise the Sonic Screwdriver itself seems fine I not really going to be playing with it but it dose serve for what I need it for.
B0094BB4TW|4|It has taken me a while to particapate on facebook. Ididn't want to be tied to a computer after work but I have found it is an easy way to keeep in touch with friends and family.
0743289412|1|Unless the story picks up tremendously after the first one fourth of the book...I just couldn't keep going.  It's sad too, I am a Stephen King fan.
B00IOVH8AW|1|I really hate this song, I had to download it for a work function. Worst $1 ive ever spent. I wanted to go shower after the purchase.....
B001VNB54A|5|I saw this special on HBO,when it originally aired,but there's nothing like watching it in Blu-ray!I recommend it to everyone who likes WW2 flicks,very graphic!
B00L9B7IKE|3|Was ok. The narrative, especially Rachel's, is tiresome. The ending came not quite unexpectedly. Some have compared it to Gone Girl but I did t find the characters as developed or as believable. But overall a good read.
B000089RVX|5|The CD is great, just enough metal to wake you up, but there is also a much softer side to it in Amy Lee's voice.  I LOVE it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is so addicting. Once you start playing it is hard to stop. It's like a workout for your brain!
B000VYX8PE|5|I recommend this book to every one who wants a great book!!!!!<br />This is not the only book that was wrote there's a whole series leading to the end!!!
B003EYVXTG|5|Astonishingly good film. A mystery/odyssey which looks uncompromisingly yet respectfully at a subculture filled with despair and danger where even the closest relationships involve caution and suspicion with great care taken to never give up an advantage or reveal anything which could ever possibly be used against you. One of the most genuinely human films I have seen.
B00000099Y|5|if you like them you will really like this cd i dont regret buying it there great! and its super cheap on amazon
B00J7UL6V6|5|I  am completely lost as to why so many people don't seem to like this album. Every single Black Keys album has had a slightly different sound than the last, and this is perhaps one of their more significant shifts. Some have said that they no longer sound like themselves and that they could be any generic band out there! What on earth are these people listening to?! Certainly not the album I heard! It sounds like a natural progression to me. To my ears it sounds like a significant Jimi Hendrix influence, which is a great thing, but it really doesn't sound quite like anyone but the Black Keys! Though I love their simpler, earlier sound, this is one of my favourite albums they have released! It is more interesting, subtle, atmospheric, and textured than many of their other albums. The first track alone is so great that it's worth buying the album for! I also love &#34;Turn Blue,&#34; &#34;It's Up to You Now,&#34; &#34;Waiting on Words,&#34; and &#34;10 Lovers.&#34;
B000HKYOK0|4|I like it because it is Star Trek.  I am 42 and grew up watching the reruns.  It would be impossible for me to give an unbiased review.
B00J2VSS0C|2|This was one of the very rare games I was willing to spend some money on until changes were made to make it a pain to play at all without continually spending money to get anywhere with it.  Ah well, guess it is time to get rid of it and locate a fun game.
B007TBZ63Y|5|This book was a awesome exiting thrill full of humor and a great on the edge if your seat ending. Rick hit it out of the ball park again.
B001EBWING|5|I have watched this movie dozens of times, and it causes me to think about the true meaning of the movie. This movie should be a required piece of literature, for college sophomores and above. everytime I watch it, it makes me cry, and to put myself in Rick's place. Only one out of 12-15 viewings, can I summon the internal courage to let Ilse leave with her husband. I know the the ethical arguments, favor letting her leave with her husband, but my romantic instincts are to keep her. If she has the love necessary to leave Laslo, she will eventually do it anyway. I have made arguments for and against her loving Rick, but I think that love is stronger than the one she elucidates for Laslo.I have done some ancillary reading and none of people involved in the making, thought the movie was any good.Time has certainly proven Bogie, and the other principles wrong in their judgement of the picture. I think it is one of the most gripping, and thought provoking movies ever made.
B00BAXFECK|4|This book is very well written and certainly held my interest.  I'm not sure whether this is a legitimate complaint, but I didn't much like the main character.  While the reader knows more or less what's in his mind, the character rarely speaks intelligently; so I couldn't understand what any other characters saw in him.  The story and the writing make it worthwhile.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Got it home, hooked it up without ant problems! So far it all seems to be working without a hitch!
B0058YPG1G|5|All Good. Thanks.
B004BCNVOA|4|Great!
B00HDMMISA|5|This book was nicely done. It is both a mystery and a comedy. Being a mother of elementary students myself I found it very relatable.
B00688628M|5|I've read books on this group of heroes.  I've tried to follow in their foots steps.  It's truly remarkable that they have walked on this earth
B00004Y6O9|3|Van Halen's influence on the world of rock music was probably the worst one that ever happened.  Eddie Van Halen, while surely talented, never did anything for me.  His guitar solos were never memorable in the same way many hard rock bands before him were.  His style was usually played with so much speed and intensity that I always have a tough enough time even keeping up with the notes, let alone finding any enjoyment out of it.  Once Eddie Van Halen arrived on the scene, mainstream rock music overall pretty much went downhill, and has remained that way for quite some time.      However, their debut album gets some points for having a few memorable songs.  They were able to create some catchy songs from time to time such as \\"Jamie's Cryin\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\".  Another good song is \\"Atomic Punk\\".  Other songs such as their cover of \\"You Really Got Me\\" is easily inferior to the great Kinks version, and \\"Runnin' With the Devil\\" is kind of boring.  I have no idea who thought \\"Ice Cream Man\\" was worth putting on record.    Overall, their debut will never be one of my favorites compared to so many other great records from the late 70's, but it's decent enough to recommend a purchase.
B004IDG97S|5|my husband loves this movie!.... me too
B00AESN8XY|5|In this game you play a virus that much keep mutating with the goal of destroying every human on earth.<br />Original. Interesting. And my favorite game in a long time. Not for kids, but a great adult game.<br />Looking forward to more games by this company.<br />5 stars easy.
B00HV2KPNW|5|My children love it! Was a great family movie, funny,and entertaining, looking forward to watch it again. Worth every penny...
B000VIK8D0|4|Got me interested in history of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday. The movie was reasonably accurate with good acting and lots of action.
B005GFPZYK|5|Great read.
B000QCS8TW|4|Although Game of Throne has all the usual trappings of medieval fantasy (knights in armor, tournaments, division of people into lords and ladies and the &#34;small  people,&#34; dragons, and sorcerers, its &#34;realistic&#34; characters, unexpected turns and twists, place the story in another new, fascinating, and utterly different category.  The other two books, the second is finished and I' m 20% through the third--make me hunger for more.
1439190275|5|Dr. Atkins was right on and it's a shame that the public, as such, doesn't use his approach.  This doctor was maligned for years when he was correct all along.  This book is his latest book, his first having come out in the 1970's.  You keep hearing things like he died from his own diet and that's a falsehood (unadulterated rubbish!!  He died because he slipped on ice, fell and hit his head, went into a coma and never came out of it).  Anyone can benefit from this book.  His diet is a low-carb diet and there are 4 phases and so easy to follow.  I am 16 lbs down with 12 to go.  America is fat from too many carbs, not too much fat!! If people only knew.  At any rate, buy this book and take it to heart.  I guarantee you, you will never be fat again in your life and you will never be hungry.  This book is worth every penny.
B0013KTGAG|5|Sunshine has an interesting means as to how it was shot, bringing independent practices to big Hollywood-style ideas and budget. From the film's opening you would not expect to find a suspense/thriller climax, but it was handled pleasantly and adequately. As well, the film opens your mind to the impermanence of life and whether or not we should extend our welcome in the universe.
B009JBZH54|5|Got this Blu-Ray set on sale.  It is great to have the entire trilogy on Blu-Ray and the special features are entertaining as well.
B007IXWKUK|5|I like it even tho most people say it is poorly written
B007HJ84ZK|5|I liked the books, I LOVE the show.  The books tend to be long winded and broken up, and it was hard to keep track off all the players.  This took the best parts of the books and reduced them to a thoroughly enjoyable series.  Can't wait for season two to be posted!
B00B8WXFWE|4|Not as good as the old days ...
0062107313|3|I didn't think this book was even close to some of the author's previous works.  I was an okay read for me, but I had bought it as a gift for my husband, and he passed it me after two chapters.  He didn't enjoy any of the characters.
0316056863|2|Got about 1/3 of the way through the book and lost interest. Didn't find it that funny or engaging.  Maybe it needed an Alec Baldwin for the comedy to work or something, but if you're a fan of Tina Fey, I would recommend sticking with episodes of 30 Rock.
0060934913|5|I happened to catch an episode of \\"No Reservations\\" and became mesmerized by this \\"swashbuckling\\" (one of the recurring adjectives applied to Bourdain) and sexy...CHEF???  Those people in funny hats & funnier pants?  So when a friend loaned me \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" I...well...ate it up faster than a creme brulee at les Halles. Bourdain is a piece of work...drug fiend, Nine Inch Nails headbanger, filthy-mouthed guttersnipe, genius and really, really good writer!  His love of food is poetic, his advice on necessary kitchen utensils and pantry supplies quite useful, and his strolls down memory lane both hilarious and cringingly icky. I'm planning a trip to NYC with the express object of eating at Les Halles...on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  Heaven forbid I should go on the weekend!!
B00009RAJH|5|Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 classic is often over shadowed by the bohemoth success of Rumours.  This is without a doubt one of the most significant reinventions in rock and roll history.  Gone is the hard driving blues rock fleetwood mac led by the guitar god Peter Green (a fabulous line up in its own right), here is the laid back west coast stylings of a band that would come to dominate the mid 70's with thier california sound.  It all began while Mick Fleetwood was hanging out with his buddy kieth olsen a music engineer. Olsen played a song from an album by a then unknown Buckingham Nicks.  Mick loved what he heard and later asked Buckingham to join the band.  Buckingham only agreed to join if his then girlfriend Stevie could join.  The rest is music history.  This album is a bit lighter and more optimistic than rumours.  The song writing is still outstanding each player handling their parts flawlessly.  Obvious highlights would be Say You Love Me, Rhiannon, and Over My Head (all charting). There is more than just the hits that make this album great.  Crystal was written by Nicks but sung by Buckingham.  It is a gorgeous pastoral number that evokes such a peacful mood with its soft melodies.  World turning is a bit of a tribute to the sound of the orginal fleetwood mac.  Its a stomping blues rock number with both Linday Buckingham and Chritine Mcvie providing vocals. And then thiers the fan favorite Landslide, a song that wasnt releasd as a single until 1998 putting fleetwood mac back on the charts nearly 3 decades after its initial release.  The album deservedly reached number one on the charts.
B00000DR5I|5|If you've never heard any early electronic-ambient TD, buy this CD. This sequenced cosmic masterpiece is the only recording I've ever owned in LP, cassette,and CD formats--wearing out each one (except the CD) with successive listenings. Although somewhat short at 35 minutes, Rubycon is nonetheless guaranteed to send your senses soaring to other worlds.  Mere words cannot give adequate justice to its moody intensity, startling one moment and relaxing the next. A friend of mine once claimed he &quot;saw God&quot; listening to Rubycon on his Walkman as he camped in the Utah desert. Multiple listenings to this layered sequencer symphony and you might agree.  TD's best, by far.
B004HZ76FQ|5|Take the time to go through the tutorial, well worth it. Fun game once you get the hang of it. Having some difficulty taking pictures of my catch, camera disappears quickly, but I'll keep trying, I'm hooked!
B00HWWUQWQ|5|Love it!
B0010AN7Y0|5|\\"Peter's Friends\\" is the British \\"Big Chill.\\" And while it may be a stretch to see yourself among this ensemble of Brits gathering to celebrate New Year's Eve in a castle, you can relate to their dilemma; in a way, growing up sucks. But the warmth of their friendship, the obvious bond of the actors and a great script and stellar soundtrack will put this one on the top of your favorites list. And if you're just discovering Hugh Laurie (\\"House\\"), this shows you a completely different side of him.
B0009XNUK0|5|Some songs from my childhood

B00FAPF5U0|4|It is a fun game and a challenge, but I am sure there are other games that are just as much fun and maybe even more of a challenge and that I why I did not give it a 5.
B00N1HONIO|4|Surprisingly horrifying, sit down in a dark room with headphones.
0062502182|5|I was watching a late night talk show and saw Will Smith recommend this book. I'm impressed with it.
B000KCHZK6|1|I own all Norah Jones' CDs and DVDs - I think she is extremely talented. But I really do not care what musicians think about politics, they are far from being well informed. If Norah Jones wants to use her music for political attacks, it's her right of course.  But I have the right to vote with my dollars and add her to list that includes Dixie Chicks, Mel Gibson, etc. - they will not get any more money from me.    Alice Cooper said it best:    \\"If you're listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to vote for, you're a bigger moron than they are. Why are we rock stars? Because we're morons. We sleep all day, we play music at night and very rarely do we sit around reading the Washington Journal.\\"
B005C7SXMS|4|A lot of films strive to 'place' the viewer in the place of the protagonist of the story.  To cause the viewer to feel and sympathize with the hero of the film, and cheer him on.  It's difficult to think of a film that does just this more productively than 'Submarine'.  I went into it knowing nothing about the movie, and came out of it feeling like I had just spent time with a close friend.<br /><br />Ultimately, 'Submarine' is an exploration of a young man's adolescent failures and tiny successes, but every thought that 'Oliver Tate' (our hero) stammers aloud is met with touches of humor, confusion, anger, conflict, romance and anxiety from both the cast around him and the audience.  'Submarine' is perfectly cast and hits its mark time and time again.  I had a great time hanging out with Oliver and his family, and reliving the awkwardness and thrills of young love and adolescence.<br /><br />A great directorial debut from Richard Ayoade (yes, the guy with the afro on 'The IT Crowd')... I can't wait to see where he takes us next.
B00UTJ9C1U|2|who was that little kid anyway???
B000QRIGLC|4|I was moved and interested by the descriptions of the US Navy Seals and what they do.  It seemed, on occassion that Luttrell was a little self-serving in his narration, but overall, I was fascinated by the story of these brave warriors.
030758836X|5|This is a great book. I got thoroughly caught up in this book. Flynn builds her story well and makes it quite intriguing.
B0054JZC6E|5|it gives you 117 games. their short games,  but still fun. you even have to get tockens from the games alreadly unlocked to unlock other games...that's the only bad part.
B004SOR4H6|2|Seems like every time I decide to give Twitter another chance, I'm unable to enjoy it because of the format. In my account, I only want to see posts from the people I approve and likewise, I only want specific people to be able to see my posts.<br /><br />Structuring my personal page to fit my desires is NOT the easiest thing to do on my Commando or Kindle but, if I sign in on my laptop I can figure it out pretty quickly.<br /><br />Not my favorite user-friendly social outreach.
B00000JPH0|5|I give this film 5 stars not so much for its storyline or plot (which is virtually non-existant) but for its attempt to show a little known conflict.  The combat scenes in this movie are intense.  The waves of Soviet infantrymen throwing themselves upon the Mannerheim line gives the viewer a good idea what it must have been like for the Finns.  The production value of this film is superb.  Those are authentic Soviet T-26 light tanks, and early Yak Fighters.  Again, don't look at this movie if you want to see a human interest story or standard plot.  The intent of this work is docu-drama.  The film accurately shows what the Finns did to resist the Soviet onslaught of 1939-40.  There is not much character development here, pretty much all the Finns look like another, but what you see is a gritty determination of a small nation to defend itself against Stalin's tyranny.  In the end of course the Finns had to make unfortunate concessions, but few modern wars show a more inspiring image of a small determined people fighting for their survival.  This  film is worth looking at for its marvalous combat scenes, equippment, and sheer grit.  This is certainly a guys movie par excellenece.  If you are inspired by it you should read the fine recent history of the conflcit entitled &quot;A Frozen Hell&quot;
0345803507|2|The books went down hill after the first one, I would not recomend waisting your time on this book or the second one, it's the same thing over and over.
B000056BB3|5|Have the tissue ready if you're a dog lover!  What a fantastic family film...about the bond between a yong boy and his dog Skipper (Skip).  You watch the entire cast \\"growing up\\" in love, family and friendship.  The cast is superb and the movie is a must for the entire family.  If you don't shed a tear, you may be heartless.  This one got me good.
B009UX2YAC|5|Out of all of the games I play this is my favorite. I also like that you can upgrade to different countries
B00J2PCCYQ|3|I do not have any children, but I still enjoy the Pixar and Disney films so I thought i would try this movie.<br />If you can get passed the LARGE amount of singing in the first part of the movie ( Let it Go was the only good song on it too ) then the movie was worth watching. The ending had a great message for girls and the snowman was pretty funny.<br />Pretty cute movie.
1400034205|5|I loved the book...good social satire, interesting and well developed characters, interesting plot.  Very witty writing, too.
B005GVA2L0|5|Love this new CD.  Heavy Evanescence fan.  The behind the scenes was a nice feature, fell like you get to know the band a bit better and understand where the music comes from.<br /><br />You will enjoy this.<br /><br />Tom
B000GPI2CM|3|Based on reviews I have read, it compelled me to get it. But boy, was I disappointed. This CD will stay in its case for a long time.
B001GCUO16|4|X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 2009 origin story for wolverine. This film is directed by Gavin Hood and produced by and starring Hugh Jackman. It co-stars Liev Schreiber, Lynn Collins, Taylor Kitsch, will.i.am, Kevin Durand, Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney and Ryan Reynolds. The film is a prequel focusing on the violent past of the mutant Wolverine and his relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed. The plot details Wolverine's childhood as James Howlett (Troye Sivan), his early encounters with Major William Stryker, his time with Team X, and the bonding of Wolverine's skeleton with the indestructible metal adamantium during the Weapon X program.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00846REIS|1|I normally don't leave reviews but I use them when determining what book to read next.  I have been misled with this one.  Were my expectations too high?  First of all, I am not sure what the point of this book was.  The plot is boy and girl meet and engage in a fast relationship with little depth, with girl becoming constantly jealous and running away to have guy follow her and make things all better with sex (again, no depth).  This was essentially an account a hallow relationship.  Not sure if my expectations were too high and I just missed what others read, but I just don't see how there is any basis for another book (as there really was no reason for this one, other than the literary porn).
B00364K6J2|5|A great movie for young and old.  In the place of curse words, the characters will say cuss...&#34;as an example, Mr. Fox might say, What the cuss do you think you are doing?&#34; (instead of what the hell do you...).  I highly recommend it!
B009ZQC7MY|5|I love this show! It's the main reason that I signed signed up for Amazon Prime. I could watch it all day.

B00AREIAI8|5|Great app for animal lovers. I love horses; they are such beautiful creatures.  This is a great app! I recommend this app for everyone who has a soft spot for animals.
B004GJXQ20|5|I bought this book, and i just read straight through until Martin's 5th book in the series. Would recommend it to anyone even moderately interested in fantasy.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Omg i love this game its fun and challenging its fun to play for ages  10 and up have fun
B005OCFGTO|5|The 8 discs cover years 1-7 at Hogwarts. They are just copies of the orginal films. So if you have seen the films you will find the same on the dvds. The recordings are very good quality I did not find a flaw in any of the discs. All of the discs  are in english or spanish and some of them are also in french. It was a very good buy for the money.

1933952806|5|I found Darrell Young's book on the D90 to be very helpful. So when I got the D7000 I bought his book on this camera. With the D90 book, I unlocked many options that I had missed in three years of shooting. But now, with my D7000, I'll get that capability right from the start.
B003L77G6A|5|This show is excellent.  I've been watching it since the first season and have have been buying each season to fill in the gaps when I've missed an episode.  Each episode is so funny on it's own that it doesn't matter if you watch them in order.  And they're just as funny the second time around.
B0064MPXFA|4|I have just started watching The Good Wife. A review would be somewhat premature.
0441172717|4|This is defiantly one of the most monumental novels of the century. The story is good, and pretty well written, but it has it's moments of completely and inexcusably boring &amp; or stupid parts. I find that some  of the descriptions are a little on the tedious side, but maybe that's just  because I'm pretty young. I might learn to appreciate the depth of it, as I  grow older. I find that descriptions in &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;  series are much more interesting then the ones Herbert writes. I also found  it disturbing that the book went into so much detail of the Fremen life and  religion. I know that this might be interesting for some people, but for me  it was down right boring and not needed! And again, like with most long  novels, the author could have told the story in half the pages! With all of  the above rants, I must say that I did enjoy reading this book, but I  really don't understand how it has such a strong following. Probably the  best character development was with the Harkonnen's which are the evil  guys. The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was a very interesting character, as was  his nephew the co-baron Feyd-Rautha. The best parts of the book are the  first 200 pages, and then it starts to go down hill from there until the  climatic last battle, which was superb! I can't give this book a full five  stars because it was not the best I have read. I would, however, recommend  it for people, but I'd even more recommend books by such authors as  Tolkien, and Jordan. The ending of &quot;Dune&quot; was a bit of a cliff  hanger, so I'm going to be going to read the next book in the series  &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; hoping that the series will get even better as I  go along. Enjoy the book!
B00NXL7GIM|5|Very pleased.  Have watched it repeatedly.
B004VMVTNU|4|A recent update made a change to the math - based alarms, they don't seem to be able to increase number of questions after each snooze, taking away that great feature loses a star for me.
386521584X|5|A fantastic book. Was looking for a book to spark and inspire my skill set and found it in &#34;The Americans&#34;. Classic shots and all black and white pictures. This collection was assembled in the &#34;old days&#34; and what great shots, before the thought process of snap a few hundred and something will be good. The were from the days when every shutter click cost money and you wanted to get everything right.  Great motivator and a must have for the up and coming photographer.
B00QVZ1VXI|5|Almost every track in this album was great. I don't usually buy the whole thing, but wow, totally worth it this time around. I also love how Amazon doesn't load their audio files with DRM, so once you get them downloaded, they're yours. The only downside is the frankly stupid Amazon Music software they make you use to download it, but I mean. If I'm willing to put up with Origin existing on my computer, than I guess I don't have too much of a right to complain about Amazon Music, even if it's really dumb.
B00005BJ2O|2|don't get me wrong, on its own this is a fine enough album. BUT, it's missing some of the best numbers in the film, and i'd much rather hear John Leguizamo sing &quot;nature boy&quot; (as he did in the film) instead of the faux-coolness of David Bowie. where is &quot;like a virgin?&quot; where is &quot;spectacular spectacular?&quot; and where is &quot;zidler's rap?&quot;  i hope they release a CD that plays ALL the music &amp; songs from the movie, in their proper order. meanwhile, this album only makes me hunger for the songs it's missing.
0385732554|2|This book took about 3 hours to read from cover to cover, and I am glad that I didn't invest any more time in it than that. (It also reminded me of why I have not bothered with fiction for so many years.)<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />1. We don't have any explanation of how this situation came to be. At least in \\"Animal Farm,\\" there is something to explain how the events came to be. Nor do we clearly understand the ending of the book. It had one of those bailout endings. (Imagine the author thinking \\"How do I end this thing? Oh, I don't know. Let's just give it an ending.\\")<br /><br />2. We don't know where are these people with respect to everyone else in the world. Did everyone else just mysteriously vanish leaving these people to live this life?<br /><br />3. There were a few too many elements borrowed from other dystopian novels. So, we did notice that Lowry showed characters who made up compound words to describe things that would have been distasteful to them. (\\"Release\\"=death; \\"newchild\\"=baby, etc.)<br /><br />4. These topics are way too heavy for this to be a children's book. I understand what Lowry was getting at in most instances (\\"What is pleasure without pain?\\" or \\"If you never have to struggle to survive, how do you appreciate surviving?\\"), but one comes away with the impression that this was just overall poorly done. She could have chosen one SIMPLE theme and stuck with it-- so as to make the book suitable for children. (How many childrens' books need Cliffs' notes for goodness sake?)<br /><br />5. Can people really be modified this much? The point of human beings is to make more DNA (and not the other way around). Can people so easily be trained to abandon their sexual feelings or their babies? People see colors before they can describe them in words. How do you train someone to not understand that? Perhaps it is good that this book *was* written for kids, because at this point in time, the feats that would have been necessary to make these people could not have been believed by any reasonable adult (that had sat through Bio 101).<br /><br />I would pay, at most, $1 for this book-- but not for my children. Just to read it out of curiousity/ morbid interest.ult (that had sat through Bio 101).    I would pay, at most, $1 for this book-- but not for my children.

B0094LZY2A|5|This is one of what I call &#34;MY Happy Movies&#34; and what I mean by that is that being 67 I find it to be a  very scary time in ones life. Thus, when one  is trying to survive in so many categories!<br />So, to get out of my head and have some &#34;stop thinking&#34;  about all the above I find a get away that costs only pennies a month and I go to wherever the movie might take me!  May be  silly but it works for an hour or two!!!!!
B00G3L6KQI|5|When I first came across the All Souls trilogy I thought I had found something intelligent and educational, but I soon discovered that the book series became much more. I was able to make parallels to my life which made the characters even more likeable and the situations more personable.<br /><br />I will read this series again and again; it will remain on my shelf next the Harry Potter series forever. I will always recommend this book to anyone. I may not admit this in person but I laughed, and cried a lot in these books. I may have shed more tears while reading the last chapters of this series than any book before (and I read a lot of books). If you are considering a purchase you will not be disappointed. Matthew and Diana have become best friends over the years of waiting for each installment (be glad you do not have to wait like I did to finish the series). The purchase of this book will not be regretted.
030788743X|5|This is the best book I've read since Lev Grossman's \\"The Magician's\\", which is actually somewhat similar in it's plot: A teenage boy of above average intelligence is given a chance to become something greater than he is, if he works hard at it.  That type of plot is the basis for many, many other novels, but these two rise about the sterotype.
0316069353|1|I was awating this new release.  But I refuse to pay more for an e-book that for a hardback, so I will just pass on both. At this rate I can wait sever months or so for the paperback.
B00FPM4IRO|4|Controls are a little hard to handle but overall good game
B00005YW4H|4|There's a good, friendly, quiet, relaxed emotion in this music and that's really what I like about it.<br /><br />Some reviewers here have said, it's not \\"exciting\\" \\"jarring\\" and yeah, that's why I like it... I don't always feel like being jarred or excited.  One said \\"nice, but just doesn't say much\\"  Personally, I don't always wanna be told something either...  I'm quite glad when I get a break from all the overzealous people and their big messages...  I'm pleased when they don't overstack their music with (mostly contrived) excitement, when they don't try to convince me of their \\"brandnew\\" sort of wisdom.<br /><br />This music appeals to me because of what is there just as much as because what she leaves out.<br /><br />Some reviewer here panned the album, calling it boring, followed up with a recommendation to buy duran duran albums instead, pointing out how they go platinum within days of release.  I really had to laugh... that's a different genre of music.  If you're a metallica fan, sure, you might want to avoid this album, but for others, I think the tracks amazon lets us listen to here  speak for themselves.
0767903862|5|This is one of those books that's best read when it falls into your lap as a break from other books. One day you're slogging your way through a tome of ungodly proportions, wondering how in God's name this book ever got published, when a book like IASC falls into your lap and you pounce on it with the enthusiasm of a bobcat devouring a goat. Soon you find you must shirk all of your daily duties until the book is finished. This, people, is not only the mark of a good book, it is the mark of a good travel book. Even better is one that makes you want to visit Australia--which is remarkable when you consider Australia has more imaginative and horrible ways to kill you than pretty much any other place on earth. It's Earth's second most inhospitable climate (the first is Antarctica).   But all Antartica can do is kill you with its cold. Australia is home to fluffy caterpillars that can kill you, species of spiders that can kill you with just a pinprick of venom, and the world's deadliest snake: the taipan. (Interesting fact: the taipan is fifty times more venomous than the world's second deadliest snake, the cobra. You get bit by a taipan and it's bye bye baby, goodbye.) Not to mention, there are sharks, poisonous jellyfish (\\"blueys\\"), and man-eating crocodiles. And desert. Lots and lots of unforgiving desert. While most Australians aren't bothered by the rest of the lot, the crocodiles even scare them.   That said, Bryson makes Australia--a country, he notes, to which Americans pay little attention (Russell Crowe notwithstanding)--sound like the world's friendliest and warmest place on planet Earth. Australians do sound like a very friendly and welcoming folk. That they managed to make a country at all is to their immense credit, though, according to Bryson, they'll not thank you for mentioning that their country essentially started off as a penal colony. (The \\"criminals,\\" by the way, were not at all a bad lot; many were only there because of harsh sentences that were common for the lower classes in England at the time. If you stole five cucumbers, you could choose between your own hanging or ... a move to Australia.)  There were many places in the book where Bryson made me burst out laughing. I tried to read a passage to a friend, but I could barely get it out because I was laughing too hard. And he's not just good as a humorist, either. He's great at the factual stuff. What otherwise might be dry and sleep-inducing comes alive in Bryson's writing, and he kept me as riveted as any high-octane novelist. He truly is a delight to read, and I can't wait to read more of his books. Highly recommended.

B001ANSS5K|5|Easy to relate to, I couldn't put it down! it's funny, sad, hopeful, heroic, and reckless. I would recommend it over and over and over.
6300213803|5|Zowie!  What the Star Wars films did with grand, whole-fleet battles, this movie does with ship-vs-ship, one-on-one space action.  But it's more than that.  The characters are richly developed, Ricardo Montalban makes one of the best-ever movie villains, and the cliffhanger ending tugs right at your heart.
0062209493|5|Gift for my husband and my dad. They both loved it and I loved hearing the stories they recounted from it!

B005ELQVGW|2|Back in the day when Bjork came up in conversation, the conversation was usually followed with something like: \\"The beats are SWEEEEET, and her vocals blended with the beat... AAAAMAZING!!\\"............. What is going on with the last two albums?? The critics who once hated her now love her, and the fans get the finger????? Do we have to wait for a remix cd to get the complex house beats that she WAS known for??? It's cool to dabble with new ideas, but don't forget your roots.... and the rest of us you left behind. P.S. We still love her, just throw us a bone.
B000000OY9|4|everyone i know or don't says this album sucks and is deffinately not Young's best, but i don't know what everyone's complaining about. This album retains the same song writing quality as any Young album, if anything  it's  great exploration into things lost and things to come. Yes, i'd  rather here him with his acoustic guitar or crazy horse but it shouldn't  matter what style of music you use but the actual songs.
0891419063|5|One of the best books I've ever read. I stumbled upon the HBO series The Pacific on my Amazon Prime a few months ago. After watching the series, I knew I had to read Sledge's book. I'm so glad I did. HIGHLY recommend this book. His writing style and attention to detail is amazing. So thankful for those brave men who fought for my freedom. So thankful.
B007G3H8Y0|4|Lots of really upbeat catchy songs although you can hear where Patrick is singing about his life experiences. Especially like Mermaid
B0002XDODU|5|I have never been disappointed with this band, almost everything they do I love. Their latest work features two songs fairly typical of their style, Reise Reise and Mein Teil, even in Mein Teil Till explores more vocal range. Dalai Lama is my personal favorite just for its different structure and wide range of vocals. A previous reviewer mentioned Amerika as sounding rather pop, I think that was intentional as the song derides American cultural imperialism, including music.  <br />  I think Till's delving into poetry also helped him develop his lyrical skills as many of the songs feature more intricate lyrics some make use of clever word play.  <br />  A great album that shows the band growing as artists of 'Music designed to annoy your parents' 'Paul Landers'

B001EN71CW|4|Really liked this series.  Wish it would have lasted longer.
B0001NBMBC|2|i agree with most of these posts...it seems as though slipknot has forgotten why they have such a strong fanbase and tried to change their sound...i heard that this was going to be the hardest album yet but that couldn't be farther from the truth...many of the songs sound very &quot;stone-sour-ish&quot;...and this is their last cd?!?!...i've heard that it's better to burn than fade away and this cd is definitely fading away from my cd collection...
B004Z2TUGE|3|This is another super-hero movie, with a twist off the norm. I found it entertaining and the quality was very good. The plot was a little close to superman---aliens fighting a war across the galaxy and ending up on earth --type of plot, but done in away different enough to entertain as a 'new twist&#34; on an old usbject.

0800132009|5|The last line sums it up very well, but I guess that's what war does to people. People are changed in many ways by it, and this is a good example of that. William Holden plays another roguish character who gets turned head-over-heels once more in his mission, as does Alec Guiness. Whatever the case, the movie starts out rather slow, then kicks it in as Holden joins the Canadian and the Britt on thier mission to destroy the bridge. Meanwhile, Alec Guiness and his men struggle to build that bridge and take pride in it.  Guiness's character is rather interesting. In some ways he's a very resolute man, yet in others somewhat fooled by his own resolution. Once again, that's what war and imprisonment do to you.<br />The climax is quite the nail-biter as you see person after person fall... But I won't spoil the whole bloody thing. Still, everyone seems driven on by their own different senses of pride and that, in the end, is what is their mutual downfall. The only person who seems to have a grip on reality by the end of this all is the doctor. And, I should mention, he's the one who stands on the riverbed looking at the battle-scarred area around him screaming 'Madness! Madness!' as the credits start to roll.<br />Very good movie. Reccomended.
1936608898|5|I've voraciously read pretty much every Primal/Paleo/Gary Taubes/Michael Pollan-esque book out there in the quest for better health, but this is hands down my new favorite food and wellness book and the one that will be the most dog-eared and highlighted in my collection. Unlike other books I've read, I didn't just learn about food itself - I learned a lot about fixing my relationship with it. I now understand what's really responsible for my food cravings, why my body reacts the way it does to the things I eat, and how to improve my health through diet - all backed by extensive research, but written in laymen's terms.<br /><br />Thank you, Dallas and Melissa, for taking my knowledge to the next level and giving me a sense of empowerment to finally overcome many years of food cravings and addictions. I never thought it was possible, but I now have a relationship with food that encourages optimal health instead of making mindless emotional choices.
B00B7IJDMA|5|I love listening to the soundtrack while I'm patiently waiting for Season 4 to start. Nice mix, maybe a little too short.
B001PJ7TUE|3|There's no doubt the Prodigy personify the ultimate fusion of rock and dance music.    Ever since \\"The fat of the land\\" no one else managed as well as them to capture the excitement and immediacy inherent in both genres. \\"Invaders must die\\" recalls elements of the Prodigy's great past with its constant refrain in the title track and a build up of tension like a call to arms, reminding us how exciting an act they are (especially as a live prospect).    \\"Omen\\"  sounds like another blast from the past. \\"Colours\\" is like the silly sample from a fruit machine that no one should have thought of but \\"Take me to the hospital\\" soon gets things back on track with its combination of high energy, aggression and dread. \\"Thunder\\" has the impact of the noise it describes and \\"Warrior's dance\\" - again recalls their 90's past. \\"Run with the wolves\\" - more of the same really...but still fun.    With \\"Omen reprise\\" simply being a filler, one might be tempted to conclude the Prodigy have run out of ideas and are simply regurgitating old formulae. But something always niggles at the back of your mind saying they've yet to fulfil their potential and will any moment spring a surprise on you.    Unfortunately that surprise doesn't happen here but there's enough to suggest greater things are possible.    \\"Worlds on fire\\" is probably one of the most effective but simply expressed messages of urgency about the state of the world I've heard in a long time with its minimal use of words accompanied by a bristling bassline and \\"Piranha\\" is the soundtrack to a nightmarish 50's B-movie on acid. \\"Stand up\\" holds no surprises but at least keeps things moving.     Having actually bought everything this lot have produced since their 1992 debut and \\"The fat of the land\\", I wouldn't say this was their best piece of work - just a routine and solid offering dutifully delivered to their continuously sizeable fan base.    I hope in future the Prodigy can do something more complex. They've got the formula forinspiring energy in a crowd patented and locked down but the transition between `good' and `great' will take much more than what they've delivered here. Let's hope it happens soon while they're still young enough to leap about the stage and electrify the dance floor which this record is ideal for and manages quite efficiently.
B00007EDY5|5|This is required when using strobes and not wanting to use the external hot shoe flash for firing the strobes. It works extremely well. The only thing I don't like is that it has only 1 port for one strobe for cable syncing, you cannot use more than one cable at a time. Typically you can shoot and one strobe will fire giving out a signal for the other strobe to fire, this doesn't always work out wonderfully 'lighting wise' for some reason. I am a photography student so I am still learning. It is very affordable and great to have when using one strobe light, unless you're a pro at studio lighting.
B000JMKTLO|4|Compelling, good mystery.  However it was difficult to comprehend that a 13 year-old did many of things this author wrote.
B00PB5AO4G|5|It's great! It doesn't matter if you don't know what you are doing:-). It's great for all ages. It's great as a time-waster for retired seniors like myself or toddlers just beginning to learn about the internet. I myself am not interested in competition so I don't use the connections to Facebook, Twitter or any other social network site to play. It's fine to just play and feel silly!
B00CLD65X0|5|I had to marathon watch the entire series and can't wait until Season 6 comes out in 2016.  I would also google and read about the characters.  I admit I was hoping Mary would marry Tom Branson instead of him going off to America with his daughter.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love it!! what else is there to say lol... you have to get this one. if you dont get any more, get this one for sure
B007J4T2G8|5|This book is far too good to miss out on. It will leave you wanting more. It'll leave you wanting you're very own Christian Grey. I highly recommend reading it before watching the movie. The movie is beyond what words can explain.
B00BGIC2J2|3|Definitely would have benefited by bringing along all of the original cast. It was alright, just expected more. Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B00GINENG0|5|This is hilarious. It keeps my kids occupied and it's clean.  Mom and kid-friendly.
B009AOFNU4|3|Seriously, this thing is so tiny it's almost ridiculous. I have very small hands and yet I found my hands cramping after a short period of time. Nevertheless, the construction is flat-out amazing. I never worried about it getting damaged when I put it in my pocket, and yes it's small enough that I could do that. Outstanding battery life too, for the time I had it (at least a week) I never had to recharge it.<br /><br />Ultimately, the smallness of the unit made it uncomfortable to use for any real length of time. I ended up purchasing a Moga Power A which is larger, but has much better ergonomics. It's a shame, this thing was very expensive and I had high hopes.
0767834739|5|This movie was good  lot of action and Zombies all over the place and a evil corperation trying to kill everyone in sight and continue their experments. It all so makes the debut of  Jill Valentine who strangely is not part of the S.T.A.R.S Unit with Carlos Olivera who was left behind by the Corperation.      Alice Returns kicking ass and has clearly improved since the first movie, due to the effects of the Experments  Umbrella were doing to her.      The Basis of the Story is Alice, Jill, Carlos and others try to survive, get out of the city and rescue a young girl  all before a missle goes off by the corperation  that will kill every single person or zombie and the virus.      the big bad  monster from Resident Evil 3 shows up  Nemesis which makes things harder for the group.       A fun movie lot of action and  one I recommend you watch and add to your collection.
B0034DGPEU|4|Hard to put down.  I was surprised to find out this was the author's first novel.  Very well written and researched.  There are a lot of characters and at first I was afraid I'd get overwhelmed keeping them straight, but their characters are so well defined, it was easy keeping them straight.  A bit of a dark read, but well worth it.
B00D2CYU2W|1|nasty movie
B006WQLH7G|5|Good protection and free
B004GUSG4M|4|Very good, it got a bit repetitive in the middle, and I kept wondering if there was going to be a big surprise or twist, or something, and finally it delivered! Great ending!
B00AAQRNQ8|5|I've had this mouse for over a year and still use it with more customization options and features than my friends with razer products.
0345535529|5|I've just finished Book 4 and getting into Book 5. The series is phenomenal and I've reviewed each book separately here on Amazon. I ordered this boxed set for Xmas for myself just to display it and enjoy seeing it at home. I've leafed through some of the pages, and still LOVE reading actual books but the digital Kindle versions work so much better. The boxed set is beautiful, it arrived on time, and the books have a snug fit. It's a lovely collection to display and it reminds me just how much I love the imagination of GRMM that has brought about this new universe of fantasy and imagination to life.
B004LWZW7E|1|This is one boring movie! Every scene is like a WTF scene! It gets old fast! No action, crappy script and it goes nowhere. Every time, you want something to happen and it never does. Terrible terrible movie. Fine actors gone to waste. No emotions, no substance. This whole movie could have been half its length if the scenes didn't drag on. It was very repetitive.
1451648545|5|Great!
B006LSZECO|4|There is nothing earth shattering about this novel.  However, it is well written (which can't always be said about popular novels) and the story is engaging, if sometimes a bit predictable.  I have seen other authors try to write a story from two perspectives and fail, but Gillian Flynn pulls it off nicely.<br /><br />This is the first book of hers that I have read and the best compliment I can give this book is that her writing style appeals to me enough to want to read her earlier works.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how they make this into a movie.
B008ASGP3U|5|I am a big fan of the 'John Rebus' series of novels by Ian Rankin. 'Standing in Another Man's Grave' is no disappointment.  It is a hard-hitting serial murder case that doesn't pull any punches. It's also about the return of John Rebus from the 'retired' category.  He hasn't changed and that's the good part! He is cantankerous and hard-drinking - - unforgiving to criminals and thumbs his nose to 'superior' authority.  The folks in Scotland should sleep better at night with John Rebus back on the hunt for villains!
1401924751|5|There are those of us who scamper in circles, gazing at the thing we know we want to do, but wanting it so much that we can't bring ourselves to try it in case we fail.     I brought these cards at random after they jumped out at me at a bookshop. I'd been looking at them on Amazon many times, but figured that as I already have 11 decks, I don't need another one.... But I am mindful of the thing where your Angels throw books at your head in a bookstore, so I brought them.    They are very beautiful - the colours are bright and clear and the illustrations are quite lovely. I looked at each one in turn, cleared and attuned the deck, and then did a simple three card reading. The first one that I turned up said \\"You have a book inside you\\" at which point I had to stop to burst into tears, and then laugh, and then burst into tears again. Once I had finished honking and giggling, and managed to pull myself together, I did the rest of the reading - about music helping me and being on my path. Yes, I have been a writer for many, many years now. I don't actually make money out of it :) I don't submit my work for publication :) Except the occasional poem, which often gets published :)    I didn't really expect these to work, let alone to be so accurate on a first reading. I am now looking at her other decks to see if any of them resonate as well....     My overall review is: spookily accurate, and highly recommended.    PS: I have the writing journal, now I am waiting for guidance on what to write about !
B00000JCB2|1|I don't know how many times I can say this, but Fred Durst and his lame  band have NO talent!! I don't know why this band is so popular! the lyrics  are the STUPIDIST Things I've ever heard on any album!! I really don't see  how a band that puts nothing in to their music or fan relationships are so  respected! It makes no sence! why can't all these mindless people open up  their eyes and see what a jerk Fed Drst is! He is not worthy of being  called a musician! This album may be the worst album I've ever heard in my  life, but I have a feeling that their next one will be worse! I mean what  kind of name is choclate starfish and the hot dog flavord water!?! I've  heard 2 songs off this album, and I for one will not waste my money! If you  really want to hear some limp bizkit, go and babysit your baby brother, the  meeningless sounds coming out of his mouth, make alot more sence then  Fred's lyrics, or this bands music!
B007ATNHLI|4|Worst movie ever. I opened the box from Amazon and inside was just a hat. It didn't fit in my blu-ray player or anything.    Update: Amazon quickly sent out the appropriate product via overnight shipping, so I got what I ordered like three days after the \\"guaranteed delivery\\" date.     I think this movie is hilarious. Tommy Lee Jones plays the ultra-serious government agent and Will Smith plays, well, Will Smith. The interaction between the two is pretty funny. The visual effects are good for the time; some are cheesy but I think this was more for comedic purposes. The script is fairly well written, you actually care about the characters as they develop throughout the story arc. This doesn't qualify as a \\"spoof\\" film, but it is far from a serious scifi flick.
B00BEZTMFY|5|I loved the Fellowship of the Ring trilogy and the Hobbit was awesome! I can't wait to see the Desolation of Smaug!
0380807343|5|I picked up this book because mostly because I really like Mirrormask, so a kids book from the same creative minds sounded really awesome. Little did I know that it would be quite possibly the creepiest and unsettling thing I've read in a very long time. Keep in mind that I'm 19, like psychological thrillers and can't be fazed by books like Steven King or what-not ninety-nine times out of a hundred. This book spends not a word more than it needs to and it was pretty ridiculously terrifying. Possibly just because I think people with buttons for eyes is the most disturbing thing ever. Not to mention people unzipping their skins and whatever other semi-drug induced nightmares lie within this book  But yeah, this is totally going next to my John Bellairs collection and will be passed down to my children after they graduate Goosebumps or whatever the equivalent is in another twenty or so years. And they will be terrified out of their wits and then we will read The House With a Clock in Its Walls under the covers and not be able to sleep the rest of the night. Sounds like bonding to me!
B00000DHRX|5|If you're looking for WHAM! forget it, although there is a WHAM BEST OF available seperately. This is all about George Michaels SOLO material, as my header states few can match him-vocally-lyrically he's in a class of his own and this CD will demonstrate that,leaving you in no doubt of the mans ability. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of music at all you will find it hard to dislike this CD. Great ballads,sung with oodles of clarity and class, Jesus To A Child must have had the Sony Exec's pulling their hair out in jealousy, superb. It covers all the bases from his early solo releases like Careless Whisper and A Different Corner to his late 90's stuff like Fastlove and Outside. All in all probably the best collection by one of, if not \\"THE\\" best singers ever to grace the charts.
B0099RFVXQ|4|Great movie!  Lots of action and good character development.  It is a classic.  Will be watched and re-watched many times.
B004GJDQT8|5|We use Amazon for pretty much everything. We love it.
B00B19DW0E|2|Sort of an interesting concept video.  But it was just so dated it was difficult to immerse.  Interesting to see Kurt Russell in that early role.  But, the acting from all corners just wasn't convincing.  I was kind of hoping for a Blade Runner type production which, my gosh, really holds up.  Prophetic in fact.  This, meh.
B00BATKZG4|5|This is a great book. It demystifies losing weight. it goes into nutrition, hunger, willpower, discipline, love for our self, and much more. Like the real reasons I should want to exercise.<br />I recommend this book for everyone.  It is excellent!
0345530578|1|This book was an interesting as watching paint dry. I as well question as to whether Grisham wrote this book...if he did, he should have tossed it in the trash heap instead of post-scripting the book with lame excuses as to why the book was so lame.
B00594XOZU|5|This is so awesome. Its fast and there are tons of other stuff like minigames (do numnum it is awesome) and even more sites on it to talk. Like dating site, gay and lesbian talk, and children fun. I reaaaaallllllllyyyyy recommend it if you have no games and want to talk to other peeps. BTW my user guygrt17 Kik me.
B004X2M9VY|5|I do wish Dr. Who wasn't SO into nightmare episodes; I am not a horror fan,and every other episode -- by design, as I understand it -- is meant to horrify.. And the plots generally do not lend themselves to deep and precise analysis, as in &#34;Wait a minute, what about...? Episodes are to be FELT, for the most part, not analyzed. All that said, I loved the way Matt Smith played the role, and the releationship between him and his companion (then companions), Amelia Pond and Rory, was humorous, complex, and touching. I still can't figure out why Smith bailed out. Was he pushed?
B007JRUCGO|5|Absolutely adorable for the whole family. It has family values and great music. Even my cranky husband loved it. Positive family values are now negative? Come on folks. Worth the two bucks we paid to rent it. You will not be sorry!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Works just as described. I can even stream any video playing from my PC or mobile web browser with no lag whatsoever.
B007SGM084|5|Amazing book to dream of with this lovely story that will take you to imagine and dream of something else...
B00526ZKYS|5|Interesting story line, dystopian society coming of age book. Lena is a strong character in a world of adversity. Looking forward to want will happen in Pandemonium.
0812993012|4|Ed tells a good story.  Interested to see the transformation of a computer scientist specializing in computer graphics to an executive and what he sees from his bird's-eyes view.<br /><br />For some reasons, it doesn't read like a business book to me but more like an autobiography.  Recommended!
0785163174|4|This was great.  Heard about.. got it.. read it.. blew my mind.  TENSION was on point. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B0010SKTRA|5|Very educational book written so anyone (including me) can understand.  This scientific text is written with humor and seems to flow from chapter to chapter easily.  Anyone interested in genetics and the science of evolution should find this book as fascinating as I did.
B000002P2V|5|If you really listen to this CD/Album (in the old days), there are some hidden gems! I still remember the news about Keith Moon and wondering what are the Who going to do? They have a great new album out and no  drummer.    New Song, Guitar & Pen, Trick of the Light and Music Must Change are all  great, along with the John Entwistle's songs!    Pick it up you won't be disappointed!!!
B00CWY76CC|5|the game was easy but I loved it anyway! This game will go places if the developer adds more levels that are more challenging.
B00J3AW23G|5|these games were always fun<br />great freee app of the day<br /><br />addicting as well
B00BSBR9N6|3|the premise is unusual- a love story told from the perspective of an autistic person. In the end it is not satisfying because of the inability of the protagonist to feel and to make us feel. and without an emotional guide, Rosie is rather unpleasant.
B00CW665VI|5|Plot: 5<br />Characters: 4<br />Steam Factor: 5<br />Would I buy in print: YES<br /><br />Tangled is not just a Disney movie folks! Holy pink elephants...this book was smokin'!  Tangled is a new take on romance. Completely told through the male point of view. I just absolutely adored it. Emma Chase has to be a guy. I mean it is THAT good!<br /><br />Drew Evans is a cross between Gideon Cross from BTY and Travis Maddox from BD (without the fighting). An investments executive who has more women than the yellow pages goes from having his choice of females and a place in the sun at work to battling for one heartstoppingly career minded for his very sanity. This hated horn dog gets mentally neutered. One look and the player is out of the game.<br /><br />Kate Brooks is just a perfect foil for Drew. Gorgeous, driven, and engaged to another man she is the fox that dog wants to hunt. Yet she isn't going down without a fight! I don't know she resisted as long as she did. Drew is a bad boy personified. Rich, dark, and utterly confident in his powers of seduction the man is testosterone in a tie. Kate though had him by the.....nose.<br /><br />Now let it be said that I sincerely hope that Dee-Dee gets her own book. As a supporting character just brace yourself. Her attitude is out there and in your face. She had NO filter and I loved it!<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is that you just don't read that many books from the here's point of view. Thus as I was reading maniacal laughter burst forth numerous times. Even my hubby came down the hall to find out what was so funny! The many quotes in this book are just genius! Emma Chase tells it like it is from the male mind! It was crass, crude, and utterly creative! I could not have enjoyed it more. I hope it comes out on audio cause truly I would order it in a heartbeat to drive by. I can just see my fellow travelers now staring at me as I guffaw down the highway at 70 mph.<br /><br />Invest in this little gem and I guarantee you will not be sorry!rantee you will not be sorry!
B00992CF6W|5|I think it is so awesome. I love minecraft!!! I don't know why some people didn't get the update because I did. Overall it is AWESOME!!!!!!! :)
B00992CF6W|5|so this is how the world goes on with minecraft<br />I really like to hit stuff .I'm in heaven with this game so so awesome.
0920236251|3|Positive story for young girls however the book is the height/width of 6 postage stamps? I should have paid better attention to a previous review and I definitely will next time!
B00G2DC2EG|4|Buy this, by all means, but hopefully it will make you own, if you don't already, the first two Butterfield albums, and the Flag albums &#34;Long Time Comin'&#34;, and &#34;The Trip&#34; soundtrack.  Too many killer tracks not on this compilation that are essential to a full appreciation of Mr Bloomfield.
B00B0LPYXG|2|Not to my taste.  Denzel made me sit through as long as I did, otherwise would have walked off after 15 minutes
B0085776BG|5|Exceptional story, very well written and presented.  The special effects were exceptional.  Definitely worth viewing.  The storyline was easy to follow and this was highlighted by the interaction of the characters.
B0013FSL3E|5|Love this movie!! Soooo cute!!
B0071PS7AC|5|I have to give kudos to this developer for not including any useless permissions! Some games ask for your contact lists and everything else! The game itself is just so-so, but if we give bad devs 1 star for excessive permissions I like to reward devs that don't use any.
B0054JZC6E|4|I like this its kinds of annoying with the pop up things but other than that I don't have an issue with it.
B0020BUWX2|5|I loved it, so we'll written you felt like it was happening to you
B0010SKUYM|5|The book starts slow but once rolling prepared to be sucked in.A good book that kept getting better and forced you to wait like a child on the floor beside a great story teller.
B005K17RU0|5|Accurate forecasts! Great setup! Very is to use! Real time Radar! Love the &quot;feels like&quot; temperature that factors in wind chill and humidity! GREAT APP
B00JB3MVCW|1|Included in Amazon Prime. Happy I didn't pay extra for it. I wouldn't know where to start. Crowe didn't have to act because it was just so dismal to begin with. Best part of the film were the EFX. That's about it.
B007J4T2G8|5|This book is SO wonderful. Al three of them are wonderful. I did not want the book to end. The next two are also wonderful. I could not put them down. They consumed me. I give this a 5 star for sure !
B0098VYCCE|2|Did not like the movie.  Glad I watched it at home so I didn't waste additional time traveling to the theater!
B0011UJMK2|4|First time reading a Tom Rob Smith book.<br /><br />Great story. Faced paced. Nice twist. Great read. Look forward to reading more from Tom Rob Smith.
B00001OH7U|5|In which D. Bowie gets good.<br />I have always been of two minds about Bowie; on the one hand, his undeniable intelligence, taste, and ability to spot cultural trends barely perceptible to all but those buried in deep the underground has allowed him to be one of the biggest influences in pop music history; on the other hand, his relationship to rock 'n roll has always been that of a dilletante outsider, a cabaret artiste/actor playing dress-up and often delivering a lot of bad music in the process, i.e., he means to come on like his idols/collaborators Iggy, the Velvets, Eno but winds up sounding like Anthony Newley after a bad encounter with THC.<br />However, between '75 and '80, he made a string of records of undeniable worth, which cast a massive shadow over many subsequent developments; I'm talking about this album, \\"Low,\\" \\"Heroes,\\" \\"Lodger,\\" \\"Scary Monsters,\\" and his collaborations with Mr. Pop, \\"The Idiot\\" and \\"Lust for Life.\\" \\"Station to Station\\" is the starting point, the template, and in many ways the best of the bunch.<br />Bowie had just shed his glitter-era Ziggy personae, his wife, and his management company, and acquired such a massive cocaine habit that by his own admission, his psyche disintegrated. Living in LA, a town he despised, and shooting The Man Who Fell to Earth, wherein his fragile mental and physical state is evident for all to see, he recorded this album as the soundtrack, though it was never used. The music is a strange brew of discordant elements -- the soul/disco/funk of \\"Young Americans,\\" lots of guitar noise courtesay of 6-string mangler Earl Slick, discrete electronics, cabaret balladry, and intimations of a new robotic futurism. Both sides of the LP symetterically followed the same pattern -- a dark, epic, guitar-driven funk opus (the title track and \\"Stay\\"), a prayerful soul-tinged ballad with lots of W's in the title(\\"Word on a Wing,\\" \\"Wild is the Wind\\"), and a danc-y futuristic novelty song (\\"Golden Years,\\" \\"TVC15\\"). Songrwriting-wise, this is Bowie's most consistent disc, every tune actually hits the bulls-eye, his baritonal croon sounds unforced, and real emotion and wit shine through the \\"plastic soul\\" (his words) musical pallette. Special mention must be made of my favorite song on the album, \\"TVC15,\\" a nonsense song Bowie said was about a TV that ate his girlfriend, and the wittiest, most infectious thing he ever wrote, fusing a true danceable groove, a Devo-esque chorus, guitar noise, and a New Orleans-based barrelhouse piano melody.<br />Bowie said this album chronicled his crack-up, which perhaps is the reason it registers emotionally. The music looks forward to the chance-driven, grim electronic soundscapes of his subsequent Berlin Trilogy without sacrificing rock 'n roll accessibility. \\"Station to Station's\\" fusion of black dance music,deep depression, and metal machine music would wind up dictating much of UK post punk, both good (Joy Division, Magazine, The Cure) and bad (Bauhaus, Spandau Ballet, The Human League), and beyond that point the way to much industrial and electronica. In 1976, when it came it out, no-one would have guessed this, and the record seemed like an anomaly in DB's discography and unlike anything else on the radio at the time. Sometimes a dilettante sees things the rest of us cannot.
B00GH4RKYM|5|Awesome movie. I enjoyed how Snyder followed the tone of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Cavill plays the perfect superman - he seems grounded and doesn't over dramatize the character. Looking forward to Batman vs Superman now!
0316204366|3|As a 30 year education veteran (Teacher, Principal and Superintendent); I thought the sections on\\" Class Size\\" and \\"Effective Parenting and Resources\\" were weak, and not up to Gladwell standards. \\"Class Size\\" is a variable that is very dependent on many other variables like: Teacher efficacy, teacher experience, teacher expertise (mastery of methodology and content), teacher resources, etc.  For example:  A large class with a great teacher trumps a class half the size with an incompetent teacher. On the second topic there are deep and wide deleterious effects of poverty that can influence a parent's ability to be effective and the child's ability to learn; these can't just be overlooked. However, chapter 3 of Malcolm Gladwell's: David and Goliath Should be read by every college bound high school student and H.S. Guidance Counselor and College Advisor. For more read:  [...]
B008220BP2|5|Loved the movie so much that I had to buy it. It's a cheesy romantic comedy with a little bit of zombie action thrown in!
B00AREIAI8|5|I wanted this game when I had my android and it wasn't compatible with the device so I was pretty sad but I got the kindle fire for Christmas and found this game and I love it!!
B0098VYCCE|4|Good twist on an old story. Lots of action. Could think of better actress for K. Stewart role, but rest of cast very good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great read. I enjoyed thoroughly. This was a wonderful follow up to a&#34;A Time to Kill&#34; with lots of twists and turns along the way.
B0042JSMV4|5|I DL a Kindle version to my IPAD and I just LOVE it! The pictures are nice and clear, the colors are bright, and the text is beautiful. Yes, I love the book editions too, but I wanted this immediately, so I figured: \\"What the heck, I'll give it a try.\\" I'm NOT disappointed at all. It is a beautiful version and I 5 star recommend it to everyone who questions whether they should try it or not.
1476729085|5|The best book I've read all year. Funny and sweet and insightful. I am telling all of my friends about this one, since I think everyone should read it. It was a nice little happy surprise.
B0001CCXZW|5|Shipped immediately, but I didn't realize the store was in Canada, so it took a bit longer than expected. Got it in time for Christmas in perfect condition.
B001RTP3YQ|5|This is a most unique retake on some of his old starndards, which I did not think could be improved upon.  A real treasure.  Thank goodness for CD's because I will never be able to attend one of his concerts.
B00TQE9SIQ|5|excellent performances by all; Juan Diego Flores is as close to perfect as you will ever see.  Orchestra is especially fine; loved the english horn solos.
B003YVLC18|4|Great chick flick.  Watched with wife, both enjoyed it.  Teen should too, not so good for children.
B00CHOPEKI|1|First, the doll was look different . be sure to look at the box two photos at the top of the page .  damaged also barbie  Red shopping bag was worn out!<br />How could be ? It wasn't new barbie looks second . Anyway The damaged box ruins the doll's value further down the line . I don.t like it
0545123291|5|My 13-year-old bibliophile loved this book enough to pay her own money for it.  She is very happy with the purchase.
B00280LYIC|4|Fast read, interesting plot.  Has one looking forward to the next book.
B00JL6L4WC|4|Still a fan of the original, but not bad for a remake. Great visual effects.
B000VX383C|5|I have worn this style and manufacturer for years, and have sometimes had trouble finding it.  You had it, in my size and at a very competitive price.
1439138311|4|This is my first exposure to this particular author and I will be seeking out his other books based upon what I read here.<br /><br />Eilis Lacey was born in a small Irish town and is suffering through the lack of job and life opportunties of the depressed Irish economy following WWII. Her family and a Catholic priest make arrangements for her to pursue opportunties in the United States (Brooklyn) by acquiring a job and going back to school to further her education. We follow her life from the time she was in Ireland, through the crossing to the United States, and then observe how she settles into her new home. We share her fears and frustrations as she experiences in this totally foreign world. The call to return to Ireland is strong and as the novel unfolds, the reader finds out if the pull back is strong enough to override her developing comfort with life in Brooklyn.<br /><br />I used the word \\"subtle\\" to describe this novel because it fits it perfectly. The beginning of the book moves slowly and not much appears to be happening when I eventually realized I was totally drawn into the story and mesmerized. The writing is relatively simple and straightforward but manages to convey to the reader absolutely everything the reader needs to know - therefore, subtle. In a novel of this sort, it would be easy to over-write and to become verbose and flowery -- that doesn't happen. My only real complaint is with the character of \\"Tony\\" whom she meets in Brooklyn at a dance and he becomes a main character as the book moves along. He didn't ring true for me and seemed just too perfect. Not three-dimensional to me.<br /><br />The book reminds me a lot of \\"Empire Falls\\" by Richard Russo in the keen observation skills and sharp analysis of the place and time. Since \\"Empire Falls\\" is one of my all-time favorite novels, that is a strong endoresment.
B00CO5AQ12|5|Well, first of all, Normal sand you can clump together into a ball, roll it around in you hands and make a little sand snowman out of it, sit back and admire your lack of artistic skills... well, Not this stuff.<br /><br />You can clump it together into a ball for about six seconds, and then it starts to escape, crumbling at ever increasing speeds till your ball is a mass of instant erosion.<br /><br />If you roll it around in your hands, it begins dribbling out the gaps, as if waiting for the first chance it gets.<br /><br />If you make a little sandman, it quickly crumbles, as if pointing out the futility of your attempts at order, gleefully demonstrating entropy.<br /><br />If you tightly pack it into a low center of gravity mass and stare at it... well, it just lies there and does nothing.<br /><br />But if you attempt to add height to that mass, it mocks your attempts.<br /><br />This is sand that does not behave well.<br /><br />It's very naughty sand.
B00DONM9AE|3|This product was mediocre for many reasons. First of all, for 12$ this is a very small plush, it fit in the palm of my hand, but I anticipated the larger version. Secondly, paws of Vaporeon were lopsided and a bit uneven. Lastly, the yellow frills on Vaporeon's ears are made of a cheap see-through material.<br /><br />Although Vaporeon has many cons, there are many pros. For example, it is VERY stiff and can sit up well on most surfaces. It is also very accurate to the anime. Embroidery work and feet pads are done well. The face is not lopsided in any way, and it is well constructed and thickly stiched so it can not be pulled apart easily.<br /><br />Overall, I give this plush 3 out of five stars for minor problems.<br /><br />Here is my full review:<br />Accuracy: 5 out of 5 stars<br />Construction: 4 out of 5 stars<br />Colors: 5 out of 5<br />Size: 2 out of 5<br />Materials: 3 out of 5<br />Tag: 5 out of 5
B00003CXCT|1|This edition does not include the original versions of the movies as they appeared in theaters...not even as a special edition. Only the heavily altered versions are available.
B00B4804KS|5|I put this in and started watching the movie and if you like bass you will have it. 3-d effect is pretty good and the sound effects are amazing.
0553386794|5|By far, this is the one of the best fantasy works I've read in recent years. If you like the show, you will LOVE the books even more. It adds more depth to the characters and there is so much more I understand than just what they show on HBO.<br /><br />I love how GRRM's mind works...you have to be a genius to imagine and write all this. I finished this book in 4 days (If I didn't have work, I would have stayed up all day and night and never put it down!). The characters are amazing and the plot is full of twists and turns...yes, it is long like the Lord of Rings but is just as amazing to read! I can't recommend this book and the series enough.
B007IXWL2C|5|Great twists and turns! Haven't read a book series so fast!
B005GFPZYK|5|Very revealing story of honor and courage.
0977326403|4|Interesting, concise look at how businesses and groups can improve our performance as well as our team and workforce goals and achievements.
1433535734|5|This is an enormous study bible.  The print was not quite large enough so I passed this to my youngest daughter and bought a truly large type.  Hurts admitting to be older.  Comes with an online ESV study bible (which I use religiously) which gives you all the references.
B003PTP4S6|5|This music is amazing.  I play it over and over while I am doing my art.<br />It moves me in beautiful ways as I create my art.  It is very soothing and<br />relaxing.  I want more of it for my music library.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Wonderful!
B00HETD0KC|3|Advertised as extended editions but when they arrived only the first 2 were extended editions.  Would not have spent the extra money for this set if I had known that only the first 2 were extended editions. I thought there would be more scenes that there cut out of the orginials.

0345803485|3|Yes this book is top seller right now. But most of this book is just like the Twilight books except without vampires and with a sex addict instead. Ana is an exact mirror image of Bella. And Christian Grey is the over protective boyfriend and they have this \\"connection\\". Yes people may like the book but if you didn't like twilight this book is not for you. Plus it contains graphic details on their \\"relationship in bed\\".
B00B89WXYS|5|Gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas - won me major props with his family and mom. 10/10 would buy again, and buy two this time.
0545128285|5|Awesome reading I love Harry potter. What an honor it is that the creators of happy potter actually gave the fans an actual book used in the movie, such a great read. My favorite story in here of course is the Tale of the Three Brothers.
B000NQRE9Q|4|Bought as a gift. Haven't given to recipient yet, but they will enjoy watching the series on their big screen TV
B00IWULQQ2|5|A must see for all ages - very well done.

B008KMHFJY|3|Can't really see what all the hype is about this book, quite disappointing. Certainly not a book I couldn't put down.
B000002UB3|5|'Abbey road' is my second favorite Beatles album, (behind only the masterpiece 'Sgt Pepper's lonley hearts club band').<BR>The entire album is wonderful, starting off with the one-two punch of &quot;Come together&quot; and &quot;Something&quot;, both of which were number one hits, and following up with corny but somewhat cool &quot;Maxwell's siver hammer&quot; and then the awsome &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;.<BR>&quot;Octopus's garden&quot; is one of Ringo Starr's shining moments on all of the Beatles albums, having composed this track all by his-self. Side-A ends with &quot;I want you (She's so heavy)&quot; which has a kinda jazzy feel to it.<BR>Side-B begins with George Harrison's &quot;Here comes the sun&quot; which is probably the album's stand-out track, and is followed by &quot;Because&quot; which has John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Harrison doing what they do best, three-part harmony.<BR>&quot;Sun king&quot; has a very late 60's feel to it, and it's wonderful, the organ in the song adds a great touch to it.<BR>The medley more or less begins with &quot;She came in through the bathroom window&quot; and flows until &quot;The end&quot;, a song which, features all four Beatles taking turns at solos, begining with Starr's only recorded drum solo as a Beatle, then McCartney, Harrison and Lennon taking turns at guitar solos, in that order.<BR>All in all, this is a fitting fairwell to the fab four, and is a must have for any Beatles fan, or any fan of classic rock music.<BR>George Harrison's compositions stand out as the best work on this album. &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here comes the sun&quot; are commonly referred to by critics and fans alike as this albums best songs, and I agree.
0307949508|5|I really liked The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and took a break after I finished it. When I picked up The Girl Who Played With Fire, I could not put it down. The action never stops, you learn so much more about the main characters and are rooting for them throughout the 630 pages. I stayed up late and set my alarm for earlier than usual to read some more in the mornings. Highly recommended.
B00003CXCS|5|Watching the Sound of Music is such pure joy, if only for the breathtaking scenes and wonderful musical score. I'm pretty sure it had sparked an interest in music in many children in my generation. I remember being  filled with awe watching the movie the first time and I never tire watching  it to this day. The wedding scene was just so &quot;beautiful&quot;, made  more memorable by Maria's Wedding March sung by the nuns (sigh!) It's a  pity they don't make wholesome movies like this anymore. This is the  perfect movie for every family for all time.
B005544TRQ|5|Great series...intelligent and entertaining. I had to restrain myself from binge watching. I am definitely looking forward to season two and three
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is one of the best games my kids have me playing. I love it and I highly recommend this game. I give it two thumbs up.
B008Y7N7JW|5|I very much enjoyed the movie.  As an archer and archery instructor, it pleases me that young adults are portrayed in the sport.  This encourages others (especially females) and sends the message that everyone can enjoy learning to shoot.<br /><br />Rich Rochford<br />Tampa, FL

B00008972S|5|My daughter asked for this for a Christmas present. It originally said I would get it in January but to my surprise I got it 3 days before Christmas. So my daughter was able to find it under the tree and was very excited about it!
B004X75RK4|5|I simply like Sandra Bullock.<br />It is kind of a silly story but then i really like silly.<br />This is a great movie for the Valentine season.
B00DURGZHW|1|This was beneath the talent of Matthew McConaughey.  It was slow and frankly boring.  I would not recommend you wasting your time.
B000654OUG|5|Uchida never fails to excite with her breath-taking excellence. The sonatas are played<br />with deep understanding and musicality, fully supported  by her faultless technique.
B00CSR2J9I|4|Was fun to play
B000002UAU|5|Simply THE seminal work in the history of rock and roll.  This album (recognizing Brian and \\"Pet Sounds\\" as an influence) changed the face of rock and roll forever.  It gave rock the complexity and depth to sustain it over the last 50 years and I predict well into the next Century.
B00005BJ2O|5|Simply put- Best soundtrack of the Year!  All the songs are excellent, even that one, ya know, the one they play all the time! Though the producers forgoe some excellent songs from the movie (Like a Virgin, The Show must go on) it's still very good. Personal favorites...Well all of them, especially Your Song and Elephant Love Meledy. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are extrordinary singers for actors, especially the latter. In Your song, he really shows his talent. Beck, U2's Bono and David Bowie are nice additions to complete this PERFECT soundtrack. Hasn't left my CD player for 3 weeks!
B00AFROVQC|5|Well written and enjoyable. I can't get enough of the story.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Once you get started it's hard to stop playing!!

B006PHD0RW|5|I really enjoy this game. I used to bag groceries for a living so it is kind of fun to see it I can get them all to fit in the bag or smashing them is fun too.  Do I have 20 words yet? Or should I just keep rambling on about this game? Ya know it's really stupid that I need 20 words I just wanted to say that this game was fun.
B00SXK8R6S|5|Absolutely the best.... I wish there were enough for me to binge watch!!
B00005JGAB|5|I don't need to type anything, the music speaks for it's self!!!
B00J2VSS0C|4|Fun game to play
B00EI4V3X2|4|FOR ACCURATE SOUND YOU NEED TO TUNE THIS HEADSET TO THE PROPER SETTING DEPENDING ON THE GAME. IF YOU FAIL TO DO THIS, YOU WILL GET BAD RESULTS AND THE SURROUND SOUND WILL SUCK. THIS IS PROBABLY WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE GIVING THIS HEADSET BAD REVIEWS, BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO TUNE IT, LOL. Now an honest review...<br /><br />This is a great headset, hands down. It is truly a 100$ headset both in value and quality (not worth over $100 US in my opinion), but it does have some things I don't like. I give it a 78/100 overall. The Set-up is easy but instructions do not come with the box (not when I bought it 8 months ago anyway), so you have to go online and search \\"Px4 headset set up\\" in google or yahoo to figure out how to do it. The info is easy to find online so no big deal.<br /><br />Here are the PROS and CONS.<br /><br />1) SURROUND SOUND- 4.2/ 5<br /><br />If you play CALL OF DUTY or another FPS game, this will be a great headset for you and you will definitely hear foot steps almost PERFECTLY (85-100% accuracy, depending on the map) with this baby, BUT ONLY IF YOU TUNE IT TO THE RIGHT SETTING. For COD, you need to use the 5th surround sound angle on the WiFi box/ Dynamic Chat Boost (click surround sound angle on the box until the blue light flashes to the 5 count), the 3rd setting on the TONE (click the button until you hear three beeps) and the 4th setting on the LIMITER (click the button until you hear 4 beeps) - tone and limiter are buttons found on the headset. One of the great things about surround sound in this headset is that you can customize it to your liking depending on how you ears hear sound. Most human beings hear quite similarly though, hence my recommendation for hearing footsteps in game above.<br /><br />On COD: Ghosts, footsteps are very loud and easy to spot, with 100% accuracy on all maps, that's right, all maps, except those that have more than 2 stories (Chasm and Flooded), where you will have problems targeting exactly on which floor upstairs or downstairs the footsteps are coming from; and if there are a lot of people running upstairs on the 1st and second story, for example, you will have to REALLY concentrate figuring out which footstep is closer to you because it sounds as if footsteps are everywhere upstairs; I had this problem mostly on Chasm. You will still know which angle and side the footsteps are coming from, but it will be difficult pinpointing which footstep is closer to you. On every other map, the headset works really well, though, because there aren't a lot of stories. For sound whoring, this headset is 9/10 overall, which is amazing for a 100$ headset.<br /><br />The surround sound is good for other games too, like racing, adventure, etc, but not great, all you have to do is adjust the TONE and LIMITER to 2 beeps for bass or 1 beep for raw sound. Good but a bit artificial. I think the surround sound is best for FPS games, to be honest, and it isn't that great with movies, which isn't surprising since you shouldn't really except a \\"one in all\\" headset to be great in everything.<br /><br />2) COMFORT: 3.5/5<br /><br />When I first bought the headset, it felt nice on my ears (I have large ears) for the first few hours, but after 6 hours of gameplay, my ears started to hurt a little and I began to notice the weight of the headset pressing on my ears a lot more than before. After 8 months of playing though, my ears got used to the headset so they don't hurt anymore no matter how long I play; but if your ears have to get used to bearing the weight of something, that generally means the weight is a little too much on the ears, doesn't it? It's fine for playing really long sessions, but you will want to take them off your head once every few hours to give your ears a break. Comfort isn't the best on this headset; this ain't no Astro in comfort, but it's still good for comfort, probably unnoticeable unless you've owned Astro's before.<br /><br />3) WIRELESS: 3/5<br /><br />This headset is wireless and you don't need to plug in anything while playing unless you want to chat. To make it the most wireless, go to Sound and Screen> Audio Output Settings in ps4 and make sure the output to headphones setting is on Chat Audio or All Audio (forgot which one, whichever one works after you complete the next step). Then mute your TV and turn up your headset; voila, wireless sound.The only cable you will have to plug in while playing is the short microphone cable to the ps4 controller, if you want to chat online, that's it, and also the charger if you have to charge the headset. You can also charge the headset while playing since the charging cable is very long. You can lower and raise the volume on the headset too. All of the other buttons, however, like calling and receiving calls and the mute and Bluetooth buttons are useless and don't work on the headset because ps4 still hasn't released Bluetooth compatibility. Once the patch is made, this headset for wireless will be 5/5. For now it is a 3/5.<br /><br />4) BATTERY LIFE: 5/5<br /><br />The battery life is one of the best I have ever seen. Once it's low on battery the headset will start beeping every 30 seconds letting you know you need to charge it. And you can charge while playing. 15 hours battery life is no lie.<br /><br />5) MICROPHONE SOUND: 4.5/5<br /><br />The microphone is great and ALMOST sounds as if the person is talking right next to you. It's adjustable and removable. You can also hear yourself in the background if you want to know how loud you are. The only problem is the microphone does pick up a little background sound only if someone is talking loudly in the room you play in. There is no background static or  breathing if you breathe loudly though so none of this is a problem.  (CAUTION: The MIC WILL PICK UP slight BREATHING IF THE MIC is too close to your mouth and the mic volume IS SET TO MAXIMUM; the volume of the mic should be on 50% for maximum efficiency: go to devices> audio devices> microphone devices> then lower the mic volume to half since you don't need max anyway). And you won't wake anyone up while talking at night too since you can whisper and the mic will still pick up your voice quite nicely. This mic is the best if you are alone playing the game. If you have a lot of people in your room talking a lot around you while you chat online, then don't get this headset unless you turn the mic off since people on the other end will hear your voice mostly, yes, but also other voices echoing ever so slightly in the background. This ain't no Astro when it comes to cancelling background noise.<br /><br />6) BUILD: 4 /5<br /><br />Not cheaply made at all. The WiFi Box is hollow but that doesn't matter. Nice and stable, still mint condition after 8 months of use.<br /><br />So there you have it. A great headset worth every penny, but not without its annoying little problems. The only headset you will ever need for Ps4, unless you want to have the best and upgrade to Astro. I haven't tested the new Ps4 Gold Wireless Headset but I've heard that one is good too. I don't know if the Gold is better than the Px4 though, so you'll have to test that yourself. Gold Wireless vs. PX4 would be a great review, wouldn't it? Anyway, good luck shopping!nd you don't need to plug in anything while playing unless you want to chat.

B004INNRFK|5|I was highly entertained with David Foster's previous \\"Hitman\\" production. In \\"Hitman Returns,\\" he provides us with another opportunity to marvel at his genius. With a wide variety of musicians and songs (although not all of the songs performed are Foster's), I am more impressed with this program than the last. My only complaint is that the CD only includes a minimal amount of music performed on the DVD.

0767831837|5|Thinking about the idea of a sad movie when i get into the cinema and about the bad idea of going to watch it, I didnt want it to finish when I left. It was a great movie, I think that the little kid, Ben, should have  won an award for best supporting actor. His character in the movie turnes  all the sad moments into funny ones. Its the kind of person everyone needs  in theirs lifes to be similing all the time. To put a smiling face in bad  moments. To know how to front bad moments. I think the movie has a little  bit of all, and the actings of Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, are so  believable. Its great that we hae movies like this one.

B005VPRETE|3|The set itself is cute, and it has some fun details, but the minifig doesn't move the same way that regular Lego people do--specifically, the hands cannot rotate nor can the legs separate. What's more, the only piece of the figure that is interchangeable with regular Lego minifigs is the hair, which was disappointing as my daughter and I were really looking forward to seeing how Olivia would look in a spacesuit or with a pirate hook instead of a left hand.<br /><br />The blocks themselves can be combined with other Lego sets, so that is a plus. However, creatively mixing and matching the minifig pieces to create new characters is one of the fun things about traditional Lego, and this element is conspicuously lacking in the \\"Friends\\" line. Swapping clothes and hairstyles between the \\"Friends\\" just isn't the same.

B003XF1XOQ|5|Great book I've read it several times and probably will read it a few more because it's that good of a book
B008JFUS8M|5|Of course I jumped on the bandwagon when the first movie came out, and quickly read all the books then watched the first movie. The second movie was just as good, and does a pretty darn good job of following the book (which really impressed me as the imagery I had in my head after reading the second book, i did not think they would be able to do it justice, but I was wrong)<br />I do recommend reading the books first, as this movie has to be confusing to someone that has not read the books, but this movie was a great addition to reading the book.

B001O1O71C|5|My son who hates to read absolutely loved this!
B002BSHWUU|5|I've been reading a lot of the reviews submitted for both the stereo and the mono sets; which is better, etc.  I truly appreciate a lot of the information and specific songs, parts, variances that many of the more expert listeners have submitted.  I'm just a life long hack who loves this music still and have been content to listen to them via LP, cassette, 8 track, 1980s cds and the new superduper, no phony baloney remastered sets.    I bought the stereo set and a friend has given me mono tracks for Sgt. Pepper and an assortment of songs that some of the previous reviewers have given as examples. (Thank you for that!)    I also have the Capitol Releases that feature those cds remastered in stereo and mono. So, I think I'm set.    Again, I'm no expert but as a life long fan listen for certain parts that sound clearer (If I Needed Someone) in stereo or sound fuller in mono (I've Just Seen A Face). I'm still tyring to figure out which sound does Sgt. Pepper greater justice.    I find it funny that the mono vs stereo debate has accelerated since the sets were released.    My generation ( 12 years old in 1964) thought that stereo was the ultimate way to listen to any music. We couldn't wait to get everything in stereo!    Then cds started to crop up in the 80s and I noticed a certain emptiness in \\"the middle\\". You know, clear vocals and instrumentation but something sounded hollow within the songs. I mean, I could hear vocals, instrumentation and certain nuances in guitar solos ( I never knew Paul did the bass part vocally in \\"I Will\\" until I downloaded the song from my 80s cd and put it on my Ipod).     Still, some things have not improved with all of the technology we've gone through. The drum break in \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" never has had the kind of loudness and pop that I've heard when I've seen it done live by tribute bands like the Fab Faux or 1964-The Tribute. That \\"pop\\" I'm listening for has never been there. So, maybe that's the way the boys recorded it.Too, bad, it sounds better with the louder drum break.    Whatever your preference, both sets improve upon what was previously available. The importance to a true Beatles fan is that they're both available to us even if some of us can't break down the sound quality as expertly as others out there. I thank those that can and have used their advice and comments to learn something new about this beautiful music that I've been listening to for over forty years. I still have my original LPs. I ruined them by picking up the needle and placing it songs that I preferred to hear out of order. I tried to be careful, but, when one is young, distracted or not fully conscious, the hand slips. I'd like to think that my generation paved the way for needle play for the legion of hip/hop, rap, house djs that followed us. Take that, youngsters!    God rest my father's soul. He was Cuban, didn't speak English well, didn't understand the British Invasion and said it would never last like Sinatra. Still, I'd catch him humming \\"Yesterday\\", \\"And I Love Her\\" or \\"Something\\" around the house.    Hey Pop, guess what? My music held up, too. Strawberry Fields Forever.

B00BAXFECK|5|Why do we love? Why do we persist? A page turner of a story to explain the beloved irrational that makes our mortality beautiful and our choices seem right if not rational. Many unforgettable characters :some only appearing briefly but swiftly defined with a few brushstrokes and others so lovingly introduced that they are like uncles or grandmothers you might wish were yours<br /><br />Cannot wait to reread but must catch up on sleep
B005ZOBNOI|5|John Green takes on an emotional and esoteric wealth of subject matter in this Young Adult Fiction novel, but he does so in this unpretentious, relatable, and downright likeable manner that makes the novel a true page turner.<br /><br />I had not read YAF since I was a young adult and in the beginning of the novel I felt annoyed that such a gem of a book had to be locked inside a YAF novel, peppered with simple sentences and written in such a way that I almost felt like I was watching a movie (easy entertainment). That’s a compliment in itself to many, but I generally go for books with vivid imagery and prose. By the end of the book though, I was in tears at the stunning themes he was able to weave through and explore simultaneously; at the humor; the insight; and the beauty. And ultimately I was thankful and a bit awestruck by his ability to craft a masterpiece that would both appeal to a move both young adults and adults.<br /><br />This is an absolute 5-star book and it will be one I must re-read in years to come, just to remember.
B007I1Q4W2|5|Exit Humanity is much more than a shoot-em-up zombie film. It has been thoughtfully crafted with good performances, decent script and fine cinematography. In a similar fashion to The Walking Dead, this film focuses on how people treat people. It is presented as a series of chapters, furthering the story in logical blocks of time and story. The creators also used some short animated sequences - these helped to progress the story while setting the viewer up for the next instalment. This is an example of fine film-making on a limited budget.

I had no problem downloading the language files with WIFI off.<br /><br />There is a mandatory 130MB image file that must be downloaded to use this app.  The language files are 20-30MB each for most languages. The biggest language file, I believe, was 48MB (Spanish - Spain.)<br /><br />Sometimes the speaker talks too quickly - I wish there was a way to adjust the speed.<br /><br />The phrases and words are grouped together fairly well and if you have multiple languages installed you can easily hear how the same word is said in another language with just a couple of \\"clicks.\\"<br /><br />The images are drawn well but don't make sense when combined with the HUGE file size because they aren't high resolution pics - I hope the dev optimizes the pics to bring the size down to the 20MB range.<br /><br />All in all, a good application (no exit button, argh) and I have not checked if it keeps running in the background.<br />Good but a few design choices and poor WIFI support keep this app from being great.
B008OTTRXU|5|Ok Lets get it out of the way, \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is awesome and well worth buying the album by itself; however, I think it isn't the best song on the album. I own Tug Of War and this album is even better. It is well produced, written, and CRJ's voice has transitioned into a new sound, but with the same familiar and wonderful Ennunciations. This album is so much more than I was hoping for and Well Worth Buying! I will review the songs in the order I like them because this is my review.<br />  The best song on the album in my opinion is \\"More Than A Memory.\\" It is melancholy set to an upbeat tempo and laced with gorgeous vocals. It is one of them songs you stay in the car and listen to the end before you kill the engine and get out. The next song on the album I love is \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You.\\" You feel for the broken-hearted singer, but at the same time time the techno beat takes you on the ride to getting better and moving on. The vocals are incredible and the song is well composed like most of the album. The next song to make you hum along and wiggle in your seat is \\"Hurt So Good,\\" the beat get awesome, the vocals are pretty and catchy, and it all comes together in a song you won't want to skip. I love that \\"Good Time\\" with Owl City is on the album!!! It is a great song and one of the best hits of this summer, and as well as \\"Call Me Maybe,\\" worth the album purchase price.<br />  I figured a paragraph break was about due :~p \\"This Kiss\\" is a wonderful tune with the potential to be stuck in your head for weeks, and even though I don't really like the message of messing around, the song is cute and better than half the stuff on the radio right now. \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is great... enough said. \\"Tiny Little Bows\\" is so wonderfully peppy, poppy, cute, and catchy. I love that they sampled \\"Cupid Pull Back Your Bow... (originally by Sam Cook)\\" \\"Curiosity\\" and \\"Turn Me Up\\" are both wonderfully produced, written, and composed. \\"Turn Me Up\\" is a great song to finish listening to the album on, it wraps it up and and makes you smile. \\"Curiosity\\" is a very plateau-ish song. The build-up to the chorus says \\"here it comes.. wait for it .... wait for it,\\" but then the chorus falls short. The song is very good, but could have been better.<br />  A beautiful song for the hopeless romantic at heart is \\"Guitar String/Wedding Ring.\\" CRJ's vocals are strong, confident and combined with the track's great back-beat will have you tapping your foot. \\"Your Heart Is A Muscle\\" is very pretty and I can't place the piano accompaniment, but it wonderful.<br />  OK here's the Bad news, \\"Beautiful,\\" CRJ's part in the song is pretty, but the song is filler. Considering J. Bieber is listed #1 on the executive producers, I'm not surprised he has a track on the album. Thank you for producing the album though Mr. Bieber.<br />  This is one of the best pop albums ever compiled in my opinion. I fully endorse it and hope it dominates the billboards or whatever they have now. Thanks for reading the ramblings of an old, married, pop-loving, 30 something guy from TX.<br />[[ASIN:B00961ZESW Kiss [+digital booklet]]]g to the album on, it wraps it up and and makes you smile. \\"Curiosity\\" is a very plateau-ish song.

B002EEP3NO|4|6 year old son loved it - X-mas gift. He hasn't seen the movie yet, but already know bits and pieces of the story. It will likely take us (me mostly) a better part of this month to build this thing. But the details are incredible and the spaces within very unique so far.
B008EQIK90|5|Rented this for &#34;date night&#34; (The night of the week my fiance and I sit around, eat garbage, and indulge in a rental) This movie was hilarious, I really did not expect it to be quite as funny as it was. I was cackling like a witch. Jonah Hill is golden as usual. Definitely a movie we will end up owning on bluray!
B009TGXLZM|5|Ms. Zelweger's performance equals those of hers in; Chicago, Bridget Jones..., Cold Mountain,....  Stellar work given by all.  From cast and crew to screenplay, costuming, sfx, directing photo/cinematography, set design, makeup, original story (certainly) and adaptation, etc.  Touched my every emotion.<br />Five stars worth of enjoyment for all ages.
B000YPUF9W|5|excellent
B0026RHR6K|5|I bought Battlestar for my husband's birthday.  He was very disappointed that it doesn't have closed captioning as he enjoys watching videos while exercising.
B000MYFILK|5|A classic that is always enjoyable to revisit
B005K17RU0|1|No video or audio.  Just a bunch of numbers and statistics.  If we can't get some pictures and video of the weather in various parts of the country, what good is it.  I can see statistics on the local tv.
B007PVHBHC|5|Despite it being 7 years since her last album, Patti Smith hasn't lost a beat. Top to bottom, \\"Banga\\" is a beautiful album. Considering Patti's writing career as well, the lyrics have depth and construct vivid stories. Combined with poignant instrumentation, you have great songs. Grab this album! It's one of my favorites this year and sounds even better on vinyl!
B00ID4I6LA|5|sick movie, recomended - asa butterfield's the man : a bit &#34;short&#34; but I think its pretty good overall gogo
B002XMGGK6|4|It was a thriller from the beginning to the end. I love how the ending is absolutely nothing that I could have imagined!
B0084AYLK8|4|A masterly character study based around a handful of main protagonists in a close knit village and near surroundings described vividly with a wonderful technique that keeps you  reading through.
B00004UEDQ|4|good movie, great Bullock.  i highly recommend this movie to the general population out there.  give this one a try.
B00CKOYVG8|3|I didn't realize when I downloaded it that you needed to be on facebook. :( But, i liked the game, just don't do facebook
B00DUGCLY4|5|Very fun to kill time with! It is very Creative and very addicting! Im going to play this alot when i get really bored!
B000WDS04I|5|This show is hilarious. Not only are you in constant suspense on who Ted will marry as he continues to look for &#34;the one&#34;! But you are always wondering what will happen in the lives off all the characters season to season.
B000UUF69A|1|I rented this movie to watch with my nephews, it's a great fun movie, but i rented it to view through google chrome cast via laptop to TV.  The amazon video player doesn't support the device - it was only 2 bucks, but it was a very disappointing & frustrating experience.
B006LSZECO|4|Great book - thrilling and hard to put down.<br />Not a literary masterpiece by any stretch<br />DONT read the critics reviews before hand - it gives away some of the surprises.<br /><br />And it only got 5 stars b/d of the ending.<br />no spoilers here - but the ending was maddening.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|I started playing this game simply as a means of getting more water for my Farmville 2 farm. I've found several ways to help out one farm from the other. A plus is that it passes time very quickly, which has been helpful since I've been spending too much time in hospital waiting areas lately.That is also a drawback since time can get away from you as you play this. The game plays very quickly on my Kindle and I love the unlimited water. Lots of fun.
B006LSZECO|5|Great writer.
B004W4N55C|4|Perfect for me
0618918248|5|One of the most popular books of recent times is also one of the most thought provoking.  Author Dawkins is a brilliant teacher whose ideas will probably only grow in influence with future generations.  Why not read it first before deciding?  What are you afraid of?
B0013D8LCW|5|Simple story of two guys, one of whom pretended to be straight but later was easily seduced by another guy. However, it brought him to happiness =) Wish I seduced him earlier =)
B00EZ50R04|5|The movie speaks for itself, there's nothing i can say to help it out.  If you haven't seen it and enjoy scary movies then how can you call yourself a fan of them if you haven't seen the Insidious series??
B00005JKJA|1|I tried to like this movie.  I really did.  But for the life of me, I can't see how it's received so much praise.  The story makes great efforts to throw in a twist at the end ... but the preparation leading up to it makes such little sense that you know it's coming so it's no surprise.  There is little or no music to add suspense/emotion/etc. to the plot, and there are about a billion common-sense questions that go unanswered.  This was one of the worst movies I've ever watched.
B00EY8BRGU|4|It is a good story, great special effects.  It was a very entertaining, fun, not too deep kind of movie.
B00DNDR29I|5|Love love love this cd!
B00000GAIW|5|THIS CD IS WHAT I PLAY ON MY WAY TO THE OFFICE EACH AND EVERY MORNING. NEED I SAY MORE?
B001BANK32|5|I have owned this book for years but after seeing the movie (and loving it) I didn't think I needed to. I heard there was another book - a continuance of the book. So I finally read it. It was amazing! Somethings were the same and alot was different but I loved both. Definitely a great book!!
B003XF1XOQ|5|It was an emotional roller coaster that brought me to the ending of this book. Amazingly emotional. Loved this series and I know you will too.
B00D8CSVLW|4|I really loved this book, even though the Grisham pattern is in full swing
B00IJJUIMY|4|Interesting good police work but is Harry on the way out???
044022165X|5|Rudy Baylor has nothing.  He delivered pizzas and waited tables to get through college and law school.  He passed the bar, and got his licence - and one interesting case in a throwaway class in his last year at law school. <br /> <br />Circumstances force him into ambulance chasing with a man who never passed the bar.  But Rudy's one case is legal dynamite.  His clients were the victims of a bad-faith case that is textbook.  He has the dirt, and has the witnesses that has the dirt.  He has a favorable judge.  He is even smart enough to know how to turn the defendent's high priced lawyers into unwitting shills for his case. <br /> <br />Maybe being a rookie with nothing to lose worked in his favor.  He had no money, no professional reputation, or anything else to lose.  The trial scenes are amazing.  The green kid, the rookie, absolutely humilates the defendants, as well as the best legal defense money can buy.  Trust me, they wre rueing the day that he was ever born.   <br /> <br />Yeah, Grisham rigged the facts, the evidence, and everything to favor the rookie... in short a case any trial lawyer would love, combined with the favorable judge.  It's still fun.  I have to say though, if Grisham could rig the trial in Baylor's favor, he could rig the outcome.  Maybe the point is that his client got the justice she deserved, I have to feel her lawyer should have walked away from it all with the money.  Still, he got the girl - and maybe that was enough.  Along with the knowledge he quit being on top.
B00J2VSS0C|3|It's an Ispy game. Dont understand what all the stuff does or means. I just click on tasks and find the things in pictures. Just a mindless task to do while watching shows.
B006O5YHUY|5|A guys movie... The boys enjoyed it and said it was a bit sad too but great movie. Son in law loved it as well!
0553582011|2|It has been some time since I read this book. I borrowed it from my brother after he bought a hard cover copy to continue his George RR Martin book collection. I have read Martin's short stories (Song for Lya, Sand Kings, Voyage of Tuff, etc) and some of his more obscure books (Dying of the Light and that one vampire one). He is a good writer. Books 1-3 of A song of Ice and Fire are great. They are horrifically depressing, but great in terms of story telling.<br /><br />This book doesn't hold a candle to Tuff's Voyage (an unenjoyable book. This book doesn't belong in the same universe as books 1-3 of this series. Tyron's time spent on the river is worthless. He spends it complaining about killing his dad and staring at a priest woman's breasts. He finishes the book by riding on a pig.<br /><br />Characters were created and written about for this book just to let them die. I'd tell you the dudes name, but I don't remember it because every entry he had in the book was completely unmemorable. He just gets melted by a dragon after floundering to get Dany's attention. She, of course, is distracted by some gold toothed mercenary and spends the book dreaming about getting humped by him.<br /><br />I thought book 4 was bad. I figured this one was going to come through because it had all the main characters I cared about. I was sadly mistaken. Book 4 was more entertaining even if it was filled with sideshows.<br /><br />In the end I recommended my brother not read book 5. He stilt hasn't read book 4 because I told him to ignore it. I left the review at 2 stars instead of 1 because his writing is still excellent. His world is great. He just wrote the wrong story in it. I am hoping the last book will wrap this up.
B00CFNUMD0|5|This is a wonderful kids cartoon series.  Very clever and our grandkids (ages 11 and 5) love it.  I kind of like it myself.
0316017930|5|Outliers is a great book. I loved how the information was presented for the various types of 'outlier' achievers and the analysis was handled by Gladwell. It all makes perfect sense, yet this critical review of the info and topics shared within the book to demonstrate why people become outliers is truly enjoyable (and that great success is achievable!). Personally, it helped me see trends in my own behavior and skills as an entrepreneur and the practicality of 'practice makes perfect.' Highly recommend reading it!
0307408868|4|We had not previously read author Larson, but a friend pressed upon us this work of non-fiction with rave comments – even though the facts of the sinking of the Lusitania by a German U-boat during WWI are pretty well known, even as that event recedes into history not directly known to anyone still alive. That the author managed to sustain almost fabulous suspense throughout is quite a testament to his writing capabilities. Moreover, his research – at a guess, spanning more like years than months – was uncommonly thorough, unearthing all kinds of documents, eyewitness testimony, and the like as reflected in nearly a 50-page compendium of notes, references, and citations.<br /><br />Larson’s great storytelling had us caring about many of the passengers; and the alternating viewpoints of those aboard, especially the Captain, with those of the U-boat hunter, only added to the intrigue. And when the ship finally went down, the account was so compelling it may well move many a reader to tears. The pressures put upon then President Wilson to immediately enter the war (which occurred surprisingly yet two years later), not to mention details of his personal life, also added to the complexity of the event, not to mention the almost unbelievable reluctance of the Brits to better protect one of the most notable ships of the era. In case we tend to overlook the horrors of war, and its frequent impact on innocents, “Dead Wake” is surely a somber reminder and a captivating read.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I can spend hours playing this game. It is challenging and can be frustrating at times, however, you can advance without spending money as long as you are patient.

B00004R99M|3|We have ranked this at 23 out of 41 of the 41 animated movie Disney movies that we own.  I will do my best to explain why it wasn't ranked higher.  First is that we liked 22 other movies better.  Secondly, if I could edit out about an hour of this movie, it might well end up in the top 10.  <br />These assessments come from my children, who found that while they enjoyed much of the movie, sometimes the theatrical parts were to long and drawn out and just plain boring to children.  Watching real people right poorly drawn merry go round horses for 5 minutes sends them out of the room every time.  Watching the chimney sweeps dance for 5 minutes does the same.  It also seemed like the songs they liked were to short and the songs they didn't like were to long.<br />We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8, Fox and the hound 9, Cinderella is 10th, Rescuers 11, Hunchback of ND 12, Aladdin 13, Aladdin King of Thieves 14, Jungle Book 15, Little Mermaid 16, Hercules 17, Winnie the Pooh 18, Rescuers Down Under 19, Sword in the Stone 20, Pinocchio 21 and Mulan 22.
B00006CXSS|5|Does that work for you?<br />The people who say this movie isn't good all use the exact same reason.<br />They get offended because it didn't include their grandfather's regiment or whatever or they didn't cover the battles in Poland.<br />Well, the 101st couldn't be everywhere now could they?  THIS IS AN EXACT HISTORY OF THE 101ST AIRBORNE, 506 PIR.  End of story.<br />Get over yourself.<br />This is a great movie.
B002WY66FA|3|As for the music on this album, I would give it 5 stars! It's a great album.<br /> However, I'm writing this review in guards of this particular reissue by &#34;Plain Records&#34;. I do suggest that you own this album in one format or another, because it is a great album. I do not suggest picking up this album reissue by &#34;Plain Records&#34;.  This album, along with every other record I have by &#34;Plain Records,&#34; sounds like a poor quality mp3 recording. Don't by vinyl pressings by &#34;Plain Records&#34;, they all sound bad. (ie Mr. Bungle, Cat Power, etc. reissues)

140053271X|5|I'm one of those readers that loves buying physical books and who has avoided e-readers and e-books for as long as I could. I got my nook as a hand-me-down from my girlfriend's father who bought it and almost immediately realized he had no use for it. It's been sitting around the house for about two years now, getting extremely occasional use. Recently I've found myself in a situation where I have to purchase e-books regularly because many of my favorite authors are releasing novellas or short story collections without print versions, and this has come in extremely handy.<br /><br />Now that I've been using it more, I have to say I'm incredibly impressed by how well this technology that was designed in 2011 holds up today. I have zero complaints about it, hardware or software. I doubt I'll feel even the slightest urge to purchase a newer e-reader until this one bites the dust. The text is clear and crisp. The device itself is lightweight, feels good in the hand, and is pretty much the exact size and shape I would want--not too big, not too small.<br /><br />The software works perfectly for how I use it. The touchscreen works better than you'd expect. I've had no issues typing on it in the rare cases where I do need to type, and everything is simple to navigate. One minor touch I love is that when the device sleeps or when you lock it the screen shows a classy black and white drawing of a famous author. I'm sure the Kindle has something similar.<br /><br />One thing people might be frustrated by is that you can't just buy a book off Amazon and have it automatically sync over wifi or whispernet like you can with a Kindle. For me, that's not a problem. I rarely buy e-books. Usually, like I said, it's a new novella from a favored author which doesn't happen that frequently. Otherwise it's typically books I got from a humble e-book bundle. Since Amazon wouldn't automatically sync those to a kindle even if I had one, I've settled into using calibri to manage my e-book library and transfer over usb to my nook with the proper metadata and in the proper format (calibri can convert anything to anything and keeps the original intact). For those wondering, you CAN buy the kindle version of an e-book on amazon and get it on your nook using calibri fairly easily. There are guides out there that spell it all out, so just google it.rary and transfer over usb to my nook with the proper metadata and in the proper format (calibri can convert anything to anything and keeps the original intact).

B0010DGYJW|5|A true work of art. Great album. Great band. Long live rock and roll!
B00E8KLWB4|5|awesome game.  great graphics....challenging but not frustrating...I highly recommend it.  great way to pass the time.  lots of different types of games.
B002VPE1WK|4|A really great buy ! So reliable, reasonably prices and it has lots of pockets !
B00CWY76CC|3|I liked the challenge but when I got stuck and needed help I wished it didn't show everything. Only need to give small hints at a time.
B00364K6YW|5|I was absolutely pleased with this DVD edition. I ordered it because I will soon not have a VHS player and needed to have Pride & Prejudice always available.<br /><br />I had some misgivings about ordering this when I read reviews; some people said (1) the coloring was too blue, some said (2) the sound quality was terrible, some said (3) the interviews were boring. As to the first complaint, I definitely saw some wonderfully rosy complexions, so don't worry about that. The sound quality was just as good or even better than the VHS recording, and the interviews, while they didn't feature Jennifer Ehle or Colin Firthe, were still worth my time.<br /><br />I'll definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants a copy of Pride and Prejudice.
B0036S4B6M|5|Haven't watched the show yet, but now I feel like I need to binge watch it since I feel like I know all the characters. Hooked me from the very beginning & kept me hooked to the very end. Read it, people!
B00IRISI42|5|WOW
B004XJRQUQ|5|This series is by far the best I have ever read. With each turn in the plot, you won't be able to put the book down. An extraordinary masterpiece
B00BAXFECK|5|Suspenseful, and loved the characters. Author developed the Characters so well, I felt I could've shook their hands!  I learned a lot about art and the problems with art theft.
B00JCW0BCY|5|So well written, I found it to be informative and helpful .  We need a road map to help guide the way on our Independent life adventure.  I am very thankful to have read this book.  It settled some questions I was thinking.  Thank you
0380789035|5|Great book read it at work and liked it so much I had to buy it for at home.
B004LOMB2Q|5|I am not a good organizer.  but this app has helped me get it together.  I can make to do lists and they are available on my kindle, my phone and my computer.  share info with family or colleague,  done.  store reference pdf files. done. really a great app.
B004W2UBYW|4|This book offers a very insightful view into how the computer age began. It captures the strife and challenges of the varied views on business, friendships, and human nature. A very good read and I would recommend it to anybody with an interest in learning more about Apple and ita beginnings.
B002MQYOFW|4|Good story. The first book is the best but I wanted to finish the story so I read all 3.
B0026O475M|5|Love the movie. Did not like the amazon prime price point.
B0076DELIG|5|I'm a Michael Connelly fan and I love Harry Bosch books. This is really a good read. You will find it hard to put down.
B005XQLBU4|5|Looks great on the Motorola Xoom. Great graphics and great gameplay. Easy controls as well. Recommended for everyone. Worth the $.99.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Wonderful
B00005JLWN|5|Rather then repeating everything previous reviewers have said on here, I will just say one thing:  Believe the reviews you read on here and not the critics reviews.  For some reason this movie got knocked by critics big time.  The only way I would compare it to the Matrix sequels is to say it's a much better movie then either of them were.  This is a great, original movie.  It's a sci-fi movie with some plot and substance which is something a lot of new sci-fi movies are lacking.
B001HRJG2S|5|Excellent!
B0051T47NQ|5|I first stumbled across this movie on Netflix and ended up buying it outright. This is a great movie to watch on a Friday night with lights off and a big bowl of popcorn - a good piece of entertainment. It's a bit scarier than I expected it to be so it's not good for kids (of course, the subtitles will turn them off, anyway). This movie has already been circulated around my office!
B009G7ZYPY|4|I love Susan Boyle, but I feel that the producers have zapped what we loved about her, that she was feisty and spunky and funny and had amazing singing chops.  Why not include at least one uptempo and/or one comedy song?  My favorite on here is the duet with Donny \\"This is the Moment\\".  They took a song which is usually done over the top and bombastic and made it beautiful and still powerful.<br />I would like to see Susan and the producers do some original songs too.  My still all time fave song of Susan's is \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\".<br />Give Susan some of her zip back.<br />Still, am so happy for her and her career!!<br />Keep singing with the angelic voice God has given you!!
B00QROI70S|5|This would be among my favorites of the Marvel films so far.
B001TKD4ZI|4|It was good not a great book but I'm already hooked on the series.
B00992CF6W|5|It takes much longer to convert the data usage from a computer to a kindle. I know lots of you are 10 and clueless about computer memory&hellip; But don't wage saying the app is bad because it's not caught up. Also... don't say it's. bad if you don't know the controls.
B00G32OER4|3|modern day exorcism kind of predictable. definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't think kids under say 14 should watch this.
B00BIPCY14|5|--this show is so much more nuanced and well written than I expected.  I originally choose not to watch it because I disliked the title and had other programs I wanted to see.  Now I am glad I waited anyway, because being able to follow the story at my own pace (I.e., binging!) allows me to appreciate the quality of content and character development more.  I am especially impressed by how richly Chris Noth has portrayed his character, whom a lesser talent could easily have been content to render in one dimension while Mr. Noth steadily added depth and perspectives that make me reluctantly start to care about him as Season 1 progresses.  I look forward to watching all the other season's!
B005FLX1HS|5|It was a gift for my grandson and it was just what he requested.  I'm sure  he'll enjoy it!  I have not idea what it's about!
B0071XO8RA|5|Awesome read. Kept me entertained until the end. I Cant wait for the next book in the series! Thank you!
B00ECU2RGY|5|I loved the visuals and story, as well as the ending... can't wait till the sequel comes out!  I wouldn't say this is Tom's best performance but it wasn't a bomb either.
B002KSPKRS|5|The sound quality of these headphones is amazing. The Surround Sound helps tremendously with many of the games I play. The best feature for the xbox is chat boost and the simple ability to hear chat and game sound though the same headphones. These headphones can also be use with any device with and digital audio port or a normal left right line in. You may want to cheat the Turtle Beach website to see what exactly come with them and what you can buy that is extra.    Pros  Sound Quality  Surround Sound  Xbox Chat  Chat Boost  Removable mic boom  Very comfortable fit - Over the ear and cloth mesh make for a very easy were on any size of ear    Cons  Uses batteries fast - I highly suggest buying some AAA rechargeable batteries. These headphone will eat through a pair in two days depending on how much you use them.  Slight interference - You will hear a slight hum whenever the headphones are turn on, and if you have a strong wireless network and you a far away from the headphone tower you may hear some snaps and pops    Other  I will note that while playing a normal or loud game you will not able to hear anything in the surrounding area besides the game and chat, whether this is a good or bad thing depends on a person's personal preferences. ;-)    Final Thought  These headphones are not cheap, but are the best quality I have ever seen. If you want a slightly less expensive pair I would suggest the Ear Force X31 which are stereo.

B0063IH60K|4|My wife uses this when she isn't playing solitaire on her laptop.  She likes it and spends a little time with the game when she gets into it.
B00992CF6W|3|I'm sure I could provide it with a better rate once my son figures it all out.  Download was easy and he seems to be getting it.  Was helpful at Chrismas with the family when the older boys had played it before.
B0030N3O8Y|5|Awesome!!
B0055SWM08|5|Very soothing while still being totally engaging. Beautiful graphics and sounds add to the allure of this game. If you can only have one game - this is the one to have.
B000000H3Z|5|Sepultura's 1989 release, Beneath the Remains, marked the band's transition from third-world obscurity to major contenders in the international extreme metal arena. As soon as the deceptively gentle acoustic intro gives way to the title track's thrashing brutality, the listener is propelled at maximum speed and intensity through to the very last crunch of &quot;Primitive Future.&quot; In between, Sepultura offers its first bona fide hits with &quot;Inner Self&quot; and the inspired &quot;Stronger Than Hate,&quot; featuring lyrics written by Atheist's Kelly Shaefer. It's not over there, as they charge ahead with the triple threat of &quot;Mass Hypnosis,&quot; &quot;Sarcastic Existence,&quot; and &quot;Slaves of Pain,&quot; all of which feature mind-blowing solos from guitarist Andreas Kisser, thunderous double-bass work from drummer Igor Cavalera, and the furious howling of singer Max Cavalera. The complete absence of filler here makes this one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time.
0060752610|4|4 stars for it being the book that Warren Buffett has read and Benjamin Graham being the father of value investing.
B00C81AVNU|5|great soundtrack
B00IFOOPM2|4|Good.... True to the show .... Maybe a little predictable.. But really good... A lot of through backs to the original show .... Everyone is all grown up.. Not a high school show anymore.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|Great book. Losts of details and facts in a format that is easy to read.
0062282697|5|This book was exactly what I needed. I wanted to know what was the best way to learn a new language . Benny's book answered to all my questions. If you want to learn the secret to be multilingual you should check fluent in 3 months. Benny knows the way !;-)
B00005U8EM|5|This film has its place as a \\"Ground Breaking\\" idea.  It's comedy is will placed, subtle and genuinely funny.<br /><br />Some films, such as Star Trek, are trying to come up with warped ideas 100% of the time.  Good as food-for-thought, but it can get tedious towards the end of a series.<br /><br />I have truly enjoyed watching Groundhog Day for the 2nd time, which is probably enough for any film - otherwise it starts to become a Groundhog Day of our own.<br /><br />After the first time I came away with the feeling that the whole purpose was for our hero to win a bedroom conquest.  On second thoughts it was not so gratuitous (mainly because it isn't overdone).  But it still seems strange that it is the aim of the whole plotline.  Why can't they simply fall in love and then Groundhog Day be over?
B00FKF0F3C|5|loved it !
B007FZ7QAA|5|Breezy did that!! This album is so so dope. Almost every single song is good. I love me some Chris and every last one of his albums are fire
B000FC2L1Y|4|I love the continuing saga!  Her character development is outstanding.  The dialogue is genuine and insightful.
B00KA87GCW|4|But energy becomes scarce as levels increase. I don't buy in app though so that is probably the constraint. Quests keep it interesting.
B0014NDXGA|5|I purchased this rangefinder back in June and it has exceeded my expectations. This Bushnell rangefinder not only is easy to use, but very accurate. The best part is my golf game has improved by being able to make a more exact club selection. Thanks Busnell! Highly recommend![[ASIN:B00BLR484K BUSHNELL 201930 TOUR V2 LASER RANGEFINDER PINSEEKER]]
B00991TCOG|5|Who is Lindsey Stirling and why should I buy this album? you might ask.  She's a young solo artists who combines her love of dance & music into a fantastic display of what it means to love life and live it to the fullest.<br />Check her out on Youtube:  \\"Spontaneous Me\\", \\"Elements\\", \\"Skyrim\\" (with Peter Hollens - check out his video \\"The Prayer\\" he did with his wife),  and you'll be hooked.  Her videos are Filmed by Devin Graham (\\"Devinsupertramp\\" in Youtube) whose masterful cinematography captures every move in stunning HD.  These three young artists use modern recording tools and Youtube and sites like Amazon & iTunes which allows artists like these three to remain fully independent and yet produce top quality, professional grade work.<br /><br />Lindsey is full of life, and is very dynamic.  Her work is not recycled.  She sticks to her scruples and does not compromise and it's refreshing to see that in a world where young artists are pressured early on to do and be just what their producers & record companies want them to be.<br /><br />When listening to her music, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wanna dance!<br />Enjoy
B004V6VGHU|5|I still can't believe that this is a used book.  I was practically untouched.  What an unbelievable product for an amazing price.  Thanks again.<br /><br />Eddie O
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is addictive I can't stop playing it wish u offer more lives then just five. But beside that everything else is good.
B00992CF6W|5|I love the game it is fun and hard at the same time. People that do not play the is missing out
0345803485|5|Caveat: This book has to be one of THE most entertaining, jaw dropping, intense reads I have EVER read. And I know books.<br /><br />Review: Everyone is saying how \\"CHILDISH\\" the book is and how particular words repeat but did you ever consider--THAT'S HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE READ? I swear people can be so naive in what they say that is hurts my soul. E L James didn't force you to read the book. She could have, and did, become a best seller WITHOUT your opinion. This book is very well put together. For such a young character, Ana learns so much about herself in such a short amount of time. One thing I would love to commend Ms. James on is the way she portrays the character in such a light that we haven't seen in other books. While others are burying their heads in useless junk about vampires and wolves, this trilogy gives everyone the opportunity to read something worthwhile.<br /><br />Good day.
B007IXWL2C|5|Best of the three books. Will there be more to tis series. First time I had read any of her
B008G8SFGO|5|After being mildly disappointed with Sonic Boom, I didn't have great expectations about Monster.  Instead, I found myself really enjoying it.  There are no instant classics on it (although \\"All For The Love Of Rock & Roll\\" comes close), but there are no songs that I want to skip either (like the last three songs of Psycho Circus).  The thing I like most about this album is the return to riff-driven songs.  In the 80's, KISS moved more towards power chords and away from the riffs that gave their 70's a distinctive sound.  There are still plenty of power chords on Monster, but songs like \\"Wall of Sound\\" remind me of the KISS I fell in love with as a teen.
B00102FELM|5|Well, I must say that this is one of the best live DVDS that I've seen in a while!! Great to hear the hit songs, but also good to hear some that aren't played that often. I enjoyed seeing Michael Schenker and Uli Jon Roth jam with them!!
B0027BOL4G|5|We all need to eat food to survive the question is what is in our food that is exactly what this film talks about from different angles first of all the corporate control angle: TYSON, CARGILL, SWIFT, & NATIONAL BEEF CONTROL 80% OF THE BEEF MARKET, and now we move over to THE PORK MARKET OF WHICH 80% IS CONTROLLED BY TYSON, CARGILL, SWIFT, & SMITHFIELD. Rather than farmers working for themselves, now they're called GROWERS, VINCE EDWARDS IS A TYSON GROWER WHO HAS A CHICKEN FARM, CAROLE MARISON IS A PERDUE GROWER, SHE HAS THE INNER COURAGE AND CONVICTION TO CRITICIZE PERDUE SHE SAYS &#34;THIS IS NOT FARMING THIS IS MASS PRODUCTION LIKE IN A FACTORY.&#34; A typical grower with 2 chicken houses has borrowed over $500,000 and earns about $18,000 a year.<br />Did you know that 30% of farm land in the U.S. is being planted with corn, here are a few products that have some form of corn in them: KETCHUP, CHEESE, TWINKIES, BATTERIES, PEANUT BUTTER, CHEEZ-ITS, SALAD DRESSING, COKE, JELLY, SWEET & LOW, SYRUP, JUICE, KOOL-AID, CHARCOAL, DIAPERS, MOTRIN, MEAT, AND FAST FOOD, corn is also a major part of animal feed for cows, even certain fish feed has corn ingredients in it.<br />Here are some interesting points made in this film:<br />1. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN EATS 200 POUNDS OF MEAT PER-PERSON PER-YEAR.<br />2. RATHER THAN HAVING COW FARMS WE NOW HAVE CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS(CAFOs) THESE COWS ARE FED CORN NOT GRASS.<br />3. REMEMBER THE E-COLI OUTBREAKS-COW MANURE IN BEEF.<br />4. IN 1972 THE FDA CONDUCTED APPROXIMATELY 50,000 FOOD SAFETY INSPECTIONS.<br />5. IN 2006 THE FDA CONDUCTED 9,164 FOOD SAFETY INSPECTIONS.<br />6. IN THE 1970s THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SLAUGHTER HOUSES IN THEU.S.( I PERSONALLY REMEMBER THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES ON 14th STREET & 10th AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY) AS OF 2008 THERE ARE 13 SLAUGHTER HOUSES IN THE ENTIRE U.S.<br />A very compelling segment of this film is when BARBARA KOWALCYK & HER MOTHER BECOME FOOD SAFETY ADVOCATES FOLLOWING THE DEATHOF BARBARA'S 2 & A HALF YEAR OLD SON KEVIN, HE DIED FROM AN E-COLI INFECTION. This film also talks about the connection between fast-food and diabetes:<br />1. 1 IN 3 AMERICANS BORN AFTER THE YEAR 2000 WILL CONTACT EARLY ONSET DIABETES.<br />2. AMONG MINORITIES THAT RATE WILL 1 IN 2.<br />There is also a very interesting segment about the monstrous corporation MONSANTO, at the end of this film there are easy to follow suggestions of how this fight against the food corporations can be fought and won by us the everyday paying customers, every person in America needs to watch this educational and informative DVD film.

B00BUCW54Q|5|I am not a big Tom Cruise fan.  But I think he did a great job staying true to his character and not over-acting.  There was a lot of action and suspense in this movie.  It also keeps you guessing.  I knew nothing of the Jack Reacher novel series and the movie has inspired me to read some of the novels this movie is based on.  I would recommend this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Wow! So good. Characters so real.  A page turner of a book. Couldn't put down. All of us mothers could put a name to the main character.
B00A8FXT8M|4|A clever book, sad and at times frustrating, but believable and touching. It's old fashioned in its delivery, a lot of narrative summary, but it's still a treasure.
B008GJV2OA|4|I liked the concept of the movie, I just don't know if I thought it was That Funny.
B000F5GNX8|5|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang...I never even heard of this movie until I watched it at a friends house. Goes to show this movie didn't get much publicity, which came as a shock to me after viewing the film because I thought it was brilliantly put together. \\"KKBB\\" comes from the screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) as his directing debut.    First off, if you get offended by vulgarous language this film is not for you. If you can look past the F word being said after every other word than you'll enjoy it thoroughly!    \\"KKBB\\" is a dry humoristic murder mystery starring Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart, a New York petty thief who steals everything and in the midst of running away form a robbery gone awry he ends up auditioning for a part in a movie and later ends up in L.A. From there he is set up with Gay Perry, a gay private detective who is also a consultant for movies played by Val Kilmer, who helps him out in the tangled murder mystery. While in L.A. Harry runs into his long lost high school crush, Harmony Faith Lane, played by Michelle Monaghan who asks for help from Harry in solving the case that involves her kid sister because she thinks that he is really a private detective.     The combination of these three fascinating characters creates a dynamic, exhilarating and exciting presence that is sure to have your complete attention on the screen at all times trying to make sure not to miss a thing...believe me you don't want to miss anything. With the witty brilliant dialogue, unexpected surprises, and hot action it's sure to leave you pleased...well most of you.    Downey delivers in this film with excellency, proving to me that he is an under-rated actor not given enough credit for his ambiguous performance. The only thing I have against his character is how surprisingly amazing of a gunslinger he becomes at the end of the movie...but than again he is an \\"amazing magician\\".     Val Kilmer plays by far the coolest, yet meanest and most hardcore gay dude in this movie. His character is very blunt and straight forward...or in his case would you call it gay forward?    This movie receives 5/5 stars from me for it's creativity, originality and sense of humor. Here's a line from the movie that I enjoyed....    Gay Perry: Do me a favor, go look up the word idiot in the dictionary and tell me what you find.  Harry: Let me guess, a picture of me?  Gay Perry: No idiot! The definition for idiot because that's what you are!
B0000WN0ZK|2|Maybe that's the whole point. Blow Up is about empty people living empty lives. That's fine, as long as the film they are in entertains me. But Blow Up is a bore. Nothing happens. You wait patiently. The film moves at snail's pace. Blow Up represents the most aimless tendencies of foreign film. It has a French-like tendency (desire?) to meander. Blow Up has at best thirty minutes of content stretched to nearly two hours.<br />  Characters act cold and distant and more than a bit cruel. The movie ends with mimes (never a good sign) pretending to play tennis in the park. Fin. Credits roll. What does it all mean? And why should I care? Films do not have to have a point. A character up to his neck in ennui who is on an existential quest to nowhere (as in Eyes Wide Shut) is okay. But if your film has nothing to say, make it interesting--either visually or in its dialogue. But Blow Up takes a mimimalistic approach. Long silences. Little action. No emotion. It is about an hour into the movie that something finally \\"happens\\"--a seeming murder. I thought the film might take a Hitchcockian turn. But it doesn't. Was the man in the park murdered? Did the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) have him killed? Why was the body left there? Was he cheating with her, or was she cheating with him? We never get the answer to such questions, because no one in the movie cares enough to find out. Is this a statement about the vacuousness of 60s culture? I guess. A postmodern statement about man's indifference to man? Maybe. But I didn't care enough about the characters to care about the movie's message (if there is one). Blow Up represents a view so world weary that naked romping (scandalous then, tame by today's standards) by supermodels and a cameo by the Yardbirds (yes, that's Jimmy Page) can't lighten the mood. Is Blow Up an embrace of \\"cool\\" or a rejection of it? Who knows? I can only be sure that this movie was deserved grist for the Austin Powers parody mill. Mike Myers movies are fun. Blow Up is not.is not.
B003XURDAY|5|Classic 80s sci fi.
0143124544|5|loved loved LOVED this book! we read it for book club, wow amazing points of view and really explains how we all have our own decisions and ways of working things out- shows love for family, friends, and a story of what a quadriplegic may have to go through. blessings all around-
B00881VLCE|4|This puzzle app is so relaxing; it distracts me from the stresses of the day while still engaging my mind in enjoyment. My only negative comment is that the amazon Appstore often fails to launch or responds slowly/ inconsistently...then it is not relaxing.
B0031KC8OC|5|I read about this series, and finally got to view it before the movie. Kristen Bell makes the series, she brings the character to life. Very talanted and smart...the real deal.
B005PK57IK|5|Great drama with wonderful plots and terrific cast. I never saw it the first time around but now I'm binge-watching!
B002BWP49C|5|My niece LOVES this movie

B000GG4Y32|5|Warren Beatty has made a beautiful, epic film about the times leading up to and just after the Russian Revolution, tracing the life of John Reid, who wrote \\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\", and his involvement in left wing journalism and politics in the US and then in the fledgling USSR. Great performances by Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton are highlights. This film held our interest for its entire 3+ hour length. I have looked forward to the release of this film on DVD for a long time, having had a strong memory of its original theatrical release. A must for any serious film-lover's collection.
0385335482|5|The Shopaholic books are excellant for no-brainer humor and entertainment.  If you feel like reading an amusing series, grab a glass of wine or cola, relax and have fun.  Great easy reading when you just want to have fun and not use your brain cells.  If you enjoyed Bridgett Jones or The Nanny Diaries, you will probably enjoy this one, too.
0451204530|2|Of course the protagonist lost not only his memory but had the misfortune to fall into an alternative universe where in 1958 there existed the concept of xeroxing documents along with Cadillac Eldorados and Ford Fiestas, which in our universe came along many years later.  I too would have been as confused as our less-than-intrepid author, and I too would have lapsed into insipid dialog and unreal plot twists.<br />Mr. Follett gives great credit at the end of the book to his researchers, etc., who helped him.  Too bad none of them had the brains to do any research into contemporary history.<br />For shame, Mr. Follett.
B00ESGYQWA|5|Great modern version of the unforgettable Shakespearean classic!
B0086700CM|5|I really love the game on my other devices, but on my kindle fire it keeps telling me to add a credit card. I think it's because you can make in game purchases, but it never asked for that on any other games where you can do that. Kinds made me sad... but it's still a great game.
B004I2K4DY|5|Without a doubt, this is the BEST video I've ever purchased and viewed!  The songs were sung with passion and great enunciation.  I'm still humming and singing 5 days later!  Thanks to the producers and artists who produced this.  I've seen this \\"live\\" and also the 10th anniversry video.....this 25th anniversary edition is the BEST.
0312360258|1|I am a 38 year old mother who has read the Twilight books. Loved them. I was hoping that this would be the next series that I could get into. Not. I was shocked at the talk of sex and the language that was used. I hope not all teenagers out there are reading this. At least I wouldn't want my daughter reading it. Trust me I know that kids \\"know\\" about this stuff, but they shouldn't be reading it.
B008FRFN7A|5|A really helpful app, especially if you have just purchased an HP ePrinter, which we have.
B00FEMJF6O|4|I am having fun playing this game. I have not had to spend any money yet and have been able to enjoy playing. As long as you don't mind waiting for things to be finished, you can have a good time also.
B005G4TJUC|5|Transformers is one my favorite action movies because Optimus Prime and Megatron are my favorite characters Optimus prime is my hero of Transformers. Revenge of the fallen was great and the first transformers were good. dark of the moon was the best.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|This is a really fun game.  The graphics are great. This is a good game for all ages. Try it and you will see. Mamalena
B00SI7GCJK|5|Great movie. Good acting. It's not hard to follow if you put your phone down and pay attention.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Downton Abbey is by far the best series I have ever watched.  I have watched it twice!! I'm really looking forward to Season 4.
B005XQLBU4|3|This is a good shoot em up game. Kind of repetitive after a while.  Good for on the train or bus.<br /> You get what you pay for.
B00BW6SOIQ|4|I love James Spader (if you aren't watching the Black List, get on it!)  This was an interesting film for sure, but I kinda liked it, if only for James.  It kind of reminds me of a lighter version of 50 Shades of Grey.  Just for fun, nothing serious here guys, try it you might like it. :)
B00I2KAUZU|4|Better than I expected.  A must have to add to your DB collection.
B000XR4OC0|1|I bought these shoes for mmy wife for Mothers day, They did not last two months the heels blew out. I went to the local retsiler who sent them back and said Tom's would not waranty them. I contacted toms numerous times via email and live chat on thier website but no solution was offered. I would notr buy these and send the money to Food for the poor instead.
B004ZH66XO|3|Move your fish around the screen eating smaller fishes and avoiding bigger fishes. Progress through the levels with your fish doing almost exactly the same thing each level. This game is almost the same as Feeding Frenzy. The developers point out that in this version of the game you can drag your fish around your touch screen. I found that even on my Thunderbolt the screen is far too small to do this as your hand blocks your view. Fortunately, you can switch back to the joystick controls.<br /><br />If you like Feeding Frenzy you will like this game. I did somewhat and do somewhat. It was an okay game when free, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B002SSUQFG|3|Don't run well.And the time in it is uncorrect.
B0002XH9Z4|5|Since Roger Friedman of Fox New's wrote an article (not entirely true), reviewers are so easily fed into what they hear, have come on here. <br /> <br />Its sad to think what aspects affect people's choices. A reviewer says they can't buy this because of legal ordeals. That should not affect your choice of purchasing an item. Though a man can be easily extorted, you should not beleive everything you hear. <br /> <br />Think about this: He is the biggest selling artist of all time, captivated us with his unbeleivable music, and set world records that no one could beat: neither Elvis nor the Beatles.  <br /> <br />So to say that legal woes will keep you from buying a masterpiece, then I feel sorry for you. Until then, gain some common sense: he's innocent!
B004DI7HZ6|4|The book had its slow moments, but the characters drew me in enought that I couldn't wait to get a hold of the second book.
B00MB6IYHW|5|Awesome movie so much fun for whole family
B00PMRRTS2|5|A very candid insight into a disease that so many families are experiencing in this day & age. The harsh realities of how Alzheimers Disease affects not only the person, but the whole family, friends, colleagues & everyone around them. This book was full of love & compassion and beautifully written from Alice's view.
B00HY7VU60|5|EXCELENT
0307949508|5|The story continues and the writing is still excellent.  I love the way the story moves and again, it is difficult to stop once you start reading.
0802473156|5|Since this book first came out, I have bought quite a few copies to give to people that I felt really could benefit.  I always get good feedback from those I have given this book to.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|this is a great game for passing time. it can be very very additive.  like all hidden object games you need to.wsi

B009UX2YAC|5|Great game... I enjoy the updates that seem to come up monthly. I play it every day and have gotten several friends addicted too!!!
1587613379|4|Re-read (first read of new edition) and though it's been years and years since the first read, nothing here was really new or mind-awakening for me.<br /><br />I still think it is an excellent resource for exploring polyamory, whether because it's a journey you yourself are on or are considering, or even if you're just expanding your education in sex positive subject matter. I make sure my potential more-than-casual partners read it or have read it.<br /><br />Actually, onething did stand out for me semi-heavily this read: the section on the \\"single slut.\\" I'm quite confident now that it really described me and where I am right now. And I'm OK with that.
B0048WQDIE|1|I am sure that &#34;those in the know&#34; will think my review uniformed and that I just don't get the brilliance of this book and that is fine, we are all entitled to our opinions. This has been a miserable boring waste of time for me. I have managed to struggle through 60 or so pages and I don't think I can bring myself to read a single page more. I typically set my bailout time at 100 pages, and I have forced my way through some real literary turds, but I don't think I am even going to waste another minute of reading time on this one. The rambling almost incoherent train of thought type of writing seems to serve no purpose other than to get across the idea that a bunch of military officers are each crazy in their own special ways and shouldn't be flying, but if they ask to be removed from combat flights because they are crazy then they are deemed sane and sent off for more missions because knowing you are crazy proves you are sane.  I feel like this is an case of the emperor's new clothes, everyone says you should like this book and that it is a classic and so people find a way in their own head to make the story fit what they are told it should be. I am just thankful I wasn't asked to read this mess in high school like some poor people were.
B00BMT9C84|2|REALLY disappointed! Wanted to like this, but found Barbara Streisand more annoying than funny. Couldn't even finish to see if it got any bettter
B00AEFY5TI|3|The quality is good just did not realize it was for wide screen so it is a little strange on my old analog TV.
B000YJ85BI|4|I felt the author employed sufficient science along with a good plot to keep me interested from front to back. Unfortunately I did not read the 2 previous books in the series which I would rate as EXCELLENT. Scalzi's development of aliens and their interactions with humans is a highlight of the novel.
B007L5LD9O|3|I didn't finish this movie because I got bored of it.
B00W3V83QW|3|Love this game . My only complaint is it freezes a lot on my Kindle. Could be just a problem with my device. When I get it to play, I really enjoy it.
B0086700CM|5|This game is loads of fun I have to force myself to stop playing so that I can get dinner on the table.
B006LKY1A8|5|...this film was done well in every way, despite concerns about the truth being stretched a bit. It is still a privilege to watch.
B00821OX98|4|Lots of suspense, this is something my teenage boys really enjoy, maybe more so when I'm constantly started. They are excited for the other season, and I'm so thankful it's part of the Prime offering.
B00GLX1MG6|4|Enjoyed this silly romp about drugs and family comedy. I thought it had just a touch too much of sexual inuendos.
B004A8ZWW4|5|this is a great action movie about the underdog holding to the end to become a top dog fighting the champs
B00AIQP9DE|4|This game is pretty good. I liked the graphics, the story line and the characters. What I didn't Like was the price, this game is too short for the price.
B0049GYXDG|5|Bravo, Disney! After reading the glowing reviews of this highly underrated Disney Classic, I finally picked up a copy today. Thinking I would hit 'Play' and do some work while it provided some background noise, I found myself glued to the screen for the entire film. The Blu-ray edition is nothing short of a miracle; pristine from beginning to end! Grab your copy before it goes back into the vault. You won't be disappointed.
B00IHMEAYA|5|Dorrigo emerges from poverty in a Tasmanian village to become a physician rising into the middle class of his fiance Ella. The War with Japan takes him to a military base in Adelaide, into the life of the enchantress Amy - regrettably his uncle's wife.  Abruptly shipped to Singapore just before it falls to Japan, Dorrigo is the officer and doctor in charge of 1000 Aussie soldiers in a horrific POW camp where the sick and starving slaves are driven to build a railroad to Burma with crude tools and pilfered materials. Dorrigo understands that his mission is to help the men he loves to survive. He fashions systems of care and sanitation, always displaying  a belief in their humanity and ability to overcome, even as hundreds are dying of disease, starvation and the brutality of their guards. The loyalty of the men to him and to each other is their miraculous tonic. After the peace, Dorrie reluctantly returns home. All the survivors struggle to adapt after their horrors. For Dorrie this means marriage to Ella whom he cannot love for many years. While his career and fame grow, Dorrego seduces women but commits to no one but his memory of Amy. (In one spell-binding episode, Dorrie rescues his wife and children from a raging fire in the forests near Hobart, revealing that his love for them can perhaps only be revealed when they are endangered and he is their savior.)  The novel culminates in glimpses of the POWs as they age, and Flanagan boldly carries that story of the war's aftermath into the perspective of aging Japanese officers. What did their agony on the doomed railroad Line mean? Were any of them righteous in their own estimations? War, cruelty, friendship, love, betrayal, guilt, and always more love arising from the muddy slough of one of history's most inhumane and inglorious wars. Dorrigo cannot accept his heroic self. Nonetheless,he is the great hero of this epic, and Richard Flanagan has written courageously about the war that is sacred in our appreciation of the Greatest Generation, but which disabled the spirits of many that survived. Dorrigo Evans will become the anti-hero that begins to give us a more authentic hero for the Pacific War. Tasmania has given us a great writer for the millennium. The Booker Mann prize is well-deserved, but this novel should be destined for a Nobel.
B007P6VLRS|1|Dear Billy,<br />Why don't you write no good hooks no more? Why don't you sing like you used to and whatnot? And whats with them doppelgangers you got in the band now? Maybe you think we ain't looking and you can sneak some look-alikes by us and what-have-you. But I seen what you done. I seen everthing. I seen right through you.
B00CWY76CC|5|Loving this game,it's challenging and fun! I enjoy the fact that it's not soo difficult you want to give up! The balance is just right and it makes you feel clever!
B0086700CM|4|It is a great game, but a few glitches. I have it on my kindle fire. You can not get coins unless you own an android, which was a bummer. Sometimes it is also a little slow. But I can not complain because it is free. And besides the glitches it is super fun and addicting. I would definitely download it. You will be sorry if you don't!
B005NFJAZS|5|It was magic when it was first released, and it is still magic.
B006X08FDA|5|This is a great CD for anyone who enjoys and appreciates mainly traditional Old Time songs and tunes done in a lively foot thumping style.
B001TH44VY|5|I love this movie; I've seen it numerous times, so I'm probably biased.  If you like Mozart and period cinematography, then you will like Amadeus!
B000002VSN|5|This movie was a very good movie with Whitney Houston & Denzel Washington. I support everything that she does and the soundtrack was very good and a must have!!
B00ZZ08Q1K|5|Always a great show.  Sorry to hear their last season is coming up
B005MLOOJA|5|I love this show! The acting is superb, the writing is phenomenal...everything about it is top notch! My entire family is in the legal field and we all are huge fans. So refreshing to have a show that actually does its research on the storylines. I find that they stay very true (mostly) to the law and courtroom procedure....with a little creative license thrown in for tension. All I can say is....More, Please!
0345803493|5|A great read!
B006T3RM08|5|I don't know what some of the folks are complaining about but the Clique is fantastic! The quality of the case is great. The keyboard and the trackpad fit inside the case extremely well. The 2 buttons that allow you acces to the power buttons on the keyboard and the trackpad are a brilliant idea. I'm using the Clique to consolidate the keyboard and the trackpad for my HTPC and it works really well. Once in the case, the whole unit feels nice and solid, yet light. The white color of the Clique makes the whole setup look like a stock Apple product, which is nice visually. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and I would highly recommend it!
B00DPM90C4|4|I enjoyed this clever stroy, the plot is intricate but held together in a masterly way. The first person narrative gives the characters and their individual stories an immediacy which is compelling. An excellent read!
B00BWJARHO|3|A little flat, but some moving moments. some special effects were tired looking like the cut-rate version of the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy.
0142000655|5|I just finished this novel a few hours ago after 3 days of continuous reading. This will probably be one of my favorite books i've ever read. One who reads the book will grow with adam, cal, aron and lee. I don't read much but i cannot give this book enough stars. So descriptive, one will get lost in the dusty west.
B00005OWIU|3|I have been a John Williams fan for some time now.  Since his music in Star Wars, E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones grabbed my ears and my attention, I have followed the music where ever it played.  When he did Harry Potter though, I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, John Williams is incredibly talented in movie scores, but the first Harry Potter he slipped a bit.<br /><br />John used to be able to make music so when you listen to it you can visualize the scene.  In this CD you can't for some of the tracks.<br /><br />Besides that small thing, I would recommend this to any fan of John Williams or any soundtrack lover.  In the end Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone-Soundtrack gets 3 Stars out of 5.<br /><br />My name is Amone. Adios!
B00G91Z8AQ|5|It's a great re-telling of the story. No spoilers but the format of the story done in flashbacks was pretty cool.
B00IZY8CZS|5|When you've got such inspiring source material it's hard ( though not impossible) to screw it up.All the performers on this disc do a good to great job of interpreting the music of Ronnie James Dio.I thouroughly enjoyed this and highly recommend it .
B000FC2L1E|5|The journeys of Claire and Jamie are so accurate to the locations, human responses, and history.  Diana Gabaldon has created a world where as you read you can smell the smoke, feel the coldness of the Highlands, and see the colors while taking part in the story she has woven.  Best read ever and I read all genres and average less than a book a week.
B00DFFHUUA|4|Good movie
B009NY43NY|1|It was not terribly interesting throughout. It lacked much of the sense of humor the earlier novels had.  Let's hope the show does better.
B001ECPJZO|4|With little grandkids this was a good learning tool.  Tying shoes is not an easy task but this seemed to help get the concept across. Still have a couple little ones to go and even the bigger one likes playing with it after mastering the tie idea.
B004MC8CA2|4|I got YouBible for use on my Windows Mobile phone.  It is the only app that does well on Windows Mobile 7 and up that is also free.  It is very powerful, has multiple Bible translations, lots of resources, and audio versions as well as text versions. Overall it is really cool.<br />My one complaint is that YouBible only works while on-line. The Windows Mobile version does not yet have an off-line version.
B00A8ECU24|5|Because it's really fun to play for all at ages no matter what anyone says it's for all ages the funest part is when your playing collect the apples or connect the stars or something like that but the game is just over all fun to play.
B005LAJ1H2|5|I just love Charlie Cox's performance, not sure who to root for but it is compelling. I want all of their outfits.
B000004286|5|So many great scores have come before this, providing films with the perfect accompaniment. But some are both perfect for the movie, as well as independently as music. This score, beautifully composed by the brilliant James Horner, enchants and relaxes us. The flow of the music is so smooth that one you have listened to the whole score, it seems too flawless to be real. I love this movie, and the score is too sensual to ignore. It is the very root of what makes this a great world in which to live.
B00H87RLJQ|5|good book-holds your interest!!
B005ZOBNOI|4|I read &#34;The Fault in our Stars&#34; by John Green today. I often hesitate with ratings and reviews because the judgment of a reader towards a beloved, boring, or satisfying book is so inequitable. How does one compare &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34; against &#34;Leaves of Grass&#34;, or rate &#34;The Upanishads&#34; using the same classifiers as one does with &#34;Gone Girl&#34;? How does our own subjectivity play out within a five point system? A book is capable of touching me on many levels. Who am I to say that certain levels are better than others? And yet, as a subjective person, I find some writing more meaningful to me than others.<br /><br /> What I can state is whether a book touched me or not. I can assess whether a book surprised me, challenged me, left me with a sense of wonder, lifted me, seduced me, or simply passed time pleasantly. There are also books that cannot move me past the first few pages. How meaningful that should be to anyone else is uncertain. As an avid bibliophile, my proclivities in books somewhat define me. I often hold them close, not even singly, but en total, as a treasure that I would rather not discuss. The gifts within books reveal themselves to me the way a pyramid accumulates width and depth, stone by stone, yet within a larger scheme.<br /><br /> Within this larger scheme, I can assert that this book is popular for a reason. In my own mind, that reason is valid. I am a sucker for some of the techniques used in it. On the other hand, I knew the story before finishing the first page. The sign of this book's largess is that the knowledge did not diminish the experience of the book itself for me. I would have preferred one character to have been further redeemed. I would have preferred this or that or the other, but it was not my novel to write. Yet, all novels become ours when we read them. Therefore I can say that John Green's novel was an enhancement. &#34;The Fault in our Stars&#34; enriched this reader, and I place a high value on being able to make that statement.on being able to make that statement.
B006ELF6AI|5|I started watching this show after it had been. on for a while so had to go back to the beginning and catch up. So glad I did. Yea Amazon Instant video!!!
B00KNWYDU8|5|Awsome game
B003VVFGWC|5|My wife and I agree this is, without doubt, one of the best series ever.  Kristen Bell is brilliant.  In fact most all of the actors are great.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I really enjoy this game!!!!! It's so fun and addicting. My 10 yr old loves it. Wish I could have more than five lives though. I hate it when I'm out of lives.
0345495004|3|I enjoyed this book because I did not know anything about Frank Lloyd Wright, except that he was an architect. This book puts you in his time period.  It was sad though, but I guess love stories can be sad.
B000P0J09M|5|&#34;What do I amuse you? What am I a  clown?&#34; ...yeah I enjoyed it :) won't stop quoting the movie
0810983915|3|The book had writing on the inside front and back covers.
B00LLMFAAG|5|Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5|It takes a lot of luck and skill to play this game, it's also great for the kids they love it as well... the lives kinda suck jus cause we seem to run out quick with all of us playing but all in all its a great game a must download
B005LAII9O|1|Oliver Stone is a relic.  One could not imagine such a poor script in an Oliver Stone film during his prime.  Indeed, 10 minutes of VO in the beginning of the film means both Stone and the script writers were too lazy to care about crafting their story. So why should we care enough to spend time to watch it?
B00W6XM002|4|Entertaining but gets difficult in a hurry.
B000FC1MOQ|5|Very interesting book from an addicts point of view.  I absolutely loved it.  It made me think and go inside myself.
B00AQF8CJ0|4|Small puzzle game, big fun! Well animated, and great design. Would highly encourage a download to try! Love the mumble of the jelly ;-)
B00JW2DDJM|5|Yes, I decided to get the box set. It is something unique and THAT recording method...We probably won't find another artist doing something in that nature. Old style packaging, with nice but thin booklet, DVD (fun and intimate insight of the recording process, with a very respectful and quiet Jack White), direct booth recording and standard recording on 2 LP's and 2 CD's. All topped with 7 cute singles on clear vinyl inside vintage sleeves.<br />It is NOT something for everybody's ear though. Even for someone used to Young and his down to earth music approach, it is a bit of a challenge to go through the songs. We are not used to that kind of sound quality anymore and the flow can, during some moments, be rather &#34;sleepy&#34;. But the whole idea to bring something so intimate and forgotten to our era and to present it in such a glorious state as this box set, is breath taking!<br />Highlights are without a doubt, Neil's lovely &#34;conversation&#34; with his mother, &#34;Changes&#34;, &#34;Girl from the North Country&#34; and &#34;Reason to Believe&#34; I didn't notice a big difference between the direct recording from the booth version and standard version on the CD's. As far as the vinyl versions go, I still have to listen to those. A beautiful chance to feel a time, that is far gone, much closer.
0240810961|5|Very pleased with our purchase of this book. Our grandaughter in South America found it most necessary and fundamental for her college studies. Thanks.
0740748475|5|Purchased for my son as a gift and he loved it!
B0000TB01Y|5|SAW IT IN HOUSTON ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, PLAN ON SEEING IT AGAIN THIS SUMMER,I LOVE THE TWIST ON THE WIZARD OF OZ!
B006GLLXXK|5|Not what I thought it would be. Not my usual show but I'm now on season 3. This show constantly throws me for a loop and is pretty weird, but none the less entertaining.
B00JH49OTS|1|I just finished watching this film and I don't really know quite what I sat through. There was hardly any real dialogue for a conversation between the people on the screen. It would've worked better for me if it were a short film. Not just confusing but definitely boring as well. Why Scarlett and not just any actress that can walk, talk, drive and stare? No big cheers for her with this one.
B0001ZX0OW|1|**Warning** Spoilers ahead.    How this pile of rubbish won so many awards is totally beyond me.  How it was rated at 87% on rotten tomatoes makes me question humanity.  First off, let's start with how bad of an actor Sean Penn is.  I just didn't buy any of his anger.  At the end when he finds out who the real killers are it doesn't phase him.  He never draws you in at all which makes you not really care that his daughter dies.  It doesn't help that she hardly has any screen time for us to care about her on a more direct level.  Next up is the stupid B plot of Kevin Bacon's estranged wife calling him and not speaking.  Really??  It added absolutely nothing other than being a sort of comic relief to the rest of what is going on.  Sean Penn's gangster friends also added to the camp factor.  Let's not forget the laughable monologue done by his wife at the end.  Next up is how the writer underestimates the viewers' intelligence with the incredibly weak attempt at portraying Tim Robbins' character as the killer.  Tim's wife in the movie was a one trick pony...quiver and grab at the neckline of her shirt.  At the end we find out the two detectives on the case who have left no stone unturned never listened to the 911 tape.  The worst part about the movie is that all the loose ends are tied up, and yet...the movie keeps chugging along!  If you eat dessert after a meal you don't go back for extra servings of the main course.  I would recommend watching this movie only if your life was at stake.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love the graphics in this game and how easy it is to figure out. They even helped me transfer my game to my new Kindle when my old one was damaged. Just wish many items didn't cost so many gems which take a while to earn.
B003F3FJQO|5|Awesome book. Well worth the read!
B00FN2KR2G|4|This novel is quick reading and has a surprise ending! I enjoyed the writing of this author. The book club I am in made an excellent choice in this book.
B00IK590UI|5|I never saw the original, and am not generally a sci-fi fan.  Joel Kinnaman's work in &#34;The Killing&#34; is what got me interested in the remake.  It was a fun movie, well done, well acted.  I plan to watch it again and view the original.
B004SD5GZ4|5|If you have a Kindle Fire and you're going to be reading .pdf's, then you're going to need this. Even if you're not going to be reading .pdf's, chances are you'll be browsing at some point and come across a webpage in .pdf format. Basically, it's essential.
B00006AW2P|5|First, a response to a very negative reviewer who said this album made his ears hurt:  It's called Rock & Roll, Junior!!!!  It's supposed to sound raw and impassioned.  Were you expecting something in the vein of Phil Collins or Seals & Crofts?  Yes, the Beatles were definitely the most innovative, prolific, and musically brilliant rock band to ever come from the United Kingdom, I'm certainly not debating that.  But as to which group ROCKED harder, longer, and with the most hip-swinging, soul-swaggering pathos, it's The Stones, hands down!!!  The Stones were NOT a duplicate of the Beatles, they are a total original.  I'd rather hear the Stones in '62 than the Beatles in the same year, when they were mostly doing bubblegum ditties and merseybeat ballads.  If it were the Beatles of \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", maybe it'd be a (slightly) harder decision.  This isn't to say that I don't love the Beatles, but they adapted to a rock style much later than the Stones, whose humble working-class upbringings in the dreary industrial sector of England gave them the hard-bitten cynicism and youthful angst to make hard-rock sentiments come as second-nature.  Having said that, I can not even begin to extoll this deliciously furious, infectiously catchy album enough.  This first album chronicles their love affair with 50's and 60's soul and R&B, and they pull it off in spades.  Even the Beatles could never do the music of early bluesmen and black rockers like Chuck Berry this much justice.  The Stones take music that was already brilliant, and make it even BETTER!  Could you ask for a more rollicking interpretation of \\"Can I Get a Witness?\\", or \\"Walkin' the Dog\\"?  This is the Stones at their roughest, most raw-edged, musically unbridled beginnings, and this album of covers, to me at least, is just as satisfying and revolutionary as the Stones' original work (which is an outstanding, enduringly phenomenal and still-growing ouvre in and of itself).  In closing, yes, these are covers, and yes, they are RAW as they come.  But that's Rock & Roll, baby!!!  So kick up the stereo and enjoy!!!
B00HV2KU5A|5|I am a high school teacher and was looking to find something clean.  This was requested by my third hour. They enjoyed singing along.
B0064X7FVE|5|Has been the most accurate weather app I have used.
0810970686|5|As a parent or a boy who doesn't like to read these books are wonderful.  My son would ask at least once a week when the new one would be out.  As soon as he got it he immediately sat down and started reading.  I hated to ask him to quit reading and go to sleep as normally I would be asking him to quit watching tv/playing video games and go to sleep.  He read it straight through the first day he got it and then read it again, just as he had done with the others in this series.  The only thing that could make it better is if there were just more of them.
B009NFHF0Q|5|Read straight through. A beautiful fairy tale for all ages. Lovely and haunting left me wanting more. 3 more words.
B00633W614|3|I found it a little boring at times, many times I felt like putting it down and going on to another story, but continued reading,
B00003CWL6|5|Characters need to be real. In Sam Mendes' \\"American Beauty\\", they are more real than some people in actual society at times. It's true that some of the characters are a bit exaggerated, but they all come from a deep truth that makes everyone of them entirely believable as being actual people. While the events and characters in this film seem like something that could never exist, in all actuality, everything in this film could be entirely real and that's what makes this is a great film. It's hard to say exactly what this film is about specifically, for there are many takes about what the film is truly about. For me, however, I like to say that, in a nutshell, the film is basically about Lester Burnham, played to perfection by Kevin Spacey,  and how his life isn't going so great, so he decides to turn things around for himself and in doing so, turns everyone else's lives upside down. I read a review that completely thought there was no reality in this film, and I feel he couldn't have been more wrong. There are two main elements that make this film so real in it's presentation. The characters and the locations, meaning what there was behind both of them. Everyone in this film is probably, in some way, like someone you know. Whether it be exaggerated a lot or a little, the people in this film are more real than even some of us are. Look at the Burnham`s. We have the workaholic wife, the rebellious teenager, and the mid-life crisis father. It may seem clich, but that's only on the surface. I bet there's a family out there, that you know personally, that fits this bill exactly. The point is, although these characters seem like something you've seen before, it's that reason right there that makes them so special. This feels like it can happen the way it is presented in the film and therefore it makes us care. The fact that there is at least one character for everyone in this film that they can entirely relate to makes this such a strong piece. Lester is my personal favorite. He's a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis. What does he do about? He tries to recapture his youth. He smokes pot, starts working out, and fantasizes about high school girls. As I read in another review, and I entirely agree with this, \\"This is the man we could all be one day. It's as depressing as it is beautiful.\\" This thought struck me hard and completely opened my eyes to how great Lester is. Lester is all of us, in some way, and therefore is able to take us to places we might have never been before, to see what may be or what may not. As far as location goes, nothing could have felt more real than what was portrayed in this film. It mainly took place in a suburban town, but the interesting thing is we never really see just how spaced out everything is. What's so lifelike about it is the main idea that, on the outside, everything looks right as rain, but underneath what meets the eye, there is a lot of strange things going on. Just to name a few: adultery, drugs, underage drinking, homosexuality, sex, invasion of privacy, and murder. The interesting thing about all of these is that they happen all the time in daily life right under our noses. What this film is can really be said as an inside look and what life can be. The way the film is presented makes this feel like it all actually happened, and that we are to believe all of these events actually occurred in a town that could have very well been the town that we are currently living in.In my mind, this film had very few, if any flaws. It felt like real life. Not entirely the life that we live in, but a variation on what could be. Once again, an exaggeration of what life may or may not be. I once had a teacher who had told me when she saw a movie and thought is was just a decent movie, she called it a \\"movie\\". However, when she saw a movie that was, to her, incredible, she referred to it as a \\"film\\". In case you missed it, to me \\"American Beauty\\" is a \\"film\\".
B009E2WX3W|5|This was a great tape when I got it 25 years ago.  I am so glad to have it again in remastered digital quality.
B001FB55LM|4|This is the funniest movie of the year. The combination of Jim and Zooey is fantastic. The scene with Danny Masterson and elderly neighbor is hilarious. I can't wait for DVD to come out. It's that good.If you looking for funny and entertaining. This is it.
B00687Q0VC|5|very well done
B000RG1FMO|3|I gave it 3 stars since some of the song's have good musical arrangments that West should only stick to since his rap skills are somewhat... I dunno, not too good. This album and 50 Cent's are nothing spectacular, atleast this is somewhat creative compared to this whole \\"gangsta\\" \\"thug\\" image mainstream rap music pocesses. Brainwashing this generation into a bunch of materalistic, consuming drones, which is sad. Soulja boy? T-Pain? Lil Boosie? Mainstream rap/hip hop music is in a state of denial.
B000I5X81A|4|Good collection of J.J. Cale and Eric Clapton singing Cale's songs. CD came right on time and was what I expected
B005ZMUXDC|5|Great movie, for kids and adults of all ages. Who knew frying pans were the ultimate weapon. My daughter has watched it so many times. I'm surprised she doesn't repeat it for me line by line. Great music and character voice overs draw you in, and the lighthearted comedy just makes you feel good about everything.
0385736002|4|Reading this book lead me to Scott's others in the series. Fantastic plot. It sets the stage beautifully for all that came afterward. For me it was a page turner. In reading this as a writer and then the following books, The Alchemist clearly showed how to lay a base that can explode in even better, later work. As somehow who has worked extensively with teens, I can see how they would be enthralled.
B00LCT48GA|5|Slash rips!!  Myles sounds fantastic and much better than the last Alter Bridge CD.  Fantastic backing musicians.
1451636016|4|I think Sam Harris' book opens up new questions to be asked:<br />If we are to accept our consciousness in the present with whatever its contents are, why do we strive to upgrade our future experiences. We all want to drive a nicer car, have granite countertops, and purchase the latest iphone. Surely Sam is making money off of this book and he appears to be well groomed. What is the relationship between the needs the mind wants and consciousness's ability to accept whatever is happening in the present moment?<br /><br />Also, if there is no self, are we just floating consciousness's attached to a mind and body that is part of some natural simulation? This would mean the choices that we make in life are not truly choices at all, but just chemical reactions in the brain that have been developed over time.
B003O86FMW|5|I absolutely loved this book. I was so shocked by how it turned out that I instantly had to start reading the next. TEAM PEETA :)
B00KF7VWBO|2|ITS JUST OKAY
B00C5R7B0I|5|Cromwell manages to write yet another good book that will keep you on the edge of your seat all while learning to love the characters a little more.!!
B00H2UFHBI|5|BOOK ONE: OUTVIEW: Two things are sure. This is one hell of a well written novel, and the author has done his homework on the subject matter. I will leave the longer and more detailed reviews to others as they are not my strong suit. Suffice to say you will enjoy both this author and his work. Grab a copy now. What the hell. Grab two.<br /><br />BOOK TWO: OUTIN: Brandt Legg is a tour de force. His work has a powerful New Age quality that packs a mighty punch and a professional quality that will floor you. His first book, Outview, was good. Outin is even better. Highly recommended.<br /><br />BOOK THREE: OUTMOVE: Nate is back for round 3 and it doesn't disappoint. This is a page turner that outdoes the first two books by Brandt Legg, Outin and Outview, and it continues the spiritual learning begun in those books in a highly entertaining way. Recommended for those on a spiritual path and those who like their sci-fi. 5 stars.
B00CEZJT2E|5|Ordered this for my wife who travels quite a bit. Has come in handy for her on the road many times. May pick up another one for myself (jealousy). It is about the same size as a phone so it slips easily into a bag or even pocket. The 4 white LEDs let you know how much power is left or how the re-charging is progressing if you plug it into the wall. The built in micro USB cable is brilliant. No need to carry around a charger, cable or any kind of adapter. Just a great product.
B00GT35G9C|5|One of the best season ones I have ever seen. From start to finish it is exciting, funny, dramatic, and has incredible characters to add to the overarching plot. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys solving mysteries with a sarcastic flare. Amazon offers great sound and picture quality as well - not to mention it is free with Amazon Prime!
B0095P33IW|5|Loved the movie!  Good family fun!  I love the separate movies and then putting them all together in the Avengers movie.  Must see for family movie night.  Worst part for small children is the people being shot and turning to dust.
B001S49AQW|5|This is just an excellent little romp. I absolutely adore Kitten and all of her scrapes, and this is just another reason why I love Georgette Heyer so much. I couldn't put it down and I recommend it to any Regency fan who is unfamiliar wirh Heyer, and Heyer fans alike. Great weekend reading in this wintry weather with a nice cup of cocoa!
B0000C9ZLD|5|&quot;Room on Fire&quot; has been vastly outsold since it's release by 50 Cent and Blink 182. It's just another chapter in the saga of the hype and backlash surrounding the band.<br />     But should you buy &quot;Room on Fire?&quot; The answer, if you like simple, melodic rock 'n roll, is yes. Don't listen to the hype surrounding the Strokes, because they have made it clear that they don't.<br />     The only thing more annoying than the Strokes hype is the Strokes anti-hype. Those people who hate the band and &quot;Room on Fire&quot; assume we think we are the coolest people in the world. But they're wrong. They hate the Strokes, therefore, they're just a little cooler than us.<br />     Congratulations.
B008SAZHLQ|4|SO many feels! A truly funny, sweet, and heartbreaking look at young love and the awkwardness and pains of adolescence. This book really does make you remember what it was like to fall in love for the first time and have your heart broken all over again. The perfect read for a lazy summer afternoon. Well done, Rainbow Rowell. Well done.

0439023521|5|I don't think I can add any information that hasn't already been said about Suzanne Collin's amazing book, but I just wanted to share that it's one of the best books I read in 2010. The plot and pacing are breathtaking, and the characters are well drawn and easy to care about. Perfect for teens, as well as adults (like me) who love YA.
1603427244|5|I love to learn new techniques and this book is easy to follow and full of new ways to cast on and bind off.  I have been knitting for over 40 years and it's always great to learn new ways to do things.  It makes knitting exciting again!

B00EL8I8IS|4|Different take on a zombie movie. It's got the right amount of suspense, drama, and comedy. Overall good movie!
B009GEBBNQ|4|I rented this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. One needs to watch it with a sense of humor. There is a great deal of violence and it is, therefore, not for small children. They might become upset. I found the joining of so many superheroes very entertaining.
B00G3L6KQI|5|I strongly second a previous reviewer's phrasing that this is a &#34;glorious ending&#34; to the the trilogy. Harkness masterfully handles wrapping up loose ends, the seamless integration of a wide range of characters introduced in the previous books (something so many people do badly), and keeps her characters true to themselves while still showing growth.<br /><br />The writing has the same feel as the previous two books, and I loved it immensely. Absolutely worth waiting for. This trilogy has been a fantastic read, and I hope the author continues to grace us with such wonderful work.<br /><br />Also, I am totally in agreement that Gallowglass needs his own book!!
0812589041|2|Like many of you out there I bought this book because of the amout of 5 star rating's it got. However, I believe that the reason why there are so many is because of the fact that most people surfing the net are of a young  age. The main theme in Ender's Game is that you should always stand up to  bullies and resent athoritiy. That is what Ender deals with time and time  again. He's tough and stands up for himself and the young reader's go wild.  If you have matured enough to not let bullies bother you anymore then you  have no reason to read this book because the rest of the story is just  average at best. Card is an easy writer, but not in a good way. He lack any  real creativity in his style. He just blurrs through things as if the  english language is a burden to the telling of his story. He lack elegance  or grace. Now I am not a great writer, but I know when I am reading one  like George Orwell for example. You can tell that Card really wanted to  tell this story and does so with passion and conviction. His later books  have had poor reviews because he does not have a burning story to tell. In  addition, his poor writing style makes his stories even less pleasurable to  read. Card does present an important issue in the end about the war, which  I have noticed many of you young reviews did not understand and felt it was  not related to the rest of the book. Probably because Ender was not  fighting bullies anymore.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Very entertaining!  Can't wait to see season 6!
B00DJFIMW6|5|excellent game very addicting. cannot stop playing. perfect for just sitting around with nothing else to do. I give this game two big thumbs up.
B00004U3UG|3|ARMY OF DARKNESS, IS BY FAR A CULT CLASSIC. BUT IT'S WAY TO DARK FOR DVD.  THE MOVIE ALONE IS AWESOME,BUT THE QUALITY OF THE FILM IS WAY TO POOR IN  SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE. I RECOMMEND THE REGULAR VERSION OF THIS FILM. THE  SOUND IS GOOD, BUT IT SHOUDL'VE BEEN MORE FOR DVD. IT SHOULD OF HAD THX, OR  DTS ATTACHED TO IT. I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS MOVIE, BUT NOW I THINK  I'LL TRADE IT IN FOR THE BASIC VERSION. ALL THE EXTRA'S WITH THE DVD, LIKE  THE ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE AND ALTERNATE ENDING IS A VERY GOOD ADDITION TO THIS  TITLE. IT'S NO, &quot;MATRIX OR INDEPENDENCE DAY AS FAR AS SOUND GOES. I  CAN SEE WHY THEY CUT ALL THE FOOTAGE OUT, IT WASN'T NEEDED AS FAR I CAN  SEE. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED,..RENT IT  FIRST AND THEN YOU DECIDE IF IT'S WORTH IT. IF YOU EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO  GET THE BASIC VERSION OF..ARMY OF DARKNESS. THANK YOU....
B004QZ9PLU|4|I enjoyed the book. It was a good romance that had some twists and turns I didn't see coming. I would have preferred a happier romantic ending but it was good.
0061251321|2|Very disappointing... this book was very superficial and lacked substance.      I read this book based on hearing Ken Wilbur interview the one of the authors, Dave Logan.  Ken Wilbur seemed to like the book and concepts and he recommended it, so I thought it would be a really compelling read.  But it was not.  Not even close.  (Now, I will adjust my Ken Wilbur credibility gage)    I kept hoping it would go somewhere and get interesting, but chapter after chapter, it did not.      One thing this book does have, is a whole lot of name dropping - Michael Jordon, Mike Eruzione, Carol Burnett among others.  And in a truly bizarre twist, they have numerous quotes from Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, and from an actor in the movie, Office Space. They seem to suggest that these two, a cartoonist that finds humor in dysfunctional business behavior, and an actor that played great model of what they were discussing, somehow lends credibility to their thesis.  It came of as really weak.     There are way to many good/ great business & culture books out there to pick this one.  Also, if you are looking for leadership books, again, there are way to many great ones to pick this one.      And finally, if you want a reference point to which books I think are great: Good to Great by Jim Collins is a great business book.  And for leadership, you should read Endurance, by Alfred Lansing.     You have been warned!
B00BWU0S3Q|5|Excellent!  I have already watch the video many, many times.  Look forward to watching it many more times.
B009HQ9UHC|4|Fun game, It is a kick off from the angry bird series. Personally I like angry bird better. But the kids play this game often.
B0000AUHPK|5|Irritated beyond belief after hearing that annoying Kate Bush song \\"Wuthering Heights\\", I thought I'd rather be shot in the kneecap with a .22 then actually watch the movie. I finally gave in when Ralph Fiennes made a toss at it.   Most people already know the story of Heathcliff; humiliated as a child, he gets even with his tormentors when he grows up and his revenge isn't so sweet, least of all Heathcliff. I'm just going to focus on Fiennes in this review. He is so hot, it's unbelievable. This is the film that put him in my NUMBER ONE CELEBRITY CRUSH position, a title he still holds to this day. The looks he gives, I guess some people would say he's overacting but noooooo, he isn't. He's just so super hot some people can't handle what a `true player for reals' he is. You should totally buy this movie. It's only like $1.00 used but if you do buy it, I swear to God you'll be crushing on Ralph just like me.   And he's a really good actor, which you can tell because if you just watch him you can feel every word he says. He was trained at RADA and it's obvious he's a skilled actor, especially when he's beating on someone or slapping some chick or throwing dishes around. Also, I read that the girl that played Cathy, Juliette Binoche, had no formal training and was discovered working at Boots. I'm sorry but it shows. She was obviously English trying to do a French accent trying to do an English accent and I was like, just be English, duh.  This version of Wuthering Heights is the best because that Kate Bush song is not in it at all and because they used Ralph Fiennes for Heathcliff. The Ryuichi Sakamoto song was very irritating, too. It made me want to hurt myself and others so now I put on `mute' until I know for sure that part is over.
0345529057|5|Epic fantasy that transports you to another world. Excellent author who leaves you wondering what will happen next, as no one is safe when you play the game of thrones.
0525953094|1|I have always said that Pillars of the Earth is the best book I have read. Well Edge of Eternity is now the worst. I am very disappointed in Ken Follett. Before I read this book I had no idea his political leanings. Now they are crystal clear. This book is a one sided, inaccurate, liberal essay. Everything good over the 30 year or so period covered in the book is the result of the Democrats. Everything wrong was caused by the Republicans. Actions taken against African Americans were always caused by Republicans. The Kennedy brothers could do no wrong, but Ronald Reagan had African Americans beaten up while governor of California and had absolutely nothing to do with bringing down the USSR. Interestingly, Mr Follett glossed over Jimmy Carter as it seems his rewriting of history even could not come up with anything good to say. Mr Follett seems to miss that John Kennedy did little for equality as he and his brother did not find it &#34;politically profitable&#34;.
B002C6K7N0|5|It is very hard for bands/artists to stand the test of time, no matter from what part of the musical spectrum. While there are many bands that never quite made it there are those that have been around going on 30/40 years and we sometimes wonder why are they still here? Megadeth, Dave Mustanes' brainchild is one of the powerhouses who refuses to fall into that hole. This act has gone through so many changes for the past 26 years for better and for worse. Still speck of truth can be said about Megadeth, they are not finished.<br /><br />'The World Needs A Hero' was only the begining of a whole new life for this godfather of thrash. Of course there are so many other things that fueled Mustane's fire, but he has been able to evolve with the music scene and the ever changing world. 'Endgame' is just as heavy as it is significant. One step higher than 'United Abominations' the musician ship is amazing and the songs are an exciting adreniline rush one after the other. Since 2000 Megadeth has been living in it's golden years they are harder and edgier than ever before. Endgame is a must have for any Megadeth fan both new and old and believe me when I say don't be fooled by this albums title. Thanks to this past decade Megadeth's run is far from over.

0316098337|4|SPOILER ALERT<br />My advice would be to ignore negative reviews, the ones I've read don't seem to have much literary merit. I agree that it was difficult to read in places because of the use of five-year-old language, although I disagree wholeheartedly as a mother and teacher with a master's degree in education that this is anything other than a \\"normal\\" child. It is not at all unusual, despite other reviews, for a child at that age to seem wise beyond their years at times and struggle with grammar at other times. The only other thing that bothered me was that Dora the Explorer would not be able to be viewed on an antenna. The author could have achieved the same plot purposes (the repetition of the steps of the escape) with another show on PBS. Those are the reasons for my giving the book 4 stars instead of 5. It's also true that the escape plan is a bit far-fetched, but there are plenty of stories of far-fetched plans working in real life for those escaping the Nazi's. (Read Night.)<br /><br />I found this book to be riveting and haunting. It made me look at my own son, who is adopted out of foster care, in a new light with greater patience and understanding.<br /><br />In response to those who are annoyed by the lack of the word the, I think you missed the point. Jack does use the word the most of the time, as in \\"the lolipop,\\" \\"the left one,\\" etc, but he refers to most of the objects in Room as proper nouns: Bed, Lamp, Table, Rug...I believe that the personification of these objects is because Jack considers them his friends. They meet his daily needs in a similar way that his Ma does, but his connection with her is much more intense and primal. I was not bothered at all by the breastfeeding as it allowed for a positive physical connection between the two and also would have provided much needed nourishment for him and a sense of purpose for his Ma. (Not only was she caring for her child, but remember the only other physical contact she had for 7 years was being raped and beaten by Old Nick.)It was not for birth control, there is a reference to her 28 pills in the package that looks like a spaceship, so I assume she was taking birth control pills. (Odd, admittedly, while breastfeeding)<br /><br />I disagree about the suicide attempt coming out of left field. I thought it was foreshadowed when she requested to be put in charge of her own medications and I found it completely believable that she would want to escape the world after knowing that Jack was safe in the hands of her own family.<br /><br />I think this book was very well-written and a poignant reminder for us to focus on the people around us who matter most and take time to consider the thoughts and feelings of our children from their perspective. Parts were disturbing and thought provoking, particularly thinking about what I would have done in the mother's shoes after the escape and when questions were brought up such as whether she should have let Old Nick drop him off at the hospital at birth.<br /><br />Whether you love it or hate it, this book will invoke a strong reaction from you, and that, in my opinion, is what makes it a true work of art.y Old Nick.)It was not for birth control, there is a reference to her 28 pills in the package that looks like a spaceship, so I assume she was taking birth control pills.

B0063IH60K|5|Great fun to pass the time away while waiting for doctor appointments and between traveling.  I highly recommend this app.
B0000025CP|5|For some reason this one never gets the credit or attention it deserves. This CD seemed to be the point at which everything seemed to gell for the Priest. Gone are the hippy meanderings that plagued parts of previous  releases, to be replaced by the band that most of us recognise today as a  mighty metal machine. First things first, the band was now writing  sc-fi/urban mythology themed songs to great effect, and the production on  this one stripped everything down to the bare bones leaving us with crystal  clear vocals and guitars. This sound surely must be what future titans such  as Metallic and Slayer would kill for. It complements the songs so  well...no clutter! This one also contains Rob's best or most consistant  vocal performance so far....warning: tape up ya windows cause they could  shatter! &quot;Exciter&quot; is the worlds first speed metal attempt, (read  awesome) even by todays standards, &quot;Invader&quot; with space ship  intro is corny as hell but try resisting, and the legendary for all the  wrong reasons &quot;Beyond The Realms of Death&quot;, which should be  acknowledged as a fantastic sci-fi/fantasy classic. Every song is built  upon  classic early British metal riffs, for example &quot;Saints In  Hell&quot; which could easily have been the Priests answer to fellow  legends Sabbath's Paranoid. Oh for the golden age of Heavy Metal, which are  two words that the mighty Priest have never failed to embrace as their own.  Start you're love affair here!
B008M36EEI|5|Did not know how this movie would be, but was pleasantly surprised! It had underlying themes to globalization and a reasoning to bring people together.

B000059XUP|5|The Crow: City of Angels is really a 4 star rating not a 5 but I am giving it that because the customer reviews were weak. I love the first Crow, It was a very dark adaptation of the comic which featured awesome acting and great action, and gory kills. The Crow: City of Angels was dismissed as a cash in right off the bat when it was announced, People thought it was a disgrace to the late Brandon Lee(R.I.P) which is understandable but City of Angels really is a good film. I have not seen The Crow: Salvation or The Crow: Wicked Prayer yet but I especially heard Wicked Prayer is the worst of the series.<br /><br />Plot: Ashe Corven(Vincent Perez) and his Son as they witness a gang murder a guy, The gang then kills Ashe and his son and Ashe gets resurrected by a crow and becomes The Crow to get revenge on the gang that killed him and his son. Sounds almost like the first one and the plot is near the first one but it is not the same. Iggy Pop gives a good performance as one of the gang members as well as a young Thomas Jane. Vincent Perez is good as well but of course not better than the great Brandon Lee. Mia Kirshner plays a older Sarah in the film and does a good job.<br /><br />DVD: Warning, Get the Collector Series DVD if you plan on buying City of Angels, Do not get the Miramax DVD released a couple of years ago or the Blu-Ray put out a couple years ago because the picture quality on the Collector Series DVD is better and it has a ton of features, The recent Miramax releases have no features.<br /><br />Overall: If you do not compare City of Angels to the first one, You may enjoy it. I love this film and I know I am in the minority of that but if you go into it with an open mind, I think you will appreciate being its own film.

B0002HTZJI|5|I've seen the Chili Peppers live twice, own all of their studio recordings, own both of their live concert DVDs, and several of their CD singles/imports.<br /><br />I think it's useful to compare Live in Hyde Park with Live at Slane Castle (even though Slane is a DVD), as both are from the same tour and have similar (though not identical) setlists.<br /><br />Slane is more polished, with more post-production.  I strongly suspect that Anthony Kiedis redid some of the vocals, because his singing is in tune far more on Slane than on Off the Map, Hyde Park, or in concert in person.  Some of the musical instruments may have been re-recorded, re-processed, or otherwise touched up.  All of this gives Slane the polished sound of a studio recording.  On top of this, I would say that the band plays more conservatively on Slane than they normally do, probably because they know a concert DVD is being filmed.<br /><br />In sharp contrast, Hyde Park seems less polished, more raw, and better captures the experience of seeing the Chili Peppers live.  Anthony's voice is not always perfectly in tune.  The mix is not always perfect.  But so what?  The energy just oozes out of your speakers, through your ears, and into your brain and your heart.  Also, the playing is less conservative and more adventurous, like when you see them live.<br /><br />I still think Slane is a worthwhile purchase.  I describe it as half-way between a live concert and a studio CD.  But if you want the next best thing to seeing the Chili Peppers live, get Hyde Park.<br /><br />My other comment about Hyde Park is that it overwhelmingly focuses on Californication and later work, with only two tunes from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and nothing earlier.  This shouldn't be surprising, because they just didn't play much of the old stuff at all during the entire tour.  If you strongly prefer the older stuff, you'll be disappointed with Hyde Park.  But if you like the newer stuff pretty well, I think you'll be very happy with Hyde Park, and recommend it strongly.strongly.

B00E3JGCHO|3|This concert is one of the highlights of 1970's music.  It is presented here, remixed and remastered, and with the songs in a different order.  Everything works beautifully, although there is no \\"new\\" music here...just the same as the deluxe Rock Of Ages set.  Where things break down completely, though, is with the packaging!  First, the iconic cover image of the Ages set has been replaced with a cheesy, computer enhanced image of The Band with a mocked up marquee behind them.  Second, the award winning essay in Ages by Rob Bowman has been replaced with a much shorter and totally less informative one.  Thirdly,  the two discs are stashed in cardboard sleeves, ensuring they will become scratched, if they are not already when you receive the set.  Fourth, glue that holds the cardboard disc envelopes together likely has gotten on the discs themselves during production, as with my copy.  Fifth,  the booklet is glued in the center portion of the open case, by just its paper back page.  This means it automatically sags under the weight of the booklet and will likely soon  tear out, as only two staples are holding the rest of the booklet to its flimsy back page.  Finally, the booklet is glued in the case crookedly which is totally obvious as the image on it is supposed to line up with the remainder of the image on the cardboard on which the booklet is glued.  What a mess!  And the insult is greater, as the music they have packaged in this careless way is so iconic!  Shame...

0470876417|5|This is a great book! I came across Osterwalder's work back when it was still an article/report in 2007 and it was already very insightful and useful then, but this book just takes his high quality work to a whole different level. I am so happy to have this book at just the right time. It's an excellent way to visualize the composition of the business and to put each department's and employee's contribution into context. This is especially beneficial for our company since it's distributed and it's harder to get a sense of oneness and individual purpose without a very well designed tool like the business model canvas.

B00003CXTG|2|I honestly did try to watch this movie at one point and just couldn't. It seemed like it dragged on forever and ever. I don't do the long synopsis of movies but I will say this. The story was supposed to revolve around these characters during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That much they got. But I didn't care about the characters, the development really stunk. I found myself rooting for the Japanese pilots, a la MST3K. Drivel doesn't even begin to cover it. The costuming was done well, and the props in the sets well selected, but that's about the only good thing I can say for this movie. Watch it once. This is a movie you'll either love or hate.
0143038583|2|I eagerly opened this book and plunged into a morass of words. How many does it take to complete a thought. Couldn't the author have read and applied Zinsser's book \\"On Writing Well\\" before tackling this meaty subject?      The content is right on, but the message was obscured by the prose. Too bad. I would have liked to have finished it, but by the time I read a complete sentence or paragraph, there so many modifiers and conditional phrases, I lost the main point. I found it boring because of that.    If someone edited this book, pulled out the content buried within and tightened his writing, Mr. Pollan could have made his point much better.

B00M7URUUE|4|I enjoyed the movie and Russell Crow's performance as a tormented Noah.  There were a few Biblical facts here and there, but for the most part it is a fantasy story.  If you are interested in separating truth from fiction, read the story in the Bible, the book of Genesis.  The drama, Garden of Eden seed, Methuselah character in general, and rock &#34;watchers&#34; were created in the mind of the writer for entertainment purposes. Animals coming 2 by 2 is true.. Evil guy &#34;stowaway&#34; on the Ark not factual.  I'm going back to read the story in the Bible again and suggest others do the same if they want the real story.

B009DH2PP4|3|I have been doing extract brewing for a year so the first few chapters were skipped over.  The next chapters<br />on water tweaking were beyond my pay grade.  I skipped through many chapters but picked up tips along<br />the way.  I believe I got my monies worth and will consider it a reference book in the future.<br /><br />I read the book on my new Kindle paperwhite, bad choice.  The tables were presented poorly and it did not<br />flow well.  It looked much better on my Ipad One and the paperback would be a much better reference book.
B000002C25|5|Still Listening to this CD nearly 2 years later.  Great, memorable tunes that are standing up to the test of time for me.  I'd say, with out a doubt, that if you're a rock fan who likes great melodies, this CD is a  definitive must-buy for your collection if you don't have it already...as a  matter of fact, even if you have it already, buy it again!!! It's that  good.  :)
B005USZYDU|4|Good young adult read. Maybe like 5th grade.
B00B2QG3K2|3|If you have their first 3 albums and liked them, pick this one up. There is still a distinct Paramore feel to the entire CD, the same that made me like the predecessors. What's changed is the sound. It feels less like you caught Hayley and the gang reading out of a journal and more like they've taken the time to prepare some poetry or short stories for you. Same source, different vibe. Also, there are funk and pop threads laced into the workings on several songs. In the end, it's an acceptable mix-up that won't hurt your ears at all. Just look at the band's history; how could we ever be surprised that they decided to try to be different this time around? And, if you're like me, you'll be a little anxious to see where they go from here. Or was that review a bit Paramore than you were expecting?
B008RZF1UO|5|Easily on the same wavelength as other bands like Symphony X and Nightwish  (both of which formed after this band, by the way), Kamelot have long-ago established themselves to be not only one of the spear-headers of the progressive-symphonic/power metal genre, but one of its premier leaders, as well. Their sound is a unique one, as the band layers the eleven songs on this, their tenth full-length studio effort, 2012's \\"Silverthorn,\\" in loads of strong, propulsive, and muscle-bound (yet always catchy) riffing, deftly forceful drum beats, and solid backing bass lines. And the tempos remain thoroughly energetic throughout, too, thus helping Kamelot to further the band's status as first-and-foremost a heavy one.<br /><br />As such, this sound is refreshing and original, but if one had to compare it to anybody else, then it would have to be Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Queensryche, and Metal Church. It is, again, a very heavy, crunchy, and confrontational affair, but one that is iced with just the right amount of atmospheric keyboards and soaring melodic vocals that help to keep the arrangements in check and from getting to out-of-control. The end result is an epically epic piece of symphonic power metal, and one that sounds remarkably rich, textured, dynamic, and well-rounded. It is hard (nearly impossible, even) to choose a highpoint, as the standouts are sure in abundance, here, and almost each and every one is as great (if not greater) than the one that preceded it.<br /><br />The album begins by getting all creepy on us with \\"Manus Del,\\" a heavily symphonic and ambient, neck hair-raising introductory piece, before diving head-first into heaviness with \\"Sacrimony (Angel Of Afterlife),\\" which backs a steady, meaty guitar chug with speedy double bass drumming and surprisingly thrashy tempo'ing. The tune does not completely forsake melody, though, as it does tuck in some wailing female backing vocals and a short but sweet, sweeping melodic guitar solo section for good measure. And immediately following it comes \\"Ashes To Ashes,\\" an even meaner, tighter, and heavier number with some more extremely cool and memorable melodic soloing. \\"Torn,\\" then, is a mildly thunderous and, naturally, very dramatic number with a juicy piece of fiery guitar crunch laid against a really cool-sounding operatic musical backdrop, and more wailing guitar leads.<br /><br />\\"Song For Jolee,\\" however, is the first piece of symphonic rock since the album began, and it is a beautiful and touching power ballad complete with a chilling piano line and some good, accomplished clean singing. And it flows right into \\"Veritas,\\" which finds a heavily symphonic intro giving way to brutal and commanding metal riffs and crunchy, pyrotechnic rhythms. The song does eventually come full-circle, though, as it gradually gives way to a gorgeously docile melodic breakdown (with twinkling piano keys and female vocals) in the outro. Some of the record's other best moments include the crunching metallic riffing and blistering, screaming guitar solo in \\"My Confession,\\" a piece of straight-up, Eighties-era power metal-tinged speed metal; and the title song, which bulges with brutal thrash riffage offset by beautiful clean vocals.<br /><br />But after extremely careful consideration and repeat listens, this reviewer has decided that \\"Prodigal Son,\\" a breathtakingly beautiful/orchestral, and gently-sung ballad, is probably the set's pinnacle. It would be a bit of a stretch to say that it upstages almost everything that came before it; but it does feature heavenly dual-vocal harmonization furthered by tastefully ambient keyboards, and epically soaring, melodic guitar leads. As good as its instrumentation is, though, it is actually the song's vocals, which are super, emphatically emotional (without ever being emo-ish), that take center-stage here. That is at least until, however, the song, an expansive and sprawlingly epic piece, gradually picks up speed and steadily gains undeniable bits of momentum, density, and heaviness.<br /><br />Heavy yet tuneful, more infectious than the Ebola virus, and filled with deliciously meticulous musical arrangements (and plenty of other good stuff), \\"Silverthorn\\" is not dragged down by even one single bad or even mediocre song. As such, you would be hard pressed to find a better pound-for-pound progressive-symphonic/power metal record on the market in 2012 than this one. It captures a band (Kamelot) at its absolute peak of excellence, and latches on to the listener's eardrums and memory bank from the beginning of its large-yet-accessible playing time (fifty-six and a half minutes), and never lets go.iness.

1594744769|5|It took a little bit to get into this book and I am not sure that I would have read it had it not been a book club pick, however, I really enjoyed it. It is easy to get invested in the characters. The Author does not hid any of the characters flaws. There is a believability issue but it was easy for me to get over since I love science fiction, magic and general weirdness.If you like historical fictions and mysteries this is a great book!
B00IMYZOBQ|4|This is a great movie, with outstanding performance by Sandra Bullock.  Too bad George Clooney was in it to mess it up
B000001Y79|5|This is one of my favourite albums of all time. The themes are consistent through-out the entire album, and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out. This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around.
B00AREIAI8|5|Totes get it
B000GT4H0Y|1|really bad, I've wanted to see this for years for some stupid reason.<br /><br />Don't be tempted like me.<br /><br />waste of time.
B0037VNX44|1|Pure rubbish!!! There is 2 hours of my life I can't take back. Whoever made this thought they were being artistic in the fashion of Clockwork Orange. Movie went on and on. No point. Just some guy who is pissed at the world. Well I'm sure there are many &#34;bronson's&#34; out there. Nothing special. I used to think Tom hardy was a good actor and now I see he is the same character in every movie. Outfits change but that's about it. Oh and another thing, Did we really have to see his &#34;stuff&#34; hanging out all the time? This movie is just ridiculous. I am so mad that others gave it high star rating. Please, Please, PLEASE, save yourselves from watching this.
B002T3A4KW|5|I've watched this movie several times and love it. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are perfect in it. It combines romance and comedy perfectly. Hugh's roommate is also hilarious! I enjoyed it so much I am considering purchasing it to keep in my library.
B00CDSVZHY|4|Lots of excitement with a bit of a political storyline.  Watch it and see the outcome, you may like it
B0086700CM|4|Its really addicting because of all the goals you can get. Its kinds hard to tilt but not to the point of where I don't enjoy the game. It is easier on the Apple iPhone or iPod touch because it is a lot smaller. I like it on the Kindle Fire tho too.

B00ACP3OOM|5|After seeing so many negative reviews I was a little hesitant to buy this product.. but I did since it was pretty much the only viable solution I could find to underwater headphones that didn't involve risking my $800 dollar iPhone getting wet. So far they work pretty darn well, music quality is a little poor but I wasn't expecting perfection. The quality definitely gets better when your head is completely submerged. Overall I am satisfied, makes swimming a lot more enjoyable!

B004132HZS|3|The BBC builds an impressive track record of movie achievements by taking a known story and contextualising in a different time or place. Examples include Wallander ( Swedish detective series with an English spoken dialogue) the Shakespeare retold series ( 4 key plays are conceived in  today's settings) and now Sherlock stays true to Conan Doyle's formulation inclusive of 221B Baker Street and arch enemy Moriarty but in the setting of contemporary London. This initial series comprises 3 episodes each of 90 minutes. The lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch plays Sherlock but could be mistaken as Dr. Who. The series is jolly good fun and the conclusion leaves the viewer wanting.

0060934913|5|I work as a sous chef in a three star restuarant(name withheld) in downtown Chicago, and let me just tell you that Tony knows what he's talking about. From the disgust of being demoted to cooking brunch to the fact that a fish special on Monday means you're eating at least five day old fish, Mr. Bourdain lets his reader into the sometimes scary glimpses of what professional kitchen life is really like. <BR>Mr. Bourdain also allows the non-professional to see what actually goes into cooking lunch for a hundred plus guest and then turning around and doing two hundred for dinner (don't forget they're different menus). The amount of prep and the realization that at one time or another you will be in the weeds, especially if your mise is out of sorts, is felt in this read. And though some want to romanticize about the Chef's life, Mr. Bourdain has been doing this for twenty-five years and he's still cutting his own shallots and doing inventory every week.<BR>Bourdain also takes a good look at the people who work in this industry. From the \\"actor\\" servers to the great line cooks from just south of the border(that's you, Juve), the amusing and different people you'll find are quite astonishing. The life is really for the people who could never do the nine to five but who aren't afraid to put in a twelve hour day. Bourdain describes us characters as sociopaths or anti-social, and he might just be right. The production that the kitchen goes through daily has to be ran by people who truly love food or just people who can make risotto taste the same way fifty times a day, otherwise it just won't work. Don't forget there's always the ever present barracho somewhere in upper managment. <BR>For anyone who is serious about getting into the industry, this book is worth while to see what you're getting yourself into. Did I mention that I've worked over forty hours the last three days, thirty hours split between Christmas Eve and Christmas day. It's the life and you either love it orhate it and Bourdain makes a strong commentary for both.<BR>The read is also very friendly and if you have a good reading spot it might only take one sitting.

B00QWUL4AW|1|Just like a lot of others are saying... it drifts from the Biblical story quite a bit. I was disappointed with how God was portrayed. The plague scenes gave a good feel for what it might have been like in Egypt but I didn't like how the film showed earthly explanations for most of the plagues.  It did inspire me to re-read the story of Moses in Exodus to refresh my memory of the details of what actually happened.  Would have been more epic in my opinion to re-film the 10 Commandments with modern special effects.
0060527986|5|The books in my personal library can be rated by the number of post it tabs. The more sticky notes, the better the book!  I find this a keep by the chair type book to read in bits and pieces as the mood strikes. It appears not to be a straight through reader. Read, absorb and move on until another day. And yes, lots of sticky notes have been placed in this book. It is just as described--short notes on accepting failure, embracing life, and rising to your destiny--if nothing else, it brings inquisitive thinking to the frontline. Take what you can relate to and leave the rest.
B005544TRQ|5|Entertaining!
0380729407|4|The title of this book is what initially drew me in. I always wondered where this phrase came from; little did I know it was actually a Shakespeare quote. Either way, I had never read a Ray Bradbury book before and I wanted an easy read that would be suspenseful and satisfying.<br /><br />The book follows the adventure of two young innocent boys and their run-in with an evil carnival that comes to town. I found the friendship between the two boys to be very similar to my childhood friendships, which helped me make a quick fun connection. The circus magic in this book seemed to me to have a little influence in the magical Harry Potter series, although not so deliberate in its fantasy.<br /><br />One of the most unique aspects of this book that I noticed was the usage of a mixture of concrete/abstract imagery to set the scene and describe the characters. When describing the dark figure coming into the room, Bradbury writes, \\"The shadow seemed deliberate in its slowness so as to shingle his flesh and cheesegrate his steadily willed calm.\\" With noun-verbs in descriptions such as \\"cheesegrate\\" and \\"shingle\\" it seems as though we can trace the tendency we have in American English of \\"noun-ing\\" our verbs back to Bradbury. At first, the very detailed and obscure descriptions were a little annoying and hard to read through. However, as I got used to the style of the author, I began to enjoy reading the different adjectives and verbs he would use to paint the picture in my mind.<br /><br />Overall, although a little hard to find initial interest, I found this book to be an interesting and beneficial read. The characters that are brought life in vivid abstract-concrete detail provides for a creative story with enough suspense and emotion to keep you interested until this end of this short read.
B00846REIS|4|At first it caught my attention but as I read more and more into the story I became more and more disappointed. There was so many similarities between the two it threw me off my interest. I wish I would of read these books before the fifty trilogy.
B0059R5Q08|2|I wanted to like it. Really wanted to like it. The casting was great; it was shot on location; they actually had MOORS instead of forests. I wanted to like it.<br /><br />I didn't. The original novel is drenched in red, flames, religious fervor, hysterics, and a simmering sexual tension, with a hint of the paranormal. This movie was not drenched in anything. It quietly told a boring story of a governess who was two-timed. Nobody really emoted. Jane twitched her eyebrow every so often. Rochester's lip trembled. St. John raised his voice. Bertha spat on Jane (trust me, one of the most exciting things that happened).<br /><br />And then, after dragging us through two hours of more boring than watching paint dry, they wrap the end in approximately 30 seconds of screen time. What took Charlotte Bronte 3 chapters to cover got 10 seconds. Seriously?<br /><br />Can I have my two hours back, please?
B000MZHW40|5|No doubt diamonds have been smuggled out of Africa at a deadly cost.  No doubt many African nations have been torn asunder by civil war.  No doubt there have been horrendous atrocities.  And no doubt preteen boys have been literally snatched from the arms of their parents and turned into ruthless killers.  But when a movie, BLOOD DIAMOND, depicts all of the above in such a brutal, graphic nature, the question is begged:  Is it really that bad over there. . .or, perhaps, has there been a little embellishment?<br /><br />But I digress.  Whether the quest for a 'Mother Lode' diamond in war-torn Sierra Leone is slightly exaggerated in terms of its gratuitous, mind-numbing violence, the fact remains this movie is pause-everything-else-in-your-life riveting.  When a filmmaker has completely and unequivocally drawn in his viewer--makes the viewer forget about everything else other than what he/she is watching on the screen--then cinema magic has been captured in a can.  So kudos to the always-innovative Edward Zwick:  His astonishing, gasping scenes had me flinching and weaving and jumping so much the springs in my recliner are creaking.  By the time the credits were rolling I felt mentally and physically drained--and grandly entertained.<br /><br />As the lead (a former mercenary turned diamond smuggler with a heart of gold), Leonardo DiCaprio continues to surprise.  For the longest time he was an annoying scarecrow; now he's morphing into an accomplished thespian right before our eyes.  I really enjoyed his Rhodesian accent (or whatever they're calling Rhodesia these days).  And has Djimon Hounsou ever been lousy in a movie?  Absolutely not, and his portrayal of a fisherman trying to find and salvage his family is certainly no exception.  Jennifer Connelly looks good--even after a couple of nights in the jungle.  The on-screen tension between herself and Leo is fun to watch.  In fact, BLOOD DIAMOND, even if all the chaos and blood lust is a tad over the top, is fun to watch.  And if not fun, riveting works just fine.  Five 14-karat gold stars.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]fun, riveting works just fine.  Five 14-karat gold stars.  --D.

B002KQ6BT6|5|While reading this book. I would pause to look up events and symbols from the book. I had some knowledge of the symbols so was able to solve some of th clues. Over all this book is amazingly written. The stunningness of some of the events and facts that actually were real kept me reading. This is probably my new favorite book.
B003NWS5AO|4|Before Robert Plant had even met Jimmy Page and formed Led Zeppelin, Plant was in a group named Band of Joy. By titling his newest solo release after his former band, Plant hints at a return to his roots; bringing his fans back to where he got his start and pulling from his earliest of influences.<br /><br />With the exception of needing to drop the keys down a few half steps, Robert Plant sounds exactly the same as he did during the golden years of Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />Picking up where he left off with Alison Krauss and Raising Sand, Band of Joy opens with Los Lobos' \\"Angel Dance,\\" transformed into an Americana folk melody. The following track, Richard Thompson's \\"House of Cards,\\" slows the tempo and introduces Patty Griffin's harmonization while maintaining enough similarities in style to blend perfectly with the surrounding songs on the album.<br /><br />Band of Joy may be a collection of covers with only one exception, but every song feels uniquely Plant's.<br /><br />Produced alongside Buddy Miller, slow ballads like \\"Silver Rider\\" cleverly find common ground with the upbeat rock style of \\"You Can't Buy My Love.\\" While Plant's work with Alison Krauss broke new ground, Band of Joy re-tills classic tracks, turning his roots into a beautiful new garden.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Joni Mitchell, Neil Young<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Angel Dance\\"

0676786634|5|I'd have to say that after reading all the ambigouosly worded quotations on the back of the book, I was apprehensive when picking up The Golden Compass, the first book in the trilogy.  As with every book, it was adorned with advance praise, which is a nice way of saying &quot;we think you'll like it and I have to go spend the money I got for recomending it to you.&quot;  Still, Pullman was a good author, and so I bought it, and I very much enjoyed it.  I was young (9 or 10, I believe) when I read the first book, and I enjoyed it simply for what was on the surface.  I did the same with The Subtle Knife, and after going to the publisher's site this summer (Randomhouse), I noticed that the third book was coming soon.  I went back and reread the other two books (in two days, no less), and I thouroughly enjoyed them, and moreso, considering that I'd read Paradise Lost on my own time.  After reading The Amber Spyglass, I must say, it is a worthy conclusion to this trilogy, deftly avoiding predictability at every turn, and finishing with a profound truth about life and sacrifice.  Pullamn has kept me enthralled all the way through, and I cannot think of a better, deeper, and more epic story.
B00COGZ8FU|3|Not too much to say about this movie except for the ending which was far fetch too.  Tom always has a new car in his movies now because he likes racing but he need to get over it.
B00BHHIWQO|5|I LOVE this game. It keeps me occupied for hours! - well, once I have enough lives. Very simple concept, but you'd be surprised how addictive it can be.
B000YJ54DU|5|Reacher is the coolest dude going.  If you like solving mysteries these books are for you.  Also, if you like the good guy to win these books are for you.  Lee Child is very good evolving this character.  All the things that I don't like about Jack, like his inability to have a lasting relationship and putting down roots, are what makes him who he is.  I would recommend Lee Childs books if you like some well deserved violence and adventures that cover the United States.  I really enjoy his books, they are very entertaining and I can't wait to read the next one in sequence(because that's just my anal way).

The characters, the locations, the web of the story, simply keep you reading.  Once I finish the book, I immediately check to see when his next book is going to be released!  His tales of intrigue will keep you glued to your seat!  Enjoy the works of David Baldacci!

B0013DC5B0|4|This album is just silly. It's not their greatest, but it's good for the occasional listen and laugh. If you haven't seen the movie you probably should because it will make the album better to listen to.
B009CPES4I|5|Brilliant actors; brilliant  writing.
B002MQYOFW|4|I enjoyed the story overall. Exploring what war can do to a person, especially when your young, gives food for thought; even though it can be very disturbing to contemplate what human beings are capable of doing to one another.<br />On the one hand I can understand the fast pace and development of the story, but on the other hand I found the details of the characters' growths and convictions a little lacking because the story moved so fast. I was left at the end (of the trilogy) with a feeling of incompleteness, like I've missed something, only it wasn't there to go back and find. The whole thing was over in a flurry of action and I'm not sure I was completely convinced about the chain of reactions that brought it about. But this is just me, and I was still hooked and couldn't wait to turn each page to find out how Katniss will escape from the string of neverending impossible situations. I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of epic fiction.
B00KFWEWZ2|5|When this show first started I thought it was a bit slow moving and I wasn't sure where they were going with it.

The acting is outstanding.
B000006MS3|5|When listening to &quot;The Dreaming&quot; it is apparent that Kate Bush  had certain influences in making the record (The Beatles' psychedelic era,  Syd Barrett, Peter Gabriel's third album), but somehow the synthesis of  elements, added to Bush's own unique character, created a witch's brew far  more potent than any of the ingredients.  There is nothing like &quot;The  Dreaming&quot; in rock music, an album which demands to be digested on all  levels: intellectual, emotional,  psychic and spiritual.  The increasingly  arty aspirations of her work, which had blossomed on &quot;Never For  Ever&quot;, reach true fruition here.  The musical tapesty is dense, harsh  and thick, with the songs constructed around layers of sound and varying  styles (music hall to irish folk to tribal chants to modern electronica,  sometimes mixing them for full effect) more experimental than anything  anyone else was doing at the time; the impression was that she had gone  mad, and when  listening to songs like &quot;Leave It Open&quot; and  &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;, that is not so hard to believe.  It is a  brilliant madness, however, one that touches on topics and feelings usually  alien to most people, but which form the basis of our primal subconscious  thoughts (the album's only precedent had been Peter Gabriel's third, but  even that sounds tame compared to what we have here): lyrical topics range  from bank robberies (&quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;) to seances  (&quot;Houdini&quot;) to aboriginies (the title track) to rape (&quot;Get  Out Of My House&quot;), and Bush plows through them all with her wizard's  robe on, investing each line with all kinds of secret codes and confessions  which take the bedazzled listener dozens upon dozens of listens to  decipher.  Each track plays like a mini-film, with Bush's supremely bizarre  vocals exagerrated to levels (again) never heard of in rock; she can move  from soothing pop diva to screaming banshee with the batting of an eyelid.The harsh musical textures and shrill vocal sounds no doubt turned a lot of  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; listeners cold when released back in '82;  however, for those willing to listen, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is not only  her finest work, but the finest art-pop statement of all time.

B0088W7VNG|5|Awesome series. Watched all ten seasons and enjoyed every one of them.
B004LP3AYI|5|I'm reading this book set for the second time and have thoroughly enjoyed this book twice. Since the series is so long, it's hard for me to keep up with what's happened. Reading it a second time I was surprised once again with all the things going on. A truly thrilling book set I plan to keep.
B005EHQGTS|1|I tried to make this app work, but didn't get it to do what it is supposed to. I have only tried once and will find time to try again later. Setup seems a bit hard to understand.
0761119752|5|Best book to read to a child before bed. I love the fun rhyme and silly theme to this book.  I made motions to a few pages and the illustrations are perfect for the story.  I absolutely love this book and it will be a forever story in our household.  I give this as a gift to friends  and family who have children.
B00794ML3Y|5|I'm nearly through the first season of &#34;In Treatment&#34; as of this writing after taking it in small doses, a show at a time every several days vs. blowing through a whole season in a day or two of binge watching. There's an almost claustrophobic quality to the show, each episode but one of which is a psychotherapy session set in the private office of the therapist around which the show revolves. The emotional charge of these exchanges in this relatively tight space, made all the more so by frequent close-ups on the actors, is a testament to the talent of those actors and of the writers of this show, but also lends it that closed-in, quality mentioned above. The most interesting and emotionally true pattern in these episodes is the lengths people will go to create and maintain self-deceiving thinking and behaviors on one hand, then run away from their own truth without looking back when their systems of self-deception collapse. This seems to be the message in &#34;In Treatment,&#34; and it is one that's well worth hearing.

B0000CEB4V|5|A year after george harrison died, his friend eric clapton assembled a host of musicians for a evening tribute to his late friend.    george harrison's indian/hindu connections are on display with the show opening to the reverbation of vedic chants. sitar maestro ravi shankar shares the opening address with eric clapton in a moving show of affection for \\"his son\\" harrison. his daughter anoushka begins the concert with a sitar piece dedicated to the memory of harrison. it is followed by another indian set (with vishva mohan bhatt of indian slide guitar fame being part of the indian group). eric clapton joins in with some tasteful acoustic soloing at the end of the set.     harrison's travelling wilburys bandmate jeff lyne (of ELO fame) sings most of the songs which follow. it is a wise choice and most of harrison's compositions go very well with lyne's smooth nasal vocals. From then on it is a star parade with one star friend after another trooping in to perform their favorite harrison number : clapton's emotional delivery of 'if i needed someone', gary brooker's 'old brown shoe', jools holland's rousing 'horse to the water', billy preston's soulful 'my sweet lord', tom petty's 'tax man' and the travelling wilburys number 'handle with care', joe brown's 'here comes the sun', ringo starr's 'photograph', paul mccartney's 'while my guitar ...' (clapton does NOT replicate the solo as in the studio version).    paul mccartney tries a funky 'something' which is dreadful to say the least, where clapton steps in to the rescue (after all harrison's song was directed at his then wife patti boyd, who was also clapton's 'layla') and winds it up well. the assembled musicians also play other notable harrison compositions like \\"beware of darkness\\", \\"all things must pass\\" etc.    it is a pity that the camera man can only show clapton playing rhythm, when most of the (slide) guitar parts are played beautifully by marc mann of ELO who stands in the background. that's the only negativehere.    it is a great show - once in a lifetime offering ...    GET IT!
B00BIK3FAI|5|very engaging. my daughter likes the story and finding the stars along the way. my three year old son also likes the interaction

9113020730|5|About the only thing wrong with this third and final chapter of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is knowing that there's no book four, this owing to Mr. Larsson's untimely and early death.  Supposedly, the author had an early draft of a fourth book and had sketched out a ten-book series.  The movies will have to do for now.<br /><br />Larsson's Lisbeth Salander is a singular creation.  His creation of her world - as well as that of Mikael Blomkvist's - is laden with rich, fascinating detail that smells of the stuff of real-life.  Of particular note is Larsson's fine-grained take on hacking - Lisbeth's hidden talent.  The Trilogy's appeal lies to a great extent in Larsson's pitch-perfect take on the hacker life, both in his capturing of the details of the work as well as his ear for the culture and his depiction of its denizens.<br /><br />Part 3 of the Trilogy - Hornets' Nest - distinguishes itself from the other two volumes by its strong indictment of the Swedish Secret Service, aka the S&auml;po.  Yes, this is a work of fiction, but I imagine that the tale Larsson spins here would make a small number of people uncomfortable.<br /><br />In the US, we now have to wait for subtitled versions of the movies to make it here to these shores.  The filmmakers made the excellent decision to go full-out Lord of the Rings-style and produce film adaptations of all the volumes in one go.  Thumbs up for the selection of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth.  From the trailers, she seems an inspired choice.
