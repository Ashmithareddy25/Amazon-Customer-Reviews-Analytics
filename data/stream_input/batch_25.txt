B001GH5P3S|5|Great addition to my jeep
B000A6TIFM|5|A+ great
B000KL3DLC|5|Hands down the best floor liners out there. This was purchased for my 2013 Tacoma double cab. Fits perfect and easy to remove and clean. High sides to keep water and debris in. If you have a lease or just care to keep the original floors and mats in perfect condition, this is what you are looking for.
B00FT101VS|5|Worked Fantastic!
B000VLD744|5|This was exactly what I was after. It fit perfectly with no hassle. Snaped my bikini top on it and put it on. Great product.
B002QGVW3K|5|Perfect fit, unbeatable price, fast delivery. I am very happy.
B006XMI1M8|5|Product great, ...what Kia charges to to program is outrageous. ......
B000MD4YKM|4|works very well, should hold up ok. seems to be made well enough
B00SS15BH0|5|Great for my trips!!
B00TJAHZSW|5|best degreaser i have ever used.  works great with the chain pig!
B004RI67AS|2|I like the flag, but the holes for the hitch pin did not align at all with my very standard hitch and had to drill them out to make it fit.
B00CX8MHWG|5|They look great on my Outback and will protect the fog lenses very well. Installation was more difficult than I thought and I never could get all of the bubbles out, but from more than 5 feet away, they look good.
B000BZXR6I|5|Veryyy goood product !! A+++ shipping is on time  very nice will buy again THANKYOU!!
B00O6W970C|5|Very Beautiful. The picture says it all
B00N3HXVH6|1|Before I bought this product I was concerned about its size size, I even contacted the manufacturer, but without any answer. The picture is misleading because it is folded in halves, which seems to be longer without a dimension stated. Actually the size of the product is !7&#34;X 17&#34; the price is $19.99.<br />I.m not satisfied with this product, then I ordered the summer cool bamboo  pad also from Amazon, it's only half the price with a much better quatily.
B003P64XU4|4|these things work great , the only issue I have had is loosing the top probable due to high winds (twice). I just noticed that I am missing another one after replacing it 5 months ago. I will get another because they work great .
B0050HGZC0|4|Thought that it would have been helpful to include an option for multiple hooks. It is actually quite expensive to purchase that second hook. It should be part of every order. How many hooks are needed. And yes, I would pay something more.
B000CPCBF0|5|Love the smell of that 75 weight oil! Been running this in my truck since day one, wouldn't have it any other way
B0073WEZU4|5|Awsome product, fits great. Ill order from CravenSpeed again
B001RJOP5Y|5|This is a good quality product. It works exactly the way it is supposed to. The charge controller is an addition that is well worth the extra cost.
B000C9M4BM|5|Came as described
B002MESU54|5|Delivered when promised. the product is well made and fit just fine.  I am not handy but I followed instructions on utube and had them installed in two hours.  Definitely would recommend product.
B0001L0DFA|5|Liked it so much, this is the second one after having the same one for the year. It was dropped on the concrete floor  many times, no problem whatsoever.
B003CR2ILM|5|Looks awesome, sounds great, installs easy, improved my vroom. Can't ask for more.
B00EMKAINI|5|Excellent value - matched perfect
B00GX4Y9AY|5|I LOVE this charger!!! Use it to charge several phones every day. I even used it to jump my daughter's car after she left her lights on. Too cool!
B00HQC1W3E|5|NOT difficult to install at all!! Remove the plastic core support cover (simple plastic push pins), remove four 10mm bolts, tilt grille forward to access back side of factory mounted emblem bend (or break) emblem tabs to remove & bolt the new one in place. This emblem is a huge upgrade to the front of the truck. Removed the LTZ badge from grille too for a nice clean &#34;custom&#34; look.
B00I0H28F0|5|First off I messed up and had them sent to my old address but they fixed MY screw up and shipped them to me promptly. These seat covers are tough, they can hold up to everything me and my Land Rover can dish out and super easy to install. Their customer service is the best!
B000C9FDZG|5|Perfect and prompt!  Just what I needed
B00BLVK2ZA|5|Excellent product. Easy to install.
B00OCAICC2|5|Fits perfectly in my 07 B7 A4
B0054RW1HE|3|I had to modify the mounting bracket because it wouldn't allow me to remove and install my doors on my 99 tj
B00G6KXFLE|5|Good fit and good price. How can you beat free shipping to your front door?
B000NE7TJ8|5|Thank you for the great customers service,and great product.<br />Brian livesay
B00CLSWXRC|5|Actuall heat resistant unlike the Camco version.
B0051TPJKG|5|Nice to have in the house
B000CHLI02|5|I was pleased with the product and the fast shipping
B00IMVK08G|3|It dose not fit to my Subaru Legacy 2012
B007NGB3FK|5|Excellent quality.  Sizing accurate!  Thank you
B00JAMYDFC|2|I read many reviews and I thought I was getting something really great when I ordered the 32 ounce spray bottle and a gallon jug of the this cleaner. I was delighted to received it before I went on vacation so I could take it with to clean the mess the bugs made on our travel trailer vinyl  awning. I very sorry to say this product did not clean the mess the bugs made on the awning. Hopefully I will find something that this product will clean.
B00BRHM8FA|5|Does exactly what it says it does.  Really easy to use.
B00C43BOTM|5|Great product
B011JCD47I|5|I bought these to install in an uninterrupted Power Supply for my computers.  The arrived quickly and have functioned properly.  A good deal.
B00TYT9DEC|2|They don't seem to stick on, even with the adhesive.
B0049GHUYK|5|Great fit excellent quality nice price
B002PYBZJO|4|It was delivered fast.<br />I hooked it up to my car and it read codes, I/M readiness, and Oxygen Sensor Voltages that helped me find a slow O2 Sensor.<br />The values don't update with realtime frequency but enough to troubleshoot some issues.<br /><br />Definitely Worth the money just to read codes/clear codes, I/M readiness for emission testing, and some troubleshooting capabilities or just a cool tool to hook up to your car and monitor gas mileage and other measurements.
B009GK64Y6|2|Spend your $ on a higher quality product. You get what you pay for. I got mine in Feb.2015 and within a month noticed some condensation forming on the inside. I kept it through the summer, hoping maybe heat/sun would evaporate some of the moisture, but it's only managed to get way worse. Not only is there condensation in this light bar, there are small BUGS inside it too! Don't waste your $. Pro-it's super bright. Con-it's super crappy quality.
B00HJ158XW|4|Nice
B000JV4XEO|5|The 19.5&#34; Stainless Steel Wheel Simulators purchased for our motor home are perfect!
B00EK5DD6Y|5|goes great with my new billet grille and clear headlights with clear corner lights
B000ALBYZO|2|If you have an older car, you should buy the next size up. My 1964 Dart is 196 inches long. The 200 inch version of this car cover is 2 feet short of comfortably covering the car.
B000ENN9KG|5|I swear by this stuff. I haven't found anything that lasts as long and looks as good without getting too sticky. It is a little tougher to apply but worth it when the shine stays longer. It even comes with an application pad.
B001FAK4B4|2|if you install them with the washer as stated, it will start to cut the handle where it attaches.  I ended up taking these off and putting them on the headrest.  I got the grab handles that wrap around the roll bar.  Would not recommend these to  install with the washer and bold for rear passengers.
B00335LYHW|4|Cut is not as exact as could be, have to paint a few corners black so the lens does not show, but looks awesome when finished.
B000C7U08I|5|Perfect Fit
B00L32L4A4|5|I was a little apprehensive about ordering this cover, as I had not heard of the brand. I was very happy I did when it arrived.  The cover is very well made and fits perfectly. It also comes with 2 pieces of adhesive foam to seal out moisture in the front and rear of the bed, a magnetic led light and a storage cover. And at a great price. The money i saved buying this cover allowed me to be able to purchase some other accessories for my truck.
B000C5SEPQ|5|fits great
B00KBZON0C|5|nice Handles,didn,t come with gaskets
B005H53BSQ|5|Perfect
B000AMGYNA|1|Worthless.  Drain cap will not tighten without breaking.
B000F5HUTO|4|Great tool, nice and sturdy.  Used the hammering handle and gave it a couple of hard whacks with a 3 lb sledge.  Knocked the tie rod ends loose easily and had zero deflection or mushrooming on the handle.  Much more stout than my individual pickle forks.  Great set for the price!
B0000AYZBD|5|Was able to apply this purchase for a needed repair. This purchase saved me from a more expensive complete replacement.
B00QSNZJGI|5|On time and just what I wanted.  Good price.
B004BCJEBO|5|I put these headlights on my 2005 Toyota Sequoia, they are a perfect fit and took no more then 10 mins.  I reviewed an installation video I found on YouTube for a 2001/2004 Sequoia. The only difference was the '04 has an extra bolt. After I installed them I went to my local Toyota dealer to have them adjusted. I asked the Toyota Tech if it adjusted ok, he told me they were identical to OEM.<br /><br />I highly recommend and would purchase again.
B003TTL0TE|5|I thought that this product looked stupid, wouldn't work well, and would scratch my car. But it has so many good reviews that I had to try it. It is by far the best wash mitt I have ever used. It holds water and soap, works great with a grit guard, and it is made of some quality materials. Get this now if you don't like your wash mitt, or need a new one.
B005JWEY5G|1|slides right off wheel while driving
B004N026W8|5|looks & works great
B002P8HJ0E|4|Works great!
B0058SQP9E|4|It's what I needed, with one exception .... there was not a fastener pkg. included.  Other than that I'm satified.
B00BQC7JNW|4|Bought this for my 2011 sonata. Just needed something to protect it. Had to slit hole for trigger but it's in and protecting it! It has stick shift numbers on it. I don't mind I just wanted to protect my handle.
B0068FYOAS|5|Fast shipping like the seat
B001BY43SY|5|Makes your ATV look new
B000F13HRM|5|It fit great thanks
B00108CTWS|2|unfortunately did not fit my car and I had to return it
B000QFVJC2|4|product came in kind of a huge box, unwound and unbent, the box was about 6x6x36 those are off the top of my head, might be larger, but it came quickly, looked great, worked great, unfortunatly the yamaha carb i bought on ebay turned out to be counterfit and it had different threads than the stock, as well it came with female thread instead of male, so this cable has female and the carb had female with a different thread pitch so i couldnt just get an adapter, was kind of dead in the water after that.
B004VRLGU6|5|Smells good
B00DUUIQT4|5|Fits well. Very comfortable.
B008WHNHO4|5|Looks great installed
B000AL8VD2|5|Good price
B00QUSVN6G|5|They fit like a glove and we love them.
B000X9EGFS|5|Very well made
B00KUL73DG|5|fits. Works.
B001C6NC7O|5|Light Weight .....Love it
B00VV8IA2A|4|Works great on my 1995 Bronco!
B000VVSRKI|5|Love it!!!!!!
B00HR26XZU|5|Fast shipping and good price it all worked out good.
B008GVRI50|5|You can't buy a better valve core tool.  It works perfectly for vac'ing and valving off your vac to see where you're at too.  Best bet is to remove the valve core while you're at it.  It will vac faster.  Rated to 20 microns is pretty hardcore.
B00LHUI4XM|4|As advertised. Looks solid. Nice that screws and caps included
B00AN5UY3A|5|High quality brake parts, great price.
B00361QXJW|5|I am a Big Rig Technician when you have exhaust manifold bolts, turbo bolts, etc that are rusted to hell an back this stuff works. It takes about 20 mins but, it works. The silicone left behind helps prevent rust from stick and seizing bolt on its way out. It is also advertised taht it penetrates to 1 millionth of an inch. It just works when the major brand penetrating oils won't.
B0050ISA1S|5|Works great. Unlike previous comment I got the right one. Bright enough to be seen and turn signals standout. Shipping was fast. And it was plug and play.
B00OPMIR2M|5|Easy to use, accurate, great size.
B005FPAV2W|2|shipped fast but the tape is very thin even after I prepped the area I still ended up losing one on the highway because the tape didn't hold
B00VUH7ZR8|5|fast ship , very bright
B00UHD4HJA|5|👍🏻
B0002MB80C|5|Bulky feel until you get used to it.  fits great, installation was as denoted.  Very nice qaulity and feel.
B00IFMOVE6|4|I have had but pain driving  to much. So I ordered my beated padding, & enjoyed a 4000 mile trip. It worked perfect
B0016H0O6G|4|Lights all seem decent, mounted up to the trailer just fine. Wires all worked, but definitely seem like lower quality. For the price, I'm happy with it.
B00G6IMXSC|3|Didn't need it but good product
B00LT0ELKA|5|They are even longer than the other ones I had, and my feet are huge. Very happy with them.
B0057YHQGK|5|I love it!!! Just as described! Thank you.
B00INZ65B2|5|I only replaced the one motor that was failing and will keep the rest for potential need later.
B007T12Q2I|5|Made my truck looks super cool in that it was. A replacement for a broken one but very fast shipping and reasonable price<br />*RuDe BoY J'maica*
B00CQ40KVM|5|Well made durable mats.  Pleased.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Very easy to program
B009PIIS9I|2|It is not about product quality. Plastics resistance and general design are quite well. These guards has two problems: they are long and constantly hit the floor when my Ford Escape crosses road bumps with an annoying noise so, secondly, they finally tore up the fender's screw anchorages.<br />I don't know if an inch less than the current length can solve this, but in a vehicle that supposedly can face any road defect, this feature makes the guards a bad choice.
B001GJ3DZS|5|I have 6 regrestered autos I refuse to pay a detailer to spray armoural over dust & smear it & leave spots on my finish and glass. These brushes makel life easier & save me time.
B000CCML7G|4|Worked great getting my gummed up tuning machines working freely again.
B000BQRBB4|5|Works as expected
B00AO2CWJQ|5|I wish I would have invented these!
B00VH5P7OG|3|doesn't fit well, jeep is older so it really didn't matter. for a salvage jeep it got the job done
B003CG9PIC|5|Works as it should.
B0009IQXFO|5|Great for my black truck!
B000BQUUR6|4|works great but the mounting bracket is a little weak.
B007USCM7E|5|Super easy to refill like the instruction stated as 1, 2, squeeze! After 15-20 minutes cool AC is back. Thank you!
B00DJ5KEEA|5|works like its supposed to
B00471QQ9C|5|Fits and works perfectly! 2 1/2 months in and no issues. :)
B00BGH3ORW|5|always love them
B00NTQLMS6|4|Not even going to lie I was not sure what I was getting but it works and I am very happy with it I will be buying more from here
B008BBUKF0|4|Best light output from others that i bought, got 3 for my 2015 Subaru legacy , 1-dome, 2-map, looked great worked well --BUT - started blowing fuses if all were on at the same time. I replaced each one back and fourth with stock and worked fine -- only all at once = fuse blows. Not sure if CANBUS Compatible.<br />  Replaced with plasma-leds and WOW!!  No fuses blown.<br />These look and work great if you don't blow fuses .
B007K8LT46|5|These work well for a 318 ti BMW
B001CA22FI|4|Just what we needed at a decent price
B0000WSYYW|5|Nice set. Works great.. I'd get it again.
B000ONZXPK|5|great product, i've been using it for 16 years never had an issue with it.
B00JIEX722|3|Pretty bright...lights up whole plate area on my bumper...BUT one of them is already acting up. it works but is very sensitive in the socket. i have to play with its position to keep it lit
B00LBVV2Y0|1|DO NOT BUY!!! Almost started a fire in my rv. GARBAGE!!!
B001XLG5FE|5|this is my second one, I purchased it for my significant other and he LOVES IT! awesome. Super fun, and lots of compliments! I have the white one for my white Subaru and it looks fabulous. His mustang looks better but hey, red is mcqueen! ;-)
B000M8NZW0|4|bought for someone else
B00HZBE7LK|1|Product is not what I expected it to be. It is not a vinyl &#34;cut&#34; sticker. It is just a piece of white vinyl with printing on it. Good thing I only wasted a few bucks.
B00CI42W5W|5|This carrier is really awesome.  The instructions provided by Teraflex are very clear and easy to follow.  It took me about 2 hours to install, mainly due to the time it takes to remove and install the T50 torx screws.  It just takes time to crank them around with the tool provided by Teraflex. All of the holes lined up nicely, and there were no issues during installation.  My only concern was how tight I was cranking down the screws/bolts, because I don't have a torque wrench. This carrier is very solid and was a nice upgrade to the stock tire carrier.  The rear gate feels and shuts very solid, now.  I highly recommend this as a 35&#34; tire carrier that keeps a stock look and feel.
B004D4URV6|5|Worked great!
B00EVHVJV2|4|Okay but cheap.
B0012S9A5U|5|Without these I couldn't remove the hangers from the muffler to install my tow hitch.  Worked like a charm, though on my vehicle you could not use them reverse to put the hangers back on.
B00OFU33PU|5|Really neat product. Got it fast and I can't wait to use it!
B003BZWR16|4|Very good gaffers tape. It leaves no residue if removed with a couple of days. If it is left on longer there may be a white line of residue along the edges, particularly outdoors.
B00480N0E6|5|Exactly what we needed.
B0080E4MNE|5|So far so good
B0030430KK|5|Fit my camper's city water inlet perfectly.  It installed in minutes, 1) Cut old one off with pocket knife (may be brittle), 2) slide loop over inlet, 3) Put cap over inlet.  No fuss easy install!
B00KTIC5B0|5|great
B00SYRF4OS|5|works great highly recommend
B000CSQETQ|4|Car runs great!
B00JVHLS3G|1|Poor quality. Bought this within two weeks the white had faded to a cream/ugly off white color. The adhesive also came unglued within about 3-3.5 weeks.Fortuantely I was using this for a project and not on my car, but if I had bought this for my BMW I would be really upset having such a piece of junk on a nice car.
B002HUFUR4|1|Did not fit the car, was too short and kept slipping off.  Ripped trying to make it fit.  Lasted a couple of months.  Now I use it to cover plants in the winter.
B007P2ESCC|4|So I broke one of the 6-32 screws but luckily I was smart enough to assemble the housing before removing the stock air filter, the instructions were really confusing only because the picture quality was so bad, I had to refer to a YouTube video to figure a couple of things out.<br /><br />The install took me about an hour because I've never done this before, I have a 2014 dodge challenger rt anniversary edition and I've driven it for a little over a year now completely stock so I know what it sounds like, so let's start off with first impressions, I started the car up expecting a result right away, this wasn't the case and I was really skeptical so I went for a little ride and was unimpressed.... then I hit the gas petal and floored it and a huge roar like I've never heard came out of my engine and a big smile filled my face, wow this thing is a best, I really didn't expect that at all because idle and normal acceleration you can't really tell but if you floor it or at least half down there is a very noticeable difference between this and stock, I went with this filter because it out preformed many other filters and is very large, I almost couldn't get it in its own housing, this was a good buy
B00VKX781U|5|They fit perfect on my 2012 Ford Fiesta.  Easy to install and they look great!
B003UTH088|5|This fob saved me about $75 - what else is there to say? I bought a &#34;new&#34; car last month and the ONLY downside was that the previous owner lost the key fob. Since my car has remote start as well as a remote trunk and back glass, it really bummed me out not to have the fob. Not to mention the simple convenience of locking and unlocking without the key in the actual lock (I know, whiny first world problems!). When I checked the auto parts store, they did not carry the ones with remote start - and those were $70 alone! The dealership fobs which did have remote start were over $100. I (of course) turned to Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find this. It arrived quickly and the instructions were so simple to find - they were 3rd in line of my internet search. It did die after a week or so, but I replaced the battery and it's worked great ever since.
B00IG1Z7ZI|1|They will not fit a 2015 2500hd crew cab if it's got a duramax
B002IT9KZ2|5|husband loved it
B00HRXNLIG|5|Works as it should.  Broke my old one (intentionally) to remove it and slid this one in easily.  Now my mp3 player doesn't stop every time I hit a bump.
B0107UFZ7A|5|Amazing, so happy I purchased these, exactly as pictured down to the shade of blue
B00MQAG1X2|5|This item came in a timely manner and, although I thought it was a little expensive at first, I realized why when I received it.  It is of high quality and looks great on my new 2015 Mustang!!
B009DJMS4K|5|Working great.
B000EQD82C|4|Good filter for price
B000RNU47Y|5|Instructions a bit vague, but quite easy to install. Good price for a quality product.
B0027QWNGO|4|Great buy, will be used well
B00XOIZPY6|5|Very pleased with the jack.  Does the job with ease.
B0010HNQ58|4|perfect fit
B006X8BFLQ|5|Fit and looks great. Nice filler for the open area.
B0038AXQJ6|5|Hands above stock
B00K8RLZ0E|1|I am not happy with it..
B00KTIQAZW|5|works perfectly once programmed by the dealer  (only option BTW)
B000NSN7O0|5|I thought by orderjng from other then a good parts store that these would be light duty-- not the case they are heavier then original, comes with all new bolts an nuts, they go on a lot easier then the old ones come off !!
B0082365AQ|4|Once you figure out how to connect to the kayak - it's great!  Agree - smelly tires, but I got over that with the price.
B001N729FS|5|Works as described, very easy installation and operation.
B007Y86B5O|5|This was purchased for a 2004 Ford Expedition with a 5.4L motor.  The first box shipped from Amazon was mislabeled and contained a different alternator (not one for a 5.4L Ford).  After a quick online chat with Amazon Customer Service they had a replacment on the way - arrived next day.  Part was installed with a perfect fit for a 5.4L Ford.  Connections are 100% correct.  Performance is better than expected and maintains 14.42 Volts at idle.  This unit supports the truck in full use mode (all lights, radio, all other electrical running) with no issues.  For the price and the function this can not be beat.  Also no core charge...just order, install, drive.  Thanks Amazon for your amazing customer service support.
B000IYP7ME|5|good brand at a great price
B00C8YXH9C|5|Perfect for the boat! Great replacement for the flares that need to be replaced ever couple years.
B0006I0NU8|4|Fits the cabinet perfectly on the RV
B009G4Y9RG|5|Great Price for a Great Product!
B005271AZA|5|Installing was a breeze no complaints here!
B00G620ZVU|4|Starting to see some moister inside the lens.  Otherwise very bright!!
B00KSDSYCK|1|Does not fit a 2011 Chrysler 200.  No place for the seat belt to work.  Had to cut it to make it work and then sew it so it wouldn't tear and shred.
B00PG2QA1K|2|OK as a side-table, but not sturdy enough to hold anything heavy--not even a potted plant.
B005EUY2JG|5|Great sticker
B002X6VXL4|5|Perfect !!!!
B003UYYGTO|1|I bought these because these are about the only rack of their kind on the market, and Kolpin is supposed to be the best. Well, these are aweful. As many have stated, the plastic framework leaves a whole lot of room for improvement. I have now noticed on Kolpin's website that they have revised the instructions to basically say these aren't for guns or heavy objects in the full tilt position. Well, that's what I got these for to haul weed eaters, pole saws, shovels, etc. on the rear of my role cage of my new Honda Pioneer. The old instructions were sent with the item and didn't say this. Buyer beware.
B000LN4ZAM|3|It is not one piece but two.
B00026Z3HM|5|This works great and is a real time saver.
B007FJR4QM|5|Excellent product. Nice material and fit to perfection on my Acura TL
B001C92VKA|5|I am very pleased with the performance of the EBC brake pads.  This is my second pair for the rear wheels of my VW Jetta.  Long lasting, quality product.  I would buy then again.
B002KG7Z6O|5|Glad I read reviews, you def need to get a size larger than you normally would. Other than that, its perfect color, style, everything I expected. I'd def recommend it!
B00HRXNLIG|5|exact OEM part needed to replace the AUX-in on my girl's 2008 Civic. great price too!
B001TJZ6IC|5|Love them will order another set soon
B0062NPM16|1|I had a very hard time getting this to work
B000IY8OLU|5|I installed this set a few years ago, Had no problems at all
B000SDVEU4|5|Love it! Thanks!
B001GN2C1K|5|direct fit. plugged right into factory harness on the frame. even came with a couple zip ties.  2011 Xterra S.
B008YIGPFO|5|Awesome equipment, awesome delivery. Plug n Play.
B00L847KGE|3|Nice fog lights for the price. They are little on the flimsy side in my opinion. They fit nicely in the valance and work so far.
B000KKPFFA|5|Used to assemble a teak shower stool without fasteners but with some fancy joinery. I was looking for waterproof and strong bonds.
B0090LJ786|5|Absolutely perfect could not have been bettrr
B00T4TEWBQ|4|Good
B007CVGTIC|5|Worked perfect for what i was using it for. Sturdy product
B00X5FK5Z2|1|not original.
B00RM327NG|2|Don't like it. My phone would not stay on and that was without a case on it.
B007772HG4|5|Wow these are great! My husband and I would get into arguments trying to line up the trailer in the past. Now easy and first try!
B000CR1RNU|5|I haven't used these yet. However I have used these in the past. I have never seen a brighter light for night time dark and rainy driving on the lonely and poorly marked back roads here in western Oregon. I use an older style foot switch so that I can dim them instantly while having my hands occupied in whatever is happening.
B009LP2TAO|4|Arrived early but 2 days. Was very easy to install took about 10 minutes. Works very well can't tell any difference between old one and new one.
B00JGQLU5S|5|Exactly what I need without driving everywhere looking for it.
B006W5AKIO|5|Love it.. Represent what you Ride..
B00DOI8CV4|5|High quality
B008LUXS3M|5|These things are bad ass. I have a hard cover on the bed of my truck and installed these. The wiring was a little different (with LEDs you have to have the correct wires hooked up the correct way. Can't reverse polarity of the power) but after I figured out the issue and got them going, I now  can almost sun tan in the bed of my truck.
B008BSWPT2|5|Original equipment replacement. The handle has a design flaw which I fixed by filling the front side with epoxy to strengthen it. Works great, so far.
B00YB47HX4|1|Junk
B00EA4JCGA|1|useless. My threw away that
B0052UIKL4|5|Excellent... More than I expected. Ed bailey
B001DRJLAE|5|Direct bolt on installation. Quality materials and components. Installed as part of a complete performance upgrade. Very satisfied.
B00HHGSY30|5|Fit perfect. They have about 4,000 miles and going strong.
B00CFBT90O|5|great price
B000MY0MQ6|5|fits perfectly on gr 35 battery. very happy
B000EDQQJW|5|Perfect
B00XV500W4|5|Excellent jacket. Fit great when using the sizing chart, and all the pockets help when riding. The removable vest also helps to keep cool when riding on the warm days.
B00F685J2U|5|great hitch, quick delivery
B00EFPDU3K|3|ok
B00OUVLZHM|4|Once we got all we needed for it to wrk right, my bf was very happy with the whole item.<br />👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
B000JZE9LW|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B000W7K588|5|Magnet worked great to hang the bottle. Only downside to the whole bottle was that the attached magnet also left an exit point for any fluids. I never filled it enough that brake fluid leaked out, but when I cleaned it up with denatured alcohol and shook the bottle some leaked out. Not an earth shattering deal, just wanted to note it, especially since brake fluid will eat paint off of most things.
B000C9PKM2|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B0012QBYBU|5|I run these in my 2002 Civic EX, absolutely no complaints and this is my 2nd set. New set of these along with a timing belt change this summer and on a 700 mile round trip I got 38mpg both ways which is the best my car has ever gotten (without a stiff tailwind).
B003IS3HV0|5|Out of all the leather conditioning products on Amazon after trying a couple of them I gave this a try.it worked very well and with only a small amount it really madethe leather in my car softer and looking new.great I product.
B0002SRDR8|1|Not very happy the blades broke right away i didnt even get to cut a full windshield out the min i started k<br />It broke
B00IO2JRMI|5|Worked very well
B003NU0EM8|1|I attached suction cup to vehicle, clamped handle, pulled and cup tore away from the handle, cheap product.
B008CE0R40|5|Solid in the sense that they are heavy and durable. They are not &#34;solid rubber&#34;, they are solid construction. They are heavy and sticky so they stay put. I like them a lot. I use them on my RV and the size  blocks the width of the tire. Yes they have a strong smell like a new tire but you are not using it indoors right?
B0078ZM7EM|5|Used this for my light bar set up on my Dodge Ram.  Works great and looks cool.  The LED lights up very bright, but I can't be too picky with how much it costs.
B004J30NHO|4|Product is very well made. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the directions for installation are terrible. I figured it out but it took me probably half an hour longer than it should. Satisfied with final product though
B00V40O402|5|Excellent replacement part. Fairly easy to install on a 2010 Vibe.
B00L844JBI|5|These replaced the badly yellowed and damaged OEM lights without any issues.  They bolted right up, and although they were a pain to install without removing the bumper, it is doable with a little patience.  The truck now looks much better without milk colored yellow headlights, and I can now see when driving at night!
B0002SRF4O|5|This worked great on my 1971 Honda CB450. Be sure to rotate the piston and valves out of the way. Use grease on the tap and all the shavings will fall into a nice pile on the piston. They stick together from the grease. I tapped it in two runs. The first time I didn't go all the way in and backed it out to clean off the tap and apply fresh grease. It hogs out a lot of aluminum. When you're done attach a straw to the hose on your shop vac and vacuum the shavings right out. Easy.
B012HHJ7OS|3|Adapters are plastic and won't even fit on my Z.
B00TPGA168|5|The the front brakes work great, though the rears were incompatible with my car. I didn't want to leave a negative product review for a product because Amazon indicated that the brakes were compatible with my car, but in fact, were not. Unfortunately, I didn't find out they were wrong until my mechanic called me when my car was on the lift, and the fronts had already been installed.<br /><br />After another failed Amazon brake order, I called Power Stop's customer service, who gave me the correct kit number. Just as a warning to my fellow Audi A6 C5 Quattro owners out there - most of the Power Stop rear brake kits that Amazon says are compatible with our cars are, in fact, NOT compatible. My advice is to double-check with the manufacturer of whatever parts you order to guarantee that they're a fit for your vehicle. Don't rely on Amazon's vehicle compatibility feature.
B000CODPF6|5|These are your basic 6 Ton jack stands.  If you have an offroader then you'll want two pair.  They'll easily hold a Jeep off the ground.  The height is great when you need to unload the suspension.  You'll still probably want to have a pair of the shorter jack stands for placing under the axles as well.  I bought them when they were $25.  The 'shear-pin', a bunch of people seem to mention isn't really a concern to me.  I've never had any problem with this style before.  These were a good value and cheap insurance.
B004SSAFTG|5|Fits perfectly. Still in great condition after 3 years.
B001KRH71W|4|Excellent fit.  Didn't have to drill any holes for my 95 wrangler.
B000C5UFK8|5|Installed and &#34;check engine&#34; light that has plagued me is off and has stayed off....perfect!
B00L6ABZCK|5|Easy to use portable jumper and cell phone charger.  You never know when a emergency (dead battery happens.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Great sunshade. It is rather large but it covers the entire windshield and folds up nicely into its case!
B00AEK55WY|4|Very bright & versatile.
B0010GG7YG|5|works great looks just oem.
B00RC85FUI|1|Very low quality for the price and the HRC logo is off center. Cheap item
B00ACD8TFS|4|Received item in a timely fashion, which was 5 days after order using standard shipping and includes weekend days. Works as described. It is a little flimsy and not the prettiest thing to look at,which are the only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Ultimately that doesn't matter as long as the person in the car behind me can see the light. Seems to be as bright as the built-in light was. This third brake light is being used in lieu of a $250 replacement cost of the built-in break light(which is ridiculous!)because have to take out half the the car to replace the light in a 2008 Chevy Malibu Hybrid. This will work for now to prevent me from getting a traffic ticket for not having working third break light, and definitely is cheaper than a ticket.
B00267PZUK|5|Excellent tool.  Broke 3 of 8 plugs after following all clean/soak recommendations from Ford and others who have done the job.  The Lisle tool made this a non-issue.  It simply became a procedure to follow.  I would now tell anyone considering the job to get this tool and don't sweat over breaking plugs.  Takes about 20 extra minutes per plug, but really no big deal.
B00A3D2LOC|5|Great part - good price
B00CNEQZHS|5|Perfect replacements for my GMC Denali.  My heavy rear hatch now floats up once again.  (Why did I wait so long to replace my old ones?)<br /><br />Takes ~3 minutes to install both... and you don't even need any tools!<br /><br />I wish more things in life were like this... simple ordering (and less than half the price as @ Checker Auto), quick delivering of accurate product, crazy easy to install.... and they work... the 1st time!
B00C43BOTM|5|Cant beat the price !
B00PQDUOSO|4|Very bright, but not a lot of difference between high/low. Eliminates shadows when riding in a group. Fit pretty well. Had to pry the rubber boot around the plug, but very nice for the price.
B00HJ1EHES|5|Works fine,perfect fit for my 97 12 valve.
B004JB7900|5|Right parts great fit fast shipment car runs and idles better than it has in a long time
B00JHK81X2|5|Maybe the words inexpensive and emergency don't belong in the same sentence, but cost doesn't directly relate to quality in this case!! This kit includes just about all the essentials you'd need. However I'm a firm believer in making your own kit and including things you personally feel you'll want/need/use in an emergency. This kit starts you off ahead of the curve and actually comes with some extra space in the bag. Great for adding more stuff OR just nice not to cram everything back into a tiny bag after use! The most surprising item in the kit for me was the flashlight, believe it or not. It's a three LED light (so no busted bulbs) that's crank powered (so no dead/leaking batteries). But it seems to be very efficient. 4-5 cranks had the LEDs lit at full power for the 5 or so minutes I let it sit powered on. Got tired of waiting for them to die. hahaha I comes with two glow sticks. Be aware that glow sticks have a shelf life. Though I did find some numbers stamped on one edge of the package, I couldn't really make out a date. Only number that MIGHT have been a date are BJ0320. Maybe March 2020, but I highly doubt it. The bungee cord seemed adequate quality, which surprised me.....as did the multitool. It's certainly no leatherman or gerber, but better than some &#34;flea market&#34; or &#34;give away&#34; ones I've come across. The gloves I thought we're actually above average. They're reasonably thick and the texture surface gives great grip. All in all, very solid kit. Worth every penny and then some.<br /><br />Ideas for other items I'll include in the kit? Rubber gloves for sure. If I run across an accident, I'm happy to help... but I'm not getting a stranger's blood on me. Far too many open wounds on my hands to chance that. Other than that, I'll probably include a small ratcheting screwdriver with various tips and expand on the first-aid kit. Tourniquet kit for example. Maybe a small pair of tough scissors? And then some true survival supplies like a couple&#34;calorie bars&#34;, another emergency blanket, waterproof matches, and the LifeStraw would be a great idea.
B00407YQTK|5|Works great
B00EDELV6G|3|I like the protection, but not the looks. This rear mat perfectly fit the entire rear area of my 2015 Silverado. It extends all the way back under the rear seats. Every inch of the rear floor of the vehicle is covered. However, the mat is made of a material that resembles vinyl. Once I got it in the truck, the carpeted area of my truck was totally covered and it resembled a work truck that you would purchase with vinyl floors in it. Unless someone knew better, they would swear you had vinyl floors in your truck. I set my factory mats over it and it improved the look.  I will leave it in a few days and see if it grows on me before sending it back. I started to order the front WeatherTech set that covered the center hump also, and I am glad that I didn't. I think that I am going to order the Husky x-act mats for the front, they seem to look better and be more heavy duty.
B00FTB3YNA|5|work good
B00YR0ILH8|5|Couldn't be more pleased
B001Q3E5W4|4|works as advertised
B004L2LS36|5|works well.
B0081ZZPHO|5|This thing is awesome<br />It looks bad a** love it
B002X6VXL4|5|Useful to jump dead battery of vehicle and air up on flat tire. Real cooler and very helpful
B004OH8XEK|5|Good quality vehicle parts and all necessary parts in one bag.  Being installed on a boat trailer that swims in the salty seawater pretty much assures I'll be back for duplicate parts a few years on.  Great price.
B000FQ1SWI|5|Just like the originals on my jeep Tj
B00DTEELAO|1|Bought new off Amazon (JC Motors), used it a few times and worked well. Always stored it in the box and only used it maybe 3-4 times. Now, after only 4 months, it won't hold a steady pressure reading when I turn it on or connect it. Its of no use. Fox says this is made by someone else with their sticker on it, so contact who bought from....nice! guess I won't buy anything with the Fox logo since it is just a marketing logo.<br /><br />I see no way to check the battery, nor a way to service it.<br />I'll contact JC Motors...but I can only assume no help at this point.<br /><br />Design is good...the long head worked well on hard to reach CRF250R fork, so I liked the design. but if it doesn't work, its useless.<br /><br />Buy something else!
B00GZKC6EW|5|This product is Great premium fully synthetic motor oils that are formulated with the highest quality base oils and enhanced with the most advanced additive technology for ultimate performance in meeting the latest requirements for modern engines in North America. Much better than mobil 1 0W-20
B006LPZINM|4|Great looking product exactly as described.  If you have a GP shift aftermarket rear set you may have some interference issues.  Otherwise its not terrible to install you can do it without removing the body work from your bike.
B000E28MZE|5|Fit my Honda SC700 Nighthawk with nary a hitch.  No leakage, no oil pressure problems.
B00GHT9G6W|5|Perfect replacement and cheaper than any salvage yard.  Works great and seems like it will last for years.
B007NVSWE0|5|Excellent for shoulder support while<br />Doing physical work.
B001KO6D5Q|5|Actually purchased this to use on my... electric mobility scooter.<br /><br />My personal electric mobility device is a Travelscoot; it has a twist throttle, and when using it for prolonged periods of time (think Walt Disney World, or a day at the State Fair, trade shows, etc.)  I could *really* feel the arthritis that is rapidly developing in my right hand.<br /><br />On the advice of another Travelscoot user, I purchased a Crampbuster for my first Travelscoot.  The difference was immediate - it really does make an enormous difference!<br /><br />Although this product is a chrome-colored plastic, it still looks great on my aluminum-framed scooter.  Highly recommend for any twist throttle device!
B003V9UU66|5|Thanks
B005UW4O8C|5|right part right shipping time right price
B00UFIF2KK|5|Fit my 2009 ZX6R. Look great. Probably work.
B00TP5WVT4|5|mirrors do exactly what they are designed to do. im happy with the purchase
B00S5658RQ|3|The product was delivered on a timely manner and it looked awesome and we were excited to receive it! The unique lights made the helmet more visible at night. Unfortunately, due to no fault of the sellers, we had to return the jelmet after only using it for 3 days. It began to fray along the jawline along the base of the helmet. The seller offered to send us another bit there wasnt a way to guarantee this same thing wouldnt happen again. At the price point of this helmet, it should not have deteoriated this quickly.
B001GRW1VM|5|Works kids right
B000AMZJXG|5|fit perfect about 5.00 $ cheaper than auto parts store.
B00P9HE0EQ|3|I have two different chairs.  It did not fit on either. But looks like it would work great of it fit.
B000HS1356|2|Durability and longevity - these are a couple cornerstones that any cover is sought after for. I was suggested this cover from several sources, touting how long they've had theirs and how it's still in great condition.  I purchased mine back in FEB '14, and 2 years later I'm finding the back end starting to rip and tear. Pic shown.  Perhaps someday I'll purchase a cover that genuinely lasts several years, unfortunately (again) I have purchased another &#34;for awhile&#34; cover. 2 stars because it actually lasted well up until now. But, I didn't purchase a cover just for how well it fits, or ease of use, or JUST durability - I wanted a cover that lasted MANY years. This is not one of those.
B00A0VGKJY|5|Eazy to install... my paint job is now protected when it rains
B005LXTOHQ|5|Worked great.
B00BLAG3D6|5|As Chaplain for our Department I use my personal vehicle to respond to structure fires....this light is a great tool. bright.....and doesnt obstruct your view as you drive.
B00GWV52PE|5|Cool.
B00Y7BLATI|5|Beautiful
B001TANEOO|5|Totally awesome product! Fit my 2006 Prius perfectly and they work well. Shipped super fast too
B000C5BYCQ|5|Looks great. Fits great. Works. Quick shipping
B00MY3K3XK|1|Horrible brake dust. Worst I ever dealt with. Squeaked like crazy even with anti squeal. Replaced with Wagner immediately, problem solved.
B0066RZH0Y|5|Perfect!  Fit as expected and right on time!
B00KNMKRU8|5|I have the Stanley version, also $50 at Walmart.  Works great!  West Marine also sells the same charger under their own brand name for $100.  I guess if add &#34;Marine&#34; to your product name you get to double the price.
B00OW4W93G|5|Fit well
B0073X74X8|5|Looks much classier than original. Reception of Sirius, AM, FM just as good. Easy installation on my 2014 Fusion Titanium Hybrid.
B00DL6T2YK|4|Yes, it is fine...might be a little small gauge for my old eyes ...but good value and tests out accurately
B00LBAF9S6|5|They work great!
B00JE4GWI2|1|This product DOES NOT fit in double input Fakra setup as it says it will. You are better off getting the inputs that are molded into a single plastic piece because these two will not fit when combined side by side.
B00YDDT9IO|5|very good quality
B00NJJ0NPG|1|Garbage. I installed these bulbs on my lawn mower, turned them on and they worked. The second time I turned them on, neither of them will come on. I put the halogen bulbs back in and they work fine. Looks like both bulbs are defective...
B00K8VQE7Y|5|It helps with the heat, and I get lots of compliments from other drivers in the parking lot. Love it!
B008G28KGK|4|It look amazing.  Good price.  It did not fit prefectly in but it does the job.
B00A6X10OG|5|Very satisfied with this product. I am always pleased when I can go to AMAZON.COM and quickly locate exactly what I want at a better price than I can find locally, in the case, the auto parts store.<br />Its so easy to have my automobiles on record and know that I'm getting the correct part.
B00LV18KWM|2|didn't work well with my hitch, was too thick couldn't really get it inside to lock down.
B000C2AM7W|5|As described. Perfect fit.  Just what I needed.
B00TXQDMBQ|5|Can i get a white sticker with the same design? Also can i see how the sticker will look like in white color?
B00L8448C8|5|Good
B00HWI39OC|5|nice item... as expected...
B00I9SK58M|1|extremely disappointed . not the same color as the picture. it's more pinky. wasted my money and now I don't know what to do with the cans..since there is no return policy.
B0002JMLQU|5|good price
B0083VRCPY|5|quick and easy all around
B004GEEZJ8|5|Easy to install, looks like an OEM handle. Would purchase again.
B00VH643H2|5|I live in an apartment in midtown Manhattan.  3rd Floor.  I am a kind of neat freak.  I have a Dyson vacuum, a Shop Vac dry/wet vacuum, a McCullough Steamer (their biggest), and I use microfiber cloths for most of my cleaning.  My apt gets a daily dose of greasy, black, soot-like, stuff on everything - every day.  It's NYC's best kept secret.  I don't know if this layer of black, greasy dust is from being close to the street, if its just general &#34;huge-city&#34; dirt, or if its pollutants from secret CIA experiments.  But, I  use a paper towel or a dry Swiffer on the floors and countertops (and etc) before I wipe with anything damp. I usually run a vacuum over it first, then Swiffer, then microfiber.  But for window sills, windows, leather furniture, and a whole lot of other things, I use these great wash towels (after I vacuum the surface).  Damp or dry, these guys are the best rags for really dirty jobs.  Yes, these get filthy.  They are the first - or second - step of most of my cleaning chores.  When I'm finished with each towel, I can decide whether to soak it, put it in the basket with other dirty rags to wash, or if it is beyond cleaning, I toss it into the trash.  I love these towels for wiping the shower curtain rods that I keep replacing hoping to find one that doesn't turn towels black where they touch, the rusting door hinges and hot water pipe running from floor to ceiling in my bathroom, under and behind the radiators, the exterior side of the windows, the tops of my a/c window units, and the weird, empty space under my kitchen sink cabinet bottom that I forget to clean.  They don't fall apart on these jobs like paper towels, and I don't have to use a microfiber cloth that would never never look clean again after getting so filthy.  They  last a long time even with the jobs I assign to them.  And you can bleach them or whatever to keep them looking hygenic and actually being clean.
B00C7I4SUG|4|As expected
B00335F7XE|5|Great price looks amazing on my truck
B000P7O5DG|1|Product arrived. Green light turned on (as if it was ready to work). Plugged in 3 different car charges and nothing worked. No power to the DC side. Returning it today. Amazon already gave me the refund (Gotta love Amazon)!
B002J7VX4Y|4|Gives your car that new smell again. Just wish the smell lasted longer. Good product.
B009TWHO9A|4|Just what I wanted.
B007TYGRSO|3|Not a perfect fit as the factory one had to replace factory light water was getting inside lens but this one doesnt fit in body lines as most aftermarket parts but it works
B00ETHGCDY|5|Thanks!
B000WJDJRA|5|The lightbar arrived promptly,  was what I wanted, I did have to get the lightbar relocation kit due to the windshield.  Looks great
B0075MREHI|2|One of the aluminum sleeves was crushed.  There was a fine metal residue inside this item.  It was not properly washed out after it's machining process.  I guess most customers using this would notice but if not, it'd suck to introduce all those fines into your oil reservoir.  It took a while before I was ready to use it and found this out.  Now the return window has closed on me or I would have sent it back.
B00BT1H1ME|5|A must buy,saves you tons of money.
B00KWEL7Y2|4|OEM is OEM
B00N3VYMJ8|3|This is a good looking knob at a good price, but i can not seem to get it to stay secure on the wheel on my boat, even using the provided spacers.<br /><br />v/r<br />Rocky
B001JT1FJ6|5|Makes motor coach run good.
B005X796DC|5|Fits perfectly, does the job.
B00W8DBZQU|2|They look well made but after using them only 2 months, the tread is worn off beneath the gas pedal.  Would I buy them again?  No - nothing like the heavy duty mats I have been using for years.  I really liked the way they fit and how they look but wouldn't spend the money on them again as they don't look like they will hold up very well if there is that much wear after 2 months.
B0092ZWDNG|5|Great visor that completely fills window, as you would expect from custom fit shade....price is right, and easy to roll up and tie with velcro strap it comes with....would buy again, but prolly won't need to
B00E82K8Z8|4|I dont give it a 5 star rating just because the last part of the installation; tearing the protective film was quite a task. In fact the installation can get a bit tricky. You have one chance and that´s it. Otherwise this insert works like magic. Very happy with it.
B00ONGVAIS|5|was the right part and fit great
B00CHSVS8Q|5|Fit like a glove!
B0091UL4YQ|5|Excellent look and deflects like it's suppose to do. Don't settle for a cheap impression.
B00TE8GKLM|5|Thank you very much it was a perfect fit
B001UFXS26|5|Great Product!
B002SSGB1E|5|Easy to use and effective.
B002P8HL0M|3|It functions but mirror doesn't stay in place, wasn't a perfect fit on installation. I'd recommend finding one at a junkyard or buying OEM.
B000C5A0LW|5|Ordered this along with the K90429 for passenger's side to install in my Skunk2 LCAs. This one doesn't have a hold for the allen key, and the bolt at the end of the shaft was fast to the shaft so it installed easily with my wrench directly into the skunk LCA. However, the K90429 for the passenger side did require an allen wrench, which made it insanely difficult to install. I'm going to return the passenger side one and try to find a version like this one for that side too.
B00BRL73Z6|5|fit great
B000TYTSH8|2|Wrong size item
B00J4Z9R8I|1|Did match my MX 350 as stated in the product description.  Poor return policy.
B001UC3BQW|5|Works great. Good alternative if you mess up the fill plug on the front of the differential. Put a few coats of clear coat on it.
B00NEL7NY8|5|This is the cleaning product you need if you're investing in a K&N cabin air filter which, if kept clean with their product, will last the life of your vehicle.
B00603DSGO|4|A great mount just wish it held the antenna straight not at an angle, but you get use to it.
B00LPIA3T4|4|Helpful tool, but not 5* because it is not &#34;solid&#34; enough...
B00A1X9AES|5|good quality filter
B00MQUAM28|5|Great sound. Noticeably louder than stock. I don['t understand the point of stickers.. They are useless. Not only they are cheap and come off easily, but nobody will see them under the hood/grill. I suppose it's a good thing that they are cheap and come off easily - don't leave a mess.
B00U2TZCNY|4|These work great. Don't spend anytime thinking about it, just buy it. One star off because the rocker switch is too easy to flip through the middle off setting to either high or low depending where you started from. In other words, if you have it on low, and you attempt to turn off while riding, it's very easy to flip it through the off position and to high. But it works great.
B012DZMJX0|5|Great purchase. Fast delivery. Everything as expected.
B003NU9O0G|5|Great product and value.
B004L0365G|5|Easy to hook up ,replaces older marker lights
B0045WBVUM|5|Great product.  Made my bike seat so comfortable.
B009DK28Y4|4|Inexpensive and works as expected. I do not know the longevity as it has not gotten a lot of use.
B0039Z1UHA|5|Only problem is how easy it comes undone. I guess is the nature of the material
B00CIVE9HE|5|Slightly taller and a little heavier than the original shift knob, I was surprised how much more I actually liked this. Feels really sturdy and looks good.
B000RXKR6M|4|Works great
B00AVN7Q1C|5|Stickers are thick and seem durable. I cannot comment on whether or not they fade since I just got them. Also included in the package were two small American flag stickers and four American flag crest stickers. I'm sure I'll find a good use for those!<br /><br />Don't be misled by the title, however! These are 4.7' long flags... When I purchased them, I saw that it said 4,7&#34;, completely overlooked the 120mm measurement, and assumed 4&#34;x7&#34;. That was my mistake though. The size is written out properly in the item description. Woops. :)<br /><br />These are great quality vinyl decals and if they sold a 7 inch flag decal I'd by it in a heartbeat!
B00E9S5F1S|5|Great.
B00D5OFHJW|3|Good spray, however I expect a better quality of fragrance. Lasts long though, so less gas in the container.
B00A6AS6LY|5|This fit my '03 Wrangler TJ with no leakage and was incredibly helpful in burping the system of air (which the 4.0L engine is notoriously bad about). Plenty of videos online showed just pulling the cap and letting the coolant burp all over the engine bay, but that wastes glycol and makes a mess. With this I topped off the radiator plus about 1/3 of the funnel (see photo), fired up the jeep and let it idle with the heater on max while squeezing hoses. Once I could squeeze every hose without seeing bubbles I revved it up to ~2000 RPM in neutral, let it idle for another 20 minutes, then shut the engine off and let it cool overnight. I came back the next morning and plugged the funnel with the included t-handle &#34;wand&#34;, then transferred the coolant left in the funnel into the overflow bottle and capped the radiator. Zero mess.<br /><br />Definitely makes the job easier and cleaner, but the reason I give it 5 stars is because after using it I am sure there are zero air bubbles lingering in my cooling system.
B00MTIJBYM|5|awesome
B008WTO0G6|5|I Love My Sticker So Much.
B006CRT72W|5|Works great, easy to install, short range. Here is how you program remotes.<br /><br />Cycle key from off to on position, not start, 5-8 times. Go slow around 5. When your door locks cycle, keep the key on.<br /><br />Hit the lock button on each remote you have, one at a time. The locks will cycle to confirm they are receiving the remotes after each one.<br /><br />Once you have entered your remotes into the system, turn the key off. The locks will cycle one last time when you do this to confirm your completion.<br /><br />Easiest thing I have ever done to a vehicles electronics!
B00068XCQU|5|Must have for those periods when riding my bike isn't possible.
B002QLYA48|5|It's a gas charged lift support and it supports just great. What more can I say. Buy it if you need it. Works great as a lift support.
B00CULEPVC|1|This is a bad design. If you turn the key off , it locks the meter level. You then must hook the charger up for 6 minutes to reset it. It stopped working at all after 4 months. The seller refused a refund.
B002H1GC9I|5|Love this helmet, This is my 3rd one
B00527HGIU|1|Leather seems to be wearing out a lot faster than I would have expected. For the price I am extreamly disappointed. Not sure if legit OEM TRD
B000N9JFR2|5|Fit my 1989 Sea Ray 180 with Chevy 4.3 and 2 bbl carb perfectly.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Very easy to install and works like a charm. Directions that came with it were perfect.
B007TG7HVI|4|work great and a great price
B0009PI13E|5|This is exactly what we were looking for and half the price.  It also arrived sooner than expected.
B003TUQLY2|3|When measured in multiple locations the closest thickness I measured was about 76mil WITH the protective backing...  There were many measurements of 45-55 mil.  Emailed FatMat they said this was normal and they claim a &#34;nominal&#34; thickness not actual.  Regardless I decided to install it due to a deadline that had to be hit.  I worked in the car audio industry for 10 years using DynaMat primarily and this stuff just isn't up to snuff. Within 24 hours there were areas on the door where there were high contour bends exhibiting the aluminum backing pealing off the compound.  Hopefully it will hold up and not continue backing off over time.  I will be ordering multiple products next time to compare, this won't be one of them though.  Also, as for the smell, I think they've got this under control.  With all doors complete yet unpaneled and sitting in the 105 degree Texas sun for a day there was only a slight asphalt smell. With panels back on you have to have a very sensitive nose o notice anything at all after a week.  I'm confident it will be odorless to someone not knowing what was done.
B001C4UQKW|5|Fit just like oem filter now more power and better fuel miliage
B00DZL2BP8|5|JUST GOT IT TODAY. LOVED IT.
B0009PSJ22|3|it's good
B0059HK0HM|5|As expected!
B003RW1AMK|5|This was a great purchase. Speedy shipping, and programming took about 10 seconds. If you lost your remote, I highly recommend this product!
B006OQ35GU|2|It worked great for about the first three times I dumped with it, but now it dribbles.  Pretty annoying.
B00JILXIOM|4|Buy it it's worth the money and time it would take make one. The only thing I didn't like was the on/off switch that came with it....a little wimpy...easy fix, go to the auto parts store and pick up another one (nice lighted toggle), it makes the cost go up but it's still worth the money.
B0023VF1Y4|5|THEY LOOK GREAT ON MY 2003 BMW 325I . I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME... SUPER EASY TO INSTALL !
B00BIA2P9A|5|ok
B00O8RUYZC|4|THESE LOOKS SOO COOL AT NIGHT , VERY BRIGHT ... A LITTLE TOUGH TO INSTALL , SOME DIDNT FIT QUITE RIGHT BUT I MANAGED !
B006SA3T90|5|Stuck this on the passenger side of my boss' Porsche, lasted for 2 weeks before someone dropped the dime..... AWESOME!!!
B006TOJLX8|5|How can you not love this!
B002ZC1EOM|5|I love this little compressor. I carry it on my motorcycle, when everyone else brags about there co2 style inflators and run out, there happy to borrow mine. I've given some away as gifts and have only broke one, but was able to tear apart and get it to work long enough.<br />Great product, I don't think I would use it for automobiles.
B0007XU4EC|5|Fixed my problem with half the cost
B004TRKBOK|5|Haven't had to use it, but it looks like it will do the trick.
B00TJ1ZUAQ|3|Extremely thin material, unlike OEM. Perhaps 1/2 the thickness of original. It is shipped rolled up, that's how flimsy it is. Beware.
B008S20V9M|1|sensor didn't even work I ended up just going to autozone.
B00E7VFL8E|4|Excellent product but the tape supplied is too thick.
B009FO1T4S|5|Good quality. Bright colors
B00H5A4I6K|4|Just a heads up will not work on a 2015 Wrangler.  Brown factory connection (see photo) has a cut out for a guide. The guide rail on the extensions (black connector) is on the opposite side.<br /><br />But the connections into the fog lights work
B00LGIFWV2|4|It is hard to know when you unscrewed it enough to disconnect power.  Otherwise it is a solid product.
B00V5B3PT6|5|Excellent quality....easy installation...looks great.  Super price
B00GB7EKDY|5|very good.
B00XIMJG84|5|It works reslly well especially in the evening sun.
B00JCTTM7C|4|Product is up to standards its a little bigger than i was thinking it was but no biggie the only reason im giving it 4 stars is because the font is not the same as the picture
B007O1X8K2|5|green leds t use as turn signal indicators. woo hoo
B001GN3ESU|5|Doing it's job.  Well made.
B004W0KK0E|5|Good heavy metal construction.
B00SCDED0K|5|great detail
B0007VFM8C|5|Solid construction.<br />Took 1.5 hrs to install.
B008PHIB1A|2|The design is really pretty but the product is way too small for my car, a Honda Fit, which is a small car. I end up returning it.
B003U4O414|5|Good price. My due diligence finds this to be a great product. Hard to quantify.
B001P3035I|5|Great!!!
B00N77SCJY|5|Best customer support. They listened to my concerns about the product and responded promptly. I'm very happy with it and I get a lot of compliments!!!!
B00BCRMA9Y|1|Junk
B000IDUW5C|5|Bought these for wife and daughter. They actually said the felt more prepared. However don't demo on your own truck or you have to replace stuff. Test on a piece of wood, glass bottle, etc.
B00569CPLC|5|Exactly what I was looking for !  And fast shipping !!!!!
B00RK770EA|3|Would have rated higher, but about a month in the right lower hook snapped on its own.  May have been due to summer heat, but it's the first time this has ever happened.
B00AC5S23U|5|Awesome
B001RBLDB6|5|Perfect and exactly what I was looking for
B00LHVUGXM|4|Very good product, just to expensive,
B006JGH6LU|5|KOOL LUV IT
B004RCXALS|5|Great product
B000FQ7R32|5|Exactly like the original (except new).
B005YP5HHM|5|The key worked just fine but wouldn't you know that I found my spare set of keys a few days after the replacement arrived. I now have an extra, extra. Thanks for the timely delivery.
B004W9094M|1|Very bad quality, barely fit my 2000 Toyota Celica GT
B00B51VXIG|5|Outstanding Purchase!
B001JL42L2|1|Awesome
B00062YUY4|5|It really does the job -- adds a little kick to the old mustang ---92 LX --Notch --- SUPER !!!!
B001GH5PGK|5|I purchased this leveling kit for my 2005 Toyota Sequoia. It was a perfect fit and gave my Sequoia a strong stance. After installing it I put 285/70/17's on it which raised my Sequoia a total of 2&#34;.<br /><br />I highly recommend to all the Sequoia owners out there.
B000KZ20HG|5|What a great buy! I programmed it in less that 5 minutes and saved a ton of money by not buying through a dealer. Thanks so much!
B007Y1PP4E|5|Put this in my 2013 Impala LT (06 to 13 body style) and let me be the first to say, definitely a noticable diffrence, car is more responsive and if you listen closely you can here the airfilter doing its job (though it whistles when on the gas but its not bad enough for you to really notice and I believe its normal)
B00J3NPOI8|1|Horrible quality, ripped on first use.
B00OK0BPEG|3|cheap plastic, breaks too easy
B0056IJYBW|5|Item arrived new and as advertised.<br />Side note: Crashing motorcycles isn't fun. Don't do it.
B00N31NBCW|5|Bought this for my husband...he loves it!
B00N12RQW4|5|Love it. Good quality and child's play to install.<br />My itty bitty car got attitude. Makes me smile every time I look at it.
B0028321V8|5|Perfect for my 2012 Rogue!  Watched a 22 second YouTube video to see hands on how to install and it was easier than easy.
B00A71IJTG|5|Matches BMW Z4 look Fantastic.
B00GHT5BM0|5|Easy install, works great!
B000LOI69C|5|Just what I needed.  Heavy duty for sure.
B00RDOC7WA|5|Customer Service: Amazing response time to questions I had. I emailed the provided link on Wellvisors.com and heard back within an hour. Professionalism and attentiveness is key and they provided that to me.<br /><br />Product: Simple, quick, and easy installation of the visors for my IS 250. I had some on my car prior to purchasing this product, and WellVisors is much more sleek and its color matches my car perfectly. Installation took about 30 minutes and it was well worth it. I have no complaints about my visors. The price is very decent, and honestly, the ones I had on my car before wellvisors was a LOT more expensive and it didn't really hold up to its price or name. I'm so happy my husband found this site!<br /><br />I would definitely refer WellVisors to my family and friends. Products are well worth the price and not to mention, the easy installation.
B000C57LX2|5|Saved me a few hundred vs. getting few leaf springs.  Raised my rear end a few inches.  Handles awesome.  Combines quadracoil technology with leaf springs to give a superior product.
B0073HTV76|3|I installed a v meter on the load side. With 2 radios on recieve, it supplies just 12.2v from a fully charged 105ah agm battery.  Not good!  That drop makes a big difference in tx output.  65w radio is down to 45w.  It does keep the bu battery charged.  Gets hot (120ish) when charging a low battery.  If you intend to use this for e comms, it would be a good idea to have jumpers to bypass this thing.  Or better idea, spend a little more and get the power werx charger.
B00NZ8QTG8|5|good quality. Great price. Fantastic seller.
B00KQXKG46|5|Better price than equal lights from an ag dealership.
B00BH110LY|5|Fast and easy to install. Very satisfied
B00RK7EZTI|4|The key chain hole on my kept broke, so I need something that will keep my keep to the rest of my keys. This was a little loose, but I put a spot of glue in there and it holds my key in tight. Not looking forward to the day I have to get my key out of the thing, but it works! The case is cute.
B00310TBI8|4|good well made solid glasses,easy to change lens, they were a little bigger than i would have liked but they did say oversized!
B004L9RPN6|1|It appears to be the wrong size and does not mention that I have to drill into my outboard in order to make this work very in happ at this time I will install it and let you know later how it performs on the water and it comes with no instructions
B00MBB9YWG|4|Nice product,  decently loud.  Won't hear much over about 60 with loud pipes, about 70-75 without. Stickers are a hint flimsy though.
B000C9KOFU|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B006X8CO8O|2|grill looks great but there was nothing for the supplied hardware to fasten to. I had to install some steel strapping
B006FSUFX8|5|Great key it worked perfectly on my car.
B00473V668|5|GREAT
B004PLAGEK|1|i purchased this kit because its supposed to be a complete kit. mine is missing all the fuses. i was really counting on this. Looks like im not the first person that this happened to.
B007HRYD20|5|Works well
B005NYDT7Y|1|Bulbs cost too much and one burned out within 1 week
B00EQ2WDVM|5|everything hooked up great
B00JIEX722|5|Work great! Much brighter AND whiter than the factory incandescent wedge bulbs in my 2009 ZX6R headlight assembly.
B00MB0E1WK|3|The fabric gets fuzzy. Pieces of the yarn come off. Could use a sweater shaver.
B0098FHR6S|5|Great buy!
B001LL9UQ2|5|Tightens down nicely on the latch to secure it open or closed.  Appears hard to defeat.
B0040LRQ9S|5|look good, cheap price, comfortable, will buy it again If mine gets ripped
B00AWPO4SC|5|They look absolutely amazing on my bike! I highly recommend getting these! I'm about to order a set for my other gsxr.
B002GTK8K0|5|They look absolutely amazing on my bike! I highly recommend getting these! I'm about to order a set for my other gsxr.
B005A7ALOI|5|exact match to my 2007 gixxer 600 very pleased that it is REALLY OEM !
B00JUQFVX6|3|It was a real stretch to get the straps around a Honda Pilot's passenger and driver's seats due to the wide width of the seats.  It's doable but doesn't look great with the straps really pulled tight.
B00AWRVTYM|5|It's a MUST HAVE for any rider taller than 5'9&#34;.  Very nice hardware and easy to install.
B00HMDTDEM|5|Great value for what I paid for it.  Works well on my Suzuki DR200SE.
B000ALG86E|4|It's more lightweight than I would like, but it fits my car very well and stays on through heavy winds. In order to keep my car cool and clean, I bought three of these and treat them like one car cover made from three layers. One layer alone wouldn't last long through summer, as when the roof of the car gets hot, the material suffers and falls apart more quickly. Having those extra layers keeping the roof of the car cool solves the problem. I find this to be a far superior solution to buying one more expensive, heavier car cover - I've tried those and they start to disintegrate as soon as the summer sun hits my car.
B000CSZIXY|5|Not easy to install, but works well and closes the window firmly against the rubber seal.
B0036VRQ70|5|Had a 95 Camry 4-Cylinder that was ran dry due to a cracked radiator. This in turn caused an excessive amount of coolant to end up in the oil thanks to a leaky (blown?) head gasket. On a whim, I decided to try this out just for the sake of it, and was extremely impressed by the overall performance. Fixed the steam out of my tailpipe, coolant in the valve cover, and the extremely rough idle that required brake+gas when at a stop.
B00NQ8FD1Y|2|Conductor and insulator are good quality. The negative, blue end is a copper conductor, but the positive, clear end (silver wire) is copper clad aluminum. Product description did not state this.  Copper-Clad Aluminum (CCA) is impossible to tin and solder and would not wet no matter what flux I used. I'm afraid I have to use a different cable for my application.
B00N1YS4ZU|5|Great product
B00UO2D6BO|5|Works perfectly for a great price couldn't beat it
B00MGI60RQ|5|Best deal in town. Every led worked.
B000CN5GEA|5|New in box, as described.
B000WJX3R6|5|Great price and product!! Easy prep work.
B00V4049K2|5|I was skeptical, as most people are, of dropping thirty bucks on something like this based purely on claims. We all know companies will solicit positive reviews and so forth. I was tired of going through Two Febreeze Vent Fresheners every month (seventy-two bucks a year, plus tax).<br /><br />The day after I put this in my car, I noticed it right away... nothing. Not a bad &#34;nothing&#34;. I mean no smells at all. I'm a smoker, the car I recently got has cloth seats, smells get embedded in the fibers and stick around. Not now. This thing completely neutralizes them.<br /><br />This was money well spent. When it runs its course next year, I will be buying another right away.<br /><br />If you're reading this, you're obviously interested. Buy it.
B005HYAIOW|5|It maybe a bit premature to rate this product. I've had it less than a month?...  The original belt lasted about 9k miles, I had it replaced after it blew and left me stranded. I had a scooter shop replace it but to my surprise the belt they put in lasted about 2.5k miles. I purchased two of these and replaced it myself. It was quite easy and if you do a bit of research you will discover you don't need to take your gears apart to replace the belt. I did feel my bike moves a bit smoother and quieter. At least for the first month. Stay Frosty
B000CN5AFA|5|followed directions everything worked great
B00B6CTPH0|5|Glad to have the spoiler I wanted. Instal was super easy.
B00QRHDIPY|4|Living in Hawaii and with beach so close yet, no parking. So I use my moped. Sometimes, I don;t use it for weeks on end. The battery dies as I installed an alarm. Now, with this battery maintainer, I need not worry about a dead battery.
B000BUOSGG|3|Would probably work best for just one or two people.  It's small, portable and easy to clean so it fits perfectly for light camping.
B00OACB9NQ|2|Umm... I counted 11 pieces in my package. And what I received looked ok but I still struggle with the fit. Had to make adjustments. I really tried... I'm also a bit disappointed .
B00M0OSGCI|5|Looks very much like stock pegs.
B00C70TSMW|1|Please take my advice and DO NOT USE THIS GARBAGE.bought a bottle and put it in my semi truck radiator,didn't drive ten miles till my truck started overheating,wound up having to get new radiator and have the entire cooling system flushed...do not use any type of radiator sealer unless it is an absolute necessity to get you off the side of the road and even then i would use it sparingly...there is no magic fix in a bottle,will cause a lot more problems later on...if your radiator is leaking,do yourself a favor and do one of two things-take it to a radiator shop for repair or replacement...you're only prolonging the inevitable by using a so called &#34;miracle in a bottle&#34;.
B00K1N43R2|5|Really cool, the best and  luxurious cushion I bought.
B00MYDKJG6|5|We're received early, worked as advertised ,good product.
B000CITK8S|1|The charger is supposed to be &#34;smart&#34; but will not at all charge 12V batteries that are completely depleted, as stated in the manual as well as determined by application.<br /><br />I purchased a cheaper charger at Wal Mart with a higher amperage for quicker charging as well as the ability to charge 6V batteries.<br /><br />Overall, I can't see the hype about this little guy.
B008CPUGMW|3|They work the way they're suppose to except 1 broke putting it in The positive line popped out and wouldn't lock back in but still was able to make the connection just needed to motivate it do it, alsoca very tight fit 99 f150 I also ordered 2 sets, one day apart, one came from california and the other came from florida...
B00GN6U3NY|1|Seemed like good quality sticker. However upon trying to apply it the letters kept coming apart. This is a peel and stick sticker. Not one with a backing on it you press down and then pull off. So many bubbles I ripped it off and through it away. Not sure how so many people have good reviews. It was NOT easy to install.
B000R3WQPM|5|HAS WORKED WELL FOR MANY YEARS
B005NJ6A9I|5|This filter was an exact fit and I was glad I was able to purchase on amazon.  Very convenient.
B00QZHQF9M|5|i love this
B000BQWLE6|5|Perfect for taking in my RV when visiting campgrounds. Stores away easily.
B00BRHM8FA|2|Okay, now I'm pissed. It's taken me 4 hours to try to figure out what to do, on updating this because these idiots think everyone still uses PC. So I'm stuck with a older version of super chip because they don't think.
B00NIW5BOW|5|Nice sticker,seeing Rat Fink is a trip back to the 60's.About the size of a saucer.
B000BNKTZ2|4|This is one of the better tonneau covers on the market. Highly recommend .
B0002T8FIS|5|have used for many years and it works.  buying through Amazon saves you some money
B00YML13OU|4|a must have for young drivers
B000Y1B08G|5|Love our new plates.  One for each of us.  The C and the Bear are awesome!
B00PYK55VK|3|Not much scent. And I had them struck in every available vent. Sorry, I really wanted it to work.
B002P95MYS|3|Actual mirror in case is loose and flops going down highway.  Just not worth jumping through the hoops to get a new one or refund. Won't buy from again. Pretty simple quality control that was a total failure
B000AP57V2|5|I did not bought it on amazon. However, I want to write a review about this item. I have a BMW X5 e53 3.0i 2004. I bought this item about a year ago. This item increases acceleration power and in normal driving style consumption L/100km decreased about 2.5L on highway. Max combined consumption of my car now is  12L/100km (70 % city, 30 % highway).
B000BQKBP2|5|Fits perfect . Seems to help cleaning ,and is easy to use .
B00QLIOFBA|5|Perfect match with my lug nuts, you can hardly tell they're locks!  And the spline key set up gets far better grip and leverage than the ones I had with just the end of the lock keyed.  High quality and easy to use!
B00IMO7XUG|5|Thank you
B000C3YTGQ|5|Excellent....
B00IKKS4W8|5|jacks fit great went right on with no problems. thanks alot.
B0048EG5W6|5|These mats for my Nissan Murano 2010 perfectly! I couldn't believe how exact the fit was. Makes my newly paid off vehicle feel brand new
B000COMXCM|3|It's a great idea, but poorly designed.  The elastic section that's supposed to easily slide over a lug wrench is way to small.  It might slide over a very thin one, but forget it if your lug wrench is more than 3/8&#34; thick.  I got around it by putting a carabiner through it and clipping it to my wrench.  A zip tie or  Velcro cable strap would work too.  Great idea though.
B00OU67Z80|5|Great light!
B001J5Y2E0|4|It worked, the pads were sticky on both sides.  You stick stuff with it.  I was easily able to cut them into smaller strips for niche uses around the house.  The main thing I bought these for, to stick a 4 port usb charger for my accessores, has stuck extremely well.  A couple other uses, such as for my usb hub on my desktop computer, haven't worked as well due to the constant pull of cords in and out of it I guess.<br /><br />Oh yeah and did I mention it is sticky?
B00HQZC4YC|3|The tips themselves look good; I'm giving it three stars because the picture is misleading.I wanted a black tip and expected the clamp to be black, as it shows in the pic. Nope - got a slightly corroded bright clamp with both tips. If the MBRP tips weren't overpriced (at twice the price of these), I'd send them back just on principal.
B003H8REKQ|5|Love the look
B002G47GE6|4|Blades arrived well packaged. One of them is however too long. I am unable to use the longer blade as its length takes it beyond the windshield. I am using only the shorter of the two.
B0077A87ZQ|5|Great cover, second one I've owned - glad they updated it so that the front lock keys to your ignition key. Very little leakage, great cover!
B009ZG8NJ0|4|Installation went as expected but some of the top of the leather split in places (very small), so I'm deducting a star from an otherwise great product.
B00DTCJRQ4|1|Didn't fit my Scorpion Sitng 440cc as it should've. Way to loose.
B007JMTSTQ|1|You get what you pay for.  First item was defective (seams were coming apart), second has me questioning how long it will last. Update - after about a month the cover is already begining to discolor/fade from the sun.
B00AAR8H9O|2|Simply amazing. Super easy to install and look great! I have them installed in my 2013 Subaru Legacy. Everyone that has seen them LOVES them. Update 10-03-16.... Drivers side has completely faded. Just looks like a round white light now. Guessing the lens faded out over time. I have had these on my car for just over a year. I hope the newer ones have fixed this problem.
B002KCWWFC|5|works well
B00WDSVEE8|4|The shades were delivered on time (a day early actually) and were just what I expected.  They fit fine and provide good sun blocking and shade control.  The flip up works great and they can flip up all the way to get completely out of your line of vision if needed.  I'm very satisfied with the glasses and feel they were a good bargain at the price.
B002R1C9Z4|5|Good 100%
B00PYRS8J4|5|Great Quality
B000R4JX9I|5|great item
B00KIHCHVU|5|For the folks that are complaining about the nozzle....as with any aerosaul can, when you finish spraying you need turn the can upside down and spray until it stops spraying paint then store it.  Otherwise it gums up on the tip and won't work properly when you go to use it again.
B0012PNV6C|1|Only came with one not two like it says
B000COXL3W|5|Verte good good
B000TV59EC|1|FYI - MADE IN CHINA!!<br /><br />Buy American!
B006TMM9V6|5|Product fit perfectly. Good quality for a Great price
B0001WTY0E|5|Fits our 2006 Honda Pilot really good.  Use magnets to make it even better.  We camped in it during the Oshkosh EAA Airventure 2015!
B00WHZXYRW|5|It looks fine but it is for future use so I will return when used to give a review
B00MAPJJEQ|5|As advertised
B00T9W255I|5|Great quality!
B00DCZP22G|1|Broke the first time I used it
B00J0VDYYE|5|worked great. shipped fast
B002304JRA|4|works great on black engine parts....deepens the color and adds shine
B0052SF0LO|5|I have purposely waited 2 years to review this product, as solar lights have the tendency NOT to work &#34;long term&#34;. This is a great product and after 2 years, they are still going strong. I have 7 of these. Highly recommend. Easy to mount, easy to set up to use different length of time for the light to stay on, how long you want it to stay on and what level of darkness that you want them to come on.
B003YLMPPA|5|I purchased this resister in December but didn't install for a few months until March as I waited for better weather.  It has worked well for the past several months in my 2006 Wrangler. The Fan Blower Motor Resistor in the car was totally burned out and the fan only worked on high.<br /><br />It was a little difficult to remove and replace - getting the wiring harness disconnected and getting one of the bolts out was slightly more challenging than anticipated.  Of course that has nothing to do with the form fit and function of this part.
B000C59WGQ|5|These tie rod ends work great and I like that they include a grease zerk.  I've had them on for a few months now.  They have started to show some surface rust so I would recommend painting them before installing.  Also, be sure to hit it with a couple pumps of grease at every oil change.
B0017OFS3C|5|needed for work, did the job, no issues with quality.
B00AUIAWU0|5|I laid down on this and pushed off the leg of my workbench to propel myself under the car and ended up in the neighbor's driveway. Okay - a bit of an exaggeration but this works great on smooth pavement. I just need to remember to keep the cord of my trouble-light out of the way. It is comfortable and sturdy. I just have to wonder why I didn't by it years ago (been using cardboard).
B00NHMAJ40|5|Bought this on a whim for an off-road project. Price was too good to resist. When you flip the switch it lights up the WHOLE world. Super bright and seems to be quite rugged so far.
B006N9GIB2|5|On time, and exactly what I expected.
B00HRMSU1K|5|It is very nice and very easily for install I did by myself<br />I am happy for my new lights Thanks
B0059HJZO6|5|Good product for the money and while small grease guns have their place, some jobs just need more.  I bought these to reload a small grease gun but don't think you're going to do a whole lot with them, they just don't have the capacity.  If you plan on doing several zerks then use a big gun.
B006RYSBAY|5|I love this sticker. People ask me all the time where I got it.
B00CNUABYK|5|I am a Veteran and I am proud to display this license plate frame. It looks good and will last a long time.
B00E5KGQFY|1|Smaller than expected and not printed correctly, so the points aren't even aligned with the corners. Really disappointed
B007LIA8JM|5|This is a really nice steering wheel cover.  It's a little bulky, but you get used to it quickly and it really is comfortable.
B001KQA9Z4|5|Working great.  My husband said it wasn't as difficult as he thought it would be to install on my 2004 Dodge grand caravan. Was able to do fairly quickly, compared to what he was expecting.
B00GURR4BK|1|Terrible product. The muffler end is very heavy and the welding is of very low quality. I had mine properly installed and less than two months it broke in half at the weld. I contacted Scooter-ATV Parts and they refused to give me a refund. I would advise against doing business with this company at all costs. They don't care about their customers satisfaction. Once you pay them, that's it they have your money and they will not refund for a defective product. Unbelievable how businesses like this survive. I had to file a claim against them on Amazon which is currently being reviewed.
B00DCXBEAW|4|Hey it's bright so maybe it will make it a tad more difficult for my wife to lose the car key. Adds a degree of protection to fob if it's dropped, that's good. Only negative it's a bit harder to pop the key open once the case is installed, it takes a very deliberate action.
B00TEA5PZC|5|Good quality. Bright and shinny.
B00RDMBTNA|5|Love the product!!
B00B9F424A|5|EXCELLENT, PERFECT FIT
B0002UEOLO|5|Anti seize is a must when working on cars with aluminum parts.
B00HFRQF28|5|This is a serious, high quality chain.  Very strong and smooth, impressive.  I bought this to replace an aging Tsubaki chain, and I was shopping amongst the major brands. I decided to try JT because of their reputation in the industry with sprockets, and also the price compared to similar offerings from the top chain makers.  I am extremely satisfied with this, installed last week, after 500 miles of HARD riding it feels superb.  I will update this review after a few thousand miles if need be, but as of right now I'm very impressed with the craftsmanship.  The steel they used is so tough, that I had a very difficult time pressing the rivets on the master link.  It was unreal, actually, and I used an extra heavy-duty riveter. I would not waste my time or effort trying to rivet the link with one of the cheaper, economy-type riveters. If that's any indication of the overall toughness of the chain, then I'd say this will be a 50k mile chain easily. As stated, it was a pain in the butt with my extra heavy-duty riveter, so plan on having a powersports shop rivet the link for you or do yourself a favor and order a HD one (I suggest a riveter rated for up to 630 chain) or you can just order a clip type master link.  Be sure to get the actual &#34;JT X1R&#34; clip master link, for proper fit (I tried a spare Tsubaki clip link that I had just to see if it would fit, and it was a bit too small)  The JT steel is thick.<br />Couple final thoughts:  If you are looking to lighten up your bike, this is not the best choice (Heavy-Duty = heavy weight).  However, if you are focused on durability and quality, this chain looks bulletproof to me, and nice fit & finish as well.  ***Will update review if need be, but I expect this chain to outperform!
B00062YJV8|5|Great product
B001YJ5CHM|1|This product was the worst purchase I have ever made. First they would not swell up properly and the metal nut on the inside would just move to the top of the bolt without swelling the rubber up. Second the bolt heads stripped under any sort of pressure. Third over-all quality was cheap and garbage. Threw them straight into the garbage after trying to get a couple of them to work.
B001DAHM0C|3|No base gasket!  Why a 2-cent part would be so hard to include is beyond me.  Rotor tip simply fell off inside the distributor somewhere along the way.  It looked used when I finally found it inside, with some charring on the tip like someone had returned it.  The cap wasn't used, however, and appeared to be OK.  The wires don't run through the grommet at the edge of the cap, they sit on top where the cap edge can press down on them and abrade the insulation, which is already showing signs of being clamped under the cap.  Fortunately, this part doesn't move once installed, so it's livable that way.<br /><br />The metal and gear and bearings appear just fine, just a shame no quality control on the rest of it.  Plan on replacing the rotor, just for peace of mind, in my opinion.
B0049IFX56|5|Work well, can not replace the battery because it is sealed. Once the battery dies you throw the thing away.
B000C7QGYU|3|it fit right in, only problem, it didn't come with the radiator cap!, you should include one with product,<br />my previous one wouldn't fit the plastic spout,,,also, the hoses I bought didn't fit, amazon, please refine your<br />auto part screen tool,and add more oem products please!!!!
B00HZ54H66|4|This went on great and looked great. The only problem is the fading that they list in all the reviews. Our bike is vintage in look so it looks ok on our bike but it looked better when it was the stark black that it starts out at. I wouldn't repurchase but it got the job done for now. It would be a five star if it would stay totally black.
B00IPS3IJO|5|Super easy to install and love the quality
B000O5EFNY|4|Does not have the sizes needed for aircraft instruments.  Otherwise a good set.<br /><br />Pay attention to the sizes listed.  You may find that it does not have what you need.
B00V2RZLKE|5|It looks absolutely amazing on my bike! I highly recommend getting this ! I'm about to order another one for my other gsxr.
B00NFFE4YA|1|First, this is good oil for VW vehicles that need 502.00/505.00 spec oil. My engine is a 1.9L TDI Diesel 'Pumpe Duse' engine.  The engine design has to have very specific oil because the camshaft lobes directly press the injection pressure valves and are under tremendous pressure (35,000 psi if I remember correctly). If you do research of VW approved oils for this car, one thing you will find in common, is the oil needs to meet the 505.01 VW requirement.  The reason I rated this product with one star, is they claim it meets the spec, but nowhere on the bottle does it say meets VW 505.01 spec.  This oil is claimed to be backwards compatible.  So 4,000 miles after using this oil, I started hearing an occasionally engine noise at low idle and cruise.  Maybe it's coincidence, I seen a lot of strange things in the automotive field.  I've been a ASE Master Tech for over 10 years and this is my personal vehicle.  I will be draining this oil early to try to save my motor.
B009U2UW70|5|Exactly what I expected. And shipped fast. 👌🏼
B0049DWIVS|5|got rid of engine light
B00029WVHY|5|Light and well made, especially for the low price.  Surprisingly, they are made in Taiwan and not China (typically a good thing). They are an outstanding value for the price and therefore I bought three to use in a cubicle setting.  For two bucks you really cannot go wrong.
B00YB5GAEA|4|The pros: low cost, re-chargeable light, certainly bright enough for all night biking uses. It's very small and easily fits in a pocket, which is good for people who live in cities, and re-attaching it is quick and easy. Also the light can be easily turned on from the riding position.<br />The one issue I had was that the coupling between the plastic housing for the light and the rubber strap may be insecure. My fix, which has worked for the last ~100 miles, was to keep the rubber strap on a relatively loose setting, and to apply a little bit of epoxy to the coupling.
B0054HNQ32|5|I was very pleased with product ,the price ,and the shipping. received my product before given arrival.
B005LXTOEY|5|What's a low-cost, high-quality product!<br />Very easy to install and everything fitted precisely. It is even pre-adjusted to the exact location of screw holes to attach the glass. Only 15 minutes to finish the installation job<br />Super product! Thank you very much
B00SO1YXY6|4|it works but I like boxs better
B00C3PL27U|5|Thank you
B0002TDUW4|5|I coated the bed of my 1996 Toyota T100 over the weekend.  I actually dIdn't get the product on Amazon, but the pricing is similar.  I LOVE HERCULINER!  My bed was scuffed maroon paint from 20 years of use and abuse.  I took my time cleaning the bed with the Sodium Triphosphate cleaner listed on the instructions...about $7.  Then I knocked all the gloss off with 120grit sandpaper...about $3.  (I tried a 1/4 sheet sander and the green stripping pads, but 120-grit, by hand, worked best for me.)  Then I wiped it down a couple of times with a damp rag and THEN wiped it all down with Xylol (also listed on the instructions)...about $8.  I wanted to coat the bed rails as well, so I taped everything off very carefully and got to work.  Note: I did not remove the tailgate.  I was able to get to all coatable surfaces without taking it off.<br /><br />First of all, Herculiner was thinner than I expected, about like paint, but strangely it sticks quite well when brushed or rolled on.  It doesn't drip or run much.  I brushed all the edged and corners and then used the roller on the bigger surfaces.  Included brush is low-end but get the job done.  Roller works extremely well!  It actually fills in nooks and crannies much better than I expected.  You can use the roller more than you think you will be able to.<br /><br />I allowed the first coat to dry for about 4 hours (almost completely), then placed two long strips of wax paper down in the bed and a long piece of plywood on top.  I used that as a runway to crawl back in and roll on a second coat.  No sticky mess...the wax paper kept the plywood (and me) from sticking.  This was my own idea and worked really well.  Sometimes I surprise myself.<br /><br />Right after the 2nd coat, I peeled off the tape while it was somewhat wet from the first and second coats, and it came off easily.  I was already amazed at the transformation.  The Herculiner hides everything...scratches, tiny rust spots where the bare metal was exposed (I actually ground these down to bare metal as part of prep).  Even little dents and knocks are hidden in the sea of crusty black coating!<br /><br />It dries so hard and sticks so substantially.  Granted, I just completed the job 72 hours ago, but I cannot stop looking at it.  I carried it over the top of the bed rails and tailgate.  The bed rails look awesome as I carried the liner down about an inch on each side.  Same with the tailgate.  I even hid a bunch of scratches above the tailgate handle by coating a little &#34;soul patch&#34; from the top of the gate to the handle.  Looks fantastic.  Great way to spend a Sunday and save like $400 over the retail spray-on liners.  Major improvement for my worse-for-wear 20-year-old truck.  now it looks almost as good as it runs, and finally I can change my ringtone to something other than the &#34;Sanford and Son&#34; theme.

B00E3PVEXU|1|It is too big and loose and does not fit the Traverse has indicated in product description.  Not in any way satisfied with product
B00SH1SN6C|5|Has already saved me much time and money. Jump started my 2003 Pontiac Bonneville three times without a recharge. So amazing and convenient! Will never be without one again!! Amazingly easy and the peace of mind is worth it! Purchase one for yourself and for anyone else you don't want sitting on the side of the road hoping someone will stop to jump them off.
B00NBGHMTM|4|I like it.  A bit short for my Ford Focus but does fit and stay on in windy conditions.  Thumbs up
B00RW67VRA|5|Very nice
B00JYFKRAK|5|Using this on my four wheeler, since i wanted a heavy duty chain. I cut the chain to custom length, and it's working very well for me so far.
B000EQJUG0|5|springs work great. the old ones were weak & the shoes were draging, cocking & binding on the drum
B012EZ9G2G|4|The light were great. Only problem was the high and low beams had been wired backwards. Still a simple fix.
B00Z646LSK|5|Good product got it on time
B0058WXNOK|1|Not very good. I followed the directions explicitly,  and the adhesive did not stick very well. The patched area is already cracking again.
B00C6JC8S0|5|Fits my 2010 Forester. Looks super cute and feels like cloth which is a lot better than my steering wheel itself.
B006D9W5FA|5|It's just simple and works great.  Screw one on, move to the next tire, screw it on; rinse and repeat until all 4 are on.  Then, check the tire pressure of the first one.  When it gets to the desired tire pressure, unscrew it; and work your way back around.  It's fast and easy.
B00VMMALKY|5|It is exactly as described. Love it!
B00P5YOU3O|5|Excellent product
B00YI3IGA6|4|This is easy to use. Just pull down over car door . It covers the whole window unlike those little window shades. You can also open the window and let the air circulate through.It keeps the temperature in the car down .It is made of a stretchy mesh that you can wash if you need to. It fits the maximum of 44.3 inches by 20 inches.It is a very great idea,it comes with 2 covers so you can so both windows.I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.
B000F285EG|5|Must have for the Hi-Lift Jack.
B002NUABUO|5|I purchased this stuff to treat the rust that had started on my trailer hitch and part of my under carriage of my 4X4 Trailblazer; in just a few minutes I could see change in the metals color, Now I am rebuilding my boat trailer and after 16 years, it has gotten beaten up and rust has started showing up in many areas. I will use this before I repaint my trailer. Good stuff.
B00473W5V8|5|Worked great!  Did as promised!
B000EQCYXG|4|Good filter for price.
B00KRAR4HA|5|GREAT
B0050EFR5E|5|We love this kit so far. We bought a used fifth wheel with a trashed awning. We figured as long as we have to pull the awning off to change the fabric might as well upgrade to the travel'r set. We use this with direct response kit. They work seemlessly together. This kit is not quick nor super easy to install. My wife and i did it by ourselfs however I recommend a third person if you can round one up. It took us about 6hrs start to finish with a few long breaks...(arizona heat is no joke).  Now that its installed it looks great and works awsome i would definitely do again our next rv!.
B000CQVOUM|5|Great
B000FZ5GRC|5|now I can tell I have fog lights very good product.
B00CMOYRXI|5|I've been using 303 products on my boat for the last 5+ years, both the Fabric Guard and Vinyl Guard give excellent protection. Keeps my covers from fading, and keeps my vinyl like new. But I wish the products where cheaper!
B003TK3T6A|4|So far this works great.  Really like to intensity and color
B000CODGXW|2|Actual tow weight is lower than advertised. I believe it had a 5000lb max vehicle weight, but product headlined as 12,000lb.
B009XQ656U|4|Arrived as advertised, fit perfect.  Only negative was that on a few edges the silver paint was sprayed on too thin, you can see black under the specs of silver
B00FLI1OAG|5|This shell worked perfectly. Simply pulled the chip from my old one and added it to this one and everything works fine.
B003YLIGQM|5|Easy install. If you're missing one or more speeds from your HVAC fan control, this is probably the cause.
B001JT3DYQ|5|I like it, not too loud & the sound is perfect
B001AIZ5HY|5|Follow the instructions to the letter and you will get the results you are seeking. What more can you ask of a product?
B00CAUG7E6|3|Good
B004137VKO|5|As advertised, does what it's supposed to do.  I recently replaced the driver side sliding door handle on my 1998 sienna and it was easy to install.  This time around, I actually managed to replace only the handle, not the entire housing.  It took a little bit extra work, but the original part does have a better gasket to seal and I was able to salvage the original color as much as possible for my wife's 2000 sienna.  Either way I kept the housing just in case.  First time around it took me 20 minutes and this time it took me about 8 minutes.
B00KHTAI7E|5|Perfect
B0000AY69V|5|BEST one I've tried yet. Easy to ring out and really absorbent.
B009XIU6SG|1|Very disappointed I thought everything came that was in the picture did not I can't finish the job this is very upsetting
B0093QKNS6|5|I just installed this in my 1994 Toyota pickup, did have to do a tweak to the wires but total time spent probably 15 minutes. The first time in 10 years the interior light has worked, Yeah! Very happy so far with product, arrived sooner than I expected.
B0016KA9PY|5|Don't know why the others are so expensive.
B0050Z9QBY|5|Great product and extremely great customer service
B00N9HOWQY|5|Works great! Can't believe it took me so many years to buy this wrench!
B00ISRDFQ8|3|Looks cool, but it too tiny to use for an ashtray.
B00PQKMBC4|3|They look nice and they effectively cover the hubs; however, they don't fit flush to the wheel, so they aren't quite deep enough for my 17.5&#34; wheels.  They do the job though and they stayed in place for a 3000 mile trip that I made right after they arrived at my home.  Update:  Went on a trip to Rocky Point, Mexico and lost two of them on the drive.  They are held on by friction so I guess the bumpy road in either southern Arizona or highway 8 in Mexico caused two of them to fall off.
B00VW0BAVU|2|I just don't get any reception with this antenna, guess its just to small
B00JIARQ1O|4|Works perfectly, as advertised, last about 2 to 3 years. I'm on my 4th on my 2001 4Runner, which is about normal. Easy to install if you follow the instructions.
B00CH6T18C|5|Good product.  Easy to apply and does the job quite well.
B00H2UYXZY|4|The running boards are very much like the factory installed.  The only negative I saw was that it would have been much better if instructions were included.  I managed to find the same online and the company that installed them for me is experienced with these type installations.  Otherwise, I would say it would have been very difficult to install.  The savings, as opposed to having the dealership, were considerable.
B00MJ46ZS6|2|This cover fit my SUV okay and it provides protection from falling tree waste, but it is CHEAP - The outside plastic portion of the cover rips very easily. When we pull the cover over our SUV we must be very careful to hold the cover at the sewn edge. If we accidentally put our fingers into the outside plastic, it rips right through. Our cover is becoming more and more ripped and patched with tape and that is being careful and after only 4 months time.<br /><br />I have no doubt that I will need to buy another better cover in the near future and I would NOT recommended this cover to anyone.
B000PUJWEU|1|Came damaged and had to modify it to make it assemble correctly
B00FF4814S|1|It would not hold my coffee cup.  I had to wire it on to the air vent.
B00I15AW5E|5|Just what I needed and it works too! Better priced than most autoparts stores in my area
B000RW1XCK|5|Awesome stuff.  But don't get it on your fingers, it will stain them for days!!
B004WO1A0Y|5|Package a bit beat up but the product was flawless
B002QS0JFA|5|It's windshield wiper spray.  Not a whole lot to say here.
B00651C9OI|4|Good quality, bends on highway. Restores to original shape.
B00E97PTN8|5|Great fit. Improved my grip. Recommend them to any lifter.
B001C6Q8CA|5|Perfect OEM quality.
B00GSAUHB8|5|love it...fits perfectly and works great!
B00K16FC7Y|5|Very good product.  Been using  for awhile now,many thousands of miles. Very good product. Have used several synthetics promising ,well,you name it. I'll stick with this one
B00WXO6WQW|4|would have gave a five star if a little more blue but other then that grate!
B00B00F8OW|2|They do the job but quality is a bit cheap
B00U5OMBJ4|5|Very bright for the cost... Great value
B0053TVKT8|5|Does what it's suppose to do as advertised. Provides a multi purpose capability for hitching towable apparatus compatible with my UTV Polaris 900 ranger which is a full sized model vehicle. Did come with hitch pin for securing to hitch mount.
B00SU0W2C6|5|This product works as designed.  I have used is several times already and have found that the readings are fairly accurate.
B00WIT04PM|5|Bought these clips for a trim panel on a 2003 Pontiac Vibe. Fit was perfect.
B00MOIRFFE|5|Great fit! Works awesome, highly recommend !
B00G9QJ6KY|5|Fit properly, works fine.
B00J8P083W|5|Worked perfectly on my 04 BMW 330 ci.
B004I16NYY|5|Just as described.  Fits great.
B002H99GJI|1|Wrong application,
B00390RKVA|1|The lock broke immediately after installation. Don't waste your time & money on RR.<br />Bought a from a different manufacturer and love it.
B000AY5EL6|4|It was a gift. It was what he wanted
B00S5LPHMW|1|My car spent 90% of its time in a parking garage so I loved this frame at first. But after 3 weeks of being outside, the white background turned yellow.
B001GKSQRW|5|Worked great, so far.  Used it to take UTV to Colorado this summer (1500 miles round trip).  No issues.  Easy to install.
B004B159MI|5|Sturdy and beautiful. With this frame and my vanity plate SWEEET on order now I can be assured that my husband will never drive my Miata convertible :-)
B006VFEJJQ|4|Purchased this battery since my 2007 Prius showed a RED triangle with exclamation, paid for 1 day shipping for total price of $175 w/tax which was about $50 cheaper than other major retail auto storefronts. Called couple of retail stores to price-match Amazon but they refused. Oh well.<br /><br />The Optima battery came charged but it only showed 12.6 v and I was hoping to see around 13v. This was made in Mexico. Lots of videos on Youtube on how to install. Installation is a breeze if you have simple tools.<br /><br />Overall, this beats the price charged by Toyota dealers for OEM battery(About $300). Now, have to see how long this last - am hoping atleast 7-8 years, however the warranty is only for 36 months - so don't forget to register on optimabatteries.com<br /><br />This is a perfect fit for 2007 Prius although you have to nudge the handle which is hard plastic around.
B002LEK7SS|5|Heavy and great quality. Looks great on my car!
B00L4TF32G|5|Great uv protectant
B000EDSSDE|5|Price was great, and you can't have too many of these little devices; they're very handy.
B00L7E80IW|5|Comes in handy in the car.
B003IOITIK|1|I purchased a Actron CP9550 and it worked fine for a few months until 30-45 days out of short warranty period. It was my second Actron scanner which had early failure. Also it would not list history or previous faults which is important to a dealer buying used vehicles where typical check engine lights are turn off without the indicated repair being done. The check engine light returns at 40 to 60 miles after the auction sale has been completed. I will avoid any Actron products because of short product life.
B000C59Z72|5|great product
B000MDZLR2|4|Fit as advertised would buy it again
B00IG369GM|3|I thought the material was going to be thicker, and it could do with some velcro along the sides to keep them down on the carpet.
B00FC221PI|5|Work great and are super bright. Very helpful customer support
B0027UREVO|4|A lil slow on shipping,but all n all,bolted right up and works great with the 2500# warn winch,is a lil time consuming to get it all installed
B0039YGZDK|4|With cats you need to be protected...both for their sake and your electronics!
B00FJXYDU6|5|perfect. exact fit
B001O0AMNK|5|they are awesome and a great price too....if i ever need more this is the place ill get them
B00062YKQW|5|If you not have K&H you are missing out.
B000VW4DVO|5|Perfect  fit. Cured the deth wobble.
B0016ZBP1Q|5|worked on my Primo hot water side of my 5 gal. water cooler
B000NVW1LM|5|Initially it didn't stop my gearbox seal leakage completely; even after 4-5 hours of driving. However, the leakage decreased steadily while on my holiday (with very hot, thus thin, oil) - and unlike before I used the product, there are NO drops on the ground whenever I park my bike!<br /><br />Also, it seems that motorcycle wet clutches are happy with this additive. I can't recommend this product enough - from using several litres of oil per 1.000 miles, I barely use a litre now!<br />Thanks for this wonderful product!!
B00R3LYF7S|5|I love this product, I've gifted it several times!!. Not only is it even better in person, but it is high quality and accurately depicted. I would highly suggest!
B002XLHUQG|4|Easy to install.  Takes out the aft out of RV
B004I0FBCA|5|Looks to be of good quality, and is a good price.
B0018F3MP6|2|I know a mechanic very well who works on dirt bikes, ATVs and motorcycles all the time. Having done so he has often replaced the batteries over the years and what brand does he always buy? Yuasa<br /><br />The 1985 Yamaha XJ700 Maxim I own needed a new battery and I buy this product which is a perfect fit according to the Yuasa website. The fresh new battery did fit perfect, my mechanic even assisted me in the installation and it ran great. That was until the 4 month mark when out of the blue the bike does not start. The bike is 30 years old, must of blown a fuse, something got loose or maybe this or maybe that. However; nothing was a matter with the bike so we pull out this moderately used battery and hook it up to a battery charger/indicator. It blinked red for half a day indicating that this battery could no longer hold a charge. I did not leave it running, I did not leave it out in the rain, I did not crash it, it's not leaking acid and I have the only set of keys so nothing could have happened to this battery that makes any sense for it to just fail accept for it was faulty.<br /><br />I want to believe they make good; durable batteries because I've seen them last for years in a dirt bike. Maybe something just went completely wrong but there really was no reason for it to run perfect one day and then the next for it to be absolutely beyond hope dead. This is why for my next battery purchase I will probably avoid Yuasa after this poor experience they have given me to really make me feel like I wasted my money.
B001G04V0I|4|Work reasonably well.  Seem to leave a film on the windshield at times.
B000234IT4|5|Very good
B00RCBERJK|4|These bulbs do NOT work with CK sockets as stated, but can be modified to do so AT YOUR OWW RISK.  Basically the two inner leads need to be swapped. This can be accomplished by straightening out all leads, separating the bulb from the base, swapping the two inner leads making sure they don't touch as this will cause a short, reinserting the bulb into the base, and bending the leads back into their channels.  Worked perfectly on my 2011 Honda Odyssey with CK socket.
B00E6QODP2|5|Great fit and cheaper than OEM
B009EZ8D4M|4|Fit perfectly
B00K6CKZ16|4|REALLY GOOD DID EVERYTHING I NEEDED IT TO
B0002JMF98|2|not the right part, returned
B00JGJH8RY|5|Excellent
B000M5JTKA|4|Good price for product!<br />Used for awhile.  Had issue with fuel system.  Stopped using product.  Not sure that it had any impact on truck.
B0016GRTVU|1|Scratch my vehicle not made good
B002VE3VHW|5|Excellent!  Much less expensive than others I have purchased in the past and works even bwttrt
B001TYMK1S|5|good
B005UTS6FW|5|Bought my first set and figured they would not last long, I was use to paying $50 for windshield wipers. However, they lasted through the whole winter and spring here in NY. I purchased a second set after 9 months.
B00NWGZ3A6|4|seems to work, only potential drawback is that the leads are attached, can't be replaced if damaged.
B001GF7MFE|5|Live in Arizona, it truly is worth the money steer wheel and seat belt aren't on fire when I get into car.
B00J52LJNG|5|easy to use
B00KIC860Q|4|Good product a little difficult to apply witht the double stick tape, but works fine.
B000CIY4AM|5|Wonderful product
B00YXOZBOE|5|Did the job and was shipped quickly...what else could you ask?
B0016KFVLG|5|love it thank you
B001EOV492|5|Heavy duty and worked perfect. I Towed my old heavy horse trailer with 1600 pound of cow thru the NC mountains. No problem.
B0009IK5TO|5|Good product...good price.
B001LHVOVK|4|Basic scanner but very useful
B000N9PRKG|4|The part worked fine and was an easy installation.
B001Q7VRVM|5|This is, in my opinion, the best cleaner/conditioner you can get for your leather furniture.  It is also great for the seating in my vehicle.  It is rich, but doesn't leave the leather greasy, just supple and clean.  It also smells good, just like new leather.
B006G14FK8|5|We have a bunch of motorcycles in our stable, a few of them use AGM batteries, and we found out the hard way that regular Battery Tenders don't do well with this new battery technology, so we're slowly switching everything over to these new CTek charger/maintainers.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the quality of these units, and also with CTek's customer service. I had some questions before I purchased our first charger and my email was answered promptly (within an hour) and with exactly the information I needed to make an informed decision.
B001DKV5H8|4|For long time i hear this and that from people i have met. I had to try this for myself and bite the bullet. so far it had been almost a month. the<br />shifting was smoother and felt a fraction of improvement as the we move into the cold weather. i will know for sure. read reviews and i decided to invest in it.
B000KXA6HY|1|Won't pull anything!!!
B0009V1WR0|2|did not fit my motorcycle wheel way to small
B000CO7EBM|1|Horrible quality.  The black accent is half missing in parts.  The face as scratches and pits from manufacturing and packaging.
B008G32ZPG|4|Make sure your truck is wired for the turn signal and heater features.  My 2008 Tundra wasn't.  The motorized option functions perfectly.<br />The plug on mine only had 3 pin/wires.  I believe the tow mirrors have 5 pins/wires.  This is easy to check if you remove the top corner plastic piece from door panel.  It easily snaps on and off.  This will expose the electrical plug.  I think this should be added to the description,  My truck was not factory wired for these options.  I didn't need the heater, and can do without the turn signals also since I didn't have either on old mirrors anyway.<br />I'm pretty sure I could find the factory wires inside door panel if I cared to take the time to find them and add them to the plug.  Not that important to me.  If your factory mirrors had the turn signal feature adding these mirrors shouldn't be a problem.
B0091OE6K6|5|This works great! It keeps the seat belt from rubbing up against your neck as described.
B00OOY12EQ|3|It works okay.  A bit awkward.
B00T3PPBMU|5|Perfecto fit great product fast shipping thanks
B007265GMW|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00HTUDHYU|2|Steel beads won't go in core wortha crap ended up breaking bead and throwing in
B013CN9TV2|5|I bought this set of microfiber cloths because I use cloths around the house for most all of my cleaning needs. I rarely use paper towels for clean ups as I find them too expensive to use when I can use a cloth once or twice, wash it and re-use it. When I removed this set of microfiber cloths from the packaging, my first thought was how soft they were. I also was impressed with their size.  They are a full 16 inches by 16 inches! That's a really nice size cloth to use for any type of clean up! I wash dishes by hand, so I used the first one after dinner last night. I really like that the cloth was absorbent and easy to wring out.<br />The second time I put one of the cloths to the test was today in cleaning the bathroom mirror. It preformed exceptionally well: leaving no streaks or lint behind.<br />This is a great set of microfiber cloths, I highly recommend them to anyone.<br />I received these cloths at a reduced rate for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.
B0000AXPDU|3|received quick and is what is advertized.  had it on spare tire for 2 months, showing signs of rust spots.  keep it oiled
B005GYA6FY|5|Fit 2003 scrambler
B00FC22E00|5|Good product. However my bulb blew on the driver side as soon as I powered them on.
B000CIMDAU|4|Arrived as promised. High quality materials. Easy installation. Friend with a lift helped. Took less than two hours including replacement of cat con. Only minor issue was packing. One flange was slightly bent, easily corrected. Only flaw in whole process. Exhaust looks and sounds great.
B002SZZ44M|5|car feels gr8 m8 good r8 i think
B0035AMPFK|5|On time and as described.  Hope I never need it. :)
B001GAAUCG|5|Fits perfectly. Thick enough, but could be another 1/8&#34;. I would say buy it.
B00KKNIY00|5|Love It!!  Colors are bright and it looks just as advertised.
B001P2JONQ|5|Perfect Fit.
B000BZAA6I|5|Purchased to replace the weeping pinion seal on my '95 GMC Sierra 4x4. Terrific replacement. Once I got the pinion nut off (which required an air-powered impact wrench) swapping the old seal for the new one was a breeze, and cured the leak. Tips: apply a thin coat of sealant around the body of the seal, to seal it tightly to the differential housing; and apply a generous amount of oil or grease to the seal itself (once in place) to prevent it from being dry when you start driving, after completing the repair.
B0024E6ZW2|5|Perfect! Arrived on time and does what it said it would.
B00EPPAPYC|5|Just as described, nice looking and very heavy, I'm sure they will last for years
B00CMR79H6|5|Fits Great !
B00T0XAV16|5|Great tint. I installed during a rain storm and barely any light. I like the way it looks with all the bubbles and tears I caused. If you want a near perfect installation you must have a helper and plenty of spray soap. Also, you should take your door panels off for perfect fit. I did not care about the messy job I did because I did not want anyone to envy me and I wanted the police to see a sloppy job so that they do not get jealous and ticket me for illegal tint. Read surah Al Kahf ( the Cave) in the Quran and you will see how Khidr taught Moses a lesson by making a hole in the boat. A defect sometimes helps keep evildoers away, just like the boat with a hole kept the greedy evil king from aquiring the boat for himself. So go ahead and tint your windows yourself and feel great about it no matter what faults you may have.
B006SYNF9K|2|too long for sedan
B0006SH4PA|5|This is the best stuff i have ever used.  Great Shine!  Love it.
B00V5YOBFA|5|Really nice product and super bright. Arrived in the time the seller estimated.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Works great. I like it more now that I've learned how to fold it back up. The first few times I got so frustrated that I just threw it in the back seat. There's a video on YouTube that will help you as it comes with no instructions.
B004Y4OYIM|5|Great Product.
B003Z49L2G|5|These are the only non ski goggles I have that don't fog up. They simply work each time everytime. They make you look like a bug, but thats the only draw back.
B004A61MAC|5|great product
B000C7S1L6|5|Received quickly. Boxed well. Great product
B000BQSIWK|5|I was able to restore my battery to health using this product.  Works great.
B006H82B1U|4|I have not installed them yet but they look good
B00390BS7C|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00WNM0R7Y|5|Hubby loved it but please take note that it does not come with the pin to lock it in place.
B0027FY8O0|5|Excellent these were on sale better than the ones nissan had in the car
B00KVO4RZY|1|Really bad piece of work - do not order - flims as if it's made in China ca-ca.
B0002SR7TC|5|GREAT PRODUCT, WILL MALE THE LOF EASY
B003BSB7PU|3|good
B00MQAGVZU|5|exactly as described
B001AVS7NK|5|Good product. It made my quad sport have more torque
B00HE66Q2Y|1|My car is a gorgeous, dark gold and this stuff is yellow. Now to figure out how to get it off!
B007BL4WPA|5|looked good
B00B3UWRE8|5|Perfect
B001EOV492|5|Perfect
B00BLDAQJ0|2|You get what you pay for.  I ride with my Jeep open most of the time. My Jeep is a soft top. I was concerned spending $100. for a more quality cargo liner that could easily be stolen. But with that being said....I had to do some modification to THIS cargo liner to make it weigh more---being open (top-less), this liner could just fly out. It doesn't weigh much at all. If your Jeep is a hard-top or you keep it covered, this mat is fine.
B0087Q8YA2|4|I got it in a hurry and it works just fine
B00KGIB960|1|got 3 not 1 worked
B005J6JRMM|5|For those keeping score, this will fit the 1997-2001 Toyota Camry.  I can't understand why the driver's side seat belt buckle is so often buried so far down in so many vehicles, especially since it's not the case on the passenger side.  It makes you wonder what is going through the mind of the auto designers.  Whatever--this is the solution.  Works great.  Wish I had thought of it years ago.
B000E2CVI8|4|The only issue I have with these is the nut; it is not very sturdy. Applying the correct torque specifications for my 2015 R1 strips away the nut on the end. It has some type of plastic coating that just pulls away when applying any significant torque. I emailed K&N saying the nut stripped and they said the R1 doesn't really need to have it torqued that much. WRONG. Any less torque on this oil filter causes a leak.<br /><br />However, K&N did send me 2 new oil filters so I am very pleased with that. Just be careful when applying high torque. If the socket isn't seated perfectly and completely perpendicular, it will strip the nut.
B00SXE4GI2|5|Good price and easy to put on car.
B003VAWPSQ|4|It's taken me 3 purchases, one return & one cancellation, but I have some info that you may find useful.  AMAZON 182904 is HappiJac FT CG07;  182910 is FT UT9; and 182906 is FT CG9.  Amazon does not put the HappiJac numbers in their description, but you can go to the HappiJac web site, use their search to find out what model goes with your vehicle, then match it with these numbers.  Hope this helps some out there.  It was frustrating for me, even called the customer service line to no avail.  At least AMAZON paid the return charges.  I haven't attached the kit to my truck yet, hoping all goes well.  It should, as HappiJac let me know what pieces I would need for my truck make & model.  Happy Camping!
B0055PD1H4|5|It's 3 weeks now with rain and sunshine and one car wash, my 2 cars look new. Very impressive. Thanks.
B00J8DPFKA|1|This ad was misleading. Supposed to be &#34;direct fit&#34;. It was TOO SMALL for my 2013 f150 superman/6.5 bed. What a hassle to return it and get another from another manufacture.
B0012WHBSO|5|I have a slow leak in one of my tires and its extremely handy to have this in the truck of my car.
B00K16FPO4|4|This product definitely works well, am happy with finally getting rid of that chalky grey/white look.  I noticed a couple of streaks several days later but it could be that I live a mile from ocean and the marine layer might be the culprit since I park outside.  Since I don't know for sure, am posting 4 stars but if I could, would give 4.5 stars.
B005N6Y5AW|5|love it!!!
B00912K9L8|5|This fits and functions excellent. Should be standard. Very high quality.
B00G27EYI4|5|I ordered with caustion as a previous review cited poor packaging. This arrived well protected and in great shape. It is more difficult to put on that anticipated but came out great. Sadly, I found out what the trick is only afterward. Everyone thinks my Fifth Wheel Toy Hauler is some sort of special Harley Davidson edition now.
B0081STS56|4|Directions need to show real world pictures vs the confusing diagrams for installation.
B003CJ927I|5|Great accessory for the battery tender.
B000M5PQAW|5|I have been using Stanadyne for 6 years and will not fuel up with out it.
B00S4J0HFC|5|I found one will dry about half of my car (a 2 door coupe), so I bought a second, but that should take care of the whole job. It really holds water well and doesn't leave the streaks and water globules other towels have.
B000NW8CXC|5|I arrived item thank you
B00YJL95XY|5|Good stuff
B00P922Y58|4|Solid construction, only complaint was fitment. Everything fits properly besides the drivers side turn signal cutout. the holes were too small and required come very minor cutting.<br /><br />overall I would recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade their jeeps looks on a budget.
B00I3RBDDK|5|Installed perfectly on the 11/98 M52TU in my 1999 328i. Fixed my misfires and rough idles at a shockingly reasonable price. CEL went off after ~30 miles. Fits older engines. See below.<br /><br />The DIY was not as bad as some would lead you to believe. Honestly, the hardest part is plugging in the hoses. Other reviews say the o-rings in the kit are oversized. They seemed reasonable to me. It helps to have a good eye of what surrounding parts you can disconnect to make a little more room. I had no issues with fitments. All hoses fit just fine.<br /><br />Tips:<br />• Just rip the old CCV valve out. It'll probably break in half. No harm done.<br />• Personally, I mounted the new CCV before plugging in hoses. It's easier to get leverage on the hose when the CCV valve is securely mounted.<br />• Removal of part '0318 (the little intake manifold you connect the return hoses to) is required. I can't imagine doing this DIY without removing it. Four screws and it's out, and you have so much more clearance. Why some DIYs say this is optional is beyond me.<br />• The angled return hose has a screw-lock, not a clip!!! Examine the old valve and hose first for help. This is the most difficult hose to connect, but the screw makes it a little easier. (Removing the intake and power steering reservoir helps a lot here. See below.)<br />• I didn't know the return hose was screw-in initially. It popped out the moment I started the engine. A symphony of terrible noises was my engine without that hose.<br />• Again on return hoses: screw the hose onto the CCV valve first, thread it through the manifold second. Saves you lots of frustration.<br />• I didn't replace any connecting o-rings when I did this DIY. Though you should!! *looks at you sternly*<br /><br />Parts to remove to give you a little more room:<br />• ECU firewall (a huge help for removing the throttle & dipstick)<br />• Fuel breather valve and mounting plate<br />• Power steering reservoir (not fully, but unscrew the two13mm bolts and lean it aside)<br />• Air intake (above the radiator)<br /><br />A minor aside that came up for me: contrary to the part database, this kit fits fine in older M52TU engines made prior to 01/00. This kit comes with parts '4536 and '4535 for return hoses; older engines call for '0317 and '0035. The part database says they're non-interchangeable. They are interchangeable. I just installed them on my 11/98 engine and they fit perfectly. The only difference is the older return hoses connect with a hoseclamp and the newer ones have an integrated clip. The distributor that connect to, part '0318 (the little spindly intake manifold), appears to be universal for all M52/M54 engines.<br /><br />Codes this cleared for me:<br />P1188<br />P1189<br />P0170<br />P0173<br />P0300/P030X
B000C0WKUG|5|excellent replacement item
B006U42QUC|4|ok
B005PZMLDY|4|Be careful with these. They tear easily on the seam  and straps if you are pulling them tight so be gentle. These fit my 2012 ford escape. My only complaint is I can't figure out how to get the middle seat belt through  (you have to cut your own holes in the cover, which is actually a good idea because cars can have different sized seat belt holes) no one can use the middle belt.
B007V5X0UY|5|It looks just right
B005J1UK2I|5|Good product.
B007CN9IJW|5|These work great! Only downside is I have to take them off every time so the seatbelt will retract properly. However, it's only a few extra minutes to put them on and take off, but well worth it because they hold so much better than the plastic versions!
B00AF6N2CM|2|Doesn't do a good job of picking up radio stations.
B0048FHAMY|4|Exact fit.
B00J9F7J0Q|5|Mehr is an excellent brand. I've gotten several key chains from this seller in the past, and was very excited to get these two dragon ones. They come two in a pack, and they're both the same, so one can be given as a gift. I gave one to my husband.<br />Most of their other key chains are much sturdier, these felt a bit on the thin side, but the design is very intricate and pretty, just as I was hoping. The price isn't bad either. I wouldn't put them on, say, a backpack and then go hiking, but they would do well on s wallet, or even as a phone charm. I have an affinity for dragons, so I might be biased. But once again, love this brand!
B004I116OG|5|Works great.  Fit perfectly and even had lights and sockets and all
B0041CDUDW|5|Awesome pipe!  Came with everything needed for installation. Good sound too!  Short and sweet, I didn't want a big bulky exhaust pipe
B00ARL6HJK|5|The seller is a good comunicator and the item i liked.
B009LQ79CG|5|Fit perfect
B000HEBR3I|2|It works great for a while and it stops working after 6 to 8 months . I am on my third one less then a year. I had one years ago that lasted a long time. It is hard for me to hold a 5 gallon gas can and this made it simple. Would be nice if the warrantied it .
B0018A87A6|5|love it!!
B00DNU3OAM|4|Sturdy battery terminal clamps.
B00AQIDXVO|4|It was a good match for the part it replaced in a 2007 Camry
B000ALBRAG|5|Work as advertised.
B00192JFBI|5|Also perfect! Easy to apply and arrived on time.
B007TYRAEE|5|Fits perfectly on car.
B009PP5IBM|1|Really bulky. Clip is a little to tight which makes it hard to clip on my belt/pants pocket. The blade likes to release when using not happy about that.
B002FDEKTM|5|Nice product, but doesn't fit on a Mini Cooper that I needed them for.
B00ODDKFLE|5|Nice set, many sizes
B00009PGNS|5|We got this specifically because we were traveling from California to Canada  and would be gone for 3 weeks. I cook for my dog so I had to have something to keep her food fresh once I opened a home canned jar or frozen meat product for her. It worked very well just as described.
B0095PU2YU|5|Was just as advertised, good quality.  I would purchase again.
B00IKJ7ZS8|5|They stop car shipped quickly
B00AKA6NUQ|5|worked perfectly on my '04 911
B005SHRY36|5|Great price for pads.  Will see how they hold up at 20k and 40k miles.
B007XWDH1M|5|Perfect fit and function.  Had to watch a utube video for replacement instructions.  Took about twenty minutes including the time to watch the video.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B004AIHKT2|5|PERFECT fit and FUNCTION!.  Can't believe the original little hook piece was plastic...just super glad it broke right in front of my house and when I had no real urgency to move the car for a few days.  Wouldn't have had a clue what the heck happened except for wonderful people in YOUTUBE land!!!  Thank you!!
B001AI6YU6|1|I purchased these to mount on the fork tubes of my 2003 VTX 1800C and they did not fit although they said they are for my particular bike.
B00BTLEJAQ|3|rear seat covers do not fit properly for my Chevy Captiva
B0118AG8Y2|5|All I can say is HE WON... GET OVER IT SNOWFLAKES!!!!!
B00W2P11ZE|5|These are perfect and look great.
B000C9I0Z6|5|Worked like a charm.
B00IJ43YSO|5|It was easy to remove and replace the new one which is a bit with more resistant. I like it.
B00BUHLCHW|5|Works just like the original but at lower cost.
B0068FU3UI|5|Easy to install.  Great comfort, non-slip grip.  Be sure to pick up some grip glue or Gorilla Glue to install the left grip as it comes without any.
B00G0P0I60|5|Toyota Tundra pick up trucks from 2007 have this part holding the radio antenna through the front fender. Texas sun & heat bake the rubber to brittle death in 7 or 8 years. This new replacement installs easily with simple pliers (to tear out the hardened remains of the old part). New part simply slips in like you'd expect. No hassle. Clean. Genuine.
B00GT1UJJG|4|It filters water.
B000C9RTQW|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00KB76DEY|5|Fit great and protects the seats as it sould!
B000GOG3P6|5|Perfect fit for the replacement of the original.  Hopefully this one will last 15 years too.
B008427D88|5|Perfect for my 2015 Honda Rancher
B00GHT85BY|5|I took it to my mechanic to install in my Highlander and he said Dorman makes very good products--good quality/value for the cost.  His shop buys a lot of Dorman aftermarket products.
B0036U5UDI|3|The reason I gave it three stars and not more is because the front of the roof has no provision to catch the water run off. On my 2010 Teryx I only have the half windshield and the water will run off the roof and right into your lap, dash, and feet. Now that being said if you have a full windshield it might be just fine as the water would run onto the windshield first and possibly not get the front riders soaked....but I'm not sure of that. As far as keeping you out of the sun and affording you some UV protection it does a good job. The build quality is very good and no complaints there. Honestly I would have gave it 5 stars if I hadn't encountered rain.
B0042B4B3U|5|I had one of these years ago to use inside the house when the dogs got on the couch.  This worked amazingly well to get the hair and &#34;stuff&#34; off the carpet in my jeep as well.  GREAT TOOL.
B00HSDH1KY|5|Exactly what I was lookin for...thanks!
B00E1SLIDK|5|Fixed a noisy wheel.
B002KCWWFC|5|Why would you use anything else?
B006OQ35GU|5|Well built, easy to install and takes all the guess work out of whether or not your tank is clean. Great price too!
B004I0ZAHG|3|It a little smaller than the original one but to work
B002ZBWKAU|5|Built in pressure gauge and dial in pressure is great.
B00GHT6RCI|4|5 minute install, cover material not as nice as original, time will tell how durable product is
B00DXF5PU4|5|Fits perfectly on my Chevy Silverado 2500 HD 2004. Very satisfied with quality
B00EP9BX6W|5|Old pair rusted and broke. These seems solid and well made. Had to squeeze together a bit to install, but look and work great.
B001JDE6ZW|1|I ordered this product yesterday and paid for express 1 day shipping and received it today. I am very disappointed to say the least. When the package was opened one mirror ha a broken rubber seal, so it will eventually fall out. The other mirror was not put together properly. It is not securely placed in the metal housing; the back of the unit , in the upper right corner. So it is defective and will negatively impact the function of the unit. I  will be returning the product for a fully refund.
B00KY56NCU|5|Used it to flush the brake system on my 2005 F150. Worked outstanding and made bleeding the brakes possible as a solo operation.
B0009N0W60|5|Can't beat it for the price good detail in the artwork arrived on time very happy thank you
B0016GXOXW|5|Great product!
B004P5G2GM|1|Awkward and takes up space for the person in the seat.  Not at all user friendly.
B00T6K3CS2|5|I'm an old guy and this is a bit large and heavy, but I manage. It does the job as advertised.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works well fits well
B001BSAXFM|5|I use my whisk broom with my dust pans.  Over time it will get shorter as the bristles wear out, especially using it outdoors on concrete.  I think I average about 10 years before I have to replace it.  It is inexpensive enough to have several handy when you need them.
B00W92O4VS|4|OK
B000C2ZKDI|5|Just like the ones in the store. Good price.
B0101U6OVW|1|Lame as can be. Is this guy 4 real? Get a life trump. And learn some hair styles.
B00AN5USRC|5|arrived as promised
B0006H8BGC|5|Exact fit.  Great product.
B00C7Y5K20|1|DOES NOT FIT THE NEW BODY STYLE 2009 RAM and up.
B00HCQA6AY|5|Put this on my dads 2015 reg cab Silverado. They look really good on his black truck. Glad I went with the Westin brand bar. The packaging was excellent. The bars were bubble wrapped and secure in the box. Also the hardware box is glued in place so it doesn't slide around and scuff up your bars. Just do not over-tighten the bolts and you'll have no problems with this kit. I highly recommend this kit.
B000C9DQMI|5|Good quality brake pads.
B000C9OSJ8|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00I50553E|5|Fit&works great,been on the truck for couple of months now no problems. Used it to clear Raptor wheels looks great! Great deal for the money!
B00XDAF0JK|5|Just put it on and it went straight in like factory! Installed on a 2007 sportster custom. Can't wait for night to really try it out! Word of advice if you install make sure you switch is on low beam before u plug it in. Can't attest to the longevity yet but I'm very satisfied!
B000ND0WB6|4|OK for the price...you get for what you pay
B00D5ZT6NO|5|Use prior to Bondo wood filler for stabilizing damaged wood.
B001FLALMU|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00EP6VEHI|1|The glue came off that holds the mesh to the grill.
B000AMXSUC|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B0032HC04W|3|I bought the product name, Bestop and was disappointed at the fit and finish.  The clamps work, but are pretty weak, in my opinion I would not keep the top permanently installed with only the clamps provided.  I laced the provided rubber spacer the clamp so I wouldn't lose it and the clamps did hold the top on for my trip from Florida to Maryland, but I kept looking out the back to make sure the top was still there.  When I unpacked the bed, I noticed that the clamps had shifted a bit and the rails were no longer flat to the sides of the bed.  Before returning home I purchased some stainless steel hardware, drilled some holes, and bolted the rails down to make sure they would stay.  I was also disappointed about the way the top fits on my Nissan Titan.  There is about a half inch gap between the rubber flap and the top of the bed at the front (enough so that I could push the loose tie down easily between the top and the bed to keep it from flying around and rapping on the back of the cab) and there was a full inch gap at the back between the tailgate and the top.  I also didn't like that it only latched on one side.  I will investigate whether I can purchase and install a second latch for the passenger's side to keep the top latched.  Clearly Bestop thinks it's not needed, but I and my brother-in-law both thought it odd that it was not included.
B007C7EJVK|5|Works and fit perfect..I'm waiting to see what it does on mileage on my first trip..
B0009618HO|5|Gave it to my Son-in-law for Christmas for his shop
B00D1CQVIY|5|Great product thank you so much
B0017VJOIU|5|Works perfectly
B00B2LCE1E|5|I never write reviews. These parts fixed harsh shifting in my 07 Pontiac g6 2.4l. Awesome and totally worth the money. Awesome buy.
B004BLAU0E|5|I bought this for my ez pass transponder because the glue on the original ceased to work.  These strips are longer than the original but work just fine.
B002OAR6O2|5|Great bars!! Great price!! Buy these!!
B007MFZEXO|5|Just as described.  Be sure you have enough room for mounting.  Sounds great.  Install will take some time to do correctly.  Have not mounted mine yet.
B002E56ONG|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00REZ8YV6|5|Product: Quick and easy installation. Not one item was missing and easy to follow directions.  The color and size of the visors fit well on my crv.<br /><br />Customer Service: Excellent customer service. Quick turn around time when emailing questions about products or about the shipment.<br /><br />Overall, will recommend WellVisors. Great customer service and top notch products.
B002YI72TS|5|Love it.
B004QEJ6UQ|5|perfect fit on my new jack
B00KTHVE72|5|Perfect answer to the problem, and for about $150 less than buying a new one as suggested by the dealer and O'Reilly's!
B002M1SQ24|5|Use these on my 2008 Nissan 350Z -- Fit perfect, much cheaper than dealership or elsewhere.. Work perfect!
B001GJ3E2K|5|love this brush
B001UG4WIO|5|great
B005CLNV3K|5|great door handle. replaced my original handle in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ half doors. Look and function perfectly.
B00BUS5BGO|5|Perfect fit for a 2016 Forester with power door
B00MQF0QL0|5|Item seems to be of good quality I got what I expected haven't put them in yet but I'm sure they work fine
B000KKOGLO|5|Great amazon value.
B00HJCX05O|5|Easy to install.  Looks great.  Looks like it came from the factory.  It easily accepted mounting accessories to carry my kayak.
B00WU5P2TM|5|Worked great!
B0077M24EY|5|I have a 2015 Tiffin Open Road.  Fits the louvers perfectly.  The only cut out I had to make was for the drain hose, which was very easy to do.  These also come with little wire ties (2 per screen).  You'll have to add more if you want a snug fit.  I have about 4 ties per screen.
B00IL8BMUU|5|As expected good quality
B00QCHU578|1|It doesn't stick
B00G8WLX78|5|Heavey duty excellent clamps.
B000V2W0GE|5|This item was added to our previous order to make the water system in our camper work more efficiently.  It arrived on time with the other two items and was easy to install.
B001UGNJ6A|5|just what we were looking for, work as described, make thing much easier!
B00AIFZ3BI|5|Some of the best wiring I've ordered in a long time. Very good. And true gauge wire. Definitely will be ordering from these guys again when I do my big 3
B00BFDFP60|5|My cooling system was getting air in it after bleeding it twice it finally dawned on me (duh) that my cap was bad. Cured the problem. This was on an 2002 Civic EX. Factory cap managed to get 94K miles on it.
B00BRL6M6C|4|My color was lighter then what expected but I broke the 'code' for everyone complaining about fit/not fit. I have a 2006 camry and I noticed that there are a few different shaped mats here. Pay special attention to the front and back on the passenger size. For some reason mine, to fit, needs a funky bump on the left side for the front. And some on the back passenger side has an oddly shaped notch out. The key is looking closely at your mats and matching those two items and you should be good to go! I however am returning the ones I received due to the color being a light beige color rather then a soft grey like this appears.
B00KYJ23HA|5|Nice unit. Works great.. I'd get it again.
B00GKLH5JW|5|Love it!
B00LBAC5S8|1|Difficult to install in my 2014 jeep and it definitely is NOT meant to stay in place under my hard top. I was unable to get freedom tops to seal with this in place. Ended up removing and didn't use after 1st week.
B002FXQ3FQ|5|Nice and bright.
B00T0ZVMUI|5|Great product just what the doctor ordered for my Corvette if you have a c-series Corvette you understand about this thing sucking oil into the intake, will this puppy takes care of that and it looks nice to got it on time and very happy with the product
B0010Z4MDK|4|I ordered this to replace the battery in my home security system. It was delivered quickly and was easy to reinstall. My only criticism would be that even though adapter clips were included which I needed to fit my connectors there were no directions and it took me a little while to find them and realize adding them would do the trick to complete the job. Initially frustrating but in the end it worked.
B001GN1FNG|4|It is what it is supposed to be, I would not have needed it if a quality 1.25&#34; ball were available.
B00171V1WC|5|Fits fine for my 2008 ford focus.
B00JYMZ8HK|4|Didn't have any problems with it camping and it stays plugged up at the house.
B00HV2KH9E|5|Install was straight forward. Only took about 2 hrs to complete front and rear. After alignment she was ready for the 2k mile trip.
B006ORF3BY|5|fit my gv250 perfectly
B006VU3762|5|This stuff lasts a long time
B0031GTXQW|1|Not worth it.  Twice this brand and model failed the emissions inspection.  TWICE.  I mean, with two different caps...just in case I wasn't clear.
B000GTXD4K|4|Like
B0000UUX34|5|Just as described. Great product
B002CKT9T4|5|Excellent products!
B00B5H7ZRS|4|exactly what i was looking ,not installed yet ,for a upcoming project
B00ATZHGBC|5|Nice quality connector - exactly what you're expecting.
B000BUU5YU|4|like the handles on the ends, should be easy to hook up, haven't used it as of yet.
B002MQS9YY|3|It's almost right, needed to buy new screws cause the old screws didn't fit plus was a little difficult getting on real tight fit for sure
B000BODVEW|5|Great, low cost option if you need a new adapter or can't find your old one.  Used all of them several times and no problem.
B00EPJDVBW|2|All contents scattered. Shipped in this aluminum case thats halfway falling apart. Ballast's dented, scratched up. Ballast brackets are useless flimsy pieces. Overnighted this kit due to losing both of my old ballast's after installing new bulbs after 6 years of no problems. Installed anyway &#34;need lights&#34; Lucky everything works. Fast start up. No flicker, but pissed about the used $hit they sent me. 2 stars becuase it works........
B0085OKAEE|5|Love this key chain. Doesn't fade, great buy!
B002OKVGSO|5|Exactly what I needed. Perfect fit no hassle install. Done in 10min.
B00U2Q61P0|3|Sometimes it works, other times it doesnt. May be my relay but im not sure. All in all, it's very bright
B001KR3FWM|5|it works
B007DBIENY|4|I purchased this item on July 31, 2014. I loved it until two of bulbs burned.<br />  However, according to product description it has 50000 working hours, which means that if all the time lights are on it have to work approximately 5.7 years. what a shame
B00ONGWQG8|5|Look just like OEM or maybe better on my 98 Toyota avalon
B004GE1MUI|5|fit the van perfect, still in use no issues at all. comes ready to paint
B002R1T7R2|5|Thanks
B00EYK54AS|2|Doesn't handle heat inside of hid projector light.  This was a blue color at one time.
B000GD5FMY|5|Good
B001898WRA|3|The right door was already used. The fitting pin that Connect the two doors together did not fit correctly and they were damaged... and the adjustment collars were missing.
B00RMAJP2K|4|They are definitely brighter than the stock incandescents. The rear dome light bulb was slightly smaller than the stock, required bending the contacts in to hold the bulb in place. You'll probably have to reinstall at least some of the bulbs as the polarity only works one way and there doesn't appear to be a way to know if they are going in correctly until after their installed and activated. Wait to check the function before putting the whole unit back into place.
B004C24XUA|4|Love them. Have used them all summer. I had to put more holes in the yoke to raise them above the exhaust pipes. They seem very durable. I like the little outside pockets for quick access to little things. Zippers holding up well.
B0096069IW|2|Good quality item, however I found it very difficult to work with. Even after spending a considerable amount of time reading instructions and watching YouTube videos, this product was hard to install. Although advertised as having a low initial tack and air release, I found the initial tack aggressive and repositioning almost impossible. I would suggest you experiment with a small piece first and also compare installation against other similar products from 3M and Avery. I ended up only doing my project partially with SimCarbon and the rest I did with Plasti Dip.
B00IIM6DSU|2|Good concept and simple design, but the seam on the side panel just ripped open when I gave it a light tug....It just fell apart there.  Should have been better stitched.
B00PC2ZA1U|3|the item looks old and used... got some scratches on it...
B0000D8ZQS|1|This did not fit my 1972 omc 9.5 outboard. I ended up getting  a factory part.
B00CIJPU74|4|It's a sticker. Of Jerry Garcia's hand. What more is there to say? I had a guy in Eugene Oregon tell me he liked my &#34;undercover Deadhead style&#34; so if that's what you're going for...here's your sticker.
B0049ELS54|5|This works great. It does fit a 2004 Jeep Liberty, even though Amazon says it does not fit. Works perfect and your light will not come back on.
B00B1FQJV2|3|Color is off
B0056BXREO|4|Came quickly and is what I anticipated.  It looks like it will work as intended.  I wish there was an option to place it towards the back of the cargo area.
B00N5UBQHS|5|Works great to keep my Battery Tender Lithium battery topped up - when it even needs to be connected.  I usually don't leave it on the charger as it holds charge very well.  It is installed in my 2006 KTM 450EXC and has never failed to start the bike.
B00OFUXL16|5|very bright!!!
B00G3Z18DE|5|On time, and exactly what I expected.
B003MWFE8Q|1|wrong piece.  would not take it back
B007TN15EG|4|Make flaring easy. Better than the Eastwood product which I bought and returned.
B00W4YA492|3|This product is truly very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone with for use in their vehicle or even for a recliner.  I would easily have rated this 5 stars but when I received the product the fabric on both the lumbar support and next support appeared to have been snagged in several locations.  The fabric streaks of fuzz sticking out which doesn't make for a very nice appearance.  I'm am not sending the product back because it is a long drug out hassle to box things back up and make arrangements for UPS to come and pick things up.  There would also be the inevitable wait time before a new product arrived.  I travel in my vehicle quite often and I'm gone for long periods of time so I did not want to wait for a replacement.
B00MY3K6FU|1|Very bad brake dust. Worst I ever saw. Squeaked like crazy even with anti squeal. Replaced with Wagner, problem solved.
B00E1SNYFK|5|Awesome brake pads and rotors, better than you get at your local auto parts store.
B00IKKBSCG|5|Great chrome finish, fast delivery
B005UO6EWE|5|I'm pushing almost 300k on my 02 excursion. The starting problems started and boy I'm going bend over for injectors. I'd been reading about another brand and after reading here and elsewhere I decided to try it. Snake oil or not. I had nothing to loose. I had the dread hard start white smoke freight trane on start up when cold. No power till truck warmed up and was good or so I thought for the rest of the day. Fresh oil change and the magic bottle. Took truck on 200 mile trip. I notice about 150 miles my throttle response was way better and my injections sounded like new. Well fast forward 7000 miles later. 2nd oil change and fresh bottle of archoil my stiction problem is GONE! My milage went wayyy up, truck starts very easy when cold, full power at take off. The injector knock as i call it is alot less noisy and if you can belive this now when i let off the throttle you dont hear the injectiors out of sync when truck is slowing down. This stuff flat out works. I highly recommend this product and no I'm not some paid person.  I Dont believe in snake oil products but these guys nailed it. It should be in every powerstroke or diesel engine regardless of make.
B0007LVJ2A|5|Worked great
B000C2SBU2|5|right thing for right price
B00JNL5XQS|5|Perfect for 2012 Chevy Equinox.
B00BG3XJ2Q|5|This fuel pump was installed on a 1965 Ford Fairlane Sport Coupe with a 289.<br />It is the correct mechanical pump for this year/model car.<br />Installed easily and works like the original.
B004TM7VXE|4|Cheaper than OEM and looks exactly the same. Same ride quality.
B0009VD174|1|I bought this in May and didn't put it on my van until August. The weather was nice and hot, so it should have been the ideal time to put this on (according to the instructions). The bra did not stretch far enough and in the process of trying to get it to fit, the seam ripped. I go to return it and get a replacement, but I'm past the 30 day return policy. I guess I'll put my sewing skills to use and fix it. Maybe I can resell it if I still cannot get it to fit my van.
B000CPJLHG|2|This VHT paint doesn't seem to work any better than any other high temp paint. It is very fragile before baked and will come of if gas or solvent cleaners come any where near it. Not worth the extra $$ in my opinion.
B00C03FWUS|4|Nice look in his NY Knicks room.
B0094E01TS|4|Monster 750 was a good fit replacing a beatup metal chin fairing. I added black wrap to the pipes and used the hangers from the old fairing to mount this part. The exhaust was close to the fairing so cutout were needed to keep the fairing from smoking and melting even with the heat wrap. Like other reviews no hardware was provided. I added grommets in the existing holes to prevent the threads on the mounting screws from elongating and it is a high quality part.
B00BQYCIVI|5|This is the one you need for drying your car.  This is really hungry for water and sure works better than chamois.  Suggestion..just get three of these right away to avoid ordering more later.
B004J88BZU|1|Made in china
B00ISA49WO|5|The install was easy enough without directions. I used the box it came in as a rough template by tracing the outline of the fender onto it and trimming it back. Even with a damaged preexisting fender; I was able to fix the preexisting and use it to mount these. I used the Morris 4x4 smittybilt tube fender install video on YouTube to help me have an idea on how to install these. Lots of good advice on YouTube. Explore it.<br /><br />Pros: great look to these bad boys, straight forward install, adds clearance for flex (if you're into that kind of thing), makes bystanders give you the thumbs up, very rugged (that tree got the mark on it, not my fenders), it's a bargain.<br />Cons: tight spaces to wrench upon install, ride quality suffers due to aerodynamics, no preexisting holes for hood latches
B0007LKZVG|5|Works great, has trouble with nails though
B000EQU1DQ|4|Works great for my application.
B000C123W0|1|Posting for product shows gasket and 4 studs.  First order received had only two studs and NO gasket.  Also, the studs are M10, not M8 as needed for the 4.6L Ford engine.  The 5.4L uses the M10 studs, but this kit is listed for both engines.  Replacement order had the same two M10 studs, but had a gasket.  Also, the bag of studs was opened with one nut missing and no paperwork.  Obviously, this item had been opened and returned, then sent on to me.  If you get this manifold, or its sister manifold, 674-407, get some stainless M8 studs and either re-use the OEM metal gaskets, or get the Fel-Pro metals.  The fiber gasket supplied in this kit is useless and will not last long.  Get some nickel anti-seize, Permatex 77134, with this order and use it on the SS studs (or any stud you use on the manifold).
B003L8WUBU|4|Not bad.  We use it as a boost for the kids to get up to the camping trailer steps. I wish I wouldve got one a little wider however.
B001DRFJUK|5|easy to install and looks good
B004RIU1SM|2|The lettering looks great, fairly easy to install.  The only problem was the number zero was domed for one side and more pointed for the other.  My mistake for not fully comparing and inspecting the numbers before applying.  When I contacted the seller they stated on no uncertain terms that it was impossible that they sen the numbers that way and it must have been my fault during application.  I have several watercraft and have applied registration stickers to all with no issues.<br /><br />So the seller, after sending photo's stated that I could buy an additional number for $2.50 plus shipping.  At this point it wasn't a money thing after paying the high price to begin with, but principle.  They are not reputable in my opinion and I could not recommend.  Gave 2 starts because the product itself looks great.
B00407NK6A|5|Works great
B00T5DJ4VE|5|Thanks
B002M3ODTC|4|This is a well built ramp. I use it to take my bike with me when I go drop off my truck at the mechanic. I found that I need to get additional lights installed because with a bike on the back of the truck all the lights are covered.<br /><br />The packaging however, was missing the 6 required nyloc nuts that hold the front stop and the tire rocker in. I had to go to home depot and buy and additional 6 nuts to finish putting this together. so I had to pay an extra 10 bucks to get the nuts I needed to put the frame together.
B000M8RYMC|4|gift
B00YC1SJR4|5|They work just great.  Price was much better than the other LED options available to fit on the 2002 Harley Ultra Classic.
B00ZJICU5G|5|perfect tool for my job at hand / pretty heavy duty,made short work of a other wise big job.
B00XZ70V5O|4|I would have given 4.5 stars if I could. I like them. The front hole in each didn't match up to the ones on he truck, but it was easy to put another hole in the liner at that point. It also allowed me to locate the hole in a place that snugged the whole thing up a bit. The instructions were very good. Plan on getting your arms dirty. Have some patience getting the holes lined up and the liner under the fender lip. It fits well and looks great. Installation time was 30-45 minutes.
B00T7GYDTC|5|Wow this thing is bright!
B00008RW9V|5|This Mini Duster is a perfect size to keep in the trunk of my new car, ready to use whenever. It replaces my large size California Car Duster in the trunk, which is used regularly, it certainly helps to keep my car shiny and clean, we will absolutely continue to use it as well.
B00HE4DVPQ|5|I'm picky with decals since my car is my other baby, but damn, these are great! Professional quality and easy application with the top layer you peal off. Amazing. I'm very impressed and the price is excellent. Will definitely be buying again from this seller. Well done guys, well done. And the shipping was fast. That made my day.
B00WU4KMT8|5|Works well, and there is a TON of fuel coming out of the fuel pressure regulator back through the return line. So i can only imagine that this thing is flowing a LOT of fuel, at high pressure. Not sure what the lifespan of the pump will be, but i'm impressed so far. The pump is not very loud either, its just loud enough to hear it if you're really paying attention.
B007HMTLCC|1|Product does not match car paint.  A total wreck
B00OEJZISM|5|I live in the South (NC) and it gets pretty hot and humid outside. I also took this jacket to wear on some of the hotter days in Colombia, Ecuador, & Peru when I didn't want to wear my heavier touring jacket. On some of the hottest days, it kept me safe (at least feeling as safe as possible on a motorcycle) and as cool as you can get on a hot day on a motorcycle. Long story short, I don't think it added to the heat. Just be sure to drink lots of water because you won't get very hot, but you'll surely sweat.<br /><br />Built in armor seems to be good quality. I love the fact that there are several vents. Thank God. Fits great (I did order a size up from reading other reviews), nice spot for the phone/earbuds to come through, zippered pockets so things don't get lost on the road. I'm happy with my purchase.
B00D6N0QG6|4|It's ok
B0084JNQIM|1|Product fit exactly but didn't work.
B009OAWPTG|4|There's a lot right here, but a lot of opportunities for improvement as well. I don't want to say it's a bad product, cause it's not. So I'm giving it 4 stars even though I'm returning it. It's just not for me.<br /><br />To preface this, I bought this hoodie as I was looking for something for brisk morning ride ins. In the morning I'm usually commuting for an hour anywhere from 40F to 65F degrees. I wanted something that could take the chill off and be able to ride around in the afternoon once it got warmer.<br /><br />Pros<br />- The kevlar coverage is great. Really impressed there. In fact there's more Kevlar than I expected. The whole back side of the hoodie is lined, not just the part where the armor is.<br />- The fit is true to size out of the box. But I'm concerned about shrinkage. There's nothing saying it's &#34;preshrunk&#34;.<br />- CE rated armor in shoulders, back, and elbows. Very nice. Though I will say the armor that came in my Dianese and Rev'It jackets seem more sturdy but only just a bit.<br />- Stitching seems good<br />- Lack of annoying logos.<br />- Cellphone pocket is pretty large and will take larger phones<br />- awesome price for what you're getting.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Because of the armor, this hoodie looks ridiculous.  I'm not a large guy and so I look like I'm doing an imitation of Hanz and Franz.<br />- Waist elastic is waaaay over-tight. Supposedly it's for sealing off air flow and to prevent &#34;ride up&#34; but all it does is just make it annoying when going to zipper up. I also don't notice any real improvement in prevention of &#34;ride up&#34;, in fact the only thing it does is not go back down once it's ridden up.<br />- WHY ARE THE ZIPPERS SO SMALL!?? This is almost impossible to operate with gloves.<br />- As heavy as this hoodie is, it allows a LOT of air flow (stood in front of an AC and could feel the cold air seeping right through), thus completely negating the purpose of why I bought it.<br />- needs bigger/more pockets. Especially in the front, aside from keys, there isn't much you can hold in there.<br />- While the sleeves are a perfect length, the torso needs to be longer. This comes down to my waistline, but it would look a LOT better if it were longer.<br />- Needs more colors than black.<br />- The cotton part is a little too heavy for my tastes. No matter how heavy the cotton is, it's not going to hold up in a scrape, and as I said it allows for a lot of air flow, so it's rather pointless being this thick and heavy.

Especially in the front, aside from keys, there isn't much you can hold in there.<br />- While the sleeves are a perfect length, the torso needs to be longer. This comes down to my waistline, but it would look a LOT better if it were longer.<br />- Needs more colors than black.<br />- The cotton part is a little too heavy for my tastes.

B000IYRODY|5|Great price, works perfectly. Love Prime shipping!
B00IPDQWLK|5|I put these on my Harley trunk and man do they light very bright.  I get complimented because they are really visible day or night
B00J4UTRGU|5|Love it. Superior customer service.
B00TXVNZQI|5|I really liked it
B005LXTOHQ|5|Got it quick and it was very easy to install. Depending on how long it last this review will remain good.
B000ALG18O|2|unfortunately did not fit my car and I had to return it
B00XLX4ICO|3|Same complaint as others, does not stay in ear, but does work. Wind interference with Mic communication
B00UFERZKO|5|Bought it for a cross country car trip. Powered and charged 3 cell phones and a gaming laptop just fine. The 2 USB ports are a nice feature and it's quite enough to not even know it's running when traveling. Everyone stayed connected the whole trip except for dead spots:)
B00UIU9VS4|2|Buyer BEWARE!!! I had these bought for me by friend and when I installed them, they both blew out the very day I used the car March 31, 2015), I went on a 290 mile journey and both ballasts blew out. I had the Seller informed and they sent a pair of Ballasts (not branded as the ones that came with the initial purchase). I installed these only yesterday (August 26, 2015), and 1 of the ballasts did not work. It actually arrived blown. Only 1 is working. I cannot use it. Unofrtunately, I cannot wait for the next replacement. I will find a better product to spend my money on. And it did not come cheap, $69 is no chop change. Very very disappointed.
B00QT2ZF30|5|Fit perfect on my Ford F-150,2000 and the quality is fine for the price
B00QRHDIPY|5|Smaller and lighter than I had expected, so convenient to take in my side. Affordable price, good choice of connectors and clamps. When i got it, i was fully convinced with the description said, easy to use. What’s more, it charges the 12V batteries with the power of the sun and creates 5 watts of energy, which is why I purchased it. All well. Good value for the money.
B00O65H77O|4|Excellent product. Installed super easy. Sounds awesome and performs well.
B0082LK87Y|5|Great polish for your porter cable buffer and 3M polishing pads
B000H8XL8I|5|fit perfectly and I have used it for several months now with no issues.
B00F23BNUG|5|Excelente
B00IKZTRLA|5|Very Cool.
B007ZDFF4G|5|Easy install and look good.
B00I796HS0|4|it filters oil
B00NWQ88MQ|5|great sticker
B005MQS92S|5|Love the look.  Made of plastic though.
B00K7XWNKA|3|It doesn't fit quite as snug as I'd like and it's definitely not the same quality as a Jeep product, but I would say for the money that this is a decent buy. My spare tire had some rust on it, and I wanted to mask it since my car is otherwise in tip top shape. This dressed her up just enough.
B00Y195OR0|5|Ordered an extra one by mistake but it worked out my son bought a new car too.
B0009IQXCC|5|This works very well. I had used another well-known product on my Boxster S dash, which left it shiny in some places and dull in others. After using Meguiar's the dash has that original soft matte finish. No more shiny and dull.
B0001UZUW2|5|What a fun way to kill pests!! Got this for my husband, who has an affinity for swatting all things airborne. Gave it to him last night & I think he actually fell asleep with it in his hand😂.<br />No really, I don't think he's put it down since I handed it to him. It works for the most part from what he's said. He does not recommend going after wasps with it, however- &#34;they have too many friends watching their backs&#34;.....<br />Inexpensive & fun. Like it.
B00CMXRJJ8|5|It worked! Better than the original. Fit perfectly too.
B000EDE6EO|4|Great product must purchase
B000VDYQXS|5|I loved my car mats!!
B00192JFBI|5|perfect fit for our pop-up camper
B00KXSFV76|1|did not work well at all.
B00G20IY0A|5|These things take a long time to arrive, but they seem to be of very high quality.  Remarkably high quality for the price.  They look really good. The anodized finish is very impressive.  There is a steel braided line from the reservoir to the piston, which is totally overkill.  That's an unpressurized part of the system.  I think it's just there for looks.  They are adjustable, and the adjusters are nice and firm.<br /><br />They are essentially &#34;Shorty&#34; levers.  I don't think I knew that when I was ordering.
B001DRLO7W|5|I put cat on my 2004 Honda accord 2 door 2.4L. Along with a new front pipe and new muffler. Once the new exhaust system is on my car, it made a huge difference in power and fuel economy. Normally i get about 28mpg where i live, now i get over 30mpg, with a manual transmission. I was able to buy and install the new exhaust system for around $500, so its cheaper then other systems but i really like it. And the system is VERY loud. My muffler came with a silencer and you have to drive with it in or you would be attracting some cops. The cat is also smaller than the one that came with my car, so more gas can pass through it faster. If you have a accord around 2004, get this system, it is very good. This cat, DNA motoring muffler and walker front pipe (all on amazon.com) if you want a new system, this is the way to go.
B000GZJ1WW|5|Filter air like a champ. OE quality replacement part.
B001D7AQAI|5|Seller was expedient in shipping Although the listing was incorrect in these items being camber adjustable the item is great
B00YVQD4A2|5|Been using this for a few weeks now and am quite pleased with its performance. Sunglasses clip to it firmly and am happy enough that I subsequently bought one more for a friend who complimented it. Caveat that it seems to hold glasses with wide temples better than it does thinner wire style. Otherwise, like the way it's designed to hold at least two glasses.  Doesn't seem like a product that will disintegrate anytime soon, as reviews about other similar products have complained about. Happy buyer here.
B00NLMCOVW|2|Not size that is advertise smaller . Fabric or matirial is like paper . not a good cover
B00T8I48VM|5|These look great on the truck, really add a nice accent to it.  Emblems came flawless.
B0089IMEWW|4|Cover a little difficult to put on, but settled in nicely once sun shone on it for a couple of days.  Appearance is great.
B00IG0C202|5|This company really hooked me up. These lights are awesome!! Install was too easy! Communication is top notch with this company!
B00FM7B1AO|5|Using on a 2013 Nissan leaf. Works great sooooooo much faster than charging with the trickle charge/110Volt charger. No problems with the install me and a friend installed in about 3 hours.
B002N5DE2G|5|good to have as back up
